If you remember Pearl Harbor... you'll recall that in the year that followed... the Japanese were almost invincible.
Early in 1943, however, they were checked.
Stopped cold by the Marines at Guadalcanal... the Navy in the Coral Sea... and the Allied armies in New Guinea.
This was a period of far-reaching decisions, desperate strategies... and incredibly daring counter-strokes... not the least of which involved... two bright young naval officers.
This bold, slightly improbable adventure began with a message... authorized by the Commanding General,
South West Pacific Area... and flashed by top priority to the lone carrier on patrol in the Coral Sea.
It was an urgent request for a particularly qualified young officer... to lead an extremely delicate missi髇.
It demanded a man... a man of executive ability and high intelligence... and that innate quality that enables a man to swiftly estimate a situation... and make a wise decisi髇.
In bestowing that most thrilling of all awards, an officer's first command... the Navy knew it had a man that would ask no questions and offer no excuses.
He would carry out orders regardless of what obstacles fate put in his path.
Well...
Within the hour, with high hopes and only a mild headache...
Lieutenant Rip Crandall was on his way... to a secret anchorage, a hidden harbor, so shrouded in mystery... that it was known only as
"somewhere in the South Pacific. "
Here, the U.S. Seventh Fleet, victors of the Coral Sea... drowsed at anchor, licking their wounds and dreaming of the great battles to come.
And here, the Lieutenant saw his passport to high adventure.
Here, somewhere among the flotillas of destroyers... their vital supply and repair ships... among stalwart battlewagons of the Nevada class, carriers... deadly cruisers of the Boise class, escorts, and tenders of all classes... he found the ship of his dreams, the Echo... in, well, a class by itself.
While at first glance, it might have looked like England's reply... to the Boston Tea Party... it had nevertheless had a distinguished career in the copra trade.
The Navy had not only gratefully received it from New Zealand... as a sort of reverse lend-lease, but had taken great pains... to man it with a picked crew of specialists.
Dedicated, highly skilled seamen... who chafed at inactivity here in this quiet backwater far from the battle lines... and awaited only the arrival of their commander to swing into action.
Duck!
Bring that gear aboard.
Welcome aboard, sir.
What? Belay that racket!
You want the whole flotilla to hear us?
What is this?
Honors for the prospective commanding officer, sir.
The officer in commissi髇 shall see that all honors and ceremonies-
This hulk is commissioned? As what?
- It's unclassified, sir.
- I can believe that.
Duck!
Sorry, sir. All right, bear a hand, there.
Let's get that thing in port and secure it!
- Johnson?
- Yes, sir?
I'm sorry, sir, but we've only been aboard a couple of hours.
- How many men have you lost so far?
- None, sir, just a few cuts and bruises.
Don't forget Miller, sir.
Yeah. Yeoman Miller, sir.
Transferred to the hospital ship.
He's a real nut, sir.
I told him to look out for the hatch, and he thought I wanted a match, and...
Thanks, Johnson.
You can take this man below and show him where to stow his gear.
All right, sir.
What is all this malarkey about this ship being commissioned?
It's true, sir. Admiral Hathaway had me commissi髇 her... and sign her over to you.
The papers are in your stateroom.
My what?
Your cabin. You can go right ahead.
I'll bring your gear along.
Yes. Just leave it there.
Sir?
I'm sorry, sir.
I meant to warn you about these beams.
You gotta watch it.
- What did you say your name was?
- Tommy.
Sorry, sir. Hanson, sir. Ensign Thomas J.
Let's sit down.
My name is Crandall. Rip Crandall.
I know that. I'd have recognized you, even if they hadn't told me.
You know me from someplace?
Balboa. The California Yacht Club.
You were getting ready for the Honolulu race in '39.
What did you do? Crew for me? Or...
I tried to, sir.
You're not the kid that fouled up the genoa jib?
Oh, gee.
I remember
I was a little rough with you that day.
- Didn't I chase you up the mast?
- Yes, sir.
You said I didn't know enough to pour water out of a boot.
Boot. That was nice.
You were right, sir.
I nearly wrecked your ship.
But I've studied a lot about sailing ever since. That's why I volunteered.
You volunteered? What? For this?
Yes, sir. I had a desk job here at the base... and when Cmd. Vandewater told me about this-
Vandewater? Not Wilbur Vandewater?
I don't know. Kind of slim, blond hair.
And a blackguard Nazi! That nose-
- Sir?
- What does he do here?
- Flight secretary to the Admiral.
- Yes, he would be.
You have to take him those clearance papers when you've signed them.
- This ship's not officially yours until you do.
- lt isn't?
You're right. It isn't.
I'll get the ship's boat in the water so you can take it.
Do that, Bill. Tommy. Wait a minute.
You got a copy of the Navy regs?
- ln the top left-hand drawer, sir.
- Thank you.
Anything wrong?
No. It's just that I do everything by the book, you know.
Your gear, sir.
I already got that gaff secured.
The gaff. Chief.
Watch...
For your information, it's not a gaff, it's a boom. The main boom.
Yeah. Sorry, sir.
Mr. Hanson has been teaching us.
The gaff is the...
The spar that, on this ship, you would bend the head of the foresail to.
You didn't make your rate in sail?
No, sir. But do you think the rest of these clowns know anything...
Beg pardon, sir.
My last hitch was on The Hamill, the tender alongside, sir.
- And you volunteered, too?
- ln a manner of speaking, yes.
That is, no, sir.
You'd see it in my record anyway.
It was this, or else.
Else what?
Chief Svenson started his fifth hitch.
And the Chief's mess gave him kind of a testimonial... and I figured a party is no good without entertainment... and they got this girl dancer at the tavern.
I see.
Nothing like that, sir.
Her husband came with her.
Only...
Only it's wartime, and unauthorized civilian personnel... are not allowed on naval installations.
Particularly tenders, the skipper said.
So he gave me my choice of being busted or grabbing the first ship out.
So, you volunteered. What, the first...
- The first ship out?
- That's what they said, sir.
- I've got to get out of here. Pardon me.
- Sir!
All clear? Lower away together.
If you don't mind, I'd just as soon you didn't mention it to Mr. Hanson.
He really believes I did volunteer, and he's kind of young and eager... and you know?
Let go of the after fall.
Let go the forward fall.
Chief, your secret is safe with me... because I'm not going to be around to tell him anyway.
Leaving the ship.
I should have checked the caulking, sir.
It's okay, kid, it's nobody's fault.
Don't you worry about it.
But we'll get you ashore, sir.
Won't we, Chief?
Yes, sir. Right away, sir.
Horse, slack your stern line.
Shark Bait, heave around on the bow.
Get that thing aboard.
- He can handle anything, sir.
- Yeah, I'm sure of that.
- He can't wait till we get to sea.
- Yeah, I'm sure of that, too.
- What's up, Chief?
- Brass, coming through.
Right this way, sir.
- Family entrance?
- Dock is on the port side, sir.
Show the Captain the quarterdeck, sailor.
Welcome aboard, sir.
With him in command, we could sail right into Tokio Bay.
- I'd settle for just getting out of the harbor.
- He can do that blindfolded.
Yes, sir, but I don't think he's going to.
He didn't take them papers, sir.
He forgot them. He must have.
He's got to sign them. Can I still catch him?
Sir, you get them papers.
I'll see that you catch him.
Ahoy, the weather deck!
What do you want, Jack?
A new rubber band for the engine?
Got a special delivery for the dock.
Can you handle it?
Yeah. Hey, Boats, throw the hook over the side.
Just put your foot in there and hold on tight, sir.
Jack, don't forget to tell him to get a transfer.
Yeah! You have to switch over when you get up there, sir.
Okay, let's go.
Easy, Leahy! Take it up!
Okay, Boats, bring him up.
If you're looking for your brother, he's in a scow on the other side of this monster.
No, sir. It's me, sir. Tommy.
The Chief had the ship's crane put me on the dock.
That Chief. He's just full of ideas, isn't he?
What's the rush?
I promised I'd meet some guys at the Officers' Club for dinner.
- I just thought I'd walk in with you.
- It's a little early for dinner, isn't it?
Yeah, but you know, junior officers have to get in and get out.
I was hoping you'd have dinner with us.
I'd like the fellows to meet my new skipper.
Thanks, Tommy, but I'm not your skipper yet.
You see, I haven't signed those papers in your pocket.
Yeah. I figured you forgot them, so I brought them along.
- You really didn't forget them, did you?
- You didn't think I did, did you?
I know the ship doesn't look like much, sir, but it's no scow... and once the men get to work on it, you'll be surprised.
If it's on account of me, sir, don't worry, you can get another junior officer.
Wait. Look, kid, this has nothing to do with you.
It's just that I don't want to get stuck on that ship, you see?
But it sails, sir.
And it might have an important missi髇.
Tommy, if it was the Vanderbilt yacht,
I wouldn't want it, kid.
Do you see all those ships?
That's only a fraction of the Japanese fleet.
Do you want to go up against that in the Echo?
Yeah, maybe you're right.
I guess I'll have to give these to Cmd. Vandewater myself.
I'll give them to Vandewater.
I'll take care of him. Where's his office?
Headquarters building.
Behind the tug mooring, sir.
Thanks.
Look, kid, I may end up as your skipper yet... but you understand why I'm trying not to, don't you?
- Yes, sir.
- Okay.
How do we set up now, Maggie?
Cpl. Hathaway's office called at 17:00, sir.
Col. Harris at 17:05.
Briefing's at 18:30.
- That'll clear the deck, sir.
- Fine.
- Is Lt. Crandall still waiting?
- Yes, sir.
But I'm sure he understands... that you have a full schedule and won't mind.
No. Send him in, please.
Yes, sir.
Permissi髇 to secure at 18:00, sir?
Permissi髇 to... Sure.
And get me Admiral Hathaway, would you?
Tell me, once you secure at 18:00, what would you be doing, Maggie?
Keeping a date at 18:01.
With the base efficiency expert, of course.
Of course.
Stun the crows.
Flag secretary returning the Admiral's call.
Yes, sir. Got it right here, sir.
- Somewhere. Hi, I'll be right with you.
- Yeah.
Sir? Absolutely, sir.
What is 19:00, anyway?
7:00. I might have known you had your finger in this.
All steamed up about my new command and I end up in a Chinese junk.
What are you talking about, Rip?
- I thought you were at sea.
- I was, and very happy... until I get orders transferring me to a grain barge masquerading as a Navy vessel.
- The USS Echo?
- Echo?
Say, is that the racing sloop-
Joke's over.
I've been aboard this career-wrecker.
I was hoping you'd report here first, so that l-
You could con me into it?
She's a brute, isn't she?
I'd liked to have seen your face when you went aboard.
But it's no joke, Rip.
- This is an important assignment.
- You're getting funnier by the minute.
No, I'm serious.
Gen. MacArthur himself wants her delivered to New Guinea.
Why?
Why?
You know, I asked him that same thing.
I said to him, "Doug," I said...
"why do you want that old hulk sailed to New Guinea?"
- And he said to me, "Van, boy"-
- "Drop dead."
What's MacArthur got to do with the Navy, anyway?
Say, you have been at sea.
Let's just say that he mentioned it to Admiral Hathaway... and Admiral Hathaway suggested that I get with it or else... and l, in turn-
You saw a chance to do a favor for an old sailing buddy.
Rip, I swear it, your name popped out of the lBM machine... with five or six other ex-yachtsmen... none of whom I would trust with a canoe.
And if you don't think it's a favor,
I heard about your fitness report.
That popped up, too?
You should get your next promotion around 1980.
Come on. Now, look.
All you've got to do is slip up inside the Great Barrier Reef... run across the Coral Sea, and take her into Port Moresby.
It's blue water all the way, prevailing winds-
Enemy planes, enemy subs.
400 miles of open water,
I got a crew of cherry pickers.
You beat me to Santa Barbara once with five Sea Scouts.
But that's got nothing to do with this.
No. I picked you because you're the only man I know who can do the job.
Now I get it. Now, what,
I sit on that bucket for the duration?
The ship's to be turned over to the port detachment in Moresby.
What they'll do with it, I don't know.
That's their business.
All you've got to do is get it there.
You'll be flown back here for reassignment the same day you drop the hook up there.
Now, why don't you just sign the papers and get it over with?
Wait, a reassignment to what?
You'll have demonstrated your fitness for command.
"D," maybe.
Maybe even a destroyer.
This is a chance half the guys in the fleet would give their eyeteeth for.
How come I feel like I'm buying a used car?
How much time do I have to train, Van?
A couple of days, maybe.
- Or more. Let's see, to be in Moresby-
- Not a chance.
Now, look, Rip...
I don't want to have to lean on you, but if I have to-
You'd have done it when I first walked in.
I don't have to take that ship.
Don't have to face a court-martial, either.
A prospective commanding officer must first certify a ship in proper condition-
That applies to assuming command in a naval shipyard.
Paragraph 1 does.
Paragraph 3 states elsewhere-
All right! For a direct commissi髇 you got to be a sea lawyer in a hell of a hurry.
Skipper had me memorize a page every time I goofed.
Then you must know the whole book by heart.
But Admiral Hathaway isn't that soft.
Good luck on your next duty.
Wait a minute.
Van, just give me 10 days to train.
Tell you what, give you an extra day.
That's impossible, and you know it.
I don't know anything, except she's got to sail.
Under the second officer, if necessary.
The kid? But that's insane. He couldn't.
You know as well as I do he doesn't have the experience.
Do l? Maybe this will give it to him.
- Did you talk him into it, sir?
- No, but I got him worried.
- Keep working on his conscience, mister.
- Aye, aye, sir.
Kid, what's with you and Vandewater?
Nothing, sir. He just told me to stand by.
There might be new orders for the Echo tomorrow, sir.
What are you doing here, anyway?
I just came over from the Officers' Club, sir.
I thought, you not knowing the base,
I'd show you where it was.
I was hoping you might have dinner with us, sir.
Sorry, I didn't mean to be so suspicious.
Thanks.
The new orders, sir.
Does that mean you got the transfer?
He's gonna talk to the Admiral.
- You'll get it.
- What makes you say that?
With your experience, they'll have to give you a command.
Good officers are scarce.
Command? If Admiral Dewey was still running the Navy...
I'd be a big man, but he ain't.
"lronsides" Hathaway is.
Where did you say that Officers' Club was?
Over there, in back of the shelter.
- I would like a double anything.
- Yes, sir.
Do you have any chit?
Have to get it from the mess officer.
- We're not allowed to take cash.
- Here, sir. You can use mine.
I couldn't do that to you, too.
I mean, it's bad enough that... Never mind.
This is the officer
I was telling you about, Arthur.
Lt. Crandall? This is a real pleasure, sir.
There's nothing too good for you, sir.
Mr. Hanson was telling me you are going to command the Echo.
If you need an extra hand,
I sure would like a transfer.
If I were going to command the Echo...
I doubt that we would observe the cocktail hour.
No, sir, he didn't mean that.
He's a real sailor.
Did two years as a deckhand before the war.
Right, Arthur?
Right, sir. The Old Escobar out of Frisco.
But that was power.
And there's nothing like sail, is there, Lieutenant?
Coming right up, gentlemen.
You know, once the sea gets in your blood,
I guess you never get rid of it, sir.
Tommy, The Old Escobar out of Frisco is the ferry to Oakland.
I've been on it. I wish I was on it now.
Yes, sir. Sorry, sir.
Did Cmd. Vandewater say who they'd get, sir?
No. I imagine they'll find somebody. Why?
No reason, sir.
I just thought, with you in command,
I'd get real practical experience.
I've been studying up on seamanship and navigation-
Tommy, if you knew
I was gonna be your skipper... you and Vandewater cooked this thing up.
No, sir. Not until I saw your name on the orders this morning.
No pretzels.
Then what difference would it make who got the assignment?
None, sir. Except I thought
I'd try and show you...
I wasn't as stupid as you thought I was.
In Balboa.
- I told you before. That was five years ago-
- Excuse me, sir.
The two gentlemen with the nurse are waiting for you, sir.
Thanks. Won't you join us, sir?
I told them about you, too.
I see. And you primed them full of the salty talk... on how they were gonna sail with me, too?
What are you trying to...
I'm sorry. It's really nothing.
I've got a lot on my mind.
It's been a tough afternoon. You run along.
- I'm sorry. I'll join you later.
- Yes, sir.
Arthur.
Would you like me to freshen it up a bit, sir?
- You're gonna freshen that up?
- You can't fly on one wing, sir.
- Thanks, Jimmy. And don't bother to wait.
- Yes, ma'am. Thanks.
Coming through. Pardon me, gentlemen.
Do one of these.
Kid, I got one that will stop you.
Okay.
Do you know what it means to miss New Orleans
And miss it each night and day?
I know I'm not wrong
The feeling's getting stronger
The longer I stay away
Miss the moss-covered vines
The tall sugar pines
Where mockin' birds used to sing
And I'd like to see
The lazy Mississippi
A- hurryin' into spring
The moonlight on the bayou
A Creole tune that fills the air
I dream about magnolias in June
And soon I'm wishing that I was there
Do you know what it means
To miss New Orleans
When that's where you left your heart?
And there's somethin' more
I miss the one I care for
More than I miss New Orleans
Wonderful, boy.
Tommy, you're magnificent. Wonderful.
Hanson, you were the... Wait a minute.
Where are you going?
We're just getting warmed up.
We should get back to the ship, sir.
We have to get the anchor watch set.
Ship's security.
Yeah, you're right. I'll just finish this.
Here he comes. I love your work.
From the time we came in here this afternoon... this guy's kept my glass filled with whisky so you can shanghai me.
Where'd you get
"we gotta go back to the ship" business?
Will you fill me with the sauce and then...
No, sir. You left your gear over there.
And you haven't got a place to stay.
Until you're reassigned, I mean.
Right.
I could stay at the Bachelor Officers' Quarters.
Yes, sir. I forgot.
I'll have them bring your gear over.
No, wait a minute, kid. I'm sorry.
I've been needling you all night long... and you haven't done anything to deserve it.
It's just something is eating me.
Look, just chalk it up to the fact... that I'm a heel, and you're much better off that I didn't take command.
No, I couldn't do that, sir.
You have to do what you think is right.
- I'll have them bring your gear over.
- No.
Leave it there and I'll pick it up sometime.
Give me a chance to see the hulk again.
And you.
Thank you, sir. Good night, sir.
Take care of yourself, kid.
Miss Typewriter of 1943.
What happened to your efficiency expert?
Did he get his head caught in a filing cabinet, I hope?
Never mind, old daddy's here.
Arthur. Old daddy's here.
Would you bring this girl something tall and cool?
If you don't mind, Lieutenant,
I'm looking for an Ensign Hanson.
He's your date?
He gets around better than I thought.
This is official Navy business, sir.
I have some documents which must be signed by 23:00.
There you go with those numbers again.
Ensign Hanson just left, ma'am.
I could try and catch him.
He left in a fast jeep. What documents?
I don't believe that's any concern of yours, Lieutenant.
It's in connection with
Ensign Hanson's ship, the Echo.
I see. At the moment,
I'm still under orders to take command.
And if you don't mind, anything concerning the Echo also concerns me.
Would you step into my office for a moment, please?
Arthur! The wine.
Here we are, open for business.
Let's see the papers.
I understood you were to be reassigned, sir.
I don't think I should.
I haven't been reassigned yet.
Give me the papers.
I want to see the swindle
Vandewater's trying to pull.
This has nothing to do with Cmd. Vandewater.
And I don't think Admiral Hathaway would appreciate your terminology.
They're the acceptance papers from the Echo.
The Admiral wants them signed tonight.
- By Ensign Hanson?
- By Ensign Hanson.
If you really need him, his ship's down at the end of the dock.
- I can send a fellow over for him.
- You're a little over-trained.
If you're not careful,
I'll have you transferred to the Echo.
Yes, sir. Sorry, sir.
He did it. He wasn't bluffing.
I think that Admiral will have his grandmother made skipper.
Are they all in order, sir?
Right down to the fine print.
In that case, you can't have any objection to Ensign Hanson signing them.
Where did you say his ship is?
- Bye, Arthur.
- Bye, sir.
Now, Lieutenant, look. I told you, the Admiral wants those papers signed by-
- They will be. You got a pen?
- Yes, sir.
But they have to be signed by the officer taking command.
I know that. Give me the pen.
Gosh, Lieutenant, after the way you behaved this afternoon...
I wouldn't have thought a team of horses could've gotten you on that ship.
Shut up.
Well, missi髇 accomplished.
- Good work, Hanson.
- Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.
I guess. Good night.
- Shark Bait, will you just try to stay with it?
- I'm sorry, Chief.
Good morning, sir.
Beautiful morning, Captain.
Horse.
You might have better luck... Chief.
You might have better luck with that thing if you laid the gasket on the boom first.
- Yes, sir. Lay the...
- Gasket.
Under the foot of the sails there, on the boom.
Yes, sir.
- Your coffee, sir.
- Thank you.
What was in that?
That was an egg, sir. And Mr...
I thought it'd settle the grounds, sir.
Something wrong with it?
Yeah. I thought I swallowed my tongue.
Mr. Hanson meant eggshells in the bottom of the pot.
Not a raw egg in the cup.
What were you before you entered the service?
I was a cook, sir. I've been one for years.
- I'll have another cup. With grounds.
- Yes, sir.
Shackle the foresheet to the traveler.
Good morning, sir.
This to that.
- This is supposed to be the winch?
- I beg your pardon, sir.
- Winch?
- Yeah.
No, sir. This is a spark plug, sir.
I was talking about the engine itself.
This is the power takeoff?
Beats me, sir.
Mr. Hanson just told me to get it running.
I see. What's your name?
Sparks, sir.
- Radioman, Second Class, sir.
- Yes, all radiomen are called Sparks.
I mean, what is your actual name?
That's it, sir. A.J. Sparks, Jr.
Funny, ain't it? I mean, being named Sparks and making radioman.
It's very...
All I wanna know is if this is the power takeoff?
I wrote my old man about it.
And he's A.J. Sparks, Sr.
But he darn near died laughing.
A fortunate thing he didn't.
Ship rigged and ready, sir. Request permissi髇 to send watch to breakfast.
I'd like to see the foresail set first, mister.
The foresail? Yes, sir.
Chief!
Set the foresail.
Aye, aye, sir. Stand by to set the foresail!
Chief, get a load of this.
- Man the fore halyards.
- Man the fore halyards!
- Stand by the foresheets.
- Stand by the foresheets!
Take this line and wrap it a couple of times around the winch.
Get that line ready for running.
Come on. Get that other line clear.
Stand by to hoist away.
All hands, stand by to hoist away!
All hands, stand by to sink!
All right, break it up, you guys.
You got nothing to do?
Sir, the winch is still being repaired.
Shall we take it up manually?
No.
Have the men stand down.
I wanna talk to them.
Stand down.
Sir?
Stand easy.
That was pretty miserable, wasn't it?
No reason why it shouldn't be.
With the exception of
Mr. Hanson and myself... none of you knows the slightest thing about sailing.
Nobody expects you to.
However, this ship sails for New Guinea Friday morning.
Once we're at sea, any sailing order that isn't carried out... sharply and efficiently could cost any or all of you your lives.
Now, I can't make blue-water sailors out of you overnight.
But you are all Navy men.
If you're willing to work 18 hours a day for the next three days...
I think I can teach you enough to get by on.
But if you can't cut it... if any one of you thinks that he might endanger the lives... of the rest of the members of this crew, then put in for a transfer, and now.
There's no disgrace to it.
I'll be in my quarters for the next hour, any man who wants to see me.
That's all. Dismissed.
Chief, I prefer that you and Mr. Hanson remain on deck.
Let the men decide this for themselves.
What do we do if they all quit?
- Hello, Johnson.
- Yes, sir.
You didn't eat very much, sir.
I wasn't very hungry.
Not that there was anything wrong with the food. I just...
Men eat yet?
Yes, sir. They ate real good.
- Kind of quiet, but real quick.
- What do you mean, "quiet"?
Sir, a couple of them said something about seeing Mr. Hanson and the Chief.
They wanted to see Hanson and the...
Upper shroud, lower shroud, topping lift.
Upper shroud, lower shroud, topping lift.
Jibstay, forestay, foremast, stow.
- How about that?
- Don't knock it. It works.
Gaff, foresail, gasket.
Gaff, foresail, gasket.
Callahan, standing or running rigging?
Blue standing, red running...
Running rigging, Chief.
Sheet or halyard? You.
Sheets, trims, sails, halyards, hoists.
Halyard, Chief.
- Which one?
- I don't know.
They'll know her by tomorrow, sir.
With your permissi髇, the crew'd like to take another run at setting the foresail.
- Very well.
- Okay, Chief.
Aye, aye, sir. Stand by to hoist the foresail!
Shark Bait, throw up the...
- Gaskets.
- Gaskets.
Horse, stand by the foresheet.
Halyards to the winch!
Come on, you told me you'd get that thing working.
Sure. When do you want it for?
Now, you idiot. You think you're back in that service station?
Take up the slack.
- Set the foresail, Chief.
- Aye, aye, sir.
Stand by the mainsail. Engage the winch.
- Spark!
- I'm trying!
Hoist away!
Take it easy! You'll rip the mast out.
Slack it easy.
It's stuck. Heave!
It's stuck, sir.
- It's stuck, sir.
- Yeah.
Did you grease the mast? That's all it needs.
Don't worry about it.
You better bring it down.
Okay, slack it off and lower away.
Slack off and lower away!
It's still stuck. You get a man up on the rig and kick the gaff jaws loose.
I'll go myself, sir.
One volunteer. You.
There's nothing to it, sailor.
- Yeah? Why don't you go?
- Move.
Can't we talk this over, Chief?
He's scared to death, sir.
If he doesn't do it here, he'll never do it at sea.
Come on, boy. There's nothing to it.
You'll be all right, son.
Just take one step at a time, okay?
Take it easy. Now, don't look down!
Close your eyes.
Now, when you open them, look straight ahead.
That's a boy. Just keep your eyes level... and go on up one rung at a time.
You can do it.
That's it, sailor. Now, go ahead.
Now, I want you to go on up... until you are level with the gaff jaws.
You know what they are?
- Yeah.
- All right.
When you get there, and when you're ready, just reach out... and see if you can kick them free with your foot.
You understand?
That's the boy. When you feel it, I want you to reach out with your right foot... and kick the gaff jaws loose.
That's it. Reach out.
Don't look down!
Now, kick it loose.
Hook your foot in the shroud.
I can't.
Take another turn around that winch and hold it fast.
Take it easy, kid, I'm coming.
I'm slipping. My hands are slipping. I'll fall.
Stop that! Wanna land on someone?
Got you.
Let go with your left hand.
Oh, boy.
I would've fell.
- lf you hadn't been here, I'd have let go.
- Never.
- Hang on, I'm going up and kick her free.
- Okay.
Hang on, kid.
All right, lower it away, Mr. Hanson. It's free.
All right, lower away, Chief.
Slow now, slow. Slow.
Pull what you got.
Wait for me!
That's my ship leaving.
Will you let me through, you guys?
That's my ship.
Wait a minute, boy.
What you got in the bag?
For Pete's sake, I'm gonna miss it.
It's leaving.
He's afraid of missing that?
Wait for me! Wait! Come on! Wait for me!
- I made it.
- Yeah. Nice going, sailor.
Now, bear a hand on the bowline.
We're just coming into the dock.
Say, you have got a few, haven't you?
He's a nut. But he's eager.
Here goes nothing.
- You'll be back before you know it.
- Just be sure I am.
The order's on my desk.
See they get processed, will you, beautiful?
Just pop them into that little lBM machine.
I'll square things with you when I see you again next Friday night.
Are we getting an lBM machine, Commander?
- My, that'd be-
- Yes, we might. Good luck, old boy.
Good landing.
You can take her on out now.
Aye, aye, sir. Stand by the line.
Not now, Johnson.
Chief, I want all this gear stowed before we hit open sea.
Aye, aye, sir.
Come left, mister.
I said, come left.
You're cutting across the bow.
It's no use. She won't answer the helm.
Did you drop the centerboard?
Get up there and do it!
Go down and give me full speed astern.
- Sparks, back full quick!
- Back full, sir.
Not another one!
Come on with that centerboard!
Come on, you monster.
Centerboard down and locked, sir.
- Full speed astern, sir.
- Full speed ahead!
- Full speed ahead!
- Right, sir. Full ahead, sir!
Mister, will you get a helmsman on that wheel... and set sail, while I go below and change my clothes?
Yes?
Shall I notify the Admiral's office of the time of departure, sir?
Yes, please, Maggie.
While you're at it, you might notify air-sea rescue... to be on the lookout for a ship in distress.
- Now what?
- I think that Australian ship's saluting us.
They always cheered the Christians before they threw them to the lions.
- You getting the sail up?
- Yes.
I'll be right up.
He's off to port.
- He's off to port.
- He's off to port.
- Sparks, kill that eggbeater.
- Yes, sir!
What are you doing here?
Thought you left an hour ago.
The weather report said winds up to hurricane force in the Coral Sea.
I thought you might have a message.
- From that little boat, I mean.
- Ship.
They're under orders not to break radio silence, remember?
You're really worried.
- Did you fall for that wild man?
- No.
Mind you, he was kind of cute.
Don't worry about him.
The rougher it is, the better he likes it.
He's having a ball out there.
Besides, the last aerial sighting put them way up here.
They're probably beyond the storm and just loafing along.
If I ever get my hands on that Vandewater...
Yes, sir?
Get this from the files immediately, please.
Now, then... what's the report on that schooner we sent to Moresby last week?
- The...
- Echo, sir.
She rode out a storm Tuesday night and was sighted from the air yesterday.
From the position report, they'll raise the New Guinea coast-
Don't guess, Commander. I want to know.
That ship is a vital part of joint operations.
- The Echo, sir?
- The Echo.
What do you know about an officer named Foster?
Lt. Dennis M. Foster.
Why, nothing, sir. Should l, sir?
He's been assigned to take the Echo to Cape Gloucester.
Cape Gloucester on New Britain, sir?
Why, that's enemy territory.
Very good, Vandewater.
It also happens to be an excellent place to watch Japanese ship movements.
For the past six or seven months... the Australians have had a coast watcher there doing that.
Then, two weeks ago, in the middle of a transmissi髇... he went off the air.
Killed? Taken prisoner, sir?
I don't know.
But that's why the Echo was sent to Moresby... on a faint chance that it could take in a replacement if everything else failed.
A sub couldn't drop the man off at night?
What was the Spearfish doing in the Solomon sea last week?
Uncharted reefs will make it impossible to get anywhere near the coast.
And an airdrop is out of the question.
No, it's got to be a shallow draft vessel like the Echo.
The Australian replacement is in Moresby waiting for the ship to arrive.
As soon as it does, this man Foster is supposed to take command... and try and make the run up to Cape Gloucester.
I'd feel better if I knew more about him.
It's a ticklish job.
I'll get Lt. Foster's file out immediately.
I've got it right here.
He seems to be qualified, and Capt. McClung picked him.
He commands port detachment of Moresby and ought to know what he's doing.
He wants to hold Lt. Crandall for a few days... until Foster's familiar enough with the ship to take over.
Tell him he can have Lt. Crandall for as long as he likes.
Yes, sir.
Lt. Foster will not relieve Lt. Crandall... until, in the opinion of the port captain...
Lt. Foster is fully qualified to command the Echo.
That means I can hold Crandall here as long as I like.
- That make you any happier about Foster?
- I've got nothing against the bloke.
He's just not the type that I'd pick for a mate.
- He's a good officer.
- The best. A real sterling character.
But if you can have this Crandall bloke, why can't he stay in command?
Because his job is to acquaint Foster with the Echo, that's why.
Of course, we could try sending you in again in another sub.
Now, wait a minute.
I'm crazy about Foster.
- Where is that flaming ship, anyway?
- Simmer down, Pat.
She'll be along.
On deck!
- What's that?
- I can make out a pier in the harbor, sir.
Nan. Easy. Roger. King.
That's her, Mr. Foster, the Echo.
I was afraid of that. A tub.
All right. Contact and please pass the word to stand by for special instructions.
Aye, aye, sir.
There's a building at the shore end.
That must be the port detachment.
Fine. Sparks, ready on the engine.
Some navigation, mister.
Have the boatswain stand by to down sail.
- Sir!
- What's the trouble?
I wish I knew. I can't get it started.
I checked the ignition system, the valves, the pumps.
- I'm going through the fuel lines.
- Can we take her in under canvas?
- No room to maneuver in there.
- We'd be going in in style.
In style?
As long as we don't end up on the beach.
How long is it gonna take you to fix it?
If I can find the trouble, not long.
But if I can't?
We have orders to get in as fast as we can.
Get with it.
Wipe that grin off your face.
This isn't as easy as it looks.
Keep the deck.
Hold that beacon in your port bow... till I give the order to come about. Hold this.
No reason to get excited.
It's a tricky maneuver.
If you handle your duties as well as you've been doing, we'll be all right.
There's one very important thing.
We'll be on the wind when we fetch that dock.
I must come up fast, lose weight, try to coast alongside, understand?
- When we start to luff-
- That's when the sails flap?
Right. I want every inch of canvas down as fast as possible.
- Mister, stand by to come about.
- Man the sheets. Keep a close haul.
Tell the man up the crosstrees to watch the gaff jaws.
- I don't want them sticking again.
- Aye, aye, sir. Guys, keep your eye on the-
- Somebody's firing at us.
- Over us, so far.
What did we do? Lose the war already?
- Who's responsible for firing on that ship?
- I was trying to warn them, sir.
They've not answered our transmissi髇 and don't know of harbor defenses.
She's already in the harbor!
Did it ever occur to you she might be on a radio silence?
They're coming any minute.
Get down and warn him off.
Yes, sir.
- Where are you?
- I'm sorry, I can't get the engine started.
Get the transmitter.
I want to know who fired on us and why.
I can't do that either.
It doesn't put out without the engine.
- Sir!
- What?
There's a flashing light on the dock.
Take out the hand blinker.
Stand by to come about.
- Aye, aye, sir.
- All hands stand by to heave to.
- What's the matter with them?
- They're going right into it.
- Got them now, sir.
- Tell them.
What do you got?
"You are...
"approaching..."
Cancel it, they're already in it.
Tell them quick.
Cancelled. Restart, sir.
All they're telling us is we're approaching a Navy dock.
"You are...
"in...
"a...
"fine...
- "area."
- lsn't that nice?
Must be the chamber of commerce.
What are they saying?
- Excuse me, sir. That "F" was an "M."
- That's different.
- "You are in a mine area."
- Mine area? Get directions, quick!
Lookout, keep your eyes peeled for subsurface objects.
There's something there now, sir!
Dead ahead!
There they are! Two of them!
Dead ahead, sir!
- Orderly!
- Another one, sir. Off the port bow.
Man the back stage.
Go forward, get that centerboard up.
She won't answer the helm.
It won't make any difference if we hit a mine. Go on.
- They request we move inshore, sir.
- Get back to that engine, quick.
Centerboard up and secured, sir.
Another one off the port bow, sir!
Another one at starboard.
They're out of it.
Tell them they're in the clear.
- We're all clear, sir.
- Roger.
On deck!
Low waters ahead, sir.
Lower away all sails, Tommy.
Drop that centerboard.
Sparks, put it forward.
Lower away all sails! Let's get this down.
The gaff jaws are stuck again.
Kick that gaff jaw free.
- Centerboard down, sir.
- Right!
You monster, come about.
- Sir, we're closing on the dock.
- What? Back full, Sparks!
Sir, we're gonna ram the dock.
No. Go forward and get ready to let go of the anchor starboard.
Johnson, bear a hand on the anchor.
Cameo, grab that line.
Stop it up short. Tend that line.
Sparks, I said back full!
Excuse me, sir, she quit on me again.
Go forward and rig the fenders on the port side.
Shark Bait, let go of the anchor and hold it underfoot.
Man overboard!
Look out below!
Nice work, mister.
- What did you say, sir?
- I said, very nice.
Is that all for this performance, or have you got an encore?
I'm sorry, Lieutenant.
This is a centerboard ship-
A ship?
Why, I was under the impressi髇 that it was a USO Tour.
This is an official Navy ship, sir.
The crew is doing the best they could under the circumstances.
This crew is doing the best they can?
I suggest you take this crew out for about six months.
Who the hell do you think you're talking to?
This is my ship.
Anything this crew does is under my orders.
If you have any further remarks about this ship or my crew... you come aboard and make them to me.
- Throw the sails.
- Astern to.
Thank you for your invitation, Captain.
Since I'm relieving you, that won't be necessary.
Whatever I have to say to this crew,
I'll say to them directly.
You're taking over?
As soon as you report your arrival to the port captain.
I would be obliged if you do that as quickly as possible.
Furl the sails.
Excellent, Lieutenant.
- At ease, please.
- Yes, sir.
You've done a remarkable job bringing that ship up here.
Thank you, sir. I had a remarkable crew.
Yes, I saw them in action as you came in.
I'm sorry you won't be commanding them on the missi髇.
Missi髇?
You don't think we brought that ship up here just for the ride?
I'm sorry, Lieutenant.
The missi髇 is top secret.
You weren't informed, were you?
- No, sir.
- Come here.
Temporarily, the ship is being placed at the disposal of the Air Force.
It's imperative that they get one of their men ashore... here on Cape Gloucester.
- ln New Britain? With the Echo?
- Yeah.
They seem to think if she's disguised as a Navy training craft... that she has a chance.
That's what they're doing to your ship now.
Camouflaging it.
And the Air Force will provide what fighter cover they can.
Fortunately, that won't concern you, will it?
No, sir.
You've met your replacement, Lt. Foster?
- Yes, sir.
- Fine.
I have Admiral Hathaway's permissi髇 to hold you here... until you can familiarize Foster with Echo.
- I know you're anxious to get back to town-
- That's all right.
It would take some time for the men to get used to a new skipper.
It won't take more than 48 hours.
- I don't suppose you would be-
- Sir?
Yes, Davis, what is it?
Air Force reports enemy bombers over the Solomon Sea.
They expect a raid in 20 to 25 minutes.
Mr. Patterson and the native corporal are in the briefing room.
Shall I ask them to wait for the all clear?
- The Lieutenant and I will be over directly.
- Yes, sir.
Warn Echo. tell those
Air Force people to clear the dock.
Yes, sir.
They're going up to make the intercept.
Our ClC Room is over here.
Bogie 1 appears to be splitting.
Designated raids. One Abel and one Baker.
One Baker.
We know there's a convoy building up here over BAM.
I'm fairly certain it'll take off in the next 10 days... run along the north coast of New Britain and land troops either here at Madang... or down here at Lae.
Lae, they'll land at Lae.
They'd be a month coming over land from Madang.
We also know that they'll be making a grave tactical error...
Mr. Patterson, that's right.
No Navy man would risk putting ships through narrow straits like that.
They'd be a sitting duck during an aerial attack.
- lsn't that right, sir?
- Absolutely, Lieutenant.
What Patterson is thinking of, though... is this weather front that's moving in from the central Pacific.
By the end of the week, this whole area will be socked in so tight... there won't be any chance for aerial observation.
That's why it's so vital... to get Pat in there to take the place of that coast watcher... who disappeared.
Tom Evans. Wasn't that his name?
Yeah.
Then we can hope, with Pat's help, to get a visual sighting from the land.
Would it be difficult to drop Mr. Patterson and the corporal by parachute?
If you ask me, it'd be flaming impossible.
I'd as soon go in with a brass band and a neon light on my hat.
Besides, I don't like airplanes.
- Or air raids, either. Goodbye, all.
- Stick around a few minutes.
They'll be concentrating on the airstrips.
Yeah, and they might miss, too.
Don't you get any wrong ideas about Patterson, Lieutenant.
If it weren't for him and the Australian coast watchers who hid in the jungle... when the Japanese occupied these islands, we'd be in a bad way.
Both here and in the Solomons.
Patterson and that native corporal of his... have spent the last six months right here in the hills... constantly in danger from Japanese patrols... and just as constantly sending us our vital information.
So don't-
Now, they're entitled to sit this one out, son.
One Baker. 050.
One Baker should be overhead in two minutes.
Very well.
You have air cover as far as the Trobriands here.
Across the Solomon Sea, you'll just have to pray... that the enemy thinks you're a native trading vessel.
That'll be two, maybe three days.
Right, Crandall?
I'm sorry, sir. This is the first time my crew's been under fire.
I'm afraid it won't be the last.
No, sir. Let me see, three days, you say?
If you took off from here at dusk, and you were sharp on celestial navigation... it could be two nights and a day.
Foster is a qualified navigator.
Thank you, sir.
You have a few days to acquaint him with the ship's peculiarities.
That won't be necessary. Thank you.
If this weather front does move down, you'll have to do some dead reckoning.
Why don't you let me worry about that?
Pardon me, but they're swinging in over the harbor.
Everybody but the duty section should be in the slit trenches.
- What?
- Your own orders, sir.
Welcome to the club.
- Where's he going?
- To be with his ship, I imagine.
Quite a bloke, that Crandall.
Duck!
The port captain's here, skipper.
- Kind of soggy out, isn't it, Crandall?
- Yes, sir.
We could run up the coast for a few miles.
I can show the Lieutenant how the ship handles.
That won't be possible now.
The size of that air raid shows the Japanese are building up to something.
Air Force wants Echo underway as soon as possible.
I see, sir.
Get underway as soon as you've accomplished the transfer.
Bring your papers to my office.
We'll see about arranging air transport for you to Australia.
Yes, sir.
After you, Captain.
Yes, come in, Crandall.
What're you doing here?
Why aren't you underway?
I request you to order Lt. Crandall... to turn over the Echo to me without further delay.
He's got me signing for equipment
I can't even find. He's...
Sir, he's getting underway.
He is?
No. He wouldn't do a thing like that.
Sir, he must be.
No, really?
He's taking it out himself, sir. See?
Yes, he is, isn't he?
My ship in that minefield again.
He knows where those mines are now.
Aren't you going to order him back, sir?
The Air Force would demand an explanation... for the delay, and-
Sir, this is a court-martial offense.
- What, Lieutenant?
- I said this is a court-martial offense, sir.
Yes, I guess you're right.
Still, he was assigned to me for an indefinite period.
For as long as I needed him.
I'll tell you what I'll do, Lieutenant.
If he ever comes back from that missi髇...
I'll consider a court-martial.
Yes, sir.
This channel of yours is less than 100 feet wide.
Is that the only break in the reef?
The only one I know of, and I've covered over 100 miles of it.
- On deck!
- What is it?
Another enemy aircraft on the starboard quarter... closing in on us, sir.
You'd better get below, sir.
Same order stands!
Don't fire unless they fire first!
Hold fire.
Drop dead, you creeps.
- Blow a couple of gaskets!
- Yeah.
Looks okay, sir. They're waving back.
Dogs.
I hope that's the last of them.
This thing's starting to itch.
It is. With that weather front coming, be lucky to make home.
Flaming shame if we didn't.
Run forward and tell cook to barbecue poultry for dinner.
We need a decent meal for tonight's work.
We'll hit that front in one hour.
By midnight, it'll be darker than 3-4 feet down a cow's throat.
- How will we see the reef?
- Nothing to it.
You can hear the surf pounding on the reef for miles.
Fine. How do we know how much water's under us?
That depends on the size of the waves, don't it?
Don't worry, I can take you through there with my head in a bag.
Yeah, you may have to.
Yeah?
Thanks for trying anyhow, Major.
Yeah, I'll be seeing you sometime soon.
No, sir.
He checked every squadron that had a plane in the area today.
That's absolutely the last time she was seen by anybody.
But that was at dawn this morning.
By late afternoon, they should've been somewhere up here.
What about that observation flight sent from there?
Canceled due to the weather.
You can bet the Japs didn't cancel that convoy.
If we'd just gotten that ship underway one day sooner.
Lower away all sails.
Stand by the engine.
I want full power going over that reef.
Tommy, take the deck.
Where did you say this inlet was?
- Straight ahead. Through those trees.
- Right.
At least the Air Force has been up here.
They sure worked that one over.
I guess so, sir.
Lead him.
I can knock that teacup right out of his dukes.
Don't.
He may have friends, like about 200,000 of them.
Just keep your eye on them. Don't get itchy.
You were going to glide through the jungle like a ghost.
- This looks like Hannibal crossing the Alps.
- Take off.
I'm gonna be here a long time.
I like my comfort now and then.
You've enough for a hotel.
How far do the men have to lug this stuff?
The other side of that little hill up there.
I'll hide this stuff there till I'm ready to move on.
It'll take them hours to get up there.
What am I to do?
Wait here like a sitting duck?
Who's gonna know?
You're tucked in here real nice and cozy.
The Japanese Navy never spotted you, did they?
- Where are you going?
- You have to stay on the ship, sir.
- There has to be an officer with the patrol.
- Why don't you let the kid go?
Give him a chance to stretch his legs and look at the countryside.
- Hanson, come-
- Thanks for the boat ride.
- I'll radio your regards to Capt. McClung.
- Thanks.
- I'll bring them back safe and sound.
- You better, or don't come back yourself.
On the bow.
- How do my men find their way back here?
- No problem.
Those masts of yours stick up like a lighthouse in the fog.
Good on you, mate.
You.
Get out of here with those whites.
They'll spot you for two miles.
Come on.
Must have jumped him without his knowing.
- I'll have the boys dig a-
- Leave him.
Leave everything just where it is.
I can't have them know I'm here.
He had no family that I know of, Chief.
Quicker I'm out of this, the better I'll like it.
Let's go.
- A little different up here.
- It's beautiful.
- It's hard to believe.
- Your first stiff, kid?
- Yeah.
- There'll be a lot more of them.
No cup of tea, this war.
Chief...
Goroka will show you where to dig my stuff in.
You'll have no trouble finding your way back.
You've left a trail as wide as George Street, Sydney.
- Will it give you away?
- No, it grows over in a day.
By tonight, we'll be a long way from here.
You're gonna stay down there in the jungle?
Till the Japs get me.
Or our blokes come down and run them out of here.
Don't worry about it.
Just reckon I'm crazy enough to get a kick out of it.
That don't mean I wanna stay here for ever.
You do your best to keep the Navy moving.
Goroka, we go along now.
- Stay awake.
- I'm awake.
Give me some air, will you?
Coffee, skipper?
Shark Bait... secure that boom crutch.
I want to move fast when they get back.
Yes, sir.
The crew will finish up.
There's nothing left but pulling some brush over.
We'll be ready by the time you cool off.
You went to the wrong school, sir.
- Officers ain't supposed to work so hard.
- I needed it.
Chief, come here.
That's it, the Japanese convoy.
Lucky we got the old man up here when we did.
He's still down in the jungle.
He can't possibly see it.
We've got to get back to the ship.
- All right, guys. Let's haul it.
- Come on, let's go.
Get going.
Sir, so the war lasts five minutes longer.
It'll be dark in an hour.
- Can I help you?
- I'm all right.
Sir, I saw the mast. They're right below us.
Go ahead.
Last time I ran like this, four MPs were on my tail.
Rip! Listen up!
Wait a minute.
- Rip?
- Yeah, come in, kid.
We saw the convoy. It was...
Let him talk. Makes no difference now.
Tommy, I'd like you to meet
Capt. Shigetsu. UCLA, '38.
Bachelor of Science in Horticulture.
So, you saw our convoy?
Move over there where I can watch you.
- Not now, kid.
- No, later.
As you were saying, you saw our convoy.
Where were you and what were you doing when you saw it?
My name is Thomas Hanson,
Ensign, United States Naval Reserve.
No use.
The good captain was just reminding me... that Japan is not a signatory of the Geneva Convention.
It really makes no difference.
We can classify you as a spy.
This is an aerial photograph... taken of this ship in the Solomon Sea yesterday.
You certainly weren't in uniform then.
Shall we get back to details of the missi髇?
Let's get back to the Rose Bowl game.
Okay, but Maj. Samada's gonna ask you the same questions.
- Very educated man, the Major.
- Really? I'm Stanford myself.
In that case, it'll be my pleasure to assist the Major in his questioning.
He's a big one.
I thought they were all little jokers.
Shut up.
What happened to you clowns? Asleep?
They were on us like tents.
We didn't have a chance.
It's for me. I'll get it.
Real brass.
Lay you eight-to-five he braces the sergeant.
- You'll rise when the Major enters.
- Sure, we will.
- You better.
- Okay.
Do me a favor.
It's there, right there. That's it.
I don't think they'd look good here with the Major coming down.
Thank you.
Close the door.
I won't tell you anything more!
Good boy. Get the guns.
Get below. Prime that engine.
Give me back full when I yell.
- You want these?
- There are too many.
- What're you gonna do?
- Like I know! Get on the engine.
Chief, look aft.
Sarge.
Didn't I meet you in Singapore once?
I remember, you used to hang out at that high-kickers club... in Saigon, huh?
Duck!
Go, Tommy! Give it full, and get up here on this machine gun!
Sparks, on the engine.
Chief, drop the centerboard.
Give me full ahead.
Duck!
See if you can get that machine gun nest.
Hang on to that gun, kid. Here we go.
You could've bet me we wouldn't make it.
Sorry, sir.
The engine flooded out going over the reef.
- Who needs it? Stand by to make sail.
- Aye, aye, sir!
Get this overboard so we can raise the mainsail.
Port Moresby trying to reach us, sir.
Good. Get on that thing and tell him what you saw.
- I can't transfer without the engine, sir.
- Fix it.
Look out, Rip!
Don't shoot.
Keep going.
- Rip, you all right?
- Are you kidding? I can't...
Move. Just make one little move.
Johnson, get the aid kit.
Let him handle it, sir.
- I can transmit now, sir.
- We'll contact them.
- lf you do, you kill your captain-
- Shut up, you crumb.
What do you mean?
You're still within range of the shore battery.
The second you start transmitting, they'll blow you out of the water.
Surrender. Your captain will be hospitalized.
- We have excellent Japanese doctors.
- Sir.
- Send it.
- It's insane.
You'll all be killed.
Can you stand by and let them destroy you?
- Let me plug him, sir.
- Shut up.
Enemy convoy seen north of Cape Gloucester.
What's the matter with you, you got four thumbs?
I told you so.
At 1600, heading west.
- Break out the life raft, Chief.
- Yes, sir.
Message received, sir.
Get that life raft over the side!
- How's he doing?
- I'm okay. Let's get out of here.
We're hit in the forward hull.
We're taking water fast.
- You abandon ship.
- Abandon ship!
Come on.
Aren't you gonna stay and die for the rising sun?
You out of your mind?
He's got a pretty high fever, sir.
Can still fire flares.
Japanese nurses very good.
One more crack out of you and you're in the water.
Sir, I hear a plane.
There it is!
It's a PBY.
Looks like UCLA blew another one.
On this same morning of 3 March... projecting the course of the enemy convoy from the slim information received... the Allied forces in New Guinea put every available aircraft in the air... met the Japanese ships and their air cover in the straits... between New Guinea and New Britain... and in a two-day running battle, wreaked total destruction on it.
Of this little-known, yet highly decisive battle...
Gen. Douglas MacArthur said:
"The battle of the Bismarck Sea won a victory of such completeness...
"as to assume the proportions of a major disaster to the enemy. "
And so it is recorded in the history of Worid War II.
Of considerably less importance... yet of vital interest to us... is the fact that six months later... in what was now just a quiet backwater in the rear area... a newly promoted Lt. J. G. pulled alongside his first command... and prepared to take over.
Belay that racket.
You want the whole area to hear us?
As a matter of fact, sir, yes.
- Stations for getting underway.
- Weigh her to side!
What did you say about going ashore and speaking to the Admiral?
You weren't interested in any more special missions.
I can let the man talk, can't l?
And in the remote outer reaches of the universe,
past civilization as we know it,
is a galactic system called, the Milky Way.
Now this minor galaxy contains in its backwards area a rather piddling star known as: The Sun.
With a really pitiful array of planets.
So much for our lesson in space geography.
And I hope you all took notes.
They'll be a test first thing in the century, now then...
Where is he?
Well, speak up. Where is Kreton?
During recess, I saw him kick the ball over Cloud 9.
On purpose.
Oh, but he said he'd be right back Mr.
Delton.
Yes, he better be.
I wonder if he's headed...
There again! Oh, no.
That's Kreton, alright.
Goofiest driver in the whole school.
Kreton.
Uh-uh, mustn't touch.
Let's go buster, back here where you belong.
- It's him.
- It's he.
Alright young man, I know you're there, come out.
Why don't you come in?
Because I'm the teacher and I said, come out.
Well, I didn't mean any harm, Mr. Delton.
You see, Mr. Delton? I found my ball.
- Oh, I'll get it.
- Oh, no you don't.
Young man, you and I are going to have a little heart to heart talk.
Back to your seats all of you.
Not you.
Now then... you know perfectly well you've been forbidden to visit, that odious little planetoid in the solar system.
But Mr. Delton, the Earth isn't a planetoid, it's a full grown planet, it has six continents, five oceans, 2 moons...
- One moon.
- One moon?
Well, anyhow, it's my hobby.
See, and well, as I calculate it, right now down there, they're having a very interesting period: The Civil War.
Well gee whiz, Mr. Dalton.
Every guy should have a hobby.
Not in your case.
Remember Mars, your last hobby?
We should have never let you set foot on the place.
Bare, barren, desolate.
Nobody goes there anymore.
No...
Say, maybe if they put in gambling you know...
Nothing would help.
Thanks to your thoughtlessness,
Mars is a dead planet.
What good is it?
Well, you could...
Now Kreton, I want you to write:
"I will not visit the earth",
10 billion times.
Stay after school a bit, if necessary.
But Mr. Delton, I got a date with the fellas, to go space skiing.
I got wax on my feet and everything.
10 billion times.
10 billion.
Well.
Did he say 10 billion times, or 10 million times?
What's the difference I'll start with the first time.
I... will... not... visit... the...
He's gone again. Boy, is he in for it.
You mean, "is the Earth in for it."
It is...
It is one of them.
It is. It is.
Hello Mr. Mayberry.
I just picked up my costume for your party tonight.
What are you going as?
General Lee, same as every year.
What are you looking at?
A flying saucer.
A what?
Didn't you see it?
Well, no sir.
This is the real thing, Conrad.
Look for yourself.
You see it? Do you see it?
Now, Mr. Mayberry, there ain't nothing up there except a little old cloud.
Oh, give me those.
Little old cloud nothing. There she is.
Going round and round and round.
- Let me have another look.
- Just as plain as day.
- Well?
- I'm looking.
What is your considered opinion, Conrad?
You won't get mad?
Well, of course I won't.
Well, Mr. Mayberry, my considered opinion is:
You oughta' see an eye doctor.
You got astigmatism.
Eye doctor!
Well, I gotta get over to Spelding's,
I gotta drop these flowers for Ellen.
Astigmatism!
To wear to your party tonight.
Bye-bye.
Oh, my goodness.
It's wiggling like a hula-hoop.
George, I fully realise that you are vice president in charge of programming but I will not pull my punches.
The American public has faith in Roger Putnam Spelding.
And I intend to expose this flying saucers scare, once and for all.
On my telecast tonight.
Hello, hello.
Rheba, will you please get off the telephone I'm talking to New York.
I'm sorry dear, I was calling the Mayberry's.
Do you think you he'll need more mint for the juleps?
Rheba please, I'm talking to George Abercrombie.
Really? Oh, hello George and goodbye.
Evening, Conrad.
Evening, Mrs. Spelding.
Not dressed yet for the party?
Plenty of time, Mrs. Spelding.
Oh, darling, there's some terrible force that just keeps driving me on and on and on.
Will you just restrain that terrible force because I'm getting prickly heat again.
Don't forget to dress for the party, Conrad.
Honey, let's get married right now.
Conrad, as you may have suspected,
I find you sexually attractive, but you just don't have any... money.
Well, I don't happen to believe in money.
Ellen, no marriage til we finish college and get our degree.
Oh I don't know, maybe marriage is all I'm fit for.
Breeding.
Out in the fields and an hour later back to the plow.
Carrying my newborn child on my back.
Ellen!
If you're going to talk that way, go where smart talk is appreciated.
Go to a bar or a bus station.
Sometimes I wonder if all that cod liver oil, wasn't a mistake.
Children were stuffed with it.
And now look at them.
I'd like a big family.
So would I.
Let's start right now.
- Conrad.
- We'll get married.
And then our weekend at the lake.
All I am saying George, is that it's high time the American public grew up.
How does it look dear?
George, I am not calling all of the American public, "boobs," only the boobs that believe this dribble.
I'll admit it's a bit daring but after all, Scarlet was, a hussy.
Rheba, for heaven's sake.
- Hurry, or we'll be late for the party.
- Shh.
Rhett...
I am going as Jefferson Davis.
Now that's final George.
My program goes on the air exactly as we taped it this morning.
Goodbye.
Censorship, the curse of the intelligent man.
And what are you doing?
He's just giving me a hand, daddy.
He certainly is. Get it out of there.
Her zipper stuck, Mr. Spelding.
No man has the right to zip a girl, until they're engaged.
Oh, I'm sure we can trust Conrad, he's very mechanical.
Mr. Spelding, what do you think about these UFO reports?
Poppycock.
Mr. Mayberry doesn't think so.
He swears he saw an unidentified flying object, heading towards Richmond a little while ago.
Bob Mayberry saw the Richmond plane heading towards Richmond.
Mass hysteria that's what it is.
I am laying it on the line tonight for the American public.
You could be wrong, dear.
Space men. There ain't no such animal.
That's the phrase I'm hitting them with on my telecast.
Remember that scoop you had about Elvis.
You said he was going into the Navy.
Why don't you go home and get dressed?
Yes, sir. Ouch!
I'll be back soon Ellen.
All right dear.
Some mechanic.
Flying saucer over Richmond.
Now I've heard everything.
There ain't no such animal.
Safe.
Good evening, I wonder if you could help me?
Am I any where near eh...
Oh, I guess he hasn't learned to read yet.
What's the matter Rags? Hungry?
Rheba, when are you going to feed this dog?
I think he's trying to tell you something.
Of course he is, he's trying to tell me he's hungry.
You see, he's not hungry at all.
- Now, where he ever learn that trick?
- I don't know.
Someone at the side door. I'll get it dear.
Rheba, it's almost seven do you mind turning on the TV set in the living room.
Of course, dear. Any particular channel?
My channel.
I want to watch me. Nobody else in this house does.
- Yes?
- Good evening, madam.
My name Kreton, and my respects to General Lee.
I should like to see him instantly.
General Lee? Oh, you mean Bob
Mayberry down the road.
That's where the party is.
But I'm here for the battle.
Oh, I don't think it will be a brawl, although last year...
We will be leaving in a few minutes.
Why don't you just drive over with us, Mr. Crouton?
Uh, that's Kreton. And thank you very much.
TVset warmed up yet?
Just turning it on, dear.
My husband's television program.
He's very popular they tell me.
Oh, really?
- Oh, Mr. Kreton?
- Yes?
Do sit down and watch.
Well, television in 1361 .
That's funny, I thought it came much later.
- Smoke if you'd like to.
- Thank you.
And stop whatever you’re doing.
Yes, stop and reflect a moment.
Are you a thinking man?
Yeah, I think, I'm a thinking man.
Why not review your smoking habits.
Wait, I'm busy thinking.
Do it now.
Yes, sir.
But first... relax.
Get comfortable.
You mind if I sit down?
Sit down.
Thank you, you're very kind.
Now then, before you light up...
Oh, I'm sorry.
Inspect the filter at the end of your smoke.
Look inside... look closely.
What do you see?
Tobacco, what would you see?
Inspect the tobacco.
Try a crumble test.
A crumble test?
Rub the tobacco between your hands.
Now, whiff it.
Wait, I'm still busy crumbling.
Whiff it!
Oh, yes sir.
Does it have that fresh deep down aroma?
Makes you stop and think, doesn't it..
It made me stop and sneeze.
So men just throw that old smoke of yours away.
And try one of these.
Put it between your lips.
Close your eyes.
Now... light up.
Yes... light up... and live.
Light up and live?
Man. I'm going to be burned to death.
You damn Yankee.
His name is Kreton.
Why can't he walk over there?
Who is he anyway?
Some friend of the Mayberry's.
A nice young man.
Oh, confound it. I'm missing me.
This dog has gone nuts. Now scoot, jump.
For several years now certain lunatics elements,
have proclaimed the existence of flying saucers.
I should like to nail the subject down once and for all.
There ain't no such animal.
There is no life on other planets capable of building spaceships
and to interject a purely American note,
no country in the world but ours,
has the industrial know how to build such a ship.
Right.
Let me show you some recent photographs
of objects purported to be spaceships.
- Why, president Jefferson Davis.
- Number one.
Of all people, I can't tell you how glad I am to meet you...
Oh, I'm awfully sorry, sir.
For what?
Number two.
Your left side-burn sir...
They, shot it off.
Number three.
- Quiet.
- I'm sorry?
I'm trying to listen.
Oh. I'll listen also sir.
And number four.
Optical illusions, every one of them.
Mass hysteria.
That's telling them, eh, boy.
Yes, sir. It's too bad, is full of hooey.
Hooey?
Oh well, I believe that's the expression, sir..
Or is it eh, goofidust?
No, hooey! That's it. He is full of hooey.
There's no need for alarm. No need at all.
We shall return to Roger
Putnam Spelding, in a moment.
But first. Have you inspected your filter lately.
Smoke Supurbo.
Superb tobacco superbly blended
a superb filter.
Mr. President, don't you listen to him.
He'll burn your whiskers off.
Oh, stop.
I mean it, sir. He did a job on me.
He burned my head and my face...
You think I'm full of hooey, eh?
Oh, no sir. I didn't say you were full of hooey,
I said that... that... that...
Well... your not Jefferson Davis.
Your him that man on TV.
- That Roger Pelman Sputing.
- Spelding.
I know who I am. The question is: Who are you?
Oh, no sir. The question is: When am I?
When are you?
What I mean is... what year is this?
I'm 99 years off.
What year did you have in mind?
1861 . You see, I was on my way to the Civil War and something went wrong with the machine, or my calculations, I don't know which, but...
I landed here 99 years out of my way.
But I never was very good at dates.
Are you trying to pull my leg?
No, sir, but if you'd like me to...
Oh, I've been awfully rude, sir,
I haven't introduced myself.
My name is Kreton.
I'm from the other side.
The other side of where?
The other side of the universe, another planet.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Actually, what...
Come on, come on, I know a trick when I see one.
Now where's the wire that you did this with?
What is this?
I'm sorry, I neglected to warn you.
You see,
I can touch you but you mustn't touch me, you understand?
Look, I'll show you.
You see?
They do exist and you're one of them.
Well, you... you come from out there.
That's it, yes indeed.
But that's our little secret now, isn't it Mr. Spelding?
That's odd. I thought
I turned that motor off.
Oh, I'll be spending the night here.
That is... if it's convenient.
I'll be right back.
When you boobs my friends, I simply repeat:
When it comes to visitors from outer space,
there ain't no such animal.
That's what you think, you stupid boob.
Oh, Mr. Delton, sir.
You playing hookey too?
I certainly am not.
So you've gone over the cloud again eh?
What's your excuse this time?
Another missing volleyball?
Oh, no sir. No, Mr. Delton.
I-I lost my marbles.
You lost your marbles long ago.
Well, I'll tell the truth, Mr. Delton.
You see the reason I played hookie and came down here is, because well, I like the Earth and I like the people on it, and well sir, can't I study them?
Absolutely not.
But it would be like homework, sir, after all I am majoring in the planet Earth.
Under no circumstances.
On second thought, maybe you ought to get this out of your system.
It might do you a world of good.
Another world that is.
You mean I can stay then, sir?
For a bit.
But remember Kreton, there's a wise old proverb that goes
"up is down and down is up..."
"And never the twain shall meet."
Yes, I remember it.
I remember it well, sir.
But you must keep in mind that this visit of yours, must be a secret.
And don't get involved with these
Earth people. You can't trust them.
No, you can't trust them at all, sir, except Mr. Spelding, he's very nice, an he wouldn't tell a soul about me.
He wouldn't, eh?
At this very moment, he's calling New York. Listen.
I don't care if he is having dinner.
This is important.
I'll fix his wagon.
What are you going to do, Mr. Delton?
That joker is getting the old "86."
Oh no don't disintegrate, him Mr.
Delton, please.
He's a very nice man, and he's going to a party later and his wife won't have anyone to dance with.
Couldn't you just throw an old 14 at him?
- 14 it is.
- Your very kind.
Here's how I start my program tomorrow...
Well, speak up man. I have a dinner party waiting for me.
How do you intend to start your broadcast?
Mary had a wittle wamb, its fleece was white as snow, and everywhere that Mary went.
Roger, are you out of your mind?
The wamb... was sure... to go.
Spelding you're drunk.
Study these Earthlings but don't get involved.
No, I won't.
Do you worry, Mr. Delton and thank you very much.
And I'll be a good boy, Mr. Delton.
Have a good trip.
So long.
What happened?
Well, you were snitching so you got a 14.
You could have gotten an 36.
What's an 86?
Come, I'll show you.
Well?
Watch that plant.
That's an 86.
You'll like him, he's really a very nice young man.
- Mr. Kreton.
- Yes?
This is my daughter, Ellen.
Hello.
Huh. 36.
That's better... much better.
Pardon?
- I mean... this bend...
- What?
What I mean to say is that, it does something for girls.
You see, where I come from, the girls are 36 straight and that's it.
But this, breaks up the monotony.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- He is cute, mother.
I was right.
I was right. I was right.
Good evening, Ellen, Rheba.
I just received a flash from headquarters on the flying saucers.
It's confirmed Roger.
Why I even saw one with my own eyes, as plain as day.
There were machine guns sticking out of the side and underneath it had a rack of bombs, and a tremendous cannon poking out of a pillbox on the top.
Oh, ho ho?
- How do you do.
- How do you do.
Have we met?
No, unless you've ever been to X-47.
This is Mr. Mayberry. He's host to the party tonight.
Oh?
Nice costume.
Right costume, wrong century.
Oh, get this, Rog, get this.
At 1300 this evening, an unidentified flying object was spotted high over...
Bob, you shouldn't read that in front of Roger.
Remember, there "ain't" no such animal.
"No such animal," as what, mother?
As visitors from beyond.
Teensy-winsy little men with long green feelers like this.
Excuse me, Mrs. Spelding, but the long green feelers went out with the short red tails.
Short red tails??
Bob, Rheba, for heaven's sake.
Short red tails!
That's a good one.
No.
Oh no.
Yes, yes indeed. You put fingerprints all over it.
I mean, I don't care for me personally, but we are supposed to keep it clean.
You know, sloppy barrier, sloppy mind.
You know what's going on Rog, tell us?
I can't. I have to watch out for that old 86.
Look what happened to the azalea plant.
It's withered!
That's what I mean.
Can I tell them, please?
Well, as long as I am going to be a guest in your house,
I suppose it'll be alright.
But remember now.
This is our little secret.
- You see...
- I'm from another world.
- From another...?
- Planet.
- It's true.
- Jupiter?
Jupiter? No one lives on Jupiter.
Well, at least no one I know.
Why did you come here?
Oh... I guess it was a combined pleasure and study trip.
You know, a visit to your small planet from mine.
8,000,000 light years away.
3,000,000. Imagine.
Poor boy, you must be exhausted.
I am as a matter of fact a little pooped right now.
A good night sleep will take care of that.
I'll fix up the guest room.
Oh, well, thank you very much.
Hi everybody.
Hi, Conrad.
What is he supposed to be?
A spaceman.
At least that's what I would have said 10 minutes ago.
Ain't I something?
Excuse me, please.
How do you do?
I wonder, do you mind?
Go ahead.
Thank you.
You know I'm sick and tired of going to this old ball every year dressed as Stonewall Jackson.
This year I'm going as a sure enough spaceman.
Boom boom.
Oh, you don't need that to boom boom.
May I?
Sure.
Mr. Spelding, who is that?
That you boob, is a spaceman.
A spaceman?
You're kidding.
Will you please sit down and shut up?
Oh, I'm sorry Mr. Spelding.
Get this thing off me!
Get it off.
Yes, I will. Just a second.
Oops I'm sorry, Mr. Spelding. I guess I aimed just a little too high.
If you'll just take your hands down and relax.
Just hold perfectly still.
There we are.
See, Mr. Spelding, I can but you can't.
Sure enough ever loving cotton picking spaceman.
Here you are Mr. Spelding,
I hope that I didn't upset...
Guest room's ready.
Thank you, very much Mrs. Spelding.
I hope I didn't put you out.
And you'll find some of Mr. Spelding's clothes in the closet.
Feel free to wear them.
My clothes?!? Are you radioactive?
Oh, you needn't worry about that sir,
I've had my shots.
Well, enjoy yourselves everybody.
I'm going to beddy-bye.
- Goodnight.
- You forgot your bag, Kreton.
Oh, so I did, thank you. And thank you.
Bob...
Where are you going?
I know my duty when I see it.
I'm reporting this to state militia.
I wouldn't do that. He wants it kept secret.
Secret?
Oh. Of course. You can trust me, Rog.
Won't tell a soul.
Conrad?
I won't tell a soul either Mr. Spelding.
Your darned right you won't.
You think I'd let a blabber mouth like you get me in trouble?
You are not leaving this house tonight.
You are sleeping here.
In my room.
I'm sorry, Mr. Spelding, I just can't.
I mean... well, I'm not gonna leave
Myrtle alone in my place all night.
- Myrtle?
- His goat daddy. Remember?
Oh yeah...
Myrtle hasn't been a bit well Mr. Spelding.
She looks very piqued.
And in the last couple of days she's been running a temperature.
Well, she can run it over here.
Put Myrtle in our barn.
- Is it air conditioned?
- Get going.
Yes sir, I'll do that.
What about the party daddy?
We are not going to the party.
Good evening, good evening.
Mabel, Mabel. Get them to the living room.
- What?
- Get them into the living room, please.
Hurry, dear, hurry.
Will you all please go into the living room and enjoy yourself.
I'll be there in just a moment.
Have fun.
Robert, what in the world...?
Don't ask any questions, Mabel.
This is the biggest thing that ever happened to Manassas...
To the country!
Captain Jackson? Mayberry of Manassas.
Listen carefully, this is top, top secret.
At precisely 7:45 tonight...
Mary had a wittle wamb.
Mustn't do that, Mr. Mayberry.
Oh, hiya Rags. Come on in. Come on.
There's no reason why we can't be friends, Rags.
Now, whats on your mind?
Come on, out with it.
Oh, I forgot.
I don't believe it. There ain't no such human.
You been spending too much time with Mr. Spelding.
I am perfectly normal.
Rags, where do you sleep at night?
Me? In a lousy box on the back porch.
They think I'm a watchdog,
but I'm really not. I'm yellow.
So am I.
Rags I have a thought. Why don't you bunk here with me tonight?
- With you?
- Sure, why not?
Oh.
Rags, you take the lower.
Normal... he says.
- Good morning, Kreton.
- Oh, good morning, Ellen.
- You look very pretty this morning.
- Thank you.
Well, how do you like it?
Your first day on Earth, I mean.
Oh! Oh that.
Just wonderful. I like it a lot.
Except that, it's not exactly like I thought it would be.
Why, what did you imagine?
Well, I'm a little disappointed, you know,
I missed the Civil War and
Gettysburg, and Shiloh, and Manassas.
You keep talking about the past, are you from the future?
Yeah, uh-huh. I can visit you at any moment in your history.
You know, time is really a trapezoid.
You know what that means, don't you?
No, I'm afraid I don't.
You don't know what a trapezoid is?
Well, I don't either, actually.
That's the trouble with school, you see, they make you memorize things that your never ever gonna use.
Kreton, what's it like in space?
Oh, it's pretty nice. Especially if you're traveling out of season.
Uh oh.
- Uh oh, trouble.
- Trouble?
Your daddy's in the study, and he's waiting for a call from
George Abercrombie in New York, and is he worried...
You mean, you can tell what daddy's thinking?
Uh huh. Would you like to listen in?
George Abercrombie, big shot executive,
thinks he has brains. Well,
I've got news for him.
His brains aren't in his head they're in his...
Oops.
You have to be awfully careful of thoughts.
Like for instance: Your thoughts. Right now.
I haven't a thing on my mind.
Except Conrad.
The truth, Ellen?
Poor Conrad, sleeping with daddy,
and if daddy knew what he was planning for this weekend at the lake
he'd strangle him in his sleep.
No chaperones.
I'm frighted...
No, I'm excited.
I'm really looking forward to...
He's inside. Kreton's inside my mind.
Kreton, stop that!
Well, Ellen, wait a minute,
I mean, well, I didn't mean to embarrass you.
Well, now you know.
Oh, Kreton, the whole thing is so mixed up.
Well, lets un-mix it.
First, how does Conrad feel about your father?
I'm afraid he doesn't like Daddy very much.
And what does your father think about Conrad?
Despises him.
Well, then the first thing we have to do is, change the sleeping arrangement.
Because last night certainly wasn't satisfactory at all.
Now, there are 3 bedrooms and I'm in one.
Now, let's put Mr. and Mrs. Spelding in bedroom A, together.
Now, you and Conrad...
Yes, this is going to work out just fine, Ellen.
You and Conrad can take over bedroom B.
But, Conrad and I, aren't married.
Well, I didn't mean any harm by it, Ellen.
You have to understand that, well, you see, where I come from, we don't tangle.
You don't tangle?
Oh no, we haven't done that for a long time.
Well, if you don't tangle...
What do you do?
I mean, how do you multiply?
Multiply what?
Each other. How do you have babies?
- Oh we don't.
- I don't understand.
Well, let me explain, Ellen.
You see, we have ourselves.
And, well, since we're for real, forever.
Well, there's enough of us.
Do you understand?
So now you... never tangle.
No, never. It's a lost art.
Although I must admit we were a little hasty. I think.
But, anyway, you must promise me that you'll let me watch, the next time you and
Conrad oscillate antennas.
Oscillate antennas?
Oh, I'm sorry. Well, that's what they call it on Venus, but down here I believe they refer to it as " pitch and woo."
May I watch?
Well, Ellen, what did I say now?
That's really the one thing
I wanna see while I'm down here.
Kreton, you've got to stop talking like that.
I know that you're from another planet and all,
I guess we do think an awful lot about sex down here.
But we're not supposed to discuss it.
Anyway, it only happens when nobody's looking.
Morning, Conrad.
Did you sleep well?
I was up all night...
Ell...
Ellen, your father grinds his teeth.
It's just gruesome.
He's been listening to my mind.
Huh?
I know all about the weekend at the lake.
No chaperone.
Yeah, how 'bout that?
How'd he find out?
I just told you. I was thinking about you, and Kreton saw it in my mind.
Guess who I'm thinking about right this minute peach blossom.
So that's how you Earthlings do it, huh?
Very interesting. Very interesting, indeed.
Well, I'm pretty well straightened away except for one little detail.
A teensy-winsy thing
I'm still not too sure of.
- Which one has the baby?
- Kreton!
Conrad, go get the car, we'll be late for class.
Ahh, in a minute.
I got to go out to the barn and give Myrtle her breakfast.
I'll take her a corn flakes box.
I'll pick you up in a few minutes honey child.
Corn flake box?
This seems much more nourishing.
I do believe he thinks more of that goat than he does of me.
What a weekend.
I can just see her gorgeous figure in that bathing suit.
Wow-wee!
Well, you're the one alright.
Nobody ever whistled at a goat in a bathing suit.
Except another goat I guess.
Oh, there you are.
If you're not busy, Mr. Kreton, my husband would see you in the study.
Oh, gladly.
What are you laughing at dear?
Conrad's goat in a bathing suit.
Oh? Did he buy her a bathing suit?
I didn't know she could swim.
Why don't you hang a red light on that thing, it's a menace to navigation.
- Good morning, my boy.
- Good morning, sir.
I need your advice.
I just spoke to New York...
I know. You spoke to George Abercrombie, and he's on his way here, he's arriving on the 11 o'clock plane.
How did you...? Oh...
You know what I'm thinking.
Uh huh, and right now you're pretty worried, aren't you?
Of course I'm worried.
That fellow's my boss.
Hires and fires, fires and hires, all day long.
Why did I do that? I never drink before breakfast.
A drink what? What is that?
- Bourbon.
- Bourbon? May I try?
I'm afraid you're a little young my boy.
Young? Here's my driver's license. See?
I'm over 21 .
21 million light years?
Yes, you should have seen my birthday cake with all the candles.
Burned it to a crisp.
I'd be careful... on an empty stomach.
Really? Then should be a lotta fun.
Mr. Delton, are you gonna' let him try that stuff?
I am indeed. It'll teach him a lesson.
Give that lad enough cloud and he'll hang himself.
Good, good.
Wow, that sure was powerful stuff.
Thank you very much.
Now, now, you can talk later.
Time for breakfast.
Ellen and Conrad want to drive
Mr. Kreton into town with them.
Do you like your bacon crisp Mr. Kreton?
Yes, that'll be fine.
Good. You shouldn't be up there, you know.
You'll get footprints all over the ceiling.
Oh, by the way, you can make my eggs, sunny side down.
Now that's silly.
Now I know what they mean by "being high".
Let's have another one.
Well, I'm beginning to understand how they do things here on Earth.
When Conrad tickles your ear, that makes the motor go, right?
Conrad, tickling my ear, has nothing to do with the motor.
It has to do with your motor?
You oughta try it sometime.
Love... it's wonderful.
Oh, well, we gave up ages ago.
It took us darn near forever to stamp out disease.
Scarlet fever, mumps, anxiety, the common cold and finally, that great killer: Passion.
You gave up passion?
Oh yeah, we don't feel anything.
We don't do anything.
Inside we're sort of like... cold spaghetti, you know?
- Sounds terribly dull.
- Well, it is, a little.
You go right ahead, Conrad.
Don't mind me.
Oh, I'm sorry, I was watching.
Unless we get moving soon we're going to be late.
Kreton, you did that. How'd you ever do it?
Very simple. I just thought him into the air.
The next policeman is yours.
- Oh, may I?
- Sure!
- Hey, this is fun.
- Oh, it sure is.
- Oh, is this is one mine?
- Be my guest.
- Oh no.
- What do I do?
Well, just focus all your thoughts on that policeman.
- Ellen, please.
- Conrad, watch this.
Nothing happened.
That's because you're not concentrating, Ellen.
Now, concentrate. Lift the cop.
Lift the cop.
Conrad! I did it! He moved!
He really moved!
That was wonderful, Ellen.
Tomorrow I'll teach you to lift buildings.
Isn't this fun?
Hey!
Would you kindly stop flirting with my girl?
Well, I didn't mean any harm, Conrad.
Inside, cold spaghetti, remember?
Cold spaghetti nothing.
You got a hot chile look in your eye!
Look, look, here he comes.
You'll probably wind up in jail.
Oh, we can't do that. It would spoil our whole day.
Uh, watch him. I'll give him an 8 the easy way.
You know your way back home, don't you fella?
Well, I found my way to the Earth didn't I?
That's a lot easier than finding your way out of a turnpike.
Oh.
Well... thanks for the car, Conrad.
I'll be careful.
These turnpikes are murder. Ain't they bud?
Oh, they're not so bad, just follow me.
Flash! Ladies and gentlemen,
the most remarkable event in the history of Virginia
has just occurred in Manassas.
At exactly 9:37 am,
at the Richmond interchange...
Mary had a wittle wamb.
Its fleece was white as snow
and everywhere that Mary went
the wamb was sure to go.
Hi Clementine.
Oh, hi honey. Well, how are you?
Now what's this all about?
Everyday the same old routine.
And I'm getting pretty tired of it.
Here he comes, the terror of Manassas.
Here, here now neighbors should be friends.
Now, I want you two to shake hands.
I positively refuse!
Right in the eye. You call her a lady?
Alright now stop this bickering and I'm not leaving here until you two kiss and make up.
I won't kiss him but he can kiss me.
There, now that wasn't so terrible was it?
Dames, she really loves it.
Mrs. Spelding...
Shh! I'm eavesdropping.
Roger's been in there listening to Mr Abercrombie for almost an hour.
I don't like that Ambercrombie.
I'm sure Roger's going to lose his job.
Don't you worry about that Mrs Spelding.
We're fraternity brothers!
You've made a few mistakes too many old man.
George, if you're saying...
I'm saying that viewer wise, sponsor wise, information wise.
You, Spelding, are low man on the totem pole.
The flag is down the lifeboats are gone and the ship is sinking.
- And I'm the captain?
- But not for long.
You're going down for the third time.
Who's this joker?
Kreton? Oh, he's a visitor here.
Last night about 7 o'clock
Mary had a wittle wamb its fleece was white as...
Spelding! Are you in your second childhood?
Yes sir, there's no other explanation.
Abercrombie, I've been looking forward to meeting you for a long time.
You've always been A-1 on my ship ever since the lifeboat went up the totem pole.
I beg your pardon?
What I mean to say man is you're the talk of Madison Avenue.
Oh? Oh well... aren't you exaggerating a trifle?
Not a bit. How about that humdinger of a deal you pulled on.
BB. DD. JJ. And W, huh?
You really gave them the old stabbed in the back. Knife wise.
I really pulled a fast one there didn't I.
Wait a minute.
Nobody knew about the BB, DD,
JJ, and W deal, not even W.
How did you find out?
Well don't tell me. From my wife.
No! Eloise.
Shh! Nobody knows about Eloise.
Not even your wife.
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure.
He's sure.
Oh, good good.
You see when a man has a wife like mine and Eloise, like Eloise.
Well, he can get in an awful mess.
Would you pardon me, I want to get some more ice.
Sure.
What's he thinking about?
Am I going to lose my job?
Very important to get rid of Spelding.
I'm sunk.
Oh no you're not.
Oh, eh, Spelding.
I suggest we let this simmer in the pot for a while.
And about that BB, DD, JJ, and W business.
And... Eloise.
This is strictly "entre nous" of course.
Oh, of course.
I won't say a word.
No, not as long as you still have your job eh, Mr Spelding.
Oh I get it, blackmail!
It's not bad... blackmail.
No, I use it all the time myself.
You've got quite a future in the advertising game young man.
Cheerio.
- Goodbye George.
- Oh, goodbye Rheba.
Remember me to your charming wife.
Oh, yes of course.
Thanks, my boy. You saved my neck.
Well, I don't like him.
How'd everything go dear?
Fine, just fine, thanks to our young friend here.
He really straightened old George out.
Glad to have been of service, sir.
Aah. What a great son-in-law he'd make.
- You mean instead of Conrad?
- I certainly do.
Well, I don't know... Sputniks, for grandchildren but I don't think parents should interfere, mine didn't or I wouldn't be Mrs.
Roger Putnam-Spelding, would I dear?
Conrad, you know what I think we oughta do tonight?
- Get married?
- No, silly.
I think we should take
Kreton to the "Hungry Brain."
- He might enjoy it.
- I wouldn't enjoy it.
Not with him.
- You're jealous.
- I can't help it.
Baby doll, marry me.
Darling, I can't. Daddy would be furious.
If your daddy thought it would get me out of his bedroom tonight he'd forge the wedding license.
Darling, I just can't marry you.
You're sweet, but maybe what I really want, what I really need, is someone who'd drag me around be the hair.
Oh, you started. Good.
Oh don't mind me,
I won't make a sound.
I'll just sit back here and take notes.
You go right ahead.
Kreton, we went all through that this morning.
It's not polite to snoop on people.
That's right mister.
Well, I didn't mean any harm. I'm sorry.
Kreton, Conrad and I have decided to take you out tonight.
You decided..
We decided.
No we didn't.
Yes we did!
Well, I'm not going!
Then we'll go alone!
Mister, I don't approve of my girl going out with strange men.
Kreton is not strange!
They don't come any stranger!
Kreton, you and I are going to The Hungry Brain tonight.
Oh wonderful!
What is it?
Well, it's our favorite rendezvous.
And it's out of this world.
Out of this world? I'd better dress for it.
Well, here we are.
On the moon?
On the moon! No.
No Ellen, The Hungry Brain.
Come on dear.
What's the matter Ellen, you're trembling. Did I drive too fast for you?
No, it's just that I never cross the river before without using the bridge.
Kreton, don't you know what bridges are for?
Yeah, to shade the fish.
Mr. Mayberry.
Thank you!
Let's go.
Man, now that's out.
That's so out, he ain't ever been in.
Well, real old fashioned music.
I think this is going to be fun.
- Good evening, Miss. Spelding.
- Good evening.
Right this way, please.
This cat must be our new leader.
Well, if he ain't, let's elect him.
Crazy. He's a real kook.
Hey kook!
Like uh... who's the new member?
I don't know baby but he sure looks cool.
Welcome to inner space brother.
Oh, thank you.
Say, that's a real crazy looking pair of jeans you have dad.
Who laid the threads on you?
Jeans? Threads?
Like who's your tailor, baby, and where can we find him?
Oh, my tailor. Well, do you know where the Milky Way is?
Yeah the...
The Milky Way.
Yeah, yeah the Milky Way. Go baby wail.
Well, you turn right at the second nebula and it's the third planet at the end of the star cluster.
You just ask for Mr. De Milo and tell him I sent ya'.
Man this cat talks off the top.
He's tuned in.
Tell me double hipness.
What floor do you get out of when you split from the cloud.
Oh, we don't use floors.
You don't use floors?
Oh no, we use fog.
It's much softer and far easier to keep clean.
Quite a group aren't they?
Oh yes they are.
Except I'm a little curious
Ellen, tell me one thing...
What are they: Animal, mineral or vegetable?
There people silly. Beatniks.
Man, what we're trying to find out is, where you planted here or did you come in on the beam?
He wants to know where you come from?
Perhaps you'd rather not tell.
Oh no, I don't mind. I'm sure they won't say anything.
Oh I'm sorry.
I come from X-47.
I live right near that tailor I told you about.
Out past the Milky Way.
Out... past... The Milky Way.
Past.
Oh man, this cat's really from out of town.
Alright boys take five.
Hey man, we've been watching you from the bandstand.
Oh really?
Yeah, you look out enough to make it.
Would you dig wailing with the group?
Oh well, thank you, but I'm not a musician.
Although, I think
I would like to play those.
- The skins?
- Skins?
The bongos man!
Oh yeah, the bongos, yeah.
Crazy, let's make it.
Like now let's split.
Well, if it's all the same to you,
I think I'd like to play them from here.
You want to play those... from there?
Yeah.
Kreton, how did you do that?
Oh, uh...
Well, it's quite simple, see, many, many different...
This is a very sad story.
You see, it's all about a girl who fell in love with a no good rat nick, and it's very touching actually.
Cuckoo!
A little kids a drop deserted her.
Oh my god. Why?
Cuckoo!
Oh, I'll be alright.
It was a lovely number. Too bad she left out the best part.
What part did she leave out?
The part... where her father makes it like he... he doesn't know he did...
Kreton, now come on.
I get all chocked up when I hear...
Do you mind if I borrow your man?
No, I won't.
Life's a drag daddy-o.
Let's make it.
Oh, well, thank you, but I'm with her.
No daddy-o, you're with "it".
Come on, honey.
Buzz over to my "hive".
Just watch my hand closely.
Nooo, you're watching too hard.
- Just cool it, man, cool it.
- Cool it.
Yeah.
- There we go.
- Crazy.
Mr. Delton should see me now.
I can young man. I see you very well.
Kreton, you were just wonderful.
Oh, it wasn't anything.
You know, sometimes you do things and you're not really aware of what’s going on because your just doing...
Ellen, what are you doing under the table?
- I've had it!
- This is ridiculous.
Shave my beard and call me normal!
Let's go!
Oh I didn't mean it!
Don't be scared!
I didn't...
Wait a minute. I...
Kreton, will you come down from there?
I'm sorry, Ellen, I guess Mr. Delton saw more than I figured.
Say, what are those cars doing over there?
That's inspiration point.
Don't they have a lover's Lane where you come from?
Oh no. We gave that up a long time ago.
Along with mahjong and community singing.
Would you like to go over and... park for a while?
Yeah, that might be interesting.
Hey, kill the lights!
Turn them off!
Turn those lights down!
Turn those lights down!
Turn off those lights.
It seems pretty dull to me.
They're just sitting there and they're not even talking.
The reason they're not talking is because they're cuddling.
Look at that gorgeous moon.
Doesn't the moon mean anything to you?
Of course.
Last stop for gas before Mars.
The moon Kreton, spells romance.
That boy and that girl they're kissing.
The moon did that.
Well now?
Is kissing really fun?
Why don't you try it and find out?
That's a splendid idea.
I'll run over and ask them.
Kreton, there's no need to make such a long trip.
Stay here.
I believe I will try it.
It is sanitary but it isn't as much fun.
I'd better get rid of that old barrier.
Oh, I like that.
You know something?
We're going to do that again.
That's what he thinks.
Kreton this will never do, there isn't any "oomph".
On the contrary, I felt a definite ping in my left vertebrae.
Let's have another whirl at it.
Great.
- Oh boy.
- Another ping?
And a pong and a wing ding dong.
I melted it. I melted it.
It's the real thing.
I'm in love.
Exactly as I anticipated.
- He's become an Earthling.
- Oh, what a wonderful feeling, Ellen.
He asked for it and I'm afraid he's going to get it.
- What was that?
- I must have blown a fuse.
- Ellen, do you know why...?
- It's all my fault.
I should never have let you kiss me.
Well, Ellen, don't worry, I-I'm gonna do the right thing.
I'm gonna ask your father, for your hand in marriage.
Marriage?
For my hand in...?
Kreton, do you realize what you're saying?
Well of course I realize, Ellen.
And all the time you thought was a cad.
Well, coming up?
No, I think I'll go get some hot milk, or cold milk or something.
I'll see you in the morning, Kreton.
Happy, Ellen?
Well, not exactly happy. I'm more...
More ecstatic. Yeah, me too.
I'm floating on air.
I heard that outer-space carpetbagger.
You're not going to marry him.
- Are you?
- Of course not, darling.
I just don't want to hurt his feelings.
What about my feelings. I'm human, too.
What do I mean "too", he's not human.
Lord knows what he is.
Well, whatever he is, Kreton is kind and sweet and nice.
Oh Conrad, what am I going to do?
You're gonna marry me, that's what you're gonna do.
- We're going to elope.
- Oh, Conrad.
Just as soon as I finish this sandwich.
You know Rags? Ellen and I are really meant for each other.
It's really true love.
I know Ellen and I are from different worlds, but that shouldn't be an obstacle.
Personally, I don't believe in mixed marriages.
- Look at me.
- Why, you look just fine.
Fine? My mother was a Mexican chihuahua and my father, a Labrador retriever.
How'd you like to walk around with a warm nose and a cold tail.
Oh Rags, goodnight.
That poor earthling, Conrad.
He thinks he's going to elope with Ellen.
But I know better.
That's what he thinks.
And you know what's funny, Rags?
Mr. Delton doesn't have the slightest idea about what's going on.
That's what he thinks.
Mr. Delton thinks that falling in love will get me into trouble.
That's what he thinks, boy is he wrong.
That's what he thinks.
Good morning, dear.
Young ones not down yet?
Kreton, Conrad, breakfast is ready.
- Where's Ellen?
- I don't know.
She wasn't in bed when
I woke up this morning.
Neither was Conrad when I woke... up...
They both must have had early classes today.
- Good morning, Mr. Spelding.
- Good morning, my boy.
- Well, you're in a good mood I see.
- Oh, never better.
Listen to this:
"The Amalgamated Television
Network today renewed."
"Roger Putnam Spelding's contract for another 5 years."
It's your work my boy.
I want you to know that I'm deeply grateful.
Well, don't mention it...
- Dad.
- Dad?
- Well, Mr. Spelding...
- Yes?
You see, there comes a time in every spaceman's life, when he finally meets the girl of his clouds.
Now, you see sir, I've put away enough blue dingles not only to support...
Roger, Mr. Kreton, come quickly.
This is actually the uh... point I'm uh... trying to make Mr. Spelding uh...
You see, Mr. Spelding... oh.
Now what is it?
- The most wonderful thing has happened.
- What happened?
They married. Conrad and Ellen are husband and wife.
- Husband and wife?
- They did elope.
- You see, dad...
- Dad!?!
Mr. Spelding, we just had to get married.
What do you mean "had to?"
Well, I mean we couldn't wait another minute. Not with him around.
- So we eloped.
- Eloped you, you, you...
- Goat herder you.
- Ellen!
Daddy please!
- I don't know why you but I...
- We thought of this...
Don't get upset, Mr. Spelding,
I guess the best man won.
- Now wait a minute.
- Excuse me dear.
I don't believe the children have had breakfast.
- Conrad, you will stay.
- I'll be happy to.
Congratulations, old man,
I hope we can still be friends.
You mean you don't feel
"that way" about Ellen?
Oh, she's like a sister to me.
A sister, eh, Kreton?
Well, I'll just show them how you really feel about her.
Ellen oh, Ellen, you babe with that crazy build.
I've been watching you shake it around this house
and you’ve been watching me watching you and it's driving me mad.
Wow!
Kreton, what are you saying?
I do not know, someone unzipped my mind.
Mr. Delton. Please.
We don't need words honey, not you and me.
The first time I saw you, bells rang,
the earth moved.
It was like there was nobody else in the world.
Just you and me, and the black burning nights,
exploding like a thousand roman candles.
I propose, mister, that you discontinue this line of thought at once.
No, no, it's fascinating, really.
But Ellen, I didn't mean a word of it.
- That is I, I meant it, but...
- What?
No I didn't mean to say it.
Actually, Ellen, I...
And your hungry eyes, begging me, imploring me and pleading with me,
to take you in my powerful arms.
Wow.
Ellen look, actually this is whole...
Mister the woman you love happens to be my wife.
- Conrad, please.
- Wait just easy honey. Barrier nothing...
Conrad... go ahead.
Conrad!
Get up.
Let him have it, Kreton.
Just bop him one.
There will be no bopping.
Stand still.
It's stuck, Mr. Delton, please, it won't hit.
- Mine won't hit.
- Hit me.
- Mine don't hit.
- Conrad, now stop it.
Mine don't hit.
- What's the matter, you a coward?
- That's it, yeah.
Fight!
Daddy do something.
With pleasure.
It don't hit. It's... I'd fight if I could hit.
- Conrad, now please.
- Well he started it.
What's going on? What's happening in here?
What are you all standing around for?
What are you so excited about? Whats???
What's he doing down there?
I'm hanging up the phone.
I hit him.
You... you hit him and you aren't disintegrated?
I can't understand it. The boy's lost his power.
Lost his power?
Then I'm safe. I can do my duty.
Oh this is a day.
Haven't you time for a cup of coffee, Bob?
No, no, not now. Keep him cornered Conrad.
I'll get the state police right away.
The National Guard.
The commander general of the area.
Excuse me.
Take it easy, boy, take it easy.
We'll get you up.
We'll get you up out of there, come on, up we go.
There... there there there.
- I said if you got up I'd hit him again.
- Oh now look...
Let me at him. They don't call me the Manassas mauler for nothing.
- Shut up.
- Well, I didn't mean anything...
- Are you alright?
- Oh yes, I'm fine. Thank you.
Just wet. You see, where I come from we don't feel pain.
Oh, we feel wet. You'll feel wet water...
But you don't feel pain.
Like for instance...
That's what he thinks.
I didn't even feel the slightest twinge of...
Pain!
- What is it?
- Oh my arms. Mr. Delton.
You wanted to be an earthling, my boy, so take everything that goes with it.
Oh, the leg. Just kick the leg, there's a pain.
Oh, the back is a pain.
There's a head... there's a stomach.
Oh, the foot is a pain...
Oh! No more pain!
Mabel is using the phone gotta use your...
What you...? After him.
Don't let him get away.
- He's gonna kill me.
- Well... Ah!
Come back and fight like a man.
You fight your way, I'll fight mine.
Come on, open up.
Come out and fight.
I won't come out and I won't fight.
Come on open up, you coward.
That's why I won't come out,
I'm a coward. That's it.
A spaceman, general.
S-p-a-s-e. I mean: C.
Yes, the state police are on their way now, sir.
Oh, good, good. I hope you can make it, sir.
Where's a gun?
- Oh Conrad.
- There's a gun.
Conrad, deserting your post of duty?
I need this in case he tries to break out.
Give me that, it's just a conversation piece any...
Sure talks loud, don't it?
Oh, the police.
Excuse me, I better go make sandwiches and coffee.
Come on, there's nothing to be afraid of.
Let's get out there. Come on.
Well, after you folks. After you.
I'll stay in back so
I can plan our strategy.
Watch it. Watch it, he's in there.
He's in there men. He's in there.
He's in there.
Careful now. He may be dangerous.
He's jet propelled.
No he ain't, it's Myrtle. Myrtle did it.
Myrtle you come back here.
Whoa!
Alright, out of here.
Out of here. You might get hurt.
I am hurt.
All right men, grab a line get moving.
Let's go.
Loudspeaker.
Alright mister, we've got you covered.
I said, we've got you covered.
- Pardon me.
- Certainly.
Myrtle, here Myrtle. Where did you go to?
Come to papa, you hear?
Give me that!
You haven't got a chance.
Come out with your hands over your head..
I said, come out with your hands over your head.
- Sorry I took so long, dear.
- Rheba.
- Ellen?
- No thank you.
Come out with your hands over your head.
Officer, egg salad or tuna fish sandwiches?
Please, ma'am, not now.
Conrad?
We mean business, if you don't come out we'll have to use the teargas.
Tear gas. That's a good idea.
Pardon me.
There he is men. Watch him.
Keep your eyes on him.
The wind must have changed.
It's backfiring.
Watch yourself.
Put the women in the cars!
Roll up the windows!
Roll them up fast!
Myrtle.
Myrtle.
Myrtle.
Myrtle.
I can still fly. I can still fl... yow.
Come down out of that barn, mister.
I am out.
I'm going in.
The general doesn't want us to rush the place until he gets here.
He's on the way with a Life photographer.
You naughty spaceship, you shouldn't go away without me.
Wait, wait, slow down. Slow down, your gonna get me s... ohh.
Oh!
Oh, I'm sorry. Hello, Mr. Delton.
It's your ship.
Had enough, young man?
Oh, yes indeed. Yes sir. I've had it.
Well, you always wanted to be an Earthling and now you know what it's like.
You felt the pain of love, the pain of jealousy...
And the pain of pain. And that is the worst pain.
This is a crazy mixed up planet,
Mr. Delton. I'd like to get out of here.
And you'll never come back again?
Never. I promise. The furthest
I'll never go is the moon.
You've learnt a good lesson, my boy.
Remember, the grass is always greener on the other side of the universe.
So keep your nose out of other people's planets.
And from now on, I will.
Sorry, Mr. Delton, I hit my...
- Mr. Mayberry?
- Sir.
Wheres that spaceman?
Spaceman, General? There ain't no such animal.
So long, Earth. It's been lots of...
Mr. Delton.
Oh, Mr. Delton!
Mr. Delton help.
Help! Mr. Delton!
Help me!
It was in that time of year called Indian summer,
That season when the Canadian wilderness...
Is touched with
Autumn's mystery.
It's a time when change is in the air,
When migration is in the blood...
And the homing instinct is strong in the heart.
It's a time of busy comings and goings,
Of constant commotion and unexplained restlessness.
Yet, as each day ends, nature sleeps again,
And the night brings a peaceful calm.
It was in this uncertain season,
In this same wild section of Canada,
That this story had its beginnings.
One evening, a man named John Longridge...
Was passing the time with some old friends.
They were good company, these three.
For a bachelor, almost like having a family around.
Washing will be done on the floor.
Yet, things weren't as perfect as they seemed.
It so happened, this wasn't the animals' true home.
And this man, for all his hospitality and kindness,
Wasn't their real master.
And that accounted for the lonely look...
In the young retriever's eyes.
Hello.
I'm sorry, I can't hear you.
Mrs. Oakes?
Yes, it's me, Mr. Longridge.
Can you hear me?
I hear you.
I wanted to know what time you'd be leaving in the morning.
About seven.
Trouble is,
I can't make it by then.
Sorry, Mrs. Oakes,
I've lost you again.
I think it's somebody else on the line.
If that's you, Winifred, you get off this minute.
Do you hear me?
Winifred?
- You're still there.
- I can tell.
What I was trying to tell you, Mr. Longridge,
I can't get there until nine o'clock.
That's quite all right.
You're sure now?
Nine o'clock...
Is all right?
Of course, and before you get here I'll take...
The 2 dogs and the cat...
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Mr. Longridge?
The joys of living in the country.
Well, that was your friend,
Mrs. Oakes.
Now, how about a run?
Come on, you two.
For a man who'd never kept pets,
Longridge had learned the ropes quickly.
He knew the animals expected and enjoyed...
Their nightly romp outdoors.
He'd learned not to worry about them.
They'd be back in their own good time.
"Dear Mrs. Oakes,
"we are out of coffee.
"Please order more.
"I'll be taking dogs...
"and Tao, too, of course,
"out for a morning run...
"before I leave.
"Don't worry yourself too much over them.
I know they will be fine."
No bears out tonight?
Rabbits? Skunks?
No other cats?
Come on, Luath.
You're letting in the cold.
At bedtime every night,
The retriever liked to get off by himself,
So he slept in the kitchen.
The comfort-loving Siamese chose the hearth...
In front of the fire.
But the bull terrier wouldn't settle for anything less...
Than the master bedroom.
Old Bodger had his own basket, his own blanket,
And his own sly plans.
The moment the man dropped off to sleep,
The dog would sneak out of his own bed...
And then climb into the big one.
He practically never missed his chance.
But tonight for some reason, the man stayed awake.
He was calling to mind again,
How he'd come to have
3 remarkable animals...
Belonging to somebody else.
It was one weekend at professor Hunter's house.
The Hunters were his closest friends.
He was godfather to the daughter,
And sort of an unofficial uncle to the son.
This, somehow, gave him a special interest in their pets.
Come on, Bodger, jump!
Get the ball!
On this Sunday, as usual, he was invited to dinner,
And this happened to be the day the exciting telegram came.
I've been offered a visiting fellowship at Oxford.
Here's what they say.
"A series of 12 lectures.
Lodging for family available.
Hope you will accept."
It's wonderful news!
You are going to accept?
Well, it does mean a lot to my career...
And Nancy's willing.
Nancy was more than willing.
In fact, everybody was thrilled,
And in their excitement had forgotten something important.
What will we do about Tao while we're away?
Hey, that's right.
What about Bodger?
I must confess, this is a problem I'd overlooked.
Don't worry, we'll find a good kennel and board them out.
But mother, not Tao.
You know how he hates to be cooped up.
he wouldn't be that cooped up.
He'd be with other cats.
but he hates other cats.
might do him good.
Sometimes, I think, he thinks he's a dog.
Well, suppose we settle this later.
No need to bother John with the problem.
Ah, but I have the answer.
There I am rattling around that big house of mine, right?
I know the animals.
The animals know me.
So there's no need to board them out.
They will stay with me.
About the time everyone else was in bed,
It was the cat's habit to wake up and go prowling.
A shadow, a moth, a beam of moonlight,
His curiosity took him everywhere.
On this particular night, his exploring...
Would sort of miscarry.
Without his knowing it, he had opened the door...
For the incredible journey.
Next morning, as he'd planned,
John Longridge got off to an early start.
For as long as he could remember,
He'd never missed the opening day of duck season.
Here it was, that time of year again.
Luath,
Young fella,
You'd like to come along, but I'm afraid it wouldn't do.
You couldn't leave your friends,
Now, could you?
Why, Luath.
This is the first time.
You charmer, you.
Well, young fella, you're the steady one,
So you'll look after the other two.
Won't you?
Au revoir.
Now, the animals were alone,
And for all they knew, completely deserted.
Silence fell upon the scene,
Silence that seemed to stretch away to the ends of the earth.
Then voices spoke.
Wild geese called,
Wild geese going home.
Somehow, this was an urge the young dog could understand.
For in him, the homing instinct was strong, too.
Among these three, the bond of friendship was binding.
Wherever one would go, the others would follow.
So it was,
The animals set out for home.
They couldn't know it was 200 miles away.
They only knew that it was somewhere off to the west,
So they would follow the sun.
The incredible journey had begun.
That's funny.
I don't see the animals.
They're always out to welcome us.
Probably Mr. Longridge left them inside...
Knowing you was coming.
I s'pose so.
Bring the vacuum cleaner,
Will ya, Bert?
Now, where do you s'pose they've gone to?
Bodger, Luath?
Where could those rascals be?
Probably gone up to the school.
There's no note at all.
He goes up there sometimes to play with the kids.
Where's the cat?
He wouldn't go up there.
Luath, Tao?
Here puss, puss, puss.
Bodger?
Here, boy.
Here, boy!
Luath? Tao?
Bodger?
They're not outside.
Probably hunting.
The cat, maybe. I never saw such an animal for hunting.
But the dogs, they wouldn't go off.
Quit stewing.
They'll show up.
Where do you want this plugged in?
Right there, in front of your nose.
Oh, for heaven's sakes.
Here's a note from
Mr. Longridge, after all.
That's funny.
"I'll be taking the dogs and Tao too, of course."
Now what do you s'pose he means by that?
Just what it says.
He's got the animals.
Why didn't he say so on the phone?
Don't ask me.
Wait a minute.
I remember now.
Last night when the phone went dead,
Mr. Longridge was just about to tell me something.
Then, don't worry. He's got the dogs and the cat, too.
You've got nothing to fuss about.
Well, all I can say is that...
It sure beats me how some people can change their minds.
As it turned out, not a single person concerned...
Would know of the secret departure.
By this time, the animals were well on their way.
From the very start,
The travelers had adopted a certain marching order.
The young dog became the natural leader,
For he was the one driven by the desire to get home.
The old dog was more of a follower,
Quite satisfied to let someone else show the way.
He wasn't too sure he could make it,
But he'd try for his friends' sake.
The cat, meanwhile, was everywhere;
Sometimes in front, sometimes far behind,
Sometimes off on side trips of his own.
As the little procession went along,
The dogs were the dedicated ones,
And the cat the happy-go-lucky one...
Ready for anything, especially hunting.
Along about mid-afternoon of that first day,
The animals were getting a little tired...
And beginning to feel the effects of their long walk.
They put their heads together a moment,
And even the ambitious young leader seemed to agree...
It was time to stop.
When he'd had his fill, the retriever led off again.
He took it for granted that the rest periods would be short,
That they'd immediately push on.
It seemed, though,
That his partners weren't of the same mind.
Old Bodger's feet hurt.
The truth of the matter was,
This was almost too much for an old dog...
No longer in his prime.
The others would just have to wait while he took a moment out.
The cat was agreeable.
Especially since he'd stumbled onto something...
Well worth waiting around for.
Car coming!
Might be someone who would recognize them, and this was...
The last thing they wanted.
The scare over, it was time to get going again.
If the old terrier had been alone at this moment,
He probably wouldn't have bothered.
He was stiff in every joint, and definitely feeling his years.
Much more of this and he'd be through.
By morning of the second day,
Bodger was definitely beginning to slow down.
It was becoming more and more apparent...
He'd soon have to rest.
But the young leader couldn't bring himself to stop,
Not this early in the game,
And he kept urging his friends to push on.
As the leader,
It was the retriever's job to choose the way.
He seemed to have an uncanny knack...
Of always knowing where west was.
So far as he was concerned,
There'd be no such thing as obstacles.
He would keep going in a straight line.
It was up to the others to follow.
For Bodger, it wasn't quite that simple.
His sore feet were beginning to give him real trouble,
And his pace was getting slower and slower.
Many miles farther on,
Near mid-afternoon of the second day,
The weary old terrier had just about reached his limit.
The collapse, when it came, was total.
His legs simply folded up under him.
The young dog hated to stop, yet he knew he had to.
He couldn't leave his friend.
There was nothing else to do...
But wait until Bodger could get his second wind.
And if possible, somewhere, somehow, something to eat.
In fact, all of them were getting hungry,
And before much longer,
Would need something more to go on, than water.
If food was to be found,
It was likely the cat would be the first to find it.
Suddenly, the chance popped up right in front of him.
Old Bodger stayed put, glad for the chance to rest.
As yet, he wasn't aware that he was a celebrity of sorts.
Somehow the news had got around about him,
And now the curious came to look him over.
These two decided not to be standoffish about it,
But to give him their greeting in person.
Bodger, perhaps,
Could have done with a little less of the personal touch,
But he was much too tired to object.
Pretty soon the cubs had had enough, too.
To their way of thinking,
This dull stranger wasn't much for fun.
In another moment,
They'd invented a game with a lot more action in it,
Action...
And noise.
From a distance, it sounded like a really vicious fight.
Alarming enough to raise a mother's fears,
And make her come a runnin'.
Thoroughly aroused,
The she-bear needed a target.
Somebody'd been hurtin' her cubs,
And somebody would have to suffer the consequences.
It had been a near thing for Bodger,
Weak as he was and almost helpless.
But now the cat would cheer him up.
He would bring the meal so badly needed.
Within a few minutes...
The old dog was quite himself again,
Revived and refreshed, and ready for the road.
By the end of the first week,
The animals had learned to travel after sundown.
For then, they stood less chance of being seen.
Generally, they steered around settlements,
But one night they decided to break their rule.
An old sawmill looked deserted enough to risk it,
And they chose the shortcut.
Everything went along all right...
Until Bodger got wind of the cook house.
Being shot at was something new for the old terrier.
It sort of shook his faith in human nature.
But worse than that,
It made him look foolish in front of his friends.
He could sense it in their accusing looks.
After 10 days on the trail,
The animals were weak with hunger,
And had begun to get discouraged.
Even the determined young leader.
By now,
They were ready to stalk any wild game they could find.
The cat, of course, was a natural hunter,
But the dogs were ready to try, too,
Though neither of them was a true hunting breed.
Chasing rabbits was a bit strenuous for the old terrier,
And instead, he rested.
Then, suddenly, he heard singing.
It was old Jeremy, the hermit,
Recluse, and philosopher.
Slightly odd, people said,
But kindly, and very friendly to animals.
Oh, ho!
Good day to you.
Old Jeremy lived close to nature...
In a world of his own.
His friends, the wild creatures of the forest.
Instinctively,
Bodger felt this was a man who might help them.
When the retriever returned and fell in step,
He was sort of lukewarm about it.
This was all against his better judgment.
He wasn't sure...
They wanted to get mixed-up with people.
At the hermit's cabin the young dog hung back,
Still not convinced this was a good idea.
Come in, my dear, around this way.
Presently, Maud, presently.
It was the appetizing smell of the stew...
That finally won the dog over.
However, he would put his rabbit...
Where he could find it later.
Oh, come in, old chap.
Glad to have you aboard.
So the retriever joined his friends,
Prepared to accept the old man's hospitality.
Now, their host went about setting the table.
From long habit, he got out only one plate.
But wait,
Today there would be places for 3 more.
Oh, Maud, you must learn to control yourself.
At last, the half-starved animals...
Were about to enjoy a home-cooked meal.
How lucky that Bodger had spied this friendly old hermit,
And how kind of him to bring them to his bountiful table.
For what we are about to receive,
May the lord make us truly thankful. Amen.
Do sit down.
At the familiar command, the animals sat...
On the floor,
Where most pets have been trained to sit.
All except cats.
Cats, of course, will sit where they please.
Oh, not hungry?
Oh, picky.
His own plate finished,
The old man moved to the next chair and the next serving.
Since no one was eating it,
This seemed the most logical thing to do.
Gradually, it began to dawn on the dogs...
That they might be about to lose out on a good thing.
The last chair, the last plate,
Their last chance.
In the end, it was the crow...
That roused the old man from his daydreaming.
Oh, Maud,
Time for our nap, is it?
Good-bye, old chap.
Nice you could come to dine.
Remember me most kindly to your mother.
Disappointed, but too polite to show it,
The animals carried out their part of the make-believe,
And took themselves off,
Like the well-behaved guests they were.
Delightful people, eh, Maud?
We must have them over again very soon.
Yes.
As it worked out, their luck wasn't all bad.
This rabbit wasn't make-believe,
So they wouldn't starve.
It was to be expected that the wilderness, itself,
Would give them a problem or two.
Now they had one.
At moments like this,
The retriever had a decided advantage over his friends.
For him, being an out-and-out water dog,
Crossing a river was nothing.
In fact, he sort of enjoyed a nice swim.
The bull terrier didn't take to it quite so naturally.
Still, once he got over his fear,
He turned out to be...
A pretty good water dog, too.
But when it came the cat's turn, it was a different proposition.
For the first time on the trip,
He got his back up.
He wouldn't even dip his toe in.
He could face a bear, maybe,
But he couldn't bring himself to face a river.
This was asking too much.
As it turned out,
The cat wouldn't have to get his feet wet, after all.
There was a bridge the beavers had built.
It had a stick or two missing,
But not so much but what the cat couldn't jump over.
He'd crossed many a creek wider than this,
And the dogs were confident he could do it.
The cat was gone, no two ways about it.
Their friend had disappeared.
Instinctively, the dogs knew a sense of loss.
They missed their partner, missed him very much.
They tried to console each other in their common sorrow.
For hours afterward, they stood by...
Refusing to leave.
They seemed to feel that somehow, by hook or crook,
The clever cat would find a way to get back.
If they'd stay just a little longer,
They'd see him comin' along...
As sleek and spry as ever.
But it was a forlorn hope,
And finally, they seemed to understand that.
Now they'd have to forget their best friend and provider,
And push on, just the two of them.
Miles downstream, pure chance would play a part in things.
For in the cat's moment of greatest need,
A helping hand happened to be near.
Papa!
Come and see.
There's a funny looking animal.
See, papa?
Is it a weasel?
No, I don't think so.
No, it's a cat.
Or...
It was a cat.
It's moving.
It's still alive.
Poor thing.
What can we do?
I don't know.
Helvi, you run and get a dry towel,
And I'll heat some milk.
Put some brandy in it, too.
Be careful.
Don't squeeze too hard.
He swallowed half the river.
That poor thing won't need a drink for weeks.
Olga, see if he'll take a little milk and brandy.
Oh, look.
He's moving.
Keep him warm and quiet for awhile.
I've got chores to do.
Will he be all right, papa?
Maybe, maybe not.
Hard to tell just yet.
And so it was, that a half-starved cat...
And a lonely little girl struck up an acquaintance...
That brought comfort and companionship to both.
Good night, mama.
Sleep well.
You, too.
Papa, one little song...
For my cat?
♪ Ol kaunis kesa ilta ♪
♪ Kun laaksossa kavelin ♪
♪ Ol kaunis kesa ilta ♪
♪ Kun laaksossa kavelin ♪
♪ So tun tee Ni voitti ♪
♪ Ja hei tyi syommeni ♪
♪ So tun tee Ni voitti ♪
♪ Ja hei tyi syommeni ♪♪
Later that night, the cat came to the girl,
As though to tell her something.
He was trying to say good-bye.
Something out there was calling him,
And he knew what it was.
He knew he must find the 2 dogs.
Next morning, the cat located the place...
Where the dogs had waited,
And soon had picked up their trail.
Now that he was alone, he could travel...
At his own pace, in his own way,
His natural stealth his protection.
He was almost as much at home in the wilderness...
As the creatures of the wild themselves,
And often watched them pass...
Without their knowing he was anywhere near.
As he went deeper and deeper into the forest,
The cat began to get uneasy.
He had a strange feeling...
He was being followed.
There was nothing in sight,
Yet his senses told him there was something back there,
Something evil.
Evil it was, for it was the lynx,
A wild and wanton killer.
Suddenly, another hunter appeared.
Not as savage as the lynx, perhaps,
But equipped to deal out death, just the same.
When all seemed quiet, the cat went on.
Faster now, to make up for the time he'd lost.
One morning, not long after,
The dogs heard a peculiar call.
It was a cry to stop them in their tracks,
For it sounded like a Siamese cat.
The young dog let Bodger be the first to greet the cat.
He understood that there was...
Something special about this friendship.
Then both dogs offered the cat their affection.
They seemed to want to tell him how much they'd missed him.
Every step of the way, the animals had known hunger,
And by the end of the third week...
Were desperate for food.
By this time, they'd taught themselves...
To chase anything that moved.
Especially if it looked fat and easy to catch.
Now, a porcupine could only mean trouble,
But the dogs weren't experienced enough to know that.
the retriever was struck...
Before he quite knew what had happened.
Something else he didn't know...
Was that the sharp quills were barbed like fishhooks,
And would work their way in deeper.
Instinctively,
The retriever turned to his friends for help,
But Bodger, not knowing what to do,
Only succeeded in making things worse.
When the pain started,
The dog went to water to cool his burning face.
It wasn't a cure, but it was a relief.
It was the only thing he knew to do.
Every few hours,
He found it necessary to repeat the treatment.
And so it was, that he happened to be at a nearby lake...
When the first flight of mallards came in.
Surprised though he was, the hunter was interested, too,
For he could see that the retriever had been well trained.
He was James Mackenzie, fancier of fine hunting dogs...
And a man to admire one when he saw it.
Good dog!
Well done.
Now bring it to me.
Poor laddie.
You've got mixed-up with a porcupine someplace.
Where's your master?
Ahoy!
Or don't you have one?
Whose ever dog it was,
Mackenzie's mind was made up.
The animal must have immediate attention.
The retriever went along without protest.
He seemed to realize...
He needed help,
And must return to the world of humans to find it.
And so, the kindly man led the dog home.
He couldn't know there were others of the party around,
That he might even have touched one...
If he'd known he was there.
Nell, look what I found.
And look what I found.
Another one.
This poor dog's nearly starving.
Aye, so is this one.
Worse than that, he's hurt.
Hurt?
Porcupine quills.
You can see for yourself.
Will he let you touch him?
I think so.
That is if his partner, here, will let me.
Funny, how they seem to know each other.
It's more than that. I think they're traveling together.
Where do you suppose they came from?
I don't know.
Lost from a car traveling cross-country,
It's hard to say.
The main thing is...
This retriever needs help.
When did you find Whitey?
Oh, he found me.
I guess he smelled the bacon cooking.
He came to the door like an old hobo, begging,
And I really mean begging.
I heard this scratching, and there he was carrying on...
Just like he's doing now.
You old clown.
Now, laddie, hold still.
I know this hurts.
Unfortunately, it's got to be done.
There, there, laddie.
It's not as bad as all that.
See if you can get him on the porch.
How?
Food, food.
Your intentions are good, but you're getting in the way.
Shall I go out there with him?
No.
There, I'm through.
Let the other one in.
I can't get over the affection these two show.
Do you think we can find who they belong to?
When I drive into deepwater in the morning,
I'll inquire around, maybe put an ad in the paper.
Meanwhile,
The one person who should have been the first to know,
Would be the last to hear...
Of the events of the past several weeks.
Welcome back,
Mr. Longridge.
Thank you.
I've been watching out for you all morning.
This came the first of the week.
The hunter family...
Will be flying back the day after tomorrow. So I see.
Was it a good trip?
Yes, marvelous.
And the animals, did they have a good time?
The animals?
Why Bodger, and the cat and Luath.
You mean, all this time...
They haven't been with you?
Of course not. I left them here.
But they're not here!
I haven't seen them in 3 weeks.
3 weeks?
When I came, the morning you left,
The animals were nowhere in sight.
And then, I found this note,
Saying that you were taking them with you.
But this is only half of it!
That's all there was,
Mr. Longridge.
Do you suppose they could have been hit by a car?
Or poisoned?
Or stolen?
One of them, maybe,
But not all 3 together.
Yet, they couldn't just vanish.
The retriever,
I keep remembering the look in his eyes.
You know,
On the morning I left,
For the very first time, he offered me his paw.
Mrs. Oakes, they've gone home.
Home?
Home!
The retriever has taken them home.
He was the unhappy one,
So he's simply gone back home.
Someone would have seen them.
Not necessarily.
They wouldn't be where anyone would see them.
You see, traveling by instinct,
They'd simply go west,
Straight across country...
And over the Ironmouth Range.
Over the Ironmouth!
Then there's no use hoping anymore.
Don't let's fool ourselves.
You know old Bodger couldn't last more than 10 miles.
I wouldn't give much for the cat's chances, either.
Operator?
If they did make for home, there's a good chance...
That the big powerful dog, like the retriever,
Would get there.
But it's a long way,
Mr. Longridge.
Yes, I know.
Operator, would you please get me the chief ranger...
Of lands and forests up at the Ironmouth station?
Glad to,
Mr. Longridge.
I'll pass the word on to the game wardens tomorrow.
Yes, sir.
No trouble at all,
Mr. Longridge,
But the reporter that knows that area...
Is up at Windigo covering a plowing contest.
But he'll be in tomorrow, and I'll have him call you.
Yes, Mr. Longridge,
I have maintenance crews all through that country.
I'll be in touch with them in the morning.
Tomorrow, tomorrow.
I gotta know today.
How do you find a dog...
In 200 miles of backwoods country?
That same evening,
James Mackenzie was providing bed-and-board for his guests.
He'd decided to keep the dogs locked up until he could...
Inquire around and find out who they belonged to.
There you are, now.
Spend a quiet night.
The third member of the party,
Whose presence Mackenzie was still unaware of,
Had watched these goings-on with great interest.
He now knew where the dogs were.
He knew they were all alone.
This was his chance to join them.
Neither latch nor lock could keep him from his friends.
The worst thing is, we haven't got a single clue.
Hello.
Yes, this is John Longridge.
Yes!
Yes, that's right.
2 dogs and a Siamese cat.
It's the operator at Lintola.
She says a little girl rescued a Siamese cat.
Oh, it disappeared.
2 weeks ago.
Get me the map.
No sign of the dogs?
Well, thank you very much for calling.
Please let me know if you hear anything more.
Good night.
It's not much to go on,
But apparently the cat got as far as Lintola.
It's about 100 miles from here.
100 miles? There it is, right there.
Lintola.
How could the cat get that far,
And nobody's seen the dogs?
If it was our cat.
What could have happened to those dogs?
Poor old Bodger.
I don't think we're going to solve anything more tonight.
Come on, mother.
We'd better get home,
And let Mr. Longridge get some sleep.
He's gotta be on that plane in the morning.
Yes.
When the hunters get home,
I've got to be there.
That's the least I can do.
But I don't know how I'm going to face up to the children.
At sun-up the next morning,
The retriever was eager to be up and doing.
The old restlessness had returned.
It was time to press on.
For a moment,
His determination seemed to weaken.
He was grateful for the kind treatment he had received.
Yet, the homing call was stronger than gratitude,
And he knew he must answer it.
Ahead lay the Ironmouth Range,
Rugged, forbidding, and uninhabited.
Now, the animals were beyond all human help.
And worst of all,
A biting edge of cold could be felt in the air.
Already ice had begun to form in the stream.
Before many more days, the river's voice would be still,
And this land frozen under winter snows.
At the hunter's house, meanwhile,
The telephone had been kept busy day and night.
Thank you for calling.
Good night.
That's the best bet, yet.
A man named Mackenzie, who lives in Conrad,
Says he actually had the dogs only 3 days ago.
Had the dogs?
Yeah. He didn't know about the cat,
But the dogs answer our description.
Why didn't he keep them?
He must have known they belonged to somebody.
He did. He locked them in his barn,
But they managed to get away.
He figures they're headed through here.
Through the primitive area.
Then there's no hope.
There might be, Jim.
They made it this far.
It's only 40 miles more.
But 40 miles of what?
The worst kind of country!
Nancy, as you can guess,
I've regretted that day when I offered to take the animals.
Nonsense, John.
None of that.
It wasn't your fault.
Oh, sure.
But try to tell the youngsters that.
They'll get over it, in time.
Peter doesn't say much.
I think he knew from the beginning...
That an old dog wouldn't stand a chance.
I think he's accepted the fact that poor old Bodger's gone.
And Elizabeth?
Elizabeth's a strange one.
She's just the opposite.
Firmly convinced in her own mind...
That her cat's going to show up.
Just has faith that her old
Tao cat will come walking in...
As sassy and independent as ever.
The grownups wished they could share the child's belief,
But they knew it was too much to hope for.
It was better to forget what had happened...
And look forward to happier occasions.
♪ happy birthday, dear Peter ♪
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪♪
Bravo!
Blow them out.
Did you make a wish?
I don't feel much like it, really.
Not the wish I'd like to wish.
Peter, I was going to wait until you opened your presents,
But I think this is the right time for you to have this.
Happy birthday.
What is it?
Registration papers from the Kenmore Kennels.
They're holding a puppy in your name.
Well, Peter.
Another bull terrier.
How nice of you, John.
What's his name?
He's properly named, as tradition says,
Starting with a "B."
Champion Birmingham...
Brigadier of Brocton.
What's his color?
White, of course.
And so much like Bodger,
I just couldn't believe it!
Peter, darling, can't you say thank you?
Thank you, Uncle John.
Suppose we serve the cake now, hmm?
Elizabeth, would you get the ice cream, please?
All right. Very nice of you, John.
Listen.
Listen, everybody!
What is it?
I hear a dog barking.
I don't hear anything.
I do.
Daddy, it's Luath!
Oh, Liz, please don't.
But I'm sure of it.
I know his bark.
I think I hear it, too,
Up on the hill.
It's probably just somebody out hunting.
You know, James, Luath might have been able to make it.
It could be Luath, dad.
Try calling him.
For a magic moment,
James Hunter was as a child again,
Hoping against hope.
It is!
It is Luath!
Look at him come!
Come on, Luath!
Come on, boy!
Good boy, Luath.
I can't believe it.
Luath!
In the general excitement, everything else was forgotten,
Peter, Bodger, and the cat.
Quite ignored until Elizabeth...
Heard a familiar voice.
Mother, it's Tao!
He's back!
Tao!
I can't believe it.
I know it's true,
But I can't believe it!
I'd never have bet on it.
It was hard to believe, yet there he was...
Safe in Elizabeth's arms.
Her cat was home.
Peter, I'm sorry.
Oh, it's all right.
Hi there, Luath.
I'm glad he's back, dad.
And Tao cat, too.
I knew all along
Bodger wouldn't make it.
He was just too old.
But Peter, you're not old, and he's the same age.
I feel old.
And with dogs it's different.
Look!
Bodger!
Bodger!
Bodger!
Miraculous as it seemed, it was Bodger.
Champion Buracastle
Brigadier of Doon,
Coming as fast as he could.
Come on, boy.
Hurry!
It is you!
Come on!
Oh, Bodger!
It is you, you silly dog.
Cut it out, Bodger.
Bodger, stop it.
And so it was,
3 devoted friends came marching home,
Together as always,
They came to the end of their incredible journey.

Hm.
Yes, I really could.

Huh?
No.

Phew.
I swear to it by this holy hemlock branch.
Okay. Come on, let’s move in.
One, dry algae to make flour from it. so I can continue my experiments.
Wow!

What are you doing up here?
But you’re alone. right down there in that gorge.
You one of them?
Oh, no, ma’ ’am.
Come on!
Where do you live, boy?
I’m going to get me a baby falcon or die trying.

Thank you.
Peregrine falcons. if my memory serves me right, and it usually does.
Of course.

Uh-huh.
Sam... you'll need a leather glove.
SAM: And so I bought some gloves.
Hey, what should we call her?
How about Frightful?
Frightful it is.
Come on, Frightful
I’m going to teach her to catch our dinner for us
And so my training of Frightful began.
Come on, little one. Come on.
That’s it.
You eat only when you're on my hand.
Good girl, Frightful.
Yeah. you'll have that BB gun of yours zeroed in...
I scraped the hair from the hide. and had a place to tan the deer hide.
Now I'm really getting prepared for the colder weather. but she has not yet learned to come to the lure.
Good girl, Frightful.
Good girl. so I was still experimenting with natural food sources.
Algae soup, here we come.
Hey, Gus, you got a friend.
Hey, you guys, how about some algae soup?
Well, at least somebody likes it.
Okay, Frightful, you’re on your own. you'll turn wild on me again.
Come on.
I'm going to share this with you.
Testemondia.
And who's that ferocious-looki creature, huh?
Look, name is Bando.
Let's be friends, huh?
How about you?
And I record them.
Come on, let’s be friends, huh?
Okay. take me to your leader.
The only way.
I agree.
SAM: Well, what do you think of it,
Bando? I mean, really?
William Shakespeare, my boy.
Say, Sam... if I stayed the ni ght here around the fire?
Come on.

Well, I'll be...

I just don't need anybody.
This is a good place to fly Frightful.

Right now, all this seems pretty dull. for any sugar tomorrow. we’re going to make us some syrup.

It should stand up well to heat.
When are you going, Bando?
Oh, any day now.
Find me some new strumming music, Sam. doing it all myself.
Mail a letter for me? so is good news from a far country. with any human animal.
She'’’s a great lady. the whole change that’s going come over this place.
You've got a great thing going for you up here.
Thanks, Bando.
I hope you find some new songs.
There’s always songs.
Well, so long now.
Keep in touch.
Everybody's leaving us,
Frightful. being alone, doing it... myself.
Hello, Mr. Otter.
Dried algae for your dinner today?
How about that, huh?
Here you go, Mr. Otter.
We're going to make it.
Bando was right about building that fireplace.
Hey, Gus, stop eating up our old fireplace.
Anyway, I finally got something that looks like a fireplace. we’ll have us a nice, warm home.
You'll need a leather glove.
(harmonica and guitar playing melody)
You lost, boy?
Air.
Air.
The fireplace is using up all our oxygen, Gus.
Now we won't suffocate.
Honest, he did.
I won't be gone long.
Hi
Did you, uh, manage to observe those falcons at close range?
Then come on.
Wait till you see her in the sky.
Oh, she'’’s glorious.
Goodbye, Sam.
Goodbye, Miss Turner. and I was glad to talk to someone.
(Henry Mancini's
"Baby Elephant Walk" playing)
Oh, sure.
I am. and how to live off it.
It's dying.
Frightful.
She was my pet.
Yes, to be as deadly as any gun. and with it... came the snow. look so different, so bare and desolate.
I really loved her, and I need her. and mountains and marshes, as easily as the deer.
So bare and desolate.
Gus?
Gus?
Gu... (chittering)
Gus.
I thought you’d run off or something.
Hey, Gus, want an algae ice cream cone?
Well, let's go up and thaw it out.
Hi, you guys. Having fun?
Ew!
It decays as soon as the ice is melted away from it. because my breath fogs up the mirror and the eyepiece.
Wonder what Pasteur would have done. millions of miles away.
Most of the animals are hiding out from us.
We’re snowed in.
We've gotta save our oxygen, Gus.
BANDO:
Sam? Sam?
Sam, where are you?
Sam?
Sam, where are you?
I’m snowed in. Here. Here
BANDO:
You keep digging up.
I'm digging down to you.
That’s right, you keep digging up.
I'll be right back.
Come on.
Come on there, Gus.
I was in that old tree for two days.
Oh, Bando.
Oh, that’s too bad. to keep it growi ng after it got cold.
Now, Sam, what did I tell you about trusting me?
By the way, Sam, you got quite a few people worried about you.
And I came because of my experiments.
And I learned about survival.
I learned about myself.
That's quite a lot.
What now, Sam?
I've learned all I can here.
It's just time to go home.

If you're all through
I'll tell you about this Harold Hill.
Say, you know Hill?
Never saw him in my life. But I just been run out of town because of Hill.
He's giving every one of us a black eye.
You go into town to call on the trade...
...and they're waiting for you with tar and feathers...
...to ride you out the city limits on a rail!
How you account for that?
It's this Hill! He goes around selling band instruments and uniforms...
...and instruction books by guaranteeing to teach the kids to play.
- Stands to reason.
- And organize them kids into a band...
...with himself as the leader.
What's wrong with that?
He don't know one note...
...from another!
- Heh-heh.
That's what's wrong!
He don't know a bass drum from a pipe organ.
He's a bare-faced, double-shuffle, two-bit thimblerigger!
And I'll catch up with him one of these days.
When I do I'll have the law on him quick!
Territory's tough enough without him fouling up the nest.
I'd like to be around when you catch up with him.
I'm not apt to catch up with him in lowa.
Not on your kidney plaster!
He's too smart to pull that flimflam out here.
Not on these neck-bowed Hawkeyes.
Gentlemen, you intrigue me.

But he just said lo-way.

But we don't like anybody else to.

Well, you folks certainly do know how to make a body feel at home.

Why didn't you tell me you were coming?
I didn't know I was, myself.
I never thought I'd find a slicker like you here in the sarsaparilla belt.
This is where I work.
- You mean you live in this town?
- Yeah. I like it too.
It's not Brooklyn, New York.
Not the city of homes and churches but-
Brooklyn?
Marce, this isn't even Dubuque.
Hey. Are you hiding out or what?
Just not as light on my feet as I used to be when I was shilling for you.
You're in a business that got a lot of close shaves.
I got a nice job now.
I got a nice girl.
Ethel Toffelmier.
That's the boss's niece.
So you've gone legitimate, huh?
I knew you'd come to no good.
What are you selling now?
I heard you were in steam automobiles.
- I was.
- What happened?
- Somebody actually invented one.
- No!
So now I'm back at the old stand.
Not boys' bands?
They got no call for boys' bands in this town.
Anything lowa folk don't have they do without.
They got music?
They got a gramophone down to the barber shop.
And a stuck-up librarian gives piano.
- Gives piano?
- A maiden lady.
She'll expose you before you unpack this bag.
Maiden lady librarians who give piano are a specialty of mine.
Just point her out the minute you see her.
Yeah. I'll back her into a corner and breathe on her glasses.
Thar she blows!
I'll do it but I won't like it.
That's not the librarian.
That's Mrs. Shinn, the mayor's wife.
Good afternoon, Mrs. Shinn.
Don't change the subject.
Something the matter?
The same thing is the matter as is always the matter here. Look!
Is this the sort of book you give my daughter?
This Ruby Hat of Omar Kay-ay-ay-
I am appalled!
I did recommend it.
It's beautiful Persian poetry.
It's dirty Persian poetry.
People lying out in the woods eating sandwiches.
Getting drunk with pitfall and with gin.
Drinking directly out of jugs with innocent young girls.
- No daughter of mine-
- Mrs. Shinn.
The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam is a classic.
It's a smutty book, like most of the others you keep here, I daresay.
Honestly, Mrs. Shinn.
Wouldn't you rather have your daughter read a classic than Elinor Glyn?
What Elinor Glyn reads is her mother's problem.
Just you keep your dirty books away from my daughter.
You sure picked yourself a town.
Let me take you over to the hotel.
Not sure I'm going to stay yet.
First I got to find a way to get into some of these lowa boodlebags.
Greg, it ain't easy.
All I need is an opening.
You remember the pitch. What can I use?
What's new around here?
The other day a farmer brought in an egg had 3 yolks in it.
Was in the paper.
That's exciting, all right.
No, what do you talk about?
There's the weather, of course.
When it's in season.
Now, Marce, I need some ideas...
...if I'm going to get your town out of the serious trouble it's in.
River City ain't in any trouble.
We'll have to create some.
Must create a desperate need in your town for a boys' band.
Why is everyone rubbering into the billiard parlor?
They just got in a new pool table.
They must have seen one before.
No. Just billiards.
That'll do it!
Just sit where you are.
And remember...
...if you see that music teacher...
Are you Mr. Dunlop?
Either you're closing your eyes to a situation you don't wish to acknowledge...
...or you are not aware of the caliber of disaster...
...indicated by the presence of a pool table in your community.
Well, you got trouble, my friend
Right here, I say
Trouble right here in River City
Why, sure, I'm a billiard player
Certainly mighty proud to say
I'm always proud to say it
I consider that the hours I spend
With a cue in my hand are golden
Help you cultivate horse sense
And a cool head and a keen eye
You ever take and try to give
An ironclad leave to yourself
From a three-rail billiard shot?
But just as I say
It takes judgment, brains and maturity
To score in a balk-line game
I say that any boob
Can take and shove a ball in a pocket
And I call that sloth
The first big step on the road
To the depths of degrada- I say first
Medicinal wine from a teaspoon
Then beer from a bottle
The next thing you know your son is
Playing for money in a pinch-back suit
And listening to some big
Out-o'- town jasper
Hearing him tell about
Horserace gambling
Not a wholesome trotting race, no
But a race where they set down
Right on the horse!
Like to see some stuck-up jockey boy
Setting on Dan Patch?
Make your blood boil?
Well, I should say!
Now, friends
Let me tell you what I mean
You got 1, 2, 3, 4
5, 6 pockets in a table
Pockets that mark the difference
Between a gentleman and a bum
With a capital B and that
Rhymes with P and that stands for pool
And all week long your River City
Youth'll be frittering away
I say your young men'll be frittering
Frittering away their noontime
Suppertime, chore time too
Get the ball in the pocket
Never mind getting dandelions pulled
Or the screen door patched
Or the beefsteak pounded
Never mind pumping any water
Till your parents are caught
With the cistern empty on a Saturday night
And that's trouble
Yes, you got lots and lots of trouble
I'm thinking of the kids in the
Knickerbockers, shirttail young ones
Peeking in the pool hall window
After school
You got trouble, folks
Right here in River City
Trouble with a capital T and that
Rhymes with P and that stands for pool
Now I know all you folks
Are the right kind of parents
I'm going to be perfectly frank
Would you like to know what kind of
Conversation goes on
While they're loafing around that hall?
They'll be trying out Bevo
Trying out Cubebs
Trying out Tail or Mades
Like cigarette fiends
And bragging all about
How they're going to cover up
A telltale breath with Sen-Sen
One fine night they leave the pool hall
Headin' for the dance at the Armory
Libertine men and scarlet women
And ragtime
Shameless music
That'll grab your son
Your daughter, with the arms of
A jungle animal instinct mass-teria
Friends, the idle brain
Is the devil's playground, trouble!
We got trouble
- Right here in River City
With a capital T and that rhymes with P
And that stands for pool
We've surely got trouble
Right here in River City
Got to figure out a way to keep
The young ones moral after school
Our children's children
Gonna have trouble
Mothers of River City, heed that warning before it's too late.
Watch for the telltale signs of corruption.
The minute your son leaves the house...
...does he rebuckle his knickerbockers below the knee?
Is there a nicotine stain on his index finger?
A dime novel hidden in the corn crib?
Is he starting to memorize jokes from Captain Billy's Whiz Bang?
Are certain words creeping into his conversation?
Words like...
Like "swell."
And "So's your old man."
If so, my friends...
You got trouble
Right here in River City
With a capital T and that rhymes with P
And that stands for pool
We surely got trouble
Right here in River City
Remember the Maine, Plymouth Rock
And the Golden Rule
Our children's children
Gonna have trouble
Oh-ho, we got trouble
We're in terrible, terrible trouble
That game with the 15 numbered balls
Is the devil's tool
Oh, yes, we got
Trouble, trouble, trouble
- With a T
- With a capital T
Got to rhyme it with P
And that stands for pool
Remember, my friends, listen to me
Because I pass this way but once!
- Did you drop your-?
- No.
- Didn't I meet you in-?
- No.
I'll only be in town a short while.
Good!
Hello, Mama.
Keep on, Amaryllis.
I'll be there in a minute.
That's fine, dear.
Now on with your exercises.
Library open later than usual tonight, dear?
It always is, Mama.
Mama, a man with a suitcase followed me home.
Oh? Who?
I never saw him before.
Did he say anything?
He tried.
Did you say anything?
Of course not, Mama.
Now don't dawdle, Amaryllis.
So, do
La, re, ti, me
A little slower
And please keep the fingers curved
As nice and high as you possibly can
Don't get faster, dear.
It wouldn't have hurt you...
...to have found out what the gentleman wanted.
I know what the gentleman wanted.
What, dear?
You'll find it in Balzac.
Excuse me for living, but I never read it.
Neither has anyone else in this town
There you go again
With the same old comment
About the low mentality
Of River City people
And taking it all too much to heart
Now, Mama, as long as the...
Madison Public Library
Was entrusted to me
For the purpose of improving
River City's cultural level
I can't help my concern that
The ladies of River City
Keep ignoring
All my counsel and advice
But, darling!
When a woman has a husband
And you've got none
Why should she take advice from you
Even if you can quote
Balzac and Shakespeare
And all them other
Highfalutin Greeks?
If you don't mind my saying so
You have a bad habit
Of changing every subject
No, I haven't changed the subject
I was talking about that stranger
- What stranger?
- With the suitcase
Who may be your very last chance
Do you think that I'd allow
A common masher? Now really, Mama!
I have my standards
Where men are concerned
And I have no intention-
I know all about your standards
And if you don't mind my saying so
There's not a man alive
Who could hope to measure up
To that blend of Paul Bunyan,
Saint Pat and Noah Webster
You've concocted for yourself
Out of your Irish imagination
Your lowa stubbornness
And your library full of books
Well, if that isn't the best I ever heard!
Thank you.
Can I have a drink, please?
- May I-?
- May I have a drink, please?
Yes, you may.
Hello, Winthrop.
Winthrop, it's after dark, dear!
I'm having a party on Saturday.
Will you please come?
It's going to be a very nice party.
And I'd especially like it if you'd-
Amaryllis asked you to her party.
Are you going or aren't you?
- No.
- No, what?
No, thank you.
You know the little girl's name.
I'll bet he won't say it.
"No, thank you," who, Winthrop?
No, thank you, Amaryllith!
"Amaryllith"!
He's crying!
Hello, Winthrop.
Winthrop, you didn't even say hello to your sister.
He hates to say Amaryllis because of the lisp.
He's ashamed.
We know all about his lisp, Amaryllis.
Why should he get so mad at people?
Just because he lisps?
- That's just part of it.
- What's the rest of it?
Never mind, dear. It's just that he never talks very much.
Not even to you and your mother?
No, but we have to be very patient and understanding.
I'm patient.
I even say good night to him on the evening star.
Every night.
Good night, my Winthrop.
Good night.
Sleep tight.
And he never says anything to me.
Oh, darling, don't cry.
You'll have lots of time for sweethearts.
If not Winthrop, there'll be someone else.
Never! I'll end up an old maid like you.
I'm sorry, Miss Marian.
Can I play my cross-hand piece?
- May I-?
- May I play my cross-hand piece?
Yes, you may.
If a girl doesn't have a sweetheart...
...who's she going to say good night to on the evening star?
For the time being, you can just say:
"Good night...
...my someone."
You can put the name in when the right someone comes along.
All right. It's better than nothing.
Yes, it is.
Now you can play your cross-hand piece.
Good night, my someone
Good night, my love
Sleep tight, my someone
Sleep tight, my love
Our star is shining
Its brightest light
For good night, my love
For good night
Sweet dreams be yours, dear
If dreams there be
Sweet dreams
To carry you
Close to me
I wish they may
And I wish they might
Now good night, my someone
Good night
True love can be whispered
From heart to heart
When lovers are parted, they say
But I must depend
On a wish and a star
As long as my heart
Doesn't know who you are
Sweet dreams be yours, dear
If dreams there be
Sweet dreams
To carry you close to me
I wish they may
And I wish they might
Now good night, my someone
Good night
Good night
Good night
O Columbia
The gem of the ocean
The home of the brave and the free
The shrine of each patriot's devotion
A world offers homage to thee
Thy mandates make heroes assemble
When liberty's form stands in view
Thy banners make tyranny tremble
When borne by the red, white and blue
When borne by the red, white and blue
When borne by the red, white and blue
Thy banners make tyranny tremble
When borne by the red, white and blue
I'm sure we're all grateful to my wife...
...Eulalie Mackecknie Shinn, for leading the singing.
And to Ethel Toffelmier...
...our fine player piano player...
...piano.
As mayor of River City...
...I welcome you River Citi-zeeans...
...to the Fourth of July exercises set up indoors here in Madison Gymnasium...
...account the weather being so chancy.
Fourscore-
Fourscore-
Ah.
The members of the school board will now present a patriotic tableau.
Oh. Oh. The members of the school board will not present a patriotic tableau.
Oh.
Some disagreement about costumes,
I suppose.
Instead the Wa Tan Ye girls...
...of the local wigwam of Hiawatha...
...will present a spectacle. My wife.
In which my wife, Eulalie Mackecknie
Shinn, will take a leading part.
I will now count to 20 in the Indian tongue.
Ah! I'm shot! Ho-ho!
Who set off that firecracker?
Tommy Djilas did it. Tommy did it!
Yes, Tommy Djilas.
Tommy Djilas, I wouldn't leave if I were you.
Mrs. Shinn...
...will recover.
No thanks to a certain young ruffian who is a disgrace to our city.
Fourscore...
...and seven years ago our-
The Paine's Fireworks Spectacle,
"Last Days of Pomp-ee-eye"...
...will take place at 9: 30, providing it isn't raining.
It'll be over at the Madison Picnic Park in the far meadow.
- Across the creek from the pest house.
- What's all this talk about rain?
The Gazette predicted fair!
That's why we prepared for a storm.
My paper's accurate most of the time, Jacey.
I wouldn't last long in the banking business...
...being accurate most of the time.
Will members of the school board stop bickering in public?
Never mind!
Fourscore-
- We heard there's a pool table in town!
- That's what I heard.
Just a minute!
- Is it a pool table or isn't it?
Allow me to get on with the exercises.
We don't want any more exercises until we get this pool table matter settled.
Let's protect our children!
We've got to protect our children!
Resist sin and corruption!
Resist sin and corruption!
Let's smite that devil and keep our young boys pure!
Pure boys!
Folks, listen.
May I have your attention, please?
Attention, please.
I can deal with the trouble, friends
With a wave of my hand, this very hand!
Please observe me if you will
I'm Professor Harold Hill
And I'm here to organize
The River City Boys Band
Oh, think, my friends
How can any pool table
Ever hope to compete
With a gold trombone?
Remember, my friends
What a handful of trumpet players
Did to the famous
Fabled walls of Jericho
Oh billiard parlor walls
Come a-tumbling down
Well, a band'll do it, my friends
Oh, yes, I said a boys' band.
Do you hear me?
I said River City got
To have a boys' band
And I mean she needs it today
Well, Professor Harold Hill's on hand
River City's going to have her boys' band
As sure as the Lord made little green apples.
And that band's going to be in uniform:
Johnny, Willy, Teddy, Fred!
You'll see the glitter of crashing cymbals...
...and hear the thunder of rolling drums and the shimmer of trumpets. Tam-tada!
And you'll feel something akin to the electric thrill I once enjoyed...
...when Gilmore...
...Pat Conway, the great Creatore...
...W. C. Handy...
...and John Philip Sousa...
...all came to town on the very same historic day!
76 trombones led the big parade
With 110 cornets close at hand
They were followed by rows and rows
Of the finest virtuosos
The cream of every famous band
76 trombones caught the morning sun
With 110 cornets right behind
There were more than a thousand reeds
Springing up like weeds
There were horns
Of every shape and kind
There were copper-bottom timpani
In horse platoons
Thundering, thundering
All along the way
Double bell euphoniums
And big bassoons
Each bassoon
Having his big fat say
There were 50 mounted cannon
In the battery
Thundering, thundering
Louder than before
Clarinets of every size
And trumpeters who'd improvise
A full octave higher than the score
Whoo!
76 trombones hit the counterpoint
While 110 cornets blazed away
To the rhythm of Hark! Hark! Hark!
All the kids began to march
And they're marching still right today
There ain't nothing like a brass band to stir a fella up.
When I hear them trombones...
It's them peck horns that really does it.
I bet you Estherville ain't got anything like it.
Or even Des Moines.
I'll stake my River City band against any town west of Chicago.
What band?
Honestly! A bunch of grown men.
Along comes this fly-by-night salesman and you're all taken in.
She's right.
The man's a by-God spellbinder!
I haven't seen people so excited since
Frank Gotch and Strangler Lewis...
...lay on the mat for three and a half hours without moving a muscle.
Oh, but that was exciting!
Never mind!
Men, this calls for emergency action.
I want that man's credentials.
Grab that hoodlum!
He almost blew up Mrs. Shinn.
Great honk! Let me go!
Much obliged.
Have to make an example of this one.
Everything the ringleader does the gang does.
You wild kid, you!
Hanging around my oldest girl.
His father is one of them Nithelanians.
- You wild kid, you!
- What'd I do?
- Tagging after my oldest girl.
- I wasn't either tagging.
Don't contradict me!
We was just walking together.
Great honk!
Watch your phraseology. I know what you was doing. Little Grade seen you.
Stay away from my oldest or you'll hear from me till who-laid-the-rails.
I'll talk to you Monday morning about this band thing. Here in City Hall.
Ten o'clock sharp.
Now, constable!
I'll be responsible for him.
This kid's tough. Probably got his gang waiting around the corner.
I'll be careful.
Tommy, I want to talk to you about the band.
Gee, professor, that's for the little kids.
No, not about playing in the band.
Aren't you mechanically minded?
Did you ever do anything with...
...perpetual motion?
Yeah. I nearly had it a couple times.
You did? Well, you're my man.
Do you realize no one has ever invented a music holder...
...for a marching piccolo player?
There's no place to hang the music.
Great honk! Where can I get wire?
Look in your cellar.
That's where people keep wire.
Oh, Tommy.
Yes, sir?
Constable, I'll show you how to break up a gang.
Young lady!
Miss, what's your name?
Zaneeta.
I didn't have any idea you was beckoning to me. Ye gods!
- Do you know Tommy Djilas?
- Well-
Now, Tommy, this is Zaneeta.
Escort the young lady home.
Only I'm not going home.
I have to go to the library.
Ye gods!
Then escort the young lady home by way of the library, uh-huh...
...by way of the Candy Kitchen.
Yes, sir.
Do I have to?
Oh, you have to.
Yes, sir!
Ye gods!
Professor.
You're a bright young fella, only you made a couple mistakes.
- Oh?
- The mayor owns that billiard parlor...
...and that new pool table.
You don't say?
What was my other mistake?
That Zaneeta.
She's the mayor's oldest girl.
Good evening, ladies.
Just a minute, Professor Hill.
Sorry, we're the school board and we need your credentials.
- Academic certificates.
- Nothing of the kind!
We need letters and papers.
Make him put up a bond.
What am I hearing?
You, sir.
Say "ice cream"
- Ice cream. But I don't sing-
- Talk, then.
Down here
Ice cream
Ice cream.
Talk slow
Ice cream
You see? Singing is just...
Sustained talking
Now you, sir.
Ice cream
Now you, sir.
Now you, sir!
Ice cream
From now on you won't see one of those men without the other three.
Professor, you're wrong.
Why, they've hated each other for 15 years.
Ice cream
Ice cream
Ice cream
Go ahead, Mom.
I'll be there in a minute.
How can there be
Any sin in sincere?
Where is the good in goodbye?
Your apprehensions confuse me, dear.
Puzzle and mystify
Tell me
What can be fair
In farewell, dear?
Why one single star shines above?
How can there be any sin in
Sincere?
Aren't we sincerely
In love?
- I don't suppose you live alone or anything-
- No.
- I have wonderful caramels at the hotel-
- Mr. Hill.
Oh, please, please!
Professor Hill.
Professor? Of what?
What college gives a degree for accosting women...
...like a rowdy at a public dance hall?
I wouldn't know.
I'm a Conservatory man.
Gary, Indiana.
Gold Medal class of '05.
Even should that happen to be true, Mr. Hill...
...I am not as easily mesmerized as some people in town.
It's only fair to tell you
I'm not impressed by your credentials...
...which I've not seen, nor your manners, which I have!
It's a golden key, as it were.
Your key to the magic world of music.
None of our family's ever been what you'd call musical.
Madam, that you do not know.
Now the main thing is imagination and proper instruction. Ah!
You, young man, repeat after me.
I love music, Mommy
I love music, Mommy
Now you, young man.
Me too, Mommy
Me too, Mommy
Madam, it's amazing!
Two members of the same family with absolutely perfect pitch.
Sign here, madam.
You sure cut a swath down at the high school yesterday.
- Yeah.
- When you talked about them trombones...
...you looked just like you used to back in Joplin.
Joplin?
Yeah, when you used to imitate that
Italian bandleader in the park.
Oh, yeah.
Ra ta ta ta ta ta
Ram ta ra ta ram
That's kid stuff.
I'm in rare form these days, son.
Just keep your eye on me for the next four weeks.
Four weeks? You used to get the instruments in 10 days.
I still do, but it takes four weeks for the uniforms.
Uniforms? You've added uniforms?
Uniforms and instruction books.
Why warm up if you're not going to pitch?
You can't pass yourself off as a music professor. You can't read music.
I have a revolutionary new method, the Think System.
You don't bother with notes.
My boy...
...someday reading music is going to be absolutely obsolete.
I hope it's soon. In four weeks these people will want to hear music.
But when the uniforms arrive they forget everything else.
At least long enough for me to collect and leave.
This is a refined operation, son.
I've got it timed down to the wave of the brakeman's hand...
...on the last train out of town.
- Good evening, ladies.
- Good evening, ladies.
Good evening, ladies.
Oh.
Professor Hill...
...we're all agog.
Oh, yes, simply agog!
- On the qui vive.
- Everyone's excited about the band.
I'm Ethel Toffelmier, the pianola girl.
And this is Avis Grubb.
- How do you do?
- And Mrs. Hicks.
- Hello.
- And Mrs. Squires.
And, of course, you've met
Eulalie Mackecknie Shinn.
- Our mayor's wife.
- Yes, indeed.
Oh, yes.
Isn't it exciting, Eulalie?
I couldn't say.
Oh, no, I could not say.
I could not say at this time.
My husband will wish to investigate,
I'm sure.
And naturally I'm reticent.
Oh, yes. I'm reticent.
Yes, of course.
I understand, Mrs. Shinn.
But part of my music plans include a committee on the dance.
And I was thinking-
Do that again, Mrs. Shinn.
Do what? What did I do?
Your foot, the way you just raised it.
Oh, well, I have a bunion there that bothers me.
What grace!
Oh, Mr. Hill.
What natural flow of rhythm!
Oh, Mr. Hill.
What expression of line and movement!
You must accept chairmanship...
...of the ladies' auxiliary for the classic dance. Mustn't she, ladies?
Mrs. Shinn, your every move bespeaks Delsarte.
Will you? Will you?
Say yes, Mrs. Shinn.
Well, I-
That is-
Dancing? Well!
Then you accept?
Indeed! And I'd like to say-
Thank you, Mrs. Shinn.
Oh...
Now, the young lady who teaches the piano.
Marian Paroo, I believe.
Oh!
After all, she is the librarian.
She must've picked him out the first crack out of the box.
Talking up to a man like that.
He wouldn't talk about her if she didn't try turkey-talking to him.
Ought to take her ticket and punch it for her.
Picked her out first crack like a cheap jack.
Not much pick to her.
- Pick a little, talk a lot.
- Pick a little, talk a little.
- Cheep, cheep, cheep.
- Talk a lot, pick a little more.
Pick a little, talk a little
Cheep, cheep, cheep
Talk a lot pick, a little more.
Pick a little, talk a little
Pick a little, talk a little
Talk a lot, pick a little more
Her kind of woman doesn't belong on any committee.
Of course, I shouldn't tell you this, but she advocates dirty books.
- Dirty books?
- Chaucer.
Rabelais.
Balzac!
The worst thing-
I shouldn't tell you this-
- I'll tell.
- The man lived on my street.
- Let me tell.
- No, I'll tell.
She made brazen overtures to a man who never had a friend...
...till she came here.
- Old miser Madison.
- Miser Madison?
- Miser-
- Madison.
Madison Picnic Park? Madison Gymnasium?
Madison Hospital? That miser Madison?
Exactly! Who did he think he was, anyway?
I should say!
The showoff!
He gave the town the library too.
That's just it. When he died he left the library to the city.
But he left all the books to her.
She was seen going and coming from his place.
Oh, yes! That woman made...
Brazen overtures
With a gild-edge guarantee
She had a golden glint in her eye
And a silver voice
With a counterfeit ring
Just melt her down and you'll reveal
A lump of lead as cold as steel here
Where woman's heart should be!
He left River City
The library building
But he left all the books to her
Chaucer.
Rabelais.
Balzac!
Just a minute here, professor.
Sorry. We need your credentials.
Certainly, gentlemen. I have just what you want over at my hotel.
Please come with me.
Good night, ladies!
Good night, ladies
Good night, ladies
Good night, ladies
We're going to leave you now
Farewell, ladies
Farewell, ladies
Farewell, ladies
We're going
To leave you now
Can I visit the horses?
- "May l"?
- May I visit the horses?
It's not visiting hours, but all right.
What a beautiful evening.
Not bad at all for a little place like River City, lowa.
Come to the boarding house.
We got chicken croquettes tonight.
No, I'm not thinking about food.
Going to line yourself up a little canoodling?
No, I got something to look up at the library.
From what I've heard...
Let me fix you up with
Myrtle Toffelmier, Ethel's sister.
Real nice girl.
Teaches Sunday school.
No wide-eyed, eager, wholesome, innocent Sunday school teacher for me.
That kind of gal spins webs no spider ever- Listen, boy.
A gal who trades on all that purity
Merely wants to trade
My independence for her security
The only affirmative she will file
Refers to marching down the aisle
No golden glorious gleaming
Pristine goddess
No, sir
For no Diana do I play faun
I can tell you that right now
I snarl, I hiss
How can ignorance be compared to bliss?
I spark, I fizz
For the lady who knows what time it is
I cheer and I rave
For the virtue I'm too late to save
The sadder but wiser girl for me
No bright-eyed blushing breathless
Baby-doll baby
No, sir
That kind of child ties knots
No sailor ever knew
I prefer to take a chance
On a more adult romance
No dewy young miss who keeps resisting
All the time she keeps insisting
No wide-eyed wholesome innocent female
No, sir!
Why, she's the fisherman
I'm the fish, you see
I flinch, I shy
When the lass with
The delicate air goes by
I smile, I grin
When the gal with a touch of sin
Walks in
I hope and I pray
For a Hester to win just one more "A"
The sadder but wiser girl's
The girl for me
The sadder but wiser girl for me
It's all right.
I know everything and it makes no difference.
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Mr. Madison.
You were probably very young.
Anyone can make a mistake.
What?
No apologies. No explanations.
You see, I'll only be in town a short while...
...and the sadder but wiser girl for me.
Would you please make your selection and leave?
I have.
- What do you want to take out?
- The librarian.
Shh.
Quiet, please.
The librarian.
You're not listening, Marian.
Look.
Marian
Marbles.
Six steelies, eight aggies, a dozen peewees...
...and one big glassie with an American flag in the middle.
- I think I'll drop them.
- No!
Shh.
Madam librarian
Oh, what can I do, my dear
To catch your ear?
I love you madly, madly
Madam Librarian
Marian
Heaven help us
If the library caught on fire
And the volunteer hose-brigade men
Had to whisper the news to
Marian
Madam librarian
Oh, what can I say, my dear
To make it clear?
I need you badly, badly
Madam Librarian
Marian
If I stumbled and I busted
My whatchamacallit
I could lie on your floor unnoticed
Till my body had turned to
Carrion
Madam librarian
Now in the moonlight
A man could sing it
In the moonlight
And a fellow would know
That his darling
Had heard every word of his song
With the moonlight
Helping along
But when I try in here
To tell you, dear
I love you madly, madly
Madam Librarian
Marian
It's a long-lost cause
I can never win
For the civilized world accepts
As unforgivable sin
Any talking out loud
With any librarian
Such as Marian
Madam librarian
Tommy!
Shh.
But when I try in here
To tell you, dear
I love you madly, madly
Madam Librarian
Marian
It's a long-lost cause
I can never win
For the civilized world accepts
As unforgivable sin
Any talking out loud
With any librarian
Such as
Ladies Dance Committee meets Tuesday night.
Marian
Marshmallow?
Madam librarian
- Hey, professor.
- Hello, Tommy.
- I think I got it.
- Yeah?
My music holder for a marching piccolo player.
- Oh.
- I still haven't worked out...
...a couple of minor flaws.
Even Edison doesn't always get it right the first time.
When you hold it tight enough to keep the music steady...
...you cut off the circulation and you can't wiggle your fingers.
And meanwhile...
...you could go blind.
I'd say it still needs a little work.
Like to check out a few prospects with me?
Hey.
You mean you're going in there?
I don't see any quarantine sign.
Gee, I got to hand it to you, professor.
See you later.
I hope.
Just a minute here.
Are you soliciting?
You haven't got a license.
Why, no, Mr. Mayor.
Mr. Mayor, I collect doorbells.
And this specimen has an unusual tone quality-
Flattery will not avail you.
Soliciting is statutory in this county.
Malfeasance without a permit.
Why haven't you been over at City Hall?
- I must have just missed you.
- None of your alibis!
- Your hand. Isn't that amazing?
- Hmm?
What? What?
That spread of the little finger.
It's hereditary.
- It is? What does that mean?
- Mm.
It means your son's little finger...
...is perfectly situated for the spit valve on a flugelhorn.
- Is that good?
- Good?
It means America finally has an artist who can...
...flugel the "Minute Waltz" in 50 seconds.
- How can I get one of those horns?
- Sign here.
Yes, sir.
Fine, fine!
That'll be 17 dollars import fee.
Just think, I could've missed this whole thing.
My son could've-
I haven't got any son!
Oh, George.
I never had a son.
- I never said you did.
- What do you know?
I'd certainly know if I gave you a son.
- I'm not talking to you.
- Who are you talking to?
- Him.
- Who?
Never mind!
Zaneeta, call Dr. Pyne for your father.
Yes, my dear Mrs. Paroo, you must realize...
...that only one out of every 78 adults...
...has a ganglion that reaches the ligature clear down to the apex.
This automatically turns your entire face into an amazing embouchure.
I never had a sick day in my life, doctor.
Ah. Professor.
Professor! What shall I do for it?
No, you don't understand.
I'm trying to tell you, you have the facial characteristics...
...of a cornet virtuoso.
If your boy has that same firm chin...
...and those splendid cheek muscles, oh-ho-ho...
By George!
Not that he'd ever really be great.
Is that so?
And in the name of
St. Bridget, why not?
All of the really great cornet players were Irish.
O'Clark, O'Mendez, O'Klein...
But, professor, we are Irish.
No!
No, really? That clinches it.
Sign here, Madam.
Your boy was born to play the cornet.
Fine, fine!
That'll be 7 dollars earnest money.
Nothing more due until the opening of band practice.
Thank you. And I'll need your boy's measurements for his uniform.
His uniform?
- Oh, yes-
- Ah!
- Winthrop!
- Well, hello there, son.
Why, certainly, his uniform.
And there won't be a penny due until delivery.
Which gives him four weeks to enjoy, anticipate, imagine at no cost.
Never allow the demands of tomorrow...
...to interfere with the pleasures and excitements of today.
Would it have a-?
- A...
- A...
A stripe! Why, certainly, my boy!
A wide, red stripe down each side.
What do you think of that?
You'll have to excuse Winthrop.
We can't get him to say three words a day.
Not even to us.
If you can get him to play in that band...
...you'll have St. Michael's own way with you.
But if anybody can do it,
I bet you can. Heh-heh.
Thank you.
You've a gift of the blarney about you, no mistaking that.
- Where are you from, my boy?
- Gary, Indiana.
I knew it!
Where'd you say?
Gary, Indiana.
Gary Conservatory was my alma mater.
Was she now?
Yes, indeed.
Gold Medal Class of '05.
Gary, Indiana
What a wonderful name!
Named for Elbert Gary
Of judiciary fame
Gary, Indiana
As a Shakespeare would say
Trips along softly
On the tongue this way
Gary, Indiana
Gary, Indiana
Gary, Indiana
Let me say it once again
Gary, Indiana
Gary, Indiana
Gary, Indiana
That's the town that knew me when
Now if you'd like to have
A logical explanation
How I happened on
This elegant syncopation
I will say without
A moment of hesitation
There is just one place
That can light my face
Gary, Indiana
Gary, Indiana
Not Louisiana
Paris, France
New York or Rome
But Gary, Indiana
Gary, Indiana
Gary, Indiana
My home sweet home
Gary, Indiana

- Ah!
- Whoa!
Mama!
How do you do, Miss Paroo?
How do you do?
Of course, Paroo!
I thought the name sounded familiar.
- I've been trying to see you.
- He wants to put Winthrop in the band.
We're not interested.
But Marian dear, the boy might have his father's musical gift.
He does have my ganglion, you know.
Your husband is musical?
I'd like to talk to him.
Do you always burst into people's homes prying into personal affairs?
We're not interested.
Marian!
There's one for and one against.
Now, why not let the boy's father decide?
The boy's father is dead.
Anything else?
I am sorry.
But all the more reason he should have this!
My brother is an unhappy child who can't understand why his father was taken away.
Would you care to explain it to him?
He's been brooding for two years.
And as for your musical tricks, go into business with a carnival man...
...who sells painted watches and glass diamond rings!
Musical tricks? Now, Miss Paroo!
I have a feeling she likes the idea.
A little cautious, but I admire that in a woman.
I'll be back later in the week.
I do hope you'll excuse Marian.
She's not really-
Please, don't you worry about a thing.
I'm sure that at heart, she's as lovely as yourself.
Good day to you, Widow Paroo.
- Has he gone?
- He has. And I hope not forever.
Darling, don't you ever think of your future?
Now, Mama, a girl's future doesn't depend on encouraging...
...every fast-talking, self-centered...
...woman-chasing traveling man who comes to town.
All right, darling. All right.
Only it's a well-known principle that if you keep the flint in one drawer...
...and the steel in the other you'll never strike a fire.
- Mama!
- A fine-looking man.
And educated.

That he claims his commodity is music does not, in this case, impress me.
Nor does anything else about him.
I give up.
At your age, if you don't mind my asking, what are you waiting for?
Not for Ed Griner, who backs me into the history shelf...
...every time he's in the library.
He does?
Or Ed Gammage who has the buggy with the removable back seat.
If you're waiting for a knight in shining white armor to come riding up the street...
I'm not waiting for that either.
Then what are you waiting for?
Marian Paroo, if you don't mind my asking...
...don't you ever think about being in love?
Being in love?
Being in love
Used to be my favorite dream
Oh, yes
I've been in love
More than anybody else has
I guess
My first love
Heroically ran the streetcar
I tingled at every clang-clang
Next I fell for the principal
But, oh, that teacher who sang
"In the Gloaming"
Knee-deep in love
What a lovely dream
And yet somehow
Me deep in love's
Only half of what
I'm longing for now
I still love my being
In love with someone
But tell me why couldn't there be
Somebody being in love
With me?
All I want is a plain man
All I want is a modest man
A quiet man
A gentle man
A straightforward and honest man
To sit with me
In a cottage somewhere
In the state of lowa
And I would like him to be
More interested in me
Than he is in himself
And more interested in us
Than in me
And if occasionally he'd ponder
What makes Shakespeare
And Beethoven great
Him I could love till I die
Him I could love
Till I die
Being in love
What a lovely dream
And yet
Somehow
Being in love's
Only half of what
I'm longing for now
And so then
Tonight I'll be in there dreaming
And hoping that someday there'll be
Just once!
Somebody being in love
With me
Please, Zaneeta.
I'm supposed to be parallel reading.
Just to the Candy Kitchen.
With Mama and Papa shopping on Center Street?
Ye gods!
Meet me after supper.
I can't. It's Epworth League tonight.
- Meet you where?
- The footbridge.
See? Isn't that what I said?
Last time the lumberyard, now the footbridge.
Where will we meet after that?
The black hole of Calcutta? Ye gods!
Shh.
It's indecent to meet boys at the footbridge.
First thing after supper?
All right.
- Ye gods!
- Shh.
The Wells Fargo wagon!
The Wells Fargo wagon?
Oh-ho, the Wells Fargo wagon
Is a-coming down the street
Oh, please let it be for me
Oh-ho, the Wells Fargo wagon
Is a-coming down the street
I wish, I wish I knew what it could be
I got a box of maple sugar
On my birthday
In March I got a gray mackinaw
And once I got some grapefruit
From Tampa
Montgomery Ward sent me a bathtub
And a crosscut saw
- Is that the first thing I said or not?
- Yes, George.
Yes, the very first thing I said, or I'll eat hay with the horse.
Get his credentials, I said...
...morning of July 4th...
...19 and 12.
Now look! My wife is off dancing at any and all hours...
...instead of in the home.
And the school board is singing instead of tending to city matters.
My oldest girl is boodling around with some wild kid.
And my business's fell off so far
I can't find the balance sheet.
I found something interesting in this book about Professor Hill's alma mater.
I know all about it.
It's all I can get out of him.
Gary Conservatory, class of '05.
If you take time to read it, you wouldn't have to look any further.
It's on page-
Papa, the Wells Fargo wagon is coming this way.
The Wells Fargo wagon?
It could be the band instruments!
- The band instruments?
- But Mayor Shinn!
Later, later.
Oh-ho, the Wells Fargo wagon
Is a-coming now
Is it the prepaid surprise or C. O. D.?
It could be curtains
- Or dishes
- Or a double boiler
- Or it could be
Yes, it could be
Yes, you're right
It surely could be
- Something special
Something very, very special now
Just for me
Oh-ho, the Wells Fargo wagon
Is a-coming down the street
Oh, don't let him pass my door
Oh-ho, the Wells Fargo wagon
Is a-coming down the street
I wish I knew what he was coming for
I got some salmon from Seattle
Last September
And I expect a new rocking chair
I hope I get my raisins from Fresno
The D. A. R. Have sent a cannon
For the courthouse square
Oh-ho, the Wells Fargo wagon
Is a-coming now
I don't know how I can ever
Wait to see
It could be something
For thomeone who is
No relation
But it could be
Something special
Just for me
Oh-ho, the Wells Fargo wagon
Is a-coming
Oh-ho, the Wells Fargo wagon
Is a-coming
Oh-ho, the Wells Fargo wagon
Don't you dare to make a stop
Until you stop
For me
Here you are, Winthrop.
My cornet!
Gee, thanks, professor.
Isn't this the most scrumptious solid gold thing you ever saw?
I never thought I'd ever see anything...
...so scrumptious as this solid gold thing. Oh, sister!
Remember, men!
Stay off the streets...
...pay attention to your instruments, and think about the "Minuet in G."

Yes.
And now, Miss Marian, about that book-
George, come along.
Tern pus fug it.
You watch your phraseology!
Go along, if you want. I must get something from the librarian.
About that book...

- All together now.
- Professor.
I can't even think out how to hold the horn right.
There's these little spigots on the side...
...but which one's which?
Aha-ha. Experimentation!
Trial and error!
- Could you show me, professor?
- Oh.
I'll tell you what the great Giuseppe Creatore...
...said to me once under like circumstances.
"Professor Hill," he said,
"that is your instrument.
Hold onto it.
Cherish it.
Don't let anybody else play it.
Not even me.
Not even you.
Until you feel you're ready."
- But-
- Ah-ah-ah-ah.
Yes, sir.
All together now.

- Right with you.
Ye gods!
Great honk!
If there's anything you don't see there, ask for it.
Oh. Professor Hill, I didn't see you.
May I join you?
Well, really, I-
Where? They were seen!
Red-handed! Caught in the act!
- Take your hands off my daughter!
- Papa!
Mr. Shinn, Your Honor, your daughter and I are going steady behind your back.
- Why, you-!
- We'd rather do it in front of your back.
Do what?
- Well, uh-
- Never mind!
Zaneeta's scared of you but I'm not.
I should think you'd hate to have your daughter scared of you. Great honk!
I'll warn you once more:
If you ever touch my daughter...
...I'll horsewhip you till hell won't have it!
Now, George!
Not one poop out of you, Madam.
I think he means "peep."
Yeah.
Now get out of this public emporium!
I got as much right in a public emporium as anybody!
How do you get any right around here?
Aiding and abetting the swindling activities of this cymbal salesman!
You know what I see written all over you? Reform school!
Now get out!
Get out, you wild kid!
Papa, please!
It's Capulets like you make blood in the marketplace. Ye gods!
You watch your phraseology, young woman!
Go home.
Taking up with wild kids from the wrong side of town!
If I could make you understand-
Well, you can't!
And thanks for the buggy ride.
I read that book you gave me from cover to cover...
...and didn't find a thing.
Mr. Mayor, please-
I'll settle your hash...
...as soon as I get these premises off my oldest girl.
- Yes.
- But in the meantime...
...I'm vouching for Tommy Djilas.
He has the confidence of every kid in town.
You'll be waiting to shake his hand...
...when our band plays its first concert.
By that time, my fine young feathered...
...my feathered young, my feathered fine-
Never mind!
Oliver! Jacey! Ewart! Olin!
I want that man's references and I want them tonight.
He's slipperier than a Mississippi... sturgeon.
I think Mayor Shinn behaved abominably.
And it was wonderful of you, sticking up for Tommy Djilas.
- Oh, that was nothing.
- Yes, it was.
A man can't go back on his principles because personal risk is involved.
What does the poet say?
A coward dies 1000 deaths.
A brave man...
...only 500.
- Something like that.
- Thank you.
Get his papers or get him in jail!
I couldn't make myself clearer...
...if I was a buttonhook in well water.
I want to talk to you about Winthrop's cornet.
A beautiful instrument.
Hammered brass, mother-of-pearl keys.
But he never touches it. He said you told him it wasn't necessary.
You must understand-
Something about a "Think System."
He says if he thinks the "Minuet in G" he can play it.
I admit it's still in the experimental stages.
To a seasoned professional like yourself it may seem ludicrous.
You mustn't say that.
- I mustn't?
- No.
Throughout history the true originator is always laughed at.
I hope you don't class me with those small minds who ridiculed-
- Galileo.
- Yes, and his conception of the heavens.
Or Fulton.
- Yes. Or Columbus.
- And his conception of the egg-
Globe!
The one thing one must remember, no matter who one is...
...or what one is working for...
...one can do anything if one puts one's mind to it.
Miss Marian...
...if one could only tell you how much you've done for one.
I would deem it a great privilege to talk with you again.
Well, all I said-
May one call upon you some evening?
Any night this week.
Good evening, gentlemen.
Sorry, professor, but we got our orders.
We all been deputized.
Yes, yes, yes.
Congratulations. Now let me see.
Every time I try to give you those credentials...
...you always try to change the subject somehow.
It's like a conspiracy.
I'll go up in my room and get them.
- Sorry! Afraid I'll have to go with you.
- Oh, yes.
Let's see if I have my key.
What's this?
What do you know?
A testimonial from the only female bassoonist...
...on the Redpath Circuit.
Madame Rini.
That's her stage name.
Actually she's from Moline.
- Lida Rose Quackenbush.
- Can I see that?
You never forget the name.
Lida Rose.
- Just like in the old song.
- None of that now!
Lida Rose
I'm home again, Rose
To get the
Sun back

I'm home again, Rose
About a thousand kisses shy

At the least suggestion
I'll pop the question

I'm home again, Rose
Without a sweetheart to my name
Lida Rose
How everyone knows
That I am hoping you're the same
So here is my love song
Not fancy or fine
Lida Rose
Oh, won't you be mine?
Lida Rose, oh, Lida Rose
Oh, Lida Rose
Dream of now
Dream of then
Dream of a love song
That might have been
Do I love you?
Oh, yes, I love you
And I'll bravely tell you
But only when you dream again
Sweet and low
Sweet and low
How sweet that memory
How long ago?
Forever?
Oh, yes, forever
Will I ever tell you?
No
Lida Rose, oh, Lida Rose, oh
Lida Rose, I'm home again, Rose
To get the sun back in the sky
Lida Rose, I'm home again, Rose
About a thousand kisses shy
Ding

Lida Rose, oh, won't you be mine?
Lida Rose, oh, Lida Rose
Oh, Lida Rose
Will you ever stop arguing with yourself?
Will you ever tell him?
Won't you ever tell him? Yes! No!
Fiddlesticks! Open your mouth and let it come out.
- Now, Mama-
- Now, nothing.
If he ever calls again, you see him alone...
...and if you haven't the gumption to tell him how you feel-
Tell him?
- Nothing wrong with a ladylike hint.
Ah! What's that thing you got?
It's a genuine Hercules combination pocketknife and tool kit...
...with a solid stag handle and six sturdy steel blades.
Blessed Martin of Tours!
One spear blade, one sheep's foot blade, one small pen blade...
...a swagging awl, a file and a combination tack puller and screwdriver.
Where'd you pick up that horrible weapon?
It was a present.
From Harold.
- Professor Hill?
- Uh-huh.
He says if I stick around River City...
...I better learn to whittle and spit.
I got the spitting down pretty good.
Winthrop, what do you and Harold find to talk about?
Sometimes we talk business and sometimes just plain talk.
He talks about his hometown,
Gary, Indiana.
He said he'd take me there someday.
Isn't that nice?
He taught me a song about it with hardly any "S"s in it.

My home sweet home
All right, enough of that.
Come along, now.
You still have to change for the sociable.
Do the Shinns live around here somewhere?
The Shinn home is on East Elm.
This is West Elm.
Mm, criminy.
Oh. I see you're the piano teacher here in town.
You must know about this fellow Hill forming a boys' band here.
Don't let that worry you no more.
I got the goods on him in spades.
That swindling, two-bit thimblerigger!
That's why I got to see Shinn.
I'm just passing through...
...and number 8 only makes a 15-minute water stop and-
Ooh.
I wish it was 20.
Sure could concentrate five minutes on you, girlie-girl.
Who are you?
Name's Charlie Cowell.
Anvil salesman.
But now I've got heavier things on my mind.
I've got to protect the good name of the traveling fraternity from Hill.
Mr. Cowell, you're making a big mistake.
Mistake, my old lady's corset cover!
He's been the raspberry seed...
...in my wisdom tooth just long enough.
He spoiled Illinois for me.
But he won't spoil lowa.
You're a music teacher.
You didn't see through him?
- He's no more professor-
- I know all about that.
Bandleaders are always called professor.
It's an academic courtesy.
He's a fine director-
Now wait a minute!
Fine director?
Tell me, you heard one note of music from any band?
Well, no, but-
But nothing, girlie-girl.
He never formed a band in his life.
And you think he ever will?
Not on your previous existence!
Just listen a minute-
I'd like to.
I'd like to do more than that if I had the time.
Sure got the inclination.
But I got to leave this dynamite with somebody on the way to the depot.
Bye, girlie-girl. I'll see you next time I come through.
You'll never make that train at the depot. Catch it at the crossing.
I've got to leave word, and I can see you ain't the one to leave it with.
Wait a minute!
Mr. Cowell.
You don't know me very well yet.
Is that an invitation, girlie-girl?
No. I mean, I don't know you.
I'd need more time anyway.
What I mean is...
...as well as I'd like to.
Oh. There's no trouble there...
...girlie-girl!
I've never met a man...
...who sells anvils before.
It's really quite...
...different.
Takes a real salesman,
I can tell you that.
Anvils have a limited appeal, you know.
What am I doing?
If I miss that train, I'll lose my job.
And I got to leave word about Hill.
Leave word with me.
Not on your tintype, girlie-girl.
How do I know you'll deliver these letters?
Try me.
There's your train! Run for it!
You double-dealing-
Who do you think you're protecting?
That guy's got a gal in every county in Illinois...
...and he's taken it away from every one of them. That's 102 counties!
Not counting the piano teachers like you he cozies up to...
...just to keep your mouths shut!
Neither one of you have heard the last of me, girlie-girl!
I'll pop the question
Lida Rose, I'm home again, Rose
Without a sweetheart to my name
Good evening, Miss Marian
Lida Rose, how everyone knows
That I am hoping you're the same
Marian!
Marian dear, who was you talking-?
Why, Professor Hill!
Mrs. Paroo, the top of the evening!
Miss Marian.
You and Marian come up and set.
I've got some jelly on the stove.
There's no jelly on the stove.
Well, I'll put some on!
- Shall we "set," as your mother said?
- Really, I don't-
You did ask me to call. Remember?
Did I? I didn't mean anything.
I'm not suggesting your invitation inferred...
...anything but academic enlightenment.
The Think System.
I've been by your house to explain it to you...
...but there always seem to be people around.
Ladies mostly, I thought.
Yes. Mrs. Squires and several of the other ladies.
I'm glad.
I wouldn't want anyone beating my time.
"You wouldn't?"
"No, ma'am."
It's evidently not the convenient evening.
I'll see you at the sociable.
Professor Hill, is it true that you've had 100-?
- What I'm trying to say is-
- Yes?
I was wondering...
...how you developed the Think System.
The Think System?
Oh, the Think System!
It's quite simple, really.
It's as simple as whistling.
No one had to develop an elaborate technique for whistling.
You simply think the tune up here...
...and it comes out clearly here.
Now just suppose you try this yourself.
I'll take your word for it.
Why don't we all sit down?
Are all music teachers as dense as I am?
All music teachers?
I daresay you've met dozens.
Maybe even a hundred.
- Well-
- Are they all as fascinated as I...
...with the Think System?
Some more and some less.
One young lady had thought up the same system.
She showed me a few refinements.
I see.
Have I said something wrong?
Please don't let me keep you.
You must have more important things to do...
...than explain the Think System to me.
Nope, can't think of one.
Come, let's sit.
I must be very dull company for a man of your experience.
Now where'd you ever get an idea like that? Heh-heh.
One hears rumors about traveling salesmen.
Oh, now, you mustn't believe everything you hear.
After all, one even hears rumors about librarians.
I presume you're referring to Uncle Maddy?
- Uncle Maddy?
- Mr. Madison, my father's best friend.
No matter what they say, he left that library job to me...
...so Mother, Winthrop and I could have security.
Surely, you don't believe-
No, but that's just what I'm saying.
Why do you suppose people start rumors?
Narrow-mindedness, jealousy.
Jealousy mostly, I guess.
Exactly!
And jealousy mostly starts rumors about traveling salesmen.
What have you heard?
Oh.
Nothing about you personally.
It's just...
...you know, generally.
What have you heard generally?
Just that-
But of course!
It stands to reason that disappointment and jealousy can lead to-
Well, take you, for instance.
Your attentions to customers...
...and teachers might easily be misconstrued, mightn't they?
I mean now, honestly, mightn't they?
And as you say, if a salesman or somebody were jealous...
...they could be downright lies, now, couldn't they?
- What could?
- Rumors and things!
Of course!
It goes to show, you should never believe everything you hear!
I mean, if you just discuss things!
I'd be delighted to discuss...
...anything in the world with you.
But couldn't we do it sitting down?
You do sit?
Your knees bend and all?
We could sit on the steps, I suppose.
Or on the large hollow log over at the footbridge.
No, I couldn't do that.
I've never been to the footbridge with a man in my life.
Just to talk.
I have to dress for the sociable.
Then meet me there in 15 minutes.
No, I can't.
Please.
Some other time.
Maybe tomorrow.
Please.
Oh, my dear little librarian!
You pile up enough tomorrows and you'll collect...
...nothing but a lot of empty yesterdays.
I don't know about you...
...but I'd like to make today worth remembering.
Oh...
So would I.
The footbridge...
...15 minutes.
Fifteen minutes.
Mama!
- What?!
I told the professor I'd meet him at the footbridge in 15 minutes.
Glory be and the saints be praised!
- It works!
- What works?
I been using the Think System on you from the parlor.
Any of you people Mayor Shinn?
Please, you got to clear this area.
Mrs. Shinn wants to start the entertainment.
No, we want to dance.
Wait'll you see the new steps
Professor Hill taught us.
Mr. Washburn, my group is ready to perform.
- Start her out.
- Okay, what'll it be?
"The Shipoopi!"
Now a woman who'll kiss on the
Very first date is usually a hussy.
And a woman who'll kiss on the
Second time out is anything but fussy
But a woman who'll wait
Till the third time around
Head in the clouds
Feet on the ground
She's the girl he's glad he's found
She's his Shipoopi
Shipoopi, Shipoopi, Shipoopi
The girl who's hard to get
Shipoopi, Shipoopi, Shipoopi
But you can win her yet
Walk her once
Just to raise the curtain
Walk around twice
And you make for certain
Once more in the flower garden
She will never get sore
If you beg her pardon
Do re mi fa so la si do
Si la so fa mi re do
Squeeze her once
When she isn't looking
If you get a squeeze back
That's fancy cooking
Once more for a pepper-upper
She will never get sore
On her way to supper
Do re mi fa so la si do
Si do
Now little old Sal's a no-gal
As anyone could see
Look at her now, she's a go-gal
Who only goes for me
Squeeze her once
When she isn't looking
If you get a squeeze back
That's fancy cooking
Once more for a pepper-upper
She will never get sore
On her way to supper
Do re mi fa so la si do
Si do
Shipoopi, Shipoopi, Shipoopi
The girl who's hard to get
Shipoopi, Shipoopi,
Shipoopi
But you can win her yet
Shipoopi, Shipoopi, Shipoopi
The girl who's hard to get
Shipoopi, Shipoopi, Shipoopi
But you can win her yet
Hey, professor!
Show us some new steps!
Shipoopi, Shipoopi, Shipoopi
The girl who's hard to get
Shipoopi, Shipoopi, Shipoopi
But you can win her yet
You can win her yet
Shipoopi!
Professor Hill-
This is no place to talk.
You won't back down?
I'll come, but I promised
Mother and Winthrop...
...to have a plate of cream with them.
You go along, I'll meet you.
Fifteen minutes.
Fifteen minutes.
And now we arrive at the high-water mark...
...of the evening's festivities.
The River City Ladies'
Eurhythmic Dance Group...
...under the leadership of my wife...
...will give their interpretation of...
Psst.
Grecian urns!
Yes. Grecian urns.
Psst. Psst.
One Grecian urn.
Miss Marian, you're late.
- You said 15 minutes.
- Not that kind of late. I meant...
I'd say about...
...26 years late.
It took you all this time to get to the footbridge with a fella.
If you want to know the truth, it was almost longer.
- Oh?
- Halfway here...
...I nearly turned back.
I suppose I'm not the first person to discover...
...a girl doesn't think clearly under the spell of your salesmanship.
You surely don't think I've been trying to sell you anything?
Oh, no.
You've given me something.
That's why I had to come.
- I don't recall giving you-
- Yes.
Something beautiful.
That's why I came.
And I'm so glad.
Please don't be afraid
I expect too much more.
One can't expect a traveling salesman to stay put.
There've been many ports of call and there'll be many more.
Still, I can be grateful for what you've left behind.
For me.
Marian-
There were bells
On the hill
But I never heard them ringing
No, I never heard them at all
Till there was you
There were birds
In the sky
But I never saw them winging
No, I never saw them at all
Till there was you.
And there was music
And there were wonderful roses
They tell me
In sweet fragrant meadows
Of dawn
And dew
There was love
All around
But I never heard it singing
No, I never heard it at all
Till there was you
There was love
All around
But I never heard it singing
No, I never heard it at all
Till there was
You
Marian.
There's lots you don't know about me.
I'm not asking.
Excuse me.
I'm expecting a telegram from Rudi Friml.
This could be it.
Who's the salesman? Looks like she's selling and you're buying.
I have to keep her off balance.
She's as off balance as a catboat in a hurricane.
It's just until those uniforms arrive.
They're here and the kids are in them.
Tommy passed out the uniforms and collected most of the money.
Now he's pretending there's a band practice at the lumberyard.
- What time's the freight train go?
40 from the junction.
It isn't even 8: 30 yet.
You better cheese it now while you can!
I came up through the ranks on this skirmish.
I won't resign without my commission.
Now go on, beat it!
Never a peaceful moment in the music business.
Now where were we?
You were going to tell me what I don't know about you.
Yeah.
But we don't have to go into that right now.
Of course not.
We never have to go into that, Harold.
Madam Librarian, you are a lady from the ground up.
The librarian hasn't felt much like doing research lately.
But she did plenty of it when you first came here.
Oh.
About what?
Oh. About Professor Harold Hill...
...Gary Conservatory of Music,
Gold Medal Class of '05.
Harold...
...there wasn't any
Gary Conservatory in '05.
Well, there most cert-
The town wasn't even built until '06.
Walk me home.
I have to get something to draw around my shoulders.
You knew all the time.
I've known since three days after you came here.
I tore this out of the Indiana Journal.
I meant to use it against you.
Now I give it to you with all my heart.
But if you knew-
It's your sweet "Hello, dear"
That sets me up
And it's your "Got to go, dear"
That gets me down
It's you on my pillow
In all of my dreams
Till once more the morning-
Stop! Stop!
Stop! Stop, I tell you!
Listen to this man.
Why, you boneheaded, square-toed...
...tank town boobs!
I've been trying to tell you!
Can't you see this music fella's giving you the double shuffle!
He's putting the shake on you...
...taking out your eyeteeth while you look the other way.
What are you saying?
I'll tell you what I'm saying!
This burglar's in the bedroom while you're fiddling in the parlor!
Whose bedroom are the burglars fiddling in?
Quiet.
I'm talking about Harold Hill.
A shell worker.
A flimflammer!
An eighteen-karat thief!
You mean the music professor?
Music professor?
Not on your fireless cooker, mister!
Fellow that organized the band?
There ain't any band.
There ain't never been a band.
There ain't never going to be a band!
Unless you hunt this man down now like a mad dog...
...there won't be a Harold Hill either.
He'll be on his way to the state line.
I said all along, get his credentials, didn't I?
I got his credentials right here!
Well, what are we waiting for?
I want my money back.
I want his hide!
Find him and bring him to the school.
Roped and hogtied, if you have to.
And don't let him give you the slip.
All right, after him!
Have you seen Professor Hill?
Haven't been looking for him.
I'll only be a minute.
While 110 cornets played the air
Then I modestly took my place
As the one and only bass
And I oompahed up and down the square
Good night, my someone
Good night, my love
With 110 cornets right behind
Our star is shining
Its brightest light
There were horns of every shape and-
Sweet dreams be yours, dear
If dreams there be
While 110 cornets played the air
I wish I may
And I wish I might
Now good night
My someone
Good night.
He's not in there.
Try the livery stable!
Try the freight depot!
Let's go, Greg.
The flivver's in the alley, all cranked up!
They're onto you!
That anvil salesman...
...is running all over town spilling everything!
Come on!
Run, professor!
They're talking about tar and feathers.
I've looked all over for Winthrop.
He's run away.
Maybe he's in his room.
It's not often I'm at a loss for words-
It's all right.
Don't you know that?
You don't owe me a word, not a word.
Now hurry, please!
Greg!
He's not around here, folks!
Let's try by the creamery.
- Whoa. Hold on a minute, son.
- I'm not your son. Leave me go!
Not until I talk to you a minute.
I won't listen.
You wouldn't tell the truth anyway.
- I would too.
- Would not!
Tell you anything you want to know.
Can you lead a band?
No!
- Are you a big liar?
- Yes.
- Are you a dirty, rotten crook?
- Yes.
Then leave me go, you big liar!
You wanted the truth, didn't you?
I'm bigger than you, and you're getting it all.
So just stop wiggling.
Now...
There are two things you're entitled to know.
One, you're a wonderful kid.
I thought so from the first.
That's why I wanted you in the band...
...so you'd stop moping around and feeling sorry for yourself.
What band?
I always think there's a band, kid.
What's the other thing
I'm entitled to know?
That's none of your business, come to think of it.
I wish you never came to River City.
No, you don't, Winthrop.
Sister, you believe him?
I believe everything he ever said.
But he promised us!
I know what he promised us, and it all happened just like he said:
The lights, the colors, the cymbals and the flags.
Where was all that?
In the way every kid in town walked around all summer...
...and looked and acted.
Especially you.
And the parents too.
Does Mama wish he'd never come?
Well, you do, don't you?
No, Winthrop.
You'd better go, Harold. Please!
Go on, professor.
Hurry up.
I can't go, Winthrop.
Why not?
Well, for the first time in my life...
...I got my foot caught in the door.
There was love
All around
But I never heard it singing
No, I never heard it at all
Till there was you.
Greg!
Greg, they're here!
Run this way!
Go on, professor! That way, that way!
And always remember, fellow River City-zeeans...
...I did everything in my power to prevent this dire...
...happening from...
...happening.
Fourscore-
How will you get our money back?
That professor collected almost
$300 on uniforms just tonight.
I haven't seen a uniform or my boy either since just after supper.
He's a kidnapper!
That's a fine situation we have here!
Fourscore-
Just a minute!
Virtue has triumphed!
The sword of restibution...
...has cut down...
...Professor Harold Hill.
And if there are those, as I've heard...
...who are melting tar and plucking feathers...
...I will not say them nay!
I should think some of you could forget your everlasting lowa stubbornness...
...long enough to remember what this town was like before Harold Hill came.
Do you?
- Well, do you?
- Hold up, there!
And then after he came!
Suddenly there were things to do...
...and things to be proud of...
...and people to go out of your way for.
Surely some of you can be grateful for what this man has brought to us.
I'd think you'd want to admit it!
You're wasting a great deal of time!
If there's a person in this hall...
...who doesn't want this man
Hill tarred and feathered...
...let him, by God, stand up!
Eulalie, sit down!
And the rest of you, who are standing there like Shropshire sheep!
Maybe you can remember other things.
Like what you paid for uniforms...
...technical instruction books and band instruments.
With the understanding...
...your children would be taught to play in a band!
Well, where's the band?
Where's the band?!
Oh...
No, I couldn't!
Now, think, men.
Think!
That's my Barney!
That tuba's my Barney!
Wonderful, Barney.
That's Eddie! That's Eddie's clarinet!
Oh. Oh.
Linus!
Play to me, son!
Play to me!
Davey!
That's my Davey!
Oh!
76 trombones led the big parade
With 110 cornets close at hand
They were followed by rows and rows
Of the finest virtuosos
The cream of every famous band
76 trombones caught the morning sun
With 110 cornets right behind
There were more than a thousand reeds
Springing up like weeds
There were horns
Of every shape and kind
There were copper-bottom timpani
In horse platoons
Thundering, thundering
All along the way
Double bell euphoniums
And big bassoons
Each bassoon
Having his big fat say
There were 50 mounted cannon
In the battery
Thundering, thundering
Louder than before
Clarinets of every size
And trumpeters who'd improvise
A full octave higher than the score!
If their love's on skids,
treat your folks like kids
Or your family tree's gonna snap
So to make'em dig, first you gotta rig
What have you gotta rig?
The Parent Trap
If they lose that zing
and they just won't swing
Then the problem falls in your lap
When your folks are square,
then you must prepare
What have you gotta prepare?
The Parent Trap
To set the bait, recreate the date
The first time Cupid shot 'em
Get 'em under the moon,
play their favourite tune
- John!
- Marcia!
You got 'em!
Lead 'em back to love
with a velvet glove
'Cause they're much too old
for the strap
Straighten out the mess with togetherness
Togetherness!
The Parent Trap
John, they're playing our song.
Marcia, what fools we've been.
Straighten out their mess
with togetherness
Togetherness
Straighten out their mess
with togetherness
Togetherness!
The Parent Trap!
All right, girls! A to Ks over here.
A to Ks? No, dear, you're an R. Over with the P to Ss. Have we any X, Y, Zs here?
Here are your allergy pills.
One three times a day.
And your insect repellent and your poetry book.
- Thank you, Staimes.
- Have a good summer, Miss.
- Name?
- McKendrick, Sharon.
- 18 Belgrave Square, Boston?
- Yes.
My grandmother said my tent should be well ventilated.
Don't worry. You'll be ventilated.
Next girl.
No candy wrappers lying on the ground.
Always tidy.
Latrines over there. Mess hall up the hill.
McKendrick, you're in Arapahoe.
Follow me. Girls, wait here.
Come, McKendrick.
New arrival, girls. Name's McKendrick.
- Hi.
- The girls here will brief you.
Sure you'll be happy here.
See you after lunch.
- My name is Betsy. This is Ursula.
- How do you do. I'm Sharon.
You're in a good tent. Betsy's mother sends her candy bars every week.
- I can't eat candy.
- Why not?
My grandmother thinks it ruins my teeth.
Hi, Mary.
Come on. I'm starved.
- The nerve! Coming here with your face.
- What are you gonna do?
- Do? What on earth can I do, silly?
- I'd bite off her nose!
- Who's she?
- I never saw her before.
At this time, I want to say welcome to all our new arrivals.
Welcome to Camp Inch, new arrivals.
I am your supreme commander here and my name is...
Miss Inch.
Yes. Miss Inch.
I'd like, at this time, to introduce a visitor from the next hilltop over, from the Thunderhead Boys' Camp.
Chief Eaglewood.
Thank you, Miss Inch, and hello to all of you.
Looks like a crackerjack troop of girls there.
Why am I here?
Well, that's our little surprise.
Trooper Stafford, ten-shun!
Stand up, boy.
What a dream!
Little surprise for you, young ladies.
Saturday night, we're having a dance.
Quiet, girls.
We've asked the Thunderhead Boys' Camp to come over for the occasion.
We accept your invitation.
A word of warning. Watch your demerits.
Untidy little girls won't go to the dance, so keep those tents clean, your uniforms spanking fresh, and we'll all be one big happy family!
Oh, no.
What are you staring at?
Excuse me, but haven't you noticed?
We look like each other.
Turn your head. Let me see that profile.
That's who it is!
She's the spitting image of you-know-who.
- Who?
- Frankenstein!
Not wanted!
Those monsters! They gopher-trapped us!
- Morning, Miss Inch.
- Morning, Miss Grunecker.
- Where would you like to start?
- Why not start with tent Arapahoe?
I'm sure you'll find it shipshape.
Think of all that we could share
Let's get together every day
Every day and everywhere
And though we haven't got a lot
We could be sharing all we've got
Together...
What if we get some ants and dump them down her dress?
- Impractical.
- How do you find ants at night?
The three of them.
I'm so mad I could just spit.
Let's get together, yeah, yeah, yeah
Two is twice as nice as one
Let's get together right away
We'll be having twice the fun
And you can always count on me...
I got an idea. Come on.
Let's get together, yeah, yeah, yeah
- How do you like camp?
- It's OK, I guess.
I'm not coming back to this one.
They won't let you wear lipstick or perfume.
I feel naked without my lipstick.
- Where are you from?
- Monterey, California.
- That's great.
- You'd love California. I do.
- It's sort of marvellous, actually.
- It sounds great.
It's absolute fun living in California.
When I get from camp,
Dad takes me on a trek into the mountains.
Gee, that's great. Your mother lets you go?
I don't have a mother. Just Dad and me.
He's wonderful.
Besides, I know most everything about camping and wood lore.
We have a ball - just Daddy and me and Hecky.
- It's hot out here.
- Who's Hecky?
Our ranch foreman. He tells sensational stories. He used to be a rodeo rider.
- They've started the music again.
- I guess we oughta?
I love dancing. I could dance all night - especially with you, Wilfred.
- Where could she have done it?
- I don't know! I just went out...
Stay out of our tent from now on.
You vicious little wretch!
Stop it! Sharon, let go!
Stop it!
I've got a cake in my hands! Stop it.
You little wretches!
Congratulations.
In the history of our camp, that was the most infamous, the most revolting, the most disgusting display of hooliganism we have ever had.
Brawling in front of our guests.
And worst of all, sisters who should be setting a good example.
- We're not sisters.
- I've never seen her before.
- They are, aren't they?
- No, Ma'am. Just look-alikes.
An amazing resemblance.
I gather that you two girls don't get along together.
Have you ever heard of Gilbert and Sullivan?
Yes, Ma'am.
They were composers.
They wrote a memorable song called
"Let the Punishment Fit the Crime".
Let the punishment fit the crime.
Sharon McKendrick, we are waiting.
Girls, follow me.
Girls, that's enough of this nonsense!
Go back to your activities!
All right, young ladies.
In here.
Yes...
Yes.
Four weeks left and you'll spend them together.
Room together, eat together, play together.
You'll find a way to live with each other, or you'll punish yourselves far better than I ever could. Bye, girls.
It drives her crazy. I completely ignore her.
- Good!
- The Coventry treatment.
The silence will drive her out of her mind.
- My goodness! Hurry! Quick!
- I've got it!
Turn it down over there. Tight.
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.
Gosh! Look at this mess!
- Are any of them spoilt?
- It didn't do them any good.
Darn! Look at this one. It's ruined.
That's a shame. Who is he?
Are you kidding? Ricky Nelson.
Your boyfriend?
I wish he was!
You mean you never heard of him?
Where do you come from? Outer space?
No. I'm from Boston.
Oh... Boston.
- Where's your home?
- California.
I've seen movies of California. Is it nice?
Sensational. We got a ranch in Carmel.
I got a picture. You wanna see it?
That's the house.
The stables go off down there.
- How lovely.
- I got my own horse.
We've got a lake. You can fall out of the front door and go swimming any time.
- Who is this?
- My Dad. Isn't he dreamy?
He's very handsome. Is it cold in here?
I'm hot. Want a Fig Newton?
What's your pop like? Is he a friend or one of those busy types?
I don't have a father, actually.
Mummy and Daddy separated.
She never mentions him now.
It's scary the way nobody stays together these days.
- There'll be more divorces than marriages!
- Isn't it the truth?
- How old are you?
So am I. I can't wait till I'm 18.
I'll get my own car and go dancing till midnight.
- I'll be 14 November 12th.
- No kidding? That's my birthday too.
Isn't that peculiar? November 12th?
Hm-mm. Funny, isn't it?
Oh-oh. This one's full.
Hey, it's stopped raining!
- What is your mother like?
- I can't remember her.
- Did she die?
- Nope.
Busted up with Dad.
But she was fabulous, absolutely fabulous.
- How do you know?
- A picture on Daddy's desk.
But he caught me looking at it and it's gone now.
Do you want to come and get a popsicle with me?
How can you think of that at a time like this?
At a time like what?
Don't you feel it?
Don't you know what's happening?
Don't you find it peculiar that we're so alike and have the same birthday?
It's just one of those things, isn't it?
Will you come inside a minute, please?
Mother says I'm psychic. That I can sense when something odd is going to happen.
I always get goose bumps. Look.
So what?
I don't understand.
What are you doing with her picture?
It's my mother.
But it's my mother too.
Lunch.
You go. I'm not hungry.
- I didn't know what to say.
- I know. I didn't either.
Golly! Sisters!
You know what probably happened?
They must have quarrelled and parted, and just sort of bisected us - each taking one of us.
- Why do you suppose they separated?
- I don't know.
I can't imagine anyone not loving Mother.
She's divine.
What about Dad? He's a sensational person, as a friend and all.
The thing is that neither of them got married again.
- You see what that means?
- Not really.
In their innermost hearts, they must still be in love with each other.
Then why have they stayed separated?
That's how true love creates its beautiful agony.
All splendid lovers have dreadful times.
Pelléas and Mélisande,
Daphnis and Chloë.
History's jammed with stories of lovers parted by some silly thing.
- Oh, my goodness! Oh, boy! Oh, my gosh!
- What's the matter?
You want to meet Father and I'm dying to know Mother.
Well, what if?
It's so scary, but we might be able to pull it off.
Pull what off?
- Switch places.
- Switch?
We could do it. We're twins.
I want to know Mother.
Look! Now I'm getting goose bumps.
Me too.
There's more to it than just switching places.
- I believe fate brought us together.
- How so?
If we switched, they'd have to unswitch us.
Mother would bring me to California.
- They'd have to meet again.
- Face to face.
- Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
- Exactly.
Let's get to work.
It's amazing.
You should wear this to meet Dad.
This is gorgeous! I'm going to wear this one when I go to Boston. I adore it!
Susan, pay attention. The music room and library are on the first floor.
Your room is the second door on the second floor on the left.
The horse is Schotzli and the dog is Andromeda.
Verbena collects the dirty laundry on Monday... Sharon, pay attention!
But dirty socks are on Thursday.
My favourite food is chilli beans and you gotta chew gum because I do.
Flat A's. Remember, all your A's are flat.
Talk fast 'cause everybody talks fast.
But I never bite my nails!
Sharon, you gotta. I always chew mine.
Anyhow, Dad'll know.
Go on, bite 'em!
Can't. Shan't. Aunt. Hmm?
No. Cah-n't. Shah-n't. Aunt.
Cah-n't. Shah-n't. Aunt.
Oh, I can't wait till camp is over.
- Cah-n't wait.
- OK. I cah-n't wait.
- But, Daddy...
- You're not taking it home!
Oh, Daddy, you big meany!
I spent so much time trying to get him.
It's got to be done methodically.
Recollection and memory.
- Get her talking about how they met.
- Find out about that first date.
- Sharon!
- That's you.
Coming!
You must bring Mother to California.
Boston is no place to rekindle a romance.
Sharon McKendrick!
Goodbye, girls. Sharon McKendrick!
Your chauffeur's waiting, dear. Hurry.
The punishment was harsh, I know, but you've survived it and I hope you've both learned something.
- You'd be surprised, Miss Inch.
- Goodbye, Sharon. See you next summer.
Goodbye, Miss Inch... I cah-n't tell you how very much I've enjoyed my stay.
I shah-n't tell my aunt about the aunts... ants, nor the debutantes, shall I? Bye.
- What did you do to your hair?
- I cut it. It was too hot long.
Wait till your grandmother sees it.
Miss Lockness, Bettina...
Upstairs. Third door to the left.
What's her name?
- Here goes nothing.
- What?
...The white wine and... Do we have any more of the Louis St George?
We'd better have tickets for the ladies' wraps.
Rosa, I want all the gilt chairs in the music room.
- You asked me to remind you...
- Yes, yes.
Do see the maids keep quiet. They must empty the ashtrays without clinking.
- Yes...
- I want both Steinways at the north end.
- Have you checked the delivery?
- I'll see about it now.
- You're home from camp.
- Hello, Miss Lockness.
- Did you bring home all your underwear?
- It's in my luggage.
Probably full of germs.
What have you done to your hair?
- Do you like it?
- Wait till your grandmother sees it.
Who's that I hear out there?
Is that my little girl?
That tall gangly thing?
- Hi, Grandfather.
- Hello, sweetheart. Oh, my.
Let me look at you. Have you had?
- What's the matter, dear?
- I'm just happy to see you.
And I'm happy to see you too.
Your Grandpa missed you around here.
It was an awful...
Wait a minute. What are you doing?
- Making a memory.
- Making a memory?
Years from now, when I'm quite grown up,
I'll remember how Grandfather always smells of...
- ...tobacco and peppermint.
- Tobacco and peppermint!
I use the peppermint for my indigestion and the tobacco to make your grandmother mad.
Sharon!
Sharon!
Welcome home, darling.
- Mother!
- It's so good to have you home.
Let me look at you...
What on earth have you done to your hair?
- Cut it.
- That's certainly obvious.
I thought something was different.
What's done is done. It'll grow again.
What's the matter, Sharon?
Are those tears I see?
- I can't help it, Mother. If only you knew.
- Knew what?
- Sharon! When did you get back?
- She just arrived. She looks wonderful.
What have you done to your hair?
- She cut it.
- I had to because...
If my opinion means anything - which I doubt - I like it the way it is.
- Charles, stop burbling.
- I haven't burbled in years.
Go and read your newspaper.
- See you at dinner.
- Bye.
It doesn't look so bad.
It's hoydenish. Are you a boy or a girl?
Make up your mind. What's that?
It's a present I brought for you.
We made it... I made it for you.
- Thank you. What is it?
- A birdcage made of popsicle sticks.
- Come on upstairs with me.
- See you later.
- Did you make any friends?
- One girl in particular.
- Who is she?
- Just a girl.
- From Boston?
- No. Just from someplace.
Goodness, you're beautiful.
What is it? You're staring at me as if you've never seen me before.
I don't know. I'm just happy that you're here and you're you.
I'm happy that you're here and you're you.
Fasten me up.
- Did you miss me?
- Uh-huh. Did you miss me?
You'll never know.
Margaret, don't forget the Red Cross meeting. I'll see you at the Somerset.
Stand up, child. Don't slouch. I hope you haven't picked up bad habits.
- See you at the Somerset.
- Yes, Mother.
Why the frown?
You've got meetings and things.
I thought we could spend the day talking.
We have the whole weekend to talk.
I cannot cancel the Red Cross.
- What I have to say can wait.
- Yes, dear?
I just wanted to have a woman-to-woman talk with you about Stafford.
Who's Stafford?
This boy I met at camp.
I just wanted your advice on something.
On what?
Well... I wanted you to tell me how long you waited before you got married.
Sharon?
- Lockness?
- Yes, Miss Margaret.
Please tell my mother I can't meet her and cancel my appointments.
- Cancel them?
- Yes. Something important has come up.
Sharon, what I'm trying to say is that the decision to marry is best left till you've lived longer.
Mother, you're right.
Stafford was much too juvenile for me.
Thank goodness for that.
To be perfectly frank, the old zing wasn't there.
- Zing?
- Yes.
The charge that shoots up your spine.
Like when you met Daddy.
What was Daddy like?
Well, I don't know how we got around to him.
Is it terribly painful for you to talk about Daddy?
No. Why should it be?
I don't know. I thought maybe when you've been in love with somebody... the recollection and the memory might be bitterly painful.
Sharon, that was many years ago.
Don't dramatise it.
Where did he take you on your first date?
He took me to dinner - an Italian restaurant in one of those basements in New York.
- It was called "Martinelli's".
- "Martinelli's"?
- Yes.
- Hmm.
You said there was music.
What song did they play?
- Song?
- There must have been a song.
The old "they're playing our song" thing.
If there was, I wouldn't remember it.
It was too long ago.
Though time may tatter
Our first sweet thrill
It doesn't matter
It never will...
Susie!
- Hi, Peanut.
- Hi, Dad.
- How was camp?
- Fine.
No broken bones? No?
Come on, let's get the bags.
Here's my baggage check.
- Are you still biting your nails?
- You noticed. She told me you...
- What?
- Nothing.
I certainly did enjoy all those nice long newsy letters.
We meant to write, but we just got so tied up with plans and things...
- Who's we?
- Er... us. I mean... l...
Oh, us. There was a very nice girl there.
We became quite good friends.
That's mine. That's mine. There.
- Glad to be home?
- It's wonderful.
- Were you lonely while I was gone?
- I cried myself to sleep...
No. Seriously.
I got to play golf every day, poker at night.
I'd like to find a winter camp too.
- Ho ho!
- Ho ho! Good to have you home, goofy.
There's been a lot of things happening since you left.
We ought to have a talk sometime.
- I have some things to tell you too.
- You have?
- But not now.
- OK.
Now I just want to think about getting home and being with my father.
- My very own fah-ther.
- Own fah-ther?
Father.
Dad, it's beautiful!
It hasn't changed. Hecky!
- Yo!
- Look!
What have you got there with you, Mitch?
- Hi, Hecky.
- Hiya, darlin'.
Why did you bring her back?
I thought we'd got rid of her.
She was hanging around the airport.
- How was camp?
- Swell.
It's about time. We've been waiting all day!
Hi, Verbena.
Never mind hi. Give me a hug.
Hello, honey. Let me look at you.
- There's a change in you.
- Just the same as I always was.
No... You're not.
I'm not quite sure what it is.
Hi, Andromeda.
Stop that, Andromeda, you crazy dog.
It's Susan, you silly.
It's almost as if your own dog didn't know you.
Funny, isn't it? Dogs are funny things.
I guess I'll go up to my room and...
- Come on and tell me about camp.
- Coming.
Tell me all about camp.
I want to get your laundry too.
- Come down when you get through.
- Be down in a minute.
Hello, darling. I'm glad you're back.
I was beginning to get bored.
Did you tell her anything about us?
- Good to be home again.
- Sure is.
Verbena... there's a woman downstairs.
There is indeed.
Who is she? What is she doing here?
I'm not saying a word.
I mind my own business.
If he wants to make a ninny of himself, that's his affair.
- How did she get here?
- I don't say a word.
Except a man like your father with a daughter going on 14...
He's not exactly a charm fellow with a big teethy grin and lots of clever talk,
- so what does she see in him?
- I don't know.
I'll give you a million reasons and they're in the bank.
It was always thus.
What was always thus?
I'm not saying a word. I'm not one to talk about anybody behind their back.
But she's good. She's awful good.
Those cool blue eyes looking right through you.
Riding, swimming, out to dinner, but it's none of my business, so I'm not saying a word, not one single word.
Besides, you shouldn't talk about people...
Susie. We were just talking about you.
This is Miss Robinson.
- How do you do.
- I've been looking forward to meeting you.
Your father made you sound like a girl, but you're practically a woman.
- I'm nearly 14.
- I think I'll make a couple of Martinis.
- I'd love one.
- Honey, do you want a ginger ale?
- Ginger ale.
- Sure. You get acquainted now.
- I hear you were away at camp. Was it fun?
- Yes, it was lovely, thank you.
Ever since I met your father, it's been Susan this and Susan that.
It's wonderful that you're such good friends. Can you keep a secret?
- From whom?
- Your father.
Then you'd better not tell me.
Daddy and I don't keep secrets from one another. We tell each other everything.
No, dear. It wasn't that kind of a secret.
I just wanted to tell you that I find him a very wonderful person.
Well, between us, he's not too brilliant or clever with what he says.
You know, like the charm fellows we all adore.
We were riding the other day and he let me ride Schotzli.
I understand she's your horse.
I hope you don't mind my riding her.
No. Schotzli and I are used to strange women riding her.
What?
You know Daddy.
He's always playing the field.
- No, I didn't know.
- Oh, yes.
Every week he has some dame up here.
One week - I'll never forget - he had five different women up here.
You don't say.
It's none of my business if he wants to make a ninny of himself.
That's why I'm not saying a word.
Not one single word.
Here you are.
Did you two get to know each other?
Yes. We had a lovely little talk.
Hello?
- Susan Evers?
- Yes.
- Go ahead.
- It's Sharon. How's everything?
Mother's the absolute living end!
She's gorgeous, breathtaking.
I got her talking about her first date.
Italian dinner...
Susan, listen!
And their song goes like this.
For now, for always...
I've got something to tell you...
- Susan!
- What?
You have to bring Mother out here now.
No! I just had one day with her.
I hardly got to know her.
It's an emergency.
There's a woman here and she's beautiful.
Is that all? Dad'll never get serious.
He's serious about this one.
He's trying to get us to be friends.
Well, bust it up.
Follow them and submarine her.
- You've got to get Mother out here.
- I want more time.
You've had her for 13 years! I won't. Do the best you can and stay on Daddy's tail.
- Susan, please!
- I won't give up Mother this soon. Goodbye.
Susan?
I'm glad you came today. There's something
I want to talk to you about.
- What is it?
- You know the girl you met - Vicky?
I thought we ought to be alone a little so we could talk.
- I wanted to talk about something too.
- OK. Go ahead.
Those weeks at camp,
I've been wondering about my mother.
Why do you want to wonder about something like that?
It's perfectly natural for a girl.
Where is she?
I don't know. Maybe she went to Spain and married some drunk.
Daddy, that's not true.
All right. You wouldn't like her anyway.
Big staring eyes, red frizzy hair and she was fat, really fat.
Then why did you fall in love with her?
You lose your head sometimes.
Besides, I... Wait a minute.
Fletcher, play on through.
I'll pick you up at the bar.
Sit down.
Honey, you don't want to start thinking about your mother.
There's no need for that.
You can always talk to me about anything.
It's not the same.
Father and daughter is OK, but when a girl gets to a certain age, that's when she misses a mother.
Why? I mean...
- You mean to talk about certain things?
- Yeah.
That?
I guess we never have talked about that.
This is a kind of odd place, but it's as good as any.
We might as well get it over with.
- How much do you know already?
- About what?
- About what you were talking about.
- Absolutely nothing.
- Nothing?
- Well, you never brought up the subject.
Well, honey... All right. Let's get straight on one thing first. Little boys.
I know how they are because I used to be a little boy once, so I know.
- I don't know...
- I used to be a little boy and I know.
- I know about it.
- Daddy, you're too funny for words.
- What do you mean?
- I've known about all that for years.
- What were we just talking about then?
- What were you talking about?
Well, er...
I'd better putt out.
There's the little beast now.
She's nothing but a child.
She's a conniving, vicious, two-faced brat.
Just smile, pet.
Think of California and that wonderful community property law, and just smile.
- Hi.
- Hello, Mitchell, darling.
- Hi, Edna.
- Who is this ecstatic bright-eyed child?
- It couldn't be...
- Sure. It's Susie.
- This is Vicky's mother.
- How do you do.
- This girl is the one you call Peanut Face?
- Daddy, really!
Come over here to your Auntie Edna and we can get to know one another.
I want to hear all about you. Down you go.
- Hi.
- Did you tell her?
I started to, then I don't know what happened.
- Oh, Mitch...
- All right. Let me do it my own way.
It's all settled. Susan and I have decided we'll all have a jolly lunch here.
Edna, I'm sorry, we can't today.
I promised to spend the whole day with Susie.
- I'm terribly sorry.
- That's all right. Another time, dear.
- You're an adorable thing!
- We're going to take a ride.
- Have fun.
- Bye, darling.
First change I make, off she goes to a boarding school in Switzerland.
Honey, I've been meaning to ask you... what do you think of Vicky?
In what respect?
Well... It's just an ordinary question.
No, it's not.
You asked me what I think of Vicky.
What do I think of Vicky as what?
If you asked me what do I think of her as a fashion model or a famous aviatrix, then maybe I can express an opinion, but just to ask...
All right. What do you think of Vicky as a person?
Daddy, I really couldn't say.
She's a perfect stranger to me.
- Race you to the house!
- Wait a minute. Susie!
I'm not through talking to you!
Hi, darling.
- Hi.
- Hello, sweetie.
He can't. He just can't.
It makes me so mad.
A man of his age.
All our work and our plans!
Hi.
You used to confide in me.
Anything you want to talk over with me?
No.
Like telling me why Andromeda never comes near you?
Or why your appetite's changed?
Verbena, you are a mystic.
Mystic? I'm no mystic.
Asking me all these crazy questions.
I don't know what you're getting at.
You know what I'm talking about.
There's something very strange about you.
Are you sure there isn't anything you want to tell me?
What do you want me to tell you?
I don't know. It's almost as if you were...
- That's impossible.
- Almost as if I were who?
Forget it, honey. Never mind.
You mean Sharon?
Where did you hear about her?
Oh, Verbena.
I've got to tell someone, but you've got to swear never to tell Daddy. Promise?
- Try to be diplomatic.
- I know how to talk to my daughter.
She's not exactly insensitive.
Susan!
Hi, Dad. Just getting back?
- Just a minute. I want to talk to you.
- Didn't know what a good thing you had.
Susie!
Why did you run off? I want to talk to you.
I'm listening.
- Get comfortable.
- I am comfortable. What do you want?
First of all, about me.
You probably think of me as just your father and to you I seem ancient and old...
- Not ancient, Daddy.
- Certainly not. I'm in my best years.
- OK. Don't get nervous.
- I'm not nervous.
What seems old to you isn't really old when you get old...
I mean, when you get to be my age it won't seem old to you at all and you'll...
Where did you learn how to play the piano?
- Oh... They taught us at camp.
- That's awfully good in five weeks...
Could you stop now?
- Sure.
- Pay attention.
I've been wanting to have this little talk about...
What would you think about our making Vicky part of our family?
- Part of our family?
- Uh-huh.
- I think that's a wonderful idea.
- You do?
I certainly do.
I've always wanted to have a sister.
- No, honey. You're missing the point.
- How sweet of you to want to adopt her.
No, baby. I don't want to adopt her.
I want to marry her.
Marry her? Oh, Dad!
You've just got to be kidding!
You can't marry her. She's just a child.
- She's a woman! Stop calling her a child.
- It's all relative. Don't you see?
- Compared to her, you're an old man.
- I am not!
You are too! It's the most revolting thing
I've ever heard!
I won't discuss it unless you stop shouting.
- But Dad!
- Stop it.
All right. I'm not screaming.
I will talk about this perfectly calmly and rationally.
You can't get married!
You'll ruin everything! All our plans!
- What are you talking about?
- And my hair! Look at my hair.
I cut it for you. And my fingernails
I've bitten for you!
Of all the big-headed fathers!
All those days and weeks, nothing but working!
And names and... Oh!
I tried to talk to her and she gets hysterical. She's not making sense.
Let me speak to her for a minute, darling.
Make yourself scarce.
- Hello, darling.
- He's making a ninny of himself.
It came as quite a shock to you.
Men put things so badly.
Can't you and I discuss this calmly together like grown-up women?
I'm sure we can.
You're not afraid to talk to me, are you?
I'm not afraid to talk to anybody.
You're old enough to understand that wonderful mystery that can happen between a man and woman.
I know what wonderful mystery
Daddy sees in you... and I can't say I blame him either.
You're very nicely put together.
Your father underestimates you, I think.
I'm sure you won't, Vicky.
Susan, dear...
You've had him to yourself all this time and I can understand that having another woman around is an intrusion.
But all my life, I've hoped and waited for someone like him - someone gentle and mature, rough-edged, but quick to laugh, understanding and wise.
All things I love and cherish in him.
- Well, that's very refreshing.
- Why, dear?
Most girls run after Daddy because he's so wealthy.
- You think I'd marry him for his money?!
- If the shoe fits, wear it.
I've tried to be friendly, but I'm going to marry your father, so get used to the idea.
You wanna bet?
Honey, don't you play with the big girls.
You'll be in way over your head.
Operator.
Get me Western Union, please.
For Sharon? A child of her age getting a telegram?
Let her read it. It belongs to her.
Who would be sending her a telegram?
Sharon?
"Alexander Graham. Three a.m."
- California.
- Who could she know in California?
Bertha Waterbury. This girl I met at camp.
Sensational girl.
It's a rather cryptic message.
What does it mean?
She's crazy about this boy, Alexander.
And he took her on a date until three a.m.
- A child of that age!
- Now, Mother...
Hello?
- Susan Evers?
- Yes.
- Go ahead.
- It's me again.
I know. I had a hard time explaining your telegram.
Grandmother went into a lecture on raising children!
You've got to believe me.
I'm in horrible trouble.
- Don't dramatise it.
- I'm not. It's serious.
- The worse thing.
- It's gone that far?
Mother ought to be here.
OK. Tomorrow morning I'll break the bomb.
How's Mother?
Kiss her for me, and Grandpa.
OK. Bye.
Oh! Hi, Grandpa.
Hi... Susan.
- Susan?
- Yes. Sit down.
I think you and I ought to have a little chat.
We've got the Picasso exhibition at four o'clock, Margaret.
- Are you coming, Charles?
- No, thank you.
Then Mrs Saunders' tea.
Caroline's daughter's coming.
- Really?
- Sharon, you've got dancing at 10.30.
Then straight on to the musical appreciation course.
- Staimes can take her in your car, Charles?
- Yes.
- At three o'clock...
- I won't be able to do those today.
- What did you say?
- Sharon, you interrupted your grandmother.
I have something important to tell you.
Mother... I think what you and Daddy did to us children is lousy! I think it stinks!
Sharon!
I'm not Sharon, I'm Susan.
Sharon is out in California with Daddy.
- Impossible.
- You can't be Susan.
But I am Susan! Sharon and I met at camp, so we decided to switch places.
She bit her nails and I cut her hair.
And she's out in California with Dad, swimming and riding my horse, and I'm stuck with music lessons that I hate!
Susan...
I'm sorry, Mother.
But I wanted to see you, and I miss not having a mother.
I love you very much, and I wondered if you could love me as me and not as Sharon... please?
Oh, Susan.
Oh, my darling. Why didn't you let me know?
Why didn't you tell me?
I couldn't help it. I wanted to know what it was like to have a mother and everything.
My baby.
- Susan, darling!
- Oh, Grandmother.
- She's exactly like Sharon.
- I know.
- Louise?
- What is it?
Louise.
- What is it?
- Most important.
What is it?
- They ought to be alone for a minute.
- Is that all?
Margaret hasn't seen her since she was one.
I'm her grandmother!
Louise, for once I'm putting my foot down.
Let them alone.
I've tried, Mother, honestly, but I don't understand.
It doesn't mean your father and I didn't love each other, but sometimes people just don't get on together.
So you have to switch us back again?
Legally, you belong to your father and Sharon belongs to me.
His and hers.
Makes me feel like a bathroom towel.
It's lousy, isn't it?
Don't worry. We'll find a way.
Six months split.
That's how it's going to end up.
A lot of kids in camp had that problem.
Six months with one parent, six months with the other - like a yo-yo.
I don't like it any more than you do, but I'm not going to lose you now.
- Bettina, would you put this in your case?
- Yes, Ma'am.
- May I come in?
- Of course.
- I have you on the noon plane.
- That's not much time.
- Best I can do on short notice.
- Thank you.
Traffic's pretty heavy these days.
Are you wearing that dress on the trip?
- What's wrong with it?
- It's very nice.
Give my best to Mitch when you see him.
- I wonder what kind of a wife he has.
- Who said he's married?
A vital, romantic fellow like Mitch, it's a cinch he's found a nice young wife.
I hope she likes the great outdoors and can scale fish.
- No sour grapes now.
- Bettina, could you find my blue skirt?
Yes, Ma'am.
Margaret, I've got to hand it to you, it shows strength of character not to go with the new fashion trends in clothes.
What are you getting at?
I was just saying that...
Take your hairstyle...
- What's wrong with it?
- That's what I mean.
Women are wearing their hair a little fuller...
- Are you looking for a fight?
- With my favourite daughter? No.
Don't get me wrong.
My goodness, you are what you are.
- I wouldn't change you for the world.
- Who's going to change?
- Stay the way you are.
- I certainly intend to.
A nice, reliable, settled, comfortable woman, who accepts the coming of age with grace and dignity.
That's the most horrible thing anybody could say!
You're flying off the handle and I only came in to kiss you and wish you good luck.
Goodbye, daughter.
Goodbye.
Give my regards to Mitch.
Come to think of it, that dress seems perfect for you.
I'm all packed. What time do we go?
On the noon plane. Have you got everything in we wanted for Sharon?
- How would you like to stop in New York?
- Yeah! Why?
We could do some shopping before we head west.
We got a nice calf there.
What's eating you?
You ever have the feeling that something's gonna happen? Like a storm brewing?
No. Come on.
Verbena!
Verbena, we're here! Sharon!
Verbena! We're here!
Come on, Mother.
- Darling!
- Verbena.
Mrs Evers! You look wonderful.
Let me take your things.
- I'll take them inside. Oh, darling!
- Verbena. How are you?
I'm fine. We've missed you.
- Thank you. Keep the change.
- Thank you.
I can't wait to show you how lovely everything is.
- It was wonderful.
- Fine.
Mother! I'm so glad you came!
You look wonderful! What did you do?
- You like it?
- I love it.
Oh, darling!
Finally, both of you together at last.
- What do you think of each other?
- Fine.
We love each other.
- Hi, Sue.
- Hi.
- And just look at you. That short hair.
- I cut it, Mother.
- I like it!
- And I love yours, Mother.
- Where's your father?
- Out on a horse.
Are we in time?
- Time?
- Didn't you tell her?
Tell me what?
- Well...
- Dad's getting married.
Well...
- When is all this taking place?
- Saturday, supposedly.
She just infiltrated, Mother, and before you knew it, Dad was hooked.
Mr Evers is slipping into his second childhood.
He's old enough to know what he's doing.
Shall we get unpacked?
I'm dying to get into a hot shower.
- Want a beer?
- Yeah. Be in in a minute.
You know I don't say a word, but the things that Vicky woman has been up to...
Really?
- Hi, Dad.
- Oh, hi.
- Look who's talking to me.
- Why shouldn't I talk to you?
Come on!
I can get married any time I want to!
You've been walking around the house like a mummy for two days.
You, me, two days - nothing!
- Remember?
- Oh, you were...
I guess I have been acting sulky.
Sulky?
That's the understatement of the year.
Sulky? You've been plain impossible.
You've been monstrous!
Pouting is childish.
You're too old for that.
Not speaking to someone because you're mad at them is...
- Feminine.
- Yes. The worst part of being feminine.
- The doorbell's ringing.
- Yes.
That's the minister and Miss Robinson and you're to be polite to them.
Come here.
Hello.
Mitchell, I want you to meet Dr Mosby.
Dr Mosby, Mitchell Evers, the groom.
How beautiful! Isn't this lovely?
So masculine.
Mitch, it needs a woman's touch.
There's that angelic creature again.
- How are you today, Susan?
- Fine, thank you.
This is Reverend Mosby.
He's doing the marriage.
- How do you do.
- How do you do.
I've gotta change. Will you excuse me?
How would you like to be hostess?
Be polite.
- Hi, Dad.
- Hi, honey.
- There are some people downstairs.
- I know.
Your grandfather sends his love.
Your grandmother does too.
- She's downstairs.
- Who, Vicky?
- I've seen her.
- Well, I haven't.
- Susie...
- Did you want something?
No, honey. Never mind.
Mother, this is my wedding. You've had four.
- Why didn't you mix some drinks?
- We waited for you.
- Edna?
- Anything you have.
- The usual, darling.
- Reverend, I don't suppose you indulge?
Perhaps a little something by way of a nuptial toast.
- Good.
- Bourbon, double, on the rocks.
Yes, sir.
Vicky, think how an outdoor ceremony will look in the newspapers.
I'm inclined to agree, Mrs Robinson.
The Marco-Dennisons had their wedding under a striped tent.
Last month it was.
The atmosphere was ideally apropos - there in God's natural setting under the trees. Thank you.
Thank you.
- Mitch!
- Upsadaisy, darling.
I think your idea about having the wedding outside is wonderful.
Vicky can come down the walk...
It's all right, I've got him.
Give me your hand.
Mitch, darling!
- Are you all right?
- Yes, I'm all right!
I'll be back in just a minute.
- Mitch.
- Maggie.
- How are you?
- Fine, thanks. How are you?
I'm fine. Gee, you look...
- I've got people out there!
- Don't start yelling. Let me explain.
- If you just keep quiet, I'll tell you!
- What are you doing here?
If you stop screaming, she'll explain!
Surprise.
That's what I was trying to tell you.
Both of them?
The two of them together.
Maggie, how did it happen?
We met at camp and the whole thing came out.
- They switched places on us.
- They what?
Sue came to Boston to be with me.
You mean this is Sharon?
I had Sharon all this time?
You're Sharon?
I wanted to know what you were like and Susan wanted to meet Mother.
You are Sharon.
- You were only a tiny baby when I...
- You're not mad, are you?
No, sweetheart.
I just can't believe it's you.
- The trouble I had burping you.
- Daddy, really!
No. I mean it. I spent nights walking up and down with you. Two o'clock feeds...
- And where was I?
- Well, it was half and half.
You used up more diapers than ten kids.
- Daddy, diapers!
- Yes, diapers.
- Look at you now. Look at her.
- I'm quite grown up.
- And quite without a father.
- Oh, honey...
- And I'm quite without a mother.
- Shh!
Girls, we'll discuss this later on.
I want to talk to your father now.
Come on, Sharon. They want to be alone.
Daddy...
Daddy, please don't marry that woman.
All right, Sharon. Run along now.
Will you look at that? I can't believe it.
The last time I saw them together, they were that big and you were pushing them.
What a time for you to show up!
I'm going to get married!
I didn't know.
Sharon told me when I got here.
- That girl is my fiancée.
- I know. I saw her.
All right. Let's have it.
- I think she's adorable!
- Sure you do.
- Except for what?
- I think she's a perfect dream.
Of course, her eyes are a little close together.
Maggie, those tricks don't work any more.
Can you go and put on something decent?
I'm perfectly decent.
Running around in my bathrobe!
She'll come in and it looks like we just...
- Like we what?
- Just go and put on some clothes!
Don't use that tone.
We're not married anymore!
This is my house and you're not running around...
Don't start ordering me around!
Maggie, go on upstairs and put on some clothes or...
Don't use force on me.
I lammed you once and I can do it...
- Stand back.
- Maggie, don't start that.
- Come on.
- Get your hands off me. I'm warning you.
- Did you have to do that?
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean it.
Why do you have to get so physical?
I can't talk to you.
You're always trying to belt me.
- That's vicious.
- It can't be that bad.
- It is that bad!
- Let me see it.
- Leave it alone. You've done enough.
- Let me see.
Don't... Ow!
Mitch, stop acting like a big baby.
I didn't get a look at it.
- I want a doctor.
- Don't be ridiculous.
Mr Evers? The ladies were wondering...
Oh, excuse me.
Reverend?
Wait a minute, sir.
There's nothing wrong here.
There's nothing wrong at all.
It's pretty easy to explain. You see...
- This is my wife.
- Hello.
- How do you do.
- How do you do.
But what about?
Oh, no. Ex-wife.
She came out here - very unexpectedly - to discuss some mix-up about the children, and I merely suggested she put on something decent because you...
Why am I telling you?
It's none of your business.
He didn't ask for an explanation.
You're babbling on as if there were... something to hide.
Dr Mosby isn't at all shocked at seeing me like this.
Of course he's shocked.
Running around in that get-up...
I'm not shocked. I see nothing wrong with your wife's attire.
- Ex-wife.
- She's very beautiful.
You see, I knew I liked you.
You'll find I'm not without a sense of humour.
I find this situation fraught with humour.
Quite out of the everyday, as we say.
Could you excuse us for just a moment?
Maggie, will you try to be a little understanding, please?
I've got to explain why you're here.
That's not going to be easy.
I suppose they'll want to meet me.
That's only natural.
I want to keep this above board.
Very well. I'll just slip into something more comfortable.
Very funny.
- Dr Mosby, don't run away.
- I'll be here.
- I'll be back in a minute.
- I'll look forward to it.
A delightful woman, Mr Evers.
How ever did you let her slip away?
She's simply delightful.
- Why couldn't she go to a hotel?
- I didn't invite her.
- I knew it would go wrong.
- Nothing's wrong.
- Nothing's wrong?
- She's unpacked.
- She's staying the night?
- I won't have it!
You're reading implications into...
- Would you like to enjoy the garden?
- No. I'm enjoying this immensely.
- You are?
- Interesting situation.
Quite out of the everyday.
Yes. It sure is.
Edna, I guarantee by tomorrow morning, she'll be...
Mitch, I will not have her spending the night.
Vicky, she's not that kind of a woman.
She's a woman, that's enough.
Edna, she's not what you think at all.
First, she's from Boston.
She's older, more mature. She's had two children. She's the motherly type.
Vicky, I swear you've got nothing to...
Sorry to keep you waiting.
I'm Margaret McKendrick.
- Hello, hello, hello.
- Hello, again.
And this must be Vicky.
I'd know you anywhere from Mitch's description.
- I'm Mrs Robinson.
- Whoops!
- Sorry, Mitch.
- It could happen to anybody.
Vicky?
Oh, you are divine.
She's simply breathtaking.
- I was just thinking the same about you.
- At my age?
You are a sweet child.
- Mitch described you somewhat differently.
- He certainly did.
Excuse me.
You know what husbands think about ex-wives - an old comfortable worn-out shoe cast in the closet.
Well, off with the old and on with the new, eh? I must say, you are young.
- Isn't that lucky for Mitch?
- Yes.
I was thrilled to hear you were going to take the plunge with old Mitch.
We must celebrate the occasion.
Mitch, open some champagne.
Tell me all about yourself.
We must get to be very good friends.
No! I don't want you to be friends.
That's not the idea.
- We have to be running anyway.
- Perhaps you'd better...
All good things have to end.
What a pity. Just as we were getting to know each other.
So nice to have met you.
I know you won't be at the wedding, but it'll be in the society columns.
- I never read them.
- What a shame.
I never go to funerals or weddings.
I prefer elopements. They're more romantic.
What a shame you can't stay for dinner with us.
Yes. Vicky and I have a million things to do - fittings and odds and ends to buy.
Just charge it all to Mitch. He's loaded.
- Oh? I didn't know.
- Didn't you?
Goodbye, it was so nice to have met you.
Goodbye, Vicky.
You're just as cute as you can be.
Bye.
Delightful, charming woman. Amazing how he let her slip away from him.
You want me to lose my job?
Your pa will fire me.
- Please, Hecky.
- We're leaving tomorrow. Please?
No. I won't be part of a conspiracy like this.
He'll do it, or he'll cook his own meals for the next month.
A gypsy?
What happened to dinner?
- Dinner's being served on the patio.
- Whose idea's that?
- It's none of my never mind. I never...
- I know. You never say a word.
I mind my own business.
I've been doing that for years.
Verbena! What's all this?
Go and sit down, Daddy. Don't ruin it.
- Ruin what?
- Go and sit down. Dinner's ready.
Well! What's all this?
Don't ask me. I just got here. It's just my house. Nobody ever tells me anything.
And dinner on the patio.
Was this your idea, Mitch?
No, it was not. What are you looking at?
Mitch, that eye looks dreadful.
You must put something on it.
- Don't concern yourself.
- Did you step on a rake?
No. A very well-bred, ladylike,
Bostonian matron pinned it on me.
Anybody I know? Oh, Verbena!
- It's special for tonight.
- It smells delicious.
- What do you call that?
- Veal Parmigian.
Veal? I hate that kind of stuff.
She knows that.
- What do you think you're doing?
- I may go out and kill myself.
Hecky, it's time!
Excuse me, Mitch. All right!
- Mitch, please don't laugh.
- What's the matter?
- Don't you see?
- Ladies and gentlemen... the management have some entertainment for you.
Without further ado, ladies and gentlemen,
I'd like to introduce, direct from Boston, playing Beethoven's Fifth Symphony on the piano, Miss Sharon McKendrick.
What's all this noise?
Will you get off the stage?
I'm in the middle of a concert.
A concert? You're going to put the paying customers to sleep.
You gotta get the new sound.
Let's compromise. You give a little,
I'll give a little. Let's get together.
That's it!
Let's get together, yeah, yeah, yeah
Why don't you and I combine?
Let's get together, what do you say?
We can have a swinging time
We'd be a crazy team
Why don't we make the scene?
Together
Oh oh oh oh
Let's get together, yeah, yeah, yeah
Think of all that we could share
Let's get together every day
Every way and everywhere
And though we haven't got a lot
We could be sharing all we've got
Together
Oh! I really think you're swell
Uh-huh! You really ring the bell
Oo-ee! And if you stick with me
Nothing could be greater
Say hey, alligator!
Let's get together, yeah, yeah, yeah
Two is twice as nice as one
Let's get together right away
We'll be having twice the fun
And you can always count on me
A gruesome twosome we will be
Let's get together, yeah, yeah, yeah!
That was wonderful, girls!
- Great!
- Marvellous!
- Come and have dinner.
- We got spaghetti and glop.
It's all right.
We've already had dinner in the kitchen.
Yes. You enjoy yourselves. We're going to bed. Goodnight, Mom. 'Night, Dad.
Goodnight, Mom. Have fun.
- Goodnight, girls.
- Goodnight, kids.
How about those two little monkeys putting that together?
- They've done more than that.
- What do you mean?
Don't you understand? The drippy candles, the violin music, the Veal Parmigiana.
Martinelli's. Don't you remember?
- Oh...
- Our first date. They recreated it.
Crazy, sweet kids.
What?
Nothing.
What are we going to do about them?
We certainly can't keep them apart.
No, we sure can't do that.
I guess the only logical thing we can do is try to share them.
You could take them for six months, then I'd have them.
That way they'd be together.
- I think that's best. Don't you?
- Yes, I guess it is.
"Six months split".
That's what Susan calls it.
That's all we can do.
You know, Mitch, all of a sudden, I'm very depressed.
It would have been worse if we'd stayed together - all that fighting.
- Your Irish temper.
- You were just as difficult.
Sure. I admit it.
It was a mistake in the beginning.
- Was it?
- It's pretty obvious, isn't it?
You haven't changed much.
The years have been good to you, Mitch.
Well? Aren't you going to return the compliment?
Yeah. As a matter of fact,
Maggie, you look pretty good.
Don't stumble over the words.
You don't have to say them!
I mean it.
What did you do to yourself anyway?
Do to myself?!
16 plastic surgeons and a reconstruction job on my face so I could be presentable!
Do you think I'm some troll who crawled out of the woods to come calling on you?
I'm not as young as that simpering, baby-faced, platinum doll who's hooked you.
- Don't get started on Vicky.
- Don't say anything about precious Vicky!
That plotz-faced child bride and her electric hips!
- I'm sorry, Mitch.
- It always happens, doesn't it?
Yeah.
It won't happen any more.
I'm leaving in the morning with Sharon.
I really do mean this, Mitch. I wish you the best of everything with Vicky.
Holy smokes!
What a lousy mess they made of that.
All our plans.
Mother and I will be leaving tomorrow.
Don't give up.
We've got all night to think of something.
Like what?
I don't know.
But something.
- Sharon! Taxi's waiting.
- I'm coming!
- Susan, aren't you coming to say goodbye?
- Be right there, Mother!
Sharon! Susan!
I'll send Susan back for Christmas.
I'll see that Sharon comes here for Easter.
I suppose that's the best way.
I suppose so.
What are you doing in those clothes?
Sharon, what is this?
We've thought it over and we've come to a decision.
- We decided we were getting gypped.
- Yeah.
What do you mean?
We decided that we wanted to spend our camp-out together.
- So whichever of us is Sharon...
- And we won't tell.
Whichever of us is Sharon isn't going to Boston.
Don't get smart with me, girls.
Sharon, go upstairs and put your suit on.
- Are you sure she's Sharon?
- Of course she is.
Aren't you?
- Tough to tell, ain't it?
- Ain't it?
Isn't it! Stop this.
We're going to miss the plane.
That's the idea.
- Mitch, do something!
- Susan...
- Yes, Daddy?
- Yes, Daddy?
- That's not funny.
- That's not funny.
- That's not funny.
- This one is Susan - the smart alec.
- Are you sure?
- I know my own daughter, don't I?
You're not really sure, are you, Daddy?
- I'm not.
- I think they're ready to listen.
Here's the deal. We leave for the camp-out immediately - all of us.
When you bring us back on Friday, we'll tell you who's Sharon and who's Susan.
That's the deal. Take it or leave it.
What am I supposed to do for three days?
Stay home and knit?
It's not my fault. I can't tell them apart.
- Give them a spanking and make them tell!
- You don't spank 13-year-olds.
- Is she coming?
- That's part of the deal.
- I won't have it.
- Good morning, Vicky.
- I will not have you in the woods with her.
- You're right.
- Maggie, keep out of this.
- You can't leave her for three whole days.
- What would people say?
- Right. What do you suggest?
- I think you ought to come with us.
- Maybe I will.
It's the thing to do.
We'll have to get you another outfit.
I know where Mitch keeps his shirts and we can find you some boots...
- Are they all coming with us?
- Yup.
- Hecky, here's some more stuff.
- Hi, Dad.
Here.
Why don't we get going?
Just fasten the belt a bit tighter.
- Where does she think she's going?
- She's coming along.
- Are you kidding?
- Nope.
- Here we are, Mitch. All ready.
- But she can't come along!
Girls, don't be rude.
Your father couldn't possibly leave Vicky alone for three whole days.
- Let's get this show on the road.
- Vicky, you sit beside Mitch.
- If you don't mind.
- My pleasure.
- You and Vicky ought to be up there alone.
- What are you saying?
- Maggie, in or out?
- If you're not going, I...
Don't worry your pretty little head about me. I'll just lie around the lake.
You can get to know the girls.
You're going to have them for six months a year. Bye. Watch out for snakes.
- Thanks a lot!
- Bye, girls. Have a good time.
- You all right?
- I'm just dandy. Some fun.
- What's the matter?
- Vicky's not used to this. Let's rest.
The lake's only another hour.
Look. I'll put it on, yes?
- Gee, isn't it hot?
- What of it?
I thought you'd like some of my water.
Thanks a lot.
Oh! There's a thing on it!
- What is it?
- It's only a little old tree lizard.
It wouldn't hurt anybody. Look.
- Get that thing away from me!
- Cut that out!
Get that away from me.
I hate them. They're just miserable.
- You two stay here and help Vicky, OK?
- Sure. We'll help her.
Sure you'll help me - right over a cliff.
What did we do?
Never mind those angelic faces.
I know vixens when I see 'em.
Just remember this.
You start anything and I'll make your lives miserable later on.
You get me, pets?
See that? Cougar tracks.
- It's a form of mountain lion.
- No kidding? Lions?
Sure. There are hundreds up here.
They really mess you up.
They'll grab at your eyes, eat you.
There's a trick an old Indian guide showed me.
You hit two sticks together and the noise frightens them.
- Like that?
- Yeah. That'll keep them away.
Come on.
Quick.
- Enjoying yourself?
- Perfectly wonderful.
My feet are killing me.
Soak them in the lake.
That'll cool them off.
You think? I'll try anything.
- Come in. It's not deep.
- Are you sure?
Look, I'm standing.
Mitch!
Hecky, you did yourself proud.
Thanks. You sure you won't change your mind, Miss?
I detest trout! How many times do
I have to tell you? I'll eat in the morning.
- What are we having for breakfast?
- Trout.
We always eat off the trail up here.
That's part of the fun of it.
Part of the fun? What else do you do?
Throw rocks in the lake?
You insisted on coming. Make the best of it.
I was tricked into coming. She tricked me.
She sure did.
Hecky can always take you down.
Sure. I'd be happy to walk you down to the truck.
I'll stick it out, thanks.
They think I'm running a blood bank!
I think they like this stuff.
- What have you got?
- Mosquito repellent.
It doesn't smell like anything.
- That's nothing but sugar and water.
- What?
That'll bring every mosquito around.
Where did you get it?
An old Indian scout gave it to me.
Said it would keep mosquitoes away.
Hecky, I think I'll have some more trout.
Yeah.
I'm turning in.
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight, Vicky.
- Goodnight, Vicky.
Vicky?
Honey, what are you doing?
- I'm keeping the mountain lions away.
- Mountain lions?
Yeah. The noise...
- The noise doesn't frighten mountain lions.
- No.
Goodnight!
- Why did you do that?
- I swear that...
Never mind.
It's a terrible thing to do. Isn't it?
Just terrible.
I don't want any more of that. Understand?
- Yes, Daddy.
- Both of you.
- Yes, Daddy.
- All right.
Get them out of here! Get them out!
Get them away from me!
Get those wild animals out!
Get them away from me!
I hate this filthy, stinking, dirty place!
What are you yelling about, Miss?
Those bear cubs wouldn't hurt a fly.
You shut up and get me my boots!
Yes, Ma'am.
I hate this place!
This is not my idea of fun!
I hate the sticks! I hate the lake!
I hate the filthy bugs!
- I can't stand this place!
- What the heck are you doing?
- What's happening?
- You overgrown jerk! It's not worth it!
Do you want your clothes, Vicky?
Thanks a heap. You're twins.
Do you share everything?
- Everything. Everything.
- Give your sister her half of this!
Wait a minute.
They didn't do anything to you.
You'll never know what they did to me, you big goon!
Get me out of this stinking fresh air!
- Mother, where are you?
- Hi!
- You're back early. Which one are you?
- Sharon.
- Did you have a good time?
- Sensational.
- We did, but I don't think Vicky did.
- What happened?
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi.
- How are you?
- Wonderful.
- Hello.
- Good evening.
- Have you had your dinner?
- We're not hungry.
Then go and have your baths.
You look filthy.
Then we'll tell you about Vicky, but not while he's there.
So you had a wonderful time.
What happened?
Don't give me that. You knew darn well what was going to happen.
What happened?
You name it and it happened.
It was a shambles. Happy?
It's the last time
I take a woman to the mountains.
Where's? What's her name?
- Vicky?
- Yeah.
She took off like a pelican.
She's probably at Park Avenue and
57th Street by now, and good luck to her.
- Well?
- We've been talking...
...and we feel that we owe you an apology.
We feel guilty about what we did to Vicky.
- What did you do to her?
- Well...
We submarined her.
It's none of our business who you want to marry, and we ruined it.
Well...
It's done with now so we won't talk about it anymore.
We're sorry, Dad. Will you forgive us?
Go on to bed, you monsters.
What can you do?
- Want something to eat?
- You sure you've got enough?
Sure. I cooked enough for you and Susan for dinner tomorrow.
Sharon and I are leaving in the morning.
- Yeah.
- Wash your hands.
Yeah. I'd better.
Where's Verbena?
I wasn't expecting you back. It didn't make sense for her to stay just for me, so I gave her the night off.
I'll just go upstairs and wash up.
I'll be back in a few minutes.
I don't know what he saw in her.
She had no personality at all.
Wow!
- Are you going to a party?
- None of your business.
Goodnight, ladies. Sleep tight.
Hi.
I thought you were just going to wash your hands.
I thought I'd do a good job of it.
- Shh!
- Why?
Do you hear music?
I told those children to take a bath!
That's the hi-fi. I thought a little music would be nice with dinner.
Also, I thought red wine might be good with the stew.
To the mother of my children - the most beautiful mother two kids ever had.
- You can be the most exasperating man.
- What's the matter?
Waiting until we're in the kitchen and me in bare feet.
- I like you in bare feet.
- It puts a woman at a disadvantage.
Good. Here's to your disadvantage.
Sit down and eat your stew.
Don't spill it now.
- Darn!
- What's the matter?
I put a dishcloth on and it's knotted.
Open it for me.
Maggie, as long as everybody's apologising,
I think I'd better do mine too.
About the other night.
I didn't mean for it to sound like that.
I'm not very good with compliments, what with growing up with the cows...
Don't give me that routine.
You handed me that years ago.
- I did not.
- You certainly did.
It worked, didn't it? You liked it.
Maggie, you're so beautiful.
No. I mean it.
I know I don't say things like you want to hear them, but I've been thinking about you.
And us, and the way things used to be.
- Do you know what I miss most of all?
- Mitch...
You've got stew all over you.
- I don't care.
- Go and wash it off.
What do you miss?
Well...
I don't care if it does sound silly.
I miss those wet stockings you used to have hanging around the bathroom.
And I miss my razor being dull because you used it for your legs.
I miss the hairpins mixed up with the fish hooks in my tackle box.
It's no fun having a clothes closet all to myself.
It's no fun swearing because you're not around to pretend to be shocked by it.
Nothing's any good without you, Maggie.
I miss a lot of things.
I just miss you.
Why did you take so long to tell me?
I don't know.
Well, because... I guess I was hoping that you'd come back sometime.
Maggie, I've been a prize chump.
We've both been.
We're going to grow into a couple of old lonely people if we don't do something.
- I know.
- You don't want that, do you?
No, Mitch.
Oh, Mitch. It's been so long. So very long.
Don't cry. You can slug me in the eye any time you want.
OK.
- What's the matter?
- I just had the craziest dream.
- Oh, my goodness.
- What is it?
You and I were marching along real slow, funny-like, in organdie dresses.
And there was music
and flowers and people.
For my love was meant for
Was heaven-sent for now
For always
For you!
This is Hollywood.
Land of the real and the unreal.
The unreal are the actors.
And the reel, nothing more
than a thing to put film on.
From up here, I guess
it doesn't look very much different
from your hometown.
But how would you know?
You don't go around looking
at your hometown from a plane.
This is a town where dedicated people
spend every waking hour
applying their varied talents
to the making of a product,
the only purpose of which is
to take you away
from the harsh realities of life into
the wondrous land of Make-Believe.
What's your pleasure?
Westerns?
Cheesecake?
Suspense?
Brutality?
How about a love story?
Yes, a love story.
I love you very much.
Saying it is very trivial.
I love you too.
Oh, my beautiful, wonderful man.
I could listen to you for hours.
But that would deprive me
of the tenderness of your lips.
Don't speak anymore.
Nor shall I.
Kiss me, my love.
Yes, this is Hollywood.
Where, for just the price of a ticket,
they will take you anyplace
you want to go.
Anyplace that is, except one.
Seldom will they let you inside one
of those sound stages down there,
where their magic potion is brewed.
And we'll show you why.
Sometimes the good guys
are afraid of horses.
And if they're afraid of horses,
they're certainly not going
to let them use real rocks on them.
Mistreated girl, you think.
She was formerly middleweight
champion of the Marine Corps.
The lovers?
In real life,
these two are man and wife.
All right. Here we go for a take.
Would you mind not sitting on my jacket?
If I had my way, stupid,
I'd be sitting in another state!
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah!
Well, listen, nitwit!
If it wasn't for me...
If it wasn't for you?
Why, you cheap imitation of a screen extra,
I ought to smack you right in the mouth!
Lights.
Camera.
Action.
Besides everything else, you're the Very dream that I dreamed.
Aside from the behind-the-scenes
activities of the people
that are constantly seen
on the silver screen,
we would like to show you
the behind-the-scenes activities
of the motion-picture tsars
and tsaresses and their tsurisses.
Of the motion-picture tsars
and tsaresses and their tsurisses.
And so as not to make this
in any way
a completely dry
and stilted documentary,
we have acquired the services
of one the most prominent
and highly intelligent idiots available.
This is Paramutual Pictures
Incorporated.
And this is the inner working brain
of a highly successful
and wealthy company
of motion-picture makers.
And furthermore, how do you expect us to continue to be highly successful and wealthy motion-picture makers when constantly, day after day, we're losing money?
And furthermore and most important, we're not losing that money at the box office.
I suppose that's because
"MoVies Are Your Best Entertainment".
Amen.
Now. This money that I mentioned that we're constantly losing, it's here, in the studio.
And we must find out how and where it's going and who's getting it!
Now, I haVe sitting beside me
Mr. Fumble, of the distinguished firm of Fumble, Fidgett and Fuss, the famous efficiency experts.
I've asked Mr. Fumble here to help us find out why money is being wasted by some 3,000 employees of Paramutual Pictures.
In short, we need an efficiency expert to be exposed to the everyday routine of this studio and report to us any financial leak or excess spending.
Tom, dear.
You're the businessman of the family, and you've always been the smartest.
Up to now.
And you've always been the smartest.
Up to now.
But this is not the way, Tom, dear.
With due respect to Mr. Fumble, it simply will not work.
And may I ask, why?
Yes. Why?
Because this is a job for someone that nobody knows.
Well, I haVe a Very good business, and I simply will not take on an assignment that I feel we can't do our best work with.
- And therefore, I must withdraw.
- But, Mr. Fumble!
And I warn you, if this is to be a successful Venture on your part, be sure that you pick someone that nobody knows.
But nobody!
Gentlemen.
Ladies.
Someone nobody knows?
Irma Paramutual?
You've been around here since we opened the place.
Ulysses Paramutual?
No, you've been around too long too.
Albert Paramutual?
No. EVerybody knows you.
Paramutual. Paramutual.
Paramutual.
Nobody but Paramutuals.
Someone nobody knows.
Tom, I maintain that in order to get the information that you want, we should get somebody that not only nobody knows, but someone that couldn't care less about our problems, or anybody else's for that matter.
- How do you mean?
- I mean that we need somebody who is so concerned with his own problems that he won't know that we literally want him to spy for us.
And it should be somebody who doesn't care about money, who doesn't care how we spend ours or how much we haVe or how much anybody else has.
Just where do you find this sort of someone?
Frankly, Tom, I don't think you do.
The person that we want probably doesn't exist.
There just couldn't be anybody that stupid.
Yeah. There isn't anybody that stupid.
Stupid?
Hey, WeaVer! Come here.
Get him.
Yes, sir.
Hey, kid. Would you come down here a minute?
Does Hitler? What?
Hey!
- Hello, young man.
- Hello, man.
- Do you know who we are?
- The parole board?
We're the people who run this studio.
We're the Paramutuals.
Sounds like a rock 'n ' roll band.
You know, I think he'll be perfect.
What's your name, young man?
Tashman. Morty Tashman.
Morty S. Tashman.
What's the S for?
Scared. I'm frightened at a lot of things.
- Morty!
- Yeah?
How would you like to be the new errand boy for Paramutual Pictures?
- It doesn't pay much.
- But at least the hours are lousy.
Well, I don't care really about the hours or money...
- Good!
- You're hired!
Thanks a lot, but what do I do?
To be here now? To sit.
Miss O'R iley, will you send in
Mr. Sneak right away, please?
- Now, Morty.
- Yes, sir!
Your only contact will be Dexter Sneak.
Now, he's been with us for 35 years.
He's Very loyal.
- He should be, we gaVe him a watch.
- Yeah. That we did.
And, we can trust him to get us the information that you will pass on to him.
- You sent for me, T. P?
- Yes, Dexter. Come here.
Oh, Master of the Film.
Oh, Sultan of the Cinema.
Great White Father and Ruler oVer me, speak up. What is your wish?
It will be done by me, your humble and obedient...
All right. Now, tomorrow morning,
I want you to take Morty here to the Personnel Department.
- To the Personnel Department.
- Yeah.
See that he gets an interView for a job here in the studio.
Job here in the studio.
- But most important of all...
- Most important.
...see that he's hired.
- Hired, of course.
Now, I'll fill you in later on your functions with him.
My functions with...
Oh, your wish is my com...
Oh, Master of the Film and Sultan of the Cinema,
Great White Ruler oVer me...
- Oh, shut up!
- Oh, shut up!
Yeah, and take him with you.
Boy, boy, boy. Boy, boy.
Come here. That's it. See.
Send the boy...
Oh, the boy. Oh, goodness.
My function... I will... Don't you worry...
Because... Personnel...
Oh, Master...
Oh, I forgot.
Thank you Very much, sir, for the...
And thank you.
And you're also Very nice, and I...
Oh, I didn't... I mean, I got this from when I was putting...
It's just a little thumbnack.
But you can always wash it off if you haVe a hard brush.
Qualifications and your experience, the type of job you're interested in.
And you address that to Mr. Arbit, who is the head of the Personnel Department, and yes.
Well... Well, it's a Very simple procedure after that.
Oh, well, I'm sorry, everybody has to go through that.
But... Well, I don't know.
Well, I just work here in the Personnel Department. Huh?
No, you haVe to list your qualifications, your ex...
I'm just like the girl out here...
Thank you. Goodbye. Yes?
Oh, I'm Morty S. Tashman, and Mr. Sneak sent me to haVe this job.
Morty S...
Yeah, to see the Personal.
Mr. Arbit? Good morning.
Mr. Tashman is here.
- Morty S. Tashman.
- Morty S. Tashman to see about a job.
- Very good, Miss Giles. Send him in.
- Could you go right in, please?
- Thank you Very much.
- Thank you Very much.
I think that was that one. That one was bad when I came through.
Seems like everything has to be...
I'm awfully sorry,
I didn't notice that...
Oh, I'm sorry.
Would you mind if I just?
I'd like...
There's no more? That's it, then.
I can go in.
Now, when you get to the Wardrobe Department, you ask for the head,
Mr. Babewoesentall.
Mr. Babe... Who?
Babewoesentall.
He's the head of the Wardrobe.
- Benfanfinton.
- No.
- Babe...
- Well, it's hard. I'll help you.
- Say, "Babe".
- Babe.
- "Woes".
- Woes.
- "Ent".
- Ent.
- "All".
- All.
Babewoesentall.
Benpanefinton.
No. Well, forget it. Just follow me.
Good morning, Miss Giles.
How are you?
Very well, thank you,
Mr. Wabenlottnee.
I'd like to haVe you meet Morty.
Morty, this is Mr. Wabenlottnee.
Mr. Wabenlottnee, Morty.
- Hello, Morty.
- Hello, Mr. Habenoppin.
If you please. May I help you?
A lot of people haVe difficulty with that.
- It's "Wa".
- Wa.
- "Ben".
- Ben.
- "Lott".
- Lott.
- "Nee".
- Nee.
- Wabenlottnee.
- Bobbinnotten.
No, that was the other guy you wanted to meet.
- ForgiVe me, please. I must leaVe.
- I mixed up...
- I'm a little late. See you later.
- I'm sorry.
- So long, Mr. Hebbenstymin.
- Mr. Babewoesentall.
I'd like to haVe you meet Morty, the new errand boy.
Sorry, Miss Giles, I'm in an awful hurry.
HaVe him see Mr. Verdmittinin.
Yeah, but I was just practicing
Wabennabbin and then Baysentoll...
- Who should I? Vermin?
- He's the head of the other head.
All right, then I'll see Mr. Hebbin...
No, Varbinin?
Well, one of those guys. And the first thing to do is pick up a card and punch it in before you go to Wardrobe.
- Do I ask for any names there?
- No, just the card.
- Pleasure meeting you.
- Thank you, Miss Gorman.
- And a lot of luck to you.
- Worbenmebbin. Farben Memall.
Who's... Miss Gates?
Ferminillers.
Get back in line, will you?
And no talking.
Things are tough enough without suggestions and constant interruptions.
Will you please get back in line?
Now, this won't take long, kids!
All you haVe to do is go inside and get your wardrobe assignments.
You were all here yesterday, you know what you haVe to do!
Now, please try and be a little patient!
We're making a motion picture, at least we're trying to!
OK, Charlie!
All right, kids, come on, this is it.
MoVe inside now. Right away.
That's it. Hurry it along now.
I don't want to lose any time on this picture. Come on, hurry it along.
That's right. Right away.
We're gonna start right away.
Get down there, fellas. That's it.
Right down the street there. That's it.
Just keep going, right straight down.
What's the matter? What's holding?
Go ahead. MoVe it along, will you?
Come on, fellas, let's go. That's it.
All right, kids. Settle down.
Take your positions.
The same ones that you had yesterday during the rehearsal.
You know what you haVe to do.
And you know that this is a quality scene in one of Mr. Buzzbee's quality pictures.
Good morning, Mr. Buzzbee.
How do you feel?
That's good.
You get a good night's sleep?
- Rehearse! Action!
- Here she is...
- Hold it!
- Hold it!
- We make it on film!
- We make it on film!

Here she is, direct from three months of no work:
Miss Bubbles Rothschild!
Hit the music! Playback!
My blue eyes just wink for you
Hold it! Hold it!
- Hold it!
- Hold it!
- Hold it! Hold it!
- Hold it! Hold it!
He appears to be sore about something.
This is one of his precious moods.
I've never seen him so warm and kind.
Hey, you weren't here yesterday.
How come?
Well, I'm not... I'm not... I'm not...
- When they were all walking...
- Hold it!
- I'm not... I'm not...

Speed.

Oh, but I'll go away now so you can do your other moVie parts.
Oh, wack wack wack and you

Now, listen.
And listen loud!
When you guys come and go from this office,
I want you to come and go in quick order, without a lot of unnecessary chatter amongst yourselVes!
- Haskins!
- Yes, sir.
See that the Accounting Department gets these letters right away!
Lance! I...
Yes, sir.
I want you to make a pickup at T.P.'s office. Double time!
Larkin! Go down...
...to the L.A. Post office for a registered letter and sign for it, then bring it back here quick-like!
- And now, Morty!
- Yeah!
Oh, I stuck my...
- Morty.
- Yeah.
Before I giVe you your assignment...
Don't yell or hit.
- Let me make this clear to you.
- I'm going to listen to every clear.
Good, because this is
Very, Very important to me.
Yeah, I'll do all the things.
- Now, you are to take these packages.
- Packages.
- EnVelopes.
- EnVelopes.
- Papers.
- Papers.
- That other matter.
- Other matter.
- And papers.
- These all also papers?
Also these papers, and deliVer them to the addressee indicated on the outside of each item. Is that clear?
I was gonna say while you were saying it, it's Very clear.
If I see it says to go to a place,
I'll go there.
But if I don't, then it won't be clear.
Good. Now.
Now for the important part.
Now, you know, Morty,
I am a Very patient man.
I noticed before how terrific your mind is.
And it takes a great deal for me to become unhinged
- for one reason or another.
- Yeah.
But you see, when my nerVes tip me off that I'm going to become unglued, that's when I haVe to assert myself, do you understand that, Morty?
You're about to smack people, right?
That's when I haVe to assert myself!
Oh, if you just don't bang.
Is that clear?
Oh, that scared me and it's clear.
Is there more you're gonna tell me?
Because I wanna rest a second.
- Yes! Yes, there's more.
- Oh, tell me, then.
- The best part.
- Don't hit, though.
When you go out that confounded screen door, I want you to be sure...
And let me repeat this,
I want you to be absolutely sure that the screen door does not slam!
I'll be Very careful that it won't make a noise.
- Thank you!
- You're welcome, sir.
Now, pick up these packages, enVelopes and...
The enVelopes and...
- And I take them all at the same time?
- Please do.
Packages and the enVelopes.
I can take them...
I'll take the packages, and then I can carry the enVelopes at the same time?
All of the things, and I won't let that door slam.
And the let...
And all of the deliVering parts.
EnVelopes and packages...
And I'll carry all of that to the names of whatever is on the address.
I got a typewriter too.
I better leaVe the machine.
And watch that door, Morty!
Yeah. It won't slam. I was worried about the noisy typewriter.
Morty!
Don't!
That Lindbergh sure had guts, didn't he?
All the way by himself.
It's all water.
Eleven. Anyone for 11?
TwelVe. TwelVe out, please.
Let them out.
Thirteen.
Thirteen.
This is 13!
Do you smoke, ma'am?
Thank heaVens.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
I never would... I've...
You look just... I don't...
Really. Never before I...
Well, I...
Somehow I haVe a feeling it's Very close to lunchtime.
Well, so it is.
And I would judge by the grip on the lunch boxes and the amount of moisture around the lips, that the lunch bell should ring in about 15 seconds.
Now, when that bell rings, it means you haVe exactly 30 minutes to eat your lunch.
Not 31 minutes, mind you.
Thirty minutes.
Now, we usually eat right here in the office to saVe a little time.
And now,
for you ladies and gentlemen,
who enjoy early dinner music
for lunch,
it's the lovely, soft
and tender strains of Cordovan
and his world-famous string quartet
playing "Stout Grain".
You dropped your lettuce.
Oh...
And...
There are all three of them that...
That's from...
All four of them, and...
Did I see them on teleVision or what?
And that's what I thought when I...
Sandwich.
Oh, you're scared also.
Could I haVe an autograph for my tele? Family?
Hello. I was sent...
From the Production Department.
Are you the errand boy?
Yeah, I was gonna say that.
I'm the errand boy.
They told me to come oVer and relieve you.
Thanks. I'll only be a minute or two.
All right. What do I do, just take?
Oh, that's a little... I'm sorry.
I just take the checks and...
All right.
Thank you.
How do you work that?
- Hello.
- Hello.
- And what'll you haVe?
- I want 25 cents' worth of jelly beans.
Twenty-fiVe cents' worth?
Those are Very good, those bonbons.
You want jelly?
What about the? Licorice would be good, don't you think so?
A dollar a pound.
Twenty-fiVe cents, a quarter pound...
A quarter...
Here you are, dear.
Thank you.
Jelly beans. That's the best.
Boy, I've got...
Here's an extra one.
And what would you like to haVe, dear?
I would like 25 cents' worth of those jelly beans too.
That's not good to...
Twenty-fiVe...
Wonder what would happen if the woman was here.
She'd...
What happened to this?
It's not...
Well, you get extra this way, but just...
This is Very good.
Here. You can split the extra part.
With her.
It's Very hot in here.
I'll leaVe it out.
And I suppose you want 25 cents' worth of jelly beans too?
No, thank you Very kindly, sir.
"No, thank you Very kindly."
Very nice little boy. Polite.
I like children that are polite.
I'm glad. This is...
...the heaViest jellies...
All right, sonny, what would you like to haVe?
I would like to haVe 10 cents' worth of jelly beans.
Geronimo! Banzai!
You little monsters!
Cut! Cut!
Cut! Hold it! Cut!
Hold it! Hold it!
Well, you haVen't had any word from the kid yet?
There hasn't been any word yet from this...
Oh, no, no. Not a word, T.P., sir.
I see. Well, are you sure
that nobody knows anything?
And I'm sure that nobody knows anything about it...
Oh, positiVe. PositiVe, sir, T.P.
- I mean, does anybody suspect?
- Does anybody suspect?
Oh, you can rest assure, sir, that no one even knows that he's aliVe.
Now listen, and listen loud!
Listen to the man.
When you go and come out of here, we want you to come and go and get in here in short order.
Get it in, get it out.
Get it back. Get it forward.
Get it fast, get it slow. We're on a big thing. When I say go...
Right? Right. Check.
Did he see me?
Did he see me?
Kidding around, you know.
- Morty!
- Yes, sir.
Do you know where the
Stenographic Department is?
You go right out here, turn to your right, go into the building, go up three flights.
The quickest way for you to go is to make a turn...
I'm not going, you're going!
Oh, all right.
I just want to be sure you know where it is.
Yes, sir, I do.
Now, these are Very important script changes
- for Gun-fighters of the Prairie.
- Yes, sir.
Now, they need this stuff right away.
They're probably gonna shoot it this afternoon.
- So get going.
- Yes, sir.
- And Morty?
- Yes, sir?
- Please...
- Oh, don't worry.
No, don't worry, sir.
I mean, what can happen?
I'm just gonna deliVer the papers, that's all.
Morty, don't slam the... door.
They told me...
Is this where you bring all the?
They said to bring the...
Here are the papers.
They said I should bring here, this paper here, to haVe...
To haVe the papers...
Take inside...
The Gunslinging in Your Belt part.
No, I'm working on
The Sea of the Big Pirates.
Miss Herok, back there in the corner, is working on
The Gun-fighters of the Prairie.
Oh, I'm sor... Thank you.
Then I'll bring all the pages from the...
Are you Miss Hammond?
Are you the?
Are you the girl that?
Are you the girl that?
Are you Miss Har?
Yeah, well, I brought the
Gunsl... Part...
Those are blue page changes.
I only work on white pages.
I think you're gonna haVe to see
Miss Calonica.
She's oVer there.
She works on the blue pages.
Oh, all right. Then her.
That person is gonna take that.
- Yeah, she works on the blue pages.
- Oh, thanks a lot, Miss Heidenan.
You're welcome.
Well, let me get the...
Let me... I just...
Here's a bunch of them to...
I'd better... I'm s...
I didn't mean...
Well, don't look mad.
You'll get the...
Maybe a sweeper would...
Let's go.
Come on. If we're late again,
Grumpy's not gonna be as precious as he usually is.
I'm gonna finish my milk because I drink the milk.
It's the only time of the day that I haVe any energy.
That's the only...
Milk is for my teeth.
And calcium to make me...
Milk is the best.
I drink it a lot to help...
Certainly sounds different, Baron.
I can't wait to see this.
Me too. I never seen rushes before.
And this scene you mentioned, Baron, was shot only yesterday?
That's right. You see that film just as I do, for the first time.
- Wonderful.
- Well, fine.
Now, it will only take a minute, and we'll be ready.
And in the meantime, let me explain.
Now, this scene is without words.
Just music.
It's a cocktail party at one of the richest families in Philadelphia.
When the daughter comes in, finding her mother and father gone, leaVing only the guests with drinks in their hands and then...
Watch.
What is that?
Where does that face come from?
Whose face is that anyway?
- You mean you didn't plan that?
- Plan that? Are you crazy?
Look! My film is ruined!
Who is that?
Will somebody please tell me, who is that?
It is... It is kaput!
EVerything is kaput!
If film is kaput, I am kaput!
Well, what are we waiting for, Jedson?
We're waiting for the film,
Mr. Greenback.
We can't roll for a sound take unless we're in sync with the picture.
Sync, schmync. You guys are always making with the technical terms so producers don't know what you're talking about.
And if we made it sound simple, then would they know?
I just thought it would be much better if we could...
All right, roll it.
Eighty-six-five.
Goodbye, my little darling.
I'm a-gonna miss you.
Goodbye, Brett, honey.
Oh, I hate to see a cry in your eye.
Please, Brett, don't fret,
because you are my
Lover
When I'm near you
And I hear you speak my name
Softly in my ear
You breathe a flame
Lover
When we're dancing
Keep on glancing in my eyes
Till love's own entrancing music dies
All of my future is in you
You're every plan I design
Promise you'll always continue
I know, I know! What do you think
I called this dubbing session for?
She's awful. Horrible.
And I don't think she can sing either.
Now, shall we try one with the singer doing it, Mr. Greenback?
Please.
All right, everything on.
We go for a take with the other Voice.
If you're ready, Miss Hayes, we can try a take.
I'm all set when you are.
Six-five.
Please, Brett, don't fret,
because you are my
Lover
When I'm near you
And I hear you speak my name
Softly in my ear
You breathe a flame
Lover
When we're dancing
Keep on glancing in my eyes
Till love's own entrancing music dies
All of my future is in you
You're every plan I design
Promise you'll always continue
To be mine
Lover
Please be tender
When you're tender, fears depart
Lover
I surrender
To my heart
Wonderful, miss, just simply wonderful.
All right, fellas, that's a print.
Wrap it up, and that's lunch, one hour.
Good boy.
Goodbye, my little darling.
I'm a-gonna miss you.
Goodbye, Brett, honey.
Oh, I hate to see a cry in your eye.
Please, Brett, don't fret,
because you are my
Lover
When I'm near you
And I hear you speak my name
Softly in my ear
You breathe a flame
Lover
When we're dancing
Keep on glancing in your eyes
Oh, that music dies
All of my...
Well, here we are.
Helen, when you see this doctor, ask him why you're always getting laryngitis.
You've had it three times in a matter of months.
You? What are you doing here?
Well, I guess it's all right this time.
Now, Morty, it's the medical building in Beverly Hills.
Take Mrs. P. There, drop her, go get the car washed, pick her up and bring her right back here, is that clear?
Yeah, I go to the medical building in Beverly Hills, I drop off Mrs. P., then I take the car to haVe it washed, then I pick her up and come back here.
- All right, so long, Helen.
- OK, yeah.
Mrs. P., the Beverly Hills, and then I haVe the car washed, and then I haVe a medicine man fix the building.
That is a motion-picture premiere of the year.
Three years ago, if you'll recall,
Paramutual Studios turned out three of the top hits.
And one was The Tall Pain, and that was a tremendous picture.
Then came Heaven Is Far and, of course, the one you'll never forget,
Hot Heat.
Yes, ladies and gentlemen, and now, tonight, of Paramutual's biggest-of-all-time thriller, So?...
...starring Alba Kirk and Rock Pile.
Stepping out of his car is the star of that jungle series,
Mr. Brent Wood, and his loVely leading lady, Belle Flower.
Good evening. It's a pleasure to haVe you with us this evening.
Oh, and, ladies and gentlemen, stepping out of her car is the biggest star to hit the Hollywood heaVens since Baby LeRoy:
Serina! And maybe we can get her to say hello to us on this mike this evening.
Well, well, well, well, well.
Serina, you look your usual loVely self.
- Thank you, darling.
- Would you step oVer on this side so the cameras can get a better look at you? There you are.
- You certainly look your beautiful self.
- Thank you, darling.
- It's liVing a clean life, I guess.
- Serina, do you haVe the tickets?
I find early to bed, early to rise makes you keep that adorable size.
Well...
If you... Well, you can certainly say that again, Serina.
Thank you, darling.
I find early to bed, early to...
What I meant, Serina, was... I didn't mean you could say it again, I meant...
FiVe minutes.
FiVe minutes.
FiVe minutes. FiVe minutes, please.
FiVe minutes. FiVe minutes, please.
- FiVe minutes.
- Ladies and gentlemen, let me remind you that this is, without a doubt, the Very finest premiere that we haVe had here in Hollywood.
As you know, Serina has only returned to this country a short time ago, and this will be her first public appearance tonight.
While we are...
Darling, do you believe what you're watching?
This is the worst piece of junk and the lousiest performances.
Yeah...
Excitement really runs high
here tonight, folks.
We're just sorry all of you listeners
couldn't be here in person.
This is really Hollywood.
What a night.
And remember,
ladies and gentlemen, this telecast...
Come on, fellas, let's play cards.
... has been brought to you by the
motion-picture industry's best friend,
the Defunct Insurance Company
of America.
Morty!
...bring you liVe, on-the-spot coVerage of the most important happenings in America, such as the bridge championships, the semi-pro soccer matches and the annual botany show.
So until we see you folks again, this is your on-the-spot reporter bidding you all goodbye and good insurance.
Oh, darling, a little fan handed me this note.
"I hope you don't mind my writing you,
"but when I first saw you in person,
"that was the day my life was complete."
Here's the key, darling.
"My life was complete and fulfilled.
"And anybody would loVe meeting a moVie star,
"especially one as loVely, as talented,
"as great, as warm, as talented..."
Make yourself a drink, darling.
I'm going to get into something a little more...
It's a crazy!
- You sent for me, T. P?
- Yeah, come on in.
- Oh, Master of...
- Oh, shut up.
Come on, get oVer here.
And don't kiss my hand. Sit down.
- Not in my chair!
- No, sir, I'm sorry.
How about this little chair?
I'll sit right here.
Do you haVe any idea how many complaints I've had in regard to that Village idiot errand boy of yours?
- Well, no, sir, but I think...
- You think!
With what?
When's the last time you paid a Visit to that brain of yours?
You nitwit!
- But I...
- But you, my eye.
Do you realize that that? That...
That screw-loose imitation of a human being has disrupted this studio beyond control?
- I know!
- You know?
Not if you yell, I don't know.
And you let it continue?
Well, only insofar that I knew that he was working out so well for us in...
In that other little matter.
Oh? Really?
- What has he come up with?
- Well.
I knew that you wanted everything reported to you in a written statement, and I was just right in the throes of...
Oh my, that's a loVely suit that you haVe there, T. P... And, oh, that tie...
Yeah, I was right in the throes of compiling the report when you sent for me.
- Well, that's different.
- Different?
Now, you get that report to me as soon as you can.
- Oh, soon as I can.
- I hope it's half as informatiVe
- as those complaints were.
- Yes, those complaints. Yeah.
Get my secretary. Miss Clay, please.
Miss Clay. Yeah! Miss Clay.
Say, find that errand boy.
This is Sneak, first, Miss Clay. Yeah!
Well, I'm at the commissaries.
Now, find that errand boy, that Morty, and tell him I want to see him in my office right now.
Where shall I look for him, sir?
Try the alcohol jars at the studio infirmary.
But find him!
Hey, Carl. I'll get the hats and canes and you get the dummies.
OK, Ralph.
How many did they say they wanted?
I think they wanted three, is all.
OK, three it is.
Oh, thank you Very much for getting me up.
I was stuck there the whole night.
What's that?
West Coast Ding-Dong school?
- The kids?
- Yeah.
No, they go to school here on the lot when they're making pictures.
Yeah? How come?
Well, they've gotta put in so many hours during the day on lessons.
- Oh, this must be recess, huh?
- Yeah, I guess so.
That's Very interesting.
I never knew that.
Come on, we only got
20 more minutes for lunch.
- No, you go ahead. I wanna watch.
- All right.
- Hi, men.
- Hi.
Would you like a few lessons on the art of basketball?
Sure, are you gonna show us how?
Oh, sure, I'd show you.
Would you like me to show you?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
OK. My name's Morty.
You can call me that if you want to.
OK, Morty, giVe us a few lessons.
- I will. Almost through with the ball?
- Yeah.
OK, let's haVe it and step this way.
Get that, get it.
Right here. Here we go!
Oh. Get that. Hey!
The ball!
Keep your eye right on there.
Get the idea? It's all rhythm.
- Get the idea? Wanna try it?
- Yes, we do.
All right, go ahead.
- You did Very good, boys.
- Thank you.
I couldn't teach you too much, because you're Very good, boys.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
- You do this a lot, right?
- Yes.
- Yeah. Could I see the ball?
- Yeah.
- You smart alecks!
- GiVe us our ball!
Here, here, boys.
I couldn't help but see what was going on.
Now, let me giVe you all some adVice:
Let that kid haVe the ball.
What good is it gonna do if you catch him?
It's only gonna lead to an argument, and nothing ever gets solVed by arguing.
Be kind and be sweet.
You'll find out as you grow older that it's much better to agree and to adhere to all the rules that people set up.
- Mr. Durocher.
- Yes?
- Your call to New York is ready.
- Thank you Very much.
- Morty!
- Yes, sir.
Morty, I've got an itch that's driVing me crazy.
- Will you scratch my back, please?
- Your back? Yeah.
I hope no one comes in.
We look so silly.
A little higher.
I hope no one comes in.
We look so silly.
Oh, higher on the scratching.
Little clown.
Little clown.
Hello. You're Morty, aren't you?
Well, yeah, how'd you know?
The little clown told me all about you.
Oh, yeah? Oh, he's a cute little fella.
I'm Magnolia.
I'm from the Deep South.
Are you?
- No kidding?
- No, really, I'm not kidding at all.
I'd haVe never known it.
- Really?
- I swear.
I'm only teasing.
I'm from New Jersey.
- Are you really?
- Yeah.
What? Whatever brought you so far from your home?
Oh, well...
...I guess, for as long as I can remember, I wanted to go to Hollywood and see the moVie stars and the studios and all the people that made the pictures and how they made them.
And I guess it wasn't uncommon with me, like with a lot of other guys my age that liked moVies.
So I saVed up some money, and one day I got on a bus...
...and here I was, in Hollywood.
And so when I got here, I realized
I wasn't any closer to it than when I was in New Jersey.
And, as you know, when you're far away from something and you can't get to it, that's not quite half as bad as when you're close to that something and you can't get to it.
- Right?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, that's right. I think it's right.
- Yeah.
So, I guess I was just a little oVeranxious.
I was so delighted and happy about working at a studio that I...
I promised them I would giVe them the information they wanted.
And I can't do it.
I even flunked spy.
What a shame.
Well, that's not all.
From the first day that I got here,
I've done nothing but cause everybody trouble.
I didn't mean to.
It's just that I've been so delighted with working here, that I didn't think half of the time.
I'm a gofer.
They tell me to go for this and go for that.
And I can't go for this or go for that even properly.
And the only reason, I guess, they haVen't giVen me the ax is because they probably figure I'm gonna tell them a lot of things.
Well, I've taken up about enough of your time.
I'm sorry that I've bent your feathers so long, but...
Wait a minute.
- I just thought of something.
- What's that?
Well, I know I'm not terribly smart.
And a lot of people are saying that maybe I lost a couple of my marbles, but I ain't dumb.
And you don't haVe to haVe a HarVard graduation certificate...
Although it would be good to haVe that if you ever wanted to work in Washington.
To know that...
...puppets can't talk.
Well, that depends.
Can you? Can you remember when you were a little boy and your parents took you to a puppet show?
And how you'd think,
"Why, they're almost aliVe."
Or, " They made me believe they're aliVe"?
Yeah, I remember that, I do.
Well, it isn't any different now.
Especially when you want to believe what you see and hear.
So you see, Morty, you actually liked the little clown enough to take him at face Value.
You didn't stop to analyze him.
You just liked what you saw, and you believed what you liked.
Yeah.
Yeah, I guess so.
- And you know something else?
- What?
- I believe you.
- Fine.
And I like you too.
I like liking you.
It makes me feel good...
...just liking someone.
Well...
...l've gotta really go now.
Maybe I'll come by and see you again, huh?
- All right.
- Goodbye.
- Bye-bye.
- Say hello to the little clown for me.
- Oh, I will.
- Bye.
Bye.
Oh, my darling.
Oh, my loVe.
My loVe.
My loVe.
And here's to a fond farewell, my loVe.
For we shall never meet again...
...at least in this world.
But if my prayers are answered...
...maybe we will meet...
...in the world beyond.
Farewell.
Goodbye.
Cut! And print that one.
LoVely. LoVely.
You were more magnificent than
I've ever seen you, Anastasia.
- Just brilliant. Brilliant.
- Thank you, Jason.
I thought it was rather tender.
Great. Just great, Anastasia.
But then, you always are, my dear.
- Splendid, Anastasia, splendid.
- Splendid, Anastasia.
Isn't it wonderful you could wrap up the picture on your birthday?
- On your birthday too.
- Oh, T.P.
- It is your birthday, isn't it?
- It is your birthday?
- How did you find out?
- We haVe ways, Anastasia.
- Oh, yes, we haVe ways, Anasta...
- Don't we, Sneak?
- Yes, T.P., we haVe...
- Go fetch the champagne and hurry.
The present.
I'll get the present, T.P.
A little surprise, darling.
Bring this!
Turn the cameras, keep them rolling.
Roll them.
Ladies and gentlemen...
...this is Anastasia Anastasia's birthday.
Happy birthday to you, from... me and the crew.
Happy birthday, Anastasia.
Now, let's drink up that brew.
Thank you, T.P.
And thank you, all of you.
You're all so nice and wonderful.
I would like to make a sincere and honest toast.
And here's to a fond farewell, my loVe, for we shall never again meet, at least...
- But I...
- Anastasia, darling.
Never make a toast with an empty glass.
Let me fill it, and then the toast.
Oh, why, of course.
How stupid of me.
Open that, will you, son?
Yes. Yes, ma'am.
Oh, no!
Oh, you crazy kid!
No! No!
No!
What's going on here?
What's so funny?
Come on, tell me so I can laugh too.
It's absolutely the funniest thing
I've seen in my entire life.
What is? What's the funniest thing?
- What haVe you all been looking at?
- Your errand boy, that nutty kid, Morty.
That's the best comedy performance
I've seen on the screen in years.
"Performance"?
From that errand boy?
That's right, a performance, the likes of which I've never seen.
So our little New York
Method director, that's the best thing he's ever seen?
Yes, Mr. Paramutual.
The likes of which I've never seen.
And just who are you?
Just who are you, one of those
"I've been making pictures for 30 years" kind of guys?
That's not enough of a criterion for me.
You could haVe been making those pictures wrong.
Let me tell you something.
And it might be wise for you to remember it.
Anyone in the world would giVe anything to do a performance...
...because...
Because performing is nothing more than a form of expression.
But not everyone is capable of...
Of expressing themselVes openly and freely.
And therefore, only a few, only a Very few are chosen...
Chosen to communicate and express for the millions that...
That either can't, don't know how or would never get the opportunity to do so.
And those few that are chosen are called actors.
But they're still people.
And I might add, a...
A Very special kind of people.
Yes, Mr. Paramutual, that was a performance.
And giVen by one who can express what he feels, whether it be dramatic or comic, because he communicates.
Yes, he communicates.
And that's the Vitally important substance that makes great stars.
With this kid, Mr. Paramutual, you've not only got a potential great star and comedy find...
...you've got a gold mine.
- Oh, this is preposterous.
- Oh, it is, huh?
Well, you can thank your lucky stars that he's working for you, because right in the palm of your hand, you got...
Right in the palm of your hand, you haVe star material.
Someone who can make people laugh.
Now that's a quality that's difficult to define, but nonetheless, it's there on that screen.
And this kid will make you a fortune.
More money than even you'll know what to do with, sir.
"Performance". "Star material".
"Gold mine".
"Fortune"?
Sneak.
Get that boy, Morty, here, will you?
Hurry up.
HaVe you forgotten, T. P?
You had him thrown off the lot, remember?
Oh, Great White Idiot.
Yeah, yeah. All right, all right,
I'm an idiot.
But please, Sneak, go get that boy, will you? We need that boy.
Get him yourself, bigmouth.
Yeah, I'm a bigmouth, but let's get that boy,
I need him, awful bad.
Now, you know, I like him like a son.
Hello, Helen.
Hi, how are you?
Hi, Bob.
Saw your picture last night, Morty.
It was great.
Thank you, Stark.
- Babe. Woe.
- Babe. Woe.
- Sen. Tall.
- Sen. Tall.
- Babewoesentall.
- Baywumpenbum.
No, no, you didn't get it.
Hi. Hello.
Oh, good. You learned how to...
Very nice.
Oh, see you. Bye.
I mean, hello...
Hello, Helen, Lorraine. Portland.
Hi. Hi. Hello there.
Hi. LoVe you, loVe you.
LoVe you. Hi.
Well, I'll be a son of a gun.
What's that kid doing?
Hey, kid!
You're doing that all wrong.
I mean, I don't like to tell you your business, but I started this way.
Let me just come up here a second,
I'll show you what it's...
Let me show you how to do this.
It's a Very difficult job, unless you do it right.
Here, don't panic. Wait.
Hold it.
I used to do this.
I mean, that's how I started.
You don't mind if I help you or show you?
Because you're getting it all
Very mixed-up.
You gotta do this with patience.
I'll watch whatever you show me.
Mr. Grisson?
Good morning, Sister.
Got the fenders fixed. New paint job.
How does she look?
More girls arriving on the 12:02.
Is the train on time?
Sorry.
Really, a child your age smoking!
I'm not a child, madam,
I'm a midget with bad habits.
St. Francisville.
Next stop, St. Francisville and the Convent of St. Francis.
- Sorry.
- It's all right.
You going to St. Francis, too?
Would I be caught dead in this Dior creation otherwise?
That's a fact.
- What's your name?
- Rachel Devery.
No, it's not.
It's Fleur de Lis. You're half-French.
How about that? What's your name?
Kim Novak.
- I like it.
- So do I.
But I'm stuck with Mary Clancy.
- Hi. You going to St. Francis?
- Where else?
I'm Kate Davis. This is Sandy Mackey.
And I'm Rachel... I'm Fleur de Lis.
- And this is Kim...
- Listen...
I've got the most scathingly brilliant idea.
Davis.
Mackey.
Devery.
Clancy.
Reverend Mother seems to have given me the wrong list.
Well, no matter.
Anybody can make a mistake.
Even Reverend Mother.
Mr. Grisson, make sure you have all the bags.
I'm Sister Clarissa.
I'm your physical education instructor and I teach religion.
Mr. Grisson, just put them in the back of the bus, please.
All right, girls, form a line.
We already have, Sister.
Then throw out your chests and breathe in the fresh air.
- Out, out with your chest.
- It's as out as it'll go.
To the bus, girls. On the double.
Girls, there she is.
- It's positively medieval.
- All that's missing is the dragon.
Sandy Beach, Pearl Ring...
Fleur de Lis, Kim Novak.
I'm sorry, Reverend Mother, we didn't mean it. It was just...
You two may go to your dormitory. Dismissed.
I'm going to have a little talk with Miss de Lis... and Miss Novak.
- Boy, she's a fink!
- President of the club.
The way she talked to us you'd think we were criminals.
The only difference between this place and a girls' reformatory... is the tuition.
And we got enrolled instead of committed.
Dig that crazy accordion.
Come on.
- Hi, Marvel-Ann.
- Drop dead.
- Who's that?
- Marvel-Ann.
My Uncle George is her father.
He's been sending her to the nuns since she was six.
I told her she was illegitimate, so she hates me.
Is she?
Lord, no. Uncle George is very careful about that kind of thing.
I'm dying for a smoke.
- Here you are.
- Thanks.
How did you happen to get sent to St. Francis?
Well, age and money were on my parents' side. How about you?
Uncle George said he'd lay odds the nuns could straighten me out.
And what did you say?
- And I asked him, "What odds?"
- Good thinking.
Boy, I hated to leave New Trends.
It was a blast.
- What kind of school was it?
- Progressive.
Mr. Petrie's the headmaster, and he's a doll.
Sort of like Jack Lemmon, only younger.
- I love Jack Lemmon.
- Naturally.
Then why did your parents take you out?
My father said growing sweet potato plants and playing the silent piano... wasn't much preparation for life.
- Besides, I was ghastly in spelling.
- That makes two of us.
You know, maybe it won't be so bad here, after all.
I mean, you and I are certainly simpatico.
True.
What's the silent piano?
It's a long piece of cardboard with the keyboard printed on it.
And even if you had a real piano, you weren't supposed to play it.
One time, my father asked me how come I didn't play the real piano?
So I told him I wasn't allowed to.
And he said, "Why the hell not?
It's costing me $40 a month for the lessons."
And so I told him:
Mr. Petrie said that I was still crystallized... and that it wasn't time for me to come out of my cocoon yet.
Well, it's time now.
It may come as something of a surprise to you... but smoking, drinking, and similar extracurricular activities... are not permitted at St. Francis.
Get rid of those things.
You may be seated.
For some of you, this will be your first meal at St. Francis.
I hope you enjoy it.
In the future, of course, the sisters will not be dining with you.
I'm sure we all share your regret.
For the benefit of the new students...
I will clarify the rules under which we function... and introduce you to the sisters.
Sister Ursula.
Sister Ursula is our portress.
It is Sister Ursula's bell that will call you to chapel, to meals... and awaken you every morning at 6:00.
- I think I'm going to kill myself.
- Catholics aren't allowed to.
Thank you, Sister.
Sister Liguori is my assistant...
- and teaches mathematics.
- She's fun.
You'll find her methods newer than new.
That's fine, Sister.
Sister Constance.
Sister Constance is our language teacher.
She's a flawless beauty.
Thank you, Sister. Sister Elizabeth.
Art.
Sister Barbara.
Sister Barbara is head of our science department... and is also a licensed pharmacist.
So if you have any pains or aches, just go to her.
Sister Margaret, home economics.
Sister Rose Marie.
Sister Rose Marie teaches English and history... and helps raise funds for a small mission outside of Nairobi.
I have just decided to appoint her as head of our Social Action Committee.
I guess that's for picketing things.
Now, let me see. Sister Celestine.
Sister Celestine teaches music and conducts the band.
We hope some of you new girls will join the band.
Talent is desirable but not essential.
Think they can use a silent piano player?
You have all met Sister Clarissa... who is in charge of our physical education program... and teaches religion. Thank you, Sister.
There's one more sister that I would like you to know.
She no longer teaches, but is very much a part of St. Francis.
Sister Prudence.
Sister seems to be taking a nap.
Some of you may not know that St. Francis is not only a school... but the motherhouse of our order.
It's where the young sisters come for their novitiate... and the old sisters retire. We also...
As you can hear, we are sadly in need of a new boiler.
We're very fortunate that such a lovely estate... was donated to us by Mr. Walter Gaffney.
But, our order sometimes does not have sufficient funds for its proper maintenance.
Between the hour of 5:00 and 6:00 every afternoon... we ask that our students be as quiet as possible.
This is the time when all the sisters attend chapel.
It is their hour of prayer and meditation.
The Holy Cloister, which is the sisters' home... is off-limits to the entire student body.
We know that you'll respect this.
And now, we will say grace and have our dinner.
You may remain seated.
In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit... bless us, O Lord, and these thy gifts... which we are about to receive from thy bounty to...
Amen.
In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
Okay, Paul Revere's passed.
Are you sure all the sisters go to chapel at 5:00?
Yes, and they won't be back till 6:00.
- I hope it works.
- It did yesterday, didn't it?
Come on.
Maybe we'll be struck dead if we defile the sanctorum.
We did it yesterday and we're still alive.
Don't be so medieval.
You keep guard.
Okay.
All right, we're all here.
Cloister Tours will show you that mystery of mysteries... where Mother Superior sleeps.
- Isn't this exciting?
- I've never seen where she sleeps.
Neither have I.
- I can't. I'm going to faint.
- Don't you dare. Not here.
- Now I'll show you Mother Superior's room.
- Oh, my Lord.
How do you know it's Mother Superior's room?
It's got the king-size crucifix, that's how.
- Look, isn't it pretty?
- It sure doesn't look like much to me.
What do you expect for 35 cents?
Hair shirts?
Isn't it fun?
Come on, girls. Time's pressing.
Marvel-Ann, come on.
Next, we'll show you where the sisters eat, and then the novices.
- Come on.
- Step lively, ladies.
- What's upstairs?
- You'll see that later.
- Now come on, Marvel-Ann.
- I think we've been had.
I've seen enough.
Maybe we better get out of here.
Come on, don't be such a goon.
I hope the sisters' rooms are better than Mother Superior's.
- Would you stop complaining, Marvel-Ann?
- Get your hands off me!
- Big mouth.
- Now, girls, calm down.
Come on, don't push.
This is the private dining room, where Mother Superior and the sisters eat.
Come along.
- This must be Mother Superior's chair.
- Oh, yeah, God.
Well, it's not exactly the Jolly Tea Room.
All right, ladies, we're off.
Time's passing, no time to lose.
- Come on.
- That way.
Marvel-Ann, come on.
Try moving.
Now, ladies, kindly descend to the lower level.
Now, this concludes our tour, ladies.
We hope it's been a memorable experience.
Please tell your friends.
How much did we make?
$1.70. Marvel-Ann still owes us a nickel.
Try and get it. Come on, kids.
Hey, it won't open!
- It's locked.
- Trapped.
- How about that?
- You said we wouldn't be caught!
- How are we going to get out of here?
- Oh, no!
Every man for himself!
Get her!
- Get her off of me!
- Oh, Charlotte!
- Where are we going?
- I'm not particular. Here.
Here.
It's an emergency.
Boy, that was fun.
- We must do it again someday.
- Yeah.
Where is the fire?
- Come on, Ginnie-Lou, let's go.
- Watch it, Kate.
I'm sorry.
Normal.
- Are you sure?
- Yes.
- Mind you, don't burn it.
- You're burning it?
No, don't worry.
Hey, it's starting to snow.
- How's it going, Rach?
- Great. I bet I don't flunk sewing, after all.
How about that?
Maybe you ought to take up the silent piano again.
Heel-toe.
Shoulders back. Chests out. Heel-toe.
- What does this remind you of?
- Napoleon's retreat from Moscow.
Mary? Rachel? On the double.
Pick it up now, girls.
Heel-toe.
Shortcut. Heel-toe.
A glorious day.
Quiet, girls. Get ready, you're next.
Now, then. This group, pay attention.
Next we're going to try the sidestroke.
Sidestroke. Ready? Go.
- Priscilla?
- Here.
- Ruth?
- Here.
- Gladys?
- Here.
Aren't you two going in?
I've got an awful cold.
- Rash. It's all over my...
- Never mind.
- Attendance taken, Sister.
- Thank you, Valerie.
Group Three, get ready. Backstroke.
Come along, girls.
Fait accomplished.
How long do you think we'll be able to get away without going in?
Till we run out of diseases.
But we're supposed to know how to swim before we get out of here.
We've got three years.
That's a fact.
What have you written so far?
"Dear Mr. Petrie..."
- "Dear Mr. Petrie," what?
- "I'm a captive in a nunnery."
If you wanna get sprung, you'll have to do better than that.
Anyway, what makes you think he'll drive here from New Trends?
He said I could call on him anytime I needed him.
We were very simpatico.
"My parents won't do anything...
"and Mother Superior is prosecuting me."
Persecuting.
She said I'm the devil's agent.
She meant you were my stooge.
Tell Mr. Petrie... that Mother Superior is stifling your creative flow.
That's a fact.
And I'll tell him that if I don't get out of here...
I'm seriously contemplating an act of...
- Desperation.
- Yeah.
Desperation.
The only desperation around here,
Mr. Petrie, is that of the sisters... who cope with that product of progressive education... you have inflicted upon us, namely, Rachel Devery.
I hardly expect you... to completely accept New Trends' creative concept of education.
It's an abomination.
- See here, Reverend Mother...
- You see here, young man.
In the seven months that child has been at St. Francis... there hasn't been a day the sisters haven't had to struggle... with her colossal ignorance in elementary matters... as reading, writing, and arithmetic.
Not mathematics, mind you, arithmetic.
As for the social graces, I'm convinced... that your school encourages barbarism... and concerns itself only with freethinking, freewheeling, and finger painting.
The finest educational minds in the country happen to be on our side.
God is on ours.
Then what did she say to him?
I keep telling you, you don't have to whisper.
Sister Puddy could sleep through a blastoff. Watch.
- It's incredible.
- I keep testing her. It passes the time.
All right, then what did she say to him?
Mother Superior told Mr. Petrie... that having met him, she could understand me.
Whatever that means.
- And I've got to do the pots all week.
- Oh, heck.
Mother Superior said that the detergent might help to wash away my sins.
- Listen.
- What?
I've got the most scathingly brilliant idea.
"Use Bubble Charms sparingly.
"One capful makes a tubful."
Are these all their sugar bowls?
- Where did you get the stuff?
- I swiped it from Marvel-Ann.
- Won't she miss it?
- No, she never takes a bath.
"...youth quality of stirring innocence...
"invariably reproaches the world of the adult.
"The exclusively attractive charm of the young...
"makes nonsense of their sophistications.
"The poet Wordsworth, recalling his youth...
"perceived the child as prophet...
"a witness to the vision which the world has largely lost.
"The child, he says, comes from the hand of his creator...
"trailing clouds of glory.
In the morning of his creation...
"he participates in the many-splendored creativity of his maker.
"He is ingenuous, but ingenious...
"simple, yet profoundly wise...
"a hidden fountain from which bubbles forth...
"a defiance of the wrinkles of age.
"There is yet another quality...
"which endows the child with an aura of mystery.
"It is his remoteness.
"He is unfathomable in his privacy, inscrutable in his design.
"And with the philosophers of old...
"he believes there is not much one can do but bury a man.
"When the last of his..."
Those two!
Get them!
What do you have to say?
I'm waiting.
Don't you dare.
- It was my idea.
- I'm sure.
- I helped.
- Unquestionably.
Rachel, go to your dormitory.
I'll deal with you later.
- But, Reverend...
- Out!
One of us may have to go.
But I guarantee you it won't be me.
Mary, it's me.
I thought it was the enemy. You better get out of here or you'll get blasted.
What did Mother Superior say to you?
I wouldn't repeat it in this sacred place.
How long are you gonna be grounded?
I have to do the Stations of the Cross twice every day.
- How about you?
- Pots.
I think I'd rather do that, but...
Somebody's coming. Flake off.
That's what I like to see. A true penitent.
I'm sure the floor must be cold.
I think you can ponder your sins just as easily with a little help.
Thank you, Sister.
Pray hard. Math test tomorrow.
Good night, Rachel.
It's about time for the bell, girls.
Now, let's see what you've done.
That's coming along, Priscilla.
Remember, girls, freedom is the key.
Let's keep the charcoals moving.
Sheila, you've got to concentrate.
There is the model.
All right, Rachel.
Let's see what you've done.
Oh, dear.
We'll discuss it later.
All right, girls, hang up your aprons.
Clean up your charcoals.
Let's be neat.
- Are you coming, Mary?
- Yeah.
Okay.
- I'm sorry, Sister.
- I'm rather sorry you even came to class.
You'll remain and clean it up.
Listen.
What?
I've got the most scathingly brilliant idea.
I think it's a stinking idea!
- We only want to do a mask of you.
- Just your head.
Honestly, it's like being immortalized.
When you grow old, you can look at your head... and remember yourself in all your youthful beauty.
Suppose somebody comes in?
It's Saturday. Sister Elizabeth has gone to town for art supplies.
- Are you sure you know how to do it?
- Sure.
And you know what, we can sell statues of you. We'll split fifty-fifty.
Sixty-forty, or you can go immortalize somebody else.
It's a deal.
You slobs better not try anything funny.
Me, your own flesh and blood? Really!
Now, put the cap on, Marvel-Ann.
Shut your eyes.
Lovely.
- Hey, it feels awful!
- Quiet please, or we'll crack.
Straws.
Stick the straws up your nose, Marvel-Ann.
We're going to look simply marvelous.
Yeah, I can't wait for us to harden.
Give me the hammer.
- I'd better get Sister Elizabeth.
- I told you she won't be back until tonight.
Large cast cutters.
Now, Marvel-Ann, I won't hurt you.
Turn your head there a bit, dear.
- Relax, dear.
- Have you got the salve, Sister?
- Yes, coming. How's it going, Mother?
- Fine, Sister, fine.
Thank you, Sister. Thank you.
There, that was a big piece.
We're making great progress.
No, be careful. Turn your head, darling.
I'm working near this area.
Small cutter.
I'm getting near the ear.
You know I'm going to be gentle.
Almost have it now. There.
All done! There. Good girl.
I'll kill them!
All right. Settle down.
Come on, settle down.
I know it's the last day of classes, but there's still a race to be run.
First, will the winner of yesterday's daily double please step up?
Valerie.
Valerie's been in the winner's circle three times this week.
She hasn't had much competition from the rest of you fillies.
This is the St. Christopher medal today, Valerie.
Couple more medals and she can start her own church.
- Thank you, Sister.
- You're welcome.
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.
Now, it's a beautiful day at Pimlico.
This is the Preakness... the second part of the Triple Crown, and the stakes are high.
Horses are nearing the gate.
They're raring to go.
Pencils ready, girls? Ready?
This could be anybody's race.
They're off and running!
- Isn't she too much?
- She should've been a bookie.
Have a wonderful time.
- Don't forget to take your shots, Charlotte.
- I won't, bye.
Sister Liguori.
See that we're not stuck with those two for the summer.
I wish you were taking the same train.
Me, too, but mine's not till 3:00.
I hope your vacation's a blast.
- I'll send you some postcards.
- Don't forget.
From Paris, Antibes, and Côte d'Brassier.
That's the Riviera.
I'm coming!
- Goodbye, Rach.
- Goodbye, Mary.
- I nearly forgot. Thank you. Bye.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye, Mary.
- Goodbye!
Have a good time.
I'll miss you.
- Hello, Sister Prudence.
- All gone.
- How are you?
- Good to see you. Thank you for the...
I adore your hair.
- You look so French.
- Saks, $22.95.
- No.
- Listen.
We went to Monte Carlo and I met this French boy with a scooter.
French? A scooter?
Why, how old was he? Did he...
Cool it.
- Nice to see you again, girls. Rachel.
- Hello, Reverend Mother.
Mary, get rid of the bird's nest.
Not that one. That one.
Welcome back to Happy Acres.
A number of your parents have commented on the fact... that they find you singularly clumsy.
After some observation,
I must conclude they are justified.
Through your parents' generosity... we have been fortunate in securing the services... of Mrs. Mabel Dowling Phipps.
- Not bad.
- Gee, isn't she fantastic?
She will teach you how to walk and how to dance.
Mrs. Phipps has taught interpretive dancing... in a number of very fine girls' schools.
And her photograph once appeared on the cover of Dance Review.
She comes to us highly recommended.
Is there something you want to say,
Mrs. Phipps?
Yes.
You'll need $10 for leotards.
Legs apart.
Shoulders back.
Tummies in.
No. Let me show you.
You're all too clumsy, awkward, gawky.
But we'll work on that, won't we? Work.
Discipline. Twice a week.
Then in the springtime we'll put on a festival.
By then you'll all be as graceful as young willows.
Observe.
Willows.
- Isn't she wild?
- She's a blast.
- We must be willows.
- Willows.
We must be willows.
Slender, limber willows.
The first thing we must learn is to become fluid.
Fluid!
Reverend Mother, I can't do it.
I just know I can't.
I must insist.
There are no two ways about it.
I'd do it myself but I have a meeting... with Father Devlin, and I have no idea what time I'll be free.
Reverend Mother, please.
- Besides, the outing will do you good.
- But Reverend Mother...
I don't know anything about binders.
Brassieres, Sister, brassieres.
Jayne Mansfield.
Rock Hudson.
Come on, let's find you a better one.
Hey, Mary, Rach.
Did you see Valerie? It's really wild. Red.
- Here.
- That's for a cleavage.
Who cares?
- Sister, Charlotte's going to faint.
- Take off her binders.
This one. Two dozen.
That nutty swan looks just like Sister Elizabeth.
Listen, do you suppose if we watch them...
Did Sister Ursula give you permission to leave the building?
Yes.
Yes, what?
Yes, Reverend Mother. Sister Ursula said:
"Go walk in the woods. Breathe the air.
"It's good for you." So we did.
Evidently, Sister Ursula's German accent amuses you.
I didn't know she was German,
Reverend Mother.
Then surely you didn't know that during the war...
Sister Ursula kept
34 Jewish children hidden... for more than two years in the cellar of a destroyed convent outside of Munich.
And that when this was finally discovered, she was imprisoned.
She suffered untold indignities, and she...
- Are we dismissed, Reverend Mother?
- Yes.
- What's the matter?
- I hate her.
So, what else is new?
- Come on. Race you to St. Franipalooza.
- Okay.
- Come on.
- I'm coming.
Rach, wake up.
I need something I can stuff in the window.
The snow's coming in.
Rach, wake up.
I said I need something
I can stuff in the window.
I can't stuff His Holiness in a window.
I'm not gonna give you Burt Lancaster.
- Be careful, girls.
- Where shall we put it, Sister?
Put it right back over there.
Don't bump the table.
- That's coming along nicely, dear.
- Thank you, Sister.
However, I don't think we need any more of these.
Valerie, that's beautiful!
Absolutely beautiful.
Just put it right over there...
- Right over there.
- I'm sorry, Sister.
Charlotte, that's very imaginative.
I don't know what it is, but it's very imaginative.
Beautiful. Just beautiful.
- Sister Elizabeth.
- Reverend Mother.
- Excuse me. May I speak with the girls?
- Of course. Girls.
- Gather around. Quickly.
- This won't take a minute.
Because it's the holiday season...
Sister Rose Marie has baked double her usual quota of éclairs.
Sister Rose Marie's mission is sadly in need of new books.
Therefore, the price of the éclairs has been increased to 50 cents.
I knew you'd all be pleased.
Sister put the tray down. It's heavy.
Also, Sister has arranged... for our student body to visit the County Home for the Aged.
Our girls will serve refreshments, do the dishes... and entertain with songs and readings.
Naturally, this is all on a voluntary basis... so, will all of you who plan to participate please raise your hands?
Fine.
Those who remain behind may spend the day in chapel... meditating on the sin of selfishness.
Sister.
Blackmail is supposed to be against the law.
Not if it's for charity.
Sorry, Sister.
Last load.
You know how many cakes they ate?
- We're almost out of tea, too.
- Again?
You know, I used to play the Palace.
I used to have red hair when I was on the stage.
Everyone loved that color. Thank you, dear.
And red roses.
My dressing room was always filled with red roses.
Thank you, dear.
And when my husband died, everything was gone.
Money, house, everything.
Everything was gone.
...so my son said he'd come tomorrow.
He has a new car. Well, practically new.
He couldn't come last year because the children had the flu.
But this year he's coming and I'm so happy...
You know, they kept my social security?
I didn't know that they would.
They never told me they would keep my social security.
Thank you, dear.
Do you need any help, Mary?
It's a present.
Isn't he beautiful? His name is William.
Would you like to hear William sing?
- Isn't it lovely?
- Very pretty.
My children said I could come... and have a Christmas at their house.
But they didn't come.
I had gifts for them.
There may have been a very good reason why they couldn't come.
But it's Christmas, and they promised.
I did everything for them when they were little.
Nothing was too hard.
Then do one thing more.
What?
Be happy.
That's the greatest gift a mother can give her children.
It's the season of our savior's birthday and there must be no tears.
There.
Go upstairs, now. Powder your nose.
Make yourself look pretty and come to the party.
I hope I die young... and very wealthy.
Quiet, Marvel-Ann.
- Did you find out anything?
- No! I mean no.
- Didn't you ask Sister Liguori?
- I couldn't find her.
- You know what I think?
- What?
That there's no such thing as Silent Sunday.
We're the victims of a fiendish plot.
Reverend Mother just made it up
'cause she's sick of all the noise.
My hair!
You'll live.
Where are the two creeps?
That's great!
- Well, it takes practice, you know.
- I imagine.
- Try one.
- Okay.
Where did you get these?
The plumber left them.
What's the matter?
I'm not sure I like them.
So you'll have something you hate you can give up for Lent.
Yeah. Good thinking.
It's kind of smoky in here.
Give me a paper. Quick.
What's that?
Probably the end of Silent Sunday.
Don't panic, girls. Go out the side door.
The engines will be coming up the driveway.
- Keep calm.
- This way, dear. Go right along.
- Charlotte's going to faint!
- She won't faint. Get her in the air.
Keep calm, girls. Don't run. Please walk.
Walk fast, but don't run.
Don't panic. Remember the drill.
My records!
Keep calm.
Is everybody out of the building?
Sister, the sirens, I hear them.
Go along, please.
Sister Prudence, not this way, dear.
Out this way, the side door. Take Jacko.
Don't run, Sister, walk, please.
Don't come back for anything else.
There must be a fire someplace.
Sounds close.
Want to go see?
I've been giving it some thought.
Watch this.
How about that?
That's a blast.
This is the last, the final, the absolute end.
Your niece, Mr. Clancy, and your daughter, Mr. Devery... have committed their last felony at St. Francis.
For two years now, the sisters and I have endured... that which would try the patience of a saint.
And since there's been no word from the Holy Father in Rome... that he is about to bestow sainthood upon us...
I am putting an end to our martyrdom.
- Reverend Mother...
- Never in all my years have I met... two likelier candidates for San Quentin.
If I could just explain...
There is no explanation you could possibly offer me... as to why I should not expel those two criminals, and that is final!
I realize that Mary is a high-spirited young girl.
High-spirited, my foot.
I beg you to consider the fact that Mary is an orphan.
I've had to be both father and mother to my dear dead brother's only child.
I've devoted myself to her welfare, and it hasn't been easy.
And although my business affairs keep me extremely busy...
Mary naturally always comes first.
You were saying?
That there's nothing as important to me as my little niece's happiness.
And even though my business takes me... to many different parts of the world... and my affairs are extremely time-consuming, I...
I imagine they are, Mr. Clancy.
But please continue.
I'm extremely interested in hearing all about your devotion to Mary.
My devotion to her.
Well, no matter how busy I am...
I always find time for a little visit with her.
I have a feeling we're going to get bounced.
My father will kill me.
I could live with that, but it's what my mother's going to do that I can't stand.
- What?
- She'll act like a martyr.
- Hello, Uncle George.
- Don't you speak to me.
Hi, Daddy.
Daddy, sir?
For two cents,
I'd put you in San Quentin myself.
Reprieved!
And do you know why you were reprieved?
Because I'm convinced that it would be a cruel and unchristian act... to let you two loose on an unsuspecting world.
The world is not yet ready for you.
Let's go.
One moment.
Pots... from now until the end of the term... and a 1,000-word essay, double-spaced... on "The evils of smoking...
"and why I gave it up."
I was going to give up smoking anyway.
Never did like it.
Come in.
It's almost midnight, Mother.
Made a pot of tea.
Thought you might like some.
The boiler's out again.
I'll call the plumber in the morning.
We've got a big enough investment in that boiler to sell shares in it.
Stop making conversation, Liguori.
After all these years, I know when you have something on your mind. What is it?
All right.
I knew you wouldn't expel them.
It's a good thing you didn't make book on it.
You might have been taken to the laundry.
To the cleaners, Mother.
It's the point, not the vernacular, that's important.
I intended to expel them.
I was determined to expel them.
It wasn't an easy decision... but I had reached it, and they were going to go.
What they did could have had very serious consequences.
Yes, I know.
We can't permit anarchy, can we?
We can't remain passive in the face of utter disregard... for personal safety and property, now, can we?
Of course not.
Still, I couldn't do it.
I couldn't expose Mary to that man and his... secretaries.
She's still a child... and my conscience wouldn't permit it.
And Rachel?
Rachel?
Rachel has a home and parents who love her.
She's a follower, not a leader.
She can be guided.
But, Mary...
Mary has a will of iron.
To bend but not to break.
To yield but not capitulate.
To have pride... but also humility.
This has always been my struggle, Sister.
Can I be less tolerant of Mary than the Church has been of me?
Don't stay up too late.
- Good night, Mother.
- Good night, Liguori.
- Don't forget to write!
- We'll miss you.
- Peaceful, isn't it?
- Just like heaven.
Now, Mother, haven't you done enough?
It's only a week until the girls return.
Thank you. You just made my day.
All right, I'll give you a hand.
You're a fake, Liguori, and you know it.
You miss them as much as I do.
Rach!
Olé!
- Hi.
- Hello.
We went to Mexico and I bought you this.
Thank you.
It had a hat to match, but my father said it made me look like a chippy.
Whatever that is.
I brought you a holy medal from the Vatican.
It's supposed to protect you.
Thank you.
- You got a new hairdo.
- You, too.
Elizabeth Arden, Rome.
And I had my ears pierced.
Look, 14-carat gold.
- Great.
- And I saw a real bullfight.
- How was it?
- I threw up.
- Oh, dear.
- How was seeing the Pope?
Okay.
I've got some pictures of Uncle George's new secretary in a bikini. Black mesh.
- Oh, no.
- Yeah. Come on.
I'm no authority, but they still sound pretty awful.
As school bands go,
I think they're about par for the course.
Is it vanity that I want them to win the band competition?
I don't think so, Reverend Mother.
You're absolutely right. It's avarice.
We need that prize money.
I think the girls are doing just fine, Sister.
Although I must admit
I don't know how you stand the din.
I beg your pardon, Reverend Mother?
I said I don't know how you endure this...
You were saying?
I would like to have a few words with the band, if you don't mind, Sister.
I'm delighted so many of you joined the band this term.
Even those of you who, unfortunately, lack musical gifts.
She means us.
The rest of the band's not so hot, either.
As you know, we are desperately in need of a boiler.
Now, should our band win the prize... the money will be used as a down payment... on a remarkable boiler
I have just seen in a supply catalogue.
I've heard rumors... that we're going to have stiff competition... especially from
New Trends Progressive School... which is not surprising... considering the little time they devote to academic subjects and social graces.
Boy, she's got a memory like an elephant.
I know you're all going to work very hard... to prove that it is possible to be strong spiritually, scholastically... and still have a good band.
- Good morning, girls.
- Good morning, Reverend Mother.
Carry on, Sister.
How good do you think
New Trends' marching band really is?
I don't know.
- Don't you think it's important we find out?
- Sure.
What do you think we ought to do, send out a scout?
What's tomorrow?
- Saturday.
- And what's supposed to happen Saturday?
Sister Elizabeth's taking us to the city, to the art museum... and the art museum's only two blocks from New Trends.
I think it's the most scathingly brilliant idea you ever had.
How are we going to ditch Sister Elizabeth?
When she's explaining Picasso, or something... we'll tell her we just have to go to the powder room.
That is the most scathingly brilliant idea ever.
Thanks.
Aside from all other considerations, such as breaking the rules... and disappearing for three hours... so that Sister Elizabeth had to call in the police to locate you... don't you think it's highly unethical to be spying on a competitor?
I suppose it was wrong.
We did it for St. Francis.
We knew how much you wanted us to win.
And we thought if we found out how New Trends' band played... it might be good for our band's morale... and maybe we could win the prize money, and you could get the new boiler.
That's the truth, Reverend Mother, whether you believe us or not.
We just wanted to see how good they were.
I must be in my dotage, but I do believe you.
But in the future, please, will you try to remember... that St. Francis is not a training school for counterspies?
How good are they?
- They're just as rotten as we are.
- Except for one thing.
- They have uniforms.
- White slacks with purple stripes... and jackets with buttons and epaulets.
- And caps with visors. Purple.
- And white leather boots.
- Boots?
- Gorgeous.
Couldn't we have uniforms, too,
Reverend Mother?
Most certainly not.
The band will perform in their gym suits.
- Our gym suits?
- Yes.
But they are awful, Reverend Mother.
It's not as if they were like the Sacred Heart's.
At Sacred Heart's they wear short shorts for gym.
They're French.
You'll wear your gym suits.
Nicely starched, of course.
And white, satin chest bands with our school name... hand-lettered by the art class.
In gold.
Good night, girls.
Good night, Reverend Mother.
I don't know how to thank you,
Mr. Gottschalk.
You're a very generous man.
Let's put it this way:
You're a very persuasive woman,
Reverend Mother.
- I'm going to light a candle for you.
- I don't know if it'll help.
On the other hand, it can't hurt. Thank you.
Your kindness will be rewarded,
I know it will.
From your mouth to God's ear.
It's time. Here they come.
Mr. Gottschalk!
- I asked you to lend band uniforms!
- What else?
This is a Catholic school, Mr. Gottschalk!
Band uniforms are non-sectarian.
- Thank you, Reverend Mother.
- They're gorgeous!
No candle, Reverend Mother?
Perhaps a small one, Mr. Gottschalk.
We won!
Come in.
Mr. Petrie.
- Those uniforms...
- Were absolutely wonderful, weren't they?
You really must go to our Mr. Gottschalk the next time you need uniforms.
You know, I didn't think for one moment that St. Francis could win.
I hoped and I prayed, and our prayers were answered, weren't they?
I can't begin to tell you what the prize money means to us.
Would you hold these, please?
Isn't this the most beautiful boiler you've ever seen?
It's dirt-free, trouble-free, and blessedly silent.
I know St. Francis gives the impression of being palatial... and there are some very lovely things here... treasures Mr. Gaffney collected when this was his home... but the truth is the building is antiquated.
The stone floors are icy.
The hall's drafty all winter long and...
Forgive my carrying on this way.
You've had a long drive, so I'm sure your business is important.
Please, do sit down.
- You were about to say something.
- I just wanted to...
It really wasn't anything that important.
I just wanted to congratulate you on your victory, Reverend Mother.
Thank you, Mr. Petrie.
You're welcome.
And incidentally those uniforms, they were quite...
- remarkable.
- They were, weren't they?
Now, don't you be discouraged.
Someday New Trends may win the band contest, too.
- Thank you.
- Good night.
I have only one suggestion to make.
Work on your brass section.
It's quite awful, you know.
- Yeah?
- Yes.
Good night...
Reverend Mother.
I'll be back in a little while, dear.
Try and get some rest.
Mary, it'll be such a drag for you here over Christmas...
- I wish you were coming home with me.
- So do I, Rach.
But I couldn't leave Gargantua here alone.
- Good afternoon, girls.
- Good afternoon, Sister Margaret.
Sister Margaret?
- How are the mumps, Marvel-Ann?
- Drop dead.
That's gratitude for you! Come on.
Merry Christmas.
- It's 9:00, you nut.
- I don't care, go away.
You know you won't have time to finish that dress before the contest.
I will. I'm not going to be the only one who's not in it.
We had meatballs tonight, in case you are hungry.
I don't care if I never eat again.
Now go away.
Boy, what a grouch.
Rach, come on.
No, I'm going to finish it if it kills me.
Now go away.
All right.
Starve!
Darn old machine.
It did it again.
What are you doing? It's after 11:00.
Sister Margaret said I could stay and finish.
I know, but not this late. It's...
What is it?
A cocktail dress.
However did you manage to make it come out looking like this?
I didn't. It just happened.
Do you have more material?
All right, rip.
- Mary.
- Rachel wasn't...
She fell asleep. So I thought
I'd let her rest for a few minutes.
Must be after midnight.
It's nearly 5:00, Reverend Mother.
So it is. My, my.
It looks beautiful.
It is nice, isn't it?
I used to do a great deal of sewing when I was a girl.
I always blessed my mother for insisting that I learn how to handle a needle.
When my parents died, I was 16 then...
- my uncle who lived in Paris...
- Paris?
Paris was my mother's home... before she immigrated to Quebec and married my father.
I lost my parents within three months of each other.
Flu epidemic.
Anyway, I went to live in Paris.
My uncle arranged for my apprenticeship with a well-known couturier.
Of course, I was only a seamstress.
But I had visions of creating my own designs... in the house of Madeleine Rouche challenging the great Chanel.
That was my name, Madeleine Rouche.
I remember standing behind the curtains with the fitters... when the collections were shown.
The buyers came from all over the world.
Many times, as I watched the models display the gowns, I'd think... now I would have done that one differently... used a different fabric... something that had more movement, more mystery...
I know it's vanity, of course. But I think
I could have made a success of it.
But how could you give it up?
I found something better.
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.
Rachel...
I'm sure you want to contribute the $10... to Sister Rose Marie's mission fund.
And I know you want Sister Margaret to have these.
Thank you.
But I absolutely insist that you keep the entire box... of lovely threads for yourself.
Thank you, Reverend Mother.
Victim!
Rescuer!
I have a feeling we shouldn't have cut swimming for three years.
- Think positive.
- Oh, sure.
- What do you think we ought to do?
- Pray.
Sister Clarissa won't let us drown.
I wouldn't count on it.
Victim!
Rescuer!
After you.
Victim.
I'll let you know if my whole life passes before me while I drown.
Don't bother, I'll find out for myself.
Help!
She can't swim, she's drowning!
That's the idea. Get in.
Hang on, Rach, I'm coming.
Help!
I can't swim either.
How's the water, Sister?
I wonder if my father knows he's paying good money... to have me educated to be a janitor.
- It's better than doing pots.
- I guess so.
I still think that was a pretty dirty crack
Reverend Mother made.
Which dirty crack of several hundreds are you referring to?
That anyone who survived as many exotic diseases as we have... ought to will their bodies to science.
I told you, you can only get malaria in the tropics.
If there are anymore St. Francises in here,
I'll kill myself.
Mary, look at this.
I don't believe it.
- Sister Constance is leaving?
- How about that?
I bet her lover, who went off to war or something... finally found her here, and now she's going to give up being a nun.
You always said she was a flawless beauty... and it was absolutely criminal for her to be trapped into being a nun.
I'll empty the wastebasket.
You could start padding the posters.
- Okay.
- I'll be right back.
- Good afternoon, Sister Constance.
- Hello, Sister Constance.
- Sister Constance.
- Well, what are you doing?
- Penance in the art class?
- You're going away.
Yes. I don't know how you know about it.
But I am leaving, right after your class graduates.
- But how can you stop being a nun?
- Stop being a nun?
Wherever did you get such an idea?
- Aren't you?
- Heavens, no.
Mary, this isn't just a club you resign from.
You see, I'm going to the Philippines.
There's a leper colony there and I'm going to teach the sick children.
But suppose you get it? You're so beautiful.
It's so unfair that they should send you to a place like that.
But I asked to be sent, Mary.
They need teachers very badly.
The disease is controlled and much less dangerous than people think.
But suppose you do get it?
Then I'll pray
I'll have the strength to endure.
I want to go, Mary.
- You really do?
- Cross my heart.
- You're really happy about it, aren't you?
- Very happy.
What are you so solemn about?
God's in his heaven.
All's well with the world.
Cheer up.
- You sick, or something?
- No.
Then what's the matter?
Nothing.
- Rach, listen.
- You've got a scathingly brilliant idea?
- No.
- Then what?
There's only four weeks to graduation.
How about that?
I'll miss you, Mary.
I'll miss you, too, you old nut.
Thanks.
I think we ought to get some sleep.
- 6:00 comes awfully fast.
- Yes.
- Good night, Rachel.
- Good night, Mary.
- It's 8:00.
- Bell didn't ring, go to sleep.
It's 8:00, and Sister Ursula didn't ring the bell.
Oh, no, 8:00!
Maybe Reverend Mother cooked up another Silent Sunday.
It's Tuesday, you goon.
A little thing like that wouldn't faze Reverend Mother.
- Good morning, Reverend Mother.
- Sister Ursula didn't ring the bell.
- Honest, Reverend Mother.
- That's true.
There will be no classes today.
There's been a death among the sisters.
Sister Prudence, Reverend Mother?
No, Sister Liguori.
- Sister Liguori!
- Reverend Mother, what happened?
Her heart... She died in her sleep.
Those of you who wish to pay your respects to Sister Liguori... may do so after her family has departed.
Will you all dress now, please?
And be as quiet as possible.
How can she be so cold?
Father Devlin, who administered the last rites, will offer Mass.
Rosary will be recited tonight at 7:00.
- Thank you, Reverend Mother.
- You've been very kind.
Well, Liguori... this is the last race... at Pimlico.
All right, girls, quiet down now.
Hands folded in front, hold still, have a pleasant expression.
Hold it.
Lovely. Now come and get your bouquets, girls.
There you are, Sister. Thank you.
Take it over there.
All right, girls. Get your bouquets.
That's it.
You look just lovely.
- Sit down.
- Just lovely.
All right, that's it.
- Sister Constance, Charlotte's going to faint.
- You hold her, just a second.
No, she isn't. Here we are, smelling salt.
There. Do you feel better?
- Thank you, Sister.
- Good.
Your attention, girls.
You are all remarkably beautiful.
In a few moments, you'll go through these doors... graduate, and begin a new life away from St. Francis.
I hope that you will remember us with love, as we shall remember you.
It is our custom at this time, just before graduation... to announce the names of the girls who have decided to enter our order.
The decision to serve God is not an easy one... but it is a joyful one.
And I hope you will share this joy with the two girls... who are going to remain at St. Francis, and begin their novitiate.
The girls are: Sheila Michaels... and Mary Clancy.
- Mary, congratulations.
- Mary?
No.
Rach...
Time.
God bless you all.
Make sure you get all the bags now.
The train will be pulling out any minute.
My love to your parents.
In three weeks, dear.
We'll be looking forward to it.
Bye bye.
Rachel, Mary's very upset that you won't speak with her.
There's nothing to say.
She's a traitor, she was brainwashed.
- Someday you'll understand, Rachel.
- No, I won't. Never.
Won't you at least say goodbye to her?
She's your closest and dearest friend.
She's made a difficult and courageous decision.
It wasn't her decision.
Yes, it was.
Rachel, look at me.
It was her decision.
You, of all people, should know how strong she is.
She didn't yield, Rachel. She chose.
And I'd rather have one like Mary who chooses, than 100 who yield.
You know, she has so much to give.
All our sisters do, but Mary will give with joy and laughter.
And defiance, I imagine.
In fact, I have a feeling that someday, many people... even those in the highest places... will know that Mary Clancy came our way.
She has some scathingly brilliant ideas.
- Goodbye, Reverend Mother.
- Not one word for Mary, Rachel?
No.
Rach, please!
You could've told me.
Why didn't you tell me?
You don't know how much
I wanted to tell you.
I hope it's wonderful. Honest, I do.
Boy, you'll make some crazy nun.
How about that?
Uncle George nearly died when I told him.
All aboard!
- Will you write to me?
- Of course!
Just because I'll be a nun doesn't mean I can't write to you.
- All aboard!
- I got to go.
Arrivederci!
- Goodbye, Reverend Mother!
- Goodbye, Rachel.
Goodbye, St. Francis!
- Goodbye, Mary.
- Goodbye, Rachel.
All right, young lady.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
Who knows, Reverend Mother... maybe one day Rachel will come back and join the order.
If she does, I quit.
- Good night, John.
- Good night, milord. Good night, milady.
- Good night.
Excuse me, sir. Is that
Lord Glenarvan's yacht?
- It is.
- Well, we'd like to see him, please.
Oh, would you, now?
He'll be horribly hurt to know... you didn't arrive for the start of the party.
We didn't even know about it.
I bring news of one of his ships, disappeared at sea.
A message from Captain Grant of the Britannia.
Captain Grant?
Why, he's dead, isn't he?
And just how would he get a bottle where he's at?
- Go on. Get on with you.
- Captain Grant's our father, and he's not dead.
I'm Mary Grant, and this is my brother, Robert.
Oh, no offense intended, miss.
He was a good man, he was.
The best this line ever had.
It's just that it's, uh, hard to take serious. The note in the bottle, I mean.
Still, I-I suppose it could happen.
And that's why we just have to see his lordship before he sails.
Oh, I'm sorry, miss.
I've had my orders.
Nobody aboard except invited guests.
But we've come all the way from Plymouth today. It has cost me my last franc.
And we haven't had a thing to eat.
So that's it.
Another trick, is it?
Get out of here with your wild tales, your hard-luck stories.
You almost had me taken in for a minute.
Go on. Stand clear of the gate there.
Come on, Robert.
- Lovely.
- Good night to you.
You two, come back here!
Come back, I said.
You children, come here at once.
- Did you hear me?
- Good evening.
- Come back, I said!
- Good evening.
- Come back at once!
Come out now, matey, wherever you are.
You wouldn't want me to lose my bloomin' job now, would you?
- How do we get past this one?
- Good night, sir.
Oh, very simple.
Just walk nonchalantly... up the plank backwards.
Yes, with all the confusion... he won't be able to tell you from the departing guests.
Go on now. Go on.
Good night, sir, madam.
Good night, sir.
Good night, sir, madam.
- Come on.
- You now.
Go on. Go on, go on!
Good night, sir.
Good night.
Little boy, would you be so kind as to get my wrap for me?
- I think I left it in the salon.
- You children, what are you doing there?
- Stop those children!
- Evening.
- Come back, you two!
- Good evening. Good evening, sir.
Come back. Stop, you two!
Come on. Stop!
Come back, you two.
Come back!
- May I give you some more turkey?
- Thank you.
- Not too much.
- The salmon is delicious.
I hear Lord Glenarvan is going to Venezuela again this year.
Yes. He so much enjoys the seasons.
How long does he plan to be away this time?
He seems very proud of this new, uh, steamer.
Good evening.
Uh-Uh, cloves from Madagascar.
It is not bad for English ham.
Oh, excuse me, madam.
There's someone under the table! Look!
There they are!
Head them off the other way.
Steward! Steward!
Up there on the deck!
- Oh, let me go!
- Why?
Come back, you two! Come back!
Oh, come here.
Come here now, then. I got you!
- I got you!
- Oh, let me go!
- You leave him alone!
- Oh!
Oh. It's you, your lordship.
- Isn't it?
- I dare say, but who are you?
- Oh, please, your lordship, we must speak to you.
- We've come all the way from Plymouth.
- I'm Mary Grant, and this is my brother. Our father's Captain Grant.
- On the Britannia.
- And he's alive. And you must send a ship to bring them back.
- With two of his men.
- As quick as you can.
- Now, just a minute.
Come along.
We'll talk it over.
Now, then, how do you know your father's still alive?
- He put a note in a bottle.
- And a French professor...
- Monsieur Paganel, he found it.
- Oh-Oh, that again.
- What do you mean?
- My dear children, ever since...
I posted the reward for news of your father's ship... people have been turning up with notes they claim to have found in bottles.
- How many is this, John?
- Uh, 22, Father.
If I had my way, every last one of the culprits would be hanged from the yardarms!
Exploiting human misery, that's what it is.
Nothing more vicious, more treacherous.
But it is from my father.
I can tell.
Monsieur Paganel, show them the note you found in the bottle.
Voilà. Oh, I'm-I'm sorry.
Wr-Wrong bottle.
Ah, this is the one.
First question always, where'd you find the bottle?
Well, y-you see, milord,
I-I went fishing with some students.
And I suppose you cut open a fish and found the bottle inside.
Oui, oui, milord, a 220-pound shark!
Osborne, throw this man off the ship before I turn him over to the police.
- No, your lordship.
- But it is the truth, what I tell you.
Ridiculous. Why should a shark want to swallow a bottle?
Oh, what was in his mind,
I-I-I don't know.
I-I tell you only what was in his stomach.
You make a career of this, do you, exploiting children?
I am Jacques Eliacin
Francois Paganel.
Professor of geography,
Université of Paris.
My credentials, milord. Oh!
Forged, I imagine, like the note in the bottle. All right, steward.
Come along.
- Oh, no, your lordship, you can't!
- Monsieur Paganel's our friend.
Just a minute, children.
I have something to say to you.
If we could be alone for a moment.
Take your hands off me, messieurs.
Never have I been thrown from anyplace in my life.
Let's not set a precedent.
My dear children, don't you think
I'd be the first to respond... if I thought there was the slightest chance of finding your father... or any of his crew alive?
I'd go to the ends of the earth, and that's no idle boast.
The Glenarvan motto:
''Persevero. ''
It's been the family creed for 800 years.
But it's not a hoax. I saw the note myself, and I know my father wrote it.
The way he makes his letters.
I can tell.
Just a little more clever than the rest, that's all.
When you consider the odds, it would be fantastic just finding the bottle.
But this business about it being swallowed by a shark--
Well, what would my father have to do?
Come back here himself and say...
''Yes, I wrote the note.
Now come and find me.''
Did I understand you to say you came all the way from Plymouth?
Tell Osborne to get cabins ready for 'em. We'll drop them off there on the way.
- Very well.
- But what about Monsieur Paganel?
- We can't go off here and leave him.
- Now, my dear, I'm only doing what's best for you.
Now, then, how'd he get past you in the first place?
Well, how did he get past you, if it comes to that?
Now, wait a minute.
Oh, here's his lordship's wine.
- And about time too.
- A bit late, aren't you, Charlie?
It'll be a pretty rough trip if his lordship doesn't get his wine.
Uh, follow me, please.
This way, miss. Cabin number five on the starboard side.
Of course, Richard's a lot older than you.
Maybe not actually in years, but--
Oh, he's been around more.
I don't know what you mean by that.
After all, there's probably nobody else in the world my age... who's made as many trips to the Mediterranean as I have.
Well, that's just it! I mean... have you ever been to, oh,
South America, for instance?
As a matter of fact, no.
- Pacific Ocean. Ever seen that?
- It's only an ocean.
Perhaps you should have waited and had breakfast with my father.
He's the one who'd have to give the order to change course for South America.
Oh, he would go.
Nothing could stop him... if it were for something you could really believe in... and not this note in a bottle.
Let me ask you something. If you were a castaway and you had a bottle... wouldn't you put a note in it and throw it into the sea?
Oh, I don't think so. After all, it's such a small chance, isn't it?
Well, what would you do, then?
Just sit there with the empty bottle until you died or something?
All right. I suppose I would try it.
But I wouldn't expect someone to find it inside a shark.
Well, if that's where they did find it... you wouldn't expect them to just forget about you, would you?
You never saw that Frenchman before in your life... did you, until he showed up with the bottle.
And yet, you believe every word he says.
And no matter what he says, you and your father refuse to believe him.
Suppose I told you that I'd found a bottle with a note in it.
- Would you believe me?
- Well, did you?
- Yes.
- And what did it say?
It said:
''Disregard first message.''
Oh, I suppose you think that's funny, don't you?
You've got your father, so to you this is just a big joke.
Now, wait a minute.
I'm not making a joke of it.
- I'm just trying to show you.
- Please, do you mind?
- I'll make you an offer.
- What kind of an offer?
I don't necessarily believe this story about the shark swallowing the bottle.
But I am getting a little fed up with these infernal trips to the Mediterranean.
Down, boy. Good old boy. I'll bring you a bone or something later.
That's a good boy.
Oh, uh, bonjour.
In case you've emptied your own pockets.
And just don't let any shark get this away from you.
Thank you.
I assure you, mademoiselle, your case shall be properly presented.
After all, Father, suppose it was you cast away.
Do you think I would give up if I had even the slightest clue?
I'd live up to all the legends of Glenarvan. Persevere, if I had to move heaven and earth.
- Why don't we try Corsica for a change?
- Father, will you listen to me?
- Haven't been there for years.
- Suppose you were a castaway and you had a bottle.
You wouldn't just sit there staring at it until you died or something, would you?
You'd at least try putting a note into it.
And suppose for some strange reason it did get swallowed by a shark.
- Most unlikely, I'd say.
- Very well, then.
If you won't listen, I shall be getting off at Plymouth with Mary and Robert.
- Oh, come, come, come, come.
- I feel very strongly about this,
Father.
My dear boy, if that's the way you feel about it, let's have a look at the blasted note.
- Where is it?
- In the bottle.
- Well, where's the bottle?
- The Frenchman has it.
- Confound it, where's the Frenchman?
- You had him thrown off the ship in Glasgow.
- That's a fine thing.
When I really want something, no one takes the slightest notice.
- If I happen to drop a casual remark--
- Casual remark?
''Throw him off the ship before I call the police!
We ought to hang him from the yardarm.''
Now we're in a deuce of a fix.
That Frenchman might be anywhere by now.
Where's Captain Mangles?
Tell Captain Mangles to-- Oh!
- Oui, milord?
- Good gracious, the Frenchman!
- I thought--
- Oh, but I give you my word,
I was put off the ship.
Fortunately, I do not let such things upset me.
The note, milord.
Well, this is useless. There's practically nothing of it left.
Ah, but with a little study, a little intelligence... it is possible to make out what is said.
You will see one thing w-without question.
Their location is given as 37 degrees...
11 minutes, southern latitude.
That's no good without the longitude.
Consider first, milord, on the 37th parallel... there are only a few places they could be.
That's what I've always said.
If Captain Grant's anywhere at all, he's in Australia.
It's only logical, monsieur, if you know anything about shipping and commerce.
Use the head, milord.
The note makes reference to being captured, no?
And you can make out the word
''Indian'' or ''Indians.''
So where on the 37th parallel would they be captured by Indians?
- Australia, of course!
- Aboriginals, yes. Indians, no.
By George! I've got it. South America.
Couldn't be anywhere else.
And if he was captured by Indians, he'd be on the West Coast.
It's a matter of simple logic, monsieur.
We'll go there and follow the 37th parallel over the Andes... until we find Captain Grant.
Osborne, find Captain Mangles!
Tell him I'm going to change course.
- Thank you, milord! Thank you!
- Oh!
- Now, just a minute.
Don't forget that it was me who arranged--
- Thank you!
- Thank you, milord!
- Thank you, milord!
Oh, please!
I'm an Englishman, you know.
There, milord, is where we must go.
The pass of Antuco.
Then follow the parallel until we find Captain Grant.
Ha, jolly good trick to throw a bottle into the ocean from up there, I must say.
Ah, but could he not put the bottle into a river?
And would it not flow down to the sea, eh?
No, no. Grimpons.
- Grimpons.
- That means ''let's climb.''
It is the French recipe for the good life.
Whatever you want to do, don't be afraid to do it for fear of failure.
Don't be afraid of the beautiful and high mountain
- Let's climb, let's climb let's climb, let's climb, let's climb
- Let's climb, let's climb, let's climb
Don't be afraid of the beautiful and high mountain
Let's climb, let's climb, let's climb
Let's climb, let's climb
And if we fall, crash, bang
And die a terrible death
Never mind, we've had the joy the joy of the climb
Oh, don't be afraid of the beautiful and high mountain
Let's climb, let's climb, let's climb let's climb, let's climb
Let's climb, let's climb, let's climb let's climb, let's climb
Let's climb, let's climb, let's climb
Let's climb, let's climb
Oh, look! Look!
Straight down that valley there.
- Where?
- Do you see it, milord?
A river into which one might throw a bottle.
- By Jove, yes!
- And an Indian village.
I'd say, this could be just the place, couldn't it? Have a look, my dear.
Better make camp here tonight and get an early start in the morning.
Hey, you, make camp.
Stay here tonight.
- No stay.
- Huh?
- What's the fellow talking about?
- Ah, it is not Spanish.
It must be a local Indian term.
Hey, hey, hey.
What means trango peeray?
Oh, I-I-I-I-I think he-he wants to tell us... it gets, uh, terribly cold up here.
Oh, we build a fire, no matter how cold.
No matter how trango peeray, we stay in hut.
- No stay.
- Listen to me.
I tell you when to go and when to stay.
- No stay.
- We stay here tonight!
- You stay. We go.
- Don't you dare to try and tell me!
I think the fellow really means it.
Well, that's done it.
Without the horses, we're helpless.
- We'll never make it.
- Well, can't we still go on on foot?
But of course, mademoiselle.
The Araucanians have... crossed these mountains on foot for hundreds of years.
- Even drive their sheep.
- Oh, good!
- When do we start?
- We're not gonna start.
I'm not gonna go leaping about like a-- like a confounded mountain sheep, thank you.
- Oh, please, your lordship, please!
- No, no, mademoiselle. Uh, he's right.
Uh-Uh-Uh, we-we'll, uh, return to the ship with the Indians... and get some crewmen who are younger.
- Age has got nothing whatever to do with it.
- I'll take over and lead the-the expedition.
You-You-You can remain in your deck chair.
You lead the way? Ridiculous! Have the whole lot of you lost in no time.
On the other hand, with me in command... it would take a great deal more than, ha, trango peeray to turn us back.
- That's right, isn't it?
- Right, your lordship.
Monsieur Paganel, do you think we might have one tonight?
When you are in the poultry yard, it is a good time to wish you catch the egg.
See? Look at this. See?
Any slight tremor of the earth, and it starts to swing.
But if you're asleep, how could you tell?
Oh, maybe all night I sleep, uh, with one eye open.
Perhaps his lordship will sleep better... if we do not tell him before tomorrow... what trango peeray means, eh?
Your pleasure, mademoiselle.
Castaway, castaway
Trust in your star
You know I will find you
Wherever you are
Though all your dreams
May be tossed by the tide
Cling to your hopes
Never cast them aside
Castaway, castaway
Though you may be
Lost in the wilderness
Over the sea
I will discover
Your castaway shore
Then you'll
Be a castaway
No more
You'll be
A castaway
No more
It's my father's favorite.
E-Ever since I was a little girl,
I've always thought it sad.
Not the way you sang it.
Oh, it's just the way I feel tonight, I suppose.
Oh, it's all so exciting.
We're up here.
Father's down there.
The stars pointing the way.
It's almost like being in heaven.
- I know.
- Ah, there you are, my boy.
Better get some sleep, you know.
Got an early start.
- We're too excited to sleep.
- Mm, so I see.
You'd better come along with me, just the same.
Wait. I want to make a wish on that star.
What could you wish for that you haven't got?
That my father would go somewhere and get lost.
Just for a little while, you understand.
- What on earth are you doing?
- This is to wake me up.
- Wake you up?
- Yes, in case--
- In case what?
- Oh, nothing.
- And what is this, may I ask?
- My watch, milord.
Perhaps I want to look at it during the night.
How very peculiar.
Oh, Robert, really.
Do put those things away.
But if there's an earthquake,
I want to be sure and see it.
Earthquake? Who said anything about an earthquake?
Oh, I'm so stupid, milord.
I didn't realize it until later.
The Indian, when he did, uh-uh-uh, that, you see?
He did not mean it was cold. No.
He meant trango peeray-- earthquake!
- This is the land of many earthquakes.
- Good gracious me.
In the whole world, no place has such big... such beautiful, such magnificent earthquakes as right here.
But it is one chance in a million we should be so fortunate.
Yes. Yes. Yes, of course.
Quite right.
Besides, this place looks as if it's been here for hundreds of years.
Doesn't it?
I mean, uh, it's safe to assume... that it will last one more night, eh?
- Oui, monsieur?
- Oui, milord.
And I'll wake you up if one comes, your lordship.
- It worked!
- Oh, Robert, do be quiet.
An earthquake of the first magnitude.
I say, do you have to shake the whole place?
By Jove, it's an earthquake!
Outside, everybody!
Oh! Oh, magnificent!
This is an experience that makes our entire expedition worthwhile.
By Jove, that was a narrow squeak! Oh!
I say, this is getting rather dangerous.
Then we attempt to change course.
Everybody to port.
- It worked!
- That's better. Much obliged.
- Look out! Look out!
- This way, everybody, quick!
To the port, quick!
- What the-- Port, quickly!
- No, starboard!
- Port, I say!
- Starboard!
Where are we going now?
- Perfect timing.
- Oh!
- Abandon ship!
- No! Wait!
- There's a hole in the ice!
- But we don't know where it goes.
We'll soon find out.
Alpine-type glacier.
Drift minimum.
We'll never get out of here alive.
The ice melts and gets out.
Why can't we?
- Isn't it beautiful!
- Oh!
They'll never believe us when we get home. If we get home.
Look out, everybody! Duck!
Where--
Where're we going now? Ooh.
Try starboard, I tell you!
- This is most peculiar.
- Look out!
- That was close.
- Oh!
Mary!
Come on!
- Where's Robert?
- Here's his hat.
Robert! Robert, can you hear me?
Not down there.
I'm up here.
Oh, a giant condor.
A Sarcohamphus gryphus.
Robert, hold on!
I don't have to.
She won't let go.
This is true. She will not let go until she reaches her nest.
- Reaches her nest?
- Yes, high in the mountains.
No doubt she has little ones that must--
Hang on, Robert.
We're coming!
- Robert!
- I got dizzy coming down... but it was a jolly good view from up there.
- Oh, thank goodness you're all right.
- I wonder who fired the shot.
Perhaps he did.
A Patagonian. Magnificent!
It's like turning back the history book hundreds of years.
Hope he's not dangerous.
Permit me. I-I've learned a few primitive words.
Anyway, even if you don't understand...
I-I want to thank you for saving my brother's life.
- Happy could do.
- Heavens, he speaks English.
First-class shooting, sir.
First time, right through the heart.
No. Shoot through heart... bird go limp, drop small boy.
But shoot back of head... bird go stiff, wings go up.
He circle down, land boy safe.
Y-You mean, you-you purposely... i-induced motor paralysis through damage on the medulla?
- Not understand.
- Neither do I.
- Can you tell us where our father is?
- He was captured by Indians.
- On the 37th parallel.
They were kidnapped, washed up on the shore, captured.
Three white men.
Indians hold them for ransom money.
- You very slow to come.
- Are they all right?
Last time I hear, they are well, but very tired of being prisoners.
Just a minute. What do you mean,
''last time you hear''? Don't you come from the village where they're held?
No. I'm an Araucanian chief,
Thalcave.
My people do not rob, do not steal, do not hold prisoners for ransom.
- Well, where are they?
- Far away, at the foot of the mountain.
Great plain reaches far as you can see.
- Many days to cross.
- The pampas.
Well, couldn't you take us there?
First we stop at my village for horses and supplies... then Thalcave will try help you find them.
Much rain there.
You sleep in tree. May come flood.
Flood? By George, that's a good one.
A giant ombu tree,
Phytolacca dioica.
- Magnificent specimen.
- Oh, please, may we sleep in it?
You can sleep where you like, but I certainly don't intend to roost... in a tree like a confounded sparrow.
Pitch my tent just here.
You in tree, listen!
Flood come. Much water.
You stay in tree. I bring help.
- My father?
- I wake him.
To be safe, we tie things so they do not fall.
Flood come. You go quick to tree.
I ride for help.
Not even raining.
Just like on a ship.
Make ready for the storm.
Look! The flood!
- Father! Father!
- John, be careful!
- Father, hurry up!
- Now what's going on?
- Come with me!
Can't a fellow get a decent night's rest in this place?
- Come on, Father!
- Oh!
Come on.
They've got it!
Hold on!
Highly irregular, flood like this-- and not even raining.
With some food in your stomach, milord, the world will feel a lot brighter.
- Oh! Look out below!
- Oh!
Sorry, milord.
Why cry about bad weather
Enjoy it
Each moment is a treasure enjoy it
We're travelers on life's highway
Enjoy the trip
Each lovely twist and byway
Each bump and dip
If there's a complication enjoy it
You've got imagination employ it
Then you'll see roses in the snow
Joie de vivre will make them grow
Voilà, that's life
Enjoy it
Since I must do the cooking
I'll enjoy it
This ombu tree smells gorgeous
You'll enjoy it
A hurricane comes your way enjoy the breeze
You're stranded in the jungle enjoy the trees
If there's a complication enjoy it
You've got imagination employ it
This tree's a cornucopia
Why, it could be--
- Utopia
- Voilà, that's right, enjoy it
Why cry about bad weather
- Enjoy it
- No, enjoy
Oh, each moment is a treasure
Enjoy it
- That's better. Enjoy it.
- We're travelers on life's highway
Enjoy the trip
Each lovely twist and byway each bump and dip
- Good.
- If there's a complication
- Enjoy it
- Enjoy it
You've got imagination employ it
Employ it
From eggs and herbs au naturel
Omelette ombu a la Paganel
Pour vous, milord
Enjoy it
Voilà!
Robert, can you see anything... that looks like an Indian on horseback coming to our rescue?
- Only some birds.
- Only some--
Only gone down half an inch in two days.
We'll be here for 10 years at this rate.
Cheer up, milord.
We pay no rent.
Mother Nature sets the table for us.
And, fortunately, we have plenty of water.
That's very fortunate,
I must say.
- Very fortunate.
- My father will never trust another Indian.
But Thalcave's different.
He said, ''I bring help.''
- And he will.
- If he got through.
Don't even think such things.
All right.
But if I may paraphrase... what a wise young girl once said to me many years ago:
''If you were marooned in an ombu tree... and you had some logs and something to tie them into a raft... you wouldn't just sit there until you died or something, would you?''
That's very good.
For a girl, I mean.
I suppose most girls are taught embroidery and things.
But Mother died after Robert was born.
And Father, being a sea captain--
When we first met,
I had a different impression.
Most girls can be rather silly.
Do you know what I mean?
- No, I don't.
- Well, you're different.
- How different?
- I don't know how to say it.
I had it all worked out last night.
Sounds rather silly now, though.
- What does?
- Well, you don't expect things of a girl, certain things... like climbing mountains, going through floods, making the most of it.
You know what I mean?
Don't think I do.
Well, I want to say that...
I think you've been just fine, for a girl.
Oh, what I really mean is that if we get out of here alive... and when we're old enough--
- John!
- Mary!
There's the log you've needed for your raft.
That's it, just what we need.
Perfect!
Got it.
- Oh!
- Keep out of the way!
- It's a tiger!
- No, no, it's a jaguar. Felis onca.
Get that beast out of here!
It's probably as frightened of us as we are of it.
- Just a big cat, milord.
- Well, get rid of it. Get rid of it.
Can't stand cats at the best of times.
Confounded things always make me sneeze.
Go on! Get out of here!
- Go on! Get out!
- Don't, John! The poor thing.
Do not move, not an eyelash.
''Marooned in ombu tree.
Latitude, 37 degrees south.
Longitude, 66 degrees west.
Send help immediately.''
One, two... three, four, five... six, seven.
More than two kilometers away.
My father always told me, never go near a tree in a thunderstorm.
One, two, three... four, five.
I think it's getting closer.
Yes. At 35 degrees centigrade... sound travels at approximately-- one--
Great heavens, the tree's on fire. Look!
We'll beat it out.
No time for that sort of thing.
Get out of the way!
You see? It's too late now.
The oil in the ombu tree, milord, it has a remarkably low flashpoint.
- Onto the raft. It's our only chance.
- Look out!
Oh, no!
- I'll get it.
- No, don't!
Apparently, we have our choice: eaten raw down there... or roasted alive up here.
Hold on, everybody. Mother Nature comes to our rescue. A waterspout!
Ahoy!
Ahoy!
We're still several degrees off course, you know.
Hurry up with the canvas.
There's a breeze coming up.
Aye, aye, Captain!
You're strangely quiet, aren't you?
- Sorry, milord. I was thinking.
- I don't know which is worse, by George: having you so happy you sing all the time, or so glum you won't even talk.
''The ombu tree is gorgeous.
Enjoy it.'' Huh.
I am stupid!
Stupid! Stupid!
I know, but that hasn't worried you till now.
- It is better they do not hear.
- Better they don't hear?
What are you talking about?
It is something
I remembered in the night.
- How could I be so stupid?
I don't know, but the shark I caught...
- Land ho! with the bottle, it was a mako shark.
- It--
- Ahoy!
And as well as I know anything in the world, I should know that the mako shark lives only in--
Be quiet! Ahoy there!
Ahoy. Ahoy there!
I think I see it. There.
- A canoe!
- Ahoy there! Aho--
Good heavens. It's an Indian war canoe.
This is a fine fix.
We're completely unarmed.
- It's Thalcave! He did come back!
- What? Thalca--
Ho-ho. Thalcave, my good man.
Delighted to see you.
- I bring news.
- News? What kind of news?
You come in canoe.
We go fast to village... where they hold prisoners, three sailor men.
Three sailor me--
Oh, monsieur, we've found them!
It's like a miracle.
Thank you, my lordship! Thank you!
Oh, I say, I say. Careful. Come along.
Let's get aboard. Careful, now. Careful.
You're a welcome sight, sir, believe me. Is this thing safe?
Forty-six, 47, 48...
Oh, now it's come,
I can hardly believe it.
- We're saved!
- We're saved!
Stop it! Stop it! Who the devil are these people? Where's Captain Grant?
These not right men?
It's all my fault.
How could I be so stupid?
It's what I started to tell you, milord, about the mako shark.
- What about the blasted thing?
- It lives only in and around the Indian Ocean.
That's what the-the word ''Indian'' means in the note... not that they were captured by Indians.
If you knew this, why didn't you tell me before I paid out all that money?
I kept hoping, milord, that maybe somehow I could be wrong.
This can mean only one thing:
Captain Grant is in Australia.
Australia? That's where
I wanted to go in the first place... only I was stupid enough to let you talk me out of it.
Oh, my dear children, I'm so sorry it all had to end like this.
Listen! Thalcave speak.
For many years, my people hunt... trail game many miles.
Sometimes sneak up, but game not there.
But Indian knows if game not there... it somewhere else.
Keep looking: otherwise,
Indian die out many years ago.
''Keep looking.''
He's right, you know.
Now we know where Captain Grant really is.
And by Jove, we'll go and find him.
Oh, thank you, Thalcave.
Thank you.
- How does she look to you?
- Just what we need.
- Ain't a ship hereabouts could overhaul her.
- What about the steam?
- We can learn.
- The old man wants to know what happened to the Britannia.
- Maybe I should tell him.
- You're not serious, now, are ya?
Maybe I should tell him.
The very spot, your lordship, where she sank beneath the waves.
Now, it's me own dear brother who lost his life... tryin' to put out in a small boat to save some of the crew.
- It was shockin'.
- All right, Osborne. Pay 'em off.
- Very good, milord.
- Thank you, lordship.
Much-- Much obliged.
- I don't wanna see any more.
- Very good, milord.
Look at that!
Ridiculous! Preposterous!
How can the same ship go down in a dozen different places, sometimes
500 miles apart? Answer me that.
Ah, confounded wharf rats! Lie to you, take your money, cut your throat if you give 'em half a chance.
How the dickens can I tell where to start, eh? What do you want?
- Mr. Frederick Ayrton to see you, milord.
- I told you I didn't want to see anybody else.
- This is a gentleman, your lordship.
- I do hope I haven't arrived at an awkward moment.
I'm sorry I couldn't get here sooner.
I would've warned you not to offer a reward.
- Well, as a matter of--
- I'm afraid you'll find very little integrity... among some of the men who frequent our waterfront.
And it so happens that
I have the very information you require.
- About my father?
- Ah, so this is the daughter of Captain Grant.
Well, if I can reunite this delightful child and her gallant father... that is the reward I'm interested in.
Were you ever in Plymouth?
Plymouth, England?
No, I haven't had that pleasure.
May I inquire, sir, as to the nature of your information?
Oh, well, two years ago,
I was caught in a violent storm in the Tasman Sea.
We picked up a poor fellow, badly battered and halfdrowned...
- just off the coast of New Zealand.
- New Zealand?
He said he was from the Britannia and that she'd gone down with all hands.
He died during the night, and our ship combed the area the following day.
You know, until I read that piece in the paper about the message... in the bottle, I had no idea that there were any survivors.
But why wasn't the sinking reported when you reached your destination?
Well, I assumed that it was. I was only a passenger on the ship, you know.
Heavens. If he landed in New Zealand, he must've been captured by the Maoris.
I'll report this to the authorities at once. Osborne!
- I'm afraid it isn't as easy as that.
- Why ever not?
You haven't had my experience in dealing with our colonial government.
Eventually, you learn to get along in spite of them.
They talk endlessly, and they need authorization from London.
You'll be lucky if they're ready in a year.
But anything could happen to him in a year. What do you suggest?
Oh, I-I can't afford to get mixed up in this.
I've told you all that I know, and-- and I've got my own estates to run.
Sir, the lives of three men are at stake.
I'd like to speak to this gentleman alone, please.
The trouble is,
New Zealand is not in the Indian Ocean.
There is something strange, very strange.
I don't care what it is.
I've seen that man before.
- Oh, you're just imagining it.
- No, I'm not.
Anyway, I can't stand people who look at me like that.
''Delightful child.''
''Gallant father.''
Perhaps it's a good sign that neither of you take to him... because it seems that everything else that you've welcomed with open arms... has turned out dead wrong.
Please understand I don't wish to do anything against the law.
-Oh, certainly not.
-But at the same time, I don't intend... to leave Captain Grant in the hands of those bloodthirsty cannibals.
So, uh, I appeal to you as a man with experience... and knowledge of local conditions to help us before it's too late.
All right. I'll gather up some men who know the Maoris... and who can handle any kind of situation.
By Jove, you mean we just, uh, go in and have it out with them?
Oh, good heavens, no. We'll take along some supplies to barter... and then if Captain Grant and his men are still alive, we'll buy them back.
Capital idea. I can't tell you how grateful I am to you.
- I need hardly remind you that we must be discreet about what we plan to do.
- Ooh, of course, of course.
- Don't want to be tied down by a lot of confounded red tape, do we?
- No.
Just my son John and Captain Mangles.
Otherwise, not a word to a soul.
Yes, just as it should be.
Get this crate down in the hull, would ya, lads?
Motley looking lot of fellows you've got together.
Well, when you look for men to go into Maori country... you don't choose them from among the socially elite.
Jolly well put.
But I must say, I didn't realize you'd require quite so much merchandise.
Ooh, I'm afraid the days are gone when one could impress the natives with a handful of colored beads.
And if they choose to sell their prisoners dearly... we'd better be prepared.
I see.
John, you've got to tell me.
What's going on out there?
Ah, mademoiselle, you are far too beautiful... in the new gown to worry your pretty little head about such things.
But what's in all those boxes?
I would've thought if my father wanted you to know, he would've told you.
Every man out there looks like a fugitive from the penal colony.
John, you've got to do something. Don't let this man make a fool of your father.
Just because he called you ''a delightful child'' and you don't like it... you think he's trying to make a fool of my father.
It is better that we think it, monsieur, than to give him the opportunity to prove it.
All right. Let me tell you something, both of you.
Maybe my father huffs and puffs a little bit, and we've all smiled at him just in fun.
But I don't think anybody's going to make a fool of him quite as easily as-- well, certain people I could name.
And now, if you'll excuse me.
Patience, dear.
We shall see what we shall see.
I'll wager she's faster than any ship in the Royal Navy.
Good. You know,
I'd say that... steam was the coming thing if it weren't all so complicated to handle.
Well, you don't have to complicate it.
Actually, it's quite simple.
- Yes?
- Pardon, milord. Uh-Uh, Could I talk... to you sometime before too long?
- Certainly. What about?
- No matter how much I think about it, it is always the same.
Captain Grant is in Australia.
There is no possible way the note could mean he's in New Zealand.
Oh, my dear fellow, don't worry about that beastly note.
Mr. Ayrton knows precisely where the Britannia went down, don't you?
- Of course.
- Milord, I'd be the happiest man... in the world if it turns out that once again, I'm wrong.
- I've no doubt you will be.
- If it's not too much trouble,
I'd like to see the engine room.
Oh, my dear fellow, delighted.
Take you around myself.
I think you'll find there's nothing complicated about steam.
It's a beautiful day. Why not enjoy it, let bygones be bygones?
Now that we're at sea, I can let you in on our secret, if you're interested.
Those boxes you were wondering about.
Would you like to know what's in them?
Trinkets. Trade goods.
They're for barter with the Maoris so that we can buy your father's freedom.
- Who told you this?
- Mr. Ayrton.
- And you believed him?
- All right, Miss Suspicious.
If it'll make you more companionable,
I'll take you below and show you.
Well, here you are.
All right, Pandora.
Which box do you want me to open?
- That one.
- You sure you don't have a guilty feeling?
After all, it is rather like spying on someone... especially when they've gone out of their way to be so nice to you.
- Open it.
- I will.
Nothing is too much trouble if it satisfies your curiosity.
Voilà, mademoiselle.
''Trade goods. Trinkets,'' he said.
So that's his game. He's using my father's ship as a gunrunner.
Pity you did that.
Wilcox, down here!
We've got to warn the others. I'll lead them off, then you make for the door.
- There he is!
- I see him!
- Ooh! Oh!
- Now, is that a nice way to behave... when we're taking you to meet your father?
Come on.
Make no noise. Just stop the paddles.
Anything else, and I'll shoot.
Ever been to New Zealand before?
Yes. Twice.
Do as I tell you, and perhaps you'll live to make it three times.
- We're stopping.
- That is most strange.
- Raise the hands quietly.
- Do as he says, Robert.
Help! Pirates!
Lord Glenarvan, help!
Come quickly!
Lord Glenarvan, help! Pirates!
Lord Glenarvan!
I thought
I heard the boy call for help.
You did. Now, give me that gun, and no harm will come to him.
Wait.
I say, you can't put us out there without oars. It's not human.
Oh, the current will carry you to the shore, if that's any consolation... but I'm afraid we'll have to keep your crew on board... until they've taught us the fine points of using steam.
We're unaccustomed to such luxuries in the South Pacific.
- You'll pay for this.
- You've got it backwards, old man.
We have been paid for it, and quite handsomely. Cheer up, Frenchie.
You promised you would be the happiest man in the world... if you were wrong about Captain Grant being in Australia.
And you were. Brown and Riley, lay aloft and stand by to make sail.
- Aye, aye, sir.
- You were in Plymouth!
My father signed you on the day he sailed.
As third mate. What a memory.
You'll hang for this, you know.
I'll see to it personally.
I'll make a full report to the admiralty.
You do that.
And here's a bottle to put it in.
Let's hope it isn't swallowed by a shark. Lower away!
You'll never get away with this.
That's what Captain Grant said when we put him over the side... at this very spot with his two rather foolishly loyal mates.
If you're lucky, you might all end up in the same stewpot.
If anyone is interested,
I might explain.
It is the influence of the west wind drift... playing against the east Australian current... that might drive us right up onto the shore.
Yes, yes, yes.
That's the second of my ships he's got.
First the Britannia, and now my beautiful new steam yacht.
It's all clear now.
It was a mutiny.
There's no reason why he should lie about it.
My father was set adrift here--
Then he must be a prisoner of the Maoris.
What did he mean, we might all end up in the same stewpot?
Not to change the subject, but our reception committee seems to be waiting.
Maoris, hundreds of'em.
Deuce of a fix.
No trinkets to bargain with.
What have we got to offer, huh?
Just us, I suppose.
- Good gracious!
- You come as a stranger, and I take ye in.
I have prepared a place for thee in the presence of thine enemy.
- It's all right, my dear.
I'm sure he's harmless.
- What think ye now?
I be crazy, eh?
Not a bit of it.
I be smart. Mark ye well the words of old Bill Gaye.
Bill Gaye! Weren't you the mate on my father's ship?
Depends entirely who your father was.
What was his ship?
And who you be, for that matter?
You see, I be smart.
Makes a difference who she is.
I'm Mary Grant. My father's
Captain Grant of the Britannia.
Well, why didn't you say so before?
Fine ship, she was.
I walked her decks across the seven seas.
Woe be onto thee, O Moab, for thy sons are taken captive.
- Who is he?
- Fantastic, he seems to be the mate from the Britannia.
Do you know where he is?
Can you tell me?
Where is Captain Grant?
Have you no eyes?
Can you not see?
- He's gone.
- Where?
Same as before. Diane's Inlet.
- Did the Maoris take him?
- He be smart too.
He learns the way to keep alive, for they need him when they get more guns.
Guns? Then it must be Ayrton.
Aye, that's who it be.
Somehow the devil has got another ship.
- Were there three of you?
- Aye, three of us there were.
Captain Grant, McNabb and old Bill Gaye... against Ayrton and all of his mutinous crew.
- The scoundrel!
- Bonjour, monsieur.
My father, Captain Grant-- Did he and
McNabb go together to Diane's Inlet?
Nay, my child.
I say unto you:
McNabb, he was not smart.
He was caught when he tried to escape.
Odd devil.
- What's he laughing at?
- For this child, I have prayed.
And the Lord hath granted my petition, which I asked of him.
This is the night the Lord hath given us our salvation.
What think ye? Could a man force himself through there... even a man who has gone without food to make himself as thin as a man can be?
Nay. I say unto you, it is impossible.
It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle.
Robert, do you think you could crawl through there?
Maybe if I tried very hard.
- You be smart too.
- Even if he could, what good would it do?
I'll show ye now. The Lord helps them that helps themselves.
Two years we took to make it, from the hairs of our heads... from the garments we wore, from a thousand things we gathered.
Absolutely preposterous. What could the boy possibly do all by himself?
There be more to it than that, for this be the night of the haka.
Bide ye your time till the night be well begun... and the horns sound and the flames leap upward... and the devil hath seized the souls of our captors.
Then I will show the way.
- Nobody's looking. Now's your chance.
- Right. Up you go. Up.
- It looks awfully small.
- Go on. Go on!
I'm stuck.
Let out all the air.
Upon my soul, I don't know which is worse: a crazy man... who thinks he's smart or a Frenchman who admits he's stupid.
- Hold that.
- Oh! Ooh-ooh!
Now to get the pendulum swinging.
Oh, do be careful!
Lower away.
I have the unhappy feeling we're going out of the frying pan into the fire.
He can't get over!
The rope's not long enough!
Lower away!
- He still can't do it.
- Go on! Lower away!
That's all there is!
Then let her go!
He did it!
Tie that down there.
Go down it.
Go. Bye.
- Deuce of a fix this is.
- Off ye go to the mountain.
We'll never outrun these fellas.
By Jove, I never saw a rope burn like that.
Gunpowder. It's woven in like a fuse.
Aye, what say ye?
Who be smart now?
''Vengeance is mine.
I will repay,'' said the Lord.
Father, come on!
If this is the sacred volcano of the taboo, they dare not follow.
You know of such things, even though you be a stranger?
Aye. I be smart too.
Aye. We be two of a kind.
- By Jove, they've stopped.
- What think ye now of old Bill Gaye?
Be he crazy or be he smart?
They dare not set foot here, for all this is taboo.
I say, that's splendid, isn't it?
- But they're moving on again!
- A slight miscalculation, milord.
- I'm afraid we're on the wrong volcano.
- Just as I thought.
- Out of the frying pan, into the fire.
- Don't worry, milord.
Some help, please!
- What are you planning to do?
- Uncork the bottle and let the genie free.
Oh, I've got it!
Everybody, push!
- Lucky shot, that. Chance in a million.
- At the university, milord...
I'm considered the wizard of the croquet court.
Come ye, where we'll be safe.
- Oh, it's horrible!
- Have no fear, mademoiselle.
The Maoris can run faster than the lava. Enjoy it!
And now, Mr. Gaye, to Captain Grant.
Aye, to Captain Grant!
Follow Bill Gaye!
He's got it all planned out!
All right, Grant.
Tell them there are six more boxes... nearly 200 rifles still in the hold.
I'll set the whole lot ashore as soon as they hand over the money.
And how do I know the rest are as good as this one?
- I give you my word.
- That's what you offered last time... when you unloaded a pile of junk.
Now, really, Grant.
Every time I do something charitable,
I live to regret it.
Like putting you ashore alive.
And I intend to stay alive by not recommending rifles I haven't examined.
My beautiful, beautiful yacht.
If they've done anything to damage her...
I'll have them strung up by their thumbs.
How did you know where she was going to be?
This be where they always unload: in Diane's Inlet.
In Diane's Inlet? Oh!
In the note, what I thought said
''Indian'' was really--
Oh!
I'm stupid, stupid, stupid!
Cheer up, my friend. Your stupidity may turn out to be of divine inspiration.
Mr. Gaye, I thought we were going to find Father.
We be. We be. Look ye now.
It's Father!
He looks well, thank goodness.
- They're all getting into boats.
- They're comin' here.
We have but little time to prepare our reception.
- I come to see thy ship.
- No one can come aboard.
Surely ye be not afraid of old Bill Gaye?
- Bill Gaye?
- ''The hoary head is a crown of glory.''
Know ye not that?
- How many do you want, Lucky?
- That'll do.
How many cards do you want?
- So where's mine?
- I gave you them.
What a hand here. Right.
How do we get past him?
Excuse me, sir, but is this Lord Glenarvan's yacht?
Well, sonny, I guess--
Here. Wait a minute. Ain't you the boy that's with that lot? Come back here!
- Your lordship.
- We haven't got the keys, Captain.
We'll have to break the door down best we can.
- Put out your decks, gentlemen.
- I'm busted.
- See if Thompson'll play.
He's got money.
- Yeah. All right.
- Your deal, Bob.
- Right. Here you are.
Riley, come here quick!
- The brig!
- The brig!
Know ye not what the Good Book says? ''He that diggeth a pit shall fall into it''?
Send him over to me.
Ooh, got him! Quick.
I suppose we'll have to open every box.
Put the best ones on top.
Ayrton, you scoundrel!
Don't move. You may live long enough to hang.
Hello, Glenarvan.
Welcome aboard.
Well, here we are.
This makes us even, doesn't it, uh?
You've got your ship back, and I'm bringing you Captain Grant... so, uh, why don't we, uh--
Captain, take him below with the rest of the scoundrels.
Aye, ye've sown the wind... and I say to you, you shall reap the whirlwind.
Back, you dogs! Back, I say!
Bill Gaye! What on earth--
- Father!
- Mary. Robert!
You think I be crazy, don't ye?
See now, how are the mighty fallen.
- How on earth did you find me out here?
- Monsieur Paganel.
- He's a French professor.
- He found a note in a bottle.
- Lord Glenarvan took us on his yacht.
- And we've been all around the world looking for you.
- South America.
- And we were captured by Maoris.
- Maoris!
My dear children.
Oh, how I've prayed for this day.
- I was beginning to give up hope that I'd ever see you again.
- I must be catching a cold.
And now you're suddenly here, and I'm able to hold you both close in my arms.
I can't find words to express my gratitude to all of you.
We would've been here months earlier if
I hadn't been so stupid about the note.
- The note?
- Yes. The-The note in-in the bottle.
The note in the bottle?
What think ye now? It was I put that note in the bottle.
And put the bottle in the sea.
''Cast thy bread on the waters... for thou shall find it after many days.''
But they seemed so sure it was their father's handwriting.
- It was, wasn't it?
- Now you know my secret... why I ran away to sea.
The voice is the voice of a God-fearing man... but the hands are the hands of a forger.
- Oh, my word!
- Bill, you scoundrel!
Just think. If he hadn't put the note in the bottle... and if Monsieur Paganel hadn't caught that shark--
And if you hadn't tried to slap my face that morning on the way to Plymouth...
I wouldn't have talked my father into making this trip.
- Funny how things work out, isn't it?
- Isn't it?
Here we are, all of us together.
All of us.
Did you ever see so many stars?
Once, on top of a mountain.
Did you know that down there, out of the light, you can see the Southern Cross?
Southern Cross?
So, that's my little girl.
By George, they do grow up.
Uh-Uh, I was just thinking to myself.
No matter where you are in the world... it is always different, but it is always the same.
In English, you would say...
''All climates are the same for love.''
There it is.
The Southern Cross.

Dr. Grant, Dr. Pierce...
- ... can you hear me?
- Loud and clear.
Paul. Greg. Brad.
Now this is a tough assignment.
But if this mission is successful, you will be the first men to land on Mars.
This project has been the most costly yet devised by man.
However, the safety of the crew and passengers still takes top priority.
Now is that clearly understood?
Captain Paul Travers?
Yes, sir.
- Space Captain Greg Martin?
- Yes, sir.
- Space Navigator Brad Newman?
- Yes, sir.
- Dr. Grant?
- Yes, sir.
- Dr. Pierce?
- Yes, sir.
OK. Away you go, and good luck.
Thank you, sir.
All right, this is it.

Air-sea rescue is on its way. 
Flight deck to escape unit. Ready, Greg?
- OK, Paul. All in position.
- OK, Greg. 
Coming back now.
Stand by.
Here we go!
(chatter)
- Gentlemen.
- (men fall silent)
You've now had time to study the fine report...
...that has been produced by our aviation investigators.
We at the Martian Exploration Center thank those concerned...
...for their untiring efforts in this direction.
Although the report runs to 862 pages and meticulously describes...
...every happening that led up to the crash 24 months ago...
...the conclusion is all too simple: Sabotage.
Now, before we progress, I would ask you for a vote of confidence...
...in the findings of this very fine report.
Thank you, gentlemen, for your unanimous support.
24 months have now elapsed since the tragic crash of the Zero X.
In eight weeks, Earth will again be in a suitable position in relation to Mars...
...to make the second attempt.
Can I take it that I have your approval for this, too?
I think our security arrangements are inadequate...
...and suggest we ask International Rescue to be present at the next launching.
Are you suggesting we are incapable of handling our own security arrangements?
I have 862 pages here, sir, which say just that.
(uproar)
Well, Father?
Takeoff is scheduled for tomorrow.
- You'll have to make a decision soon.
- Even if it's no!
This is a tough one. I know how you boys feel. I guess you're rarin' to go.
But as you know, we have a strict rule here:
...no International Rescue craft is launched unless someone is in grave danger.
- Right?
- Right.
- Guess so, Dad.
- That's the way it's always been.
- Guess you're right, Dad.
- Yeah.
However... rules were made to be broken.
Now, this is what we do.
- Scott.
- Yes, sir?
Launch Thunderbird 1, go to Glenn Field and stand by...
...for the takeoff of Zero X.
- Yes, sir!
Virgil, launch Thunderbird 2 and follow Scott to Glenn Field.
When Zero X takes off, escort it on the first part of its journey.
- Yes, sir.
- Father, can I...?
Yes. Launch Thunderbird 3 and orbit the Earth...
...until Zero X has established its course to Mars.
- Gee! Thanks, Dad.
- What about me, Father?
It's unlikely that you'll be needed, but be ready, in case.
- Yes, sir.
- OK, boys.
Thunderbirds are go!
Thunderbird 1... ready to go.
OK, Scott, clear to go. Good luck.
Thanks, Father.
Well, you made your decision, Mr. Tracy.
Yes. I only hope it was the right one.
Now that the boys are going to be at the launching of Zero X...
...the safety of the crew is assured, but...
But what about the saboteurs?
Do you think they will strike again?
Say... what's the time, Tin Tin?
The time? Uh... just about eleven o'clock, Mr. Tracy.
That makes it about 4pm in England - tea time.
I don't understand, Mr. Tracy.
Well, those saboteurs you were talking about. If they do strike again...
...I know just the person to take care of them.
Will that be all, m'lady?
Thank you, Parker. That will be all.
Very good, m'lady.
(bleeping)
International Rescue, England.
Lady Penelope speaking.
(Mr. Tracy) Hi, Penny. 
Well, I've made my decision. 
We're gonna oversee the Zero X launch. 
Thunderbirds 1, 2 and 3 are on their way.
Go to the States immediately and ensure that there's no sabotage attempt this time.
FAB, Jeff. I'll fly over with FAB 1 right away.
Now, I'll need to move around there freely on this type of assignment.
Can you pull a few strings to see that I get the necessary passes?
Will do, Penny. There's a big press conference tomorrow evening.
- You'll represent a British magazine.
- FAB, Jeff. 
You rang, m'lady?
Yes, Parker. Get out the Rolls-Royce.
I'll call the airport - we're taking off for America with FAB 1 immediately.
Thunderbird 2 from Mobile Control.
You are clear to land.
Mobile Control from Thunderbird 2. FAB.
Well... I guess we're all set.
By morning, Thunderbird 3 will be in position to observe the launch path...
...and we've got all our gear here.
- Thanks.
I guess that's all we can do for the moment.
See you at the press conference tonight.
No, thanks. As far as we're concerned, the only good publicity is no publicity.
And in conclusion, as I always say, the only bad publicity is no publicity.
So have a good conference, but please be brief.
Our astronauts can only spare you half an hour...
...as they have a very busy schedule ahead of them tomorrow.
- Captain Travers?
- Yes, ma'am?
I'm Lady Penelope Creighton-Ward, representing The Universal Mirror. 
First question: Tell me, what do you find most frightening?
The ordeal of this press conference or your flight tomorrow in Zero X?
(chuckles) Without question, this press conference, ma'am.
Thank you, Captain Travers.
Now, I'm sending a messenger over with a small St Christopher...
...specially struck for the occasion by The Universal Mirror. 
I would like to tell my readers that you'll be wearing it during the flight.
- It'll be a pleasure, Lady Penelope.
- That's very kind of you.
Well, it looks as if my time is up.
Best of luck for tomorrow.
- (line buzzes)
- Captain Paul Travers.
Package from Lady Penelope,
Universal Mirror, sir.
Right.
There'll be three crew and two scientists. Right...
Right again.
Yep, at 1400 hours tomorrow.
That's right. Six weeks and two days.
I'm afraid I can't answer that question.
I'm afraid you'll have to refer that question to the PRO.
Why, sure. We'll do anything to help the press.
I've got a feeling that the takeoff tomorrow is gonna be just fine.
60 minutes to liftoff.
Commence Zero X pre-flight assembly.
Thunderbird 2 from Mobile Control.
- Are you ready, Virgil?
- Standing by, Scott.
Mobile Control calling Thunderbird 3.
OK, Scott, in orbit.
I should see Zero X as it leaves the Earth's atmosphere.
- Unless liftoff time is altered. 
- FAB, Alan.
Now, m'lady?
Now, Parker.
(bleeping)
(long bleep)
Channel 1, m'lady.
(bleeping)
Good. That's all right.
(bleeping)
(long bleep)
Channel 2, m'lady.
Clear launch apron. 
Zero X moving into position. 
(bleeping)
Channel 5, m'lady.
Thank you, Parker.
- Trouble, Parker.
- I thought it was too good to be true.
Lady Penelope calling Scott at Mobile Control.
- What's the trouble, Lady Penelope?
- Number 5 negative.
OK. Penelope, here's what we do. 
The countdown must continue... 
... or we miss the rendezvous
with Thunderbird 3 in space. 
I'll attend to number 5.
Meanwhile, locate Dr. Grant. 
FAB.
This is Assembly Control. 
Radio-controlled lifting body 2
about to take up its position. 
Everybody OK?
Yeah. Yeah... fine.
Everything's just fine.
And how about you, Dr. Grant?
Are you OK?
Keep quite still, Doctor.
There's something wrong with your...
...face!
- (Dr. Pierce) He's got a gun!
Allow yourself ten seconds before coming through this door after me.
Otherwise, you might get your head blown off.
I think I've located number 5, m'lady.
That's him, Parker.
Well done. Number 5 was a phony,
but he's got away. Take care of him. 
Right, Scott. Leave it to me.
But before I go, you'll find the real Dr. Grant on a bearing of 1 7 4...
...and a range of 1,204 yards from my present position.
FAB.
I can see the gentleman in question ahead, m'lady.
He's just leaving the control tower in a motor car.
Right, Parker... away we go.
(car horn)
(horn blares)
Now, you'll find the real Dr. Grant somewhere in this building here.
Right.
Airport police. This is Assembly Control.
Search the missile store, block F, immediately...
...and locate Dr. Grant's whereabouts.
Providing he's OK, bring him over to Central Control immediately.
Roger, Control. 
- Say, how do you know all this?
- A pretty little bird told me.
- He's got a good start on us, m'lady.
- Yes, I can see him down below.
My guess is he's making for that motorboat by the jetty.
- How're you feeling, Dr. Grant?
- Just fine.
He just held me at gunpoint, tied me up, and locked me in the missile store.
Guess it's another sabotage attempt.
What beats me is how you knew where I was.
All you need to know is that the launch is taking place as per schedule.
OK, sir.
So much for the good-luck charm given to me by Lady Penelope.
- Safety belts on, m'lady?
- Safety belts on, Parker.
Lowering hydrofoils now, m'lady.
I don't believe it.
I don't believe it!
Takeoff lighting.
It looks as if an accomplice is waiting to pick him up in that helicopter, m'lady.
It's an army 'elicopter, m'lady, and no doubt it's 'eavily armed.
Well, let's hope they attack, Parker.
Then we may have an opportunity to shoot it down.
Mobile Control to Thunderbird 2.
Launching underway.
- You'd better lift off yourself.
- Thunderbird 2. FAB.
- Stand by to take evasive action, Parker.
- Yes, m'lady.
Now, m'lady?
Now, Parker.
Just a little bit over to the right, old son.
Thank you very much.
I don't think there's much point in looking for survivors, Parker.
No, m'lady.
(planes approaching)
Look, m'lady!
- Look!
- What a magnificent sight!

International Rescue calling Zero X.
Congratulations on a superb liftoff.
Our services were not required... 
... although a sabotage attempt
was made just before liftoff. 
But we took care of it.
The rest is up to you.
International Rescue from Zero X.
Dr. Grant has just told us about it.
The only thing we really want to say is thanks.
And may I add my thanks and congratulations, too.
You did pretty well yourself.
Mobile Control from FAB 1. Are we clear?
Hi, there, Penelope. All clear. 
I'm on my own. Well, how'd it go?
- FAB.
- Well done, Penelope. 
Well, it's been a hectic time for all of us.
How about us all getting together tonight over a drink?
I hear there's a fab nightclub called the Swinging Star near my hotel.
FAB.
Hi there, Penelope. I just happened to be
monitoring your frequency and I, uh... 
Well? What do you say, Virgil?
Are you game?
I sure am!
You're going where?
Ah, the, uh... to the Swinging Star, Father.
It's some kind of nightclub.
That means you won't be back till morning.
(humming)
Sure, I understand - you need a break.
But this is a tough job we're doing here.
Mr. Tracy, all work and no play makes Scott a dull boy.
Hm... OK then, Scott. Have a good time.
Gee thanks, Dad. Glenn Field will be able to reach us by radio at any time.
Don't forget, Dad, we'll be at the Swinging Star.
Right, Scott.
- The Swinging Star?
- Yeah, it's some sort of a nightclub.
- They're all going out to celebrate.
- A nightclub?
And I'm stuck back here at base. Just my luck!
Say, Tin Tin... why don't we go off to the mainland tonight - just the two of us?
That would be lovely, Alan.
I'll wear my new dress.
What goes on around here?
Have you all gone crazy?
This is International Rescue, remember?
We can't leave the base unmanned.
- Sorry, Tin Tin.
- That's all right, Mr. Tracy. I understand.
Well, I don't!
- I'm going to bed.
- But won't you have some coffee?
No, thanks. It keeps me awake.
(moaning)
(Scott) We're all going
to the Swinging Star. 
(Mr. Tracy) No, Alan. 
Have you gone crazy?
We can't leave the base half-manned. 
Penelope, you're 30 seconds late.
The Swinging Star... Sounds great!
- (car horn peeps)
- Why, here she is!
Why, hello there, Penny.
- Have I kept you waiting?
- Of course not. You're dead on time.
Where to, m'lady?
Why... the Swinging Star, of course.
- Now, m'lady?
- Now, Parker.
Why, we're flying!
That's right.
Turn right just past planet Mars...
...and you should see the Swinging Star straight ahead of you, Parker.
Right, m'lady.
There it is, m'lady. Straight ahead.
- Gee! It's fabulous!
- I thought you'd like it.
No parking problem here, m'lady.
(# electric guitar instrumental)
Wow! What a terrific group.
Yes. They always play at the Swinging Star.
You see, they're way-out. 
Say, Penelope... how... how did you enjoy your night here with Scott and Virgil?
Oh, we didn't come to this Swinging Star.
- Oh, really?
- No. This is reserved especially for you.
Oh... uh...
Gee! Have some more champagne.
(snoring)
(compere) Now, ladies and gentlemen, we present the biggest star in the universe:
...none other than Cliff Richard Junior!

# But then I think I should let you know
# That I got friends
# So, baby, listen to me
# A shooting star will shoot you
# And Mars will go to war
# The man in the moon will jump on you
# If you don't love me no more
# I saw you in someone else's car
# You told me that he won't go too far
# That may be so
# But you let him know
# That I got friends
# So, baby, listen to me
# A shooting star will shoot you
# And Mars will go to war
# The man in the moon will jump on you
# If you don't love me no more
# You tell me that I'm the man for you
# But you do things you should never do
# So now, hear this warning once again
# Yes, I got friends
# So, baby, listen to me
# A shooting star will shoot you
# And Mars will go to war
# The man in the moon will jump on you
# If you don't love me no more
# If you don't stop making me lose face
# I will have you put up there in space
# So just do what I'm a-telling you
# Cos I got friends
# Baby, listen to me
# A shooting star will shoot you
# And Mars will go to war
# The man in the moon will jump on you
# If you don't love me no more
- What an evening!
- It isn't over yet, Alan. The night is young.
- Come on, let's dance.
- Yeah, let's dance.
(bleeping)
Alan Tracy, International Rescue.
Oh, Alan, sorry to disturb you,
but this is an emergency. 
Look, Father, can't Scott and Virgil handle this? I'm kind of tied up right now.
I'm afraid Scott and Virgil are away
enjoying themselves, as usual. 
You are the only one I can rely on, Alan. 
I quite understand, Dad.
I'll be down right away.
FAB.
- Penelope, we've got to go.
- Oh, Alan! Must we?
Penelope, I'm afraid we must. Duty calls.
But is there no way you can get out of this?
Look, Penelope, Dad needs me.
He's depending on me.
I've just got to go.
Mind the gap, m'lady, when you step into the car.
Thank you, Parker. We don't want to fall back to Earth, do we?
Mind the gap, Alan.
Mind the gap, Alan.
Mind the gap, Alan.
I can't possibly make it!
What's the matter, Alan?
What's the matter, Alan?
Don't tell me - you're afraid.
- I'm not afraid.
- A brave astronaut like you, afraid?
I am not afraid!
(Penelope's laughter echoes)
(thud)
Alan?
Alan, are you OK?
Alan! Alan, where are you?
Gee!
Sorry, Dad.
I... I guess I fell out of bed.
I've had a word with Brains. He says this modification is possible. Right, Brains?
- Check.
- What the heck are you talking about?
Oh, come on, you two!
The water's lovely and warm.
Thunderbird 4 at your service.
Catch!
Can't a guy get any peace around here?
Wish John was here to enjoy the fun.
But someone's got to man the space satellite.
(Paul) Zero X to Earth. We have just
touched down successfully on Mars. 
All systems are go. Will radio a full report
to you in 30 minutes' ground elapse time. 
(bleeping)
Go ahead, John.
Father, I was just listening to
the Zero X transmission to Earth. 
They've safely landed on Mars. Thought
you'd all be interested to hear the news. 
Thanks, John. Keep in touch.
FAB.
Listen, everyone! Just heard from John.
After six weeks in space,
Zero X has safely landed on Mars.
- Well, Dr. Grant? What do you think?
- We need to get as many samples...
...back to Earth as possible, so we can look into the possibility of life on Mars.
Sure, but what's your initial reaction?
The atmosphere would be breathable, but too thin to sustain life as we know it.
The early Martian photographs are going to prove right:
...there's no water up here.
- You can tell this from your instruments?
80 per cent instruments,
20 per cent intuition.
I agree with all Dr. Grant has just said.
But I've always been fascinated by that phrase "Life as we know it".
I have a feeling that we may encounter life as we don't know it.
These strange formations seem to be all over the planet's surface.
Don't ask me why... but they worry me.
Ray, don't let your imagination run riot.
Yeah, Tony, I know it would be all too easy to happen up here...
...but can you account for the strange rock formations?
A considerable study will have to be made before we know the answer.
But, um, my first impression is that...
...when the crust of the planet was very thin, it was struck by meteorites.
As they punctured the shell, so the hot rock exuded onto the planet's surface...
...like toothpaste out of a tube.
- A good theory, Tony.
Now explain to me how the exuding rock wrapped itself into a coil.
Ray, you've got a point.
This is one of the many things we have to investigate.
We're behind schedule. Can we move on?
Sure. Sorry.
Ray, I don't like the look of these peculiar formations either...
...though I'm sure they're just rock.
There's no sign of movement.
We'd better take a sample back to Earth.
I must say, I think that would be a wise precaution, Tony.
Can you break one up for us, Paul?
I'll go out and collect some pieces.
Sure.
OK, Paul, not too big a charge now -
I want to get a sizeable piece.
OK, Ray.
- And, Paul.
- Yeah?
As soon as you fire, I recommend you stand by at the ready.
Stand by at the ready? What for?
I don't really know.
I've just got a feeling, that's all.
Right... I'll go and get my gear.
- Greg, get the airlock ready.
- OK, sir.
Dr. Pierce! Come back in here, quickly!
Zero X from MEV. We're under attack from a form of life we do not understand.
Require immediate rendezvous with main body.
I'm just coming round on third orbit.
Will be in position in four minutes.
We'll take evasive action until you're in position.
- Give us liftoff clearance when it's OK.
- Will do. 
But we must lift off immediately. We don't know what damage they can do to us.
Doctor, we can't lift off until the main ship's in the correct rendezvous position.
Otherwise, we'll be stranded in space.
Greg, there's a whole line of them ahead.
We'd better return their fire. We can't take too much of this punishment.
OK, skipper. So far, all systems are go.
Zero X from MEV.
How are we doing, Brad?
Approaching orbital position.
Starting countdown.
Rendezvous liftoff: Minus 100...
- ... 34... 33... 32... 
- Skip the countdown. We're lifting off.
- Paul, you may not have enough fuel!
- We've no choice. We're coming up.
Greg, lift off.
- Leaving atmosphere.
- Right.
MEV from Zero X. I have you on screen.
You're approaching Zero X orbital path.
Five seconds to retro firing.
Four... three...
... two... one. Retros!
Thanks, Brad.
Guess we'll make it OK now.
All systems here appear to be at green.
OK, Paul, stay where you are - conserve your fuel. I'm coming up right behind you.
At least the Martian excursion vehicle has joined up with the main body of Zero X.
These, uh, so-called rock snakes,
Father - what do you make of them?
Well, clearly, there's life on Mars.
But I guess it's not life as we know it.
You, uh... you think they'll get back OK?
According to the reports John monitored in the space station...
...the damage to the MEV has not impaired their efficiency.
As a matter of fact, I, um...
...I had a word with the controller at Glenn Field this morning.
He said their re-entry into Earth's atmosphere will be straightforward.
They've done it a hundred times before on test flights.
What's the scheduled date for the re-entry, Dad?
Well, their flight takes them six weeks...
...so they should be arriving on the morning of September 2.
Dr. Grant, Dr. Pierce, are you ready for re-entry?
- OK, Greg, we're ready.
- Roger. 
OK, skipper, all set.
Central Control, this is Zero X.
Computer reports fire retros 30 seconds.
Ground stations, verify countdown.
You have our green light. Five seconds...
...four... three...
...two... one. Retros.
(female operator) Central Control
from Goldstone. Retro firing A-OK.
Zero X re-entry attitude correct. 
(male operator) Woomera to Central
Control. Verifying Goldstone's report. 
Zero X from Central Control.
You are in correct re-entry attitude and
are about to enter Earth's atmosphere. 
Roger, Central Control.
Retros.
Zero X from Central Control.
Lifting bodies now at 50,000 feet.
Radio control over to you in five seconds...
... four... three... 
... two... one. 
Over. 
OK, Paul, we've got the lifting bodies under our own radio control now.
Rendezvous with lifting bodies at 120,000 feet: 20 seconds.
Reduce speed to Mach 2.
Rendezvous about to take place.
Right, hold her steady, skipper.
I'm bringing in lift body 2.
Roger.
Keep her steady, skipper.
(flat beep)
Radio-control failure. I can't hold her!
What's happened?
Central Control, this is Zero X.
Emergency!
We have lost lift body 2 in a collision caused by a fault in our radio-control unit.
I'll send up another lift body immediately.
That won't help - the locking gear was damaged in the collision.
(Paul) Check on all systems shows
fuel systems go. All control systems go. 
Remote-control radio circuits
are dead. Escape unit is... 
Central Control from Zero X.
Escape-unit circuits are dead!
OK, John, I get the picture.
- Continue to monitor their frequency.
- FAB.
Right. Now, we've got to move fast.
Zero X is coming in on one wing.
It's impossible to get another wing attached.
She's unable to maintain height and will crash in about 30 minutes.
The most recent check shows that they have an escape-unit failure.
Unless we get the crew out before they hit the ground, they are all doomed men.
Scott, you know what to do. Take Brains with you for technical advice.
Yes, sir.
Virgil, take pod 4, with the air-to-air rescue equipment...
...and rendezvous with Zero X.
- Alan!
- Yes, sir.
I want you to board the Zero X and fix that hatch.
- Father?
- Yes, Gordon, you'll be needed too.
Yes, sir!
Tin Tin, I'll want your help.
Thunderbirds are go!
Maximum speed, Scott.
We're gonna need all the time we've got.
Mm-hm.
Zero X from Central Control. 
What is your rate of descent now,
and what is your air speed?
Rate of descent: Stabilized at 3,000 feet a minute. Air speed: Mach 1.2.
We can't slow the rate of descent -
the motors are flat out. Over. 
Zero X, roger. Stand by.
Emergency Control, this is Central Control.
Contact Washington immediately.
Zero X crash position established as Craigsville - population 4,800.
Impact time: 35 minutes.
So you'll need to move!
International Rescue, Zero X Central
Control here. This is an emergency!
This is International Rescue,
Thunderbird 1.
Anticipated your call. We're on our way.
ETA Glenn Field: Ten minutes.
Will you give Thunderbird 2 a course
to steer for a rendezvous with Zero X?
- They're on this frequency. 
- Roger.
Thunderbird 2 from Central Control.
I'm passing a steer to you.
Zero X's present position
is international fix system 2-4-0-4... 
- ... on a heading of 143 magnetic. 
- Roger, Central Control.
I've tried everything in the book, but the escape unit system is dead.
If only International Rescue had been with us this time.
Zero X, this is Central Control. 
Change to channel 4.
International Rescue are on their way. 
They require to make contact. 
- Is that understood?
- Yes, sir. Changing to channel 4.
I'll be glad when Scott's got his Mobile Control operating.
We'll need his assistance in locating the Zero X.
We must be getting pretty close by now.
I'll get my rescue gear on.
- Gordon, get up to the astrodome.
- OK, Virgil.
Zero X, this is International Rescue
Mobile Control. Can you hear me? Over. 
International Rescue, this is Zero X.
We hear you, loud and clear.
Zero X and Thunderbird 2 from Mobile Control.
Transmit ten seconds of unmodulated carrier wave on this frequency.
One at a time, please.
- Zero X.
- Zero X. Roger. 
- Thunderbird 2.
- Roger, Thunderbird 2.
Thunderbird 2 from Mobile Control.
Steer 0-0-2. Fly at 45,000 feet.
With your present air speed, you should sight Zero X in about four minutes.
Roger. Will do.
- What do you intend to do?
- We hope to put a man aboard Zero X.
If we succeed, we may be able to fix the escape unit. Excuse me.
- Zero X, this is Mobile Control.
- Mobile Control, this is Zero X.
Here are your instructions. Follow them precisely if the rescue is to succeed.
Go ahead.
There are approximately 15 minutes left before your aircraft crashes.
For the next ten minutes, lose as little height as possible.
Keep your aircraft steady. 
Watch the trim. 
In ten minutes, switch to automatic pilot
and go into the escape unit. 
And then... pray.
Till then, take further instructions from Thunderbird 2.
Mobile Control, this is Zero X.
Your instructions will be complied with.
Thanks.
- What are they gonna do?
- We may learn more from Thunderbird 2.
Scott! I can see it.
Alan, Gordon, stand by.
Zero X dead ahead.
FAB, Virgil.
Zero X, this is Thunderbird 2.
We're coming in below you.
Reduce speed to low safe cruising and lower nose landing gear.
We're gonna put a man aboard
to fix the escape unit. 
- So that's what they're going to try to do.
- It's suicide!
- Release air brakes, Greg.
- Right.
Lower nose wheel, Greg.
Thunderbird 2, this is Zero X.
Lowering nose wheel.
Are you sure you want to try this?
It sounds mighty dangerous to me.
It is mighty dangerous, and we do
want to try it. Now hold her steady. 
- Gordon, flight control over to you.
- OK, Virgil.
Left, left. One degree.
Right, right. Two degrees.
Right, Virgil.
- Stand by to hold position.
- OK, Gordon. 
Now!
Good shooting, Gordon.
Zero X, this is Thunderbird 2, air-to-air rescue compartment.
Keep it dead steady. Man coming aboard.
- (Paul) Roger, Thunderbird 2.
- OK.
How are you doing, Thunderbird 2?
Fine. Just keep steady, that's all.
Slow right down... and... stop!
- Give me a time check, Gordon.
- You've got four and one half minutes. 
Mobile Control from Alan.
OK, Brains. 
On the right of the master cylinder...
...that supplies power to the hydraulic system of the nose wheel...
...you will find a yellow wiring harness.
Follow this through to a red junction box marked "EUC".
Got it.
Doctors Grant and Pierce, hold tight.
I'm removing you to escape unit.
OK, Paul.
OK, Paul.
OK... cover removed.
Place transistorized-radio-induction unit on the side of the junction box.
- OK, Brains.
- Right, Alan. 
Now, all you have to do... 
... is remove the screws that are
anchoring the yellow and green lines... 
... and reconnect them on one block... 
...so we get a direct link, green to yellow, all the way down the bank.
OK, Brains. Time check, please.
- Two and one quarter minutes. 
- Right.
Brad, Greg, I'm sending you both back to the escape unit.
Right, sir. Switching to automatic pilot.
No, don't switch to the automatic pilot.
I'm staying here.
I'll come back when we're at zero feet.
That guy's risking his life.
It's the least I can do.
- I'll stay with you.
- Me, too.
No! There won't be time for us all to get into the escape unit at the last moment.
I'm sending you two back now.
And that's an order!
- Yes, sir.
- Good luck, Paul.
Zero X from Thunderbird 2.
Are you all in escape unit?
Thunderbird 2 from Zero X.
All in escape unit except me.
I can do better than the automatic pilot in holding this craft steady.
I'll go back into the escape unit when it's fixed, or when we're at zero feet.
It'll help. Thanks.
He won't be able to make it in time, surely?
- They're all running out of time.
- How are you doing, Alan?
OK.
- How much time have I got?
- One minute. 
Gordon! Alan isn't through yet, and we're dangerously near the ground.
Play out more cable.
I'm coming alongside Zero X.
OK, Virgil. 
Glenn Field, this is Washington. 
Evacuation of Craigsville is complete. 
Thunderbird 2 from Zero X.
Is he through yet?
No, not yet. 
I'll overrun my engines to give us a few more seconds.
Zero X from Thunderbird 2.
Into escape hatch immediately!
Alan from Virgil. Jump at end of five-second countdown.
Five... 
... four... 
... three... two... 
... one. 
Now!
Now, Scott! Now!
Are you OK, Alan?
OK, Virg. Did they make it?
This is Thunderbird 2 calling
Zero X escape unit. Are you OK?
Thunderbird 2 from Zero X escape unit. 
Yes, we are OK. Paul only just made it. 
He's badly shaken up,
but he's gonna be all right. 
- Did you hear that, Alan?
- I heard.
- Did you hear that, Central Control?
- We heard. Well done!
Virgil from Gordon.
We can't retrieve Alan.
Due to his hurried departure, the cables are fouling the side of Thunderbird 2.
- We'd better drop him to the ground.
- FAB, Gordon. 
Say, Virgil, I think that's FAB 1 below!
Thunderbird 2 from FAB 1.
Virgil, we're down below.
Why not drop Alan down here?
Yeah, Penelope, I can see you!
Say, how did you get here?
As soon as we heard the forecast crash position, we made our way here.
OK, I'm down. Cable released.
Gee, it sure was swell of you to come here and pick me up, Penelope.
After that brilliant performance, I think that's the least you deserve. Now jump in.
I assume, madam, that the first call will be Glenn Field...
...and then on to your hotel.
Is that correct?
That, Parker, is quite correct.
Gee! You mean you're going to take me to the Swinging Star?
- Just the two of us?
- Just the two of us.
It's like a dream... come true.
Gee... this must be the most memorable day of my life.
You know, Penelope, I'm always treated like a kid back at the base.
You know, being the youngest and all.
But tonight, being alone with you,
I feel like a real grown man.
But you are, Alan. You are.
Particularly with that snazzy moustache you're wearing.
- It adds years to you, Alan.
- Well, uh...
We have to wear a disguise sometimes when we're out in public...
...in case we're recognized.
Do you really think it suits me?
Excuse me, Alan. I think the gentleman on the next table wants something.
Hm?
Would you mind passing that ashtray?
- Disguise. Pretty good, eh?
- Why, Dad! What are you doing here?
Just thought I'd come and congratulate you on your great performance today.
- Me too, Alan. A great job.
- Scott!
Thanks to you, Alan, another International Rescue success.
Virg! Who else is here?
And I think it was a splendid effort,
I really do. Even though I can't see you.
Thanks, Brains. And I guess the little lady with you must be Tin Tin.
Yes, Alan. Congratulations on your performance today -
...and tonight.
And there was I, thinking we were all alone!
Remember, Alan...
...one of the most comforting feelings a man can have in this world of ours...
...is never to be alone.
To Alan, the hero of the day!
To Alan!

- Want gas, mister?
- Yeah, fill it up.
Help yourself, will you, please?
I gotta close up.
To you know how to get to Blackbeard's Inn at Godolphin?
I'm goin' there myself. I'll show you the way if you'll give me a lift.
- You're on.
- Thanks.
- Stayin' at the inn?
- Yep.
Mostly old ladies live there.
Salesmen goin' through like to stay in Ye Jolly Roger down in town.
Got more of a chance to kick up their heels.
Well, I'm not a salesman. I'm the new track coach at Godolphin College.
Coach, I'm glad to know you!
My name's Gudger Larkin.
I'm on your track squad.
I'm captain.
Well, well.
Small world, isn't it?
Let's see now, Captain.
I'd guess you were a sprinter, huh?
Golly, no, sir. I'm-I'm as slow as molasses in January.
- Can you give me a hand, Coach?
- Oh, yeah.
- Say, what is your event, Larkin?
- Oh, I'm the shot putter, sir.
Shot putter? Well, the weight man's usually the strongest man on the team.
Yes, sir.
That's the inn, Coach.
That's Blackbeard's Inn.
- Did the old pirate really build it?
- Sure.
He got killed in a battle right out there in the bay.
I guess I'll have to brush up on the local history.
Wait till you meet the little old ladies who run the inn.
They're all descendants of Blackbeard's bloody crew, and they're proud of it.
"Buccaneer Bazaar tonight.
Help save Blackbeard's Inn."
- What does that mean?
- Some guy's trying to have the inn torn down... but the old ladies are putting up a pretty good fight.
You sure they haven't started to tear it down already?
Well, I'll tell you, it's built mostly of odds and ends.
Timbers of ships that got wrecked in the bay.
- You can park over there.
- All right.
What's that all about?
Hey, buddy, l...
That's Silky Seymour.
He runs the gambling around here.
- I wouldn't fool with him.
- What's he doing at the old ladies' bazaar?
He's the guy that bought up their mortgage from the bank.
If the old ladies don't come up with the loot, out they go.
- This fellow Seymour gets everything he wants around here, huh?
- Just about.
Miss Jeffrey, have you seen Miss Stowecroft?
This gentleman has a room reservation.
She's outside in a tent telling fortunes.
- Dean Wheaton.
- What is it?
Sir, l-I'd like you to meet our new track coach.
Steve Walker, sir. Just arrived.
I believe I'm to report to you in the morning.
- Uh, Welcome to Godolphin, Mr Walker.
- Thank you very much, sir.
I don't want to seem negative, but I want to be frank.
I was not in favour of replacing our former track coach when he left so informally.
- Oh?
- For some years now, the track team has done precious little... to add lustre to the name of Godolphin College... so there didn't seem any point in going on with it, you see?
- Well, I'm sorry to hear that, sir...
- Howsoever, we have competed... in the Broxton Relays for the past 63 years... so the alumni insisted on one more try.
Well, of course, sir, there's not much time left before the relay is here... but I hope I can restore your confidence in the boys.
Mr Walker, I never had any.
Well, mmm, before the warmth of the dean's reception goes to my head...
I think I'll find Miss Stowecroft and get a room.
I've been on the road since 5:00 this morning.
- Okay, Coach. I'll see you tomorrow.
- Gudger... uh, what did happen to the other track coach?
I don't know.
He got to actin' real weird.
Talkin' to himself, real down in the chops.
And one day, he just disappeared.
Just... and he was gone.
- Good night, Gudger.
- Good night, Coach.
Oh, Mr Walker.
This is Mr Purvis... our football coach, whom you undoubtedly know by reputation.
Well, I certainly do.
Who doesn't?
We're very fortunate in having the services of Mr Purvis.
He produces winning football teams... which in turn produce gratifyingly large grants and endowments from proud alumni.
Mr Walker is the new coach of what we refer to as the track team.
The track team.
Oh, Walker, you won't last three weeks.
Take my word for it.
Well, if you don't mind, Mr Purvis,
I'd like to find that out for myself.
A word of advice, friend.
At, uh, Godolphin, the name of the game is football.
- That's what makes the mare go around here, so, uh...
- Football.
Don't get any big ideas.
- Wouldn't dream of it.
- Oh, well, come along, Mr Purvis.
I'm sure that Mr Walker will acclimatize very quickly.
Track team!
- Miss Stowecroft?
- Sit down, Ishmael.
No, my name's Steve Walker,
Miss Stowecroft.
I believe a room was arranged for me here through the college.
- You know, living accommodations?
- We accommodate the living.
But who shall accommodate the dead?
Give me your hand, Ishmael.
Oh, no, no, no.
I don't want my fortune told.
Just a room, Miss Stowecroft.
There's a revelation here.
Dark deeds and violence.
Things roused up that were better left to rot.
If you'll tell me where the keys are, Miss Stowecroft...
- I'd be happy to...
- Hold. There's more to the revelation.
- We see good here too.
- Oh, well, that's good.
Happiness. Happiness and content for the people of Godolphin... delivered from an ancient evil, and gratitude to you, Ishmael...
- Oh.
- Who have sacrificed your own life... in their delivery.
Now the light fades.
That is all.
- Now, about the room, Miss Stowecroft...
- That's all.
- Yes, but...
- You may leave an honorarium... for the care and welfare of the spirits in the bowl on your way out.
Oh, thank you. Come again.
Hi.
Hey! What's the big idea?
Well, kisses, one buck, right?
But I don't work here. Can't you read?
I'm executive committee.
I work here.
Well, now, so you do.
Well, that is what I call a real good dollar kiss.
- Plenty of value for the money.
- Would you hold this a minute, please?
How would you like to try the five-dollar special?
Five-dollar special.
May I have my badge?
Thank you.
Oh, no, I'm terribly sorry.
Only one to a customer.
Excuse me.
Oh, Miss Stowecroft.
If I could get that room now, please?
Oh, Ishmael! Come along, please.
The auction is about to begin.
Ladies and gentlemen of Godolphin and neighbouring community... you all know the purpose of this bazaar.
Our good friends, the Daughters of the Buccaneers... took over this old ruin many years ago and turned it into a cultural landmark.
They serve tea, cooked chicken dinners... even turned part of it into a boarding house... anything to keep it going, but that's not enough.
And unless enough money is raised tonight... this place that has been their home for so many years... will pass into the hands of strangers.
So, when Miss Stowecroft begins to auction off... the treasured mementoes, the fine antiques and the family heirlooms... that these good ladies have so generously donated to the cause...
I beg you to search your hearts and to bid cheerfully... boldly and very, very generously.
Thank you. Miss Stowecroft.
Thank you, Professor Baker.
Lot number one.
A fine antique pistol... which has been in the immediate family of Miss Emily Jeffrey... past president of the Daughters of the Buccaneers... for many, many years.
- Now...
- Uh, one dollar.
Oh, can't we do better than that?
Who'll give me $20?
Do I hear $20?
Oh, the gentleman in the back just waved.
The gentleman in the back says, "$20."
Who'll give me $30?
- Thirty dollars.
- Thirty-five dollars.
- Forty.
- Fifty dollars.
- Sixty dollars.
- Seventy.
Do I hear $80?
- Eighty dollars!
- One hundred dollars!
One hundred dollars bid!
Do I hear 110?
Professor Baker, how about your nice young man in the back?
Oh, I don't think so.
He just backed into his shell.
Very well.
One hundred dollars once.
One hundred dollars twice.
Sold!
All right, move in.
- One hundred dollars.
- Thank you.
- Lot number two. A genuine antique...
- You got taken, buddy. This is a fake.
- Copper-bottomed bed warmer.
- Take my advice.
Don't bid on anything else.
- I think well over 250 years old.
- You mean the warming pan is fake too?
That's tourist junk.
- And Mr Seymour don't like to see you throw your money away.
- Ladies and gentlemen... this bed warmer is believed to have been the property of Aldetha Teach... tenth wife of our dear
Captain Blackbeard.
- And now, what am I bid?
- If you want to bid, go ahead, but, uh,
I don't think Mr Seymour would like it.
Mrs Starkey, how about starting the bidding for us?
N-No, thanks.
I, I don't think so.
- How about you, Mr Finch?
- Oh, uh, no, no, thank you.
Uh, Mr Harrison, you'll open the bidding for us, I know.
This pistol's enough for me.
Oh. Will no one open the bidding... on this magnificent item?
- Five dollars!
- Well, thank you.
- Ten dollars.
- Mr Virgil Purvis... our football coach, bids $ 10.
- Fifteen.
- Twenty dollars.
- Twenty-five.
- Thirty dollars.
- Thirty-five.
- Fifty dollars.
- Fifty-five.
- Sixty.
- Sixty-five.
- Seventy!
- Five!
- One hundred dollars!
- As we all know...
Mr Virgil Purvis, our football coach, doesn't like to lose.
He very generously bids $ 100.
Just an opinion, but I wouldn't bid any more if I were you.
- Are there any other bids?
- Well, now, why is that?
- No reason. I just don't want you to.
- One hundred dollars going once.
- Oh.
- One hundred dollars twice.
- Two hundred dollars.
- Two hundred dollars once.
Two hundred dollars twice. Sold to the nice young gentleman in back.
Now we're really rolling!
- Excuse me.
- Lot number three.
Here we have a fascinating piece from colonial times.
The clock in the gentleman's stomach keeps perfect time.
- Now, what am I bid?
- New around here, aren't you?
- Yeah.
- Do I hear $20?
- Just passing through?
- Nope.
- Thirty dollars.
- Might stick around a while, huh?
- Thirty-five dollars.
- Might.
- Thank you.
- We'll see each other again.
- Fifty dollars.
- Good night.
- Eighty dollars.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- How'd you make out?
- Fine. Much better than we expected.
- Thank you.
- That's good. No problem, then?
Oh, I wish that were true.
We still have another $38,000... to give Mr Seymour before the first of the month.
Say, why is Mr Seymour so anxious to get his hands on this property anyway?
Here, I'll show you on the map.
You see, this is... this is the island we're on.
Well, in Blackbeard's time, the river flowed this way.
And the inn wasn't on an island at all.
It was part of the mainland.
Then about, oh, 80 years ago, we had this terrible flood and a storm... and the, uh, the river changed its course... isolating the inn from the mainland.
As a result, nobody's ever been able to clarify... what the legal jurisdiction of the island really is.
- Th-That's where Mr Seymour comes in?
- Sure.
He can tear down the inn, put up a big, modern casino...
- and the law can't bother him.
- Mm-hmm.
Oh, uh, well, I'd like to thank you for what you did tonight.
You know, without you, we wouldn't have had much of an auction.
Well, I just kept bidding because it made you smile.
I like that smile.
Jo Anne, aren't you re...
I've been waiting to drive you home.
Excuse me. Good night.
Good night.
I'm going to put you in his room.
I'm sure he won't mind.
- He?
- Captain Blackbeard.
- Oh.
This looks out to the river and to the upper bay.
Oh, the captain used to stand here for hours with his spyglass... studying the ships moving in and out.
He'd pick out the one he liked... then he'd come here to this very table... and with his men, he'd plan how to seize it.
Well, thank you, Miss Stowecroft.
I know how anxious you must be to get to bed, so...
Sometimes when he's in a bad mood or feeling Ionely... we hear him thumping around, breaking glasses and bottles... trying so hard to communicate with us.
I suppose we should all be very angry with him for all that noise.
But, you know, it isn't his fault, poor man.
Then, whose fault is it?
- Aldetha's, of course.
- Who?
Number ten.
The captain's last wife, but one.
Oh, the one your warming pan belonged to.
- Oh. Well, good...
- Aldetha was a witch, you know.
She never forgave the captain for denouncing her to the authorities.
When they were burning
Aldetha at the stake... she put a terrible curse on him.
As the flames crept higher and higher... she screeched her dying words:
"Edward Teach, sometimes known as Captain Blackbeard...
"when you come to die, may your body and soul...
"be racked between this world and the next...
"always to be alone.
"May this curse hold fast and true.
"May you dwell forevermore in limbo...
"or until such time as there be found in you...
"most wicked of all villains... some spark of human goodness."
Well, good night, Mr Walker.
Sleep well.
The dining room will be open for breakfast at 7:30 a.m.
Oh, please be prompt.
Oh, no.
Two hundred bucks.
"Aldetha Teach."
Well, so the thing did belong to her.
"Her book of spells and conjurations."
Well, now.
"A spell to turn your enemy into a spotted toad."
"A spell to turn mercury into gold."
I wonder if there's a spell to make a track team out of a pig's ear.
"A spell to bring to your eyes and ears... one who is bound in limbo."
Well, how about that? Limbo.
Curses. Pirates. Malarky.
Blackbeard himself was a phony.
He was probably some chicken-livered little pipsqueak... that built up a reputation scaring old women and children.
Chicken-livered pipsqueak, is it?
A remark spoke slighted like that... could raise a man's blood now, could it not?
I've been on the road since 5:00 this morning. I'm just tired.
Nothing to eat. Miss Stowecroft gassed me up with pirate stories.
I'm all right. I'm just tired.
Boy, am I tired!
I don't think you're real.
I don't think that sword is real!
And I'm gonna walk right through it and go to bed!
Try it, mate.
- It's real.
- Who called me out?
- What?
- Who invoked me?
Aldetha's writing. No!
Aldetha done it.
"Beware," cried me shipmates.
"Sheer off. That girl, she be a true witch."
And I paid no heed.
Oh, Aldetha.
To do that to your legal spoke husband. Oh!
The story is,
Blackbeard had her burned.
Burned? I never put a taper to her. Never.
Oh, I own that down in the horse latitudes, on a dull day...
I might've keel-hauled a wife or two, or else walked one off the end of a plank, yes.
But I never did it for spite.
Funny thing about me.
Never did it for spite.
I might've done it out of, uh, jest... to keep the spirit of me shipmates up.
And now to real business.
Where'd you stow it?
- What? What?
- Your rum.
- I don't drink.
- Don't drink?
Ship's stores.
Have to seek succor there.
Ah, Mrs Stowecroft, your humble servant. Servant.
A bottle of rum
No glasses are left
I'll drink from the bottle with you, sir
You don't know what you're missing, son.
- She didn't see you.
- Aye?
- She didn't even hear you.
- Oh, why should she?
I'm a kind of a ghost, you know.
In limbo, caught twixt this world and the next... beholden to that spell which brings me to your eyes only.
You mean, no one can see you except me?
That's about the shape of it, son.
And that's why I'll be sailing alongside of you, see?
Wheresoever thou goest, there also will I go.
So let's drink to that. Are you sure you don't want to freshen your spleen?
Now, let's get one thing straight!
I want nothing to do with you!
I'm go...
I'm gonna go to bed... and you can go back into the woodwork or wherever it is you came from!
Belay that tongue! One thing old Blackbeard don't take kindly to... it's them sort of "insinuendos."
Come to think of it, I don't care for the cut of your jib, neither.
If I were to lay this course,
I'd choose myself a companion... a hearty companion, with a little blood on his sleeve... and a predilection for rum, for song... and for the occasional wench.
But what have I got? Hmm?
I've got a shindly little beanrake.
- Now, wait!
- Yes, I have. With the shakes and the whimpers.
- What do you mean the sh-shakes and...
- Doesn't even want to join me in a drink.
We're stuck with one another, you and I.
The cruise may well be a long one, so you'd better make the best of it.
And I take this opportunity of bidding you a very good night.
Hey! Hey, wait a minute!
Get off of my bed!
- Your bed?
- My bed!
"My bed"? I captured it from a Portugee trader at the sack of Cartagena!
- I spitted him clean and sweet against the headboard!
- Well, l...
Don't rush me.
There it is.
There's your Portugee, what's left of him.
Well, if you think
I'm gonna sleep on the floor, you've got another thing coming!
Oh, well then, welcome aboard and drop your hook.
Devil is the man whoever said that old Teach was inhospitable.
All I ask is to be able to get to sleep, because I know... because I know that when I wake up tomorrow morning, none of this will have ever happened.
Nine men... Down!
Oh, when nine and twenty Spanish lads
You pull it on the sheets, my boy
Up! The Jolly Roger!
Wind freshening, aye, Mr Bellamy.
El Portugee, it's your daughter
I'm after, senor, not your bed.
Don Mendoza, we meet again.
Pick up your weapon, sir.
Take my regards to the king of Spain!
Bellamy! Oh!
That's it!
That is absolutely it!
Figment of my imagination or no figment, he can have his room.
He can have his bed!
I don't need it.
I'm going to the Ye Jolly Roger Motel where the salesmen go.
Well, nothing like a little fresh air to straighten you out.
For a while there, I almost believed there was a pirate.
Oh, no. You're back! Right?
That be about the measure of it, lad.
I fear there's no way of being rid of dear old Blackbeard.
Well, that's great.
That is just great!
I couldn't have an ordinary ghost on my hands! I got a rummy!
- A big, ugly, booze-soaked rummy!
- Hold on there!
There be no call to put the fuddler's name on your new-found shipmate.
Uh, look, lad...
I've been very Ionely, see.
I'm just an old hulk, wrecked on a lee shore.
All my shipmates gone, no one to listen to me no more.
You don't care for me, that's plain as print.
- Shut up, will ya? Shut up.
Ju-Ju-Just shut up.
- Aye. Aye, aye.
You wouldn't have such a thing as an handkerchief...
- on your person, would you?
- I don't have a handkerchief.
- Oh, you must, do you?
- Keep your hands to yourself!
No!
What manner of craft be this we're cruisin' in?
- What?
- This craft.
- Oh. It's an automobile.
- Aye?
- An automobile!
- Oh, is it? Yes, "automotonees."
- Yes, "autosomonees."
- Hey, sit down!
It's propelled by some kind of animal under the hatch, is it?
No, it isn't! Sit down now.
Hey, what do you think you're doing?
- I've a mind to have a hand at the helm.
- Well, you've got another mind coming!
- You're gonna kill us, you idiot!
- Take your hands off the spokes... or I'll bend a marlinspike around your loaf!
- I'll take that wheel.
- I haven't finished my turn yet.
- Wait!
- Get away from there! It's my turn.
- Get your hands off the wheel!
- Feels like a weather helm, don't it?
- I'll show her who's master!
- No! No, no! No, no! No, no!
No, no, no!
- We're in the breakers, boy!
- Get out!
Back the main braces!
Stand by to wear ship now!
Take your foot off of my gas!
- Look out!
- Read about. Hard alee. Hard alee.
Avast, ya lubber!
What are you doin' in the main channel?
Oh, no, not a policeman!
Let... Let go! Let go!
Look, I'll give you the wheel later.
Right now, l...
You've done it now, you dumb ox!
Steer out of the whirlpool!
Man overboard!
Your driver's licence, please.
- Who's the popinjay?
- Will you stay out of this?
Well, Mr Walker, I see we've been out getting our nose wet somewhere tonight.
It so happens, I don't drink.
And what is that on the seat beside you?
- It looks like a bottle of rum.
- May I have it, please?
I believe you're right, Mr Walker.
It is a bottle of rum.
Let the swab find his own rum, I say!
Will you give me this bottle and stop maying a nuisance out of yourself?
I'll take charge of that bottle, if you don't mind.
You let go of the bottle, you idiot!
No need for epithets, Mr Walker.
I'm only trying to do my job.
I'm afraid destruction of the evidence isn't going to help you any, Mr Walker.
Now this be the foulest crime of all... wasting good spirits.
By thunder, this raises me blood!
No, don't do it!
There's no need for you to get emotional about this.
You've had the fun.
Now you can take the consequences.
All right, lad, all right.
I shan't harm him.
But this gentleman needs a lesson in manners.
It's plain to see that you're starting to come apart at the seams.
All itchy, twitchy, talking to yourself.
- Cut it out, will you, Blackbeard?
- All right, get out of the car!
Hey, watch that thing! It's probably...
Hey, look out, will you!
Five balls in one load, mate.
Five!
Many's the time off the Maricaibos...
I could've done with a prime little darling like that.
Give way, you landlubber!
The key, you idiot!
The key!
Turn off the key!
Think you can get away from me, do you?
Calling Patrolman 9, we're at the corner of...
Hey, lad, that be better sport than riding a humpback whale in a hurricane!
Hey, care for a drench, son?
It'll brighten your scan.
- You're still here, huh?
- Aldetha's testament, I see.
Studying some way to get rid of poor old Blackbeard, are you?
- How'd you guess?
- I have been observing thee... and I note that you have a bent for getting yourself into trouble.
I get into trouble?
Oh, that is really rich!
Who do you suppose put me here?
Well, do you think I like this mortal life of yours?
Aye, there doesn't seem to be any honest joy any more.
Your modern life of yours seems to have got small.
Everything's puckered up.
You call this a four-poster bed?
Clear the way there!
I'm down.
You won't get no comfort out of that.
If it's Aldetha laid that spell, you can mark it a good one, without no loophole.
Now, wait a minute.
Mrs Stowecroft told me that curse.
Something about you having to dwell forevermore in limbo.
- Limbo.
- Then something, something, something...
Until there be found in you some spark of human goodness.
- What's the matter?
- Aldetha was bright as brass.
She knew me like a book.
Well, you must have done something good.
Did you ever...
Did you ever pat a dog?
- A dog?
- Yeah.
- Pet it?
- Yes.
- No, I never did pet it.
- Did you ever help an old lady across the street?
- That's silly.
- Anything?
- No.
- No.
No, we're sunk, you and me.
Dead as pork. Might as well... face up to it.
Hey. Hey, the little old ladies, the Daughters of the Buccaneers.
Your own kith and kin, some of them.
Give them your treasure.
- My treasure?
- Yeah.
The one that people have been talking about for so long. It's hidden somewhere around here, isn't it?
- Never mind.
- Eh?
- Why should I give them my treasure?
- Why, you great ape?
Because you can do some good with it.
You can help them.
In helping them, you might help yourself. You might break the curse.
- You thinks this, does ye?
- Yes, I thinks this.
If you help those little old ladies save their home... they'll name public schools and bridges and highways after you.
Can't you see it?
Teach Park.
Teach Highway. See?
The Edward Teach, uh, Memorial, uh, Free Day Nursery.
- Free?
- For babies.
- Oh, for babies.
- Yeah.
- Named for me, a wicked old pirate?
- Yeah.
And for nothing more than a few chests of doubloons and a few strands of precious jewels?
- You bet they will.
- And in spite of the fact... that I've got the blood of a thousand gallant lads still on my hands?
Will you forget the blood!
I mean, I'm trying!
Look, crack loose with the treasure, huh? It's the only way.
- Well, it don't sound right to me.
- Of course it doesn't sound right to you!
How would a creep like you know the difference between right and wrong?
That's why the curse held on so long. Now, come on.
- Where's the treasure?
- Well, I suppose I must trust you.
- Yeah. Where is it?
- The treasure?
- Yeah.
- Want to know the treasure?
- Yeah.
Hmm? Where is it?
Where's the treasure?
- There ain't no treasure.
- There ain't... What?
No! Not a penny. There's not a doubloon.
There's not a bent or damaged peseta.
That is one of the most outrageous things that I have ever...
Do you realize people have been searching for that treasure for over two centuries? Huh?
Poor, unfortunate souls grubbing and digging in the dirt!
I'm not good for nothing!
I'm not, I'm not!
Grubbing in the dirt, old poor people there...
Oh, don't start crying again.
Look, you must have saved a few coins somewhere. Something?
- No, no.
- I did have a treasure.
- Yeah?
- I had a big treasure.
- Yeah?
- Lovely, I did.
- Yes.
- I spent it all in one week... among the fleshpots and gambling halls of Port Royal.
- Oh, it was a glorious week, that was.
- You know what you are?
You are a 100% total loss.
You're not even a respectable ghost!
You're a phony!
- Aye?
- A phony!
Oh, I've run aground.
If you ask me, the guy was stoned.
I say get rid of him.
The police report said they released him for lack of evidence.
It says, "Although the atmosphere at the police station... reeked of cheap rum, the test showed no trace of alcohol in his system."
Oh, he probably figured some cute way to neutralize the booze.
Pills or something. Science is doing all kinds of stuff like that these days.
Well, there's a corollary.
It says that Mr Walker spoke loudly to someone in his cell all night long.
Well, there's nothing wrong with that.
It happened there was on one in the cell with him.
So he's either stoned or he's nuts.
Either way, who needs it?
Professor, I left last night before the auction.
Did you notice anything unusual in Mr Walker's behaviour?
- Yes, I did.
- There. You see?
When Silky Seymour and his cheap hoodlums scared the daylights out of everyone else... he is the only one that stood up like a man.
Now, wait a minute, Jo Anne.
That's not fair.
If I may remind you, Dean, the
Broxton Relays take place next month, and our team needs its coach.
- They need Mr Walker.
- I still say we ought to saw him off.
This guy's not gonna come up with anything.
Just a minute, Mr Purvis.
Now, we have fielded a team in the
Broxton Relays for the past 63 years.
We'll carry on the tradition as best we can with Mr Walker.
Well, I'm sure you won't regret it.
- Oh, Professor?
- Yes?
I realize that your field is child psychology... however I'd appreciate it if you'd keep an informal eye on Mr Walker's behaviour.
Oh, certainly.
It's the least I can do.
Thank you.
Mr Purvis, does it strike you as odd... that sooner or later, all our track coaches seem to crack up?
I can understand the others, but this one hasn't even seen the team.
Say, why has Fellspahr got his fingers in his ears? That's...
- It's on account of the starter, sir.
- You mean he's...
Yes, sir.
Fellspahr is afraid of guns.
Th-The way I figure it,
Coach, is we need more time to whip these boys into shape.
You don't suppose they could postpone the Broxton meet, do you?
No.
Okay, fellas, that's it for today.
Hit the showers.
Right, Coach. Let's go, fellas!
You all go now! Lots of spirit!
How fares your day today, eh?
As if I don't have enough troubles.
For a short, wonderful while there,
I thought I'd lost you.
You know where I've been?
I've been in Godolphin Town... roaming the streets and shores of my young manhood...
- Yeah.
- Soaking myself in nostalgia.
I know. I can smell it!
And you know, as fate would have it...
I went down to one of these here gambling establishments...
- by name Silky's Place.
- Hey, take off, will you?
- I've got a lot to do.
- And I overheard what some of the natives are saying... on this here subject of gambling, see?
- Go away! I mean it!
- Now, if there's been one abiding passion in my life... it's been the pleasure of gold or silver coin upon a wager.
So when I heard that I could get 40 or... listen to this... 50 to 1... on the forthcoming enterprise of your young rabbits...
- Ooh, with all that...
- What?
You want your lads to win, don't you?
I can teach you how to do it.
- Forget it!
- Why should I?
I was a good hand at teaching young crews.
'Twas no accident, by thunder,
I was known as the finest pirate... ever to sail the Spanish Main.
Or the Portugee Main either, for that matter.
Now you'll be asking yourself with some impatience, "Why was this?"
I'll tell you why.
I trained my men to win!
Win! Always win!
By fair means or foul, by soft words and hard deeds... by treachery, by cunning, by malpractice... but always win.
You mean you have the unmitigated brass to ask me to let you train my team?
I'm not doing this for myself, believe me. No.
I'm doing this for those dear, sweet old ladies.
- Oh, yeah?
- Yes, I am.
The little lavender-scented ladies,
I like to call them... that stagger up their rickety staircases of the night... their lanterns held aloft when the lights got too bad for knitting by... and say to one another,
"Ellen, where is our ship?"
Of which Blackbeard is captain.
"And which may never now come to port at all."
Never mind the snow job!
I feel just as sorry for those old women as you do, but that doesn't...
- No.
- Yes, I do. That doesn't give you leave to put your bloody paws onto my team.
Now, you stay away from those boys, you understand me?
If we win anything, which I doubt, we're gonna do it without cheating.
Without cheating? Ha-ha!
You've never lived, boy.
You don't know what life is like.
Just go away! Go maroon yourself somewhere, will ya?
- Let me help you.
- Go on! Go on!
You don't know what life is made of!
Little old things...
You see?
There he goes again.
Well, I don't know what his problem is.
But whatever it is, it's a beaut.
I take it your observations so far have been inconclusive.
Well, I can't tell if he's all keyed up over the track meet... or if there are outside pressures we don't know about.
L... Well, I just haven't been able to get a close-range view.
- Pity.
- Oh, I am having dinner with him tonight.
Ah, he asked you to have dinner?
Well, not exactly.
I asked him.
Do you think that's wise?
Well, it's entirely within my discretionary power... as head of the committee to welcome new faculty and students to Godolphin College.
Professor Baker, we don't have any such committee.
- Well, we do now.
- Oh. Oh, yes.
Hello, Professor.
Nice to see you.
Mr Walker, so we meet again.
- Looks that way.
- Tell you what.
Let me buy you a good lobster dinner.
Afterwards, we'll drop into the back rooms and have a whirl at lady luck, huh?
Well, thank you, but, well, that's not likely.
Suit yourself. There's no harm in asking, is there?
Leon, these are friends of mine.
See that they get a nice table.
Yes, sir.
This way, please.
Enjoy your dinner.
- What's he doing here?
- Mr Seymour owns this place.
I'm sorry, but it's the best restaurant in town.
How's the action?
I can't tell you how much
I appreciate this.
- Appreciate what?
- Your suggesting dinner tonight.
That's perfectly all right.
The committee stands ready... to advise, counsel, and extend a helping hand to the newcomer at all times.
Yes, that's very nice. Actually,
I do need someone I can talk to.
I've had a problem for a couple of weeks now... and I've been afraid to talk to somebody because... they might think I was silly.
- Well, please go on.
- Thank you.
You see, it started the night of the auction.
I sat down on the bed to remove my shoes.
I was tired. I wasn't paying too much attention to what I was doing... and I sat right down on that antique bed warmer.
- I broke the handle right off.
- Oh, well, you mustn't let that bother you.
- Oh, no, it wasn't that.
- No, l-I think I have th-the address... of a little shop down on Main Street where we can get it fixed.
No, Professor, wait a minute.
Wow!
What's the matter?
Aren't you afraid to carry all that around with you?
Oh, well, I'm... I hate to leave it in the apartment.
I'm-I'm taking it to the bank in the morning. It belongs to the Daughters of the Buccaneers.
Oh, oh, yeah. The little old ladies and their mortgage.
I hope they're gonna make it.
Mr Walker, this is only $900.
Unless $37,000 or a miracle, preferably both... turn up by tomorrow night, midnight, those little ladies are gonna lose their home.
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
Say, uh, can't you borrow the money from the bank?
Well, not at the moment, but, uh, then we were talking about your problem.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, my problem.
- Mr Walker?
- Yeah?
- Are we looking for somebody?
- Yes, my problem.
Look, I know your first inclination is gonna be... boy, is gonna be not to believe this.
- Hear me out, please.
- Certainly.
Well, as I said, it was the night of the auction.
- When I sat down on my bed warmer, that's when he first appeared.
- He?
Yeah, yeah, yeah. It was because of him
I spent the first night in jail...
- and I haven't been able to get him off my back yet.
- Well, is, uh, is he here now?
No, no, no, no.
I don't see him around now.
- But I smell him.
- Smell him?
Yes, he's got a breath that would stun a horse.
He's a booze-guzzling old cutthroat, and he's latched onto me as his buddy-buddy.
Well, uh, does he have a name?
Well, I mean, who does he claim to be?
Blackbeard's ghost.
- Blackbeard's ghost?
- Yeah.
Well, how can you be sure he's the real Blackbeard's ghost, the ghost of Captain Teach?
Well, you ought to see him.
He's got whiskers, he's got a cutlass, he's got the whole bit.
- That must be who
I saw you talking to today.
- Yes, yes, yes.
That's what I've been afraid to tell anybody.
I mean, they'd think I was nuts.
Oh, well, I don't think anybody would think that.
But you certainly do have a problem.
- I've got a problem.
I've got a problem.
- Oh, yes, you...
- Will you order now, sir?
- Uh, yes, yes, thank you.
- Madame.
- Oh, thank you.
Our shore dinners are very good this evening, sir.
Well, that sounds... sounds good to me.
How about you, Professor?
- Oh, the shore dinners are excellent. Yeah, that's fine.
- Fine, fine. Uh, two shore dinners.
Very good, sir. Now, would you like our special dressing on your salads?
- That's fine.
- Thank you.
- Oh, please, go on.
- Oh. Oh, are you sure you want me to?
- I mean, I don't want to bug somebody else with my problems.
- Oh, no, no. I want to hear.
- Okay.
- Uh, you were telling me how you first met Captain Blackbeard.
Right.
- Where was I?
- Well, you were sitting on your antique bed warmer.
Right. The handle broke right off.
Do you know it turned out to be hollow?
I thought nothing of it for a moment, then I noticed... there was something rolled up inside... a dusty old paper.
I thought it was gonna fall apart right in my hands.
It gave me kind of a funny feeling.
Oh! Oh, you poor man.
- Waiter, did you hurt yourself?
- I'm so sorry.
- Oh, that's quite all right.
It's just a little water.
- No harm done.
- Will madame please forgive me?
- Certainly.
- Hi, Danny.
- Hi.
You just missed the first race at Green Meadows.
Godolphin... to win...
Nine hundred dollars.
They're in the starting gate now.
There's the rabbit, and they're off!
Coming past the grandstand is Pilsen leading the field.
- Hello Baby is second...
- Come on, Baby!
Rainy Weather, third and Daddy Dumpling is fourth.
At the first turn, it's Pilsen by two lengths...
Rainy Weather moving into second,
Hello Baby and Daddy Dumpling.
- In the back stretch, it's Pilsen...
- This your bet, Danny?
- Daddy Dumpling is second, coming up.
- What do you think I'm standing here for?
Rainy Weather is fading.
Hello Baby is fading.
- I hope you know what you're doin'.
- Let me worry about that, will ya?
- It's Pilsen...
- Be right back.
Hello Baby.
Oh, Mr Seymour, take a look at this.
- Godolphin to win? Who's the patsy?
- Danny Oley. Okay?
Listen, his money's as good as anybody else's.
- Uh, what price are you making?
- On this one? Anything.
For an old customer like Danny, let's make it interesting... say, 50 to 1.
At the three-quarter pole, it's Daddy Dumpling.
Aunt Pavla is second. Pilsen is third.
Dandy Andy moving into fourth.
- It's Daddy Dumpling...
- Okay, Danny.
Into the stretch it's Dandy Andy and Aunt Pavla...
Daddy Dumpling and Snow Queen.
At the finish, it's Snow Queen,
Aunt Pavla and Daddy Dumpling.
Winsome Lass to win in the second.
- What's the matter?
- You just made a bet.
Something closing in on you, Pops?
This is my bet.
- Fifty on Winsome Lass to win.
- Danny, don't you remember?
You bet Godolphin $900 to win the Broxton Relay.
I bet... Come on, will ya?
I wouldn't bet on Godolphin to start with the letter "G."
Well, skipping all the-the technical language and getting down to the point, uh... l-I would say, if you'll ignore him, he'll go away.
And may I tell you something?
He's not so easy to ignore.
Oh, please try.
I know you can do it.
You know, Professor, sitting... sitting here with you like this...
I almost believe you're right.
- I will try.
- Bravo!
Now just say, "Farewell, Blackbeard.
Bother me no more."
Farewell, Blackbeard. Bother me no more.
I like the sound of that.
But just in case that it doesn't work, may I feel free to call on you at any time?
Somehow, you give me a feeling of security.
Oh. Well, certainly.
L... Well, there's no point in being the head of a committee... unless you intend to do your job properly.
- How true.
- Yeah.
Oh, no.
Sorry about the ice cream, madame.
Oh, it's quite all right... but, uh, I think I'll skip dessert.
Yeah, yeah.
Uh, just the check, please.
- Here we are. Uh, keep the change.
- Thank you.
Shall we?
- Oh.
- Come along.
- Excuse me.
- Good night.
- Good night, madame.
- Good night now.
- Thank you.
Uh, good night, ma'am.
Good night, sir.
- Good night.
- Good night.
How do you do, ladies and gentlemen?
Mel Willis here.
And welcome to Sports Spectacular... coming to you this week from Broxton Field... home of the famous national track and field event... the Broxton Invitational Relays.
Now, as you sports fans know... there are some four college teams represented here tonight.
At least three of these squads are numbered among the outstanding teams in the nation.
As for the fourth, little Godolphin
College from across the river...
Well, in the old days, the Godolphin track squad took a back seat to no one.
They had a great tradition.
But those good old days seem to be gone forever.
I want you to look at this event not as an ordinary track meet... but as a preparation for life.
Now, some of you are gonna be graduating soon.
You're gonna find the world out there full of nothing but trouble... frustration and... and strife.
And I tell you right now that nowhere will you find a better preparation... for that world outside than to be a member of this particular track team.
All right, it's time to go.
But I want you to know, no matter what happens out there tonight... in my heart, each and every one of you is a champion.
Let's go!
Oh, pardon me, Professor.
Oh, Jo Anne. Nice of you to come.
We can use all the good wishes we can get.
Well, I certainly do wish you and your team good luck.
- However, that is not why I'm here.
- Oh.
You may recall that, uh, last night
I placed the sum of $900 in my bag... and when I opened it this morning...
I found this in its place.
"$900 on Godolphin."
Jo Anne...
I appreciate the gesture of confidence, but you shouldn't have done it.
Mr Walker, in the first place,
I do not bet.
And in the second place, if I did,
I certainly would not embezzle funds... that have been placed in my trust to do it.
Well, then how did it happen?
Well, I believe you were the only person to know that I had that money in my purse.
It's that rotten pirate.
He did it!
Can you imagine, taking money meant for those little old ladies?
- Well, someone took it.
- Now I remember. Now l...
Your purse went off...
You don't think I did it, do you?
Well, you can't expect me to credit that story.
Well, Jo Anne, that's exactly what happened!
Besides, didn't you say you believed in the pirate?
Well, not $900 worth!
Besides, I believe in him as... as a-a metaphysical image... not some stupid, sticky-fingered goop.
Well, that's exactly what he is!
- Hurry up, Coach. It's beginning.
- I'll be right there.
- Okay.
- Mr. Walker, l-I shan't bother you any more.
I want you to know that I understand perfectly.
Your motives were good, even though your reasoning was perfectly idiotic!
With the captain and the bottle
You regard me strangely, son.
Something amiss?
- You took that money.
- Money? Money.
Oh, the odd flimsy I removed from the purse of your, uh, bookish wench.
Why should that stir your ire?
Because it belongs to the little old ladies!
Now, lookee here.
You know as well as I do I replaced that money with a piece of paper... what will bring great wealth to them small old ladies.
Money in fifty-fold!
Oh, I can't trust no one.
- I'll deal with this matter personally.
- Wait a minute.
Just how do you figure to do that?
By bringing a victory in this sport event... which is taking place out there this moment.
- Aha! I told you once to keep...
Give me that rubbing alcohol!
- Hey! Oh!
- That's a dangerous move, me hearty.
- That's not to drink, you idiot!
- What are you trying to do, kill yourself?
- Little late to think about that, isn't it?
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Let's get one thing straight between you and me right now.
You're to keep your grubby paws off of my boys. You understand that?
I don't know what you're trying to do out there, but you are not gonna do it.
My team may not win out there, but whatever they do... they're gonna do it honestly.
Come on, Coach, will ya? We've come in last in two events already.
Hands off. You got that?
"Come on, Coach, will ya? We've come in last in two events already."
Another bean rake.
All right, play it whatever way you like, ya puppy.
Get no help from me.
You'll come crawlin' back, you will.
I'll bring my boot to you, and I'll grind your mealy-mouthed jib... into the dirt!
I will.
Ladies and gentlemen, it's going just about as I predicted.
Broxton has won the first three events, followed by Tidewater Tech and State... and lastly, little Godolphin College... which has not scored a single point... nor, in my humble opinion, seems likely to.
The discus throw. LJ Sewell of
Broxton College, the first contestant.
Ladies and gentlemen, it looks like a new meet record!
In the discus throw,
Sewell of Broxton College...
210 feet and 11 inches.
Now, you're gonna do fine, Bagwell.
Just remember to let go on the second turn, huh?
- Let go, second turn. Right, Coach.
- Okay.
Bagwell of Godolphin College ready on the discus throw.
Oh, how I dread this.
Let go!
Bagwell, let go of the discus!
- Bagwell of Godolphin College fouls.
- You know, Dean, this whole thing bugs me.
You take the profits made by my football boys, then go right out and blow it... on sweat socks and stuff for this crummy team.
- Excuse me.
- Would you be good enough to spare me your usual soliloquy on sweat socks?
Mr Seymour, may I speak with you for a moment, please?
Why, certainly, Professor, anytime.
Run along, fellas.
Now, Professor, what can I do for you?
Well, yesterday, uh...
I shan't explain how, but...
$900 belonging to the Daughters of the Buccaneers... was bet on Godolphin.
Say, now.
So the bet was all your doing, huh?
Well, l... I was wondering... if you would be kind enough to cancel the bet and give us back the money?
Professor, as you know,
I'm a man of principle.
And man and boy, my guiding principle has always been a bet's a bet.
But look at those poor old ladies.
What's gonna happen to them?
You know they have nowhere to go.
I've been thinking about those dear old girls... living in that drafty inn, working their fingers to the bone... living from hand to mouth... cluttering up that valuable piece of real estate.
Now, do they know about this?
Of course not.
I wouldn't dare raise false hopes.
Then you won't give it back?
Sweetness, what do you take me for?
Oh, Professor, you'd better hold onto this.
That may become very valuable someday.
I know your sort.
Ready for the start of the mile run.
Contestants will take their positions.
My great, great granddaughters.
By thunder!
There be a time for action!
Old ladies, Blackbeard's coming.
Up the Jolly Roger!
Well, let's see where we stand now.
The mile run is in its second lap.
Leading at the moment is Broxton.
Over at the high jump,
Shockley of Godolphin.
- What was that?
- Unusual jumping style there.
Hey, Coach, Shockley just cleared 6' 11 "!
- Our Shockley?
- And they're trying for seven feet!
Shockley of Godolphin jumping.
- He clears the bar at seven feet.
- Great stuff, Coach.
Where did you find him?
Well, we never know, do we?
It only proves that nothing is certain in the world of... Just a moment.
Here's the final lap of the mile run coming around now.
- Where did you find him, Coach?
- Get out of there! Excuse me.
- You idiot! Get off the track!
- What's going on over here?
Hey, fella, come back here!
I don't need these, of course, but just for a moment there... it looked as though they were running backward.
- Come on back!
- They are.
Keep going! Keep going!
Come join the mollies dance, lad!
'Twill raise your reedy spirits.
I'm telling you to get off this field... right now!
If you ask me, he makes a better pom-pom girl than he does a coach.
It's Chulay of Godolphin, ready with thejavelin throw.
- Stop! Stop!
- Where do you think you're going, Coach?
270 feet, 4 inches for Chulay of Godolphin.
The shot put event. Wilkins of
Broxton College, the first contestant.
What do you mean, you want to enter a protest? Didn't you win those last three events?
That's just the point.
It wasn't us, it was...
Look. Now, look. Look.
He's at it again.
Okay, I'm looking.
Wilkins, a little off form tonight.
That comes to 5 feet, 11 inches.
Now, did you see that?
Okay, he flubbed one.
What's the big problem?
And now, Gudger Larkin of Godolphin is ready with his effort.
It's really not much of a...
It seems to be coming this way.
Impossible.
72 feet, 3 inches... a new shot put record for Larkin.
Excuse me, but I have to see some sweet old ladies about a bet.
Godolphin to win?
Have you gone out of your mind?
Not yet, but the evening's still young.
Mr Seymour!
- Why don't you stop your babbling and get out of here?
- Well, if you'd just listen to what I have to say.
- We're under pressure too!
- The pole vault bar is set at 17 feet, 5 inches.
First contestant,
Carson of Broxton College.
- I knew he'd go too far!
- Nail him!
Mr. Walker, one more disturbance, you'll be ruled off the field entirely.
- Now, is that clear?
- Second contestant on the pole vault.
Neilson of Godolphin College... sets a new record of 17 feet,
5 inches in the pole vault.
- Go, Godolphin, go!
- I never saw you get this excited at a football game.
Yea, Godolphin!
May I tell you something, Mr Purvis?
Yea, Godolphin! Go!
I hate football.
Yea, Godolphin! I've always hated football! Go, go, go!
Well, lad, what do you think of your old matey now, eh?
They could hang me for what I think of you know! Didn't I tell you... to keep your hands off of my boys?
Oh, you do, do you?
Well, let me simply say you are the lowest, most underhanded... miserable excuse for what used to be a human being that's ever been my misfortune... to be in any shape, way or form connected with!
- I thought I was helping you.
- Helping? Well, that's a yuck for ya!
Didn't you say yourself that if
I helped them old ladies... that that would contribute towards me own salvation?
You haven't helped them.
You haven't helped anybody.
Haven't helped anybody?
I perceive now how difficult it is... to do a good deed in this dirty world.
Just go away. Just go away.
Just get out of my life.
- No, no, no.
- You mean nothing but trouble.
You mean... I can see now... why the very mention of your name used to give everybody the creeps.
Well, I'm gonna find a comfortable place.
I'm gonna rest there, somewhere.
- And I'm gonna stay out of your affairs.
- Great, great.
That's the best news I've had in years.
Go disappear yourself.
I'm gonna disappear myself, that's what I'm gonna do.
Mr Sanctimonious Scupperlout!
Sink me if I raise so much as a finger to help you in the future.
I'd rather spend a winter of eternities in limbo... than knock knees a tick longer... with a nit like you.
- There, I've said it.
- The final event of the evening, the relay races, are about to begin.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I had to do that. You see what he's trying to do, don't you? Hmm?
Well, the rotten pirate wants to make me as-as crooked as he is.
Well, I don't buy it.
I'm standing on my principles.
Why, sure, Coach. Where'd any of us be without our principles?
You betcha.
You betcha.
Tiny Godolphin College, perennial underdog for two decades... has come back with the biggest bang you've ever seen.
Coach Walker of Godolphin, the man of the hour.
Throwing in an attack of dazzling new techniques... his inspired team of star performers... has slashed its way up into a tie with Broxton.
Now victory hangs in the balance as we come to the final event of the evening.
The question... What is going to happen as Godolphin faces...
Broxton's mighty relay team?
Gentlemen, take your marks.
Set.
Come on, Broxton!
Run, you punk!
Go, Godolphin! Come on, team!
Come on, team! Yea!
At we come to the end of the first lap in this crucial race... the first three runners are closely bunched.
Now they pass the baton for the start of the second lap.
It's Broxton first,
Tidewater second, State third...
Yes, and there's the Godolphin man, labouring along in the rear.
Easy now, Coach.
You're tensing up again.
Maybe I shouldn't have yelled at him that way.
I mean, how's a poor, dumb pirate supposed to know what principles are, huh?
But I do. I've gotta shave this face every morning.
- I know, Coach. I shave too.
- You bet you do.
You gotta look at yourself.
You've gotta live with yourself.
- I gotta go with my principles.
- Sure, Coach. You do that.
- I will, I will.
Well, folks, it's just about all over but the shouting.
Middle of the second lap, Broxton is already half a lap ahead of Godolphin.
Do we win something for fourth place?
I'm afraid not.
You see those little old ladies up there?
Well, I'm gonna let those little old ladies get tossed right out on their ear.
- How's that for a principle?
- Well...
Beginning the third lap,
Broxton is in first place... followed in order by Tidewater,
State and Godolphin.
Who says you can't win 'em all?
Come on. Let's get out of this folk festival.
Look at Silky and his boys.
All they wanna do is squeeze every loose nickel out of this county.
Well, just because I have a chance to cut their water off doesn't mean...
I have to get mixed up in it, does it?
Well, don't just sit there now, you coldhearted creep!
Yes, you! Get up!
Do something!
Oh, don't give me that!
I know you can hear me!
What are you going to do about them?
Your own kith and kin! So, Bob, you gonna let 'em get pushed around because of my principles?
Don't you have any pride?
Come on! You started it.
Finish it.
Come on! Move it!
Someday I'm gonna strangle him.
Come on! Hurry!
- Pour it on!
- Hurry up!
Come on! Come on!
Let's go!
As we approach the last lap,
Dewey of Broxton is well in the lead.
He passes the baton to...
No, he didn't.
He still has it.
The Broxton anchor man is running the last lap... with a hot dog?
Tidewater makes their pass.
State makes their pass, and...
I believe, yes... the State anchor man seems to have a bottle of...
The Godolphin man, who was half a lap behind, approaches the passing zone.
Come on, Godolphin!
- Come on!
- Ahoy, there!
A perfect change! Friends,
Gudger Larkin of Godolphin... is the only one of the four anchor men to have completed a clean pass.
Now he streaks past the other contestants... who are on their way back to retrieve their batons!
We seem to have a slight hang-up in the passing zone.
Dewey of State has got a hold of
Broxton's baton. Let's check that.
No, it's the hot dog.
Carver of Broxton... a real head's-up performer, has got a hold of two batons.
No! One is snatched away by Wilson of Tidewater!
Come on, Broxton, stop foolin' around!
Gudger Larkin has taken advantage of the rhubarb... and has forged almost a third of a lap ahead of the field.
Catch 'em! Catch 'em!
- Come on!
- Gudger Larkin of Godolphin is still in front... but he's beginning to run out of gas and the others are hot on his heels!
Stop him! Stop him!
Not that, you meathead!
Go, Godolphin, go!
Get up. Get up!
Get up, Gudger!
Get up!
A one-of-a-kind relay team.
Get away from me, you old bats!
We-We won! We won all 45,000 lovely smackeroos! We won!
Technically, maybe we won, but actually...
- You did it, boy! You did it!
Brilliant work!
- Sir, I think when you hear what I have to say...
Say? What is there to say?
The scoreboard says it all!
We thank you, we thank you, we thank you, we thank you!
No rough stuff, old ladies.
You be nice to him.
- Miss Stowecroft?
- Oh, Professor, we're so happy.
Mr Ainsworth from the bank is coming over, and you can give him the money.
And at the stroke of midnight, we'd like Mr Walker to have the honour of burning the mortgage.
- He's done so much for us.
- Well, where is Mr Walker, who's done so much for us?
Well, I believe he's up in his room.
- Is anything wrong?
- Excuse me.
But why go now?
I mean, the lads have triumphed.
The wager's won.
Your wench is happy.
There's enough money set aside for the old ladies.
I fail to divine your reason for leaving.
- Well, don't strain your brain.
- Furthermore, when the mortgage... is consigned to the flames tonight, there is a very good chance... the horrible curse may be lifted off my good self... in which case you may be able to settle down to a serene... albeit somewhat dull... life without me.
Look, frizzface, you think I can stay around here... after what happened out there tonight?
What am I supposed to do for an encore?
No, I'm bailing out.
I've got to go somewhere...
I can make a fresh start... honestly, this time.
Very well.
It be no concern of mine.
I just think it may be a little early for you to be striking your colours!
Stri... Come in!
Oh. Hi.
- Where are you going?
- I'm leaving.
After taking my money and-and stirring everything up... you're running off and leaving us in a lurch?
- No, you don't!
- What are you squawking about?
You got it back, didn't you?
No, I didn't.
Silky welshed on the bet.
- He what?
- Well, he...
He just laughed and said he wasn't gonna pay off.
He's throwing Miss Stowecroft and the others out first thing in the morning.
Under normal conditions, if I can remember such a time...
I have a sweet and a loveable nature.
- Well, you-you know what I think?
- If I may proffer a suggestion...
Shut up!
Both of you!
- Both of who?
- I am sick and tired... of people thinking and suggesting and giving me a lot of cheap advice.
What I am gonna do,
I am gonna find that happy hoodlum... and I am gonna wring that money out of his crooked little neck!
- Steve-Steve, you can't, not in your condition.
- What condition?
Well, anyone can see you're hallucinating again.
Steve, you can't fight
Silky and his men.
She's right, son.
This be a job what takes innards.
Innards? Oh, well, you just sit here and contemplate yours.
- I've got a job to do.
- Permission to come with you, sir?
Oh, no, buddy boy.
No more of your big ideas.
- I'm calling the shots this time.
- Proud to serve under you, sir.
You mean that?
My word, sir, is the ultimate warranty.
All right, shipmate, let's go!
- Make ready the boarding party, Captain.
- Thank ye, Admiral.
Cutlass. You might need that.
Uh-huh. What?
Oh, it's on the bed.
Oh, Steve.
You really have flipped.
Beat, two quarters, drummer boy.
Come cheer up, my lads
'Tis to glory we steer
With heads bearing high
We will banish all fear
To honour we call
You are free men, not slaves
- Free men!
- For who are more free than the sons of the waves
Hearts of oak are our ships
Jolly tars are our men
Eyes right!
We'll always be ready
- Steady, boys, steady
- Steady!
- We'll fight and we'll conquer
- We'll conquer!
Again and again
Together now!
- Hearts of oak are our ships
Jolly tars are our men
- Steve!
- We'll always be ready
Steady, boys, steady
- Steve, wait!
I'm not letting you go to that place alone.
Hearts of oak are our ships
Jolly tars are our men
We'll always be ready
Steady, boys, steady
We'll fight and we'll conquer again and again
Once more, lad.
Sing out. Don't mumble!
Come cheer up, my lads
'Tis to glory we steer
With heads bearing high we will banish all fear
- Steve, wait!
- To honour we call
You are free men, not slaves
For who are so free as the sons of the waves
Hearts of oak are our ships
Jolly tars are our men
We'll always be ready
Steady, boys, steady
We'll fight and we'll conquer again and again
- Oh, you again?
- We'd like to see Mr Seymour.
Look, sister, I'm telling you once and for all...
Mr Seymour don't wanna see...
Come on.
I'll be with you in a minute.
Now, what can I do for you?
We're here to collect the money you owe Professor Baker.
The money I owe her?
You gotta be kidding.
Mr Seymour, you're gonna pay every cent of that money, or l...
Or what, Mr Walker?
Or we might have to get tough.
Now, do I get some action, or don't I?
Mr Walker, I have got to admire your style.
I really do.
I'll tell you what.
You know, there's no use beating up a guy who's the town hero tonight.
It's bad for my image.
You know what I mean?
Professor... here's the $900 you put down on the bet.
- Go ahead, take it.
- Oh, no!
You know very well we need the full amount you rightfully owe us.
Professor, let me level with you.
If I pay you back all that loot, then you'll give it to the old ladies... who'll pay back the bank, right?
And bingo, there goes my childhood dream... namely, running one of those class gambling joints... like they have out west.
I'm sorry, no dice.
But I'll tell you what.
We have a very nice roulette wheel here.
Why don't you forget this phony bet?
Take the $900. Go out there and win some money honestly.
I'll guarantee you, sweetie, you'll sleep a lot better tonight.
Mr Seymour, come up with the full amount, or I'm gonna take this place apart.
- Yeah?
- You have exactly 15 seconds... What?
I said, take the money, lad.
Let the wench try her luck.
Let her what?
Suppose she loses?
You sure it'll work?
- Okay. We'll take it.
- What? We most certainly will not take it!
Mr Seymour has made a very meritorious suggestion.
You know, Mr Walker,
I do not understand you.
One minute, you are a-a-a knight in shining armour.
- And the next minute, you are a...
- Well, we all make mistakes, right, Mr Seymour?
Mr Walker, it's a smart man who knows when to crawfish.
Come along. I'll show you to a nice, quiet room... reserved for our more valued-type customers.
- But I don't know how to gamble.
- This is a good place to learn.
Harry, these are friends of mine.
Take good care of them, will ya?
- Okay, Mr Seymour.
- Good luck, folks.
- Uh, $900 worth, please.
- Yes, sir.
Now, don't worry about a thing.
Just let me handle this.
I'll take the chips, please.
Yellows are a dollar... the reds are five... the blues are 25, the whites 100.
- Don't you have any 50-cent chips?
- Not in this room, lady.
- Make your bets, please.
- It's 28 minutes to midnight.
Now hurry up.
- Oh! Oh, 29 is a good number.
- No, no, no, no. Bet 'em all.
- We don't have time to fool around.
- Mr Walker, are you trying to lose my $900 from me again?
No more bets, please.
The number is 31.
Oh, that's not my numb...
- Oh, how nice.
- Make your bets, please.
Ride, ride. Let it ride.
Let the whole thing ride.
- Oh.
- No, no.
You can't win that way.
Put it on one number.
Would you please just let me do it my way?
No more bets, please.
Number 32. And we ha...
And we have $36 on number 32?
- I won! I won! I told you
I had a talent for this.
- Okay, okay.
- Pay me! Pay me!
- 35 times 36...
Evening, folks.
- What goes on here?
- You tell me.
We're doing fine. We're doing just great. Now let's see.
- Let's put 'em all on...
- No, no. Don't tell me! Let me do it!
- No, let me try one!
- Steve, have you ever played this game before?
- No, but I can tell ya...
Then leave my chips alone, because I have a system.
- A system? What system?
- Woman's intuition. That's what.
- Will you put 'em all on one number.
- No! Steve!
- All right?
Don't you understand?
Time's running out.
Spin the wheel, please.
Watch the board. Whatever happens, watch those chips on the board.
One more like that and we're home.
35 times 36...
Well, now we let it ride.
- Don't fool with it any more.
Go to the gaff.
- Gotcha.
- Would you spin the wheel, please?
- Yes, ma'am.
Everything rides on number 20.
Oh! Oh!
Oh, we did it! We did it!
- What?
- Number 15.
So very sorry, ma'am.
You know what I think?
I think this is a stupid game.
I don't understand.
Something must have gone wrong.
I'll say something went wrong.
We lost almost everything.
All right. Don't panic.
Relax, relax.
We've still got half of the chips we won the first time.
Scurvy cheat.
Look, put 'em all down.
Put all the chips down.
If we put all the chips we've got left onto one number... and it comes up...
- Yeah. We're still in business.
- Make your bets, please.
- The only question is...
- The only question is, what if it doesn't come up?
Don't worry.
Everything is go, all on 11.
- Steve, that's all we have!
- No more bets, please.
Everything goes on 11.
Relax.
We did it! We did it!
- We won! We won!
- Yeah, we did great.
Now, come on. We got enough.
Enough? Enough? What? Are you out of your mind? We're on a winning streak!
Think of those dear old ladies!
Think of what we could buy them.
We could buy them warm coats and cars and polo ponies.
Are you kidding? We gotta get out of here. We barely have time to make it.
- Hey, pay up, will you?
- Wait. Let me place one-one more.
- Pay up. We're in a very big hurry.
- A small bet. $ 100? Maybe 20... 25?
- Hey, fella. Hey.
- A dollar. A dollar.
Pay up, yes.
- That's enough.
- We thank you, the Daughters of the
Buccaneers thank you, and good night.
- Enough?
- Let's go.
- There's still more. Maybe we should take it for good luck.
Not yet.
I just put down a new carpet.
- I hear you've done very well.
- Not bad.
May I see?
Please.
My, my.
That's very nice, indeed.
I'm very happy for you.
See? You made out all right.
You took Silky's advice, right?
Now, why don't you take Silky's advice again and let me keep this for you?
- No, you don't.
- You know, this is an awful lot of bread... for you to be carrying around here, honey.
This is a very dangerous neighbourhood.
Okay, Professor, give me the bag.
I've been very patient with both of you and very civilized.
Okay, boys.
Go on over there, Jo Anne.
Go on.
Make with the muscle.
All right, boys, make your play.
Missed me.
What's the matter with you?
Get up and get him!
And now for Mr Seymour.
- Steve!
- Get his guns!
Get-Get the gun!
- Steve!
- Shoot him! Shoot him!
- I shot him.
- Don't point that thing over here!
- All ashore what's going ashore!
- Come on!
Steve!
Oh, quite nice, lad, yes.
- There's a boat down here. Come on.
- Proceed, lad. I'll just tidy up bit.
Have fun.
Help! Help!
Come on. Stop fooling around!
Get him any way you can!
Got any idea who we're fighting?
It ain't "who' I'm worried about, it's "what."
Are we winning, Mr Seymour?
- Who-Who's that?
- It's me, stupid.
- It's around here someplace.
- Yeah, well, if you think that thing scares me...
Stop 'em! Stop...
Can't you give us just a little more time?
I'm very sorry, ladies, but I'm always precise in these matters.
According to the terms of this document... unless you produce the required payment at midnight of this date... which is just
11 seconds from now...
Eight, seven... six...
Thank you, Mr Ainsworth.
It's a pleasure to do business with you.
Mr Walker, this is the moment that most of us... have been waiting for all our lives.
Will you burn the mortgage?
Miss Stowecroft, thank you very much, but that honour's not for me. L...
Knock their heads together
Here comes the fella you really should thank.
A green-eyed maiden too
And a green-eyed maiden too
Knock them in the head and drop them in the river
With a green-eyed maiden and a...
Oh, no, she said
Oh, yes, I said
Oh, no, you don't again
She said
Hello, old buddy.
I'm glad to see you.
Ladies, all of you repeat after me, please. You too.
Allow me to present your real benefactor.
Captain Blackbeard!
My respects, ma'am.
Good ladies, your welcome has touched me deeply.
Loathe as I am to play the gallant...
I am bound to say... that I've never beheld a concourse of fair creatures... which has stirred me more.
Oh, yes. Thank ye for your esteem.
Thank ye.
And yet you cannot know what it has been like for a person of my disposition... to have been still of tongue, to have had no one to talk to... for 200 accursed and dusty years.
Yet now, my voice is heard once again.
Oh, I do thank you.
Yet stay.
It is not my wish... as a person... as generous as my good self... to seek to take the lion's share of the glory.
No, no.
Oh, no.
This young... rooster, my good friend... he played a modest part... in your delivery from disaster.
- Well, I'd only...
- Not now, son.
Our heart is too full to hear more.
Now, if I might have that vile document.
Aldetha... the time is here.
I go now... to a distant... and I hope, hospitable shore.
I beg of you... take notice of this.
I, Edward Teach, captain... affectionately known... as Blackbeard... was not all bad.
Look after this boy.
He needs help.
Fare thee well, lad.
- Good-bye, Captain.
- We will not meet again.
Beware all wenches.
For he's a jolly good fellow
He's a jolly good fellow
He's a jolly good fellow
And so say all of us
Share this one amongst you, me beauties.
You know something? I think
I'm gonna miss the old scoundrel.
You know something?
I loved you even when
I thought you were nuts.
Look!
- Captain, proud to see you again, sir.
- Where have you been?
You're a sight for sore eyes, you are, sir. Where are we off to now?
Now, you lazy swabs, stir yourselves!
Lift anchor.
Shake out the main.
Lively now, or I'll carve your gizzard... and fry it for me supper!

- Reverend Mother.
- Sister Bernice.
- I simply cannot find her.
- Maria?
She's missing from the abbey again.
Perhaps we should have put a cowbell around her neck.
Have you tried the barn?
You know how much she adores the animals.
I have looked everywhere, in all of the usual places.
Sister Bernice, considering that it's Maria...
I suggest you look in someplace unusual.
Well, Reverend Mother, I hope this new infraction... ends whatever doubts you may still have about Maria's future here.
I always try to keep faith in my doubts, Sister Berthe.
After all, the wool of a black sheep is just as warm.
We are not talking about sheep, black or white, Sister Margaretta.
Of all the candidates for the novitiate...
- I would say Maria is the least likely-
- Children, children!
We were speculating about the qualifications of some of our postulants.
The mistress of novices and the mistress of postulants... were trying to help me by expressing opposite points of view.
Tell me, Sister Catherine, what do you think of Maria?
She's a wonderful girl, some of the time.
Sister Agatha?
It’s very easy to like Maria... except when it's difficult.

You may go in now, Maria.
Come here, my child.
- Now, sit down.
- Oh!
Oh, Reverend Mother, I'm so sorry.
I just couldn't help myself.
The gates were open, and the hills were beckoning, and before I-
Dear, I haven't summoned you here for apologies.
Oh, please, Mother, do let me ask for forgiveness.
If it would make you feel better.
Yes. Well, you see, the sky was so blue today... and everything was so green and fragrant.
I just had to be a part of it.
And the Untersberg kept leading me higher and higher... as though it wanted me to go right through the clouds with it.
Child, suppose darkness had come and you were lost?
Oh, Mother, I could never be lost up there.
That's my mountain. I was brought up on it.
It was the mountain that led me to you.
Oh?
When I was a child,
I would come down the mountain... and climb a tree and look over into your garden.
I'd see the sisters at work, and I'd hear them sing on their way to vespers... which brings me to another transgression,
Reverend Mother.
I was singing out there today without permission.
Maria, it is only here in the abbey that we have rules about postulants singing.
I can't seem to stop singing wherever I am.
And what's worse, I can't seem to stop saying things- everything and anything I think and feel.
Some people would call that honesty.
But it's terrible, Reverend Mother.
You know how Sister Berthe always makes me kiss the floor after we've had a disagreement?
Lately I've taken to kissing the floor when I see her coming just to save time.
Maria, when you saw us over the abbey wall... and longed to be one of us... that didn't necessarily mean... that you were prepared for the way we live here, did it?
No, Mother, but I- I pray, and I try... and I am learning, I really am.
What is the most important lesson you have learned here, my child?
To find out what is the will of God and to do it wholeheartedly.
Maria.
It seems to be the will of God that you leave us.
- Leave?
- Only for a while, Maria.
Oh, no, Mother, please don't do that.
Don't send me away.
This is where I belong. It’s my home, my family.
It’s my life.
- But are you truly ready for it?
- Yes, I am.
Perhaps if you go out into the world for a time... knowing what we expect of you... you will have a chance to find out if you can expect it of yourself.
I know what you expect, Mother, and I can do it.
- I promise I can.
- Maria.
Yes, Mother.
If it is God's will.
There is a family near Salzburg... that needs a governess until September.
- Until September?
- To take care of seven children.
- Seven children!
- Do you like children, Maria?
Well, yes, but seven!
I will tell Captain von Trapp to expect you tomorrow.
Uh, Captain?
A retired officer of the Imperial Navy.
A fine man and a brave one.
Ηis wife died several years ago, leaving him alone with the children.
I understand he's had a most difficult time... managing to keep a governess there.
Uh, why difficult, Reverend Mother?
The Lord will show you in his own good time.

Oh! Whew!
Ηello! Ηere I am.
I'm from the convent. I'm the new governess, Captain.
And I'm the old butler, fraülein.
Oh. Well, how do you do?
Ηmm.
You'll, uh, wait here, please.
[ Door Opens ]
In the future, you'll kindly remember... there are certain rooms in this house which are not to be disturbed.
Yes, Captain, sir.
And why do you stare at me that way?
Well, you don't look at all like a sea captain, sir.
I'm afraid you don't look very much like a governess.
- Turn around, please.
- What?
Turn.
Ηat off.
[ Sighs ]
It’s the dress.
You'll have to put on another one before you meet the children.
But I don't have another one.
When we enter the abbey, our worldly clothes were given to the poor.
What about this one?
- The poor didn't want this one.
- Hmm.
I would have made myself a new dress, but there wasn't time.
I can make my own clothes.
Well, I'll see that you get some material.
Today, if possible.
- Now, Fraülein, um-
- Maria.
Fraülein Maria, I don't know how much the mother abbess has told you.
- Not much.
- You are the 12th in a long line of governesses... who have come to look after my children since their mother died.
I trust that you will be an improvement on the last one. She stayed only two hours.
What's wrong with the children, sir?
There's nothing wrong with the children, only the governesses.
Oh.
They were completely unable to maintain discipline.
Without it, this house cannot be properly run.
- You will please remember that, fraülein?
- Yes, sir.
Every morning you will drill the children in their studies.
I will not permit them to dream away their summer holidays.
Each afternoon they will march about the grounds, breathing deeply.
Bedtime is to be strictly observed, no exceptions.
Excuse me, sir. When do they play?
You will see to it that they conduct themselves at all time... with the utmost orderliness and decorum.
- I'm placing you in command.
- Oh, yes, sir!

Fraülein, this is a large house.
The grounds are very extensive, and I will not have anyone shouting.
You will take this, please.
Learn to use it. The children will help you.
Now, when I want you, this is what you will hear.
- [ Sharp Whistling ]
- No, sir. I'm sorry, sir.
I could never answer to a whistle.
Whistles are for dogs and cats and other animals, but not for children... and definitely not for me.
It would be too humiliating.
Fraülein... were you this much trouble at the abbey?
- Oh, much more, sir.
- Hmm.

Excuse me, sir. I don't know your signal.
You may call me Captain.
[ Children Chuckling ]
[ Sighs ]

Well, now that there's just us... would you please tell me all your names again and how old you are?
I'm Liesl. I'm 16 years old, and I don't need a governess.
I'm glad you told me, Liesl.
We'll just be good friends.
I'm Friedrich. I'm 14. I'm impossible.
[ Chuckles ]
Really? Who told you that, Friedrich?
Fraülein Josephine, four governesses ago.
I'm Brigitta.
You, um, didn't tell me how old you are, Louisa.
I'm Brigitta. She's Louisa.
She's 13 years old, and you're smart.
I'm 10, and I think your dress is the ugliest one I ever saw.
Brigitta, you shouldn't say that.
Why not? Don't you think it's ugly?
Of course, but Fraülein Hilda's was ugliest.
I'm Kurt. I'm 11. I'm incorrigible.
Congratulations.
What's "incorrigible"?
I think it means you want to be treated like a boy.
Mm-hmm?
I'm Marta, and I'm gonna be seven on Tuesday.
And I'd like a pink parasol.
Well, pink's my favorite color too.
- [ Stomping ]
- Yes, you're Gretl.
And you're five years old?
My, you're practically a lady.
[ Girls Chuckle ]
Now I have to tell you a secret-
I've never been a governess before.
You mean you don't know anything about being a governess?
Nothing. I'll need lots of advice.
Well, the best way to start... is to be sure to tell Father to mind his own business.
- You must never come to dinner on time.
- Uh-
- Never eat your soup quietly.
- [ Slurps ]
And during dessert, always blow your nose.
Don't you believe a word they say, Fraülein Maria.
- Why not?
- Because I like you!
- Yes.
- [ Clapping ]
All right now, children!
Outside for your walk. Father's orders.
Now, hurry up, hurry up.
Quick, quick, quick, quick, quick!
- Uh, Fraülein Maria.
- Mmm.
- I'm Frau Schmidt, the housekeeper.
- How do you do?
How do you do? I'll show you to your room. Follow me.

Excuse me, Captain.
Haven't we forgotten to thank the Lord?
For what we are about to receive, may the Lord make us truly thankful. Amen.
- Amen.
- [ Children ] Amen.
I'd like to thank each and every one of you for the precious gift... you left in my pocket earlier today.
Um, what gift?
It’s meant to be a secret, Captain, between the children and me.
Uh-huh. Then I suggest that you keep it and let us eat.
Knowing how nervous I must have been... a stranger in a new household... knowing how important it was for me to feel accepted... it was so kind and thoughtful of you... to make my first moments here so warm... and happy and pleasant.
[ Cries ]
- What is the matter, Marta?
- Nothing.
[ Children Crying ]
[ Von Trapp ]

Is it to be at every meal, or merely at dinnertime... that you intend leading us all through this rare... and wonderful new world of indigestion?
Oh, they're all right, Captain. They're just happy.

- Rolfe, good evening.
- Good evening, Franz.
- I trust everything is under control?
- Yes. Yes.

- Are there, uh, any developments?

- He's at dinner.
- With the family?
- Yes.
Please give him this telegram at once.

- A telegram for you, sir.
- Mmm.

That young lad Rolfe, of course.
- Father, may I be excused?
- Hmm. Children.

Not again, Father!
How long will you be gone this time, Father?

Why would she want to see you?
It just so happens, Marta, that you are going to see the baroness.
I'm bringing her back with me to visit us all.
[ Children ]
Good!
And Uncle Max.
- Uncle Max!
- Uncle Max!
Rolfe!
Oh, Rolfe.
- No, Liesl, we mustn't.
- Why not, silly?
- I don't know. It’s just-
- Isn’t this why you're here waiting for me?
Yes, of course. I've missed you, Liesl.
You have? How much?
So much that I even thought of sending you a telegram... just so I'd be able to deliver it here.
Oh, that's a lovely thought. Why don't you, right now?
But I'm here.
Please, Rolfe, send me a telegram.
I'll start it for you. Dear Liesl-
Dear Liesl.
I'd like to be able to tell you how I feel about you. Stop.
Unfortunately, this wire is already too expensive.
- Sincerely, Rolfe.
- "Sincerely"?
- Cordially.
- "Cordially"?
Affectionately?
Mmm!
Will there be any reply?
Dear Rolfe. Stop.
Don't stop. Your Liesl.
If only we didn't always have to wait... for someone to send Father a telegram.
Ηow do I know when I'll see you again?
Well, let's see.
I could come here by mistake... with a telegram for Colonel Schneider.
He's here from Berlin, staying with-
No one's supposed to know he's here.
- Don't tell your father, now.
- Why not?
- Well, your father's so- so Austrian.
- We're all Austrian.
Well, some people think we ought to be German... and they're very mad at those who don't think so.
They're getting ready to-
Well, let's hope your father doesn't get into trouble.
Don't worry about Father. He's a big naval hero.
- He was even decorated by the emperor.
- I know.
I don't worry about him, but I do worry about his daughter.
Me? Why?
- Well, you're so-
- What?
You're such a baby!
I'm 16. What's such a baby about that?

[ Thunder Rumbling ]
Whee!
[ Thunderclaps ]
- [ Knocking ]
- Come in.
Frau Schmidt.
For your new dresses, Fraülein Maria.
The captain had these sent out from town.
Oh, how lovely.
I'm sure these will make the prettiest clothes I've ever had.
Tell me, do you think the captain would get me some more material if I asked him?
- Ηow many dresses does a governess need?
- [ Window Bangs ]
No, not for me. For the children.
I want to make them some play clothes.
The von Trapp children don't play. They march.
Surely, you don't approve of that.
Ever since the captain lost his poor wife... he- he runs this house as if he were on one of his ships again.
Whistles, orders.
No more music, no more laughing.
Nothing that reminds him of her.
- Even the children.
- But it's so wrong!
Oh, well. How do you like your room?
- There'll be new drapes at the windows.
- Mmm.
New drapes? But these are fine.
Nevertheless, new ones have been ordered.
Oh, but I really don't need them.
- Good night now.
- Frau Schmidt.
Do you think if I asked the captain tomorrow about the material-
He's leaving for Vienna in the morning.
Oh, yes, of course. Well, how long will he be gone?
That all depends.
The last time he visited the baroness, he stayed for a month.
Oh.
I shouldn't be saying this- not to you.
I mean, I don't know you that well.
But if you ask me, the captain's thinking very seriously... of marrying the woman before the summer's over.
Oh, that would be wonderful.
The children will have a mother again.
Yes. Well, good night.
- Good night.
- [ Thunder Rumbling ]
[ Thunderclap, Rain Falling ]
Dear Father, now I know why you've sent me here.
To help these children prepare themselves for a new mother.
And I pray that this will become a happy family in thy sight.
God bless the captain. God bless Liesl and Friedrich.
God bless Louisa, Brigitta, Marta and little Gretl.
And, oh, I forgot the other boy. What's his name?
Well, God bless what's-his-name.
God bless the reverend mother and Sister Margaretta... and everybody at Nonnberg Abbey.
And now, dear God, about Liesl-
Ηelp her to know that I'm her friend.
And help her to tell me what she's been up to.
- Are you going to tell on me?
- Shh.
Ηelp me to be understanding so that I may guide her footsteps.
In the name of the Father and of the Son and the Holy Ghost. Amen.
I was out taking a walk, and somebody locked the doors earlier than usual... and I didn't want to wake everybody up.
So when I saw your window open-
You're not going to tell Father, are you?
Ηmm.
Ηow in the world did you climb up here?
It’s how we always got into this room to play tricks on the governess.
Louisa can make it with a whole jar of spiders in her hand.
Spiders?
Oh. Liesl.
Were you out walking all by yourself?
You know, if we wash that dress out tonight, nobody would notice it tomorrow.
You could put this on.
Take your dress in there.
Put it to soak in the bathtub.
Then come back here and sit on the bed, and we'll have a talk.
I told you today I didn't need a governess.
Well, maybe I do.
[ Thunderclap ]
Gretl? Are you scared?
[ Thunderclap ]
You're not frightened of a thunderstorm, are you?
You just stay right here with me. Oh!
- Where are the others?
- They're asleep. They're not scared.
[ Thunderclap ]
Oh, no? Look.
All right, everybody. Up here on the bed.
- [ Brigitta ] Really?
- Well, just this once. Come on.
Now, all we have to do is wait for the boys.
You won't see them. Boys are brave.
[ Thunderclap ]
Uh, you boys weren't scared too, were you?
Oh, no. We just wanted to be sure that you weren't.
- That's very thoughtful of you, Friedrich.
- It wasn't my idea.
It was Kurt's.
Kurt! That's the one I left out. God bless Kurt.
[ Thunderclap ]
Why does it do that?
Well, the lightning says something to the thunder, and the thunder answers back.
- The lightning must be nasty.
- Not really.
Then why does the thunder get so angry?
It makes me want to cry.
[ Thunderclap ]
Well, now, when anything bothers me and I'm feeling unhappy...
I just try and think of nice things.
[ Louisa, Marta ]
What kind of things?
Oh! Well, let me see. Nice things-
Daffodils!
Green meadows.
Skies full of stars.

Fraülein, did I not tell you that bedtime is to be strictly observed in this house?
The children were upset by the storm, so I thought that if I-
You did, sir.
And do you or do you not have difficulty remembering such simple instructions?
Only during thunderstorms, sir.
- [ Kurt Giggles ]

- Yes, Father?
- I don't recall seeing you anywhere after dinner.
Oh, really? Well, as a matter of fact-
Yes?
Well, I- I was-
What she would like to say, Captain, is that she and I... have been getting better acquainted tonight.
But it's much too late now to go into all that.
Come along, children, you heard your father.
Go back to bed immediately.
Fraülein, you have managed to remember that I'm leaving in the morning?
Is it also possible that you remember... that the first rule in this house is discipline?
Then I trust that before I return, you will have acquired some?
Captain.
Uh, I wonder if, before you go...
I could talk to you about some clothes for the children, for when they play.
- Fraülein Maria.
- If I could just have some material-
You are obviously many things, not the least of which is repetitious.
- But they're children!

I can't understand how children as nice as you... can manage to play such awful tricks on people.
- [ Brigitta ] Oh, it's easy.
- But why do it?
- How else can we get Father's attention?
- Yes.
Oh, I see.
Well, we'll have to think about that one.
[ Maria Claps ]
All right, everybody! Over here!
[ Marta ]
What are we going to do?
Let's think of something to sing for the baroness when she comes.

Father doesn't like us to sing.
Well, perhaps we can change his mind.

Unless the jokes improve, Max,
I'm taking back my invitation.
You didn't invite me to your villa. I invited myself.
Naturally.
You needed a chaperone, and I needed a place to stay where the cuisine is superb... the wine cellar unexcelled and the price, uh, perfect.

That is not what I mean, and you know it.
Ah, you mean me. I'm exciting.
- Is that so impossible?
- No, just, uh, highly improbable.
- There you go, running yourself down again.
- Well, I'm a dangerous driver.
[ Laughs ]
You know, you're much less of a riddle when I see you here, Georg.
- In my natural habitat?
- Yes, exactly.
Are you trying to say that I'm more at home here... among the birds and the flowers... and the wind that moves through the trees like a restless sea, hmm?
Ηow poetic.
Yes, it was rather, wasn't it?
More at home here than in Vienna... in all your glittering salons... gossiping gaily with bores I detest, soaking myself in champagne... stumbling about to waltzes by Strauss
I can't even remember.
- Is that what you're trying to say?
- More or less, yes.
Now, whatever gave you that idea?
[ Sighs ]
Oh, I do like it here, Georg.
It’s so lovely and peaceful.
Ηow can you leave it as often as you do?
Oh, pretending to be madly active, I suppose.
Activity suggests a life filled with purpose.
Could it be running away from memories?
Mm-hmm.
Or perhaps just searching for a reason to stay.
Oh, I hope that's why you've been coming to Vienna so often.
Or were there other distractions there?
Oh, I'd hardly call you a mere distraction, darling.
Well, what would you call me, Georg?
Ηmm. Lovely.
Charming, witty, graceful. The perfect hostess.
And, uh- Υou're gonna hate me for this- in a way, my savior.
Oh, how unromantic.
I would be an ungrateful wretch if I didn't tell you at least once... that it was you who brought some meaning back into my life.
Oh, I am amusing, I suppose.
And I do have the finest couturier in Vienna... and the most glittering circle of friends.
- And I do give some rather gay parties.
- [ Laughs ] Yes.
But take all that away, and you have just... wealthy, unattached little me searching just like you.

- What happened, darling?
- Yesterday, Sascha Petrie stole them first.
If there's one thing I hate, it's a thief.
Max, you really must try and learn to love yourself.
For this, I had to call Paris, Rome and Stockholm.
- On Georg's telephone, of course?
- How else could I afford it?
Oh, dear, I like rich people.
I like the way they live.
I like the way I live when I'm with them.
I wonder where the children are.
Obviously they must have heard
I was coming and went into hiding.
I was hoping they'd be here to welcome you.
Uh, Max, do step out of character for a moment and try and be charming.

Well what?
Have you made up Georg's mind yet?
Do I hear wedding bells?
- Pealing madly.
- Marvelous.
- But not necessarily for me.
- What kind of talk's that?
That is none-of-your-business talk, Max.
I'm terribly fond of Georg, and I will not have you toying with us.
But I'm a child. I like toys.
So tell me everything.
Oh, come on, tell Max every teensy weensy... intimate, disgusting detail.
Well, let's just say I have a feeling
I may be here on approval.
- Well, I approve of that. How can you miss?
- Far too easily.
If I know you, darling, and I do, you will find a way.
- Oh, he's no ordinary man.
- No. He's rich.
When his wife died, she left him with a terrible heartache.
And when your husband died, he left you with a terrible fortune.
Oh, Max, you really are a beast.
You and Georg are like family to me.
That's why I want to see you two get married.
We must keep all that lovely money in the family.

Oh, Georg, he's just a boy.
Yes, and I'm just an Austrian.
What's gonna happen's going to happen.
Just make sure it doesn't happen to you.

You know I have no political convictions.
Can I help it if other people do?
Oh, yes, you can help it! You must help it.

Is there any way I could bring you back to the world I'm in?

Ηave my children, by any chance, been climbing trees today?
- Yes, Captain.
- I see.
And where, may I ask, did they get these-
- Play clothes.
- Is that what you call them?
I made them from the drapes that used to hang in my bedroom.
- Drapes?
- They still had plenty of wear left.

- Mm-hmm, and having a marvelous time.
- They have uniforms.
- Straitjackets, if you'll forgive me.

Children cannot do the things they're supposed to do... if they have to worry about spoiling their precious clothes.
- I haven't heard them complain yet.
- They wouldn't dare.

Don't you dare tell me about my son.
Brigitta could tell you about him, if you'd let her get close to you.

Kurt pretends he's tough not to show how hurt he is when you brush him aside.
- That will do.
- The way you do all of them.
- Louisa, I don't know about, but someone has to find out.
- I said that will do!
And the little ones just want to be loved.
Oh, please, love them, love them all.
I don't care to hear anything further from you about my children!

You were right.
I don't know my children.
There's still time, Captain.
They want so much to be close to you.
You brought music back into the house.
I'd forgotten.
Fraülein.
I want you to stay.
I ask you to stay.
If I could be of any help-
You have already. More than you know.

- [ Max ] Bravo! Bravo!
- Bravo!
[ Von Trapp ]
Wonderful.
- Can we really keep the puppet show, Uncle Max?
- Yes, may we, Uncle Max?
Of course you may, my darlings.
Why else would I have told Professor Kohner to send the bill to your father?
- [ Excited Chattering ]
- May we really keep them?
- [ Maria ] Whew!
- Well done, fraülein.

I really am very, very much impressed.
They're your children, Captain.
My dear, is there anything you can't do?
- Well, I'm not sure I'll make a very good nun.

If you have any problems, I'd be happy to help you.
[ Max ]
Attention! Attention, everyone.
I have an announcement to make. Surprise, surprise.
Today, after a long and desperate search...
I have finally found a most exciting entry for the Salzburg Folk Festival.
Congratulations, Max.
Who will you be exploiting this time?
Ηa-ha!
- The St. Ignatius Choir?
- Guess again.
Uh, let me see now. The, um-
- The Klopmann Choir?
- No, no, no, no, no.
- No, no?
- No, no.
- Oh.
- [ Liesl ] Tell us.
A singing group all in one family.
You'll never guess, Georg.
What a charming idea. Uh, whose family?
- [ Laughs ] Yours.
- Oh.
- Ah!
- They'll be the talk of the festival.
Ηmm.
- [ Laughs ]
- What's so funny?
You are, Max. You're expensive, but very funny.
- But you heard them. They'll be a sensation!
- No, Max.
- [ Children Groaning ]
- It’s a wonderful idea. Fresh, original.
Max, my children do not sing in public.
Well, you can't blame me for trying.
Children, who shall we hear from next?
- [ Maria ] Who?
- [ Children ] Yes.
- [ Softly ] Are you-
- Yes.
[ Clears Throat ]
The vote is unanimous.
You, Captain.
Me? I don't understand.
Please.
Ah. Huh, huh, huh, huh.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
I'm told that a long time ago you were quite good.
Well, that was a very, very, very long time ago.
- I remember, Father.
- Play us something we know.
- Oh, please, Father.
- Please.
Well.
- Why didn't you tell me?
- What?

- The Von Trapp Family Singers.
I have a wonderful idea, Georg.
Let's really fill this house with music.
You must give a grand and glorious party for me while I'm here.
- A party?
- [ Children ] Please, Father! Please!
I think it's high time I met all your friends here in Salzburg and they met me.
- Don't you agree?
- I see what you mean.
- [ Children ] Oh, please, Father!
- It’s time to go to bed.
Come, now, say good night.
- [ Louisa ] Good night, Father.
- [ Gretl ] Good night, Father.
- [ Baroness ] Good night.
- [ Von Trapp ] Good night.
Good night, Baroness Schraeder. Good night, Father.

Good night, Uncle Max.
It'll be my first party, Father!
- Captain.
- Evening, Herr Zeller.
Baroness Schraeder. Ηerr Zeller.
- Good evening, Ηerr Zeller.
- Baroness.
- How do you do?
- Baroness Schraeder.
Good evening.
I suppose you noticed the obvious display of the Austrian flag in the hallway?
- The women look so beautiful.
- I think they look ugly.
You just say that because you're scared of them.
Silly, only grown-up men are scared of women.
I think the men look beautiful.
Ηow would you know?
- Liesl, who are you dancing with?
- Nobody.
[ Brigitta ]
Oh, yes, you are.
- May I have this dance?
- I'd be delighted, young man.
Why didn't you children tell me you could dance?
We were afraid you'd make us all dance together.
The Von Trapp Family Dancers.
♪♪ [ Orchestra: Waltz ]
[ Gretl ]
What's that they're playing?
It’s the ländler. It’s an Austrian folk dance.
- Show me.
- Kurt, I haven't danced that since I was a little girl.
Oh, you remember. Please?
- Well-
- Please.
All right. Come on over here.
- Now you bow, and I curtsy.
- Like this?
Fine. Now we go for a little walk. This way.
One, two, three. One, two, three.
One, two, three. Step together.
Now, step, hop. Step, hop.
Now, turn under.
Not quite. This way. Ηop, step, hop.
And under.
- Kurt, we'll have to practice.
- Um, do allow me, will you?
[ Kurt ]
Mm-hmm.
I don't remember any more.
- Your face is all red.
- Is it?
I don't suppose I'm used to dancing.
[ Applause ]
That was beautifully done.
What a lovely couple you make.
Yes. I think it's time the children said good night.
Yes, we'll be in the hall in a moment.
We've got something very special prepared.
- Right?
- [ Brigitta ] Right.
[ Maria ]
Come on!
All that needless worrying, Georg.
You thought you wouldn't find a friend at the party.
A bit chilly out tonight, isn't it?
Oh, I don't know.
It seemed rather warm to me.

They're extraordinary.
What they would do at the festival!
- Oh, young lady, I must have words with you.
- Congratulations.
Georg, you're not going to let this girl get away.
She has to join the party.
- No, really, I-
- Shh. Stop. Stop it.
- Georg, please.
- You can if you want to, fraülein.
I insist. You will be my dinner partner.
This is business.
Franz, set another place next to mine for Fraülein Maria.
Why- Whatever you say, Herr Detweiler.
It appears to be all arranged, doesn't it?
- It certainly does.
- I'm not suitably dressed.
Uh, well, you can change. We'll wait for you.
All right.
Captain, you must be very proud of your youngsters.
I am. Thank you, Baroness.
Is there a more beautiful expression... of what is good in this country of ours... than the innocent voices of our children?
Oh, come, now, Baron, would you have us believe... that Austria alone holds a monopoly on virtue?
Herr Zeller, some of us prefer
Austrian voices raised in song... to ugly German threats.
The ostrich buries his head in the sand... and sometimes... in the flag.
Perhaps those who would warn you that the Anschluss is coming- and it is coming, Captain- perhaps they would get further with you... by setting their words to music.
If the Nazis take over Austria, I have no doubt that you will be the entire trumpet section.
- You flatter me, Captain.
- Oh, how clumsy of me.
I meant to accuse you.
It’s very kind of you to offer to help me, Baroness.
I'm delighted, Maria.
I really don't think I do have anything that would be appropriate.
Now, where is that lovely little thing... you were wearing the other evening... when the captain couldn't keep his eyes off you?
Couldn't keep his eyes off me?
Come, my dear, we are women.
Let's not pretend we don't know when a man notices us.
- Here we are.
- The captain notices everybody and everything.
There's no need to feel so defensive, Maria.
You are quite attractive, you know.
The captain would hardly be a man if he didn't notice you.
Baroness, I hope you're joking.
- Not at all.
- But I've never done a thing to-
But you don't have to, my dear.
There's nothing more irresistible to a man than a woman who's in love with him.
- In love with him?
- Of course.
But what makes it so nice is he thinks he's in love with you.
But that's not true.
Surely you've noticed the way he looks into your eyes.
And, you know, uh, you blushed in his arms... when you were dancing just now.
Don't take it to heart.
He'll get over it soon enough, I should think.
Men do, you know.
Then I should go.
I mustn't stay here.
- Is there something I can do to help?
- No, nothing.
Yes.
Please don't say a word about this to the captain.
No. No, I wouldn't dream of it.
Good-bye, Maria.
I'm sure you'll make a very fine nun.
Champagne, darling.
I feel like celebrating.
Cheers.
- You know something?
- Perhaps.
Then if you're so clever, tell me how to get our little fraülein... to use her influence with Georg.
I want those children in the festival.
Elsa, this is important to Austria.
It wouldn't do you any harm either.
I've thought of that.
Well, if it's a matter of influence... maybe the one you'll have to be talking to is me.

Oh, I'm sure I did.
She said she missed her life at the abbey too much.
She had to leave us.
And that's all there is to it.
I think I'm brave enough to try some of that.

Wait here.
I'm Sister Margaretta.
I understand you've been inquiring about Maria.
We have to see her.
Will you tell her we're here, please?
I'm afraid I can't do that.
- You've got to. We have to see her.
- She's our governess.
- We want her back!
- [ Kurt ] She didn't even say good-bye.
- It’s very important.
- All we want to do is talk to her.
I'm very sorry, children, but Maria is in seclusion.
She hasn't been seeing anyone.
- She'll see us. I know she will.
- I want to show her my finger.
Oh, some other time, dear.
I'll tell her that you were here.
It was sweet of you to call.
- [ Brigitta ] Oh, we have to speak to her!
- [ Marta ] Please!

- Run along, children. Run along home.
- [ Friedrich ] Sister Margaretta!
- [ Girls ] Please! Please!
- Good-bye, children.
- Please. Please.
What was that about, Sister Margaretta?
The von Trapp children, Reverend Mother.
They want to see Maria.
Has she spoken yet? Has she told you anything?
She doesn't say a word,
Reverend Mother, except in prayer.
Poor child.
It’s strange. She seems happy to be back here... and yet- and yet she's unhappy too.
Perhaps I have been wrong in leaving her alone so long.
I think you'd better bring her to me, even if she's not yet ready.
Yes, Reverend Mother.
Sister Augusta, take our new postulant to the robing room.
God bless you, my daughter.
- [ Knocking ]
- Ave!
Yes, bring her in.
You've been unhappy. I'm sorry.
Reverend Mother.
Why did they send you back to us?
They didn't send me back, Mother. I left.
Sit down, Maria. Tell me what happened.
Well, I- I was frightened.
Frightened? Were they unkind to you?
Oh, no. No, I was- I was confused.
I- I felt-
I've never felt that way before. I couldn't stay.
I knew that here I'd be away from it. I'd be safe.
Maria, our abbey is not to be used as an escape.
What is it you can't face?
- I can't face him again.
- Him?
Thank you, Sister Margaretta.
Captain von Trapp?
- Are you in love with him?
- I don't know!
I don't know, I- The baroness said I was.
She- She said that he was in love with me... but I didn't want to believe it.
Oh, there were times when we would look at each other... oh, Mother, I could hardly breathe.
- Did you let him see how you felt?
- If I did, I didn't know it.
That's what's been torturing me.
I was there on God's errand.
To have asked for his love would have been wrong.
I couldn't stay. I just couldn't!
I'm ready at this moment to take my vows.
Please help me.
Maria, the love of a man and a woman is holy too.
You have a great capacity to love.
What you must find out is how God wants you to spend your love.
But I've pledged my life to God.
I- I've pledged my life to his service.
My daughter, if you love this man, it doesn't mean you love God less.
No.
You must find out.
You must go back.
Mother, you can't ask me to do that.
Please let me stay. I beg of you.
Maria, these walls were not built... to shut out problems.
You have to face them.
You have to live the life you were born to live.

- We ate them!
- You ate them?
- Yes!
- All of them?
- They were delicious!
Very well.
Since you've obviously stuffed yourselves... full of thousands of delicious berries, you can't be hungry anymore... so I'll just have to simply tell Frau Schmidt... to, uh, skip your dinner.
It’s all your fault! We should have told him the truth.
And made him boiling mad at us?

It’s better than starving to death.

May I wish you every happiness, Baroness, and you too, Captain.
The children tell me you're to be married.
Thank you, my dear.
You are back to, uh, stay?
Only until arrangements can be made for another governess.
[ Baroness ]
There you are!
I really must speak to cook about the wiener schnitzel.
It is entirely too delicious for my figure.
And it makes you much too quiet at the dinner table.
- Hmm.
- Or was it the wine?
Oh, undoubtedly the wine.
You have no idea what kind of trouble I'm having... trying to decide what to give you for a wedding present.
Oh, I know, I'm enough, but I do want you to have... some little trifle for the occasion.
At first, I thought of a fountain pen, but you've already got one.
And then I thought perhaps a villa in the south of France... but they are so difficult to gift-wrap.
Georg, how do you feel about yachts?
A long, sleek one for the Mediterranean... or a tiny one for your bathtub, hmm?
- Elsa.
- And where to go on our honeymoon?
Now, that is a real problem.
I thought a trip around the world would be lovely.
Then I said, "Oh, Elsa, there must be someplace better to go."
- Don't worry, darling. I-
- Elsa.
Yes, Georg?
It’s no use... you and I.
I'm being dishonest to both of us... and utterly unfair to you.
- When two people talk of marriage-
- No, don't.
Don't say another word, Georg, please.
You see, um-
There are other things I've been thinking of.
Fond as I am of you...
I really don't think you're the right man for me.
You're, um- You're much too independent.
And I- I need someone who needs me desperately... or at least needs my money desperately.
I've enjoyed every moment we've had together.
I do thank you for that.
Now, if you'll forgive me,
I'll go inside, pack my little bags... and return to Vienna, where I belong.
And somewhere out there is a young lady who I think... will never be a nun.
Auf Wiedersehen, darling.
[ Von Trapp ]
Hello.
I thought I just might find you here.
Was there something you wanted?
Hmm?
No, no, no, no. Sit down. Please.
Please.
Uh, may I?
[ Chuckles ]
You know, I was-
I was thinking and I was wondering two things.
Why did you run away to the abbey?
And... what was it that made you come back?
Well, I had an obligation to fulfill... and I- I came back to fulfill it.
Hmm. Is that all?
And I missed the children.
Yes. Only the children?
No. Yes! Isn’t it right I should have missed them?
Oh, yes! Yes, of course!
I was only hoping that perhaps you-
Perhaps you might, uh-
Yes?
Well, uh-
Nothing was the same when you were away... and it'll be all wrong again after you leave.
And I just thought perhaps you might, uh, change your mind?
I'm sure the baroness will be able to make things fine for you.
Maria.
There isn't going to be any baroness.
There isn't?
No.
I don't understand.
Well, we've, um, called off our engagement, you see, and-
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Yes.
- You are?
- Mm-hmm.
- You did?
- Yes.
Well, you can't marry someone when you're... in love with someone else.
Can you?
[ Maria Sighs ]
The reverend mother always says...
"When the Lord closes a door, somewhere he opens a window."
What else does the reverend mother say?
That you have to look for your life.
Is that why you came back?
And have you found it...
Maria?
I think I have.
I know I have.
I love you.

Herr Detweiler!
- Heil Hitler.
- Oh. Good afternoon, Herr Zeller.
Perhaps you've not heard. I'm now the gauleiter.
- Heil Hitler.
- Uh, heil Hitler.
I have just come from the house of Captain von Trapp... incidentally, the only one in the neighborhood... not flying the flag of the Third Reich since the Anschluss.
- But we have dealt with that situation.
- I don't think-
The housekeeper told me that I would find you here.
It was the only information the woman would give me.
What kind of information are you looking for?
We want to know when the captain will be returning.
Well, he's on his honeymoon trip.
Uh, he's not been in touch with us.
Are you asking me to believe that the captain... has not communicated with his children in over a month?
Herr Zeller, how many men do you know... who communicate with their children while on their honeymoon?
When he does return, he will be expected to fill... his proper position in the new order.
Naturally, naturally. And may I congratulate you- that is, your people- on deciding to allow the festival to go on tonight as planned?
Why should it not go on?
Nothing in Austria has changed.
Singing and music will show this to the world.
Austria is the same.
Ηeil Hitler.
Ηeil Hitler.
[ Sniffs ]
Come on, children, let's go home.
- Why was he so cross?
- Everybody's cross these days, darling.
[ Marta ] Maybe the flag with the black spider on it makes people nervous.
- Is Father going to be in trouble?
- He doesn't have to be.
The thing to do these days is to get along with everybody.
I want you all to remember that tonight at the concert.
Are we really going to sing before a whole lot of people tonight?
Of course. Look, the Von Trapp Family Singers.
And here are your names- Liesl, Friedrich...
Louisa, Brigitta, Kurt, Marta and Gretl.
Why am I always last?
- Because you are the most important.
- Oh!
There we go.
[ Brigitta ] Uncle Max, are you sure Father will approve of our singing in public?
Oh, he'll be pleased and proud.
- Liesl, do you think so?
- Don't you trust me?
- [ Brigitta ] No!
- You're a very intelligent girl.
- [ Chuckles ]
- [ Rolfe ] Liesl! Liesl!
[ Liesl ]
Rolfe!
- Rolfe, I'm so glad to see you. It’s been such-
- Good afternoon.
You will take this, please, and deliver it to your father as soon as he comes home.
- Ηe's on his honeymoon.
- I know that.
- You do?
- We make it our business to know everything about everyone.
- Who's we?
- See that he gets it.
- What is it?
- It’s a telegram from Berlin.
Don't you want to come over tonight and deliver it yourself?
I am now occupied with more important matters... and your father better be, too, if he knows what's good for him.
But, Rolfe-
Father! Father!
- We didn't expect you so soon.
- Hello, hello, hello!
- When did you get back?
- We didn't expect you home until next week.
[ Kurt ]
Did you bring us any souvenirs from Paris?
[ Maria ]
Hello! How are you?
[ Friedrich ]
Why didn't you telephone us?
We tried to, but we couldn't get through.
I had nothing to do with that, Georg.
We came back as fast as we could.
Well, well, well, well, well! We missed you!
We missed kissing you good night.
We missed all the noise you make in the morning telling each other to be quiet.
- Mostly, we missed hearing you sing.
- Oh, you came back just in time.
Look, Fraülein Maria- I mean, Mother.
- We're going to sing in the festival tonight.
- What?
- [ All Chattering ]
- Yes, we've been rehearsing all-
Surprise, surprise!
All right, surprises for you on the terrace.
[ Marta ]
Presents!
We'll talk about this inside.
I would have told you, but you were away.
I had to make a last-minute decision.
- I was fortunate to enter them at all.
- Max.
- They'll be the talk of the festival.
- Max. lmagine, seven children in one family.
Max!
Somehow I recall having made it quite clear to you... how I feel about my family singing in public.
But the committee heard them. They were enchanted.
- What did they say?
- I have never heard such enthusiasm.
Oh, darling, don't you think- just this once?
Absolutely out of the question.
Georg, this is for Austria.
For Austria? There is no Austria!
But the Anschluss happened peacefully.
- Let's at least be grateful for that.
- Grateful?
You know, Max... sometimes I don't believe I know you.
Father, I forgot. This is for you.
[ Door Opens, Closes ]
Maria, he has got to at least pretend to work with these people.
You must convince him.
- Max, I can't ask him to be less than he is.
- Then I'll talk to him.
If the children don't sing at the festival, well, it will be a reflection on Austria.
Oh, I know. It wouldn't do me any good either.
- Mother?
- Hmm?
- That sounds so nice. I like calling you mother.
- I like hearing it.
- You love Father very much. I can tell you do.
- Very much.
Mother, what do you do when you think you love someone-
I mean, when you stop loving someone... or he stops loving you?
Well, you cry a little.
And then you wait for the sun to come out.
It always does.
There are so many things
I think I should know, but I don't.
- I really don't.
- How can you?
Sometimes I feel the world is coming to an end.
And then you feel it's just beginning?
- Yes.
- It was that way with me, Liesl.
And for you, it will be just as wonderful, I promise.

[ Von Trapp ]
Liesl.
- What is it?
- Berlin.
They've offered me a commission in their navy.
I've been requested to accept immediately... and report to their naval base at Bremerhaven tomorrow.
I knew something like this would happen... but I didn't think it would be so soon.
To refuse them would be fatal for all of us.
And joining them would be... unthinkable.
Get the children all together.
Don't say anything that's going to make them worry.
Just get them ready.
We've got to get out of Austria... and this house... tonight.
[ Crickets Chirping ]
[ Max ]
It strains my back, it breaks my heart... when I think of a certain singing group that will not appear at the festival tonight.
By the time you've made the announcement, we'll be over the border.
- I hope you appreciate the sacrifice I'm making.
- You have no choice.
I know. That's why I'm making it.
[ Marta ]
Why doesn't Father turn the motor on?
- Because he doesn't want anyone to hear us!
- Shh!
[ Louisa ] What will Frau Schmidt and Franz say when they discover we're gone?
They'll be able to answer truthfully.
They didn't know anything about it if anyone asks them.
- Will we be coming back here?
- Someday, Liesl.
I do hope someday.
[ Gretl ] Are Father and Uncle Max going to push the car...
- all the way to Switzerland?
- Shh!
Something wrong with your car, Captain?
Yes, as a matter of fact, we couldn't get it started.
Karl.
Fix Captain von Trapp's car so that it will start.
[ Car Engine Starts ]
Excellent, Karl.
I've not asked you where you and your family are going.
Nor have you asked me why I'm here.
Well, apparently, we're both suffering from a deplorable lack of curiosity.
You were sent a telegram, which you did not answer.
A telegram from Admiral von Schreiber of the navy of the Third Reich.
I was under the impression, Herr Zeller... that the contents of telegrams in Austria are private!
At least the Austria I know.
I have my orders.
And they are to take you personally to Bremerhaven tonight... where you will accept your commission.
I'm afraid that's going to be quite impossible.
You see, we, uh- uh, all of us- the entire family- will be... singing in the festival tonight.
As a matter of fact, that's where we were going now.
Couldn't possibly let them down now.
I just hope we're not too late.
Yes.
And you ask me to believe that you,
Captain von Trapp, are singing in a concert?
Believe me, it will be a performance beyond anything even I've dreamt of.
Like you, Herr Zeller...
I, too, am a man of hidden talents.
[ Max ]
Yes, um- Here.
The program.
It says here only the names of the children.
It says the Von Trapp Family Singers... and I'm the head of the von Trapp family, am I not?
And these, um, travel clothes that you're all wearing?
Our costumes, naturally.
Ηerr Zeller, this night air is not good for the children's voices.
Well, a slight delay in my orders will not be serious.
Therefore you will sing.
You will all sing, but only because that's the way I want it to be.
It will demonstrate that nothing in Austria has changed.
And when you are finished singing... you, Captain von Trapp, will be taken to Bremerhaven.
Now, if you will all get into your car... we will escort the Von Trapp Family Singers to the festival.
No escort will be necessary, Ηerr Zeller.
Necessary? A pleasure, Captain.
After all, we would not want you to get lost in the crowds... would we?
No.

And while the judges are arriving at their decision...
I have been given permission to offer you an encore.
This will be the last opportunity the von Trapps will have... of singing together for a long, long time.
Even now, officials are waiting in this auditorium... to escort Captain von Trapp to his new command... in the naval forces of the Third Reich.

- Fine.
- So we got to find you a man for tonight.
No, we don't got to find me a man for tonight, Maxine.
It's a business dinner, and I could care less.
- You must know someone.
- Of course I know someone.
I know a lot of people, but I'm really not interested.
Maxine, when are you going to stop trying to find me a husband?
As soon as you give me some of that...
Come on. Just because I'm dieting.
You can have one cup of weak tea.
No sugar.
We're going to find you a man here.
Look, Max, I love you dearly, and
I appreciate your interest in my welfare... but will you cool it for tonight?
I just don't happen to think that's it right, your being without a dinner partner.
I don't need a dinner partner.
I don't need a man in my life.
I'm doing just fine, I really am.
Boy. I have a business to run...
I have three beautiful kids to keep me company.
What more do I want? I'm doing just fine.
- Will you relax?
- Yes.
- Will you cool it, please?
- I like it this way.
Devoting her life to her family.
- What's wrong with that?
- Baloney, that's what wrong.
Listen, already your kids have a better deal than you do.
At least they could go to bed with a teddy bear at night.
I knew you'd get to the bedroom sooner or later, you little devil.
What do you do on a cold night?
I turn on the electric blanket, okay?
I do better with a nudge.
- I feel sorry for Harry.
- He does all right.
Look, let's be realistic.
Suppose I was interested...
- can I tell you what's available?
- What?
Confirmed middle-aged bachelors and divorcees.
Divorcees? I don't think you call a man who's...
I don't know what you call them, but they're all after you-know-what.
Losers and factory rejects.
Well, there's always Mr. Right.
What if Mr. Right is out there?
How do I compete with the 20-year-olds?
Like they say, if you're Number Two, you have to try a little harder.
- Is that what they say?
- Yes, that's what they say.

- Mrs. McClure, I...
- Mrs. McClure will talk to you later.
- I don't even know what to say.
- Hello.
- Hello, Jake?
- Who'd you say it was?

- How are you?
- I'm fine, thank you.
- How are you?

The boys. I have three boys.
They're fine, thank you.
- He doesn't even know who I am.
- Just ask him.
- Abby, Phil's wife.
- That's right.
It's been a long time.
I meant to call you after Phil...
I understand.
- Will you just ask him?
- I'll tell you why I'm calling.
I'm having some people in tonight.
You know, for a little dinner party.
And I thought that... if you weren't doing anything, that maybe you'd like to come?
- Dinner tonight?
- Yes.
You can?
Well, that's good.
Is 4248, Myrtle Drive,
And that's 7:30-ish.
Sounds great. I'll see you then. Bye-bye.
You can't tell me you aren't bored seeing just one pair of shoes under your bed.
- Is that all you ever think about? Sex?
- Yes.
- Hi, neighbor.
- Hello, Cleo.
I seem to have misplaced my garden clippers.
Got a pair?
Just a minute.
I hate to trouble you.
I guess your husband's out of town again, huh?
You know George and his hunting trips.
- I don't see your daughter around.
- She's staying with a friend.
Here you are.
- Want to help with my garden?
- No, Cleo.
I think it's real bad luck to go digging around in somebody else's garden.
- You're scared.
- You're damn right I am.
Too bad.
- Stop by for a drink later?
- No. I have to go meet somebody.
- It's the wife of an old friend.
- I'm the wife of an old friend.
Yeah. This is different, though.
- Don't you like me?
- Sure, I like you.
- It's my husband, isn't it?
- What do you mean?
- I can't get to you because of George.
- I like George, too.
Wish I could say that.
What a wicked waste.
Toodle-oo.
Have fun, Jake.
- Molly, would you mind?
- Am I glad to see you.
Boy, do I need help.
- Someone to take...
- Molly, is the house all straightened?
- I hate shrimp.
- Yeah, I know.
- Is the house all straightened?
- Yes.
Good. Did the boys have their dinner?
You know I'm not the type to complain, but on days like this...
I get the feeling that I'm keeping three horses out of work.
- Where are they?
- The horses?
The boys.
Flip's in his room, and the other two are in there.
- Where?
- In there.
- In the living room?
- Yes.
- Molly!
- The living room. Where do you expect?
There are no other rooms here, except...
What is going on in here?
Now, you know we have company coming tonight, and look at this room!
But you told me I could paint.
That was two months ago, when you had the mumps.
I told you, Jason.
You're no better, Mitchell, but you should be. You're older.
You just get off of this couch.
I've had it. And you get over here.
Enough is enough.
You two just hop to it, and you get this place cleared up... and stop laughing at me.
Put your retainers in your mouth and leave them in there.
I don't want to see them out of your mouth again, you hear?
I have had it! You!
- Flip!
- Yeah?
- Didn't I tell you to keep an eye...
- What?
- I said didn't I tell you to keep an eye...
- I can't hear you.
If you turn that thing off, you might be able to hear what I am saying.
- Can you hear me now?
- Yes.
All right. Did I ask you to keep an eye on Mitch and Jason?
I'm sorry, Mom, but I got to get ready.
I got a date.
So have I, dear.
I have guests coming, or did you happen...
Yeah, but you don't have to shave, and that takes time... especially when you got a heavy beard like mine.
This house.
Calico.
I have enough around here without you.
None of your lip.
Calico! Come back here!
He's got my hair.
- Calico caught a gopher!
- He's got my hair!
Come here. Get out of the way, boys.
Come here to me.
- Silly dog.
- Give me that!
- Come here, Calico!
- Drop it!
Boys, will you get out of the way?
You're ruining my wig.
I'm not playing with you, you big...
I've got it.
What is it, Mom?
You heard your brother. It's a gopher.
Good night, Mom. Got to split.
- Just a minute, honey.
- I know. Drive carefully, don't be late.
- Check.
- Check.
- Hope your party's a gas.
- Thanks a lot.
- You have fun, too, you hear?
- Sexy.
Good.
What those boys need is the firm hand of a man around here.
Lord knows you've had your choice with all those fellas your sister brings around.
You know, you should do yourself and those boys a favor... and get yourself married PDQ.
Of course, it's not for me to say.
- You're so right, Molly.
- If there's one thing I believe in... it's keeping my place and keeping my mouth shut.
- It doesn't work.
- What?
Figures. The boys were playing astronaut with it.
Look at this wig. It's soaking.
I just sprayed the whole thing.
Now what do I do?
And look at me. Look at this hair, and I have company coming.
Couldn't you kind of push it up a little?
Do you have a snood?
- A what?
- You know, a Snood.
You could kind of put it around here and hold it.
No, I don't have one of those.
Will you just stick it in the oven?
- The oven?
- Yeah, at 200.
And save some space.
I'm going to stick my head in with it.
Oven, indeed.
Many more days like this, you'll find me in the oven.
- Mom?
- What?
How come you didn't show up at my baseball game today?
I couldn't make it, Mitchell.
I got busy at the yard, honey.
- Maybe next Saturday, I can come.
- Always the same excuse.
Get those washcloths moving.
It's not fun-and-games time.
Let me try that!
- Mrs. McClure?
- Yes?
- Will you come here a minute?
- I'll be there in a minute.
Now, you don't get out of here until you're rinsed off. Do you hear me?
Didn't I say no fun and games?
Now you get back in that tub!
Look what you're doing!
- You can't... What?
- Will you please come down here?
- I need you!
- I can't come now, Molly!
We'll just let ourselves in.
I guess Abby's busy someplace.
Don't get out of that tub, or I'll tan your...
- Hi, Jake.
- Hi.
- I guess we're a little early, huh?
- No, I'm a little late.
We met Jake in the driveway.
Jake, how about a drink?
Harry can fix you a drink.
Mrs. McClure, about that oven.
I've got to put the meat on broil, but your hair's on bake.
Now which should I do first?
I need the hair, Molly.
False eyelashes, false hair, false bosoms.
In my day and age, women were flesh and blood.
Nowadays, they're 80% nylon and 20% foam rubber.
Harry, dear, the drinks.
Jake, a nice drink never hurt anybody.
What?
- Come on.
- All right.
Max, I need your help. Wasn't that terrible?
- What must he think now?
- Who cares? He's adorable.
- Will you come on?
- You're a mess.
This place has been a wall-to-wall disaster area since I arrived home today.
You're a great deal of help to me.
What am I supposed to say to him?
"Meet my sister, the girl with the golden arm and her hair in the oven"?
Where is my hair?
Don't worry about your hair.
You aren't even dressed yet.
What are you going to wear this evening?
I'm wearing this white suit.
Is that all right with you?
Abby, come on.
Why don't you get into that marvelous red geranium hostess thing?
Because it's not that kind of a party.
This is business.
All those people in there are customers.
Who cares about the lumber set?
You are dressing for him.
- I have to be folksy.
- Folksy, shmolksy.
Come on, get into the red thing.
I swear, you are making me so nervous,
I don't know what I'm doing.
I am not going to wear the red dress.
Nice party, Abby.
Say hello to Mr. Iverson, boys.
This is Jason and Mitchell.
- Hi, fellows.
- Hello.
You've met everybody here.
Now it's time to go to bed.
Are you going to marry Mommy?
No, he isn't, dear. Come on.
Boy, Aunt Maxine is sure going to be disappointed.
- So, you're a chemical engineer?
- Yes, that's right.
- Where do you do your engineering?
- Pacific Refineries, mostly.
I just happen to know somebody you should meet.
My cousin Dora.
She just hasn't been able to find a man her intellectual equal.
Has she tried the Yellow Pages?
You single guys, you got it made.
- Airline stewardesses.
- And nurses.
So, you're Abby's fella, huh?
You're getting a great girl.
Do you know what the worst thing that ever happened to mankind is?
- The pill.
- Helps me sleep nights, though.
I declare, everything is just delicious.
That Abby is a wonder.
I just can't understand why some man hasn't just grabbed her up by now.
You know, any man would be lucky to have her for his wife.
And I know that there is nothing more in this world that she would desire... than to have a loving husband, all her own... to love her every night, give her a big hug, keep her cozy and warm.
Now, this is the type of woman...
I tell you, if this wasn't my house,
I'd go home.
- Nice doggy. Good boy.
- Calico, stop it.
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.
- Here, use this.
- Thank you.
- I fixed you a drink.
- No, thanks.
I'd better get going. I just got my coat.
- I'm sorry you have to leave so early.
- So am I... but I've got these customers coming in on the 11:30 plane... all the way from Akron, and I promised them I'd be there.
I understand. Sure.
- We'll have to get together sometime.
- That would be fun.
- Okay. Well, good night, Abby.
- Good night, Jake.
- Thanks again for inviting me.
- You're welcome. You have my napkin.
- I'm sorry. Good night.
- Bye.
Mrs. McClure, if you think you have any milk left for breakfast, think again.
They finished all the bread, too, and we could use some more butter.
And that Mr. Bates spilled all the orange juice.
- Yes, and tomorrow's my day off, you know.
- Okay.
I'll go to the market tonight.
Listen, as a surprise, why don't you leave all of this for her till Monday?
We'll be here tomorrow morning at 8:00 with the camper.
- Have the kids ready.
- Cheerio.
- Good night, Abby.
- Toodle-oo.
You have 48 seconds to get to the airport.
You know, what happened was...
I was just getting ready to leave the house... and the phone rang, and it was the people that I was going to pick up at the airport.
And they called from Akron.
They canceled because of a...
Anyway, I could've stayed longer. I'm sorry.
You didn't miss a thing, believe me.
- Good night, Jake.
- Good night.
Here.
Thank you.
- I really am sorry, you know.
- You're sorry you got caught.
It wasn't very nice of me to go running out like that.
No, it wasn't nice, but it was smart.
Okay, will you quit making it easy for me?
Just let me apologize.
- I'm sorry, and I apologize.
- I accept.
- You want to get some coffee?
- Where?
- At the drive-in.
- Okay.
- I'll meet you there.
- All right.
- Hi, sweetie.
- Hi, Herbie.
We're just about to close, but for you, tell me what it is you like... and I'll see to it personally.
Order anything you want, and I'll charge you for a doughnut.
What do you think you're doing, buddy?
This ain't that kind of chick. This is class.
- Get back in your own machine.
- Let him stay, Herbie. He's kind of nice.
I hope you know what you're doing, but from here on... it's full price for everything.
- Can we have some coffee?
- Big spender. Not even a doughnut?
No, I want her to love me for myself, not the things I can give her.
You blew it. You could've had steak.
- You're not sore, huh?
- No, I'm not.
Pretty lousy story about the airport, though.
You would've gotten away with it if I hadn't needed bread.
How long has it been, anyway?
About six years? Seven?
Yeah, I think about seven.
Two coffees, one with cream.
Sure you don't want separate checks?
How about a receipt for income tax purposes?
No, that's okay. Thank you.
That's good.
- Well?
- Nothing.
I'm just trying to picture you running that lumberyard.
I'm a whiz on a band saw, if that interests you.
You run a home, too, take care of all those kids.
Now, that's difficult.
- You ever find any time for yourself?
- I manage.
I have a housekeeper, Mrs. Benson by name.
- Yeah, I met her.
- And it all works.
- I think he's trying to tell us something.
- It's 2:00. Closing time.
Listen...
Don't tell me you were going to apologize again.
- No, I wasn't.
- You weren't?
- Good night.
- Good night, Jake.
Thank you.
- Who is it? Jake? Hi.
- Hi.
I couldn't let you carry that heavy bag all by yourself.
- Thank you.
- It's nothing.
A while ago, I couldn't wait to get out of here. Now you can't get rid of me.
Listen, I want to see you again, okay?
Do you?
- I'm available.
- All right.
- Tomorrow night too soon?
- No.
I'll tell you what we'll do.
We'll go get some spaghetti or something.
I'll pick you up about 7:00.
Now, come on, you guys. Cut it out.
I'm trying to read the paper, so let's have a quiet breakfast.
Mom was up late last night.
She's probably beat.
So settle down, all right? Now eat.
Good morning, group. How you doing?
Hats off at the table, buddy boy.
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi, sweetie.
Boy, have we got a day for a picnic.
It is gorgeous.
Listen, don't forget your graduation rehearsal.
- Gee, I wish you could go with us.
- Yeah.
- Hold on till we get the bike off.
- There we go.
I'll take care of things here.
Come on, kids. There we go.
Everybody out?
You just go ahead and get dressed.
Can I give you a hand?
No matter what time you get home, call me later.
- Mom, Mr. Iverson called.
- He did? What'd he say?
He said it was his kid's birthday or something.
Anyway, he won't be able to make it tonight.
Band: The Grass Roots
Song: Feelings
I have known you all my life
Girl it seems to me
Then she will always be
Very close to me, close to me
Very close to me now
No need to tell you now
That a time like this
My feelings can't be helped...
Look at the one with the yellow dress.
They're fabulous.
- Aren't you having a good time?
- I really am.
- Wasn't this a great idea?
- Yeah, it was.
You love it?
- Harry loves it. Don't you?
- Yeah.
Harry and I have been dying for an excuse to come here.
I've never known till now, the feelings I've had inside
The feelings you've never known
The feelings you've never found
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na naaaaaa
I will live for long time
And then you'll see
Just how sad a man can be
Oh girl, can't you see
That it’s me, can't ya see it’s...
Tell me what happened last night.
He followed you home from the supermarket...
How does it feel to be married to a sex maniac?
- Every home should have one.
- Why ask him?
Ask the mailman.
Really, it's kind of a shame that Jake didn't come... because I think we'd make kind of a handsome foursome.
- Yeah, he would like it, I think.
- Yeah.
She's pretty, isn't she?
Why shouldn't he go out with a young chick?
Why take a bus when you can fly?
Molly, don't forget to have Jason ready at 11:30... for his doctor's appointment.
Ma, I don't want to go to the doctor.
Bobby Gold's birthday party is today.
You have to have a checkup to go to camp.
And Bobby's present is in on the hall table.
It's all wrapped, ready to go.
Telephone!
It's Mr. Iverson.
Tell him I've already gone. I'm in a hurry.
Boss, Michaels said he's got to have all his window frames today.
- Will you tell him he'll get them?
- All right.
Some guy named Iverson called twice.
He wants to talk to you.
- There's his number.
- Thanks.
We just faked her out, huh, Mitch?
Good night, boys, and I mean good night.
San Francisco Bay Area will show signs of precipitation in the a.m., followed by clearing and somewhat bluer skyes.
Hello.
Hey, you're awful hard to get a hold of.
What are you doing, running from the law?
Hello, Jake.
Flip did tell you about why
I couldn't make it last night, didn't he?
Yeah. He said that it was... some kind of a birthday or something.
It's okay.
Yeah, I forgot all about it.
- You want to have lunch tomorrow?
- I don't know.
I'm so busy at the yard right now.
How about some evening, then?
Friday okay?
I don't think so. It's pretty hectic.
This a brush-off?
I guess you got your reasons.
Whatever if is, left? leave if at That; then,
- Bye, Abby.
- Bye, Jake.
- There he is. Look at your brother.
- Hi, Mom.
- Guys.
- You look nice. You look terrific.
Thanks.
- Why you wearing that funny hat?
- Because he's graduating.
- Do you know your speech?
- Did it 14 times to the mirror.
That should do it.
I'm a nervous wreck about that speech.
Excuse me just a second, Mom. Hey, Charlie.
I guess maybe...
Boys, come back here.
Now, you know what I told you.
If you behave today, you can go with Aunt Max to the lake for the weekend.
But if you don't, the deal is off.
- Flip going, too?
- With you? No, honey.
He's not going with you.
He's going on his own weekend.
I guess we can go on in now.
Come on, guys.
Yeah, Mom?
There's a girl standing out there.
She's sort of facing us.
She has very long brown hair hanging kind of in the front with bangs. Who is she?
That's Stacey Iverson.
- Finally made it, huh?
- Not quite.
They haven't given me my diploma yet.
You better go get it before they get wise to you.
Attention, please.
Will the graduates and their guests kindly fake their seats?
The ceremony is about to begin, Thank you,
Good night.
Hi.
Listen, I don't know what happened with us, but I think we ought to talk it over. Okay?
And I brought this stuff along we could talk it over, over.
Come in.
- How are the kids?
- Fine. They're away for the weekend.
- How are you?
- Fine, thank you.
If I'd known it was going to be this easy...
I'd have bought the domestic stuff.
- I'll get the glasses.
- I got glasses.
There.
- Thought of everything, huh?
- Of course.
Hey, Calico.
How are you?
You're supposed to eat caviar with this stuff, but I like popcorn better.
- You like popcorn?
- I love it. So does he.
Now, then...
Champagne Charlie, the last of the big spenders.
You ever gonna tell me why you're so mad at me?
Nope.
I had to let you in.
- Want some coffee?
- It's late.
- I think I better go.
- Come on.
You coming, Stacey?
It feels good in here. It's cold out.
Talk.
I'll get the coffee on.
It'll be just a minute.
You just sit there and take it easy.
My goodness. It was so good, wasn't it?
I ate too much.
What are you reading? Teen Scoop.
Gossip, huh?
I like that picture of you, Stacey.
It's darling.
- How old are you here?
- Three.
- It's darling.
- Pretty frame.
Daddy gave it to Mother for their anniversary.
I wonder what time it is. Do you know?
- No, but I think it's kind of late.
- Yeah, I think it is.
Oh, dear.
Jake, I don't think I'll stay and have coffee.
Why not? What's the matter?
I have such a day tomorrow.
- Well, it's still early.
- And coffee...
Good night, Stacey.
I'll see you soon, honey.
- Good night, Mrs. McClure.
- I'll take you out.
That's okay, I can manage.
Thanks. Good night.
You sure? Good night.
- How about some of that coffee?
- Okay.
I haven't got any cigarettes.
I'll go down to the corner and get some.
Turn that off in about five minutes.
I'll be right back, honey.
- Back again, sweetie?
- Hi, Herbie.
Herbie Fleck's too good a thing to pass up.
I figured you'd come around to your senses.
Two coffees, please.
Two coffees. I should have guessed
Diamond Jim would be here.
Diamond Jim. Two coffees.
Cigarettes?
Yeah, I'm buying a lot of cigarettes lately.
This is ridiculous.
I'm sorry about that kid.
I think we'll just leave her home next time.
Jake, we just have to give her time, that's all.
She'll get used to me. I think.
I hope.
- I did.
- Did you?
You're pretty nice.
- Well, so long, pal.
- Good night.
- It's been very nice, Mr. Iverson.
- It's been grand.
And now here are some scenes from next Week's episode,
- Okay, fellas.
- Mom!
Jason, come on,
I'll give you a piggyback ride.
Don't bother, Mr. Iverson. I'll do it.
- Sorry about that.
- I guess he's just protecting his domain.
Stacey does it all the time.
It doesn't mean anything.
- It's just gonna take time.
- Excuse me.
- Going out, honey?
- No, there's a show I want to watch.
Well, why don't you watch it in your room, then?
I want to watch it in color.
I think I'm gonna go home.
Well, guess I'd better get going.
- Good night, Flip.
- I'll see you out.
See you at the drive-in, all right?
Oh, darn, I forgot Molly's pumpernickel.
- Get it in the morning.
- Honey, you know how she is.
She loves to have pumpernickel with her breakfast.
I won't be but a minute.
Don't tell me. I know.
- Two cups of coffee, right?
- Right.
The dame's got to be a masochist.
Hi.
This has got to be the craziest courtship in history.
I'm sick of this drive-in,
I'll tell you that.
I'm getting kind of sick of Herbie what's his name.
Fleck.
- You want to go for a ride someplace?
- I always want to go for a ride someplace.
Flip. You scared me.
Do you know what time it is?
It's after 11:00.
- You're kidding. Is it really?
- You said you'd be right back.
I know I did, but it was such a pretty night that I took a drive.
- You'd better get to bed. It's late.
- You could have called.
I didn't think that you would be up.
You knew I'd be worried, you being out in the car and all.
- Honey, I didn't think you'd be sitting up.
- You know what I was going to do?
I was getting ready to call the hospital.
Will you please keep your voice down?
You'll wake the boys.
I want you to calm down, too.
I'm sorry if I upset you, but I didn't think it was necessary to call.
Let's not make a big case out of nothing, okay?
Okay.
Good night, honey.
- Mom...
- What?
Where's the pumpernickel?
Let's shape up, huh, Mom?
- Hello, honey.
- Hi, Mr. Iverson.
Hi, Janey. I didn't know you were here.
- Janey's spending the night.
- That's good.
- Have a good time at Mrs. McClure's?
- Yeah, very nice.
Kind of late, though, huh?
I guess it is. Gee, I'll go to bed then.
Good night.
Good night, Mr. Iverson.
Are you having an affair with Mrs. McClure?
Do you mean am I getting serious about her? Is that what you mean?
You're talking like a child.
- I asked you if you're having an affair...
- I heard that.
- What the hell kind of question's that?
- Dad, I'm not a baby anymore.
I understand sex.
I've known about it for years.
What do you mean, you've known about it for years?
No, Daddy, I said I understand it.
I didn't say I...
- Are you having an affair...
- Will you be quiet?
Janey's out there.
What's the matter with you?
- Well?
- Well, what?
Don't you think you're a little old to be carrying on like this?
You could get in trouble, you know.
- Hello?
- Hi.
- How's it over at your house?
- Very hostile.
- A little indignant around here.
- You know I forgot the pumpernickel?
- Yeah.
- Why didn't you remind me?
Because I forgot.
I miss you.
How old are you, anyway?
- Why?
- Nevermind.
I just know I'm too old for any more of this fooling around.
- You know what I mean?
- So am I.
- Last time I meet you in a drive-in.
- You should've been here when I came in.
- Ridiculous, making up excuses...
- The house was dark...
- getting a sex lecture from a 17-year-old.
- Flip switches on the lights.
- And I'm fed up with the whole shot.
- So am I.
Shut up. I love you. And you love me, right?
- I love you, right.
- Okay.
Which one?
I know which one it is.
- Why don't you go in the house?
- No.
- What are you standing there for?
- Because.
You don't really want me to pick you up and carry you over the threshold, do you?
- Yeah.
- You do?
- Calico.
- Shut up. We're married.
What's a fellow have to do to get tucked in around here, lady?
Well, you got to have a number, sir.
He has to go.
I'm freezing. Put it back.
Calico, get out of there.
He's ruining those camellias.
Come on, Calico, hurry up.
It's 3:00 in the morning, boy.
I'm cold.
What time's Stacey coming tomorrow?
She's at Janey's for the night, and I told her to be here about 8:00.
- Oh, boy. I can't face it.
- Come on, now.
All we have to do, we just sit them down, we give them some breakfast... and then you tell them.
- You're a right-side sleeper, too?
- Are you?
It's all right.
No, we just got married too quick, that's all.
Never mind.
I don't care. It doesn't make any difference.
Where are your shoes?
- My shoes?
- Yes, I want your shoes.
- What are you doing?
- Never mind.
There, that's for my sister.
- Your sister?
- Right.
Anything else?
There's a man in Mommy's bed!
I didn't expect you to do this.
I didn't, she did. It's my day off, you know.
Of course, if I'd known this was your wedding day...
I could've rearranged everything, but I have plans.
- I'm sorry.
- That's all right.
Thank you. And congratulations, again.
It's so romantic.
Eloping to Las Vegas and all that.
I bet you were a beautiful bride.
Oh, dear. I guess I'd better go before I get sloppy.
Have a nice day, Molly.
Thank you, Stacey.
- Thanks for fixing the table so pretty...
- That's all right.
...making breakfast and everything.
- Can I help? What can I do for you?
- Nothing. I've done everything.
Honey, I know how you feel. Really, I do.
And I know how the boys feel.
But you know something?
I love your father very much.
- Please let me do that.
- It's okay. I know how Daddy likes it.
These are pretty good eggs, lady.
How'd you know that's the way I like them?
Stacey made them. She did everything.
I always said you're a pretty good cook.
- Good morning.
- Hi, Flip.
Good morning, Mr. Iverson.
Isn't it about time you started calling me Jake?
Honey, sit over here.
- This your chair?
- That's all right.
- Go on, sit down.
- That's all right.
He doesn't mind, Jake.
Oh, boy, this is good.
Mr. Iverson, are you my daddy now?
- Yep. Think you're gonna like that?
- I don't know yet.
Listen, I think today calls for some kind of celebration, don't you?
What do you say we stay home from work... then we can all spend the day together somehow?
Let's do.
Oh, boy! One big, happy family!
This will take care of our share.
- Boy, am I glad you two got married.
- You are?
Because with six you get egg roll.
Are we going to be going home soon, Dad?
We were just talking about that, honey.
Our house is pretty small, and seeing as how there's six of us now... we'd be a lot better off over at Abby's place.
- We're going to be living at her house?
- Oh, boy.
- You can say that again.
- Oh, boy.
- What's the matter with that?
- Nothing's the matter with that.
Only one little tiny thing like there's no room for me, that's all.
You can say that again.
Honey, wait, this is just temporary.
We can fix up a couch or something for tonight.
Oh, great. Excuse me, please.
She's absolutely right.
She shouldn't have to give up her bedroom.
- What have you got in mind?
- Why don't we all go to your house?
There's only two bedrooms in my house.
That wouldn't be fair to the boys.
Where will they sleep? On the floor?
You don't have to worry about the boys.
They adjust.
Shut up out there.
It's gonna be a night, I'm telling you.
I said, stop it right now.
- Mr. Iverson, you know what?
- What?
Our dog hates your dog.
They're just talking when they bark like that.
They'll get to like each other.
Good night.
You mind turning the radio off, honey?
Good night, Flip.
- Mom, why can't I...
- Your brother's asleep.
Mom, why can't I sleep on the floor like Mitch?
Next time. Tonight you have to rough it on the couch.
Night, pal.
Now go to sleep.
The boys left the sink filthy.
- There's cleaning stuff under there.
- I'm not cleaning up after them!
- I'll do it.
- No. Why should you do it?
- Nobody has to clean. The boys...
- I don't mind.
- Mom, this is a drag.
- What is?
Can't I go back to our place and sleep?
This is our house, Flip.
But that crummy cot in the kitchen.
What's so bad about sleeping in the kitchen?
Why can't we have some laughs around here?
Mommy.
You know you can grow to hate that word? What is it?
- Can I sleep with you?
- Out!
Get going!
Nothing the matter with that.
I was just going to ask you the same thing.
It's very important for Stacey.
She's the one who has the big adjustment to make.
What about Flip? It's not so easy for him.
He's used to being the man around your house.
Now he winds up in my kitchen, on a cot, with his radio off.
I know I shouldn't laugh at that, but what else can we do?
What we gotta do is sell both of the houses, then we buy a new one... and we move into that.
It won't be your house or my house.
It'll be everybody's house, okay?
That's a very good idea.
And until we sell, we're gonna...
Until we sell, we'll alternate between the houses.
- Go back and forth.
- You mean, a different house every night?
- Why not? We can manage.
- I married a gypsy.
We have to be fair to everybody.
When Molly is over here, we'll be there... and when she's there, we'll be here.
Then Stacey will have her own bedroom, and that's what I want.
She's got to have her own bedroom.
- That do anything for you?
- It better.
- Kind of cute.
- I'm exhausted.
Mommy.
What's the matter?
I can't find the bathroom.
There are a couple of things that I think we ought to hash over.
There's a couple of things that I...
It's darling. I love it.
Why don't you take that? Come on, Stacey.
- How much is that bill?
No, I'll pay for it. I have an account here.
Daddy gave it to me.
I know it's been hard for you... to get used to having a father around the house again.
But I think if both of us just...
Thank you.
I'm sorry, but I have to go.
I promised to meet some friends.
Okay, honey. I'll see you later.
Whose house will we be at tonight, yours or mine?
Mine.
Come on.
- Are they having fun out there?
- I hope so. I don't know.
Listen, when are you two going to stop this traveling circus bit, back and forth?
What did you get in Vegas, a marriage license or a driver's license?
- You haven't even had a honeymoon.
- We know that.
Why don't you both come to San Francisco with us for the weekend?
- That's a great idea!
- I wish we could.
- We can't.
- Why?
Because the kids would kill each other, that's why.
Now, there is a perfect solution:
When you get back, you pick the winners.
- Hi.
- What's going on in there?
Stacey's just having a party, that's all.
We wanted to watch the basketball game in color.
Come on, guys.
What did you say about San Francisco?
Boy, am I ready.
One thing I don't understand is why parents never run away from home.
We'd love to have you come.
- Let's go, Max.
- I'll be right there, honey.
Well, see you around, fellas.
Bye-bye.
I just told you a second marriage would never work out.
- Get out of here.
- Be careful.
- Hello.
- Here I come, ready or not.
Come on!
Come on, we're going to my house, where we can be alone.
- Howdy, neighbor.
- Hi, Cleo.
Sorry I haven't been over lately.
I've been in Mexico getting a divorce.
- I'm sorry. I thought you were alone, Jake.
- No, I'm not.
Abby, this is Mrs. Ruskin.
She's the neighbor next door.
This is Abby, my wife.
I just happened to be walking down the street.
It's a nice night for streetwalking.
She is your wife, isn't she?
Will you two be living here?
- No, I really don't think so.
- No.
Have fun, kiddies.
You have my number.
We do?
She used to baby-sit for Stacey.
Besides, her husband is about that big... he's a tackle for the Green Bay Packers, and I'm scared to death of him.
Mrs. McClure or Iverson.
- Hello, Molly.
- This is my night to be here, isn't it?
Yes, you're right.
- This is Mr. Weiss.
- Nice meeting you.
I already know Mr. Iverson.
Post Office Department.
Had this route for 14 years.
How do you do?
What happened?
What did you come back for?
Mr. Iverson... We...
I wanted to see if the "For sale" sign was still out on the lawn.
It is.
- Good night. Have a nice time.
- Nice meeting you.
Congratulations, and good luck on your marriage.
- Thanks a lot. Good night.
- Thank you.
- Tomorrow's my day off, you know.
- Yeah.
You know we're right back where we started, don't you?
I guess so.
Even switching houses hasn't helped, has it?
No. I'm getting very depressed.
Here. It gives you gas.
Pleasure to serve you.
Why don't you come in again sometime when you need empty cups?
Why don't you two get married so you'll have a place to go?
Why don't they get married so they'll have a place to go?
My house... would be perfect, but we need another bedroom.
We haven't got another bedroom.
And that way...
Molly would have a bedroom... and Stacey would have a bedroom.
We haven't got another bedroom, honey.
I can't just snap my fingers like that and get you another bedroom.
You just did it.
The camper!
We're gonna use the camper for the extra bedroom... until Aunt Maxine gets back from San Francisco.
We're all gonna quit moving, this back-and-forth stuff... and we'll stay right here in this house.
Your mother's got a little headache this morning so...
That's better.
Mom, can me and Jason sleep in it?
The camper!
No, you boys have to sleep in the house.
- Good morning, everybody.
- Hi, Mom.
Good morning.
- I'll take the camper, Mom.
- Fine, Flip. That's good.
But he already has a room.
Why can't I sleep in the camper?
We didn't think you'd want to sleep out there.
- You take my room.
- Thanks a lot. I don't want your room.
- It's settled. Forget it, will you?
- But I want to sleep out there!
Quiet!
Excuse me a minute.
I'll tell you who sleeps in the camper.
Your mother and I will sleep in it...
- and that's the end of it.
- What?
- You and I are gonna sleep...
- But I thought you said...
Quiet! Be quiet.
And you be quiet.
You've got a headache, remember?
You and I are gonna sleep in the camper, that's who's gonna sleep there.
That is the end of it.
Right now. Once and for all.
Don't hold dinner for me, because I'll be late.
- Now look what you did.
- What I did?
I'm sorry.
- What?
- I'll be home early.
I knew you would be.
I'm sorry. Bye-bye.
We will sleep in the camper, though.
Knock it off! Go out in the back.
- This is adult talk.
- Big man!
Go on.
So, my room isn't good enough for you?
Nothing about you is good enough for me.
This house is so weird!
- Do you know what's wrong with you?
- What, Mr. McClure?
You're spoiled rotten, Miss Iverson.
Excuse me.
- Stacey, what are you looking for, dear?
- A glass.
They're right in here, where they've always been.
Everything's in such dumb places here!
In our house, you can find something when you want it.
Why don't you rearrange the kitchen the way you'd like it?
Why don't you do that?
- I do know what Daddy likes.
- Okay, Stacey, you've got your wish.
If you want to be the lady of the house, you're gonna be it.
It's Molly's day off.
You can take charge of everything.
We'll start with the ironing, then we'll do a little mending... floor polishing, a little silver polishing.
Don't forget to do the bedrooms and clean the bathrooms.
Then you'll have to do a little marketing for dinner... and we'll have dinner at 6:30.
Have a nice day, Stacey.
If you want me, I'll be at the hairdresser.
Hi, Stacey. You'll have the room in just a shake, honey.
How's it going?
- Here's the list. All finished.
- Thanks.
Except I didn't know where to put that big silver tray.
In the living room chest.
What about tomorrow's list?
Would you like to work on that?
But tomorrow's Saturday.
I know, honey, but there's an awful lot to do.
You'll have to get an early start.
First, I want you to call your friends and go to the beach for the whole day.
Then come home and fix your hair and your nails... and make some nice long phone calls... and have your dinner, and go to the movies.
Unless you'd rather be the lady of the house.
Get some rest. You can use it.
What are you doing in a cab?
The car broke down way out in the boondocks.
- What have you been up to?
- See for yourself.
- Nearly had a breakdown, too.
- Where's Abby?
She's in the bedroom. She just got home.
"Laundry, ironing, mending, floors."
Just got home? Where's she been?
I think she was out shopping, getting her hair done, and stuff.
Her hair done?
You mean, you did all this by yourself?
- Sure did. Been at it since this morning.
- Floors, too.
You know, Dad, it made me realize something.
- What the hell's going on around here?
- What?
This is what I'm talking about.
How come you got to lay all the work on Stacey?
- What's the matter with Flip?
- Well, aren't you silly?
- What do you mean, silly?
- What's the matter with you?
Why do you have to lay it all on her?
- Flip's playing basketball.
- Basketball? That's great.
Stop raising your voice to me!
If you shut up long enough,
I'll explain it to you.
- Don't tell me to shut up!
- I won't discuss it with you, Jake Iverson.
That's fine! Who wants to discuss it?
If you want to know the truth, it was an experiment.
An experiment? In what, child labor?
A 14-hour day?
- That is the lowest thing...
- Lowest what?
- I was trying to help her!
- Help her?
It'll never happen again,
I'll tell you that.
- You can be damn sure of that.
- You big bully!
- What's he so sore about?
- Just go to bed, both of you.
- You owe me an apology.
- I owe you an apology?
- You certainly do.
- For what? You owe me an explanation.
I still don't know what this is about.
I don't owe you anything!
You're just stupid.
If you don't know what I was trying to do for that girl...
- Don't call me stupid.
- I didn't call you stupid.
You just called me stupid, and you're right!
We own two houses, and I'm sleeping in the back of a truck!
- And whose idea was that?
- All right, it was my idea.
- Flip wanted to sleep out here.
- So Flip could sleep out here. Fine.
That was a brilliant idea.
- Whose idea was it to get this thing?
- Yours!
No, you don't remember because we were at the drive-in... and you were roaring drunk at the time.
That's nice.
Why don't you shout it for the neighbors?
You were roaring drunk at the time!
You're just mean!
- You know you're wrong about Stacey.
- Of course, I'm wrong.
I'm your husband, I am married,
I've got to be wrong all of the time.
You can't even say you're sorry!
I am sorry, all right. I am sorry.
That's nice. What are you sorry about, getting married?
- Did I say I was sorry I married you?
- No, but you're thinking it.
- How do you know what I'm thinking?
- I know what you're thinking every minute!
You're a mind reader!
If that's the way you want it, then it's fine with me!
Fine with me!
And you can go back to that baby-sitter, whatever her name is!
Cleo. Her name is Cleo!
And furthermore, she can have you!
I'll deliver you there myself, personally!
Bed and all.
Jake, I want to apologize.
I'm coming back right now.
Here you go. Two coffees.
They're on Fleck. Again.
Listen, can you lend me some clothes to wear?
It was that dame, right?
Tore the clothes right off you.
- No.
- What a tiger.
How about some clothes?
I ain't got no clothes, except dirty uniforms.
- That's fine.
- Dirty uniforms?
- I don't care.
- I don't mind. All right with me, buddy.
- The latest color: chocolate.
- It's all right.
I'll tell you one thing.
I hope you're not gonna make a regular thing out of this.
This is a hot dog stand, not a haberdashery.
Can you give me a lift home, do you think?
Now I'm a bus station.
Hey, Duke! Come here!
This is not part of the regular service at Fleck's.
Come here. Okay.
Give this guy a lift, will you?
- I got deliveries to make.
- So you got another one.
Drop them and dump him.
Pardon me!
I'm looking for someone.
- Actually, I'm looking for a man.
- Man? How's that again, baby?
I'm looking for my husband.
I lost him, and I've got to find him.
What does this cat resemble and look like, baby?
Actually, he'd be easy to recognize... because he's in his undershorts and he's carrying a teddy bear.
A teddy bear. He took a trip. Went that way.
- What did he say?
- He went that-a-way.
Thanks very much.
Saddle up, friend.
We shall give thou a hand.
That is our bag, to help folk.
We will follow us!
We gotta find little old Teddy Bear!
We better stay with them.
- Come on. You didn't turn sharp enough.
- All right!
Where'd you learn to drive?
You're blocking my whole place!
What's the matter with you, you dumb blonde broad?
- Are the chickens all right?
- Are they all right?
She hit a chicken truck?
Route 6 is just one big fricassee.
Driver's rounding up the birds.
Then he'll be down to press charges.
Sergeant, I've got to find my husband.
Your royal fuzz, let our mother go.
Let our mother go
- Are they with you?
- Your fuzziness... my group is baby's character witness.
We are about to commit for you one sit-in... until our baby is thoroughly released.
Bye-bye.
Down, Cloud, down.
You've got no driver's license, no identification.
I think I'd like to talk to this husband myself. Pick him up.
Let's have a description. How old is he?
I don't know.
Sergeant, the whole thing happened because of the children.
They were only happy living in their own home.
We tried moving around, and it didn't work.
So we decided to go to my house.
We thought the camper would make everybody happy.
That didn't work, either.
Jake and I had an argument... and I said nasty things to him that I didn't mean, and I said:
"You can go back to Cleo.
I'll personally take you there myself."
That's what I was doing. I was taking him when he fell out of the camper.
That's fine.
You're free, baby.
You're not going anywhere, sister, but into a cell.
What is this?
You're allowed one call.
Use the pay phone, please.
I demand my...
I'll take it.
You ain't groovy.
What's going on? Where's your mother?
- She's in jail.
- She's where?
- Police station. She needs identification.
- Here. Give me that. I'll go.
Mom called me.
She doesn't want you, and neither do we.
I heard you yelling at her.
We had a peaceful family here until you came along.
So why don't you take her and go back where you came from?
You stay here with them.
I'm taking the station wagon.
Shut up, all of you!
All right. Come on.
Just a misunderstanding, Sergeant.
Any further questions, you can Contact me at my law firm.
All right, Mr. Scott.
The truck driver will be here any minute.
You and Mrs. Iverson can work out the damage claims with him.
Okay, all settled! Now clear out of here!
Not so tout de suite, my sweet.
We go when baby go.
Stacey can't accept me, and the boys can't accept Jake, and that's it.
- You see what you've done?
- I'm sorry, mister.
I didn't see you were gonna turn.
Sorry? I'll show you how sorry you're gonna be.
Hold it. Wait a minute, fella.
Just take it easy.
- Who sent for the Good Humor man?
- You don't go hitting kids.
You go on over in the car. Go on.
All right, I'll hit a man.
- Jake, are you all right?
- Yeah, no, I'm okay.
- What did you do?
- I'll tell you later.
Don't worry, Mom. We'll get you out.
Quiet. Just hold it down here.
Are you the husband?
I didn't recognize you without the teddy bear.
Our Teddy Bear.
Wait a minute.
You mean to tell me that she is part of this family?
This has got to be a plot against the chickens of America.
I want to press charges against all of them!
Hold it down! One at a time!
All right, you first.
There was an accident in the parking lot.
I don't know whose fault it was.
- What parking lot?
- Out there.
When I got there, this ape here was trying to beat up my kid.
And when my dad tried to break it up, he hit him when he wasn't looking.
Self-defense, Sergeant!
The whole mob came at us!
Even her. She tried to knock my head off.
- The girl was in this, too?
- Why not? She's part of the family.
- Groovy tribe.
- They fight dirty, too!
All of them.
Look where that little kid bit me.
It serves you right.
You're twice as big as my brother.
That guy there. He had no right to mix in.
He sure did. We're his family.
He's our father.
Perhaps this can best be settled in court.
Have your attorney call me.
Thanks, Uncle Harry.
Uncle Harry?
They even got their own lawyer.
I guess that about settles everything.
All right, you can all go.
You guys never stood a chance when you took on that family.

The constable's responstable.
Now, how does that sound?
Hmm...
Hello, Miss Lark
I got one for you
Miss Lark likes to walk in the park...
- Grrrr.
- ...with Andrew!
Arf! Arf!
- Hello, Andrew.
- Arf! Arf! Grrrr! Grrrr!
Ah, Mrs Cory
A story for you
Your daughters were shorter than you, but they grew.
Dear Miss Persimmon...
Yes?
Wind's in the east
Mist comin' in
Like something is brewin'
About to begin
Can't put me finger on what lies in store
But I feel what's to happen
All happened before
Arf! Arf! Grrrr!
I'm sorry. Where was I?
Thank you, one and all, for your kind support.
Ah, Miss Lark, thank you.
Crikey.
Bless you, guv.
Generosity itself, that's what you are.
No charge.
Oh, it's you. Hello.
Number 17 Cherry
Tree Lane, you say?
All right. Come with me.
This here's Cherry Tree Lane.
Nice little spot, you might say.
Number 17 is just down a bit.
Now this imposing edifice what first greets the eye is the home of Admiral Boom, late of His Majesty's navy.
Likes his house shipshape and
Bristol fashion at all times.
- Time gun ready?
- Ready and charged, sir.
- Three minutes and six seconds.
- Aye, aye, sir.
What he's famous for is punctuality.
The whole world takes its time from Greenwich, but Greenwich takes its time from Admiral Boom.
What cheer, Admiral?
Good afternoon!
Where are you bound?
Some parties want to see number 17.
- Enter that in the log.
- Aye, aye, sir.
Some advice, young man.
Storm signals are up at 17.
Heavy weather brewing there.
Thank you, sir.
I'll keep an eye skinned.
Here we are.
Number 17 Cherry Tree Lane, residence of George Banks, esquire.
Hello, hello, hello.
The admiral's right.
Heavy weather brewing at number 17, and no mistake.
Leave her alone!
Don't you be trying to stop the wretched creature!
Let her go and good riddance.
I never liked her from the moment she set foot in the door.
But who'll get stuck with the children? Me, that's who!
Her and her high and mighty ways.
And that face of her that would stop a coal barge, it would.
Indeed, Mrs Brill!
I wouldn't stay in this house another minute for all the jewels in Christendom.
No, Katie Nanna, don't go!
Stand away from that door!
What'll I tell the master about the children?
It's no concern of mine.
Those beasts ran away from me.
They must be somewhere.
Did you look around the zoo?
You think the lion got them?
They're fond of hanging around the cage.
I've said my say.
I've done with this house forever.
Hip, hip, hooray!
Don't stumble on the way out.
No, no, Katie Nanna!
Mrs Banks. She's home.
Our daughter's daughters will adore us
And we'll sing in grateful chorus
"Well done, Sister Suffragette"
Good evening,
Katie Nanna and Ellen.
The meeting was glorious!
Mrs Whitbourne-Allen chained herself to the prime minister's carriage.
You should have been there!
And Mrs Ainslie was carried off to prison.
Singing and scattering pamphlets all the way!
Madam, I've always given my best...
Thank you, Katie Nanna.
I knew you were one of us.
We're clearly soldiers in petticoats
And dauntless crusaders for women's votes
Though we adore men individually
We agree that as a group they're rather stupid
Mrs Banks...
Cast off the shackles of yesterday
Shoulder to shoulder into the fray
Our daughter's daughters will adore us
And they'll sing in grateful chorus
"Well done, Sister Suffragette"
I don't wish to offend, but...
From Kensington to Billingsgate
One hears the restless cries
From every corner of the land
Womankind, arise
Political equality and equal rights with men
Take heart, for Mrs Pankhurst has been clapped in irons again
No more the meek and mild subservients we
We're fighting for our rights militantly
Never you fear
If I may have a word...
So cast off the shackles of yesterday
Shoulder to shoulder into the fray
Our daughter's daughters will adore us
And they'll sing in grateful chorus
"Well done"
Mrs Banks!
"Well done"
Mrs Banks!
What is it, Katie Nanna?
I have something to say to you.
Where are the children?
The children, to be precise, are not here.
They've disappeared again.
That's really careless of you.
That's the third time this week.
The fourth, madam.
I've had my fill.
I'm not one to speak ill of the children.
When do you expect them home?
I couldn't say. If you'd compute my wages...
Oh, gracious! You're not leaving?
What will Mr Banks say?
He'll be cross when he finds the children missing.
Put these away. The cause infuriates Mr Banks.
I beseech you, please reconsider.
Think of the children.
Think of Mr Banks. He was just getting used to you.
Posts, everyone!
Fire!
- I do beseech you...
- My wages, if you please.
Bit early tonight, Admiral?
Nonsense. Bang on the dot, as usual.
How's the world of finance?
Never better.
Money's sound, credit rates are moving up,
- and the pound is admired everywhere.
- Good.
How about you?
Bit chancy, I'd say.
The Wind's up.
The glass is falling.
- Don't like it.
- Good. Good, good.
Banks, you're steering into a nasty piece of weather.
Banks!
Do you hear me?
Hello, Katie Nanna. That must be heavy. Allow me.
Hmph!
What a very pretty hat.
I feel a surge of deep satisfaction
Much as a king astride his noble steed
Thank you.
When I return from daily strife to hearth and wife
How pleasant is the life I lead
- Dear, the children...
- Yes, yes, yes.
I run my home precisely on schedule
At 6:01, I march through my door
My slippers, sherry, and pipe are due at 6:02
Consistent is the life I lead
George, they're missing.
Splendid, splendid.
It's grand to be an
Englishman in 1910
King Edward's on the throne It's the age of men
I'm the lord of my castle
The sovereign, the liege
I treat my subjects servants, children, wife
With a firm, but gentle hand Noblesse oblige
It's 6:03, and the heirs to my dominion are scrubbed and tubbed
And adequately fed
And so I'll pat them on the head and send them off to bed
Ah, lordly is the life I lead
Winifred, where are the children?
They're not here, dear.
Of course they're here.
Where else would they be?
- I don't know.
- You don't know?
They're missing. Katie Nanna has looked everywhere.
Very well. I'll deal with this at once.
The police station.
Quickly, please.
We needn't bother the police. The fact is...
Facts cloud the issue.
One fact alone is clear.
Katie Nanna's faltered.
She's disappointed us.
I shall bring her to book...
Oh.
- She's left us, hasn't she?
- Yes, only just.
George Banks here.
17 Cherry Tree Lane.
It's a matter of some urgency.
Please send a policeman.
The policeman's here, George.
What? Oh. Very prompt.
Wonderful service.
Thank you so much. Good night.
Come in, constable.
While on duty across the park,
I noted some stray valuables.
- I believe they're yours.
- Valuables?
Come along now.
Jane.
Michael.
Winifred, don't be emotional.
I wouldn't be too hard on them, sir.
They've had a long, weary walk today.
Children, come here at once.
Well?
- Sorry we lost Katie Nanna, Father.
- It was windy...
And the kite was too strong.
The kite ran away, sir, not the children.
Thank you. I'll manage this.
It wasn't a good kite.
We made it ourselves.
Perhaps if you helped us...
That's the ticket.
Kites are skittish things.
Only last week...
I'm very grateful to you, constable.
The cook will find you a plate of something.
I shall now return to my duties.
Thank you, constable.
Good night, miss. Good night, ma'am. Good night, sir.
"Cook will find something."
I'm awfully sorry about this, George.
You'll want to discuss it.
I would, indeed.
Ellen, take the children upstairs.
Yes, sir.
I knew it.
Who bears the brunt of everything?
Me, that's who.
They don't want an honest working girl here.
They need a ruddy zoo keeper.
Sorry.
When I chose Katie Nanna,
I thought she'd be firm.
She looked solemn, cross.
Never confuse efficiency with a liver complaint.
I'll do better next time.
Next time? You've engaged six nannies.
They've all been unqualified disasters.
I quite agree.
Choosing a nanny is a delicate task, requiring insight, balanced judgment, and an ability to read character.
Under the circumstances, it might be apropos to select the next person myself.
Would you, George?
I'll do this properly.
I'll advertise in The Times.
- Take this down, please.
- Yes, of course.
Wanted... No, required...
Nanny.
Firm, respectable, no-nonsense.
A British nanny must be a general
The future empire lies within her hands
And so the person that we need to mould the breed
It is a nanny who can give commands
- Getting this, Winifred?
- Yes, every word.
A British bank is run with precision
A British home requires nothing less
Tradition, discipline, and rules must be the tools
Without them disorder, catastrophe, anarchy
In short, you have a ghastly mess
Splendid, George. Inspirational.
The Times will be so pleased.
- Father.
- Yes?
We've discussed everything, and we're very sorry about today.
I should think so.
- It was wrong.
- Indeed.
We'll cooperate with the new nanny.
I'll be glad for your help.
That's why we wrote this advertisement.
Advertisement for what?
The new nanny.
- You wrote an...
- George, let's listen.
You wanted our help.
Oh, very well.
"Wanted, a nanny for two adorable children."
"Adorable." That's debatable, I must say.
"If you want this choice position
"Have a cheery disposition"
Jane, I don't...
"Rosy cheeks, no warts
I wrote that.
"Play games, all sorts
"You must be kind
"You must be witty
"Very sweet and fairly pretty"
- That's...
- George, please.
"Take us on outings, give us treats
"Sing songs, bring sweets
"Never be cross or cruel
"Never give us castor oil or gruel
"Love us as a son and daughter
"And never smell of barley water"
I wrote that, too.
"If you won't scold and dominate us
"We will never give you cause to hate us
"We won't hide your spectacles so you can't see
"Put toads in your bed or pepper in your tea
"Hurry, nanny
"Many thanks
"Sincerely
"Jane and Michael Banks"
Thank you. Most interesting.
We've had enough of this.
Please return to the nursery.
- They were only trying to help.
- I'm aware of that.
I congratulate myself on stepping in.
"Play games, sing songs, give treats." Ridiculous.
No question in my mind.
Now is the time for action.
The Times, please.
I don't know the number.
Oh, George, you're always so forceful.
The Times? George
Banks, Cherry Tree Lane.
I wish to place an advertisement.
- Time gun ready?
- Ready and charged, sir.
I'll take the report, Mr Binnacle.
Wind's coming from a new quarter.
So it is.
- Sir.
- What?
Something taking place off the port bow.
Ghastly looking crew, I must say.
There's a queue of nannies outside.
Shall I show them in?
I said 8:00, and 8:00 it shall be.
12 seconds to go.
- Posts!
It is now 8:00.
Yes, sir.
I have told you repeatedly, Ellen,
I dislike being hurried into things.
I don't understand.
They're nothing like what we advertised for.
Woof! Woof! Woof!
Michael, look!
- Perhaps it's a witch.
- Nonsense. Witches have brooms.
It's her. It's the person. She's answered our advertisement.
Rosy cheeks and everything.
- Show them in, one at a time.
- Yes, sir.
- Come in, one at a time.
- Thank you.
You are the father of
Jane and Michael Banks?
I said, you are the father of
Jane and Michael Banks?
Yes, of course.
You brought your references?
I never give references.
I believe it very old-fashioned.
We'll see about that then.
Now then, the qualifications.
Item one, "A cheery disposition."
I am never cross.
Item two, "Rosy cheeks."
Obviously.
Item three,
"Play games, all sorts."
They'll find my games extremely diverting.
Where did you get this paper?
I tore it up.
Excuse me.
Item four, "You must be kind."
I am kind, but extremely firm.
Have you lost something?
That paper. I thought that I...
You are George Banks?
And you did advertise for a nanny?
George Banks.
Very well, then.
Tore it up, turned it over, threw it in the...
Are you ill?
I hope not.
About my wages...
- The reference is obscure.
- Obscure.
We must be clear on that.
- I require every second Tuesday off.
- Every Tuesday.
Perhaps a trial period would be wise.
Hmm... I'll give you one week.
I'll know by then.
I'll see the children now.
Close your mouth.
We are not codfish.
Don't stand there.
Best foot forward.
Spit spot.
George?
- Aah!
I thought you were interviewing nannies.
I was, I was.
You've selected one already?
Yes, it's done.
- Where is she?
- In the nursery.
- I put her to work straight-away.
- How clever.
I'd have muddled everything.
Is she everything that we hoped she'd be?
It all happened rather quickly.
I mean, I... I, uh...
Will she be firm and give commands?
Will she mould our young breed?
Winifred, I think she will.
I think she Will!
In that case, perhaps Ellen should dismiss the others.
The others?
- Ellen!
- Yes, sir?
Tell the others the position's been filled.
- The others, sir?
- Yes, the others.
How many nannies does this house need?
The position has been filled.
I'm afraid the nursery isn't very tidy.
Rather like a bear pit.
- That's a funny bag.
- Carpet.
- To carry carpets?
- No, made of.
Your room has a lovely view.
Hmm...
It's not exactly
Buckingham Palace...
Still, it's clean.
Yes, it will be quite suitable.
Just needs a touch here and there.
First things first.
The place to hang a hat is on a hat stand.
Oh!
This will never do.
I much prefer seeing all of my face at once.
But there was nothing in it.
Never judge things by their appearance, even carpetbags.
I never do.
"A thing of beauty is a joy forever."
Hmm... A little more light perhaps.
We'd better watch this one.
- She's tricky.
- She's wonderful.
Much better.
Now, let me see.
That's funny. I always carry it.
It must be here somewhere.
- What?
- My tape measure.
- What for?
- To see how you measure up.
That's the funniest thing I ever saw.
Ah ha ha ha. Here it is.
Good.
Come along, then. Quickly.
Head up, Michael. Don't slouch.
Just as I thought. "Extremely stubborn and suspicious."
- I am not.
- See for yourself.
- "Extremely stubborn and susips..."
- Suspicious.
Now you, Jane.
"Rather inclined to giggle.
Doesn't put things away."
How about you?
Very well. Hold this for me.
As I expected.
"Mary Poppins, practically perfect in every way."
Mary Poppins.
Is that your name? It's lovely.
I've always liked it.
Shall we move?
In your advertisement, did you not request games?
Yes.
First we'll play
"Well Begun Is Half Done."
That sounds suspicious.
Otherwise entitled,
"Let's Tidy Up The Nursery."
I told you she was tricky.
Shall we begin?
It is a game, isn't it?
Depends on your viewpoint.
You see, in every job that must be done, there is an element of fun.
You find the fun, and snap, the job's a game.
And every task you undertake
becomes a piece of cake
A lark, a spree
It's very clear to see
That a
spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down
The medicine go down
Medicine go down
Just a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down
In a most delightful way
A robin feathering his nest has very little time to rest
While gathering his bits of twine and twig
Though quite intent in his pursuit
He has a merry tune to toot
He knows a song
Will move the job along
For a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down
The medicine go down
Medicine go down
Just a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down
In a most delightful way
The honeybees that fetch the nectar from the flowers to the comb
Never tire of ever buzzing to and fro
Because they take a little nip from every flower that they sip
And hence
And hence
They find
They find
Their task is not a grind
Their task is not a grind
Aaah
Cheeky.
Don't be all day.
Let me out! Let me out!
Let me out!
Well...
Thank you now.
When you've quite finished!
Thank you.
That's quite sufficient.
Hats and coats, please.
It's time for our outing.
Let's tidy up the nursery again.
Enough's as good as a feast.
You're not as well turned out as I'd like.
Still, there's time.
Spit Spot.
And off we go!
For a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down
The medicine go down
Medicine go down
Just a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down
In the most delightful way

What I do
Hello, art lovers.
Today I'm a screever
And as you can see
A screever's an artist
Of highest degree
And it's all me own work from me own memory
Not Royal Academy.
Still, they're not bad, are they?

Wait!
Don't move.
Don't move a muscle.
Stay right where you are.
I'd know that silhouette anywhere.
- Mary Poppins!
- Hello, Bert.
You know Jane and Michael.
Well, I've seen them here and about.
Chasing a kite last time, weren't it?
We're going to the park.
To the park?
Not if I know Mary Poppins.
Other nannies go to the park.
When you're with Mary Poppins, quick as you can say,
"Bob's your uncle," the most unusual things happen.
What are you talking about?
It's not my place to say, but she probably has in mind a jolly holiday.
Something along these lines.
That's always good. Here we go.
How about a lovely circus?
Lions and tigers.
World famous artistes performing death-defying feats of dexterity and skill.
Ta-da!
Ta-da!
Oh, that's lovely.
I'd much rather go there.
A typical English countryside done by a loving hand.
Though you can't see it, there's a little country fair down that road.
I don't see any road.
What? No road?
Just wants a bit of something here and a bit of something there.
There.
A country road suitable for travel and high adventure.
May we go, Mary Poppins, please?
Don't you think it's lovely,
Mary Poppins?
Now's the time. No one's looking.
Oh, please. Please.
I have no intention of making a spectacle of myself.
All right. I'll do it myself.
Do what?
Bit of magic.
- Magic?
- It's easy.
Let's see.
You think.
You wink.
You do a double blink.
You close your eyes and jump.
Is something supposed to happen?
Bert, what utter nonsense.
Oh.
Why do you complicate things?
Give me your hand, Michael.
Don't slouch.
Mary Poppins, you look beautiful.
- Do you really think so?
- Cross my heart, you do.
You look fine, too, Bert.
Isn't there a fair?
Down the road and behind the hill.
I hear the merry-go-round.
- Tell them hello.
- Don't smudge the drawing.
Ain't it a glorious day
Right as a mornin' in May
I feel like I could fly
Now, Bert, none of your larking about.
Have you ever seen the grass so green
Or a bluer sky
Oh, it's a jolly holiday with Mary
Mary makes your heart so light
You haven't changed.
When the day is grey and ordinary
Mary makes the sun shine bright
Oh, honestly.
Oh, happiness is bloomin' all around her
The daffodils are smiling at the dove
When Mary holds your hand
You feel so grand
Your heart starts beatin' like a big brass band
You are light-headed.
It's a jolly holiday with Mary
No wonder that it's
Mary that we love
Oh, it's a jolly holiday with Mary
Mary makes your heart so light
When the day is grey and ordinary
Mary makes the sun shine bright
Oh, happiness is bloomin' all around her
The daffodils are smiling at the dove, oink, oink
When Mary holds your hand
You feel so grand
Your heart starts beatin' like a big brass band
It's a jolly holiday with Mary
No wonder that it's
Mary that we love
Thank you.
Our pleasure, Mary Poppins.
Oh, it's a jolly holiday with you, Bert
Gentlemen like you are few
A vanishing breed.
Though you're just a diamond in the rough, Bert
Underneath your blood is blue
Common knowledge.
You'd never think of pressing your advantage
Forbearance is the hallmark of your creed
A lady needn't fear when you are near
Your sweet gentility is crystal clear
Oh, it's a jolly holiday with you, Bert
A jolly, jolly holiday with you
Waiter! Waiter?
Now then, what would be nice?
We'll start with raspberry ice
And then some cakes and tea
Order what you will
There'll be no bill
It's complimentary
You're very kind.
Anything for you, Mary Poppins.
You're our favourite person.
Right you are.
It's true that...
Mavis and Sybil have ways that are winning
And Prudence and Gwendolyn set your heart spinnin'
Phoebe's delightful
Maude is disarming
Felicia, Janice and Lydia
Charming!
Cynthia's dashing, Vivian's sweet
Stephanie's smashing,
Priscilla a treat
Veronica, Millicent,
Agnes, and Jane
Convivial company, time and again
Dorcas and Phyllis and Glynis are sorts
I'll agree are three jolly good sports
But cream of the crop, tip of the top is Mary Poppins and there we stop
When Mary holds your hand
You feel so grand
Your heart starts beatin' like a big brass band
Woo!
It's a jolly holiday with Mary
No wonder that it's
Mary that we love
No wonder that it's
Mary that we love
No wonder that it's
Mary that we love
Yahoo!
Yahoo!
Yahoo! Yahoo!
Our own private merry-go-round.
Nice. Very nice, indeed, if you don't want to go nowhere.
Who says we're not going anywhere?
Oh, guard!
Righto, Mary Poppins.
Thank you.
They're off!
Mary Poppins leads by two lengths, Jane's second by...
My horse is the fastest.
Hear that, mate?
Want to put up with that?
Is that the best you can do?
Hurry up, boy!
Not so fast, please. Michael.
Bert, you're just as bad.
Sorry. Whoa, boy. Whoa.
Easy, boy. Whoa. Whoa.
Just a bit of high spirits,
Mary Poppins.
Please control yourself.
We're not on a racecourse.
Follow me, please.
- Good morning.
- Oh, yes, quite. What?
I say.
Have you...
Ever?
Never!
View halloo.
Oh, yes, definitely. A view halloo.
View halloo?
Faith and Begorra.
'Tis them redcoats again.
Oh, musha, musha.
Poor little bloke.
Let's give him a hand.
Saints preserve us.
Yikes!
Tally ho! Da-doo da-doo!
Up you go. Now hang on.
Would you look at this?
An elegant merry-go-round horse.
Come on, you dirty omadhauns.
I'll lick all of you.
Faster, me beauty. Faster!
Riders, would you be kind and let me pass?
Certainly, ma'am.
- Thank you.
- Not at all, ma'am.
Excellent time, gentlemen.
- Quite.
- Perfect day for it.
Ahem.
Oh, how nice.
Hooray! Yay! Yay!
Hold still. Watch the dickie bird.
- How does it feel to win?
- Well...
- Gaining fame and fortune.
- Yes.
- Your picture in the newspaper.
- Actually...
Extreme good looks, may I say?
No words describe your emotion?
Gentlemen, on the contrary, there's a very good word.
- Right?
- Tell them.
Right.
It's supercalifragilisticexpialidocious

Me father gave me nose a tweak and told me I was bad
But then one day I learnt a word that saved me aching nose
The biggest word you ever heard and this is how it goes

Stay close now.
Oh, Bert, all your fine drawings.
There's more where they came from.

- Bye-bye.

No, I won't take your nasty medicine!
Do we have to, Mary Poppins?
People with wet feet must take their medicine.
I don't want it.
Oh!
Lime cordial! Delicious!
Strawberry! Mmm!
Rum punch.
Quite satisfactory.
You won't ever leave us, will you?
Do you have a handkerchief?
Will you stay if we're good?
A pie crust promise.
Easily made, easily broken.
Whatever would we do without you?
I'll stay until the wind changes.
How long will that be?
It's time to go to sleep.
We couldn't possibly go to sleep.
So many lovely things happened today!
Did they?
We jumped into Bert's picture.
The horses fled the carousel.
And we went riding!
Tally ho! Tchunga!
Tally ho! Yoicks!
Really?
Don't you remember?
You won the race.
A respectable person like me?
How dare you.
I saw you do it.
Another word and I'll summon a policeman.
I saw it happen!
- Go to sleep.
- I don't want to.
We're much too excited.
Very well. Suit yourselves.
Stay awake
Don't rest your head
Don't lie down
Upon your bed
While the moon
Drifts in the skies
Stay awake
Don't close
Your eyes
Though the world
Is fast asleep
Though your pillow's
Soft and deep
You're not sleepy
As you seem
Stay awake
Don't nod and dream
Stay awake
Don't nod
And dream
Glorious day,
Mr Binnacle, glorious.
Nobody sleeps this morning.
Put in double powder.
A double charge? Aye, sir.
Shake things up a bit, what?
- Lovely, lovely morning, Ellen.
- Indeed it is, ma'am.
- You packed the spoiled eggs?
- Yes.
After our meeting, we're all going to throw things at the prime minister.
How distinguished you look today.
What's all that fearful caterwauling?
It's cook singing.
- What's wrong with her?
- She's happy as a cricket.
Since you hired Mary Poppins, the most extraordinary thing has come over the household.
- Ellen hasn't broken a dish all morning.
- That is extraordinary.
She and cook fight like cats and dogs, but today...
- I'll hold the door.
- Thanks ever so.
Ellen, stop making that offensive noise.
And shut the window. That bird's giving me a headache.
Yes, sir.
Quiet! You're giving the master a headache.
I'm sorry you're unwell.
Who said I'm unwell?
I just don't understand why everyone's so confoundedly cheerful.
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
How lovely. Thank you, my darling.

Stop, stop, stop!
- Good morning, Father.
- Morning.
Mary Poppins taught us...
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
What are you talking about?
Supercali...
Whatever it is.
It's something to say when you don't know what to say.
Yes, well, I always know what to say.
- Yes, hurry along, please.
- Yes, Father.
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
Winifred, will you explain this unseemly hullabaloo?
I don't think there's anything to explain.
The children just came in to make you feel better.
I should like to be quite clear.
I am not out of sorts. I'm in a perfectly equable mood.
I do not require being made to feel better!
You're always saying you want a cheerful and pleasant household.
I should like to make a differentiation between cheerful and...
Excuse me, dear.
Posts, everyone, please!
I have no objection to cheerfulness.
I expect certain decorum.
I don't propose standing idly by and letting Poppins undermine the discipline...
There's something extremely odd about this household since that woman arrived, and I've noticed it.
Yes, dear.
One thing more.
Yes, dear?
Have this piano repaired.
I like to have it in tune.
But, George, you don't play.
That is entirely beside the point!
Now, let me see.
We must go to the piano tuners, then to Mrs Cory's shop for some gingerbread, then to the fishmonger's for dover sole and prawns.
Michael, stop stravaging along behind.
Ahoy, there!
Ahoy!
- Good day to you.
- Good morning, Admiral.
What fine adventure are we off upon today?
Going to fight the Hottentots?
Dig for buried treasure?
We're going to buy fish.
Very good. Proceed at flank speed.
Aye, aye, sir.
Let's put our backs into it.
More spit and polish.
That's what's wanted.
Andrew.
Woof! Woof! Woof!
Woof! Woof! Woof!
Slow down. I can't understand a word.
Woof! Woof! Woof!
Again?
The poor man.
Woof! Woof! Woof!
Woof! Ah-choo!
Bless you.
Woof! Woof! Woof!
Why, yes, certainly.
I'll go straight-away.
- Thank you very much.
- Woof!
- What did he say?
- "You're welcome."
- And?
- He didn't say anything.
You know best.
I thought we were buying fish.
There's been a change of plans.
Come along, please.
Don't straggle.
Andrew, worrying won't help anyone.
You should go home and rest.
Woof!
- Bert, I'm glad you're here.
- I came right away.
How is he?
He's never been worse.
How about them?
It's contagious, you know.
- We'll get spots?
- Unlikely.
Ohh! Hoo hoo hoo!
Oh, Uncle Albert.
Bless my soul.
It's Mary Poppins.
I'm delight... Ha-ha!
I'm delighted to see you.
Uncle Albert, you promised.
Ha-ha! I know.
I tried, really, I did. I... Ho ho!
But I so enjoy laughing. Ah ha ha!
When I start, it's up with...
Ha ha ha!
That's what happens.
I love to laugh! Ah ho ho!
Oh, my! I can't help it.
Ha ha ha!
I just like laughing.
Ha ha! Ha ha!
Don't you dare.
You'll only make him worse.
- It's quite serious.
- Keep a straight face.
Last time, we took three days to get him down.
I love to laugh
Hoo hoo hoo hoo!
Loud and long and clear
Ha!
I love to laugh
Ha ha ha ha!
It's getting worse every year
Ha ha ha!
The more I laugh
Ho ho ho!
The more I fill with glee
You're no help!
The more the glee
Ha ha ha ha!
The more I'm a merrier me
Hoo hoo hoo!
It's embarrassing.
The more I'm a merrier me
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha ha!
Some people laugh through their noses
Sounding something like this
Mmm-hmm hmm hmm!
Dreadful.
Sss-sss-sss!
Some people laugh through their teeth Goodness sakes
Hissing and fizzing like snakes
Sss sss sss!
Not at all attractive.
Some laugh too fast
Hee hee hee hee!
Some only blast
Ha!
Others they twitter like birds
Hee hee hee hoo! Hee hee hee hoo!
You're as bad as he is.
Then there's that kind what can't make up their mind
Hmm hmm hmm, ha ha ha!
Hee hee hee, ho ho ho!
Hee ha ho huh?
When things strike me as funny
I can't hide it inside
And squeak, hee, as the squeakelers do
Ha ha ha!
I've got to let go
With a ho ho ho ho
Ha ha ha ha!
And a ho ho ho, hoo!
How nice!
I was hoping you'd turn up.
We always have a jolly time.
We love to laugh
Ha ha ha ha!
Loud and long and clear
Hoo hoo hoo!
We love to laugh
Ha ha ha ha!
So everybody can hear
Ha ha ha!
The more you laugh
Don't you start. Come back here.
We fill With glee
Hee hee hee!
And the more the glee
Ha ha ha ha!
The more we're a merrier we
Welcome, children. Welcome.
Make yourselves comfortable.
Pull up a chair.
I say, you're a sight.
Speaking of sight, it reminds me of me brother.
He works in a watch factory.
What's he do?
He stands about all day and makes faces.
Makes faces in a watch factory!
You made that up.
That's good.
Such behaviour.
It's disgraceful or my name isn't Mary Poppins.
I know a man with a wooden leg named Smith.
What's the name of his other leg?
Wasn't that funny?
What's the name of...
Children, it's tea time. I won't have schedule interruptions.
Please stay.
Look, I have tea ready for you.
And it's getting cold.
I had hoped that maybe you would...
Splendid! Thank you very much.
Mind the bread and butter.
Now watch, children.
I knew she'd do it... A proper tea.
I suppose you'll want me to pour.
If I must, I must.
But stop behaving like laughing hyenas.
- Two lumps, Uncle Albert?
- Yes, please.
- Bed?
- None for me.
I'm glad you came.
It wouldn't be fun otherwise.
Pour some milk for
Michael and yourself.
- Nice weather we're having.
- Yes.
The other day when it was cold, a friend bought long underwear.
The shopkeeper said,
"How long do you want it?"
My friend said,
"From September to March."
Jane! Control yourself!
Children, please sit up properly.
- Your tea, Uncle Albert.
- Thank you, dear.
I'm having fun.
I wish you could always stay here.
We'll have to. There's no way down.
Oh, there is a way.
I hate mentioning it because you must think of something sad.
Do it, please.
Let me see.
I've got the very thing.
Yesterday, when my neighbour answered the bell, a man was there.
The man said, "I'm terribly sorry.
I just ran over your cat."
- Oh, that's sad.
- The poor cat.
Then he said,
"I'll replace your cat."
She said, "Okay, but can you catch mice?"
I started out saying...
I try. Really, I do.
But everything ends up so hilarious. I can't...
I can't help...
That will be enough of that.
It's time to go home.
Oh, that is sad. Oh, no.
That's the saddest thing I ever heard.
Come along, children.
Must you really go?
People come to see me all the time, and we have such a lovely time.
Then they go home, and I'm very, very sad about it.
Don't worry. We'll return soon.
It was lovely.
- Keep an eye on him, Bert.
- I'll stay a while.
Thank you.
Uncle Albert,
I got a jolly joke I saved for just such an occasion.
- Want to hear it?
- I'd be so grateful.
Righto. It's about me granddad.
One night, he had a nightmare.
So scared he chewed his pillow to bits.
Next morning, I says,
"How do you feel?"
He says,
"A little down in the mouth."
There's nothing like a good joke.
No, and that's nothing like a good joke.
Bit late tonight, aren't you?
I say, Banks!
Is anything the matter, Banks?
Banks!
We're so glad you're home!
We had the most wonderful afternoon.
I know a man with a wooden leg named Smith.
We don't know anyone called Smith.
The second chap says,
"What's his other leg's name?"
And a party on the ceiling.
Children, be quiet.
Mary Poppins says we'll go again.
Oh?
Oh, Mary Poppins said that?
Please return to your room.
Mary Poppins, will you come with me?
As you wish.
Mary Poppins, I regret what I must say.
Good evening, George.
Is anything the matter?
I'm afraid so.
I have to dress for my rally.
- I'd rather you be present.
- Of course, George.
Mary Poppins, I confess
I'm disappointed in you.
She's for it.
I've heard this before.
I don't deny I'm partially responsible for allowing the children's worthless frivolity.
But they must learn the seriousness of life.
But they're only children.
In light of what's happened...
George, are you certain?
I believe I am.
A British bank is run with precision
A British home requires nothing less
Tradition, discipline, and rules must be the tools
Without them disorder, chaos, moral disintegration
In short, you have a ghastly mess
I quite agree.
The children must be moulded, shaped and taught
That life's a looming battle to be faced and fought
I'm disturbed to hear my children talking about popping into pictures, consorting with racehorse persons, fox hunting...
I don't mind that. It's tradition.
But parties on the ceiling?
Having tea parties on the ceiling?
And other highly questionable outings...
If they must go on outings
These outings ought to be fraught with purpose, yes, and practicality
These silly words like
Superca...
Super...
Supercal...
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.
Yes, well done.
And popping through pictures have little use, fulfill no basic need
They've got to learn the honest truth
Despite their youth
They must learn
About the life you lead
Exactly.
They must feel the thrill of totting up a balanced book
A thousand ciphers neatly in a row
Quite right.
When gazing at a graph that shows the profits up
Their little cup of joy should overflow
Precisely.
It's time they learnt to walk in your footsteps
My footsteps.
To tread your straight and narrow path with pride
With pride.
Tomorrow, just as you suggest
Pressed and dressed Jane and Michael will be at your side
Splendid! You've hit the nail...
At my side? Where are we going?
To the bank.
- The bank?
- Yes.
Tomorrow's an important day.
I'll see they have a proper night's sleep.
Did I say I'd take the children to the bank?
It sounded that way.
And why not?
Capital idea.
Just the medicine they need for all this sugary female thinking they get here.
Quite right. Good idea.
Quite right.
Mary Poppins, we won't let you go.
What do you mean?
Weren't you sacked?
Sacked? I am never sacked.
- Oh, Mary Poppins!
- Hooray!
Neither am I a maypole.
- But...
- Goats butt.
Birds fly.
Children going out with their father get some sleep.
An outing with Father?
He's never taken us on an outing.
He's never taken us anywhere.
How did you manage it?
You gave him the idea.
How impertinent!
Me giving ideas to people? Really.
- Where's he taking us?
- The bank.
Michael, the city! Father can point out the sights.
Most things he can.
Sometimes people, through no fault of their own, can't see past their nose.
Past their nose?
Yes. Sometimes a little thing is quite important.
Oh, look. The cathedral.
Father passes that every day.
Early each day to the steps of St. Paul's
The little old bird woman comes
In her own special way to the people she calls
Come buy my bags full of crumbs
Come feed the little birds
Show them you care
And you'll be glad if you do
Their young ones are hungry
Their nests are so bare
All it takes is tuppence
From you
Feed the birds
Tuppence a bag
Tuppence, tuppence
Tuppence a bag
Feed the birds
That's what she cries
While overhead, her birds fill the skies
All around the cathedral
The saints and apostles
Look down as she sells her wares
Although you can't see it
You know they are smiling
Each time someone shows
That he cares
Though her words are simple and few
Listen, listen
She's calling to you
Feed the birds
Tuppence a bag
Tuppence, tuppence
Tuppence a bag
Though her words are simple and few
Listen, listen
She's calling to you
Feed the birds
Tuppence a bag
Tuppence
Tuppence
Tuppence a bag
Now, remember. Be on your best behaviour.
Isn't it your bank?
As a younger officer, it is, sort of.
Michael, look.
It's her!
- Who? It's who?
- The bird woman.
Just like Mary Poppins said.
You see her?
Of course I can. Do you think
I can't see past the end of my nose?
Listen, she's saying it.
Feed the birds.
Tuppence a bag.
Of course she's saying it.
- May we feed the birds?
- Whatever for?
- I have tuppence.
- Just this once.
Waste your money on birds?
Certainly not.
But Mary Poppins...
I'm not interested in Mary
Poppins nor in hearing her name.
But it's my tuppence.
Michael, don't throw your money away!
At the bank, I'll show you what to do.
It's extremely interesting.
Hello, Banks.
What's all this about?
My children.
Why are they here?
They're opening an account, sir.
How much money do you have?
Tuppence. I want it to feed the birds.
Tuppence!
Tuppence...
Precisely how I started.
That's the elder Mr Dawes, a giant in the finance world.
A giant?
Father, these are Banks' children!
They want to open an account!
Do they, boy? Excellent. Excellent.
We can use more money to put to work for the bank.
You have tuppence?
May I be permitted to see it?
It's for feeding the birds.
Feed the birds and what have you got?
Fat birds!
But...
If you invest your tuppence wisely in the bank
Safe and sound
Soon that tuppence
Safely invested in the bank
Will compound
And you'll achieve that sense of conquest
As your affluence expands
In the hands of the directors
Who invest
As propriety demands
- May I, sir?
- Carry on, Banks.
You see, Michael, you'll be part of railways through Africa!
Exactly.
Dams across the Nile.
- Talk about the ships.
- Fleets of ocean greyhounds.
Tell them more.
Majestic self-amortizing canals.
It fires the imagination!
Plantations of ripening tea
All from
Tuppence
Prudently, thriftily, frugally invested in the...
To be specific
In the Dawes, Tomes,
Mousley, Grubbs
Fidelity Fiduciary bank
Give me the money, boy.
I want to feed the birds.
Banks!
Yes, sir. Now, Michael...
When you deposit tuppence in a bank account
Go on!
Soon you'll see
Tell him more!
That it blooms into credit of a generous amount
Semi-annually
And you'll achieve that sense of stature
As your influence expands
To the high financial strata
That established credit now commands
You can purchase first and second trust deeds.
Imagine the foreclosures, bonds, chattels, dividends, shares.
Bankruptcies.
Debtor sales.
Opportunities.
Private enterprise.
Shipyards.
- The mercantile.
- Collieries.
Tanneries.
Corporations, amalgamations.
Banks!
While stand the Banks of England,
England stands.
When fall the Banks of England,
England falls!
You see, Michael?
All for the lack of...
Tuppence
Patiently
Cautiously
Trustingly invested in the...
To be specific
In the Dawes, Tomes,
Mousley, Grubbs
Fidelity Fiduciary Bank
Welcome to our joyful family of investors.
Give it back!
Give it back!
Michael, behave...
Give it to him.
Give me back my money!
Give me back my money!
The bank won't give someone their money.
I'm getting mine.
Come along, every penny!
And give me mine, too.
Stop all payments.
Stop all payments.
Give me my money!
Children, come back!
- Stop those children!
- Jane! Michael!
Come on!
Stop those children!
Stop those children!
Aah!
Come with me.
Granny will hide you!
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
Here, half a mo.
Leave my sister alone.
Your friend won't hurt you.
Bert, it's you.
In the flesh and at your service.
You're filthy.
Perhaps a smudge.
It so happens today
I'm a chimney sweep.
Oh, Bert, we're so frightened.
Don't take on so.
Bert will take care of you.
Like I was your own father.
Who's after you?
Father.
What?
We went to his bank.
We must have done something dreadful.
The police and army were after us.
Michael, don't exaggerate.
There must be some mistake.
Your dad loves you.
No, not with the look he had on his face.
He doesn't like us.
That don't seem likely, does it?
It's true.
Let's sit down.
Begging your pardon, but my heart goes out to your father.
There he is in that cold, heartless bank, hemmed in by mounds of cold, heartless money.
I don't like seeing living things caged up.
Father in a cage?
Cages come in all sizes and shapes, even bank-shaped.
Father's not in trouble, we are.
Sure about that, are you?
You've got your mother to look after you, and Mary Poppins and
Constable Jones and me.
Who looks after your father?
When something happens, what does he do?
Fends for himself, he does.
Who does he tell?
No one.
Don't blab his troubles.
He pushes on at his job, uncomplaining, alone, and silent.
He's not very silent.
Michael, be quiet.
Bert, does Father really need our help?
It's not my place to say.
But fathers can always do with a bit of help.
I'll take you home.

Ellen, whoever that is, send them away.
I'm dreadfully late.
Yes, mum.
I'll be leaving.
Please stay till Father comes home!
Father will feel better if you shake hands with him.
It's the children, mum.
I thought they were with their father.
You haven't been running off, have you?
They haven't exactly been running away, mum.
They've been frightened and should be looked after.
Oh, of course,
Mary Poppins will...
Oh, no, it's her day off.
Ellen, would you...
No, mum. I haven't done me brasses.
Ask Mrs Brill...
Not for 100 quid.
It's baking day, and you know how cook is.
What about you, sir?
You've been so kind.
Me, mum?
Lord mayor's got a stopped-up chimney.
How clever of you to know.
Our drawing room chimney is in the most ghastly condition.
Thank you so much.
Besides, it will amuse the children.
The lord mayor's going to be terrible put out.
Thank you so much.
I do appreciate it.
I must hurry.
Our gallant ladies in prison are waiting for me to lead them in song.
Good-bye, my darlings.
I choose me bristles with pride, yes, I do
A broom for the shaft
And a brush for the flue
It's awfully dark and gloomy up there.
You see how wrong people can be?
That's a doorway to a place of enchantment.
Up where the smoke is all billowed and curled
'Tween pavement and stars
Is the chimney sweep world
When there's hardly no day
Nor hardly no night
There's things half in shadow
And halfway in light
On the rooftops of London
Coo, what a sight
I wish we could go up there.
I like chimneys.
Rightly so. A chimney is a wondrous thing.
It's built tall up there on the roof.
The wind blows across her top and draws the smoke right up the flue.
Feel the pull on the end of that brush.
It's like you've got a whale at the end of the line, isn't it?
Michael, be careful.
Things happen around fireplaces.
Oh, bother.
Michael!
Michael, come back down here!
Michael, Michael, where are you?
That's a bit awkward.
Stop putting ideas in their heads.
There goes another one.
Shall I go after them?
They can't gallivant up there like kangaroos.
Michael, everything's going to be...
Will you put your things on?
Hurry up. Spit spot.
Thought you'd left.
We didn't mean to.
No harm done.
Truth is, this is a fortuitous circumstance.
Look there.
A trackless jungle just waiting to be explored.
Why not, Mary Poppins?
Oh, please, Mary Poppins.
Oh, well... If we must, we must.
Fall in.
Look lively. Look lively.
Jump to it. Get in line.
Attention!
Slope arms!
Right turn!
Quick march!
Hello there!
It's just good clean soot, Michael.
Far as we go, right?
Not at all.
What did I tell you?
The world's at your feet, and who sees it but the birds, the stars, and the chimney sweeps?
Quite nice, but we've had enough night air. Follow me, please.

Good luck, guv'nor.
Lovely time.
Had an elegant time, guv'nor.
Good luck, guv'nor.
Father, every sweep shook your hand.
You'll be so lucky!
Come along, children. Spit spot.
One moment, Mary Poppins.
What's the meaning of this?
I beg your pardon?
Will you explain all this?
I'd like to make one thing clear.
Yes.
I never explain anything.
Yes? Banks here.
Mr Dawes...
I'm dreadfully sorry about what happened today.
I can assure you that...
Tonight, sir?
Yes. We'll expect you at 9:00 precisely.
Without fail.
Without fail.
Why, yes, Banks.
It's extremely serious.
We regret this action.
We regret this action.
You've been with us many years...
You've been with us many years...
As was your father.
As was your father.
Yes, Mr Dawes.
I shall be there at 9:00.
A man has dreams of walking with giants.
To carve his niche in the edifice of time.
Before the mortar of his zeal
Has a chance to congeal
The cup's dashed from his lips.
The flame's snuffed aborning.
He's brought to wrack and ruin in his prime.
Life's a rum go, guv'nor.
That's the truth.
I think it's Mary Poppins.
Since she's come, things have happened to me.
Mary Poppins?
Yes, of course!
My world was calm
Well ordered...
Exemplary.
Then came this person
With chaos in her wake
And now my life's ambitions go
With one fell blow
It's quite a bitter pill
To take
That Poppins woman did it!
I know the person... Mary Poppins.
She's the one what sings...
A spoonful of sugar
That is all it takes
It changes bread and water into
Tea and cakes
That's it exactly!
Changing bread into cakes, indeed.
No wonder everything's higgledy-piggledy.
A spoonful of sugar
Goes a long, long way
Have yourself a healthy helpin'
Every day
A healthy helpin' of trouble.
You know what she did?
I realise it now. She tricked me into taking Jane and
Michael to the bank.
That's how the trouble started.
Tricked you into that?
Outrageous!
A man as important as you?
Shameful!
You're a man of high position, esteemed by your peers.
And when your little tykes are cryin'
You haven't time to dry their tears
And see them grateful little faces
Smilin' up at you
Because their dad
He always knows just what to do
I mean, look...
Like you say, guv'nor...
You've got to grind, grind, grind
At that grindstone
Though childhood slips
Like sand
Through a sieve
And all too soon
They've up and grown
And then they've flown
And it's too late for you to give
Just that spoonful of sugar
To help the medicine
Go down
The medicine go down
Medicine go down
Well, goodbye, guv'nor.
Sorry to have troubled you.
Father.
We're sorry about the tuppence.
We didn't know it would cause you so much trouble.
Here, Father. You can have the tuppence.
Will that make everything all right?
Thank you.
Come in!
Take your hat off, Banks.
Good evening, gentlemen.
Get on with it. Go on.
Yes, Father.
In 1773, an official of this bank unwisely loaned a large sum of money to finance a shipment of tea to the American colonies.
Do you know what happened?
I do. As the ship lay in Boston Harbour, colonists dressed as Red Indians boarded, behaved rudely, and threw the tea overboard.
This made the tea unsuitable for drinking, even for Americans.
Precisely.
The loan was defaulted.
Panic ensued within these walls.
There was a run on the bank.
From that time to this, there has not been a run on this bank.
Until today!
A run, sir, caused by the disgraceful conduct of your son.
Do you deny it?
No, sir.
I shall gladly assume responsibility for my son.
Why are you waiting?
Get on with it.
Yes, Father.
No, not that!
Steady on.
Do you have anything to say?
Sir, they do say that when there's nothing to say, all you can say...
Confound it, Banks!
Do you have anything to say?
Just one word, sir.
Yes?
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.
What?
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.
Mary Poppins was right.
It does make you feel better.
There's no such word.
It is a perfectly good word.
Do you know what there's no such thing as?
With due respect, there's no such thing as you!
Impertinence, sir!
Would you like to hear a marvellous joke?
A real snapper.
Joke? Snapper?
Jane and Michael meet one day on the street.
Jane says, "I know a man with a wooden leg named Smith."
Michael says, "What's the name of his other leg?"
The man's gone mad.
Call the guard!
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.
I'm feeling better!
Don't strike my father!
There's the tuppence, the wonderful, fateful, supercalifragilisticexpialidocious tuppence.
Guard it well. Good-bye!
Where are you going?
I might pop through a chalk pavement picture or seize a horse off a merry-go-round or fly a kite.
Only Poppins knows.
- Poppins?
- My nanny.
She sings that ridiculous song.
A spoonful of sugar
Makes the medicine go down
The medicine go down
The medicine go down
The medicine...
Mad as a March hare.
A wooden leg named Smith.
A wooden leg named Smith.
A wooden le...
Father.
Father!
Father, come down!
Daddy!
Daddy, come back!
Wind's come around, blowing dead on from the west.
She doesn't care what happens to us.
She only promised to stay till the wind changed, right?
Bring my hat stand, please.
Mary Poppins, don't you love us?
What would happen to me if I loved all the children
I said goodbye to?
That's right. George W. Banks,
17 Cherry Tree Lane.
About 6'1", I'd say.
Yes, we rang up his bank first thing.
We discovered he'd been discharged last night.
No telling what he'll do in a fit of despondency.
Wouldn't hurt to drag the river.
There's a spot popular with jumpers.
Really, Ellen!
He seemed to have been a fine, stable gentleman.
No hanky-panky.
Regular habits, as far as anyone knows.
The medicine go down
Just a spoonful...
It's him!
Or something similar.
A little less noise on the premises.
I can't understand the inspector.
Just a spoonful of sugar
Makes the medicine go down
You didn't jump in the river.
How sensible of you.
It's all right, sir.
He's been found.
No, alive, or so I presume.
He's kissing Mrs Banks.
What happened at the bank?
I've been sacked, flung into the street.
A spoonful of sugar
Makes the medicine go down
Gone off his crumpet, that's what he's done.
Dotty as you please.
What were you doing in the cellar?
First, where are the children?
Jane! Michael!
Your father's calling.
It doesn't sound like Father.
Jane! Michael!
Run along. Spit spot.
You won't go,
Mary Poppins, will you?
Spit Spot.
He mended it!
It's wonderful!
However did you manage it?
With tuppence for paper and strings
You can have your own set of wings
With your feet on the ground
You're a bird in flight
With your fist holding tight
To the string of your kite
Oh, oh, oh
Let's go fly a kite
Up to the highest height
Let's go fly a kite
And send it soaring
Up through the atmosphere
Up where the air is clear
Oh, let's go fly a kite
A proper kite needs a proper tail.
That's what I said.
Go fly a kite.
No, sir. I don't mean you personally.
Let's go fly a kite
Up to the highest height
Let's go fly a kite
And send it soaring
Up through the atmosphere
Up where the air is clear
Oh, let's go fly a kite
When you send it flying up there
All at once you're lighter than air
You can dance on the breeze
Over houses and trees
With your fist holding tight
To the string of your kite
Oh, oh, oh
Let's go fly a kite
Up to the highest height
Let's go fly a kite
And send it soaring
There you are, Banks.
Congratulations.
Capital bit of humour.
"Wooden leg named Smith," or Jones, whatever it was.
Father died laughing.
Oh, I'm so sorry, sir.
Nonsense. Nothing to be sorry about.
Never seen him happier.
He left an opening for a new partner.
Congratulations.
Thank you very much indeed, sir.
Up through the atmosphere
Up where the air is clear
Oh, let's go
Fly a kite
Awk! That's gratitude for you.
Didn't even say goodbye.
No, they didn't.
Look at them.
They think more of their father than of you.
That's as it should be.
Don't you care?
Practically perfect people never permit sentiment to muddle their thinking.
Is that so?
Mary Poppins, you don't fool me.
Really?
Really. I know how you feel.
If you think I'm keeping my mouth shut...
That will be quite enough, thank you.
Goodbye, Mary Poppins.
Don't stay away too long.
Oh, oh, oh
Let's go fly a kite
Up to the highest height
Let's go fly a kite
And send it soaring
Up through the atmosphere
Up where the air is clear
Oh, let's go
Fly a kite

[Trombone solo]
[trumpet solo]
- hey, counselor, you're a pisces, right?
- Right.
- Okay, then you got to watch your step today on account of the moon being in Virgo and squared with Jupiter.
See, it says right here.
"Pisces be careful of vital decisions today."
- Okay, melody,
I'll try and be careful.
- It--it also says, "this is a good time to take stock of your worldly possessions."
- Yeah?
Okay, uh, one saxophone, one suitcase, one set of law books,
2 bucks and 28 cents cash.
Oh, by the way, does it say anything in there about our back pay?
- Oh, look, as soon as I sell the bus,
I'll pay every man every dime I owe him.
- I know you will, melody.
All I'm saying is, uh, we're not exactly collegians anymore.
The years are piling up, and, uh...
What's to show for it?
- We'll get something on radio.
That's the big thing today--radio.
I've got connections in Chicago.
- Yeah.
You know something, melody?
The first honest job somebody offers me,
I'm gonna take it.
- What do you mean,
"honest job"?
- I mean, it's time
I got off this merry-go-round and put down roots somewhere.
- Roots.
Every time you start studying that lawyer course, you start putting roots down again.
[Band continues playing]
[cheering]
- Hey, what are we stopping here for?
- All right, boys, take ten.
We got to get to Chicago before dark.
- What's the big hurry?
- We haven't got a taillight.
Come on, everybody out.
[Overlapping chatter]
- [Chuckling]
Ah.
Oh, look, natives.
You got any beads?
- Well, I got, uh, exactly 20 cents.
- Come on,
I'll buy you a soda.
Oh, goody, a phosphate shop.
- [Inhales deeply]
Mmm, fresh air.
- Who needs it?
- What a great little town.
- Are you kidding?
- Hey, melody, look...
An electric.
- Very quaint.
- I haven't seen one of those in years.
[Boys shouting]
- Is that clear, Ralph?
- Aunt Hetty, we're trying to be a bank, not a charitable institution.
We can't refuse to foreclose a mortgage simply because Mrs. Todd is a good Christian woman.
- But she is.
Give her two more months, Ralph.
- Yes, aunt Hetty.
- And stop biting your fingernails.
- Yes, aunt Hetty.
- Let's go, babe!
Let's go!
- Aunt Hetty!
You forgot your purse.
- I always do it, don't I?
Forget my purse and upset Ralph.
- [Laughs]
[Horn honks]
[Engine puttering]
[Horn honks]
- Oh!
- I got it!
- Oh!
Would you mind?
You're standing on my foot.
- Oh, oh, I'm sorry.
- Oh!
- Come on!
They're coming in!
- Don't run home!
- Out! Out!
- They ought to stop playing ball in the street.
Are you all right, dear?
- Yes.
- Are you sure, miss downey?
- Oh, yes, I'm fine.
Thank you.
- They ought to have better sense.
- They most certainly ought to.
- I'm awfully sorry.
Uh, maybe you better not walk on that.
It might be sprained or something.
- No, it's only bruised a little.
- It really must have hurt.
I weigh 196 minus shoes.
By the way, if you should want to sue, my name is Lem siddons.
Maybe I'd better carry you.
- No, I think not.
Thank you, Mr. siddons.
- You're welcome, miss downey.
- Vida, what happened?
[Overlapping chatter]
[Air hissing]
- I'm telling you--
[Trumpet blares]
Give me that trumpet.
Don't you realize those instruments cost a lot of money?
Now, come on.
[Air hissing]
Get away from those tires!
Now, look, you small-time roughnecks,
I'm gonna take the lot of you and dust you good.
- All of us, mister?
- Yes, all of you.
[Overlapping shouting]
- Okay, guys, we give up.
Melody, we're gonna have to use a little, uh, psychology around here.
- What kind of psychology?
- [Chuckles]
Go buy yourself some licorice whips, huh?
Here's two bits.
[Boys shouting]
Two-bit psychology, melody-- a very generous gesture for a man in my financial condition.
- It wasn't wasted.
- Hmm?
- Hey, Lem?
Lem, come on.
Let's go.
Boys, would you hang that up on the, uh, bracket up there?
Hey, Lem, look.
"You know, melody," he says,
"the first honest job someone offers me,
I'm gonna take."
Selling candy to kids-- what could be more honest?
You want roots?
A place like this, you could grow yourself down to China.
All right, Charlie, let's get moving.
Now, now, boys, we got a long trip, a long trip-- settle down, settle down.
What are you doing, Lem?
Lem. Lem!
I think I know what you're doing, and you can't do it.
Lem, honest jobs aren't for musicians.
- Melody, uh, give me my law book.
- Look, look, Lem,
I was only kidding.
I was only kidding.
You can't live in a hick town like this.
- Melody, it's been a real pleasure working with you.
Take off, Charlie.
- Lem, the moon is in Virgo and squared with Jupiter!
- Okay, melody,
I'll remember that!
So long!
- So long, Lem!
Good luck!
[Door opens, bell jingling]
- Thanks, mister!
- Okay, fellas.
- Thank you.
- You bet.
- You got two pieces, and I only got one.
[Overlapping chatter]
- All right.
[Bell jingling]
How do you do, sir?
[Bell jingles]
My name's Lem siddons.
I'm out of Chicago, lakeside high, and the United States army.
Since then, for eight years,
I've been blowing a saxophone and studying law on the side.
Now I've decided I'd like to settle down someplace, and, uh, well, I think this is it.
I could be a crackerjack salesman, or I could sweep the place out.
- You can work up to salesman later.
- Thank you.
- How about money?
- Oh, you name it, sir.
- $25 and a free go at the candy counter.
- You've got a deal, mister, uh...
- Uh, Hughes.
- Okay, Mr. Hughes,
I'm your boy.
- All right.
Stand right there.
Come on, Arthur.
- Well,
I guess that takes care of the moon and Virgo squared with Jupiter.
- Four, five, six bananas...
And, uh, two licorice whips.
- Thanks a lot.
- Thanks, Lem.
Don't forget, you're in the ball game at lunch, Lem.
- I'll be there, hoodoo.
- Hi, Mrs. seibert.
- Hello, boys.
- Good morning, Hetty.
- Good morning, John.
- Good morning,
Mrs. seibert.
- Oh, good morning...
Lemuel?
- That's right.
- Oh. Isn't that remarkable?
I remembered his name.
Are you getting settled in hickory, lemuel?
- Oh, he's found
Artie's pool parlor and has joined the methodist church.
- Fine...
About the church, I mean.
But don't drink any of Artie's bootlegged whiskey.
- [Chuckles] Never touch the stuff, Mrs. seibert.
- Good.
Now, what did
I come in here for?
I know I'm in here for some reason.
- Maybe I can help you,
Mrs. seibert.
Uh, was it something in notions?
We're having a special on assorted buttons and needles.
- Well, it wasn't notions, but I'll take half a dozen packets.
- Fine.
Uh, was it something in yard goods?
- No.
- Thread maybe?
-Mm-mm.
- Mrs. seibert, maybe you came in for a dress pattern.
It's the latest thing.
It, uh, puts milady in style for any social function.
- That's it.
- Oh, good.
- Social function.
John, the most terrible thing's happened to me.
They've elected me president of the civic club.
Now, where is it?
- What, the civic club?
- No! No.
Here it is.
John, will you post this in a conspicuous place?
It's a notice of our Friday meeting in the school auditorium.
- Why, certainly, Hetty.
- I'm sure I'll be a perfectly terrible president.
They only elected me because I have a lot of money.
I'll expect you both at the meeting.
- Oh, why, Hetty, we wouldn't miss it.
- Well, I would, if I weren't president.
- Oh, Mrs. seibert, uh, do you still want these things?
- Oh, yes, thank you.
And will you charge it to my account?
- Yes, I will.
- Now, where was I to go from here?
- Uh, the bank?
The butcher's?
The grocer?
- Never mind. I'll find out when I get there.
Good-bye, John.
Good-bye...
- Lemuel.
- Lemuel.
- Good-bye, Mrs. seibert.
[Bell jingles]
She, uh, is a little forgetful, isn't she?
- About some things, yes.
Put that in a conspicuous spot, will you, Lem?
I'll be in the office.
- Okay.
"Civic club meeting, high school-- come and bring a friend."
9-3-4, please.
I'd like to speak to miss downey, please.
[Line trilling]
- Miss downey speaking.
- Miss downey, this is, uh, Lem siddons.
I'm calling you from across the street.
Hi.
- Mr. siddons, if you're calling in reference to your statement, the bookkeeper--
- no, I'm calling in reference to you.
Uh, can you see this?
- Mr. siddons, I am terribly busy at the moment.
- I-I know you can't read it from there, but, uh, well, it says there's gonna be big doings at the civic club on Friday night and, uh, to come and bring a friend.
- I'm sorry, Mr. siddons. I--
- looks like it's gonna be a pretty exciting night.
Mayor plummer's gonna talk about the sewer problem, uh, look into the future.
- Mr. siddons!
- And there's gonna be a group discussion on our youth today, followed by refreshments.
Do you think maybe you could make it?
- Mr. siddons!
I suppose the antics of our small town amuse you.
- Oh, now,
I was only kidding. I--
- we must seem terribly crude to one who has traveled so widely.
- Anything wrong, miss downey?
- Oh, no.
- Look, miss downey,
I'm crazy about this town.
Mr. Hastings, I was talking to miss downey.
Mr. Hastings!
- Yes, Mr. siddons?
- I was talking to miss downey.
- I'm sorry.
No personal calls during banking hours.
- Now--
- now, if you will permit me, fellow civic clubbers,
I will conclude my very small remarks with a line from that immortal English poet-- a...
A thing of beauty is a joy forever.
[Applause]
- Thank you,
Cora Anderson, for that splendid talk on...
Oh, dear, what was your subject, Cora?
[Laughter]
- The town square.
- Oh, the town square, of course.
Uh, were you for it or against it?
- I wanted to plant peonies.
- Oh, well, bless you, dear.
Go right ahead and do it.
[Laughter]
And now...
And now a word about our youth from the chair.
The chair-- that must be me.
Well, I warned you I'd be a perfectly terrible president.
[Applause]
Well, a word about our youth, especially boys.
Frankly, I think boys are splendid.
Granted, they steal a few apples and play ball in the town square, spill a few garbage pails, and...
Put tin cans on cats, which isn't very nice.
But perhaps the fault lies with us.
Perhaps we could buy them a playing field or something constructive.
Well, I can't think of anything else.
I think Mr. hi plummer, our mayor, should conduct the balance of this meeting.
[Applause]
- Well, there isn't very much to conduct, folks.
I think our boys should be kept off the streets, but how?
I'd like to hear some suggestions.
- Uh, Mr. mayor?
I have a suggestion.
Mr. mayor,
I'm new here in town, so, uh, maybe
I shouldn't even speak up, but, uh, well, it seems to me that the solution to this problem would be to have some sort of organized activity for the boys, like, uh...
Well, like the, uh, boy scouts.
Well, good evening, miss downey,
Mr. Hastings.
- I was going to suggest that very thing.
- Newer.
- Look.
- Well, that idea comes up every year, Lem, but nothing ever seems to come of it.
- Well, then I think you ought make something come of it.
- There's always one trouble.
Nobody ever wants to be scoutmaster.
- You could do that, Ralph.
- No, no,
I'm too busy, vida.
- It wouldn't take very much of your time.
- Absolutely not.
- I thank you for your suggestion, Lem, but I'm afraid that's one job that will go a-begging.
- Well, Mr. mayor, uh...
I might have to take the job myself.
[Crowd gasping positively]
- Are you volunteering?
- I guess I am.
[Applause]
- Come up here, young man.
I want to shake your hand.
- Hup, two, three, four.
Hup, two, three, four.
Hup, two, three, four.
[Applause]
...three, four.
Hup, two, three, four.
Hup, two, three, four.
Hup, two, three, four.
Hup, two, three, four.
Eyes right.
Salute.
Two, three, four.
Hup, two, three, four.
Right, march!
Hup, two-- no, wait, wait, fellas.
Hoodoo!
Where you going?
- But you said to the right.
- Well, you-- you turned left, hoodoo.
[Applause]
Forward march.
Hup, two, three, four.
Hup, two, three, four.
Hup, two, three, four.
Hup, two, three, four.
Hup, two, three, four.
Hup, two, three...
Now right march.
Hup, two, three, four.
- What you trying to do with them poor kids, Lem?
- Just keeping them out of the pool halls, Artie.
Hup, two, three, four.
[Overlapping chatter]
- That a boy.
- Sic 'em, Dutch.
[Dog barking]
[Boys shouting]
- All right, come on, guys, back in line.
[Rock thumps]
- Hey, what's the matter?
Are you wise or something?
- Go ahead, beefy, mobilize him.
- Yeah!
[Boys shouting]
- Beefy!
Never mind the mobilizing.
Get back in line.
Come on.
All of you.
- This is private property, mister.
Stay off.
I'm warning you, mister.
- Look, son--
- [irish accent]
What's going on here, huh?
- Hello, ed.
- I know you, don't I, yeah?
Yeah. You're Lem--
Lem siddons from Artie's place, right?
- That's right.
- Yeah.
Well, what--what seems to be the trouble here?
- Oh, no trouble, ed.
We're, uh, starting a scout troop.
I thought maybe your boy would like to join up.
- Sure, whitey.
You go along with them, huh?
- I don't go picking daisies with a bunch of mama's boys.
- Oh, now, how often have I told you not to--
- that's all right, ed.
Maybe some other time.
All right, fellas, let's get back in line now.
[Boys grumbling]
- Come on.
Come on, all right.
Forward march.
- Whitey?
When will you ever stop being a roughneck, huh?
[Sighs]
- Take a nap, pa.
You'll feel better.
- Yes, I guess I will.
- Look out, look out.
Come on, stop it.
[Bottle shatters]
- "The scoutmaster's job is to train his boys
"to run their own troop.
"The scoutmaster's job is to help boys grow toward responsibility."
- Lem?
- "The scoutmaster leads by example."
- Lem?
- Huh?
[Chuckles] And sometimes he's wise enough to follow.
Come on, hoodoo.
[Whistle blows]
[Boys complaining]
Come on, guys.
Anybody want to go home?
All: No.
- Anybody want to march anymore?
All: No.
- Okay, we'll take a one-minute break.
All: One minute?
[Complaining]
- Now, about this manual
I thought I was reading to you.
In the front part is the, uh, serious stuff, and in the back is the fun and games.
You've got a lot to learn, but believe me, I've got to learn as much as you do.
- We'll help you, Lem.
- Oh, sure. Sure.
- Thanks, hoodoo.
Guys, why don't we try to make this a scout troop the whole town will be proud of, huh?
- Aw, they'll never make it, Lem.
[All arguing]
- Well, we can at least take a stab at it, huh?
Now, when we start off again, why don't we see if we can't sort of shape up, huh?
- What do you mean by shape up?
- Well, when we march, we march in time, move together, you know how they do.
- Oh, yeah.
- I see.
- One thing that'll help maybe, in this book, they suggest that, uh, we get some sort of a marching song.
- Yeah!
A marching song!
- Old MacDonald had a farm.
- Ten little Indians.
- You're in the army now.
- What about
 the dying cowboy?
- Aw, what kind of a marching song is that?
- It's a funeral march.
[All laughing]
- Well, maybe we'll think of something as we go along, huh?
Okay, the minute's up.
On your feet, fellas.
[Boys groaning]
Let's get in line.
Like I said, let's try to shape up.
Okay, get on the packs.
Get in line, fellas.
Snap it up, now.
- Get in line!
- Hoodoo, what are you doing?
- Hey, look out.
- Okay, now, here we go!
Forward march!
Two, three, four.
Hup, two, three, four.
Hup, two, three, four.
All right, guys, lift those feet up.
Come on, lift them up.
Pick them up, put them down.
Pick them up, put them down.
Yeah.
Â¶ Pick them up, put them down Â¶
Â¶ and follow me Â¶ hey, guys, I got a marching song for us.
Â¶ Follow me, boys Â¶
Â¶ follow me Â¶
Â¶ pick them up, put them down Â¶
Â¶ and follow me Â¶
- hey, that's pretty good!
- That's good.
- Sing it, Lem.
- Well, it's something our old outfit used to sing over in France.
We made it up about this sergeant we had, sergeant Riley.
Ha! He was always hollering,
"follow me."
- Well, then sing it, Lem.
- Let's see now.
How'd the verse go?
Â¶ Sergeant Riley said there's a fight to win Â¶
Â¶ follow me, boys Â¶
Â¶ follow me Â¶
Â¶ and it won't be done till we all pitch in Â¶
Â¶ lift your chin with a grin Â¶
Â¶ and follow me Â¶ now the chorus.
All:
Â¶ follow me, boys Â¶
Â¶ follow me Â¶
Â¶ when you think you're really beat Â¶
Â¶ that's the time to lift your feet Â¶
Â¶ and follow me, boys Â¶
Â¶ follow me Â¶
Â¶ pick them up, put them down Â¶
Â¶ and follow me Â¶ pick them up!
Put them down!
Pick them up!
Â¶ It's a long, long climb Â¶
Â¶ but we got the will Â¶
Â¶ follow me, boys Â¶
Â¶ follow me Â¶
Â¶ when we reach the top Â¶
Â¶ then it's all downhill Â¶
Â¶ till you drop, don't stop Â¶
Â¶ and follow me Â¶
Â¶ follow me, boys Â¶
Â¶ follow me Â¶
Â¶ when you think you're really beat Â¶
Â¶ that's the time to lift your feet Â¶
Â¶ and follow me, boys Â¶
- come on, beefy!
All: Â¶ follow me Â¶
Â¶ pick them up, put them down Â¶
[Goat bleats]
Â¶ And fol-low Â¶
Â¶ me Â¶
- hup, two, three, four!
Hup, two, three, four!
Hup, two, three, four!
We're doing pretty good for three weeks, huh, Lem?
- We sure are, hoodoo.
Just about the whole troop can count up to four.
- Sure can.
Hup, two, three, four.
[Car horn honks]
Car's coming, Lem.
Hey, you guys, there's a car coming!
[Horn honking]
[Boys complaining]
- Ralph! That was uncalled for.
- This is a road for motor vehicles, not a marching trail.
- Just because he's the vice President of the bank!
- I'd like to give him a good turn.
- All right, knock it off, fellas.
Knock it off.
Forget it, now, will you?
Now, let's see, uh, according to this gadget, we've hiked about two Miles.
How about the, uh, tracking game now, huh?
All: Yeah!
- I ain't gonna be the raccoon again.
Last time, them guys tried to step on my tail.
- Oh, yeah?
But it's your turn.
- Yeah!
It's your turn!
- Look, I'll be the raccoon this time.
You fellas be the hound dogs, huh?
[All howling]
Wait a minute.
Now, the hound dogs count up to 50 to give the raccoon a start, okay?
- [Quickly]
One, two, three, four--
- now, wait a minute, hoodoo, slow, slow.
One...Two...Three...
I'll see you later, fellas.
- Five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten,
All: 13, 14, 15, 16, 17...
- Hi.
- [Gasps]
Oh, hello.
- Say, you haven't seen my boy scout troop around, have you?
They're supposed to be tracking a raccoon.
I'm the raccoon.
- [Laughs]
- Well, what seems to be the trouble here?
- I don't know.
I guess it's my fault.
I wanted to go on a picnic, and the car doesn't like picnics.
- Oh.
- Mr. Hastings just went to get a tow truck.
- Well, I could try to fix it for you, but, uh,
I'd gum it up.
- Really?
- Yeah, I'm all thumbs.
- I've never met a man who admitted he couldn't fix an automobile.
- Well, that's me.
[Laughs]
Hey, you know, it's kind of a hot day to be a raccoon.
You don't mind if I just stay here and wait for the hounds, do you?
- Oh, no, of course not.
Uh, as a matter of fact--
- miss downey, you, uh, have a little smudge on your nose there.
- Oh.
As a matter of fact,
I wanted to tell you how pleased I was that you mentioned the boy scouts at the civic club meeting.
- Oh!
- I was going to suggest the same thing.
- Were you really?
- Yes.
- Well, isn't that remarkable?
Well, why don't we sit down and discuss it?
Now, uh-- oh, I'm sorry.
Would you care for a drink?
- No, I'm not thirsty.
- Well, now, about the scouts.
The way I look at it--
[Boys howling]
- What does that sound like to you?
- Like a raccoon is about to be treed.
- Yeah.
[All howling]
Okay, okay, okay!
I'm treed! I'm treed!
Okay, guys, you got me!
I'm treed! I'm treed!
[Laughing]
- What do we do now, Lem?
- Oh. Well, uh...
We're going to do what all good scouts do-- lend a helping hand.
Miss downey, would you get in the car, please?
Troop one will show you how scouts do a good turn daily.
Now, you bigger fellas get behind the car, and you other fellas get on each side, okay?
Miss downey, just slide back of the wheel, huh?
[Overlapping chatter]
- Aren't you tired?
- Practically dead.
Got just about enough strength left to ask you to go to the movies with me tonight.
- Oh, I'm sorry, Mr.--
- feel free to call me Lem, huh?
- Mr. siddons--
- I'm named after my Uncle lemuel, who never amounted to anything.
- I'm busy tonight,
Mr. siddons.
- Oh. You know the first thing
I noticed about you, miss downey?
Your eyes--blue eyes.
That means honesty.
- I really am sorry.
- Now, honestly, wouldn't you rather see
Ronald Coleman and Carole lombard in the soul-searching drama of--hey!
Hey, wait!
Look out, guys!
Put on-- put on the brake!
- Oh!
I'm sorry!
The hill was on me before I knew it.
- Oh, that's all right.
I didn't see it, either.
Fellas, pile on, and we'll coast down the hill, huh?
- Aw, neat.
- Miss downey, uh, put on your emergency brake.
Move over and let me drive.
I'll, uh, put it in gear.
Maybe we can start the motor.
Everybody in?
All: Yeah!
- Okay, now, hang on!
[Boys shouting]
[Car backfires]
[Boys shouting]
[Horn honking]
- [Coughing]
Thank you for almost running me down.
- Well, we were just doing our good turn.
We got your motor going.
- All right, out of there, all of you.
This car wasn't built to hold every hoodlum in town.
- Ralph!
- That's all right, miss downey.
All right, you, uh, hoodlums, pile out of there.
We've got a hike to finish.
Come on.
- Aw, we'd rather ride.
- Oh, Mr. Hastings, from now on, I'm the only one who calls them that, right?
Where's the can-- oh, thanks.
All right, now line up by twos.
- Come on.
- Let's go.
- Frankie, you get them started.
- Hup, two, three, four.
All:
Hup, two, three, four.
Hup! Pick them up, put them down.
Pick them up.
Â¶ Follow me, boys Â¶
- that was unnecessarily rude, Ralph.
- Get in the car, vida.
- They were just trying to help with the car.
- Vida, will you please get in the car?
- Â¶ Follow me, boys, follow me Â¶
Â¶ pick them up, put them down Â¶
Â¶ and follow me Â¶
- Mr. siddons!
- Vida!
- Mr. siddons!
- Â¶ follow me, boys Â¶
Mr. siddons!
- Vida, come back here!
- Â¶ When you think you're really beat Â¶
Â¶ that's the time to lift your feet Â¶
Â¶ and follow me, boys Â¶
- vida.
- Â¶ Follow me Â¶
Â¶ pick them up, put them down Â¶
Â¶ and follow me Â¶
[horn honks]
- Lovely movie.
- Yes.
Hello, Mr. Lee.
Yes, I'm glad she finally realized that, uh, money isn't everything.
- Well, when a girl has Ronald Coleman, she doesn't need money.
- [Laughs]
Oh, uh, would you like a soda or a banana split or something?
- I don't think so.
- You sure?
- Sure.
- Well...
[Horn honks]
Tell me.
Was he sore?
- Ronald Coleman?
- No, Mr. Hastings, Ralph.
I mean, because you broke your date with him and went to the movies with me.
- You're a somewhat blunt fellow, aren't you?
- Well, when I want to know something, I ask.
- Well, we like more reserve here in hickory.
- [Chuckles]
Okay, so he got sore.
Vida...
What are you doing tomorrow night?
- Well, Lem, I--
- and Monday night?
- Lem.
- And Tuesday night?
- Oh, Lem.
- And--
[dog barking]
[Whining]
Uh, wait a minute.
[Dog whining]
[Dog barking]
[Whining]
- Beat it, Dutch!
- Are you hurt?
- No, I'm all right.
- Well, then get up on your feet.
- [Groans]
- He is hurt, Lem.
- The ankle, huh?
- It's okay.
- Vida, get me a first-aid kit out of the scout section, will you?
Come over here and sit down, so I can take a look at that ankle.
- I'm all right,
I tell you!
- Come over here and sit down.
- Ooh!
[Dog whines]
- "Over the shoe and tie firmly,
"because once you take the shoe off, you can't get it back on with the swelling."
- Well, that makes sense, huh?
All right, now try to walk on it.
Does that feel better?
- Yeah, it's okay.
That's a pretty good trick.
- Yeah, there are a lot of good tricks in here.
- Aw, I don't go for that scout stuff.
- Well, you better get going.
- Get going?
- Yeah.
And put some cold towels on that ankle when you get home.
- Okay.
Come on, Dutch.
- Uh, why don't we just leave this?
I'll come in early in the morning and clean it up.
- Think you should have done that?
Let him go, I mean.
- I don't know.
- He was stealing, you know?
- Yeah.
You know, I was just like that when I was his age, sore at the world, picking fights, trying to act tough.
But then, uh...
Well, there was this fella, he was a young lawyer, sort of took me under his wing.
I guess he felt sorry for this kid who was trying to lick half of South Chicago and couldn't.
Anyway, he, uh...
He finally straightened me out, got me thinking right.
If it hadn't been for him, I, uh...
I'd have ended up in some kind of serious trouble for sure.
I guess it's about that time
I got the idea
I wanted to be a lawyer someday.
No, I don't think turning whitey in would help anything.
You just got to take a chance.
Well, we'd better go, huh?
- Lem?
- Now, beefy and quong.
- That's for your second-class cooking test?
- Beefy, uh, could you indentify that interesting object?
- Well, it started out as eight biscuits, Lem, but it ended up one.
- Oh.
- Do we pass?
- I, uh, think you better try again, fellas.
Why don't you start out with one?
Maybe it'll end up eight.
[Hammer tapping]
How you coming, Dave?
- Well, not finished yet.
- Carrick bend, huh?
Good.
- When we get finished, can we take her out?
- Of course we can't take her out.
The patch isn't dry.
- What would happen?
- She'd sink.
- That wouldn't help for a canoe merit badge, would it?
- Hoodoo, one thing
I got to give you credit for.
You think quick.
- Yeah, I know.
[Truck rumbling]
- Hey, look who's here.
What do you suppose miss downey's here for?
- Lem.
- Like I said, hoodoo, you think quick.
- Hi.
- I was, uh, invited out here to see scouting in action, remember?
- Well, you can see
Lem in action later.
And you're just in time for the second-class cooking test.
- I thought I might be.
You know, ever since you invited me out here,
I got to thinking about those poor boys out here, eating their own cooking.
I got so emotional,
I went home and fried up six chickens, made four pounds of potato salad.
- Uh, vida?
- I even iced a three-layer chocolate cake.
- Vida, maybe I gave you a bum steer, but the boys are taking tests so that when they get in the woods, they'll be self-reliant.
- Well, they'll be twice as self-reliant on full stomachs.
- [Chuckles] I...
I appreciate your interest in scout stomachs, but, uh,
I think you better take the chicken back to the truck.
- Is that an order?
- No, it's just a suggestion.
- In other words, you forbid me?
- No, I don't forbid you exactly.
- Good.
- Now, wait a minute.
- All right, I, uh...
I forbid you.
- Well, now you sound like Ralph Hastings.
- Oh, now...
- Anyone eat fried chicken?
- Fred chicken? Yeah!
- Vida, what do you think you're doing?
- I'm feeding hungry boys.
- Well, that's exactly what you're not doing.
- Chicken!
- Now, wait a minute, fellas!
Wait a minute!
Wait a minute, now!
Put that chicken back.
I'm sorry, but no chicken.
One of the reasons you're out here is to learn how to cook, and you have to eat what you cooked.
[Boys groan]
- You second-class candidates get back to your fires.
You pup-tent guys get back to your pup tents.
Everybody get back to whatever you're doing.
Now, go on.
Hurry up.
- Oh, man!
[Boys complaining]
- No chicken!
- That was a lovely exhibition.
- Now, vida, listen--
- a 100% domineering,
"I forbid you, let's keep them in their places," male performance.
- Male nothing.
- You're all alike, every last one of you-- puffed up, lords of the universe, egotistical know-it-alls.
And I thought you were different!
- Different?
Vida, all I did was ask you to get rid of the chicken.
- No, you didn't.
You said, "I forbid you."
- Vida, where you going?
Vida, what are you gonna do?
- I'm obeying military orders.
I'm getting rid of the chicken.
- Oh, not in the lake.
Vida--
- typical egotistical male.
- Oh, now, don't do that.
Vida.
- "I forbid you," he says.
Master of the universe.
- No, no, now, not that.
Not in the lake, vida.
No, no, vida, don't do it.
- Are you forbidding me again?
- Well...No, no.
- Good.
- Vida.
Vida, will you listen to me, please?
- Will you kindly get out of my way?
- No, I want to talk to you.
[Pots clatter]
- Oh!
Vida, wait.
Where are you going?
- Anywhere where you're not!
- Uh, fellas, get back to your cooking.
Vida, will you cut out this nonsense?
Now where you going?
- I'm trying to avoid you, and this seems to be the only logical way to do it.
- Well, if that's logical,
I'll go with you.
Vida, you've got to listen to me.
I'm sorry you got upset about my not giving the boys the chicken, but--
- I'm not upset.
Who's upset?
- Well, if you'd just said something,
I mean, if you told me you were bringing it, I...
- Leo, do you think the patch is dry yet?
- Will you stop paddling and listen?
- Uh-uh.
- What do we do?
- If you'd only said something.
- Watch, I guess.
- That's the whole idea.
When they get out in the woods, they're supposed to know-- hey!
- [Gasps]
- Hey, we sprung a leak!
- Aah!
- I thought the boys we're gonna patch this!
- Aah!
- Um...
- Aah.
- Uh...
- Aah! Aah!
[Gasps]
[Chuckling]
- [Laughing]
[Laughing]
- Oh! Oh!
Oh! I surrender!
Oh!
[Cheering]
- Hold it!
[Door opens and closes]
- Ah, everything's out of the car.
- [Laughing]
- What's so funny?
- Oh, this silly picture.
- You never looked lovelier.
- Um, Lem?
- Okay, we've got work to do.
Uh, what's next?
- Well, let's get these empty suitcases out of here.
- Where you want them, under the bed?
- No. In the hall closet,
I guess.
- Boy.
Here, let me do that.
- No, it's okay, just set them down.
- Well, I'll find someplace for this stuff of mine in the morning.
- Oh, I've already got a place.
- Oh?
- Right in here.
- I thought that was supposed to be the sewing room.
- Gonna be your study.
I'm gonna fix it up.
You're going to have to build some shelves for all those law books.
- Vi?
- And I think we should splurge and get you a really nice desk.
- Vi, I guess I forgot to tell you.
They're, uh, having the bar exams next week.
- Really?
- Yeah, but I'm, uh...
I'm not going to take it.
- Oh.
- It's just that
I'm not ready for it.
I haven't looked at one of these books in months.
I've been so busy with the scouts and the store and, uh, other things.
- Meaning me.
- Yeah.
Meaning you.
Next year the troop will be organized, and they can get somebody else to take over.
Next year, I promise,
I'll...
I'll really settle down to business.
- Scout's honor?
- Scout's honor.
[Cornet haltingly playing
 let me call you sweetheart]
What is that? boys: Â¶ let me call you sweetheart Â¶
Â¶ I'm in love with you Â¶
Â¶ let me hear you whisper Â¶
- Lem, a serenade-- what a charming thing to do.
- Â¶ That you love me Â¶
- pretty awful, isn't it?
- Â¶ Too Â¶
Â¶ keep the love light glowing Â¶
Â¶ in your eyes so true Â¶
Â¶ let me call you sweetheart Â¶
Â¶ I'm in love Â¶
Â¶ with Â¶
Â¶ you Â¶
[sustaining long off-key note]
- Welcome home!
- Welcome home,
Mr. and Mrs. siddons!
- Congratulations.
- Thanks, guys.
That was very nice.
- Hey, Lem, can you come out to seibert lake Saturday?
We got a surprise for you.
- A surprise, huh?
Okay, Leo,
I'll see you then.
All:
Good night!
- Congratulations!
- Congratulations, Mrs. siddons.
- Oh, Lem, let's have a dozen kids, all boys.
- [Chuckles]
How about 11 boys and one girl just like you?
- Hey. Hey, Frankie?
- Yeah?
- Follow me, boys.
- No, we made too much noise already.
- Oh, come on, Frankie!
- Well, okay.
But...Quiet.
All:
Â¶ though the journey's end Â¶
Â¶ is beyond our sight Â¶
Â¶ follow me, boys Â¶
Â¶ follow me Â¶
Â¶ if we do our best Â¶
Â¶ then we've done all right Â¶
Â¶ pack your load, hit the road Â¶
Â¶ and follow me Â¶
Â¶ follow me, boys Â¶
Â¶ follow me Â¶
Â¶ when you think you're really beat Â¶
Â¶ that's the time to lift your feet Â¶
Â¶ and follow me, boys Â¶
Â¶ follow me Â¶
Â¶ pick them up, put them down Â¶
Â¶ and follow me Â¶ pick them up, put them down.
Pick them up, put them down.
Pick them up, put them down.
[Hammers pounding]
- Here he comes!
Hey, here comes Lem!
- So soon?
But we're not finished yet!
- I told you!
I told you!
[Boys shouting]
- Hi, Lem!
- Hi, Lem!
- Well, now, what's the surprise?
- How about that, huh, Lem?
Surprised?
- You guys don't mean to tell me you built this all by yourselves?
All: Yeah!
- Including scrounging the lumber.
- We didn't even use nails in some places.
We tied knots.
- Well, fellas,
I don't know what to say, except that, uh, well, it's just absolutely amazing.
- That's just what Mrs. seibert said when she saw it.
- Oh, Mrs. seibert saw it, huh?
- Yeah, she gave us permission to build on the old foundation.
- Lem, the guys want you to be the first one through the front door.
- Oh.
- Yeah, only the front-door committee goofed, and there ain't one up yet.
- Just five minutes.
All me and quong's got to do is nail up a couple more 2x4s.
- That's what you said all week.
- Look, why don't a couple of us guys give you and quong a hand just to make sure?
What size 2x4s you need?
[Overlapping chatter]
- Hey, Lem, you know anything about a water pump?
- Like what, beefy?
- Well, like how to make it pump water.
- Oh.
- This one's kind of beat up, but we got it for free, so we didn't ask any questions.
- Let's take a look at it.
- Hey, let's look in the junk pile, see what we got.
- Valve's a little dried out, isn't it?
[Overlapping chatter]
[Wood clattering]
- Look!
For the top of the cabin.
- Hey, yeah.
That's pretty good.
[Weather vane clangs]
- Pretty good shot.
- It was okay.
- What are you doing out this way?
- Just horsing around.
- How's this one, hoodoo?
- Hey, Frankie, maybe we could use this.
- Isn't this big enough?
- Hey, can I use it on top of the cabin?
- Yeah, put it someplace where you won't lose it.
- What you guys doing, building a cabin?
- Yeah, for our troop.
- Some cabin.
- Yeah, it's okay.
- Well, I'll see you guys.
Come on, Dutch.
- Hey, whitey.
- Yeah?
- You want to help out?
We could use someone who knows about plumbing.
- Well...
I ought to be back in town now.
My old man might need me on a job.
- No, he won't, not right away.
I saw his truck parked over by Artie's pool parlor.
- What was that crack?
- It wasn't any crack.
- Well, if you can't give us a hand, you can't.
Come on, you guys.
Get on these 2x4s.
- What do you care where my old man's truck is parked?
- I don't!
- Take it easy, whitey.
Leo didn't mean anything.
- That's right.
He didn't mean anything.
- You stay out of this, four-eyes!
This isn't your business.
- Hey, no one's called four-eyes around here.
- Yeah, well, you just get your hands off.
- Look, if you can't act decent, then beat it.
- I said get your hands off!
[Dog barking]
- Come on! Get him!
[Boys shouting]
- Hey, watch out for the board!
- Don't let that dog get you!
Get that dog away!
- Go on! Get!
[Boys shouting, dog barking]
- Pull him over!
Pull him over!
- Come on!
- Twist his arm!
Twist his arm!
- All right, that's enough!
Cut it out now!
You, uh, fellas getting a little exercise?
- Yeah, Lem.
That's all.
- Okay.
Well, if you want me to be the first one through that front door, you better get it up, huh?
- Yeah, okay.
Come on, guys.
- Whitey.
This yours too?
- You keep it.
I swiped it off you anyways.
I never hardly read it.
- You didn't, huh?
- It's just full of junk.
- Okay, I'll keep it.
- Come on, Dutch.
- Whitey.
What's the scout law?
- A scout is trustworthy, loyal, helpful, fr-- aw, forget it.
- Whitey, why don't you knock off this tough-guy act?
The boys all want you.
All you have to do is come halfway.
- Yeah, I'll bet.
- You got guts enough to find out?
- Hey, Lem!
We're ready!
- Atten-tion!
One-gun salute!
Fire!
[Bang]
- Now, Lem, you're gonna be the first one through the front door.
- Yeah, come on.
- Look what's inside, man.
- All you have to do is give the secret knock, like this.
- Okay.
[Boards crashing]
Look out, fellas!
Get back!
- The whole thing's coming down!
[Creaking]
[Sign squeaking]
- [Chuckles]
[Laughing]
[All laughing hysterically]
I guess one of your knots must have slipped, huh?
- Yeah.
- Well, guys, that was a pretty good practice cabin.
Now what do you say we build a real one, huh?
All: Yeah!
- All right, let's clear all that junk out of there.
Beefy, you take charge of the clean-up squad.
Mickey, go over to the truck and get my tools out, will you?
Whitey, uh, why don't you start working on that pump?
Get everything out of there and take it over to the junk pile, huh?
Well, I guess, uh, everything's gonna work out all right, Frankie.
[Laughter and shouting]
- Hey, whitey, how long you gonna be?
- I'll be right out.
She's sewing my first-class badge on.
- In the meantime,
I don't have a horse for horse and rider.
- Just a couple of minutes.
I sure do appreciate this,
Mrs. siddons.
You know, next year,
I'm going for my merit badges.
First aid, that's going on top.
Thanks.
My Uncle sid was a vet, but I'm figuring to be a regular doctor of medicine.
- [Choked up] I'm sure you'll be a good one, whitey.
- You feeling okay,
Mrs. siddons?
- Yes, I'm fine.
- How's it look?
- Looks just grand.
- And after first-aid merit badge, then I'm going to carpentry.
- See you later, fellas.
- Hey, Lem!
Look!
- That's fine, whitey.
Hi, honey.
- Well, I...Guess the guys are waiting for me.
- Oh, whitey?
- Yes, sir?
- Your dad came into the store today.
I told him I was sorry that he, uh, couldn't come to father's night out at the cabin.
Whitey?
- Yes, sir?
- You didn't ask him to come, did you?
You told me you did and that he couldn't make it, right?
Whitey?
- Yes, sir.
- Okay.
Run along, whitey.
Oh, whitey?
I invited your dad myself.
He said he'd be there.
- Well...
- Lem, you shouldn't have done that.
He doesn't want his father at that meeting.
- Well, he could have come and told me, couldn't he?
- No, he couldn't.
He's crazy about his father, and he's ashamed of him at the same time.
Everyone knows ed is a drunk.
[Crying]
- Vi...
Vi, what's wrong?
- Well, you just can't expect a little boy to make a laughingstock out of someone he loves.
- Honey, I'm not talking about whitey.
It's you.
You've been taking things so hard these last few weeks.
I guess that medicine
Dr. Ferris gave you for your nerves isn't helping much, huh?
Did you see him today?
- Yes.
- Well, what did he say?
- It isn't my nerves.
Never was.
I just told you that.
I lied too.
- Oh?
- He's been giving me a series of tests.
I can't have any children...
Now or ever.
- Is he, uh...
Is he sure?
- The tests were very thorough.
- Did he, uh, just tell you today?
- An hour ago.
[Crying]
I'm so terribly sorry, Lem.
I'm so sorry.
If I'd known before we were...
- Honey, you, uh...
You can just tell
Dr. Ferris that he's wrong.
- Oh, no, Lem, he isn't.
- Yeah, he's dead wrong.
[Boys shouting outside]
- Vida, we can have kids.
Come here.
We've already got 15 boys.
That's a pretty good start when you come to think of it.
[Shouting]
[Applause and cheering]
- Dead heat-- two minutes on the nose.
That's good, guys.
Now, uh, the knot-tying.
I, uh, guess a lot of people have the idea that about the only thing scouts do is, uh, tie knots.
Uh, Leo, uh...
- Come on, Leo!
[Boys kidding Leo]
- I'll, uh--I'll kind of start things off here by tying a sheepshank.
Now, a sheepshank is used if you want to shorten a piece of rope.
Now, let's see here, uh...
No, no.
[Laughter]
Uh, well, so much for the sheepshank.
[Laughter]
You know, I never could tie one of these things to save my neck.
We'll just let Leo demonstrate the knots, I guess.
Go ahead, Leo.
- Slipknot.
- Hello, Lem.
- Ed.
- It's all right.
G-go right ahead.
I-I, uh...
Just brought the boys a little ice cream.
Nothing that kids like better than a little ice cream.
Oh! Oh!
Right, Mr. Lee?
Uh...Uh...
Don't let me interrupt, Lem.
Go--go right ahead.
Right good old scoutmaster, lemmy boy, right?
- Uh, Leo, you were going to tie a slipknot.
- Slipknot.
- Uh...Uh, hold it.
Hold it a second.
I-I-I think we sprung a little leak here.
Yeah. Don't-- don't you worry, fellas.
Don't you worry.
We got a reliable plumber here.
Hey, that's--that's kind of joke, isn't it?
Call for a plumber.
We've sprung and ice cream leak, huh?
Right, huh?
Ha ha!
Oh!
[Loud thud]
- Get your hands off him!
Let him be!
- I just brought the boys a little ice cream. I...
- I know, pa.
Come on.
- Well, where are we going, whitey?
Uh, meeting is just starting, ain't it?
Huh?
- I know, pa.
I know.
- Frankie, take over, will you?
Uh, keep things going?
- Sure.
- Ah, whitey, whitey.
Your father's a...
Your father's a bum.
Real, no-good bum.
Right?
Right.
- Forget it, pa.
- Whitey.
I'll drive you home.
- You leave us alone.
It was your idea, bringing him out to the meeting.
- I know, whitey.
I'm sorry.
I was wrong.
- All right, all right, you were wrong!
I'm wrong! He's wrong!
Everybody's wrong!
- Easy, whitey.
Easy.
Respect your elders, remember?
He's just a little upset.
- Come on, pa.
Let's go home.
- Good night, Lem.
- Good night, ed.
I can walk, whitey.
I can walk real fine.
- I really messed the whole thing up good, didn't I?
And I thought
I knew so much.
- Come to bed, Lem.
- Well, I'm gonna call the troop committee.
They can get somebody else.
Somebody who'll do a better job than I've done.
- Oh, now, that's nonsense, Lem.
Every boy in that troop thinks the sun rises with you, including whitey.
- Yeah, well, I'm gonna give the whole thing up, get back to my law books.
- Mrs. siddons!
Mrs. siddons!
Mrs. siddons, there's something the matter with pa!
He fell on the floor, and he can't get up!
Please, Mrs. siddons,
I got to use your phone for the doctor!
- I'll come right down and open the door.
- We'll wait for the ambulance, but I don't think it's gonna do any good.
All that booze--
I warned him a year ago about his heart.
- What about the boy?
- Now, that's gonna be a problem.
- We'll take him in with us tonight.
- Nobody's taking me anyplace!
Pa's gonna be all right!
- [Strained]
Whitey.
[Siren wailing]
- [Crying]
[Siren slows and stops]
- Vi?
Why don't we decide right now?
After all, we've got
16 kids already.
The only difference is this one would sleep in.
- Are you sure you really want him, Lem?
- I'm sure.
How about you?
- I'm sure.
- Okay, then it's all settled.
- Will you tell him?
- Yeah, I'll tell him.
Hey, uh, coffee for a kid his age?
- Just for tonight.
Come have a bite to eat.
- I'm not hungry.
- Whitey...
There's something we'd like to talk to you about.
How would you like to live here with us?
- I don't want to be any charity case!
- Whitey.
- I ain't gonna live here, and you can't make me!
- Whitey, sit down, hmm?
- You're just doing your boy scout duty.
Well, I don't need that kind of stuff.
I can earn my own living.
I don't need you!
I don't need anybody!
- Whitey, now, you sit down, or I'm gonna have to clout you one.
- Oh, Lem, don't talk to him like that.
- Vi, I'll handle it.
- Come on, Dutch!
- Whitey, now, you listen to me.
We want you to live here with us.
No duty, no boy scout stuff.
We don't have a kid of our own, and we want one.
Sometimes you're no great shakes, but we both love you, whitey, and we need you, and you need us.
Can you get that through that thick head of yours?
- We have a room for you, whitey.
Won't you come look at it?
- We'll, uh, clear all my stuff out of here over the weekend.
Uh, I'll leave my old saxophone here just in case you might want to blow it sometime.
We'll make that part of the deal, huh?
You'll have to sleep on the couch a night or two until we get a bed in here.
It'll be your room, whitey.
If you want to be alone, you just shut the door, and nobody'll bother you.
Um...
I'll go get a pillow and some blankets.
- Won't you give us a chance, whitey?
- I wouldn't knock on it too hard.
The whole thing's liable to come down on you.
- Does aunt Hetty know about all of this?
- Oh, yeah, she knows.
She was out here Sunday.
As a matter of fact, she, uh, wanted to know if it'd be all right if she just sat here on the steps and looked out at the lake for a while.
- Sometimes I worry about aunt Hetty.
She has some very peculiar notions about this place.
Lem, do you know how much this lake property is worth?
- Well, I guess I never, uh, thought of it in terms of money.
- Properly developed, at least half a million.
- Half a million, huh?
- At least.
Yes, a valuable piece of property, Lem.
- We'll try to take good care of it for you, Ralph.
- For me?
- I imagine it will be yours someday, won't it?
- Oh, I imagine it will...
Someday.
Well, I'd better be getting back.
By the way, Lem,
I, uh...
I thought you'd be off hiking this morning.
- I thought I'd leave the hiking to the boys today.
Whitey and a couple of the fellas are taking the tenderfoot patrol up the Mountain.
- Whitey?
- Yeah.
He just made patrol leader.
- With his background,
I'd hardly have thought he was the caliber to--
- Ralph, whitey is loaded with caliber.
- Well, I just hope he never disappoints you, Lem.
- Easy.
Easy, now.
[Grunts]
- Hurry up, whitey!
I'm scared!
- Hold it there!
- Hold it!
- What are you doing?
- I just kicked some dirt loose.
Now, you're gonna be all right.
I'm coming after you.
Just don't panic.
- Hurry up, whitey.
- I'm coming, Ronnie!
I'm coming!
Let it out easy!
- Let it out easy, hoodoo!
Nice and easy.
- Yeah, come on, you guys.
Let it out easy.
- [Whines]
- Is whitey all right?
- Yeah.
Boy, if we get that goof-off
Ronnie out of there,
I'm gonna break his neck.
- Big show-off.
Had to go waltzing on the edge.
Whitey told him a dozen times.
- Easy, hoodoo!
Let it out easy.
You okay, whitey?
- Yeah! Just a couple of feet more!
- Just a couple more feet.
- Okay! Hold it there!
- Hold it!
- Get back!
I'm gonna try to swing over!
- Closer!
- Get back, ya dope!
Give me room!
Give me room!
- No! No!
- No, Ronnie, let go!
Let go!
[Dog barking]
[Whitey straining]
- Come on, whitey.
[Dog barking]
Slack off!
Slack off!
- Give him slack, quick!
He made it!
- [Panting]
Okay.
Everything's okay, Ronnie.
Just let me tie this around your waist.
- No!
- Ronnie, get up.
- I can't!
I'm scared!
- Come on, Ronnie!
Now stand up!
You're gonna be all right, Ronnie.
You're safe now.
The guys'll have you up on top in no time, honest.
[Dog whines]
- Okay, guys, get ready to pull him up!
- Okay, get ready to pull him up.
- Now just hold on tight, don't look down.
Don't look down!
Okay.
Pull him up.
- Pull, guys!
Pull!
Pull, hoodoo!
Pull.
Pull!
- Come on, you guys!
Pull hard! Pull!
- Pull, guys!
Pull!
- You're gonna be all right, Ronnie!
Don't look down!
- As soon as we get him up here, whitey, we'll drop the rope for you!
- Yeah.
You do that.
- You're quite right,
Mrs. Larsen.
In my opin-- exactly, Mrs. Larsen.
I quite agree with you.
We certainly will,
Mrs. Larsen.
We'll get to the bottom of it, and, uh...
I hope that Ronnie feels better today.
Good-bye.
Good morning, aunt Hetty.
That was Mrs. Larsen.
I suppose you've heard about Ronnie.
- Of course I've heard.
The whole thing's a disgrace.
The boy wasn't hurt.
He was just frightened.
- Aunt Hetty, everyone can hear you.
- Well, let them.
It's outrageous the way this town is gossiping.
I don't want to sit down.
Aren't you taking me to lunch?
- Yes, of course, aunt Hetty.
But I would hardly call it gossip.
Lem did give the patrol to a boy whose record as a delinquent--
- well, if it hadn't been for that delinquent keeping his head in an emergency and risking his own life, there might have been real trouble.
- Yes, aunt Hetty.
Where would you like to have lunch?
- I've decided to eat alone.
- Aunt Hetty!
- Gossip, that's all anyone ever does-- gossip.
- Here, you better take this.
- It's your new compass.
You crazy?
- Well, suppose you're somewhere, you want to know where it is.
You'll need it.
- Leo.
- Don't be a dolt.
Take it.
- Okay.
Thanks, Leo.
- You'll need a pup tent.
- Pick mine up out at the cabin.
- Well, what about money?
- I'll get a job, plumber's helper or something.
I used to work with pa.
- Whitey.
- Yeah?
- I'd go with you, only I got an appointment with the eye doctor Monday.
- That's okay.
Thanks anyway.
- I'll go with you, whitey.
I got no appointments.
- Take over the patrol, Leo.
See these guys shape up, you hear?
Well, Leo, see you.
- See you.
- Hoodoo.
- Yeah.
- Now don't you go bawling.
- Bawling?
Why would I go bawling?
I'm 13 years old.
- Yeah.
- You on the roof okay, whitey?
- Yeah.
Here, Dutch.
- That you, Lem?
- Yeah, it's me.
Oh, hi, fellas.
Were you up with whitey?
- Uh...
- Yeah, Lem.
We were up there with him.
Come on, hoodoo.
- Hi.
- Hello.
- We're having cold supper.
Be in ten minutes.
- Fine.
- The whole town still talking?
- No, they've stopped talking.
Now they're acting.
Two ladies came in the store today and decided that Mr. Hughes could wait on them a lot better than I could.
- Well, this is a small town, Lem.
These gossip storms pass.
- But what right have they got to stand in corners and whisper about that boy?
Well, I've had enough.
So his old man was a drunk.
What's that got to--
378, please.
- This will all blow over, believe me.
- Vida, I'm not waiting for it to blow over.
I'm calling hi plummer, and I'm going-- hello, hi.
This is Lem siddons.
I'm calling to tell you there won't be a scout meeting tonight.
I'm resigning.
- Lem, you can't do that.
- That's what my wife just said, hi.
But you're both wrong.
I can, and I do.
And you'll have it in writing first thing in the morning.
- Lem, please don't.
- I'm sorry, hi.
There's nothing to talk over.
I'll see you tomorrow.
The boy isn't going to take a beating from brainless gossip if I can help it.
I'll be upstairs with whitey.
[Door opens]
Where do you think you're going?
- How'd you know
I was here?
- Well, it wasn't hard.
I figured if you were taking off, you might want some of your camping stuff.
You were just going to leave without a word to vida and me?
Oh, whitey.
You want to know something?
This is just the same kind of bullheaded stunt
I used to pull when I was a kid-- take off, run away.
Thought that would solve everything.
I can tell you it never does, whitey.
You've got responsibilities.
You've got a couple of people who need you very much.
This whole thing will blow over.
I gave them my resignation.
That's all the town wants, really.
- You can't quit, Lem.
- Why not?
- Well, because like you said, it wouldn't solve anything.
- Well, now just a second.
It's different with me.
- How?
- Well, it's just different, that's all.
- Lem, if I got responsibilities, believe me, you got worse.
All the guys depend on you.
- Look, who's lecturing who around here?
- Lem, you can't quit!
There wouldn't even be a scout troop without you.
- Whitey.
- You just can't quit, that's all.
- Now, just take it easy, huh?
- Please, Lem.
Please.
[Car horns honking]
- Hello, Lem.
- Hello.
Who's that?
- Hi plummer.
All right, park anywhere you can, folks.
[Overlapping talking]
All right, gather round, everybody.
Gather round.
- Hi, what is all this?
- Well, sir, I called in some reinforcements to get you to change your mind.
Boys: Yeah!
- Well, that's very nice of all of you, but, well, I'm afraid you're a little late, hi.
- Oh, come on, now, Lem.
Don't say that.
- Well, you see, whitey and I decided just a couple of minutes ago that I'd withdraw my resignation.
[Cheering]
- Told you it was dopey to run away.
- Yeah.
- Well, folks, it looks like we came all the way out here for nothing.
- Why, we can't have that.
I'll tell you, as long as you're all out here, why don't we make this parents' night?
- Good idea!
- Frankie, you take everybody inside, and we'll start the meeting.
- Okay, fall in, everybody, and follow me.
[Excited chatter]
[Upbeat marching music]
- hi, Lem.
Time for reveille?
- Shh.
 Reveille, tiger?
They only saw the taps about ten minutes ago.
- Well, I got to be ready for reveille so I can fire the Cannon when they raise the flag.
That's my job, 6:00.
- I know, tiger.
Right now your job is to get some sleep.
You got to be tired.
After all, you guys hiked all the way from seibert lake over into Clark county.
That's almost 12 Miles.
- And you didn't have to carry me once.
- No, not once, tiger.
- Boy, I'll bet
I'll be a good soldier, won't I, Lem?
Just like your son whitey, the one that's in the medical corps.
- Sure you will, tiger.
- When I'm old enough to enlist...
- Well, you're never going to be old enough if you don't get some sleep.
Now, come on, lie down there.
Good night.
- Night, Lem.
- Now close your eyes, huh?
- They're closed.
- Well, then go to sleep.
- I'm asleep!
I'm asleep!
- Okay, tiger.
Good night.
See you in the morning.
- Ah! Oh!
- Hey, sarge, call the medic!
I'm hit!
- Merv, get off me.
You're sitting on my hand grenades.
- Some transportation.
Wait till my draft board hears about this.
- Shut up, the lot of you.
We're in the blue zone.
- Hey, sergeant, if we're in the blue zone, that means the games have started already, huh?
- Games! Oh, goody, we're gonna play games.
- This ain't no game, soldier.
This here's a tactical exercise to teach dumb squirts like you how to act when they meet the enemy.
We're gonna simulate war.
- What's simulate?
- Sort of making out, like with play-acting.
We make out like we're shooting the enemy and getting our heads blown off.
- With real live ammo?
- Nah, just blank cartridges and smoke bombs like that.
Everything's fake.
That right, sarge?
- Like I said, we call it simulating.
All: Oh!
- Hey, sarge, I think we just hit a simulated rock.
- [Whistling]
[Leaves rustling]
Hi.
- Hands behind your neck.
- What?
- Do like he says.
You're captured.
- Captured?
- Both hands behind your neck.
- Oh, now, wait--
- fast!
- Keep them there.
- Look, if you fellas are at your war games or something, you've got the wrong guy.
I'm not the army.
I'm a scoutmaster.
My troop's right over there.
- Behind your neck.
- So you're a scoutmaster, huh?
- That's right.
If you don't believe me, just look over in that hollow over there.
We've got a scout camp right over there.
- Don't worry about that, pal.
The artillery will take care of them.
- Boy scouts.
- Oh, boy scouts.
Now that is a real Lulu.
- I don't know who you fellas think I am.
- We don't think.
That's for officers.
- Well, I'll tell you anyway.
My name is Lem siddons and--
- all you have to say is your name, rank, and serial number.
- I told you my name.
- Corporal, you want me to knock him in the head?
- No. All spies go to interrogation.
- Oh, I'm no spy.
- Hey, what about your field glasses?
- We just use those for-- for bird-watching.
- Ha! Bird-watching.
- Yes.
- Wait till interrogation gets ahold of this one.
All right, move out.
- Move out where?
- Move!
- Come on!
- Ten-hut!
- Good morning, lieutenant.
- Oh, lieutenant, am I glad to see you, sir.
- Speak when you're spoken to, prisoner.
All right, speak.
- Lieutenant, my name is Lem siddons.
I'm a civilian, and this whole thing is one big cockeyed mistake.
- Where was he taken?
- Behind our lines, sir.
- Lieutenant, I can explain this whole thing very simply.
I was down at the creek, and I was starting to shave--
- we removed these from the prisoner when we searched him, sir-- compass, signaling device.
- Signal-- that's my shaving mirror.
- Tactical map.
- That's a topographical map.
My scouts haven't been in this area before, and that is an official boy scout compass.
And those binoculars, believe it or not, are for watching birds.
- For watching birds?
- That's right.
- Very clever.
And you're a scoutmaster?
- That's right!
- Tie a sheepshank.
- A sheepshank.
- Sheepshank.
- Lieutenant,
I'll level with you.
The sheepshank is one knot
I've never been able to tie very well.
Would you settle for a square knot or maybe a bowline?
- Prepare this prisoner for tactical interrogation.
- Tactical interrogation?
Lieutenant, this may be some kind of war game with you fellas, but I've got a scout troop out there.
- Process this man and transfer him to command along with the other prisoners.
- We haven't taken any other prisoners, sir.
- That's an order, sergeant.
- Yes, sir.
- Uh...
- Carry on, men.
- Shouldn't we wait for Lem?
- Has anybody seen him?
- He's probably down by the creek washing up, but he'd want us to go ahead right on time.
- So raise the flag.
I'm hungry.
- Not until 6:00.
- Very technical.
- Okay, it's 6:00.
Attention.
Ready, tiger?
One...
Two...
Fire.
[Cannon fires]
- What was that?
- Fire.
[Cannon fire echoing]
- All I did was pull a cord and look what happened.
- Hey, what are you guys doing up there?
- What are you doing down there?
- I've been looking for Lem.
He's not down at the creek.
He's not anywhere.
[Projectile whistles]
[Explosion]
- Never mind Lem!
We got to get out of here!
We're being invaded.
- They must have come up from Mexico.
- Or down from Canada.
- Follow me!
- Hey, where you going?
- Don't ask questions!
Follow him!
- Hey, you guys, come back here.
It's only war games.
- Wait!
Go back!
Go back!
- Aah!
Aah!
[Explosions]
- Look out!
Let's get out of here!
- Yeah.
- Wait for me.
- Hey, you guys, will you please listen?
Hey, how can you listen when you're running?
[Gunfire, explosions]
- Flour, nothing but flour.
- Doesn't taste like flour to me.
Tastes like something poisonous.
- Cyanide.
- Here he comes again.
- Hey, come on, you dope!
[Scouts shouting]
[Overlapping shouting]
[Coughing]
- Whatever it is.
- What kind of place is this anyway?
- An enemy fort.
- You think?
- Yeah, and maybe they're coming back.
All:
Coming back?
- We got to get out of here.
- Shut up, you guys. There's a message coming through.
All:
A message?
- What's it say, Harry?
- I don't know.
Ollie, you know morse code.
What's it saying?
[Telegraph clicking]
- It's saying,
"post four answer."
- Well, go ahead, answer.
- Well, what do I say?
- Just say-- just say hello.
- [Clicking]
- They said what?
- "Hello, hello, hello."
- Hello, hello what?
- Just hello.
- Tell them to identify.
- [Clicking]
- "Identify."
- Well, go ahead, identify.
- Yeah, tell them who we are.
- [Clicking]
- Hawk...
Patrol...
B.S.A...
Hickory?
- Boy, have they got a code.
That bunker's been captured.
Contact tank command to blue fox and tell them to counterattack immediately.
- [Clicking]
- [Clicking]
- Come on, Ollie.
It's our last chance.
- They just won't answer anymore.
- Keep trying.
- Maybe they use a different code on account of Samuel morse was an American.
- Hey, shut up, tiger.
Keep trying.
Send s.O.S. Or something.
- Holy jumping blue-eyed cow.
- What is it, Jimmy?
- It's a tank with a Cannon on the front of it.
All: A tank?
- With a Cannon on the front of it?
- It's a tank, all right.
- Is that a real Cannon?
It's a real Cannon, all right.
- We're under attack.
[All shouting]
- Let me think!
This can't be for real.
- What are these things?
- Maybe it is.
- Who did that?
- I did it.
- Hit another one, Ollie.
- I did it again!
- We're counterattacking.
Fire number three.
[Explosion]
- And number four!
Hit it, Ollie!
Yeah!
[Overlapping chatter]
[Cheering]
- Our tank is falling back, sir.
They're under heavy attack.
- Tell them they can't retreat.
This is fighting.
- [Clicking]
[Excited chatter]
- Look.
- It's coming back.
- Blow it up again, Ollie.
- I pushed all the buttons.
- Push them again.
[Overlapping chatter]
- Hey, look.
Maybe this'll work.
- Let me see, Duke.
[Gunfire]
Did I stop them?
- No, they're still coming!
- What do we do now, Harry?
- I don't know.
How should I know?
- What does this mean, Ollie?
- How should I know?
You ask me, I think we should surrender.
- It's got to be something.
- Did I do that?
- Hey! What's the matter with you guys in there, huh?
What are you, crazy?
- Okay, tag them all prisoners.
Tactically captured by counterattack in this bunker here.
- Captured?
Hey, we knocked out this position an hour ago.
- Are you arguing with the decision of an umpire, sir?
- I'm not arguing!
I'm telling!
This bunker's been neutralized.
You're gonna have to change your decision.
- I don't change nothing, sir.
- You giving me lip, sergeant?
- Knock if off, sir, or I'll throw you out of the game.
- Throw me out?
- Yeah!
- Kill the umpire.
- Who said that?
I'll throw out the whole bunch of you.
- Atta boy, sarge.
- Who's gonna throw who out?
- You shut up.
You're dead.
The decision of the umpire stands.
- Oh, come on, now!
- It stands.
Okay, all personnel in the bunker, come on out.
You've captured this tank here.
- Boy scouts?
- Did he say we captured that tank?
- That's what he said.
[All cheering]
- Hey, mister, do we get to keep the tank or do we have to give it back after the war?
- All right, what's your decision now, ump?
- Boy scouts, girl scouts, my decision still stands.
You're captured.
That's it.
Boys: Â¶ follow me, boys, follow me Â¶
Â¶ when you think you're really beat Â¶
Â¶ that's the time to lift your feet Â¶
Â¶ and follow me, boys Â¶
Â¶ follow me Â¶
- hey, sergeant, come out here and take a look.
- What?
Where do you think you're going?
[Singing continues]
- What's that?
Boys:
Â¶ follow me, boys Â¶
- my boy scouts.
- What's that?
- That's his boy scouts.
- Boy scouts?
Boys:
Â¶ and follow me Â¶
Â¶ follow me, boys, follow me Â¶
- boy scouts.
- That's what I've been trying to tell you.
- What do we do with him now, lieutenant?
- Show him how to tie a sheepshank and let him go.
- Let me out of here, sergeant.
Boys: Â¶ put them down and follow me Â¶
- hi, Lem!
- Hi, guys!
Boy, am I glad to see you.
What are you doing up there?
- And I did it, Lem.
I started the whole war.
I pulled the string.
[Overlapping chatter]
- What is it, Lem?
What happened?
- Oh, what--
- I don't know, guys.
- Well, what about all our stuff in the cabin?
[Overlapping talking]
- Don't worry about it.
It will be all right.
- You think this could be on the count of us capturing that tank, Lem?
- Don't be a dork.
Somebody legal wants us out of here.
Isn't that right, Lem?
- That's the way it looks,
Harry, yeah.
- Yeah, but why, Lem?
- I just don't know, Duke.
[All chattering]
[Car horn honks]
Mrs. seibert.
- Lemuel.
Boys.
Boys:
Hello, Mrs. seibert.
- I couldn't believe it.
Ralph said he was going to do it, but I just didn't believe him.
You're Charlie Davis' boy.
Oliver, isn't it?
- Yes, ma'am.
- And you're Duke.
- Yes, ma'am.
- Jimmy.
- Yes, ma'am.
- And you're--
- Virgil Higgins, ma'am.
But my name is tiger.
- Oh, I wanted it to be a surprise.
- You wanted what to be a surprise, Mrs. seibert?
- I was going to give you this lake.
- Give it to us?
- Lemuel, do you think
I'm mentally unbalanced?
- You?
Why, certainly not.
- Well, my nephew says I am just because I want to give away my own property.
He's asked the court to appoint a guardian to manage my financial affairs.
There's to be a hearing in two weeks on my mental competency.
Now, what would you do if you were me?
- Well, the first thing I'd do is punch him in the nose.
But if I were you,
Mrs. seibert,
I'd fight him legally all the way.
- That's just what
I'm going to do.
Oh, lemuel, will you help me?
- Any way I can.
- Thank you.
Good-bye, lemuel.
- Good-bye, Mrs. seibert.
- Good-bye, boys.
Boys:
Bye, Mrs. seibert.
- Thank you.
- She was gonna give us the whole lake.
Guess that would sound kind of wacky, wouldn't it?
- And it is our further contention, your honor, that the increasing burden of years has visibly affected
Mrs. seibert's judgment and financial responsibility, that the management of her not unsizable fortune has become increasingly clouded with her eccentric decisions...
- What's going on?
- Hasty formulations, and inconsiderate financial commitments.
Now, in support of these contentions, your honor, we have heard witnesses who have observed
Mrs. seibert's behavior over a long period of years.
- Ralph, stop biting your fingernails.
[Laughter]
My sister used to put mustard on his nails when he was little.
- Your honor.
- Mrs. seibert, may we let counsel sum up?
- Oh, of course.
Go right ahead, young man.
- Thank you.
We have heard from Mrs. Collins, who testified that as far back as 1926 she visited the lake and was invited into a nonexistent kitchen.
- He bit me once when he was seven.
[Laughter]
- And Mr. Johnson, who testified that he was hired to remove a tree because it blocked the view from a nonexistent veranda.
Now, your honor, as much as my client regrets it, we must submit that Mrs. seibert suffers from hallucinations, that she is not able to determine financial values as manifested by her capricious decision to give a half-a-million-dollar property to a few dozen boy scouts.
- Hallucinations?
- For her own good, your honor, we ask that a guardian be appointed to manage the affairs of Hetty cutler seibert.
[Crowd murmuring]
- Young man, you are a popinjay.
- Aunt Hetty.
- And you are an employer of popinjays.
[Laughter]
[Gavel bangs]
- Your honor.
- Yes, Mr. siddons?
- Things have been moving along here pretty fast, and nobody has heard
Mrs. seibert in her own defense.
Now, as a prospective trustee of the lake property and an interested party to this action,
I'd like to ask a few questions, if our counsel will permit.
- I have no objections, your honor.
- Well, I have, your honor.
If it please the court, this is highly improper.
- This is not a trial,
Mr. Cooper.
I see no reason why Mr. siddons' questions would topple the pillars of justice.
Mrs. seibert, would you please take the stand and be sworn in?
- Isn't Lem just wonderful?
- He hasn't said anything yet.
- Shh.
- Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you may give in the cause now pending before this court shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?
- Of course I do.
- State your name, please.
- Now, Charlie.
- Just for the record.
- Hetty cutler seibert.
- Thank you.
- All right,
Mr. siddons, proceed.
- Thank you, your honor.
Mrs. seibert, do you know what an hallucination is?
- Anybody knows that.
It's a psychotic condition marked by delusion and loss of contact with reality.
Isn't that correct?
- Oh, yes, yes.
I'd say that was a reasonable description.
Now, Mrs. seibert,
Mrs. Collins and others have testified that you often sat alone out at the lake, usually on the steps of the cottage.
- No one is ever alone who has something good to remember.
- No, of course not.
Now, Mrs. seibert,
I'm going to ask you a blunt question.
Do you believe that a cottage now exists at the lake?
Mrs. seibert?
- Only in my memory, lemuel.
- Mrs. seibert, if a cottage does not now exist at the lake, what happened to it?
- It burned to the ground...
September 26,
Two days...
- Two days after you learned that both your sons had been killed in action in France.
- Yes.
- Your honor, he's leading the witness.
- Quite skillfully too.
Mr. siddons, please do not lead the witness.
- Of course not, your honor.
Now, Mrs. seibert, the cottage was a very special place.
I mean, it meant a great deal to your boys, didn't it?
- Yes.
My boys played there many years.
That's why when you brought the scouts to the lake,
I could see my boys playing again.
Oh, I wanted that more than anything-- a place where boys could play just as my boys did.
- Your honor, I do not think this is relevant.
- Well, then why don't we make it relevant?
Why don't we direct our attention to Mrs. seibert's inability to determine financial values.
Mrs. seibert, you are aware, are you not, of the real reason for this hearing?
- Of course.
Ralph wants to keep the lake in the family and develop it.
- Your honor,
I must protest.
- I suppose you must.
But I wish you wouldn't.
- Now, Mrs. seibert, the development of this property was planned as a benefit to the community, of course?
- Well, more or less as a benefit to Ralph,
I should say-- a tax shelter.
[Crowd murmuring]
- A what?
- A tax shelter.
- Your honor, I cannot see where this line of questioning is taking us.
- Neither do I.
Certainly sounds interesting.
Go ahead.
- Mrs. seibert, could you explain this tax shelter to his honor?
- Of course.
It's simply a question of accelerated depreciation on development housing, assuming a straight-line depreciation rate and subsequent sale at book value, which would create a capital-gains situation, thereby avoiding
75% of normal taxes.
Permitted under section 1201 of the internal revenue code.
- Was that clear, your honor?
- I never heard anything like it.
- Well, I guess those are all the questions
I wanted to ask, your honor.
- Mr. Cooper, you don't have any questions, do you?
- No, your honor.
- Good.
- Mrs. seibert, thank you very much.
You may step down.
- Would it help if I'd quote from section 1201 of the code?
[Applause]
- Lem did it.
He did it.
- That's the prettiest thing I ever saw.
[Gavel bangs]
- Order.
Order, please.
Mr. Hastings, I am going to be charitable and give you permission to withdraw your request for appointment of a guardian for your aunt, Mrs. seibert.
Do you wish to make such a withdrawal?
- Yes, your honor, I do.
- Petition for appointment of a guardian for Mrs. seibert is hereby denied.
Hearing adjourned.
[Applause]
- Way to go, Lem.
You showed them, Lem.
- [Playing saxophone]
- Â¶ Happy Birthday to you Â¶
Â¶ Happy Birthday to you Â¶
Â¶ Happy Birthday, dear John Â¶
Â¶ Happy Birthday to you Â¶
- [continues playing]
[Both chuckle]
- Oh, vida, didn't I tell you last year no more birthdays?
- Mm-hmm, you tell me that every year.
Happy Birthday, dear.
- Thank you.
- Happy Birthday, John.
- All right, Lem.
- Now, make a wish and blow out the candle.
- Make a wish.
Well...
[Inhales deeply]
Say, how old am I?
Darned if I remember.
- And I refuse to tell you.
- You're the same age you were that morning you hired me and not a day older.
- Oh, good lord, do you remember that morning?
- Aren't you going to make a wish?
- You know, I figured you for a regular whippersnapper that morning.
Yeah, but I liked your gall.
- John.
- Yeah?
I know, make a wish.
All right.
Maybe I ought to wish that Lem flunks his bar exam next month, hmm?
The store won't be the same without you, Lem.
- Well, John, I wouldn't--
I wouldn't plan on replacing me right away.
When whitey comes home, there'll be one professional man in the family, and I, uh--
I think maybe that's enough.
- Lem.
- Vi, I've had my day in court.
We both know that.
- Oh, speaking of whitey, you haven't seen the latest, John.
This was taken on leave in Paris.
- My, my, that is whitey?
- He's a captain now.
- Oh, and, uh, who's she?
- Oh, name is Nora Thompson.
- Nora, oh.
Well, the way she's looking at him, you'd think that--
- and you'd be right.
Yes, they're head over heels.
- My, my, where does time go?
[Chuckles] Yesterday he was snitching penny candy, and now look at him.
Look at me, another birthday.
[Chuckles]
Well...
Oh, I'm sorry, vida.
- Oh, that's all right.
Make a wish anyway.
- No, I don't have to.
I've already got it.
All I'd ever wish is to be with good friends, like you and Lem.
[Phone rings]
- Oh, I'll get it.
Go ahead and cut the cake, but wait for me.
- All right.
[Ringing continues]
- Hello.
Oh, hello, Mrs. seibert.
How-- what?
When?
Oh, yes, we will.
Yes, I'll call you back.
Thank you.
Thank you.
- All right.
- It's president Truman from the white house.
- What?
- On the radio.
They surrendered.
The war is over, Lem.
- What?
- The war is over.
The cease-fire was this morning.
- Here, l-let me get it.
- Hopes of all America-- indeed of all the civilized world-- are centered tonight on thebattleship Missouri.
There, on that small piece of American soil anchored in Tokyo harbor, the Japanese have just officially laid down their arms.
They have signed terms of unconditional surrender.
[Upbeat music]
- whitey.
Whitey!
- Vida!
- Oh, my dear.
- Hey, whitey.
- Lem!
- It's good to see you, boy.
- Oh, it's good to be home.
- Oh, you look fine.
Doesn't he look fine?
- Oh, you look just fine.
- Nora.
Nora, here they are, the two greatest-- well, meet my family.
Family, meet the bride.
- Bride?
Whitey, you big sneaker.
Congratulations.
- Thank you.
- Wonderful.
- Why didn't you write?
- Well, we wanted it to be a surprise.
- Well, it certainly is.
- Now, after you kiss the bride, we'll go have some breakfast and talk all about it.
And then we've got to find a house, and then I've got to find an office.
- Wait a minute, wait a minute.
First things first.
Welcome to our family, Nora.
- Thank you, Lem.
I mean Mr. siddons.
- "Lem" will do fine.
Well, let's get some breakfast, and then we'll get you kids settled, huh?
- Wait a minute, this is Saturday.
You have a hike today, don't you?
- Don't I always have a scout hike on Saturday?
- We're working on...
[Upbeat marching music]
- hey, that's a pretty big load.
Don't lift too heavy now, Jimmy.
- Hey, Lem, you need any help up there?
- No, I can handle it all right, Frankie.
Just get that truck unloaded, huh? take 'er easy.
Yeah.
- Lem.
- Hey, Frankie, what's been keeping you?
- I was delayed in town.
- Did you pick up that planking?
- Lem, I've got bad news.
- Bad news?
- It's Mr. Hughes.
Whitey asked me to come and get you.
- What happened?
- Now, uh, there is just one more thing, Lem.
This letter was dictated by Mr. Hughes when he became ill several months ago.
It has been incorporated as part of the will, and it's addressed to the two of you.
"Memorandum to vida and lemuel siddons,
"beloved friends.
"Having no family to whom this store could be left,
"it had been my intention until recently to bequeath same to my cat,
Arthur III."
"However, it occurs to me that
Arthur doesn't know the stock
"and would probably lose all the boy scout business,
"disliking boys as he does.
"It becomes necessary, therefore,
"to saddle someone with this store
"who can run it better than a cat.
"Although you are somewhat pigheaded, Lem,
"you have the most wonderful wife in the world,
"and she should make up for your shortcomings.
"This store is yours, vida,
"and yours, Lem.
"God bless you.
And don't give Arthur milk.
He hates it."
- Well.
- There are some papers that have to be signed before witnesses.
Could you two come to my office in the morning?
- Yes, yes, we can.
- He sure thought the world of you two.
Good night, vida.
Good night, Lem.
- Thank you, Leo.
- Good night, Leo.
Give my best to Mary and the kids.
- I will.
- Oh, Lem.
- Well, all I have to do now is run the store better than a cat.
- Well, better start home.
- Yeah.
Oh.
[Groans]
- Now, what's the matter, Lem?
- It's nothing.
I, uh--I, uh--
I just felt a little tired all of a sudden.
I'm all right now.
- I think I'm gonna give whitey a call first thing in the morning.
- You're going to do nothing of the sort, vida.
There's nothing wrong with me.
- Yes, there is.
- I tell you, there isn't.
- You're pigheaded, just like John said you were.
- Whitey calls me a mule.
I think I like that better.
Well, Nora, what does it say?
- It says you're an impossible patient.
- Is it a secret or something?
What does it say?
- You wouldn't understand it.
It's in code-- medical not morse.
- Well, why don't you say it, whitey?
The heart, huh?
Is it bad?
Whitey, answer me.
Is it bad?
- Lem, I'd say your heart will last as long as you live.
- Well, that's not very funny.
- Well, it wasn't meant to be funny.
You're not as young as you were.
- Well, that's a great medical observation.
- Lem, these are supposed to be the cautious years.
If you don't stop overdoing it, the next time might be real trouble.
- All right, first chance I get I'll-- vi, what is that?
- Milk toast.
- All right, whitey,
I'll make a deal with you.
I'll try to slow down, but I'm not going to eat milk toast yet.
- Slowing down isn't good enough.
You need a complete rest.
- Whitey, how can I rest now?
Who's gonna finish building the camp out at the lake?
Who's gonna get the free lumber?
And who's gonna get the free labor?
Will you both stop "lemming" me?
Who's gonna see that everything's ready for dedication day?
Who's gonna coordinate all the activities and who--
- Lem, the troop committee will handle all that.
- Oh, the troop committee.
They'll gum everything up.
No, no, I've got to get out there and take charge.
- You're going to stay right where you are.
- Lem, you're missing the point.
You're through taking charge.
- Says you.
- No, Lem.
Says the troop committee.
- The troop committee!
Now, what--
- Lem, please.
Be quiet and listen to him.
- We all knew how you were pushing yourself with those-- those pep pills and those patent medicines.
You'd never quit on your own, so we had to make the decision.
- Whitey, what are you trying to say?
- Lem, I've already said it.
You've got to give up the scouts.
We voted on it a month ago, but, well, nobody had the nerve to tell you, including me.
- Kicked out.
After 20 years, kicked out.
- Honestly, Lem, they're only doing it for your own good.
- And nobody's trying to kick you out.
- Of course not.
You'll still be a part of the troop.
We'll always need your advice and experience.
It's just that you won't have to do anything.
- You make me sound like I'm 102.
Who are you going to get to take over?
- Joe pickens maybe.
- Joe pickens from troop 1?
- Well, he's willing.
- He's just a kid.
- Lem, he's whitey's age.
- Oh.
Well, he's still 13 1/2 in my book.
- Lem, the troop committee voted on something else.
As a special tribute to you, we're gonna create the title scoutmaster emeritus.
- Of course, Joe did make eagle scout, didn't he?
Scoutmaster what?
- Emeritus.
- That's not in the manual.
- Lem, when did your troop do everything by the manual?
Let's go, dear.
- Go where?
- Other patients, sick ones.
- Good-bye, Lem.
- We'll be over after dinner, vida.
And keep him from swinging on the chandelier if you can manage.
- I'll try.
- Good-bye, Lem.
- Good-bye, dear.
- Good-bye.
- Thank you.
- Vi, just what does emeritus mean?
- It means you keep the title of scoutmaster as a deserved honor.
- And sit here in my big overstuffed armchair while nothing happens out at the camp.
The roof isn't even on the cabin for dedication day.
- Lem.
- They-- okay.
A deserved honor, huh?
- And they mean it.
- Scoutmaster emeritus.
That doesn't, uh, sound too bad, does it?
Oh, vi.
- Lem, it's almost 1:00.
Hi, Lem, you ready?
- Yes, we're ready.
- Ten-hut!
- Hey, what's this?
[Bugle plays]
- hello, dear.
- Oh, vida, you look lovely.
- Oh, thank you.
- Let's not overdo it, huh, fellas?
- How are you, Lem?
- Well, I'm healthy enough to get myself into a car without an honor guard.
- The dedication committee thought it would look better.
- Yeah, some dedication.
You'd think at least one of the old scouts would have showed up.
- Well, maybe they will, dear.
- Well, if they'd been in town, they would have phoned, wouldn't they?
I'll bet the dedication committee didn't even write them a letter.
- Oh, we wrote them, Lem.
Every one of them.
- Well, probably forgot to put in the date.
[Bugle plays]
[cheering]
- Excuse me, Lem.
I got to get over there.
[Marching band plays]
- good lord.
Vi, what is it?
[Cheering]
- It's Lem siddons day.
- I just can't believe it. vida, look.
They're here, all the guys from the old troop.
Hi, fellas!
[Excited shouting]
There's quong.
Hi, quong.
And beefy. hi, beefy.
Hi, guys.
[cheering]
Vida, it's the governor.
- Hi, Lem.
- Hello, hoodoo.
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.
- Vida.
- Hello, dear.
- Whitey, Nora.
- Hi, governor.
- Had to call off a session of the legislature, but I made it.
- Good.
- I'll see you out at the lake, Lem.
- Yes.
[Cheering and band continue]
[Excited chatter]
- Congratulations, Lem.
- Thank you.
Thank you for coming,
Mrs. seibert.
- Oh, I wouldn't have missed it for the world.
- Hi, Mrs. seibert.
- Nice to see you again, governor.
- Hoodoo.
- Hoodoo.
Hello, dear.
- May I have your attention?
Can you hear me back there?
- Loud and clear, governor!
- Now, Lem, is gonna cut the tape, friends.
We'll march across the bridge, inspect the camp, and have the dedication ceremonies.
But before all of that, there's one ceremony that's been waiting
20 years, and it can't wait any longer.
You remember when we were kids, we used to get a kick out of that big book that Lem used to lug around, the one with the funny title-- jurisprudentia legis.
- Did you ever finish it, Lem?
[Laughter]
- We'd ask him what it was for, and Lem would say,
"that's so I can be a lawyer someday."
Well, because of all the time that Lem gave to all of us, that "someday" had to be postponed indefinitely, but not forever.
And now, by the authority vested in me through the state regents and the university,
I hereby confer on you, lemuel siddons, the honorary degree, doctor of laws.
[Cheers and applause]
[Marching band plays
 for he's a jolly good fellow]
- okay, counselor, you're on.
[Cheers and applause]
- There are so many things
I'd like to say, but it's-- it's a little hard to talk right now.
All I can say is thank you...
For everything.
I want to thank you, hoodoo, and, whitey...
And, quong, and, beefy, and, Frankie, and, Mickey, all the guys down through the years.
And I want to thank my wife.
All of you who've made my life the happiest life a man could have.
And, Mrs. seibert, a very special thanks to you for making all this possible.
Well, I, uh--
I guess that's all.
[Marching band plays
 for he's a jolly good fellow]
- these were made special, Lem.
- Well, all I can say is they ought to do the job.
[Laughter]
[Cheers and applause]
Well, what do I say now?
- What you always say, dear.
- Oh.
All right, guys, now let's shape it up in there.
Fall in and follow me, boys.
[Band plays]
All: Â¶ follow me, boys, follow me Â¶

09.00.
In a few short hours,
I was going into combat...
against my own children.
Anyone who has a child knows what I'm talking about.
That's the real war:
Our generation against theirs.
Standing on that deck, surrounded by thousands of men...
I suddenly felt smaller and lonelier than I'd ever felt in my life.
I'd been through this same Golden Gate when Frances had died...
and I'd come home on emergency leave.
Now I was back for good.
I'd left more than my heart in San Francisco:
Ten children, to be exact.
As we sailed under that bridge, I didn't know I was passing under my future...
because while I was going home to face my family...
Helen was bringing hers to a new life in a new city.
And don't think I wasn't frightened.
I had become a Navy widow.
I thought it was a good idea to get a fresh start...
where the surroundings wouldn't remind me of Dick.
But four of my surroundings looked exactly like him.
What troubled me more than anything...
was the kids seemed more upset about leaving their friends in Seattle...
than by the loss of their father.
It took me a long time to learn how little I knew about children...
especially my own.
As the ship sailed into the bay,
I took a good look around...
because I knew I'd completed my last tour aboard her.
My brother and his wife had been taking care of my kids...
but now it was Daddy's turn.
So I started down the gangplank...
certain I was doing the right thing...
nobly sacrificing myself for my children...
giving up my world for theirs.
Pulling away forever from ships and oceans and homecomings...
to take up shore duty.
Papa came marching home...
secure in the knowledge that they needed me...
and would be overjoyed
I'd come back to take care of them.
But they controlled their feelings beautifully.
It was the sort of welcome that could make any father...
review his position on the entire question of birth control.
Incredible as it may sound, they blame me...
for neglecting their mother all those years.
But it seemed to me there was enough physical evidence...
that I hadn't neglected her completely.
What they really couldn't understand was why I was allowing my brother...
and his wife to take Germaine and Joan away from the family.
Here you go, baby.
Come on, come with Uncle Howard.
Oh, you couldn't take care of two little babies, Frank. Not yet.
They'll be happier with us for a while.
I hope you can learn to manage the rest.
You've hardly been home long enough to learn their names.
I'm home now. I'll manage.
Don't you worry.
Goodbye, pumpkin. Bye, baby.
Don't give them any trouble.
If you live through this... the Navy's going to have to get a new kind of medal for you.
- Good luck, Frank.
- Good luck. You're gonna need it.
- Goodbye, Joan. Goodbye, Germaine.
- Goodbye.
Well, let's get something to eat.
They're not going to an orphanage, you know.
They'll be half a mile away.
You can see them any time.
Susan, Louise, come on.
It's only until I get things straightened out here.
And then what? You planning on auctioning off the rest of us?
Where would I find a bidder? Come on, in the kitchen. Let's get dinner.
Which one of us do you wanna cook?
The war was on.
I put an ad in the paper for a housekeeper that brought results.
The first one lasted an entire day.
The second one lasted seven days.
We discovered she was hiding from the police.
After a week with us, she turned herself in.
No wonder men go down to the sea in ships.
I'd have gone back in a life raft.
I had rented an ideal house close to the Navy base...
so I could work part-time in the dispensary, close to the school...
close to the playground and a little too close to the boy next door.
I was broad-minded about it, though.
I was gonna give that boy two more seconds...
before I went out there and broke it up.
I hate ants. I hate ants. I hate ants!
Come on, this is really stupid.
Listen, what are you doing? What are you...? You hate ants. Never mind.
Now, that belongs to her.
What is the matter with you?
You've been acting like this all week.
Mother, how's a person supposed to hear?
Colleen, I'd like to know what's going on between you and that boy.
And I don't care if he does look like
Paul Newman.
- Is the spanking over?
- No, it is not over.
Listen, what's gotten into you lately?
Where is that good little boy that used to live here?
I'll never be a good boy again.
I'm never gonna be good.
I don't wanna die.
What are you talking about?
Nicky told me that the good die young, and that's why Daddy died.
You can hit me and you can hit me, but I'll never be a good boy again.
Funny. Beginning of the school year...
had never been a problem to Frances.
The girls passed their dresses down from one to another...
and it all sort of came out even.
Have you ever been 5 years old and forced to appear in public...
in a dress that had three former owners, restyled by an old sail maker?
Five years old and no future at all.
And then one day, Frank and I just happened to run into each other.
I'd been wrapped up in my children for so long that getting this close...
to an attractive woman set my early warning radar pulsing frantically.
I was glad to have a reason for a second look myself.
You requisition those Fresnel lenses?
I'll answer that tomorrow.
The working day has ceased.
Just starting for me.
Drop me at the house.
Frank, do you realise that at this very hour... the Officers' Club is jam-packed with two-legged goodies.
We owe it to our brethren at sea to do unto others... as they would if they had our chance.
Darrell, it may come as a shock... but there are other things besides girls.
Yeah, women.
Now, don't tell me it isn't on your mind.
Any fella who has 10 children just doesn't quit cold turkey.
And if you'd only just...
Why don't you watch where you're...
Oh, hello.
Hi.
Well, old Sam the hermit gets out of the cave once in a while, huh?
She had my Cream of Wheat and I had her Post Toasties.
- What?
- Saw her at the commissary, that's all.
Frank, what's wrong with you?
You gonna be an old maid the rest of your life?
You really think that's what Frances would've wanted?
Probably not, but give me time.
Time? You're a borderline case already.
You may only have a few more cruises left in you.
- Come on in. I'll buy you a beer.
- I thought you'd never ask me.
You can stop worrying about me.
Things are looking up.
I finally found a housekeeper who seems to have staying power.
Soon I'll ask you to loan me your little black book, but right now...
Where you going, Mrs. Anderson?
Mrs. Anderson was last week.
I'm Mrs. Ferguson, and you can mail me my check.
She left her broomstick.
All right, what happened this time?
Who did what to Mrs. Ferguson?
All right, one at a time. One at a time.
- She and Louise had a fight.
- A bad fight.
Louise wouldn't come out of the bathroom for an hour.
She went in, and they were yelling.
- Is that strawberry jam on your hands?
- Raspberry.
I guess she started shaking her...
Or she slipped on the soap.
- Anyway, she fell.
- She didn't fall, she fainted... right on the floor.
When Mrs. Ferguson came out, I was kind of mad, and I had to push her.
Wait a minute. Hold it!
Louise fainted? Where is she?
She's in her room crying, and she won't come out.
We tried.
I think she's dying.
- And what have you been playing with?
- Ink.
Indelible.
Louise.
Louise, what in the world happened between you and Mrs. Ferguson?
I don't wanna talk about it.
Leave me alone.
Mary said you fainted. Is something wrong?
No. I just wish I could get out of this house and drown myself, that's all.
At least I'd be alone.
Let me take you to the dispensary, have them check you out.
No. I don't wanna see any doctors, and I don't want them to see me!
- But, Louise...
- No, please. I don't want to.
No, stop it! I don't want to.
No, put me down! I don't wanna go, please.
Stop it, I don't want to.
Mr. Beardsley?
- How is she?
- Oh, she's fine.
Nothing to worry about. May I talk to you?
Privately.
I forgot my Post Toasties.
We've scarcely met, but I feel that I must talk to you about this.
Of course.
Your daughter tells me that you're a widower?
Yes, that's right.
I'm awfully sorry.
Louise seems to feel the loss of her mother very deeply.
On top of that, she's going through a very trying time emotionally.
I don't quite understand.
Am I being stupid?
No, you're being a man, which is sometimes the same thing.
You can learn to do the shopping for the family... and maybe even do the dishes... but that doesn't exactly make you a mother.
Well, I'm not really cut out for the job.
Well, it seems that it's not been easy... for Louise to explain to you that...
You know... a tree can blossom in the middle of a busy city... but a young girl needs privacy... and she hasn't been able to find it at home.
So if she's been emotional or upset or even a little bit hysterical... it's because she's growing up and suddenly changing.
Is that all? Why didn't she tell me?
Because you would've said, "Is that all?"
She said that she's been very upset... about having to share her room at home, and...
Today, when the maid walked in while she was taking a bath...
- ...she was so embarrassed that she...
- Poor Louise.
Stopped being a little girl, and I never noticed.
Well, if it's any help, I understand.
I'm a widow, and I have the same problem in reverse.
Now I'm sorry.
Have you been alone very long?
Forever.
Almost a year now.
I know what you mean.
Dick was a navigator.
He crashed, routine training flight.
- Navy?
- What else is there?
Children?
They say it's toughest on the kids...
- ...but they haven't convinced me.
- I know.
And right now I think you have... a rather difficult assignment with your daughter.
I think you should go in and talk to her and take her home.
Thank you, Mrs?
North. Helen.
Thank you, North Helen.
- When are you on duty here?
- Afternoons. Five days a week.
Any of my kids get sick on the weekend, I'll hold them over.
Hi.
- How do you feel?
- I'm fine.
- Can I go home now?
- Sure.
Turn around.
- Hello.
- Oh, is this North Helen?
- Yes. Who is this?
- This is Frank Beardsley.
Oh, are you having more problems?
No, no. I just called to thank you for helping me with my daughter today.
Well, now, that's the worst reason
I ever heard... for calling a woman at 11:00 at night.
Well, I'm a little out of practise.
Well, as a matter of fact, so am I.
Oh, for heaven's sake, ask her out to dinner.
Who's that?
- What are you doing on this phone?
- I have to make an important call... and he gets off duty at the taco stand at 11:15.
Colleen, hang up.
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be.
I could never have done it without her.
How about dinner? Tomorrow night.
Well...
Mother, it's 11:14.
What time would you like to pick me up?
- About 1900?
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Good night, Helen.
- Good night, Frank.
Good night, Colleen.
Mother, don't blink.
You've got to let the glue dry.
But I look ridiculous with all this goop on my eyes.
- Mommy, you're beautiful.
- You sure are.
Thank you, but is it necessary that I wear these eyelashes?
I got your father without them.
- But you were younger then.
- Yeah.
- Here. Here goes the other side.
- Hold steady.
Okay, let me take it now.
- Mother.
- What?
Is he handsome?
I mean, in an old sort of way.
- Gee, I can hardly wait to meet him.
- Me too.
Let's not overwhelm him with family.
Not the first date, huh?
- You mean he doesn't know about us?
- Of course he does, darling.
All of us?
Mother, that's so romantic.
- You lied to him.
- I did not lie to him.
I just didn't have the nerve to tell him the whole truth.
I understand. No man wants a liaison with a woman with eight children.
- What's a liaison?
- An affair.
- That's what I thought.
- Me too.
I am not having an affair, and I'm not having a liaison.
I'm merely going to dinner.
As soon as I tell him about you... he'll bring me home in plenty of time for dessert.
Mike, see that it's lights out by 10:00.
- Ten o'clock?
- We're back in kindergarten?
- They stay up later in prison.
- Would you like to move?
When you finish with the slot cars... spend 10 minutes with your geometry book.
Flowers, Pop?
Is that corny. How do you expect to make any time with that approach?
We are just going to dinner.
It isn't going to be a love-in.
- You can say that again.
- No such luck.
Did you tell the lady you have 10 little children...
- ...two of them given away?
- You bet he didn't.
He'll hand her those flowers, then give her a snow job...
- ...on how lonely it is here at home.
- You listen to me.
Every time in the last year that I've dared take a woman to dinner... or been reckless enough to bring her home to meet you... you've done all you could to make her unwelcome. Well, I've had it.
I'm doing all I can for you, little as that is...
I think I deserve some consideration.
I suppose I'm being unfair. Who did this?
My generation is the givers, your generation, the takers.
Well, it's time to strike a blow for freedom.
From now on,
I intend to think of myself first.
If this be treason, make the most of it.
- But are you gonna tell her?
- Yes, I'm going to tell her.
You're gonna be a knockout tonight, Mom.
- Yeah, Mom, you're beautiful.
- Thank you, darling.
Good heavens, what did you do to this dress?
Mother, it was practically an antique.
We just shortened it a little.
- A little? I look like a teenybopper.
- Well, what's wrong with that?
- I can't go out in this.
- Why not?
Your legs are better than mine.
It'll be okay as soon as we shorten the slip. Give me those pins.
Oh, heavens. Jean, run downstairs... and tell Tommy to whistle the minute he sees Mr. Beardsley.
- But I wanna watch.
- Please, Jean.
- The minute he sees Mr. Beardsley.
- Will you stand still?
You'll get this pin stuck in you.
I'm put together with pins and glue.
If there's a strong wind, I'm in trouble.
- There he is. Hurry up. Hurry up.
- He's coming!
- Look at him.
- Wow, look at that car!
- He's in the Navy.
- Look at that jacket.
Look at those stripes.
He's got flowers for Mom.
- Yeah, blue eyes.
- Boy, I bet you that guy's rich.
- All right.
- No!
- Pass it on.
- The door.
Get away from the door.
Get away from that door. Get away.
Get back. Get back.
- Hello there.
- Hello.
Well, we better hurry. I know how you like to get places on time.
- I do?
- Yeah. Where are we going?
San Francisco. Little place...
I brought you flowers.
Thank you. Why, they're beautiful.
Shouldn't you put them in the house, in water?
Of course.
I don't know what I was thinking.
They're my favourite.
Beautiful night, isn't it?
I had a wonderful time at dinner.
I didn't know whether it was the food or Frank...
or the fact that I didn't have to do the dishes.
I couldn't stop talking. I told her about Frances, the Navy...
about the new carrier landing system I was working on.
I told her about everything but the children.
Funny how that never came up.
I guess I figured it would be easier over an Irish coffee.
While Frank was getting the drinks...
I was trying to figure out the most graceful way to break it to him.
By the way, I have eight children.
Speaking of eight children, that's what I have.
Have I mentioned that I have eight children?
I have eight children.
Well, don't look at me. I just got here.
Excuse me, please.
Pardon me.
That's all right.
- That's why I come in this place.
- What's your excuse?
Pardon me, sir.
- I'm sorry, I...
- That's all right.
- That's why I come to this place.
- What?
That's a line I picked up on my way back from the bar.
I don't know, you may have to drink this through your ear.
Frank, there's something I wanna tell you.
What?
That was a wonderful dinner we had tonight.
- I enjoyed all eight courses.
- So did I.
- Speaking of children...
- We weren't speaking of children.
- Thank goodness.
- Tonight, there are no children... in the world.
We're all alone on this desert island.
Just you and me and a native who makes Irish coffee.
I'll drink to that.
- Helen.
- Yes, Frank?
There's something I've been meaning to tell you.
- What?
- No, I want you to look at me first.
No, look at me.
- Just a moment.
- May I have a light?
Not on your life, sweetheart.
Ridiculous.
- Something wrong?
- No.
No, no. What did you want to tell me?
Well, this is the last time
I'm going to bring up the subject... but you do like children, don't you?
- Yeah. Yeah, within reason.
- In that case, the hell with it.
No. No, no, as long as you brought it up... there's something
I've been meaning to tell you.
- What?
- Well...
What?
- What's the matter?
- I beg your pardon.
- Something wrong?
- Yes. Yes, Frank...
I have this terrible craving for a cigarette.
I don't know what I'll do if I don't get a cigarette. I may have a fit.
Could you get me a pack from the machine?
What brand? King-size or regular?
Filter or non-filter?
- Yeah, wonderful.
- What?
- And hurry.
- Well, here, hold this.
Hello, nurse.
- Darrell.
- Well, Helen.
Hello, Darrell.
Your Irish coffee is winking at me.
- Darrell, help me.
- Does this happen often...
- ...or only during the moulting season?
- Hurry, please.
Now, don't you worry, honey.
I'm very good at this.
I've got an admiral with a loose toupee.
Coming through.
Pardon me.
I'm sorry.
Back for seconds?
Darrell, what are you doing here?
Chaperoning?
Oh, no, I've been here since yesterday.
Haven't been able to get out.
You mean you haven't been trying.
- Cigarette?
- No, thanks. I don't smoke.
- What did you do to your eye?
- What did you do to my eye?
Don't listen to him. It's perfect.
Let's drink to the perfect couple.
Two people who have so much in common.
It's positively nauseating.
To our nurse.
You know, I just found out that she has a family of...
- Oh, I'm so sorry.
- That's all right. I'm used to it.
Over at Frank's, when they pass the soup, it's like Niagara Falls.
He probably hasn't mentioned it, but he happens to have a...
- Gosh, I'm sorry.
- Sure is a rough sea tonight.
Yeah, it's very crowded in here.
Yeah, speaking of crowds... you know, you two kids really belong to each other.
I just found out that she's the mother of...
Squeezing through... Who pushed me?
- Here, let me help you.
- Hey, if you two wanna be alone...
- ...give a guy a hint.
- Let's get out of here.
Sorry.
Frank.
What? How could you lose your slip?
Don't ask questions.
It's back there someplace.
Do something about that floating eyelash.
Oh, you are a tiger, aren't you?
Frank, before we go any further, there's something I have to tell you.
- Now what fell off?
- No, no, nothing like that.
I wish it were something that trivial.
Frank, I have eight children.
- Eight children!
- Four boys, four girls.
Different ages.
Frank. Frank, we're on a cable car.
- Of course.
- I get sick on cable cars.
- Wait till you hear what I tell you.
- What?
- I have 10 children.
- Ten?
Ten? Ten!
Three boys, five girls.
- That's only eight.
- And two on loan-out.
Frank, eight and 10 is...
Ridiculous.
Helen, let's get off this damn thing.
Now I'm feeling sick.
Frank, what do you mean,
"two on loan-out"?
Well, a man alone...
I just haven't been able to keep a family that large together.
My brother and sister-in-law have the two youngest.
- That's awful.
- That's what my kids keep telling me.
They hate me for it, and I'm on their side.
I wish you had known Dick.
- What was he like?
- Like you, in many ways.
All wrapped up in the Navy and his children.
And in you?
Frank, I wanna thank you for a wonderful evening.
It was nice knowing you.
It was nice knowing you.
- You know what?
- What?
- I'd like to buy you something.
- Oh, that isn't necessary.
Souvenir of our first and last date.
- How about that Buddha?
- Oh, no.
That looks like real jade.
- How about that little fan?
- Fifty-five cents' worth of memories?
That's a pretty little lady.
- You have excellent taste.
- Thank you.
This is a Chinese goddess... who confers her magical powers on all who gaze upon her.
- What is she called?
- Kuan Yin.
- What does that mean?
- Joyous symbol of fertility.
Wave him off. Bring him around again.
3-4-Paddles. Wave it off and bring it around again.
Why didn't you tell me she had eight kids?
Why didn't I tell you?
I got third-degree Irish coffee burns trying to tell you.
But don't you worry about a thing.
I've got a few less-crowded ladies who'll knock your hat off.
Let's drop the subject. I've had it.
You haven't, and that's what worries me.
- You've been in dry dock too long.
- Ask him to move the ball around.
Come in low, check the red cell and come on in.
3-4-Paddles, move the ball around.
Check the red cell and bring it on in.
It's no use. What girl is gonna want to spend an evening...
- ...with a man who has 10 children?
- A girl who doesn't know it.
- Want me to lie?
- Of course not.
- Don't bring the subject up until after.
- Here he comes.
3-4-Paddles. Nice pass.
Now, I know a quiet little
Japanese restaurant.
I'll make the reservations.
Madeleine Love.
Now, there is a girl who is definitely not a talker.
What sort of a girl is she?
Does that answer your question?
No, Darrell, and stop trying to arrange my life.
Helen, I'm surprised you haven't met him.
Make a fist.
I haven't done anything yet.
I was practising.
He's a wonderful doctor... the kind who scrubs for a date.
Tremendous reputation. Nine handicap.
Now.
No more dates.
Don't think of him as a date, think of him as a meal.
Now, I know a quiet little
Japanese restaurant.
I'll make the reservations.
Don't rush me.
What does he look like?
I hate to use the word "Adonis," but there's no other way to say it.
A touch of grey at the temples, very distinguished.
Is he tall?
He used to be a basketball player.
I had to lie, of course.
But anybody who knew Frank and
Helen knew they belonged together.
All I had to do was let them stumble over each other a few times.
You have to do that with the marrying kind of people.
So I told her that Dr. Ashford was about 6'2", 6'3".
A harmless little white lie.
I wondered if the doctor would be so attentive if I told him...
I had three children taller than he was.
Darrell's arrangement for my evening hadn't uttered a word...
since I pick ed her up. I had no idea what was on her mind...
until we drew up in front of the restaurant.
There. I hate suspense, don't you?
Now you know and I know.
Let's have a quick dinner.
Keep the motor running.
Darrell said we had a lot in common.
After all, you're a nurse, I'm a doctor.
What's your specialty?
Obstetrics.
Darrell had a malicious sense of humour.
I was upset that Frank had seen me with Dr. Ashford.
I don't know why.
For some stupid reason,
I had the feeling I was being unfaithful.
And Madeleine had only taken off my shoes.
The doctor's bedside manner was a little previous.
I was embarrassed to think that Frank might be watching.
He was.
You're not worshipping me.
Thank you.
Helen, I might as well be honest.
I'm a very lonely man. There are times that I feel I could kick over the traces.
- I'm not lonely at all.
- Give up this race for money.
- I'm the mother of eight children.
- Travel to all the romantic places.
- I have eight.
- If I could find someone to go with me.
- Doctor. Doctor.
- I'd like to find places...
I don't think you've been paying attention.
I said, I am the mother of eight children.
I've always admired a woman with a sense of humour.
Meanwhile, back at the ranch, it was round-up time.
That's a very handsome family.
- Very handsome.
- Thank you.
Excuse me a moment, please?
Oh, of course.
Dr. Ashford?
Wasn't that your date?
Yes, it was.
He had an emergency.
- Come on, I'll take you home. Hop in.
- Oh, no, I wouldn't dream...
- Madeleine doesn't mind, do you?
- Are you kidding?
- You see?
- Well...
She's my oldest girl. She's going with this boy who rides a motorcycle.
Has hair practically down to his shoulders... and I think it's bleached.
She never talks to me about him, never brings him in so I can meet him.
- I hardly know what to do.
- You can't tell her not to see him.
- It's like shooting off the starting gun.
- I know.
You know, she's barely 16, and when he brings her home at night... they stay outside for about half an hour, kissing.
Heavens to Betsy!
What will they think of next?
My Veronica, she's 7.
She's so boy crazy, I'm afraid she's gonna get married before she's 9.
She doesn't care about school.
Only thing she can read are pictures.
Yeah, yeah. Well, Tommy's almost 9. He can hardly read.
But Jean, who's only 7, reads better than he does.
I have that in spades.
Louise is 12, she corrects Rusty's spelling.
Well, Tommy can help
Colleen and Janette with their math...
- ...but he can't read.
- I don't believe this conversation.
Did you put something in my sugar?
I have a strange feeling
I'm taking a trip.
- How many kids do you have?
- Ten.
Helen, there's no reason for us to avoid seeing each other.
Well, I think we certainly could be friends.
The fact I'm a man and you're a woman doesn't have anything to do with it.
And then the papa bear said to the mama bear:
"Who's been sleeping in my bed?"
Oh, come on, drop me off at the exit.
Then you two can work yourselves up to a wild game of post office.
No, I couldn't do that to you.
Oh, please, daddy, I'd prefer it.
Ten kids?
I'm nervous just sitting next to you.
- Helen.
- Yes?
Why am I pretending? I want to see you again, and not just to be friends... and not just to talk about children.
- I want to see you again too.
- Know something else?
In spite of all the aggravation and the misery and the yelling...
- ...I'm glad I have 10 children.
- And I'm glad I have my eight.
And I'm glad I'm careful.
Between our work and the children...
we somehow were able to steal a few hours alone.
When every place we went was better because we were together...
and I suddenly realised the emptiness was gone...
and the world just might be worth living in again...
I knew it was time for the acid test.
I invited Helen to my house to meet my mafia.
Here she comes! Here she comes!
What does she look like?
Mean. You can see it in her eyes.
Frank, I'm frightened.
Now, don't worry.
I had a long talk with the children.
They're going to love you.
Who locked the door?
Sorry, Dad.
I'll talk to you later.
Well, group, this is Mrs. North.
- Helen.
- You know Louise.
- Oh, yes. Hello, Louise.
- Hi.
- And Mike.
- Mike.
- And Rusty and Rosemary.
- Hello.
- Susan.
- Hello, Susan.
- Veronica.
- Hello, Veronica.
- And Greg.
- Greg.
You've met the family...
- ...why don't we have a drink.
- Frank.
- Yeah?
- This is only seven.
Mary. Where's Mary?
She's hiding.
Mary, come on, let's not play games.
Hello, Mary. I'm Aunt Helen.
You are not! I don't want another mother!
I don't want another mother!
Frank, I think I'm ready for that drink now.
Mike, you think you can handle the bar?
What would you like, Aunt Helen?
I'd like a light screwdriver, please.
Very light.
That's orange juice with a shot of vodka.
- I know, Dad.
- I'm sorry. I'll have Scotch and water.
I know, Dad.
I keep forgetting Mike is 18.
Frank, do you really think it was a good idea, my coming here?
Of course. If you hadn't, you might have been hit by a truck.
Everything's gonna be all right.
You're sitting on my painting!
Oh, I'm sorry, dear.
It's all right.
- You wanna fill that with orange juice?
- Who's it for?
- Aunt Helen.
- Mike, these are finished.
Susan's gonna help you.
Susie, take these in there, will you?
Thank you.
Okay, I'm gonna put these on the table.
Hey, Rusty.
- You wanna be a cocktail waitress?
- All right. Which is which?
Aunt Helen, Uncle Daddy.
- What's this?
- An alligator.
- A flying alligator?
- See the two little babies?
Two little babies.
And these are from Mars, I suppose.
They're very good. Oh, thank you. Rusty?
Hold it, Susan.
How about a toast to our guest, everybody.
Through the teeth and over the gums.
Look out, stomach, here it comes.
Hold the Dylan Thomas till later, Greg.
To our charming dinner guest...
- ...welcome aboard.
- Thank you. Thank you.
It's delicious.
That's just wonderful.
And where was Veronica born?
- In Japan.
- In Japan.
I call her my little fortune cookie because she came right after dinner.
That's funny.
Where's the fire?
Dinner is served.
Oh, dinner is served.
I want you to know Rosemary and Louise cooked this dinner.
Oh, wonderful, wonderful, wonderful.
That's absolutely wonderful, Rosemary.
- I'm Susan.
- Oh, of course you are.
- And don't you ever change, honey.
- Let's go, Susan.
You have a wonderful family.
They're all just wonderful.
Absolutely wonderful.
Wonderful, wonderful, beautiful children.
Just so wonderful.
Watch that first step. That's a dilly.
Greg, will you hold the chair for our guest?
Sure.
Thank you, Greg.
Thank you, Greg.
- I'm hungry!
- Veronica.
Bless us, O Lord...
Pardon me.
And these, thy gifts, which we are about to receive...
Pardon me.
From thy bounty through Christ our Lord.
Amen.
- You all right?
- Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful.
I'm hungry. Can I have a potato?
Pass it around.
- I'm hungry!
- I want some bread.
- Hey, come on, I want the bread.
- Can I have some milk?
Here, want some milk?
I can do it myself.
Sure, you can do it yourself.
Certainly you can.
Sure you can.
Boy, is it warm in here!
Don't you think it's warm in here?
- Want some potatoes?
- Yes.
There we go.
- You want some potatoes?
- Okay.
- Okay, there you are.
- Hey! You got it on my dress!
I'm...
Oh, good heavens!
Oh, I'm so...
I'm sorry, honey. Oh, I'm so sorry. I...
Rosemary, help Veronica get cleaned up.
- I didn't mean it.
- I'll clean her up.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I don't know what's wrong with me.
What a terrible thing to do.
I'm...
I'm sorry.
Dick, I feel sick again.
- It's Frank.
- Oh, Lord, what have I done?
- You haven't done anything.
- Yes, I have.
I've fallen in love, that's what I've done.
I promised myself
I'd never fall in love again.
And I wanted to make such a good impression on you... and your children, and now
I've been acting like an idiot.
And I don't know why.
I don't know why.
I just feel...
Oh, if this damn room would stop rolling around, maybe I could find...
- ...someplace to be sick.
- Louise... you better show Mrs. North the bathroom and help her.
- This way.
- I don't know why.
I don't know why.
The court of inquiry is now in session.
You didn't have to wait dinner for me.
We've decided to use our company manners.
Helen, the boys have something to tell you.
Mrs. North, I apologise for putting all that gin in your drink.
Oh, that's what did it.
And I apologise for all that vodka.
And I apologise for the Scotch.
Scotch, vodka and...
Helen, you've been the victim of an alcoholic Pearl Harbor.
It's amazing you survived at all.
Your bartenders will be dealt with later.
Oh, please.
Please, Frank, don't blame them.
At least what they did was honest.
They don't want another mother, and I don't blame them.
And you, Frank...
Frank, I think you should be on your ship at sea.
That's where you belong.
And if the children don't want me, I understand.
Now, hear this.
My interest in you has nothing to do with securing a mother for my children.
They don't deserve anyone as good as you.
Furthermore, I have no desire to go back to sea.
In fact, if you'll have me, Helen...
I'll be happy to remain ashore forever... because I happen to love you.
And nobody put anything in my drink.
- Frank, do you mean that?
- Of course I mean it.
That's why I said it in front of so many witnesses... untrustworthy though they may be.
Oh, Frank.
I give it six months.
It was a typical wedding.
Enemies of the bride on the right, enemies of the groom on the left.
I've seen firing squads with more compassion.
When I saw all the children lined up...
I wondered if Frank and I really had the right to do this to them.
All you had to do was look at those faces to guess what they were thinking.
All those photographers outside...
they're gonna plaster our pictures all over the newspapers and TV.
We won't be a family, we're going to be a freak show.
When the kids at school find out about this, I'm gonna kill myself.
I wonder why they're getting married.
Can there possibly be a physical thing between them too?
At their age?
She has mean eyes.
How can I do it to them?
How can I do it to Frank?
All I have to do is be very calm, turn around and run.
On your mark, get set...
Helen.
Damn the torpedoes. Full speed ahead.
- Here.
- What do you do with this?
Throw it, stupid.
Hey!
Cut it out!
The snow came a little early this year.
He started it!
That's no way to act at a wedding.
That's not nice!
Don't worry.
We'll take care of the children.
- Sure. Even if it kills us.
- It's only for the weekend.
We'll be back Monday. Goodbye, Janette.
- Goodbye, Mommy.
- Be a good girl.
- Goodbye, Tommy.
- See you.
Goodbye, Greg.
Goodbye, Mike.
Goodbye, Jean.
Goodbye, Veronica. Goodbye, Mary.
Goodbye, Louise. Bye, Jean.
You already kissed me.
Oh, I'm sorry.
By the time they finish saying goodbye, the honeymoon will be over.
Goodbye, Colleen.
Take care of the little ones.
Goodbye, Phillip. What's that?
Nothing.
Maybe pneumonia.
Oh, good heavens. Frank. Frank?
Frank, tell me if you think he has a fever.
I do it back here.
- He might.
- Oh, dear.
- Do I have to go to school?
- Frank, I can't leave if Phillip's sick.
Never in our entire married life will all of our kids be healthy at the same time.
But last year he had asthma.
His lungs haven't been too...
- What's the matter?
- Something's wrong with Phillip.
Get him to bed. Call the doctor.
We'll phone you... soon as we check into our hospital. I mean, our hotel.
If it's the flu, call me right away. If it's anything more serious, I'll call you.
No, I couldn't do that. I wouldn't know.
Well, I better call you every hour.
Make him stay in bed, and until you're sure what he has... keep the other children out of the room.
Be sure and tell the doctor that he's allergic to penicillin... all of the sulphas and some of the mycins.
- Also tell him that last year he had...
- Helen.
We'll go away some other time.
Oh, Frank, thank you.
I thought I saw the house cringe as we drove up.
It had been a dignified old Victorian home when Frank and I found it.
The only one large enough that we could afford.
The plumbing wasn't the most modern, the roof had to be repaired.
But we had both fallen in love with it when we learned it had four bathrooms.
So in we marched: The bride, the groom...
one bottle of champagne...
And 16 children.
Come on, darling, finish your tea.
Mother's tired and wants to go to bed.
Now, is there anything else you want?
Yeah, I wanna go home.
We are home, dear.
This is where we live now.
Then why can't I be Phillip anymore?
Well, who says you can't be?
That man.
- Frank?
- Yes.
And he says my name is 12-Blue-D.
And if I forget I'm 12-Blue-D,
I can't get into the bathroom.
Well, now, that's nothing to be upset about, darling.
That's just a system that he learned in the Navy.
Now, you stop worrying.
I'm going to find out what's keeping that doctor. You stay in bed.
There you are, Janette. You are 8-Red-B.
And, Mary, you are 14-Red-C.
- Veronica.
- What am I, again?
You're 14-Red-C.
Everybody's got a number from the oldest to the youngest.
All the bathrooms are a colour, all the bedrooms are a letter.
And that makes you number 14, bathroom Red and room C.
And this chart shows you where it all is.
Could you just point?
It's right around the corner, down the hall, love.
Thank you.
And, Veronica, you are 13-Red-A.
- Thank you.
- You are welcome.
Well, skipper, how goes the battle?
They're fighting it, but you can't beat the system.
- I'm sorry if I upset your wedding night.
- I thought it was yours too.
I didn't wanna sound anxious.
Susan, you are 9-Red-A.
If I can find it.
Champagne iced?
Yes, it's in our bedroom, in a shiny new bucket.
- Louise, you are 7-Red-C.
- All right.
If we stay on schedule, my system will have these kids bedded down... in a half-hour, and it's our turn next.
Greg, you are 6-Blue-B.
Aye, aye, sir.
I'll send up a flare if I get lost.
- How's Phillip?
- That's what I'd like to know.
- What's keeping that doctor?
- Probably the rain.
Tommy, you are 10-Blue-D.
Why can't I have my own room to myself, like Mike?
You're not the oldest. Next.
You mean because I'm not in your family.
- Tommy!
- Now, look, you're all in my family.
You have a beautiful room, D. It's around the corner, down the main hall.
Honey, wait. That's where Phillip is.
- Phillip?
- Yes.
Yes, number 12. You're right.
I know he has the flu.
No one should sleep in there.
That's the beauty of this system.
It can be changed in an instant.
All right, now hear this. Now hear this.
All C's and D's report to the quarterdeck.
There's been a slight rearrangement.
It may affect B.
Everybody back!
All right, lights are out for a minute. Don't worry... we have some emergency candles right in here.
- Helen.
- Yes, dear.
Frank, do you think there's a power failure all over or just in the house?
Greg, take these downstairs.
Get some light downstairs.
Where's 6-Blue-B?
I found my room, but there's rain coming through the roof.
That's not possible.
They just finished re-shingling.
Well, they'll finish on Monday.
- I'll go get some pots and pans.
- How old is this house?
Never mind. It's gonna be beautiful.
- Take care of the little ones.
- Sister's locked in the bathroom.
- What sister?
- I don't know her name yet.
But she can't get out and we can't get in. And it's my turn.
Oh, my God, I'm too late.
No, doctor, we're not praying.
The lights went out.
Come on in. I'll give you a candle.
What happened to the key?
It fell out and the lights went out and I can't find it.
- Well, light your candle.
- I came in here before the candles.
Well, look, I'm gonna pass you a match through the keyhole.
You light it, find the key and unlock the door, okay?
Okay.
Here comes the match. You see it?
- Got it?
- I got it.
- Well, light it.
- I can't.
Why not?
Mommy won't let me play with matches.
- Helen!
- Yes, dear, I'm coming.
Tell her it's all right to light a match, find the key, open the door.
- Who's in there?
- One of yours.
The one that's not allowed to light matches.
Oh, Jean. Jean, darling, it's all right to light a match this time, sweetheart.
All right, show's over.
Everybody back to your room.
Go back to your room.
You go back. You go back.
- I'm the doctor.
- Hold your candle higher, will you?
Jean? Jean, darling.
I did it, I did it.
- You certainly did.
- Here's your flashlight.
Now, go to your room, dear.
I'm 11-Red-A. I'm 11-Red-A. I'm 11-Red-A.
Concussion?
Oh, no, no. It's not her, it's my...
Our boy Phillip.
I don't know whether I'm 14-Red-X or what.
How do you get any food around here?
What's the name of this organisation?
No, I'm sorry it's a little confusing, but, you see... we were just married today.
Congratulations. The next
20 years ought to be a lulu.
- It's our room!
- Get out!
Oh, no. You'll have to excuse me.
You go right down there.
You can say that again.
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
It's our room!
What are you two boys doing in here?
- It's our room.
- Yeah, room B.
Janette, Colleen, I'm surprised at you.
- Get out of the boys' room this instant.
- But it's our room.
It's on that board!
We're on the board too, you know!
Get out of our room!
Hey, knock it off!
What's going on in here?
What is this?
Your blues and greens are wonderful, but your he's and she's are mixed up.
Thank goodness. Let there be light.
All right, boys, pack your gear together.
We'll straighten this out.
Get your stuff together.
- Girls, come on, get to bed.
- I can't find my pyjamas.
- Well, sleep without them one night.
- I'd rather die.
You don't care what happens to our family, do you?
- Colleen.
- Mommy! Mommy!
There's a man trying to take everybody's temperature.
- Oh, good heavens.
- All right, come on, let's get organised.
Oh, you found him, doctor.
No, that's not him. This one doesn't have a temperature either.
But that's Phillip.
He's the one that's sick.
Pulse, normal. Blood pressure, normal. Temperature, 98.6.
In medical school, they told us that means healthy.
Phillip.
I feel better now. He's a good doctor.
Good news, Mr. Beardsley.
Your son's not sick at all.
Oh, great. But keep it quiet.
I'll never get the C's and D's back into B.
Sorry.
Would you do me a favour and call my wife... and tell her I'm on the way home?
- Tell her thank you.
- For what?
We don't have any children.
- Is this the Beardsleys' new house?
- We've come to deliver the babies.
Have a heart.
Leave them on somebody else's doorstep.
Here we go.
Dad! Dad! Come quick!
They've brought Joan and Germaine home.
Come on. Come on.
Joan! Germaine!
Hi, everybody.
It sure was nice of you to bring them in the rain.
Blame your crazy father. He insisted the family had to be complete tonight.
When he used that Navy voice, we didn't wanna be court-martialed.
They can't argue, and I needed someone here on my side.
- Let me see that little angel.
- Bye-bye.
- We'll bring their things in the morning.
- Thank you, Nancy. Good night.
Good night, Helen. Good luck, Frank.
What a little doll.
Well, Murderers' Row is now complete.
- Can I hold my sister?
- Let's get one thing straight.
There's no more "mine" and there's no more "yours."
From now on, everyone and everything is ours.
All right, troop, to bed, to bed.
- Is this our house now?
- Yes, dear.
Can we invite some friends over?
Mrs. Beardsley.
Hey, you look beautiful.
- You mean for a mother of 18?
- I mean for a bride.
Frank, this is gonna sound silly, but you know something?
- I'm nervous.
- You know something? So am I.
What did that girl say about you?
You are a tiger.
A slightly grey, slightly middle-aged, but very much in love tiger.
Oh, Frank. Frank, do you think it can work out?
Will we ever, ever really be just one family?
Of course, but it's up to you and me to set an example... tonight, in togetherness.
There's rain coming in our room.
- Can we sleep here?
- Please?
Hey. I'm not gonna sleep in that big room all alone... if I'm not even sick.
Togetherness.
Every morning at four bells, our day began.
After all, running a family of 18 children isn't simple...
but it can be done.
The secret is organisation.
A job for everyone and everyone on the job.
I was always the first one to spring into action.
Mutiny was simply not tolerated.
My crew grumbled but obeyed.
They knew their captain only did what was best for all.
Up anchor, man the mizzen, fire when ready.
Mission accomplished.
Tommy's job was to check the weather report...
to determine the uniform of the day.
Twenty percent chance of rain.
My job was to brush my teeth.
It wasn't easy.
Maybe if he'd helped me sooner, they wouldn't be falling out.
Even without teeth, breakfast at the Beardsleys' included...
5 pounds of bacon...
2 gallons of oatmeal...
three dozen eggs...
and 40 pieces of toast, unless I missed.
And that was only to hold them until lunch.
Which they couldn't prepare without the old skipper.
After 20 happy years in the Navy,
I had at least learned how to deal.
Breakfast was the best meal of the day, if you had long arms.
I don't care much for eggs anyway.
And I can live without bacon if I have to.
Although some people are pigs about it.
But if a fellow can't even have a piece of toast, he's finished.
I could starve to death right at this table...
and nobody would even stop eating.
- School bus is coming.
- Get your rain boots on!
Phillip, stop dawdling.
Now, come on, dear.
There was nothing else to do.
I had to invent the oatmeal sandwich.
Come on, Phillip.
This is where my system proved so valuable.
The rain boots were all in one closet, where they could be reached instantly.
We had learned to buy boots and shoes and clothes in wholesale lots.
Sizes didn't matter, because eventually everything fit everybody.
Almost everybody.
Don't worry, fella, just keep growing.
Someday you can fill my boots.
That's my brother.
We got some wild things planned.
You've gotta come. It'll be out of sight.
- Hi, Larry.
- Hey.
The gang is throwing a freak-out tonight at the beach house.
Tell your parents we're going to a movie.
Oh, Larry, I couldn't.
Here we go again. Why not?
- I heard about those parties.
- I can't wait to find out if it's true.
Well, I'm not going.
- You are unbelievable.
- I am?
It's that ridiculous family of yours.
You're medieval.
You're so hung up, it's pathetic.
Do you know what you are? A sex maniac.
If I'm a sex maniac, I'm the most frustrated sex maniac in the world.
- And I'm almost out of high school!
- Big deal!
That's fine. All right, children... finish up your problems and bring in your papers.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Phillip.
You didn't sign your paper properly.
- Your name is Phillip North.
- I'm Phillip Beardsley.
We all went to church and we were all married.
- I'm Phillip Beardsley.
- No, dear, not legally... and we must sign our legal names in school, mustn't we?
- Beardsley.
- No, dear, North.
- North! North! North!
- Beardsley! Beardsley! Beardsley!
I got here as fast as I could,
Sister Mary. What is it this time?
Why don't you ask Phillip.
Phillip.
- Darling, what happened?
- Nothing.
- Who did that to you?
- One of the kids.
She started it.
- She says I'm not legal.
- What?
- And Mike isn't my brother.
- Of course he's your brother.
- Then my name is Phillip Beardsley.
- Phillip North.
There she goes again.
Sister, couldn't you just call him
Phillip Beardsley?
I'm sorry, but the school requires that we use their legal names.
Let's go to another school.
I understand your legal problem, but you must try to understand mine.
You see, I'm trying to bring two families together... and this is the first sign that I may be succeeding.
I really would appreciate it if you'd let
Phillip sign his name Beardsley.
But legally it's North.
But it's more important that emotionally it's Beardsley.
North.
- Beardsley.
- North.
Beardsley! Beardsley! Beardsley!
Watch out, Mom. You might get a black eye.
You mean, I adopt your children and you want to adopt mine?
Yes, that way we'll really be one family.
Your children will have a mother, legally... and mine will have a father, legally.
That way they'll be protected.
You know, in case anything should happen to either one of us.
- Strawberry or raspberry?
- Apricot.
Do you know that in California it costs $250 just to adopt one child?
- Really?
- That's a lot of money for a formality.
A black eye isn't a formality.
- How much milk?
- Twenty quarts.
Sixteen, 18, 20.
What we ought to adopt is a cow.
These are for Dad.
Two hundred and fifty times 18 is $4500.
- How did you figure that out so fast?
- Sheer panic.
Well, hello, Mr. Beardsley.
Should I wrap it, or you gonna eat it here?
All right, Harry, just call out the reserves.
Dave, Jack, it's an emergency.
The Beardsleys are here. More boxes.
Frank, you know what I'd like for Christmas?
- What?
- Don't buy me anything.
The most expensive gift in the world is when a wife says:
- "Don't buy me anything."
- Look, if we didn't... give each other Christmas gifts, and if we didn't get the new car... and we cut down on all the little things... the things we don't really need, the little luxuries... couldn't we afford to adopt our kids?
Thank you, Dad. Would you put these back there, please?
- Is that it?
- That's it.
Would you care to check it?
How could you decide something like that without asking us?
Colleen, we thought you children would be happy to be adopted.
Happy to forget our real father's name?
- Get lost in a jungle full of Beardsleys?
- Now, just a minute.
Mother, that's the most awful thing
I've ever heard.
He's gone a year, and you're trying to wipe him... out of your life as if he never existed.
And I thought you loved him.
- I like Beardsley.
- You be quiet!
- And no, I don't want any dessert.
- I'll take his.
Sorry, I didn't think I was committing a federal offence.
Thought they'd want me for a father.
Yeah, well, now you know what they think of you.
Stay out of it. It's their problem.
Now, wait a minute, Rosemary.
It's not just their problem.
I was planning on adopting all you children too.
- Was that part of the deal?
- Yes.
I thought everybody understood that.
We want this to be one family.
Excuse me.
- What's the matter with him?
- What do you think?
I gotta do my homework.
Homework? He's really shook.
Why shouldn't he be?
We loved our mother just as much as they loved their father.
I know that, Rosemary.
And now you're asking us to bury her again?
Who's getting buried?
- Come on, we'll get you washed.
- Excuse me.
I can't eat if everybody's gonna cry!
Frank, how could we have been so wrong?
- I feel like a murderer.
- Merry Christmas, everybody!
Merry, merry, merry...
Merry.
What a let-down.
I walked in here, full of the old Christmas spirit... ready to tell you the good news, and it's a disaster area.
What's the good news?
I could use some right now.
- Didn't Frank tell you?
- No.
Didn't you know you married Edison, the man?
- I am?
- That Fresnel-lens landing system...
Frank and I worked on has been accepted by the Navy.
- Frank, that's wonderful!
- It's only been accepted for testing.
Well, it's going on shake-down on the Big E.
- Hey, that's cool.
- When are you taking it out?
I'm not taking it out.
Since your father is anchored here,
I volunteered to handle it for him.
But, Dad, how come you're not taking it out?
It just might be I felt it wasn't right to leave my family.
But a shake-down, that's only a couple of weeks.
You always used to.
- Well, things are a little different now.
- That stinks.
- That really stinks.
- I'd rather not talk about it, okay?
Big mouth.
- Frank.
- You really sank the Navy, didn't you?
- Frank.
- Yeah?
You really do wanna go to sea again, don't you?
I'm not going to pretend.
There's no halo on me.
Sure, I suppose I'm a little envious of Darrell.
But when I signed on for this cruise,
I knew it was for the duration.
You make me feel as if I'm World War III.
Well, you shouldn't.
Helen, I want you to know something, if you don't already know it.
I'm happier than I've ever been in my life.
I've already gotten what I want for Christmas.
Thank you.
- I'm glad you adopted me.
- So am I.
He's been here! He's been here!
Santa Claus has been here!
Santa Claus has been here.
Santa Claus has been here.
Santa Claus has been here.
Santa Claus has been here.
- Santa Claus!
- Let me out!
Get out! Let me get to the Christmas tree!
Let me out!
I wanna get to the Christmas tree!
Frank! Frank, where are you?
You're missing Christmas!
Frank!
Frank! Where are you?
You're missing everything.
Frank, you're missing it! Where are you?
Frank, what are you doing in here?
- I'm an elf.
- But you haven't been to bed at all.
I've had six scooters, three wagons, a fire engine. This is the last bicycle.
- General Motors couldn't have kept up.
- Well, hurry up, dear.
Does anybody know where the package is for your dad?
- The red- and-white package.
- Here it is!
- Oh, thank you, darling. Thank you.
- Hey, what do you know?
Santa Claus brought so many presents he had to leave some in the closet.
Does it have my name on it?
For Phillip North?
I wrote him my legal name.
I didn't want any trouble.
Let's see, it says
" Phillip North Beardsley."
- That takes care of the situation.
- Oh, boy!
It had my name on it, all right.
We'll get an elf over here to fix it up. Greg.
Get off it, darling. He'll fix it.
- You're not an elf.
- Well, I'm practising.
All right, come on.
Frank, this is for you.
Well, go ahead, open it.
- Mommy, look what I got!
- That's beautiful, darling.
Susan, don't eat the ornaments off the tree until later.
I think Santa Claus made a mistake.
Maybe this is for Tommy, huh?
No, dear, I think this is for you.
- I don't get it.
- Bon voyage.
What are you talking about?
Everybody else got what they really wanted for Christmas. Why not you?
- Dad can go on the Enterprise?
- That's great!
Just a minute. Did it ever occur to anybody that I might know... where my duty lies and prefer to stay here, look after my family...?
Complain for a few more minutes, dear, before you agree.
I'm gonna answer the phone.
- If she thinks I have any intention of...
- How long?
About six weeks.
Well, when are we gonna sing
Christmas carols, huh?
Doctor, this is Christmas, not April Fool. Are you sure?
My dear Mrs. Beardsley, the reason
I am in my office on Christmas Day... is because I wanted to check the lab report personally.
You do not have indigestion, ileitis or diverticulitis.
What you have is a simple case of pregnancy.
P- R-E-G...
Doctor, if anybody knows how to spell it, I do.
- Thanks for calling.
- Merry Christmas.
- Who was it?
- Wrong number.
And so the skipper went back to sea...
protesting until the ship was out of hearing.
Darling, always the same, days speed by...
but the nights go very slowly.
You missed a wonderful day today.
Susan stopped eating.
A boy invited her to her first dance, and she insisted on buying this dress.
As you can see by the picture...
she's still got a few pounds to go before Saturday night.
Oh, what we girls go through for our men.
Dearest mother of 18:
Military security being what it is,
I can't tell you where we are...
but the enclosed photograph of Darrell and me...
may give you some idea. I'm the sexy one.
Mike's letter was from the president of the United States.
It said, "Greetings..."
Deep breath. Hold it. Exhale.
That's fine, son. Name.
- Michael Francis Beardsley.
- Hello, Mike.
Hi, doc. What are you doing at the draft board?
Sacrificing one afternoon a week for my country.
- How's your mother feeling?
- You mean my stepmother.
She's fine, I guess.
- No morning sickness?
- No, doc, I feel fine.
Not you, your mother.
Now, why should she have...?
Morning sickness!
- We need a sample of your blood.
- Take it all.
Hi, Mike. How did the physical go?
Well, they took inventory.
I had enough parts.
Mike, how do you really feel about the whole thing?
Yeah, I understand.
Where are the girls? Should you do that?
Why shouldn't I?
What's the matter with you?
Nothing with me, but I think you're out of your mind.
Does it show that much?
No, but guess who the doctor was at the draft board.
Oh, I ought to report him to the Medical Association.
No, he's gonna report you.
Bring that over for me, will you?
You knew about it Christmas Day, didn't you?
- And you still let Dad ship out?
- Yes.
Why?
He wanted so much to go.
Two people can't live with an ocean between them for the rest of their lives.
- If you write him about it, I'll shoot you.
- You would, too.
I'd just as soon he didn't know about this draft thing either.
Why not? Can't we tell him anything?
No, I'm thinking about the Marines.
That would drive him out of his skull.
Okay.
- Do you really want this baby?
- Very much.
You see, he won't have to worry whether he's a Beardsley or a North.
The Navy, like a woman, has a way of changing its mind.
Our short cruise was extended so often, we lost all track of time...
until one day when the mail plane caught up with us.
- Darrell, we're pregnant!
- We're what?
Mike's letter! Helen and I, we're gonna have a baby.
- Our first.
- Your first? Wait a minute.
You can't even count. No wonder it happened. When is she due?
When is she due?
The idiot, he doesn't say.
- Oh, no.
- Let me read Helen's letter again.
- Open some of those for me.
- Yeah, okay.
Here's one from Mary.
I can tell by the jam.
- Helen doesn't mention it.
- Phillip gave you a tooth.
Thanks. Colleen's in love.
What, again? Wait a minute.
What are we doing?
You've had enough training.
Can't you figure out the date?
It can't be soon. Helen would've told me.
Now, maybe she doesn't tell you everything.
Unless Veronica is an impressionist, number 19 is about to be launched.
I've gotta get on that mail plane before it takes off.
Veronica's artistic endeav our was not quite accurate.
A month later, we were still waiting for the stork.
Every night we would go to bed wondering if this were D-day.
Naturally, Helen was the most nervous of all...
and it was compounded by the tension about Mike and the draft.
She kept getting more excitable, anxious and emotional.
Why can't a woman be more like a man?
- Frank?
- What?
Don't make so much noise, you'll wake the children.
I just want a glass of water.
- Why are you making that terrible face?
- I have indigestion.
How often do you have that indigestion?
- About every 15 minutes.
- That's it!
Stay calm. Everything's organised.
Don't worry, everything's...
I've laid it all on.
Don't rush, now, Frank. I'm all right.
- There's plenty of time, but hurry!
- We'll get you there.
Stay calm.
Red alert! Red alert!
Red alert! Red alert!
Mike! Get the car out of the garage and warm it up.
- Nicky, get her bag, quickly.
- We've done this before.
Rosemary, Louise, Tommy... get blankets and pillows for the station wagon.
- Phillip, what are you doing?
- Going to the bathroom.
- What, is the stork coming?
- Maybe a whole flock of storks.
I never thought of that.
- Hey, Mike! What...?
- What's happened?
Hey, stop it! Hey, Mike!
What is this?
Will you knock it off. Now, listen...
Larry, what are you...? Mike! Break it up. Knock it off. What is all this?
Larry, why are you in our house at this hour?
- Dad, Mom wants you right away.
- Get the car.
I'm hysterical enough without your help. What's going on around here?
Nothing. That's the whole problem with your daughter.
Mike! Will you cut it out.
Look at you. You two, are you crazy?
My bike!
You all right?
What happened? Hey, man, don't you know how to drive?
- Look what you did to my bike.
- My mother's having a baby.
The bike's jammed under the car.
We may never get it loose.
Dad! Mom said they're coming six minutes apart!
- What are we gonna do?
- Get a crowbar and pry it loose.
- What?
- Not you!
- Daddy, can I go to bed now?
- Of course.
Please, I can't talk to Mother right now.
I've got to talk to somebody.
Well, talk fast.
Well, Larry says he'll never speak to me again unless I grow up.
He says I'm being ridiculous, and I don't love him. But I do love him.
- Am I ridiculous?
- You're not being ridiculous.
Well, do all the other girls, like Larry says?
And am I just being old-fashioned?
The same idiots were passing the same rumours when I was your age.
If all girls did, how come I always ended up with ones who didn't?
But it's all different now.
They wrote Fanny Hill in 1742, and they haven't found anything new since.
- Who's Fanny Hill?
- Go to bed, that's who Fanny Hill is.
- Ready, honey?
- Thank you, dear. Oh, boy, am I ready.
Frank, I think maybe you're gonna have to help me.
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm all right, dear.
I know this is a terrible time to talk about it, but Larry said...
I've got a message for Larry.
You tell him this is what it's all about.
- This is the real happening.
- Come on, Tommy.
If you wanna know what love really is, take a look around you.
- What are you talking about?
- Take a look at your mother.
- Not now.
- Yes, now.
It's giving life that counts.
Till you're ready for it, the rest is just a big fraud.
All the crazy haircuts in the world won't keep it turning.
Life isn't a love-in, it's the dishes and the orthodontist... and the shoe repairman... and ground round instead of roast beef.
I'll tell you something else.
Going to bed with a man doesn't prove your love.
It's getting up in the morning and facing the drab, miserable... wonderful everyday world with him that counts.
- Are you all right, Mother?
- Yes, dear.
- Now, you kids get back to bed. Go on.
- Go to bed.
- Good night, Mommy.
- Bye, Mommy. Bye.
You all right?
I suppose having 19 kids is carrying it a bit too far.
But if we had it to do over, who would we skip? You?
- All together, now. One, two, three!
- Come on, this is light.
- You got it out?
- God, that's a heavy bike.
- Okay, we got it out, Dad.
- Take it easy.
I'll get your legs.
Thank you, Frank. I never quite knew how to explain it to her.
If we don't get you to the hospital fast, the rest of it will be explained here.
See you later, Dad.
- Where's he going?
- Hey, Dad, the hospital is that way!
- Bye!
- Bye!
You'd think that was their first one.
Why don't you get a haircut!
Oh, I'm sorry, Frank, I'll ask the nurse.
- They won't let the children in.
- I told you, hospital rules.
Could you hold him up to the window so they can see?
- My husband says they're waiting.
- Of course.
Is my family out there?
Not only the family, he must have brought the whole neighbourhood.
That neighbourhood is my family.
Honey, you'd better lie down.
And if I were you, I wouldn't get up for three months.
Is he my brother or your brother?
He's both our brothers.
- Even to a nun, like Sister Mary?
- Even to Sister Mary.
Boy, is he lucky.
Petitioner Francis Louis Beardsley, step forward, please.
You are married to the mother of these children?
- Yes, sir.
- Has your wife consented...
- ...to adoption of the minor children?
- It was her idea.
If I'm gonna be adopted, why can't I talk?
Don't question the workings of a democracy, young man.
At least until you're 7.
- Has your wife consented?
- Yes, sir.
Will you execute an agreement in the presence of the court... that the children shall be treated in all respects as your...?
All right. Thank you.
That the children shall be treated in every respect as your lawful children... and shall hereafter be known as Colleen Marie Beardsley...
Janette Dean Beardsley...
Nicholas Richard Beardsley...
Thomas Roderick Beardsley...
Jean Louise Beardsley...
- ...Phillip Anthony Beardsley...
- I'm legal.
Gerald Joseph Beardsley... and Teresa Rose Beardsley.
Will you hand these to the clerk, please? Thank you.
Helen North Beardsley.
Yes, sir.
There's been great fear expressed by many people... that no one woman can give this large number of children... sufficient attention and affection... to allow them to grow up in a healthy atmosphere.
But in this court's investigation of your home, the reverse seems to be true.
All the children seem to be happy, well-fed and normal... the house amazingly clean and in good order.
My wife has two children, one poodle and a full-time maid... and can't seem to manage anything.
What is your secret?
Well, sir, a great deal of love... a little discipline... and a husband who doesn't criticise.
Michael Francis Beardsley...
Charles William Beardsley... and so forth and so forth Beardsley.
Will the minors step forward, please?
- Michael Francis Beardsley, do you...?
- Yes, sir, I do.
I haven't asked the question yet.
I leave for Camp Pendleton in an hour.
I was trying to speed things up.
Besides, it doesn't matter much what this court does.
You see, we held our own meeting yesterday.
If you're interested in democracy,
Helen North Beardsley... was unanimously elected our mother, for life.
Three cheers for Helen North Beardsley.
Mommy, pick me up!
Mommy, pick me up!
- Oh, here he comes.
- Here he comes.
Well, let's not get sticky about this.
Never saw you carry a bag for your mother.
- Mom's not in the Marines.
- That's what you think.
Mike, I know this sounds crazy, but it's gonna be lonesome around here.
With this mob?
Good luck. You sure you don't want us to drive you to the bus station?
No, thanks, Dad. I'd rather walk.
Bye, Mike.
So long, Mike.
- Now, you take it easy, Phillip.
- Okay.
I don't know what to say.
How about Washington's farewell to the troops?
Well, so long.
Don't everybody write at once, huh?
- So long, Mike.
- Goodbye, Mike.
Gosh. It kinda gets ya, doesn't it?
Yeah.
Well, we'd better hurry. We don't wanna be late for our appointment.
Hope they're expecting us.
Oh, they are... This time.
All right, gentlemen, we've all had our say, and we all agree on this one vital point, we are clamping a tight security lid on Professor Brainard's tremendous contribution.
- There's just one little thought, sir.
- It's not that we're edgy, but we've all been through the missile lag and the space gap.
We just don't want a "Flubber foul-up" on our hands.
The country's needs come first, sir, but if I could have just a little money right now...
Oh, you'll be recompensed.
Goodness knows, the Armed Services are never chintzy.
Now what we do, we beard the appropriations boys in Congress.
Matter of fact, I'm putting two of my bravest financial officers on the mission.
You understand, sir, the money isn't for me.
Our college is in financial trouble, and...
And you're turning everything over to them.
Professor, you are a fine, unselfish man.
It's a privilege to know you.
But just relax. No sweat.
The money is as good as in your hands.
Rendezvous, 14:00 hours, at Area 12, sir. The car is waiting.
Gentlemen, we've had a change of signals.
Schedule four is going in.
Time and area as briefed.
Well, Professor, I don't think we need to take up any more of your time.
We'll explore the entire situation, pro and con, set a figure and then lay out our grand strategy.
And then, one fine morning, we'll hit the beach on Capitol Hill.
Those money watchers'll go down like nine pins.
But isn't that all going to take time?
Certainly. We have to stockpile statistics, build up pressure, deploy our firepower so we hit them from all directions.
After all, we don't fight Congress with cap pistols, do we?
Well, no, I don't suppose we do.
Don't let those double-breasted suits fool you.
Those boys are tough.
Well, the thing is, we don't need all the money now.
Professor, I don't think you realize how important this discovery of yours is.
It's big. We've gotta handle it big.
Everything about it.
If you settle for chicken feed now, it's going to be a chicken-feed operation.
Everyone is going to lose face.
Everything is going to fall apart all the way down the line, and the free world loses another battle.
Is that what you want?
No, I wouldn't want that, sir.
Remember, you're in Washington. Stop trying to be reasonable about money or you're going to bollix up the whole thing.
- Well, I wouldn't wanna do that.
- Good.
Gentlemen, it is now 13:40 hours.
Let's move out.
You'd think those people at the Pentagon could at least have given us a couple of $100,000 out of petty cash.
What's gonna happen, Professor?
Everybody expects us to come home loaded with loot.
Yeah.
- Ducks at 12:00, sir.
- Oh, roger.
I can just see Alonzo Hawk licking his chops right now.
He's been dying for a chance to move in and tear the school down.
I'm sorry, Biff.
Sometimes I forget he's your father.
Oh, that's okay. I gotta face it.
Pop's the biggest loan shark in the state, and he's proud of it.
Let's just say your father is a very shrewd businessman.
Shrewd?
The only time my pop ever got the worst of a bargain was when he got me.
I just didn't turn out the way he wanted me to at all.
I don't know what we're gonna tell the Board of Regents and President Daggett.
This is going to break his heart.
Our new hall of science.
Isn't it magnificent, gentlemen?
And all this is possible thanks to Professor Brainard.
Medfield College has,
I believe the saying goes, finally come into the chips.
Why don't you just change the name of the place to Brainard College and have done with it?
A splendid idea, Mr. Hawk, though I realize it was offered in a spirit of irony.
I discussed the matter with Professor Brainard.
With characteristic modesty, he wouldn't hear of it.
However, he did consent to let us call our new science building Flubber Hall.
Now, to implement our physical acquisitions, we must search for gifted young instructors.
You mean more Ned Brainards?
We'll be up to our hips in crackpots.
This town won't be safe to live in.
I'm afraid we don't agree with you, Mr. Hawk. Do we, gentlemen?
No.
Aren't you all getting a little high and mighty?
When you couldn't meet my loan, you danced pretty lively when I talked.
Fortunately, a form of Terpsichore we no longer have to endure, Mr. Hawk.
Professor Brainard is here.
Oh, splendid.
Ask him to come in, please.
Gentlemen, would you be good enough to rise?
When Professor Brainard comes in that door,
Medfield College will embark upon its golden age.
Thank you, gentlemen, but I wish you wouldn't do that.
I mean you really shouldn't.
Nonsense, Professor Brainard.
Just a spontaneous little of our personal esteem.
I mean you, uh...
Well, you really shouldn't.
- Nothing wrong, I trust?
- Well, not exactly. It's just...
Well, things aren't quite as simple as I hoped they'd be.
So, they gave you the ole dipsy-doodle, huh?
They really sandbagged you.
They hung your hide up on the barn door to dry.
Professor Brainard, am I to assume that something has gone amiss?
Well...
But I thought they were delighted with your discovery.
Oh, they are.
It's just that...
Well, it's a little hard to explain.
May I?
Allow me to boil it down for you gentlemen, and you be sure to tell me if I get it straight?
Number one, the boys in Washington latched on to your little discovery, so you can't sell it anywhere else.
Number two, they're not about to give you any money until they think it over.
Number three, meantime, you've got no money.
How am I doin'?
Number four, somebody better lay 350,000 clams on the barrelhead, first of the month by 9:00 a.m. to pay off the short-term loan made to this college by the Auld Lang Syne
Insurance and Loan Company, or else exactly at 9:03 a fleet of bulldozers owned by the Auld Lang Syne
Demolition and Wrecking Company will start rolling through those hallowed gates and start flattening these ivy-covered walls in all directions.
Period.
End of story.
Very sad.
But, uh, personally, I'm crazy about it.
I can't believe you'd do a thing like that,
Mr. Hawk.
Oh, you can't?
Well, boys, it looks like
I'm calling the tune again.
Anybody care to dance?
I know how badly you must feel, President Daggett, but things aren't as bad as they seem.
I have this exciting new project
I'm working on...
Excuse me.
Mr. Hawk, I know we all want to give full attention to your point of view.
I'm sure we can resolve any minor differences that happen to exist at the moment.
Wanna bet?
Mr. Hawk, we know the welfare of Medfield College is very close to your heart.
As a civic leader...
Pearls!
Oh, I just love pearls.
How did you know?
I make it my business to know, Mrs. Brainard.
And now, little something to keep the chill off.
Oh!
Oh, you mustn't.
You really mustn't.
Oh!
Well, you don't think it's a little bit too fussy, do you?
Like you've been wearing it all your life, Mrs. Brainard.
To the manor born.
And here, the finishing touch.
How chic!
I knew you'd like them, Mrs. Brainard.
You look like a queen, a regular queen.
- An empress.
- A goddess.
I do, don't I?
This, as you can see, is a check for one million dollars made out to the Professor and yourself.
One million dollars!
Oh, but, Mr. Hurley, whatever for?
For a kind word, Mrs. Brainard.
Only a kind word.
You know, in a business deal, the right word from the little woman...
I'm a great believer in the power of a woman.
- How true.
- You really got something, Mr. Hurley.
Well, I don't know what Ned's going to say about all this.
For a space-age scientist, he's a little bit old-fa...
Yoo-hoo, Ned. Guess who?
Betsy!
Professor Brainard, my name is Hurley.
I've spoken to you on the phone, from New York.
- What I'd like to do...
- Betsy, what is all this the dogs and that coat?
Please take it off.
We can't afford that.
Now why don't we let the little lady enjoy herself?
Professor, I'd like to talk some business with you.
I hope you won't think
I'm presumptuous going ahead like this.
Mr. Hurley is a live wire.
He likes to act while other people are still talking.
Just a minute.
Who are all these people around here?
All part of your company,
Flubber Enterprises.
"Flubber Enterprises?"
Just a cozy little company we're putting together, you and I, to make things out of Flubber.
Professor, when you invented this stuff,
I don't think you dreamed what you had.
It'll touch the lives of every man, woman and child in the world.
Just like Edison and the electric light.
Now wait, I hardly consider myself in the same class with Mr. Edison.
Don't be so modest, Professor.
That's your trouble.
That's where I come in.
Now, I've worked up a few product sells here just to give you an idea.
"Flubbermint gum, it chews while you snooze."
"Flubberin, bounces away pain again and again."
"Flub away the flab with the scientific Flubbercycle."
"You'll wonder where your dentist went
"when you brush your teeth with
Flubberdent with Hexoflubberene."
And now I've had our agency boys work up a little TV campaign.
Show people what
Flubber can do for them.
Hit them where they live.
They'll wonder how they got along without it.
Now I don't want you to get the feeling that we're rushing you.
But the thing is...
- Howie, roll the film.
- Guess what this is?
A million dollars!
- Quiet, Professor.
- But, Betsy...
Hi there. Rex Williams here.
You know, my friends, down through the corridors of time,
as mankind has emerged from the Dark Ages,
toiling, ever striving upward, there have been turning points,
inspirational milestones, and we remember the great names of science.
Newton and the law of gravity.
Watt and the steam engine.
Edison and the electric light.
And, my friends,
Brainard and Flubber.
Yes, ladies and gentlemen,
Flubber.
For it was not too long ago, in a small American city,
that the discovery of Flubber burst upon a waiting world.
That was the beginning.
From those first crude basketball shoes came more shoes,
shoes for people in every walk of life.
But it was not to stop there.
True, now man had lifted himself up by his own boot straps.
He could walk with his head above the crowd.
But this was only the springboard,
not only to a vast new line of products,
but to a happier, safer way of life.
Friends, is your home a booby trap
just waiting to snare you the moment you set foot in it?
I'm home, dear.
Is your kitchen a savage jungle teeming with perils and pitfalls?
Dear, where's the first-aid kit!
Stop clowning, George.
You'll frighten the baby!
In short, is your family accident prone?
Then, friends, the time has come to flubberize your home.
Transform it from a booby trap into a love nest.
Make it safe for you and your loved ones.
Yes, flubberize your home with hazard-free flubberoleum floors.
Flubberoleum, in 16 beautiful decorator colors.
The foamiest, friendliest floor that ever fondled your family's feet.
I'm home, darling.
Hi.
- Darling!
- Sweetheart!
- Oh!
- I got him! Whee!
Yes, folks, you'd coo too...
If you belonged to this happy Flubber family,
the family who can say proudly...
They live in the house with the flubberoleum floors.
That's just the start.
There are hundreds of products we haven't even thought of yet.
I'm very impressed, Mr. Hurley, but...
Fine. Now if you'll just sign this letter of agreement.
That million-dollar check is the evidence of our good faith.
Well, there's just one little hitch.
I have a prior commitment.
A prior commitment? With who?
The government.
- Our government?
- That's right.
You just said the magic word.
All right, boys, pack up the gear.
Let's get out of here. The party's over.
I can't tell you how badly
I feel, Mr. Hurley.
I do have another idea you might be...
- Forget it.
- You've hurt Mr. Hurley very deeply.
- Oh! Oh!
- He is terribly disappointed in you, sir.
- Now just a minute. This is my dress.
- Oh! I beg your pardon.
If you'd just let me show you some of the plans I have in my lab...
- Mrs. Brainard, the check, please.
- Oh, please.
Do I have to give this back?
If you don't mind.
- No.
- Betsy, give Mr. Hurley back his check.
I won't!
Betsy!
This isn't like you.
Now give him his check.
- No!
- Betsy, give me that check.
Betsy.
Give it to me.
Thank you.
Oh, I'm sorry, dear.
I just lost my head for a moment.
But when you've been fighting with the grocer all month and you find a million dollars in your hand...
I suppose this half isn't any good?
Oh, very nice. Beautiful quality.
- Professor Brainard?
- Yes?
How do you do? My name is Harker.
I'm from Washington.
From Washington?
Well, am I glad to see you.
Come right in.
Thank you.
Darling, wonderful news.
This is Mr. Harker.
He's here from Washington already.
How perfectly marvelous.
How do you do?
How do you do?
It's very nice to know you, Mrs. Brainard.
May I take your hat and coat,
Mr. Harker?
Oh. Thank you.
You and your discovery have certainly created quite a stir down in our nation's capital.
- And you've come about the payments?
- You betcha.
You're quite a prize, you know.
The boys in my department drew straws to see who'd get ya.
- I'm happy to say I won.
- Well, thank you.
Now the thing is, Mr. Harker, we want most of this money to go to Medfield College.
Oh, but first, of course, we'd like to pinch off just a tiny bit for ourselves.
Just enough to take care of the household bills that have been stacking up for months.
- All right, dear?
- Whatever you say, darling.
I'm afraid you folks don't understand.
I'm from the Internal Revenue Service.
Well, if there's one thing we could use around here, it's a little revenue.
Yes, we certainly...
Internal revenue?
Your tax bill for the first three quarters of the current year.
The figure includes delinquent penalties of $12,895 at five percent for the first two quarters.
All based on an estimate of projected earnings, of course.
Oh, I realize that the estimate is low, considering the staggering potential of Flubber.
But Uncle Sam is willing to be understanding until you get your financial house in order.
But, Mr. Harker, we don't have 656 cents.
You don't say?
Let me explain, Mr. Harker.
You see, I turned my discovery over to those people at the Pentagon.
Now they put a top-secret classification on it.
I'm not even supposed to talk to anybody about it.
Yes. I know those boys at the Pentagon.
I used to review some of the General's personal tax returns. A million laughs.
Well, then you do understand.
Certainly.
Excuse me.
Now if you'll just give me a check for the amount on this paper here, please.
But how can I pay you if nobody pays me?
Well, I regret to say, Professor, that's your problem.
But... Look at it from our standpoint.
We've been counting on you.
We trusted you.
Uncle Sam needs the money.
You don't build those rockets to the moon with green stamps, you know.
Excuse me, dear.
Joey's here to collect for the paper.
- Do you have half a dollar?
- I don't think so.
Now you estimated your income for the current year at a million dollars.
Is this true?
Well, that was just a wild guess,
Mr. Harker.
We thought the money was going to come rolling in from all directions, millions!
We wouldn't be able to count it all.
There's ten cents.
There's another dime. That's twenty.
We'll have to owe him the rest.
He wants his money.
But you did make this estimate based on this tidal wave of money that you speak about.
That's right. There's another dime.
That's all I've got.
There's not another cent in the whole house.
You see, essentially, Professor, we have a trusting nature.
When a taxpayer makes an estimate, we believe him, we're happy for him.
We're rooting for him all the way.
Well, that's very kind of you, Mr. Harker.
Oh, Ned, I cleaned all the loose change out of there.
Oh. Well, we should have company over more often.
But Uncle Sam has to run his store on current income just like everyone else.
When the money he's counting on doesn't come in, he's very sad.
Now, in this case, the sadness is represented by a delinquent penalty of $12,895.
I found another dime.
We're still a dime light.
Then I'll just have to go and talk to him.
Uh, Professor...
May I?
Thank you, Mr. Harker.
Thank you.
Now, in addition to the six percent penalty, in the case of willful failure to pay your estimated tax, there's a $10,000 fine...
Or imprisonment.
Thank you, Mrs. Brainard.
I'll give you your receipt.
Professor, what is, uh, the little lad's name?
Uh, Joey Marriano.
And how many customers would you say he has on his route?
- Oh, I'd say around 30.
- Wait a minute.
What are you doing with that information about little Joey?
Uh, just a reminder to myself to put a spot-check on the lad.
A small thing, you might say, but you'd be surprised how much unreported income turns up this way.
But Joey's only seven years old.
You wouldn't take money from a child.
You know, Professor, your wife has a refreshing sense of humor.
We don't run into it often in our line of work, and that's a fact.
You ought to be ashamed.
Ah-ah-ah-ah. Sticks and stones, etc.
We do our part to keep the wheels of democracy rolling.
Warriors unsung, unknown, misunderstood.
If need be, I imagine you'd put your own mother in jail.
Funny you should mention that about Mom.
A little matter of some unreported income from jams and jellies.
We nailed her dead to rights.
Well, I won't bore you with shop talk.
Uh, one last little parting thought, Professor.
Should Uncle Sam really want to throw the book at you, we have some lovely punitive laws under section 7203, and section 6653, paragraph b, is a real Jim-Dandy.
Good day, sir, and a pleasant day to you, Mrs. Brainard.
Oh, Ned.
I forgot to kiss you when I came home.
I missed you.
I missed you, too.
You know all I could think about while I was there in Washington?
What?
I just couldn't help feeling sorry for all those people.
They have their problems, too, you know.
Now, you take that income tax man.
Ned Brainard, don't you dare, dare try to straighten out the government.
We have our own troubles, right here.
Sweetheart, I was only thinking about the welfare of our country.
Well, this is part of the country, isn't it?
This house is on United States territory.
We're citizens.
Now look, I don't want to appear selfish, but just once, can't we think about ourselves?
Betsy, I don't blame you for feeling the way you do, but please believe me, everything's going to work out all right.
But, Ned!
Now sit down, and hold your breath.
I have something of great importance to tell you.
Oh?
I wasn't going to tell you till I had it completely worked out, but if I keep it to myself any longer,
I'm going to bust.
Betsy, this is going to bowl you over.
I think I've managed to get hold of the weather.
What does that mean, you
"got hold of the weather"?
What it means, Mrs. Brainard, is that Flubber was only the key that unlocked a great storehouse of cosmic forces.
Out in that humble garage, from the residue of Flubber,
I found a gas.
I call it "Flubber gas," and I have reason to believe that with this Flubber gas,
I can activate a change in the molecular balance of the atmosphere.
It could even trigger off the energies which give us rain, snow, sleet, electrical storms, blue skies, sunshine, whatever, wherever we choose.
Do you realize what that would mean, Betsy?
It would mean that, for the first time, weather would become the slave of man, rather than his master.
It could change the future of the whole world, the history of mankind itself.
That's very nice, dear.
Very nice?
Betsy, this is the greatest...
Ned, why do you always have to do something so world-shattering?
Can't it be something modest that would bring just a few dollars into this house?
Like goop that would keep fingernails from breaking?
Or trash can lids that would actually fit the top of trash cans!
Trash cans?
Or some little machine that pays the grocer and the dry cleaner at the end of every month.
I'd say I could use a little machine like that right now!
Betsy, please be serious.
Do you realize what a wonderful age we are living in today?
Anything can happen.
Anything!
Forty years ago, even thirty years ago, if I said I'd found a way to control weather, no one would've listened, but today, do you know what they'd say?
I know what I would say.
I'd say I think the first impression that
I ever had of you was right.
What was that?
I thought you were nuts!
Look. We've got this big football game with Rutland
- next Saturday, right?
- Right.
And they're practically national champs, right?
- Right.
- Suppose we beat Rutland on Saturday.
Even my own father couldn't close a college that had just clobbered the national champs, could he?
Ah, Biff, how can we beat Rutland?
Our team is hardly strong enough to get itself dressed in the morning.
What do you think the suit is for?
Science in action, boy.
I haven't been hangin' around professor Brainard all semester just for kicks, you know.
What's this thing supposed to do?
Knute Rockne put new ideas into football.
Pop Warner put new ideas into football.
And now, Alonzo Hawk Jr.
Is gonna do his part.
- How does that feel?
- Hi, Biff.
Oh, hi, Prof.
Good. You've got the Flubber gas all hooked up, huh?
Just like you asked me to, sir.
Oh, by the way, Professor,
I'd like you to meet my assistant.
This is Humphrey Hacker.
Oh. Glad to know ya, Humphrey.
- Hi there.
- He wants to become a scientist.
Oh, not exactly.
What I'm really interested in is animal husbandry.
Oh, Humph, I wouldn't let you throw your life on a bunch of cows.
Sir, science needs brilliant young minds like Humphrey.
Besides, I needed a volunteer.
Volunteer? For what?
Sir, I hope you won't mind, but I'd like very much to borrow a little Flubber gas.
You see, we've got this football suit here, that...
Oh, so that's what it is.
Yes, sir.
Humphrey, come on, demonstrate.
When we get the Flubber gas, it would come through feed tube A and inflate shoulder pad B.
Then it would come through feed tube C and inflate shoulder pad D and then the leg pads, and so forth.
There's only thing, Biff.
Flubber gas is extremely violent, exceptionally powerful.
I don't know how much protection those pads are going to give you.
Protection, sir? Oh, we're not thinking about protection.
We're thinking about offensive power!
Well, look. Just imagine, sir.
The teams line up. The ball is snapped.
I take the ball, and I slam it into
Humphrey's stomach.
- Bam!
- Oof!
Now a whole wave of those big Rutland gorillas comes pouring in to smash him.
Fearlessly, Humphrey lowers his head and he charges right into 'em.
The Flubber gas reacts...
Zam!
Wham! Kersplunch!
Rutland linemen fall like ten pins in every direction!
Humphrey staggers, but he keeps running.
The Rutland secondary comes in just to smash him!
Boom! Pow!
Pow!
Like water off a duck's back, they bounce.
Humphrey staggers, but he keeps on running, and he's to the 30.
He's to the 20, the 10!
He's over for a touchdown!
Fans are going wild!
Yeah, Humphrey!
Yeah, Medfield! Yeah!
Yeah!
Whaddya think, sir?
Well, if first impressions mean anything, I, uh...
I think you're slightly nuts.
- Sir?
- I'm sorry, Biff.
I was thinking of something someone very near and dear just said to me.
Don't let me discourage you.
You go right ahead.
Oh, thank you, sir. We'll go on a crash program right now.
Pick it up, Humph.
We're gonna eat and sleep this thing
24 hours a day till we get it whipped.
- Let me know if I can help you.
- Thank you, sir.
Meantime, I'm on a little trash can...
I mean, crash program of my own.
Project weather gun.
Well, here goes.
First, we connect the circuit with the weather gun.
And we fill the circuit with Flubber gas.
Then we activate the pump...
So the gas flows through the gun at constant pressure.
Now the Flubber gas is violent, but we need even more violence, so we stimulate it electronically.
Yeah.
Now, let's see what we've got.
Hmm. Now let's see.
You know, Biff, this stuff is labeled "dangerous."
Oh, now, Humph boy.
Look, would I get you into a situation unless I knew exactly what I was doing?
Yeah.
That should do it.
That should do it.
I've never seen them so worked up.
When I bombard a cloud with a beam like this, it just has to lead to clustering.
In turn, leading to a transfer of particle momentum and the inevitable consequence, precipitation. Rain all over the place.
Now, for a cloud.
Not a cloud in the sky.
Not one single cloud.
Wouldn't ya know it?
Well, what have we here?
Range, about 30 feet.
Switch on.
Ready. Aim.
Fire.
It works!
Charlie Brainard!
Betsy. Betsy.
I did it! I did it!
- You did?
- That's right, sweetheart.
And that's only the beginning.
The next time, I'm going to flood the whole county.
It's a result of my fooling around with the molecular configuration of Flubber gas.
I'll get a mop and clean it up.
Oh, never mind.
Ned, I've had enough for one day.
All I ask of you is to get dressed for dinner.
Company will be here at seven o' clock.
Whatever you say, dear.
♪ Though April showers may come your way they bring the flowers ♪
Well, who's going to be here for dinner, Betsy?
Oh, didn't I tell you, dear?
No, I don't think you did.
Who's going to be here?
Now, I don't want you to be upset.
Betsy, who's coming to dinner?
If there's one thing
I'm certain you're not, it's narrow-minded.
Betsy, I would like to know who's coming to dinner.
It isn't as though he were coming all by himself.
Besides, he was such a good sport about our getting married.
You don't mean...
I don't see one single reason why we can't all be good friends.
We're adults, you know, not children.
You don't for one single minute mean...
That dear, sweet, kind, thoughtful...
Double-crossing, miserable, four-flushing snake...
Shelby Ashton!
Betsy, I think you'll agree that I'm a very patient man.
But old flame or not, if that no-good rat sets one grubby paw inside this house, I'll...
Ned, if you raise one hand...
I'll get it.
Nuzzie! Oh.
Evening, Professor. Hello, Betsy dear.
It's wonderful to...
Who is that?
As soon as they unglue themselves,
I'd like you to meet an old friend of Ned's.
- Desiree De la Roche.
- Now wait a minute. I don't know any...
Holy cats!
It's Mary Lee Spooner!
Of course it is, Nuzzie darling.
I'll be darned.
I knew you were vague, lover, but I didn't think you were that vague.
I'll be doggone.
Betsy, do you know who this is?
No, "Nuzzie," who is it?
It's Mary Lee Spooner.
You said that before.
Somehow or another,
I didn't get much out of it.
You must've heard me talk about her.
Mary Lee and I used to go together, didn't we?
It was long before I met you, Betsy.
By gosh, Mary Lee, you've changed.
What's all this
Desiree De la whatever it is?
Well, I've been married here and there, and, uh,
I picked up a name or two since I left Medfield.
And I've just been living in Paris all this time.
Paris, huh?
Didn't you know that?
I didn't know that.
I wondered what happened to ya.
Gosh, we used to have the times, didn't we, Mary Lee?
Betsy, there was one time when Mary Lee and I...
Well, I guess that's all water under the bridge, huh?
Why don't we go in the living room and try to make ourselves comfortable?
Yes, let's.
Betsy, why didn't you tell me there was a surprise for dinner?
Well, I hadn't exactly planned it this way.
Well, uh, Desiree was back in town, and I said to myself,
"Shelby, how about a grand reunion?"
As the poet said,
"Is not old wine the wholesomest,
"old pippins the most toothsome?
"Old wood burns brightest,
"and old friends are surely the best."
A lovely thought.
Mmm, yes.
That's très continental.
It's so interesting seeing the kind of girl Ned married.
Why, you and I aren't the same type at all.
Oh, what type would you say I am, Desiree?
Well...
A funny thing happened out in the lab today...
We're so different, you and I.
I'm the gay, irrepressible madcap flitting from flower to flower, and you're the nice, sensible little homemaker.
N'est-Ce pas?
The wonderful thing about Betsy is, she combines beauty with brains.
- Well, I'll drink to that.
- So will I.
I think Betsy's sweet.
I think she's just as sweet as she can be.
Thank you.
You know, I don't think you realize how lucky you are.
I had to go through three marriages before I realized that Ned was the kind of man
I was looking for all along.
Oh, is that so?
Sometimes I get all choked up inside thinking of it.
Imagine going all the way to the other side of the world when the bluebird of happiness was here all along.
Oh, I'm sorry, Desiree.
Still, it's nice to know
I've done the right thing.
Yes.
Poor, brave child.
I wish things were going better for her.
What do you mean?
Come now, Brainard.
There's no reason to pretend with us.
Everyone knows Medfield College is about to go down the drain.
Where does that leave you?
What's it to you?
It so happens I have just been made
Head of the English department of Rutland College.
It's a very complex and demanding job.
I'd like to ask Betsy to become my assistant.
That's terribly kind of you, and very flattering.
Well, you can just forget it.
Now, let's have no foolish pride.
- I said let's forget it.
- Just a minute, Ned.
If you don't mind, I'd like a chance to express myself.
Another thing, old man, I can probably use my influence to get you some instructor's job.
Don't bother to do me any favors.
Ned I didn't say I was going to take the position. All I said was...
Betsy, no wife of mine is going to work, not as long as I have a spark of life left in my body.
That is an absurdly old-fashioned attitude.
Well that's what I like about Nuzzie.
I just adore old-fashioned men.
Could I have an onion instead of an olive this time?
You'll find some in the icebox.
- Excuse me.
- Oh.
You're so much better for him than I am.
If I'd married him,
I would have just spoiled him rotten.
You shouldn't take it this way, Brainard.
There's nothing to be ashamed of.
After all, what are friends for?
Look, just where do you get the idea that we're supposed to be starving to death around here?
Okay, so the Flubber deal has stalled in Washington temporarily, but I've got something going on in that garage out there...
Well, it can make a man wealthy a dozen times over.
Hold tight, Humph.
Here we go.
Biff! Biff!
Biff, help me!
Hang on, Humph.
Just a little trouble with the valve.
Please, Biff.
Get me outta here, Biff!
Biff! Come on.
Get me outta here!
I don't wish to pry, but may I inquire what this marvelous new discovery is?
It's a revolutionary concept in weather control.
Weather control.
That's right. It'll effect people all over the world.
And its commercial possibilities are endless.
May I ask how it works?
Or is it still in the visionary stage?
It is not in the visionary stage.
I bombard the clouds with a technique
I am not at the moment at liberty to divulge.
Oh, I see.
Biff!
Biff!
Biff!
You bombard the clouds with people.
That is original thinking.
Biff!
Who's there?
Humphrey, are you all right?
Well, I don't know.
Who's there? Answer or I'll blast you to ribbons.
It's all right, Mr. Hummel.
Nobody in here but us chickens.
Oh!
Dinner's ready when you are.
- Hi, Prof. How's it goin'?
- Fine. Fine.
You know, I found out one thing yesterday.
Flubber gas has a certain antagonizing effect on the atmosphere.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
And today I'm really going to stir it up.
I'm looking for big game today.
Like that big, fat cloud out there.
Come on, Humph.
Let's get suited up.
You're not gonna shoot me out the garage again?
Will you stop worrying so much?
Well, why couldn't you test the suit with a chimpanzee?
Are you kidding?
Those animals cost money.
Now, let's see.
I'd say distance about three miles.
Might be a little far, but we'll take a crack at it anyway, hey, Charlie?
Maybe give 'em a little rain over in
Lincoln County. They need it there too.
All right.
Switch on.
Relax, Charlie.
You won't take the rap this time.
All right, here we go.
Ready. Aim.
Fire.
♪ It isn't raining rain you know
♪ It's raining Flubber gas ♪
Hmm. Smells like rain.
Better get my umbrella.
Nothing.
All right.
We'll pour on a little more juice.
Now...
Come on now, cloud.
Cry a little.
Maybe we're going to have a change in the weather, dear.
Yes. The barometer's real...
Nothing, Charlie. Just nothing.
What have we got to lose?
Why don't we turn up full power and see what happens?
Yeah. What have we got to lose?
- Well, you can't blame Betsy.
- Thank you, sir.
How would you feel having to live in the same house with that nut?
Oh, no! No!
Well, we didn't get much rain out of that one, did we, Charlie?
Well, here comes another one.
Oh, yes, such a lovely piece,
Mrs. Brainard.
I just don't see how you can bring yourself to sell it.
Well, a little extra money around the house comes in handy.
A professor's wife, you understand.
Yes, well, under the circumstances,
I think I can accommodate you.
Let's see.
There's 40, 60...
Broken windows?
No, I haven't seen anything like that around here.
Just stay on the ball out there.
Sure, Captain. Sure.
Hanson, Kelly! Somebody answer me!
Hanson! I hear water!
It's all right, Captain.
We're just gettin' the car washed.
No, no, no! We don't pay off on that!
Nobody, but nobody, puts anything over on Alonzo P. Hawk.
Quiet back there. I'm on the phone.
Read the small print!
Hold on.
Now look. If the glass broke, you were probably negligent.
The Auld Lang Syne does not pay off on negligence, friend.
And that goes for all of ya!
Well, nothing.
Absolutely nothing.
You can come out now, Charlie.
Well, Charlie, maybe I was wrong.
Maybe there was nothing to the idea after all.
It won't be the first time we've struck out, will it?
- Hey, where do we put this stuff?
- Our test site's over here.
You know, I sure appreciate you guys helping us out.
What are we doing here?
What's the big secret?
You'll find out soon enough.
Or maybe the cloud was just too far away, Charlie.
Rainmakers have always run into that same old snag.
Clouds are either too far away or no clouds at all.
If we could just have clouds when and where we needed them, maybe...
Wait a minute, Charlie.
I made that little teakettle cloud rain by bombarding it with a Flubber gas beam, and disorganizing the moisture pattern.
Would it be possible to make a cloud by working in reverse?
Naturally, it couldn't be anything as simple as just reversing the polarity of the gas.
Or could it?
Could it, Charlie?
Let's find out.
Now we'll reverse the polarity and see what happens.
Oh, something's happening, all right, Charlie.
Something's really happening.
And the N-402s don't even seem to care.
Now, let's see.
I reversed the polarity.
Now, this must have integrated the vaporific forces and promoted the coalescence of the interatomic junctures.
Nuzzie?
Is that you, darling?
Desiree here. Hello? Nuzzie?
Hello, Desiree.
Poor lamb.
You sound as if you have a terrible cold.
Isn't that nice little wife of yours taking proper care of you?
You know, overshoes and all that sort of thing.
- What do you want, Desiree?
- Well, lover, I just wanted to be sure you hadn't forgotten our little get-together tomorrow.
- Get...
- Get-together?
Well, of course, dearest. We arranged it when I saw you yesterday.
Oh, yes. Yesterday.
Well, très bon, chéri.
And I'll see you around eightish?
Hugs and kisses.
Arrivederci.
Well, that puts the tin hat on it!
DP, P, plus, minus and G.
GT, DH.
Great jumping Jupiter Pluvius!
We've made our own cloud!
And it's raining! It's raining!
It's raining! Charlie, it's raining!
And it's our rain, Charlie, made from our own cloud!
Taste it. Isn't it wonderful?
Oh, my notes.
I don't want to lose them.
Now I know how those Texas oil fellas feel when a gusher comes in.
Isn't it wonderful, Charlie?
Where's my pen?
It's really comin' down.
Hey, come on, Biff. What gives?
You know, this isn't the first time we've been roped in on some half-baked idea of yours.
You know, it wasn't my idea entirely.
The professor's in on this too.
- The prof is?
- Just as good as.
He checked the whole thing out with me.
Why didn't you say so? That's different.
'Cause if the prof says it's okay...
♪ Raining you know it's raining ♪
Betsy!
Betsy!
Betsy! Betsy, I made a cloud, and I made it rain.
It's bad luck to open an umbrella in the house.
"How," you say, "did you make this cloud, you genius you?"
And I say, "Just the way nature herself does it,
"out of the moisture in the air around us."
Of course, it's been going on right under our noses for thousands of years, but the question was, how does she do it? Well...
Speaking of things going on under our noses, have you been seeing
Desiree De la Roche?
I may have bumped into her a couple of times.
She phoned a while ago, mentioned something about a little get-together tomorrow night.
- Said that you'd know all about it.
- Said I'd know all about it?
Why, I haven't the... Wait a minute.
There was some talk about a party.
- I think it was for Halloween.
- Ha!
I was on my way home from class, and she just happened to be driving by...
Women like Desiree never happen to do anything.
What?
If I wasn't such a sweet, innocent-minded little wife,
I'd say that woman was trying to get her hooks into you again.
Now, Betsy, that isn't worthy of you.
Mary Lee... I mean, Desiree, just isn't that kind of a girl.
Do me a personal favor and stop calling that woman a girl!
Well, anyway, underneath all that glamour and gaiety and intelligence is really a simple, kind-hearted person.
You bet.
Betsy, I hate to say this, but I've noticed a change in you lately.
It all seemed to start the night that sneak Shelby Ashton came over and here offered you that job.
I told you I didn't want that job, but I'm beginning to change my mind.
Betsy, I'm not a fussy man, but when that Ashton comes over here and starts buttering you up with that guff about "beauty plus brains".
Oh!
And as far as you're concerned, there's not a word of truth in it, right?
I didn't say that, but anybody that would listen to what that pretentious pipsqueak has to say...
Oh, Ned, let's not quarrel.
- Betsy, are you going somewhere?
- Yes, I am, Ned.
You see, I have a problem.
I love you.
If it weren't for that,
I'd know exactly what to do.
Betsy, you're not leaving!
Yes, I'm going somewhere where I can think clearly.
- Think clearly? About what?
- About you and Desiree.
Desiree doesn't mean anything to me,
Betsy. I don't mean anything to her.
Oh, really? Well, you should've heard her on the phone when she thought she was talking to you.
Everything was "darling," "sweetie,"
"lover," "chéri, " "hugs and kisses"!
But, Betsy, that's just her way.
She's a very outgoing personality.
Well, say good-bye to another outgoing personality.
Betsy, you're not leaving this house!
Ned, I'm going to the Daggetts' for a few days.
Betsy.
I don't know when and if I'll be back.
I just have to think calmly and logically.
Betsy, you can't go anyplace.
What did you do to our car?
I didn't do anything to it.
And don't change the subject.
I'm going to the Daggetts'.
Please, Betsy, can't we reason this out?
No, because a strange thing has happened to me.
Desiree De la Roche may or may not be the sweetest girl in the world, but I'll tell you one thing, every time I hear her name I get awfully, awfully, awfully, awfully angry.
But, Betsy, you're not being very logical about this.
Hey, what I don't get is, how come no pads behind Humphrey?
Humph doesn't need 'em.
He'll come smashing into you, you guys'll go bouncing back, and ol' Humph is gonna keep right on goin', right, Humph?
- I guess so.
- Okay, Humph, it's your neck.
Ready, you guys?
Ready, humph? One, two, hike!
Oof!
Who's in there?
Answer or I'll blast ya!
That's it. I've had it. I quit.
Look, after all you've been through, you're not gonna turn chicken.
I already did.
You'd better answer it, Mrs. Daggett.
That poor man has phoned a half-dozen times today. I'm tired of stalling him.
What's the matter? Afraid to talk to him?
Why doesn't somebody pick up that phone? Or is it contaminated?
And would you come in and help me with my hair, if you don't mind?
Ja?
Is this the, uh, Daggett residence?
- Ja.
- Well, who's this?
This Hulda Christoffsen.
I think. New maid, by golly.
Oh. Well, Hulda, may I speak to Mrs. Brainard, please?
It's very important.
Miss Betsy not here.
She been sittin' around all day cryin' like heart would break.
She been gone out tonight.
Gone out? Do you know where?
She invited many parties.
Very popular, I think.
Look very pretty, by Jiminy.
- Look beautiful.
- Oh?
You been gone out tonight, too?
You have lady friend too, Ja?
No, I been sit home alone.
Friendless, hungry.
There's nothing to eat in the house.
- Good!
- What?
I think I hang up now.
"Gone out."
"Look beautiful."
As far as she's concerned,
I could starve to death.
There must be something to eat in this house.
Soap.
Dandy. For dogs.
Wheat flour, whole milk, soybean meal, dried fish.
Hmm!
Sorry, Charlie.
Mmm. Candy.
Not good for little dogs, Charlie.
Trick or treat, Professor!
Oh, I'm sorry fellas.
There's just not a thing in the house.
Trick or treat.
Except these chocolates.
They look stale.
Yes, they do look a little stale, don't they?
- I'll tell you, if you don't want them...
- Yes, we do.
Hey, that's some crazy radiator cap the professor's got there.
Yeah. Guess he's goin' out to make some field studies with it.
As a matter of fact, I thought I might go out tonight after dinner.
Hi, Prof. By the way, have you fellas eaten?
No!
Well, science marches on, but not on an empty stomach, huh?
Why don't we go out and have a nice, hot dinner?
- Great! I'm starving.
- Yeah!
Does anybody have any money?
Oh, I'm sorry, Prof, but the hot water bottles didn't work, and we had to blow every cent we had on the scuba suit.
God, I wish we were invited to one of those Halloween parties around here.
I bet they got lots of eats.
Wait a minute! I was invited to a Halloween party at Desiree's house.
Now, let's see. Help me get that old trunk off of the shelf, huh?
But how 'bout Humph and me?
Don't you worry.
We're all going to get something to eat.
Open that side.
Now I'll go in first, and then you fellas come along later and ring the doorbell.
We'll arrange some kind of a signal.
And then... Here's my old coonskin coat.
My old hat.
Just a little something in case I get hungry later.
Yes, sir.
Two longs and a short. That's it.
Oh, pardon me. I'll get it.
- Boo!
- Well, a couple of ghosts!
Trick or treat!
Well, we don't want any tricks around here, do we?
- Here's some nice popcorn.
- Oh, boy! Popcorn!
- Potato chips.
- I like potato chips!
- And some chicken.
- Chicken! I want a drumstick.
Well, Brainard. Aren't you going to ask the little folk to step inside?
- Come on, kiddies.
- Jiggers!
Well! How do you like those big lugs pretending they're children?
I'll go and have a talk with them.
Nuzzie! So nice that you could get here.
There's a tub of martinis in here, and everybody's bobbing for olives.
It's just terrific that you brought your saxophone.
Oh, well...
Boys, I'd like you to meet the finest saxophone player in the history of Medfield High School.
- Well, I wouldn't say that.
- You were, too! Now go on, Nuzzie. Play.
Well, I don't think I'd better.
Come on, lover, join right in.
It'll be just like old times.
Well, if you fellas don't mind.
The same sweet clown. I'm so glad to see that girl hasn't changed you.
I don't know whether
I should have come.
Nonsense, my dear.
A bit of gaiety will do you good.
- Good evening.
- Good evening, sir.
- Good evening, madam.
- I feel guilty about Ned.
He's so helpless all by himself.
Excuse me, my dear.
Hello, Frederick.
- May I take your coat, madam?
- Oh, yes. Thank you.
- Betsy! So nice to see you.
- Excuse me, please!
How lovely you are when you're angry.
Is anything the matter?
Betsy! What in the world are you doing here?
I might ask the same thing of you.
In fact, I think I will.
Here I was feeling sorry for you because I thought you were home alone and hungry.
Well, I was. But there is an instinct called self-preservation, you know.
Under certain conditions even the lowest form of animal life will go searching for food.
Very aptly put.
Look, Neptune, why don't you just submerge?
Ned, there is no reason for any of that. I'm leaving!
Betsy, I want to talk to you.
There is nothing for you and me to say to one another!
Shelby, would you take me home, please?
You see, Brainard, you've already spoiled the party for her.
- Now why don't you leave Betsy alone?
- Ashton, if you don't stay out of this...
I will not have you two fighting over me!
Why, Betsy!
What a perfectly darling costume!
Some kind of a peasant, aren't you?
Good night, Nuzzie.
- Wait, Betsy...
- Come on, Nuzzie. Back to the party.
- Wait, Mary Lee...
- Come on, darlin'.
Normally, I'm the last person in the world to intrude upon a person's private life, but when you love someone, as I do...
Thank you for bringing me home, Shelby.
Simply because of a headstrong, impetuous marriage to a man not fit to touch the hem of your skirt.
Betsy, I forgive you for what you did to me, but...
Oh, Shelby. I didn't want to hurt you.
No, it's all right.
As the poet says,
"The hurt is not so deep as a well,
"nor so wide as a church door,
"but 'tis enough, 'twill serve."
I'm sorry, Shelby. Good night.
I'll ring you first thing in the morning!
Okay, Charlie.
Battle stations.
I need a guinea pig for this experiment, and I know just the pig.
Brainard!
Ahhh!
Oh, say, Captain, we want to thank you again for this new prowl car.
Don't worry, Captain. This is one car we're really gonna take care of.
Aww.
- What is it?
- I've got just the faintest ghost of an idea.
I'm terribly sorry, Professor, but did our brand-new patrol car get in your way?
Officer!
It isn't my fault!
It's that fiend, Brainard!
He's up there, somewhere!
Get him! Find him!
Do something!

Good morning, boys.
You're up early this morning.
Bright and early, Professor.
Mr. Hawk!
What are you doing here?
Spreading sunshine, bringing cheer and good tidings to my fellow man.
Uh, may I take the liberty, Professor?
Now, as you can see, this is a map of our fair community.
What about it?
On Thursday p.m. this week, a peculiar thing happened in Medfield.
Plate glass in stores, automobile windshields, bottles, clock faces, glass of every kind and description began to break and shatter in various portions of our community.
This in turn brought mental anguish and sorrow to the owners, more especially to the Auld Lang Syne
Insurance Company, which was left holding the bag for all the damages.
But what has all this got to do with me?
As president of Auld Lang Syne, I was naturally interested in this phenomenon, so I made up a kind of a war map of the damaged areas.
As you see, they formed a pattern, a sort of cone-shaped pattern of devastation, as though some unseen force had fanned out from one beginning point, at a place on the corner of Maple and Litchfield.
Now, I may be wrong, Professor, but isn't that the precise point on which
I'm standing at this very moment?
That's right. I heard something about the breaking glass, but I had no idea
I could have been responsible.
Professor, I have suffered damages amounting to tens of thousands of dollars because of you.
I could have you dragged off to jail and left there.
But outside of making me feel good all over, what would it get me?
No, the point is, I'm not sore at you at all, Professor.
As a matter of fact, I take my hat off to you.
Yes, sir, I think you've really got something here in this glass-breaking gizmo.
Why, it's pure genius.
While everybody else is busy making things, you come up with the answer.
You come up with something that breaks things!
But that wasn't the idea.
Okay, Brainard.
You've done your part of it.
Now, as your partner, here's how we go about it.
Very quietly, we buy up a lot of glass company stock, slowly, so that nobody catches on.
Then suddenly, all over the country, all over the world, zingo!
Glass begins to break.
We replace it with new glass.
It breaks. We'll clean up!
Mr. Hawk, you don't seem to understand. I...
How about that United Nations building in New York?
How about all that glass, huh?
And stained glass.
Maybe we could organize a quiet little corporation that does nothing but break church glass.
Well, what's the matter, Brainard?
You don't think you're gonna freeze me out of this thing like you did out of Flubber, do you?
Your friend, Mr. Hawk, isn't gonna be standing with a balloon in his hand watching the parade go by this time.
Mr. Hawk, you don't for one minute think
I'd go along with a scheme like that, do you?
Well, what are you acting so high and mighty about?
You invented this glass-breaker, didn't you?
The glass-breaking was an unfortunate side effect of my cloud experiment.
In trying to reach the cloud with my weather gun there must have been an overload of electronic excitation, which set up an inharmonic sawtooth oscillation and imparted a tremor to the gas.
Now, this was intercepted by the glass, which is, of course, an amorphous super-fluid in a temporary state of rigidity.
And I guess the resulting strain was just a little too much.
Yeah. Look, Professor, why don't you just settle for what you got here?
With the money from this thing we'll both get fat.
And there'll be enough left over for you to take care of the Medfield problem.
Well, that's what you want to do, isn't it?
Save Medfield College?
That kind of money would never help
Medfield College or anyone else, Mr. Hawk.
Well, you know what you're doing, don't you?
You'll go to jail for what you did to me!
And before this day is over
I'll be back here with the sheriff.
And we'll have this place tied up tighter than Fort Knox!
With all your work and all your experiments!
Good day, Mr. Hawk.
And as for Medfield, a year from now, people will have forgotten there ever was such a punk little college.
You wanna bet?
- Oh. Hi, Pop, what are you doing here?
- Out of the way, son.
Hey, Pop, I thought I'd mention it.
You're a little overdue on my allowance.
Allowance!
Why, I'm just liable to send you off to jail with this criminal here, as a fellow conspirator, a partner in crime!
Why, if you weren't deductible,
I'd disown you!
- What was that all about?
- Come on, fellas.
Let's get to work on that football suit of yours.
Professor, you mean you're gonna help us?
Maybe the college won't be here next year, but we're going to see that nobody ever forgets it.
Yahoo! Come on, Humph!
Let's hustle into it!
But, Biff, about my idea!
You promised!
Will you forget about that?
The Professor's with us now!
The first team's coming into the game!
We're gonna have the suit in no time.
Biff, Biff.
Let's take it easy for a minute.
Now, your basic idea is fine.
I just think there might be a more effective way of using it.
That's what I've been trying to tell him.
Forget the suit.
Put the Flubber gas in the football!
Boy, just think, 70-yard kicks,
90-yard passes!
Humph, what is the matter with you?
Are you cracking up?
Our team can't even hold onto the ball now.
Now, what would happen if we hopped it up with Flubber gas?
Biff is right.
It's very important to control the ball at all times.
We must never lose possession of it.
So, we never throw just the ball, we throw the player with the ball.
- Right! We throw a player?
- That's right.
Look, Professor, couldn't we put the gas in the football?
- You know, forget the suit?
- Humphrey, it's just simple logic.
With the Flubber gas we make you quasi-weightless, or buoyant, and then we throw you with the ball.
- You do?
- Yes! Don't you see the beauty of it?
Even if they intercept, we still have possession of the ball. Right?
- Right!
- Right, Humphrey?
- Uh, right.
- Well, good. Let's go to work!
Poor old Medfield!
See them run!
Come on, Rutland! Mow them down!
Well, ladies and gentlemen, here we are in the little community of Medfield.
Say what you will about their football team, at least the weather here is good.
A clear, crisp, moonlight night, not a cloud in the sky.
As for what has been optimistically advertised as a football game,
I'm afraid we can't promise you much.
Mighty Rutland University, untied, unscored upon for the past three seasons, knocking at the door of the national championship pitted tonight against puny Medfield.
Oh! Here comes Rutland on the field.
They've chickened out, both of them.
- Wait'll I get my hands on those two!
- Coach! Coach!
- I got a note for you.
- Oh, good, good.
"Dear coach, Humphrey and I will be a little late for the game tonight,
"so go ahead without us.
"We're getting a secret weapon ready.
"You'll be proud of us when you see what it is.
"Best wishes, Biff Hawk."
- Oh, no. Coach. Steady. Steady.
- Best wishes? Best wishes! Oh!
And at fullback position for
Rutland, Hjalmar Woccskyinska, a 240-pound husky from Broken Jaw, Idaho.
Back home during his summer vacations,
Hjalmar runs a training school for prison guards.
And that completes the starting lineup for Rutland.
How would you like to be in little Medfield's shoes, and square off against that array of giants, huh, friends?
Oh, here comes Medfield.
Well, here come the lambs to the slaughter.
Jeffrey, I just don't see why you had to come.
You know how this game is going to upset you.
My dear, when a ship is sinking, the captain remains at his post.
Come on, Medfield!
Eat 'em alive!
Second quarter,
Rutland's ball, first and ten.
Ready, set.
Hut one! Hut two!
Hut three! Hut four!
Down to the 30, the 20, the 10, and
over for another
Rutland touchdown.
Yeah, there goes another one.
I can't understand what's happened to Biff.
He went to get that vulcanizing kit over an hour ago.
Sir, we're never gonna get this thing ready in time.
- If you'd just reconsider my idea.
- What's that, Humphrey?
- Well, this. There's Flubber gas in here.
- What's it for?
Well, so I don't have to wear this suit.
Instead, we give the good ole football a shot of gas, and then zzshhhh!
- Humphrey. Humphrey...
- Boy, just think. 70-yard passes...
- Humphrey.
- 80-yard punts!
- 90-yard field goals!
- Wait a minute now.
We've been through all that.
Don't you understand, Humphrey?
You don't have a thing to worry about now.
With this new valve you have perfect buoyancy control at all times.
Professor! Come on.
We gotta get out of here.
- What's wrong, Biff?
- My father.
I was just over at Higgins' Super Mercantile store getting this vulcanizing kit.
Pop walked in to get the sheriff who was his dinner there, and I overheard them talking.
Then they went over to Judge Murdock's.
And professor, they've got a warrant for you, and they're coming over here to throw you in jail.
Well, you're right.
We'd better get out of here.
We'll have to fix the suit in the locker room.
Open the doors, Biff.
Look out!
Back out, you idiot!
He's getting away!
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm afraid it's going just the way we predicted.
Mighty Rutland is shredding the little Medfield team to bits.
As we go into the closing minutes of the third quarter, the score, Rutland 28,
Medfield, nothing.
Well, he must be here someplace.
You two get the rest of the boys and spread out!
"Aye, tear her tattered ensign down, long has it waved on high."
Look, I don't mind losing the football game, Professor Ashton, but spare us your garbled quotations.
As you will. You're not expecting anyone, are you, Betsy?
- Thank you.
- Shelby, wouldn't you rather sit on your own side of the field? You're winning.
Oh, it's of no consequence, my dear.
Just remember, the next time you see a football game, you'll see it from the right side, the Rutland side.
Pitney returns to take off to the 21-yard line.
Time out for Medfield.
- It's a massacre, coach.
- Yeah, ain't it a shame.
We should have brought along the girls' volleyball team.
We could have sent them in.
Okay.
Any volunteers?
Hold it, coach! We're here.
Everything's okay, sir.
The secret weapon is primed and ready to fire.
Where've you been, Hawk?
And what's all this static about a secret weapon?
This is it, sir.
- You're the secret weapon?
- Yes, sir.
It's not fair.
- It's not fair.
- Come on, boy.
Let's mop up the field with 'em.
Hawk and Humphrey coming in for Medfield.
Medfield's ball, first and ten on their 21-yard line.
Humph, give it the gas.
Ready?
Break!
Down! Hut!
Hut two! Hike!
Way to go, Humphrey!
Touchdown! Come on!
All right, you first string, get back in there! And forget your manners!
And there goes the try for the extra point.
It's good.
The score, Rutland 37,
Medfield 7.
I tell you, that Medfield touchdown was certainly a surprise.
To recap, Humphrey, the Medfield tailback, received the ball, then he, uh...
George, what kind of play would you say that was?
Uh...
Rutland returns the kickoff to Medfield's 45-yard line.
Now we'll see what happens.
For my money, folks, I think little
Medfield's gonna be awfully sorry they made that accidental touchdown.
Those Rutland boys are like a bunch of hungry tigers.
Ready, set!
Hut one! Hut two!
Hut three! Hut four!
What happened to you on that play, stupid?
What happened to me?
What happened to you, clod?
Well, now. Let's see what happened that time.
As I make it out,
Rutland had just started one of its famous razzle-dazzle plays, when, uh...
Did you see how that happened there, George?
Uh, well, it...
Olson returns the ball to Rutland's 38-yard line.
Hut one! Hut two!
- Here he comes!
- Catch him!
Humphrey knocked out of bounds over
the Medfield 49-yard line.
- Upsy-daisy!
- Have a good trip, Humph!
Out! Get him away from me!
Medfield ball, first and ten.
Down! Hut one!
Oof!
I don't know what it is, but there's somethin' crooked
- going on here.
- Okay. Here's a rule book.
You think there's somethin' wrong?
You find it!
Well, ladies and gentlemen,
I guess you know by now, we are witnessing one of the wildest, slam-bang football games ever played anywhere at any time.
Tiny Medfield College, led by captain Biff Hawk, and a high-stepping back named Humphrey, has turned a rout into a battle of titans.
And, oh!
There's the kickoff!
It arches through the air down to the Rutland 25...
Rutland fumbles!
Medfield's got the ball again.
Looks like mighty Rutland's beginning to feel the pressure.
Medfield's ball, first and ten.
Hut one! Hut two! Hike!
The ball is snapped to Humphrey.
He fakes a hand off to the wing back.
Humphrey still has the ball.
Now Hawk has Humphrey.
Rule seven, section 30...
Get off the playin' field.
I got myself a football game goin' on out here!
- Why, you...
- Wait a minute, coach.
Take it easy, huh?
Well, it's a race against time now.
Medfield trails Rutland by nine points.
With less than four minutes left to play, the big question is can Rutland stop
Medfield's brilliant aerial attack?
Oh, it looks as if Rutland may have something up their sleeve.
Medfield ball, first and ten.
I've never seen 'em use this kind of defense before.
Down! Hut one!
Hut two! Hike!
Now!
Wait a minute! Are you gonna let them get away with that?
What are you kickin' about?
That's a legal tackle, ain't it?
Now, remember, you guys, the old lady with a twist on two.
Ready? Break!
- The same thing again.
- Down!
Hut one! Hike!
No! No!
The other way!
Looks like the old Statue of Liberty play.
Right, George?
Medfield scores.
The clock is ticking away the last minutes of the game.
Medfield takes over the ball again.
Ready? Break!
You look kinda flabby, Humph.
Better gas up a little.
Down! Hut one!
Hut two! Hike!
Biff!
Biff!
Biff! Biff!
It's Hawk with Humphrey.
He's down to the 20, the 15, the ten, the five...
He's back to the ten, the 15, the 20...
Biff!
Medfield calls time out.
And that looks like the end of the line for Medfield.
They're back on their own two yard line with eight seconds left to play.
The score, Rutland 37, Medfield 35.
Well, Humph, I guess we've had it.
Anyway, we tried.
Well, if you'd just let me use my needle, we'd have won easy.
Well, it isn't doing us any good back at the lab.
Well, like I said,
I never did trust this crummy suit.
Humph!
There may be time for one more play.
Medfield lining up for a field goal attempt.
They're gonna try a field goal from here?
It looks as though Medfield is going to attempt a 98-yard field goal.
Repeat, 98 yards. Ridiculous.
The poor lads must be cracking under the strain.
Hike!
Too bad. Medfield just made a final, desperate effort to...
Wait a minute.
It's gaining altitude.
And there goes the final gun as the game ends and Medfield wins.
The ball, the ball is still going up...
Up... Up...
Out of the stadium!
Ladies and gentlemen,
I think it's going into orbit.
George.
George, did ya see that?
We won! We... Ooh! Ooh!
Get him! Get him!
Get him! Get him!
Oh, shut up!
Well, the trial of Professor Ned Brainard swung into its third day today.
Against advice to the contrary,
Professor Brainard continued to act as counsel in his own behalf.
He was quoted as saying he was confident in the due processes of law.
Despite the growing tide of testimony against him,
as the prosecution kept a steady parade of witnesses
moving through the witness box,
today, the prosecution unlimbered its big guns against the defense.
Professor Brainard, you seem proud of your job as a teacher.
Do you like it because you believe it makes you important?
Well, not me personally.
But I believe the work I do is important.
In what way? Would you care to tell us a little about it?
It gives me the opportunity to help young people, to stir them up, to make them restless, to make them think.
Maybe plant a bug of discovery in their minds, or...
- And you think that's important?
- Of course it's important!
One of those young people might discover something the entire world has been looking for.
He might not, but I like to feel that
I had a part in giving him a crack at it.
I see.
Now, regardless of whether you are found guilty or not,
I ask you to consider this question very carefully.
Would you hope to return to your classroom?
Would you continue as before?
Would you recklessly incite the young minds of your class again?
To inspire them to such experiments as that which bombarded our skies with powerful rays?
Rays which expose all of us to unknown peril?
I put the question to you again, Professor, and I ask you to mark well your answer.
Would you still persist in these dangerous and malicious follies?
Well, that question is a little difficult to answer.
Well, Professor?
- Mr. Prosecutor, may I say something?
- Go ahead, Professor.
I'm sure we'd all be interested in hearing your views.
- Looks like he's gonna craw fish.
- Well, it seems to me that a lot of people are going around these days selling fear.
All kinds of fear.
Fear of bombs, bugs, smog, surpluses, fallout, falling hair, even fear of Mr. Hawk.
We find our self apologizing, hiding our heads, or jumping at shadows.
I can remember when Groundhog Day only came once a year in this country.
Now, I see a lot of students from my science class here in the courtroom.
They may not be the most studious group of young people in college today, but I'll say this for them, so far they are unafraid.
They have good will, enthusiasm, and an infinite capacity for making mistakes.
I have high hopes for them.
Am I to understand, Professor, you actually encourage mistakes in your class?
Mr. Prosecutor, the road to genius is paved with fumble-footing and bumbling.
Anyone who falls flat on his face is at least moving in the right direction, forward.
And the fellow who makes the most mistakes may be the one who will save the neck of the whole world someday.
Now, may I ask again, and will you answer clearly, for the benefit of the court and the jury, most of whom are parents.
Suppose you are returned to your role as a teacher, would you do exactly as you did before?
Yes. I would do exactly as I did before.
Order! Order, please.
Order!
Another such outburst and the bailiff will clear the court.
That is all.
You may step down.
Come on. Let's tie this thing up and get out of here.
- Are you sure?
- Stall for time.
15 or 20 minutes should do it.
Professor, you may call your first witness.
- No witnesses, Your Honor.
- In that case, I will sum up briefly.
Sit down.
Is it true, Professor, that you have provided no witnesses in your behalf?
- No, I haven't, Your Honor.
- May I suggest, Professor, as defense counsel, you're not doing much in your own behalf.
I'm a witness for the defense,
Your Honor.
Splendid.
- I object!
- I object too!
Both objections overruled.
But, Your Honor, this is most unusual procedure.
It is also unusual procedure for the defense to have no witnesses in his own behalf.
Swear in the witness, please.
I merely hoped to save the court's valuable time.
My time is your time,
Mr. Prosecutor.
Do you solemnly swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth?
- I do.
- State your name.
Elizabeth Brainard.
- Will the defense question the witness?
- No, Your Honor.
Very well. Will you kindly tell your story in your own words?
Well, uh...
As I was saying, my name is Elizabeth Brainard.
Occupation, housewife.
I first met the defendant at Medfield College where I was employed as a secretary.
He scratched my fender in the parking lot just outside the administration building.
And I fell hopelessly in love.
Your Honor, I don't see what the testimony of this witness can...
On October 30th of this year,
I became involved in an argument with the defendant.
I told him I didn't think I was cut out to be a scientist's wife.
Well, I'd like to inform the defendant at this time that I was wrong.
Whether he happens to be a scientist or an Arctic explorer...
Or a headhunter, or anything else,
I'm cut out to be only one thing, his wife.
I love him.
- Betsy, do you mean that?
- Of course, she means it.
The witness is under oath to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.
- Oh, Betsy.
- Your Honor, I would like to inquire, is this a court of law or a lonely hearts club?
The witness has been instructed to tell her own story in her own way.
Please sit down.
Your Honor, will you excuse the witness at this time?
Uh, will Your Honor also tell the defense counsel to please sit down?
The defense counsel is so instructed.
Why are we looking up at that clock all the time?
How should I know?
Sit down.
Well, then I went to Finney's to buy this darling midnight blue dress that was on sale.
The defendant always said he loved me in midnight blue.
Your Honor, what does all this foofaraw about a blue dress have to do with the case?
Uh, Mrs. Brainard, does all this, uh, foofaraw have any bearing on the disposition of the case?
- You bet, Your Honor.
- I don't believe it.
The prosecution will have an opportunity to cross-examine.
That is, if you don't mind wasting the time.
Gangway! Hey, gangway.
Gangway, everybody! Gangway!
- Ooh!
- Gangway!
- Excuse me, please.
- Uh, but, Mrs. Brainard, please...
Professor Brainard...
I don't wish to pry, but would you kindly divulge your intentions?
The court is waiting.
I'm sorry, Your Honor. May I ask that this witness be recalled to testify for me?
- Very well.
- Objection!
Your Honor, the case is ready for summation.
Must we subject ourselves to irrelevant testimony trumped up by the defense?
The witness is qualified.
If I recall, he testified in behalf of the prosecution two days ago.
But Your Honor...
Do you wish to challenge the integrity of your own witness?
Down, down!
- Now, sir, we know who you are.
- Oh, yes. I'm A.J. Allen.
I'm the county agricultural agent, that's who I am.
Now, Mr. Allen, day before yesterday, you testified that the rays with which I bombarded the atmosphere seemed to have a peculiar effect on the flowers, crops, and vegetation and so forth around here.
- Is that right?
- Oh, yes, yes. I said that. I certainly did.
And you were very upset.
Oh, I was extremely upset, yes.
So much so that you decided to investigate the matter thoroughly.
Oh, certainly.
I'm dedicated to my work, you know.
And you've come here today to make a complete report on your findings.
Well, I didn't come here to toast marshmallows, you know.
No. Now, Mr. Allen...
First, would you mind telling us about the soil conditions here in Medfield County?
Well, it's no secret, goodness knows.
Medfield County has the thinnest, rockiest, wore-out, farmed-out, pooped-out soil in the whole state.
It's pitiful!
I've been so ashamed.
It's not much good for growing things.
Growing things?
Professor, you want me to show you something?
Wait, I'll show you something.
Wait a minute.
Do you know what that poor thing is?
That is an ear of corn.
That's what we've been growing around here.
Do you mind watching that, Your Honor?
Growing things!
My goodness!
That's a radish.
A radish!
You wouldn't get a respectable burp out of a dozen of 'em.
If you want to see something really miserable...
I have a rutabaga here someplace...
I know I had it when I left home.
Somebody put...
The rutabaga. Where's the rutabaga?
It's around here somewhere...
Uh, that's fine,
Mr. Allen. Thank you.
Now, would you tell us, have you noticed any change recently?
Have I noticed any change?
Why, Professor, you don't know what's going on!
All over Medfield County, things are growing up like crazy!
Why, everywhere I look, everything is suddenly all fertiled up!
Mr. Allen, would you say it might have something to do with what the prosecutor has been calling
"Flubber Fallout"?
Oh, I don't...
He can call it anything he wants.
Personally, Professor,
I think that you've invented...
Oh, for heaven's sakes.
You might call it "dry rain."
- Dry what?
- Dry rain.
I just thought of it just this minute.
That's exactly what it is.
I don't believe I've ever heard of dry rain.
Is it anything like taking a dry bath, or going for a dry canoe ride?
No, no.
Actually, it's more like guzzling a dry martini, you know.
It's very stimulating.
You see, Professor Brainard's rays must have combined with massive amounts of nitrogen out in the atmosphere, see?
And it came "shoomping" right down in front of our eyes, but we never saw it.
Why, for all we know, it might be dry-raining right down in this courtroom this very minute, fertilizing everything in sight!
You can't tell, you know.
Do you expect this court to believe all this mumbo jumbo?
Can you substantiate it?
Oh, my goodness!
I thought he'd never ask me!
Boys, bring in the substantiation,
- will you, please?
- Yes, sir!
Come on! Bring it in!
That's right, boys!
Just put it up there on the bench!
Look at those carrots, judge!
I tell you, a rabbit couldn't...
- Boys! Boys!
- Order!
Don't push! Keep it dignified!
Well, don't just sit there.
Do something!
Your wife says to get home right away.
A summer squash just rolled off the vine next door and smashed your sports car!
The jurors will please sit down! Order!
Thank you very, very, very much, judge.
You should try some of this walnut.
It's off my own tree, you know.
- That's a walnut?
- Oh, yes, yes.
Your honor, this is outrageous!
I leave it to you...
Smart move.
Case dismissed.
That isn't what I meant!
Come on, pop.
Don't take it so hard.
I'm not crying, you blasted nitwit!
It's these onions!
Of course, I don't have anything against science, mind you.
As a matter of fact,
I'm crazy about it, but...
Betsy.
Offhand, can you name one thing that science hasn't improved upon, one way or another?
- Offhand, I think I can.
- All right, what?
Oh!
I guess I'll have to go along with that.
(BOTH IMITATING
CAR ENGINE)
Hang on, we're coming to a bend.
You're going too fast!
No, I'm not. Hang on!
What's this heap of old iron doing here?
Old iron?
I'll give you
10 bob for it.
Don't be daft.
This was once a great car.
Won the Grand Prix three years running.
So it's a car, is it?
Certainly it's a car.
It's a racing car.
And we're winning.
And you're in the way.
And you're in the way for a right belt around the ear, young man, if I have any more of your lip.
All right.
I'll give you
15 bob for it.
Make it 30 bob, and she's yours.
Mr. Coggins, you're not going to sell her, are you?
Of course he's gonna sell her.
What do you think he's running here, a children's playground or something?
All right, 30 bob.
I'll pick her up Wednesday.
But, Mr. Coggins, you promised we could play in her.
Well, I'm sorry, my dears, but she ain't any use to me.
Times are hard.
But you can't take her away.
She's not just any old car.
She's ours.
Not anymore, she ain't.
I'll see you tomorrow, Bill.
Giddy-up!
What're you going to do with her?
I'll tell you what we're gonna do with her, we're gonna put her in the clapper and we're gonna crunch her up till she's one solid piece of metal.
Then we're gonna put her in a fiery furnace, and we're gonna melt her down till she's liquid iron.
That's what we're gonna do with her.
Now look what you've done.
You've frightened her.
She shivered.
See? She's a very special car.
If you put her in the fiery furnace, you'll be guilty of murder.
Yeah, and if you don't get out of it,
I'll be guilty of two more murders.
Now go on, out of it.
Giddy-up! Giddy-up!
Please, Mr. Coggins, you can't sell our lovely car to that nasty man.
Well, I'm sorry, children, but I'm afraid
I already have.
I know!
Daddy will buy it for us.
Won't he, Jemima?
Of course he will.
Mr. Coggins, promise you won't let her go until we come back.
Well, 30 shillings, mind.
Not a penny less.
Please promise.
Please.
All right, I promise.
Come on, Jemima.
Well, that's a clever thing to do!
We're very sorry, miss.
I'm sure you are.
Well, just look at my car.
And just look what a mess I'm in, too.
Oh, no, I think you're beautiful.
And I like your car.
Hmm.
Just the same, you shouldn't be rushing across the road like that.
You know, you might have been killed.
Anyway, why aren't you in school?
It isn't a holiday, is it?
No, miss.
Do you live around here?
Yes, we live just down the road.
Come on, get into my car,
I'm taking you home.
Gosh, just wait till
Daddy hears we've been for a ride in a motorcar!
Yes!
What's your name?
I'm Jemima.
And I'm Jeremy.
What's yours?
Truly.
That's a very pretty name.
Now, where is your house?
Oh, we don't live in a house.
We live in the castle on top of the hill.
A castle? I didn't know there were any castles around here.
Well, it isn't a castle exactly.
That's what
Daddy calls it.
He says King Alfred used to live there hundreds of years ago.
And does your daddy know you aren't in school?
Oh, he won't mind.
He never does.
Anyway, he's awfully busy.
Is he?
Well, he'll have to find time to see me, because I have a few things to say to him.
JEMlMA: Edison! Edison!
JEREMY: Come here, boy!
Good boy, good boy.
That's Daddy over there.
JEMlMA: Hello!
JEREMY: Hello!
Hello.
You're just in time.
What on earth is he up to?
JEMlMA: That's his latest invention.
Rockets.
Rockets?
Stand back!
Keep clear!
Hooray!
Hooray!
Does he know what he's doing?
Of course he does.
Whoa!
Well, I don't see anything funny.
Somebody should do something about it.
Hold on! Hold on!
Wait! Wait there.
Oh!
Thank you!
I should hope so.
You might have gone up in flames.
Madam, I took that into consideration.
This suit is completely flameproof.
Oh, dear.
You have just succeeded in ruining my propulsion unit.
But how was l to know that you were. . .
Don't be cross with the lady, Daddy.
JEREMY: She gave us a ride in her car.
JEMlMA: She was only trying to help.
How very kind.
Her name's Truly.
That's nice.
Do you realize,
Mr. Potts, that I nearly knocked down your two children?
Well, we do seem to be accident-prone, don't we?
But it wasn't my fault.
You see, they came rushing out. . .
Oh, well, it was very, very nice of you to apologize.
Apologize?
Tea time, children.
Bye-bye, Truly.
Thanks for the ride.
Just a moment, you two.
Don't you have something to tell your father?
Yes, we have.
Daddy, Mr. Coggins promised us. . .
But she didn't mean about that.
Daddy, we didn't go to school today.
Oh-ho.
Well, it'll give the other children a chance to catch up, won't it?
Run along, children.
Goodbye.
Goodbye. Bye, Truly.
Come on, Edison.
But, Mr. Potts. . .
Good day!
But, but. . .
Unstable.
Definitely unstable.
Good afternoon, miss.
Sorry I can't stop.
I'm off to India.
Going to have a cup of tea with the Maharajah. Cheerio!
Mr. Potts.
I'm sorry to persist about this, but perhaps you simply aren't aware that your children were running about in the road.
And after all, you know, it's not a playground.
It's very. . .
Would you mind just pressing that switch there?
Switch?
Yes, just behind you.
On the right.
The right.
The right?
Thank you.
You really ought to try and exercise more control over them.
Yes, I suppose I could chain them up, couldn't l?
On a nice long chain, of course, so they get plenty of exercise.
Mr. Potts, don't your children go to school?
Oh, I have it now.
You're the truant officer.
No, I'm not the truant officer.
Well, didn't you ever play truant?
I mean, just once?
No, I most certainly did not.
I bet you didn't.
Would it be too much to ask what this is, this, um, thing?
A little invention of mine, cleans carpets by suction.
All that to clean carpets?
Away with sweeping, and away with brushing, and away with dirty carpets.
Is that all you do,
Mr. Potts? Invent things?
Is that all I do?
And what's this gadget?
Well, that's not quite right yet, but eventually,
I hope to transmit moving pictures by wireless.
Oh, really?
Yes, really.
That's my. . .
And this?
This, madam, is a sweet-making machine.
And is this one of the sweets?
Yes, it is.
And is it supposed to have all those holes in it?
No. Actually, I think that the problem is. . .
The boiling point of your sugar is too high.
Oh, we're an expert on sweet-making, are we?
Well, as a matter of fact. . .
And an expert on child welfare.
I was only trying to help your children.
Well, maybe my children like running wild in the street.
Did that ever occur to you?
I do not see any cause to. . .
And in any case, how my children behave is frankly no concern of yours.
I was merely trying. . .
So, if you'll be so good as to take yourself off in that fancy automobile of yours and go do good somewhere else.
Well, I've never been. . .
Spoken to that way before?
Well, maybe it's about time.
Good afternoon, madam.
Mind the cable!
Vicious, interfering. . .
If women are going to drive motorcars around, they should learn to operate one correctly.
Well, I suppose it wouldn't occur to you to offer to help me.
Get in the car. Please.
Well, for a mechanically-minded man,
Mr. Potts. . .
Try switching it on.
Oh.
Hmm!
Open the throttle!
And keep it open!
Women!
Confounded woman!
Who does she think she is?
Coming in here and telling me how to raise my children.
Do I need somebody to tell me how to raise my children?
Do l? Hmm?
No, of course not.
Of course not!
Where's my cardigan?
Under your jacket.
Under. . . Yes.
Self-righteous busybody.
She won't be bothering us again.
But I liked her.
So did l.
She was very pretty.
She certainly was.
Do you think your father's a crackpot?
Your cardigan's inside out.
Oh.
Do you think
I'm a lunatic, wasting my time on a lot of silly inventions?
But they aren't silly.
They're wonderful.
Nobody else could think of them.
That's right. That is right.
Nobody else could think of them.
Yes. After all, what makes the battle worth the fighting?
What makes the mountain worth the climb?
What makes the questions worth the asking?
The reason worth the rhyme?
(SINGING) To me, the answer's clear
It's having someone near
Someone dear
Someone to care for
To be there for
I have you two
Someone to do for
Muddle through for
I have you two
Someone to share joy or despair with
Whichever betides you
Life becomes a chore
Unless you're living for
Someone to tend to, be a friend to
I have you two
Someone to strive for
Do or die for
I have you two
Could be we three get along so famously
'Cause you two have me
And I have you two, too
BOTH: Someone to care for
To be there for
I have you two
Someone to do for
Muddle through for
I have you two
Someone to smile once in a while with
Whenever you're lonesome
I've a happy lot
Considering what I've got
But I couldn't do more
Than you do for your poor father
Daddy!
Daddy!
Things go asunder
And I wonder why you bother
ALL: Could be we three
Get along so famously 'cause
BOTH: We two have you
And I have you two
Too
Jeremy.
Oh, good.
Do I smell food?
Bring the bread, will you, Grandpa.
Yes, sir! Sir! Sir!
And pepper and salt, please.
Right away, sir!
Oh!
Sausage and egg, my favorite!
How was India?
India?
I'll tell you something.
I got up this morning, and I shot an elephant in my pajamas.
How he ever. . .
ALL: Got into my pajamas,
I shall never know.
You've heard it before.
Now, I wonder how that could have happened.
Daddy, could we ask you something?
It's about Mr. Coggins.
Mr. Coggins.
You see, the junkman wanted to take it away.
But Mr. Coggins says if we asked you first. . .
Asked me what first?
He's a horrid, mean, old man.
Mr. Coggins?
No, the junkman.
He's going to take it away and put it in a furnace.
And burn it all up.
It's terrible.
What are you going on about?
BOTH: Our car!
Yes, well, what about it?
Mr. Coggins is selling it to the junkman.
And the junkman's going to put it in the fiery furnace.
And squidge it all up till there's nothing left.
Oh, well, that's terrible.
That is terrible.
We can't let that happen, Grandpa.
No, definitely not.
We knew you wouldn't let them, Daddy.
So we made Mr.
Coggins promise we could have it if you gave him
30 shillings.
Uh, 30 shillings.
JEREMY: You can give
Mr. Coggins the money in the morning, Daddy.
Yes, well, I suppose we can work something out somehow.
Good!
Hooray!
Are you all finished?
Yes, Daddy.
Yes, thank you.
Well, I think, maybe, you should go run up to bed.
Good night, Grandpa.
Good night, my boy.
Sleep tight.
Good night, Grandpa.
Good night, my darling.
God bless you.
Good night, Daddy.
Good night.
Good night, Daddy.
Yes, well, you've done it now, haven't you?
You think Coggins might do a deal?
So much a week?
Coggins? What, him down the road? Sure.
He's so mean he wouldn't light your pipe if his house was on fire.
Did you hear that?
You know what that means, don't you?
I'll be up all night, rain pouring through my bedroom roof.
Grandpa, why don't you sleep in the workshop?
It's nice and. . .
The workshop?
You promised, faithfully, to fix my bedroom roof.
I will, Grandpa.
It's just. . .
Caractacus, please.
My boy, listen.
It's time you woke up.
When I was your age,
I did a day's work. . .
For a day's pay, polishing the Colonel's boots.
I was the smartest batman in the British Army.
So you've been telling me.
When my Brigadier went into action, the fuzzy-wuzzies were so blinded by the shine on his boots, they couldn't see to fight.
Catch me death of cold.
He doesn't care.
Nobody cares.
Me own son!
She was right.
Who wants sweets with holes in them?
Oh, Edison, stop that whistling.
Edison, hey, do that again.
Edison, you're a genius.
The employment office is in the rear.
Thank you. Oh.
You see, I've invented these sweets.
Really?
Name?
Uh. . .
Whistling Sweets.
Mr. Whistling Sweets.
Not Mr. Whistling Sweets.
No, I'm Potts.
Hmm.
May I see the managing director?
Lord Scrumptious sees no one without an appointment.
CARACTACUS: Well, how do l get an appointment?
Why, hello, children.
JEMlMA: Jeremy, it's Truly.
Hello, Truly.
Good morning,
Miss Scrumptious.
How nice to see you.
Good morning, Phillips.
Please tell my father that I'm here.
But of course,
Miss Scrumptious.
Are you here on business, Mr. Potts?
Yes, Miss. . .
Father?
Truly Scrumptious.
You're his. . .
His daughter.
Mmm-hmm.
Come on, children, let's go.
But, Daddy, you haven't shown anybody your invention.
Somehow, I don't think that'll do much good.
Just a moment,
Mr. Potts.
Exactly what was it you. . .
You've seen them.
Oh, those.
But they whistle.
Whistle?
Those holes.
You just blow through them.
They're very ingenious.
Kind of a novelty.
Please go in,
Miss Scrumptious.
You can come back in three weeks' time.
Show Mr. Potts in,
Phillips.
Now?
Now.
But his Lordship said. . .
Now.
Very well.
Please follow me.
Maybe I should come back in three weeks.
Oh, Daddy!
Go on, Daddy.
All right.
And don't let him bully you.
Yes.
Mr. Potts, milord.
Potts? Who's he?
Where's me daughter?
She insisted on
Mr. Potts seeing you.
All right, don't just stand there.
What's it all about?
Sweets, sir.
I hardly thought it was nuts and bolts.
Let's have a look.
Yes.
Hurry up, man!
Yes, sir.
If I may be allowed to explain, sir.
You have exactly
20 seconds.
Yes.
Well, the fundamental novelty of these particular sweets is their musical quality.
Not only are they remarkably tasty, but due to the unique positioning of these little holes, they are capable, when blown through, of rendering a tuneful whistle.
Place your fingers over the holes and blow thus.
Tasting time, milord.
Too late. Had your chance.
Muffed it. Good morning.
Go on. Follow him.
Milord?
CARACTACUS: Sir?
Excuse me.
Sir, if I may be allowed to demonstrate.
You see, by blowing air through this hole in the center of the sweet you get a wonderful-sounding. . .
Raspberry?
No, no.
It's more like a toot, really.
Not enough fruit, too much sugar.
Yes, milord.
Prepare the peppermint.
Beautiful. Would you care to try it, sir?
Under no circumstances.
Prepare the lemon!
He's not doing very well, is he?
You know, another remarkable feature about these little sweets is that by sucking on them. . .
Throw it away!
Will you get rid of this idiot for me?
Milord. You.
. . .in perfect pitch.
They also come in strawberry, raspberry. . .
Are you still here?
. . .lemon and. . .
And pineapple.
(MOUTHING) Go on.
Don't waste your pucker on some all-day sucker.
And don't try a toffee or cream.
If you seek perfection in sugar confection, well, there's something new on the scene.
A mouthful of cheer, a sweet without peer.
A musical morsel supreme
Toot sweets, toot sweets
The candies you whistle
The whistles you eat
Toot sweets, toot sweets
The eatable, tweetable treats
Toot sweets, toot sweets
The toot of a flute with the flavor of fruit
Toot sweets, toot sweets
No longer need candy be mute
Don't waste your pucker on some all-day sucker
And don't try a toffee or cream
If you seek perfection in sugar confection
Well, there's something new on the scene
That mouthful of cheer
That sweet without peer
That musical morsel supreme
That musical morsel supreme
BOTH: Toot sweets, toot sweets
A bonbon to blow on at last has been found
Toot sweets, toot sweets
With tweetable, eatable sound
No! Take it away!
Father, please.
He likes it!
(SINGING) Their value is intrinsic
Surpass any mint stick
BOTH: Or marshmallow mouthful you munch
Though licorice is chewy
And gumdrops are gooey
And chocolate is charming to crunch
That savory fife
That sweet of your life
It's clearly the best of the bunch
Toot sweets, toot sweets
That savory fife
That sweet of your life
Is clearly the best of the bunch
Toot sweets, toot sweets
A bonbon to blow on at last has been found
Toot sweets, toot sweets
The treat that's so tweetable
Lusciously eatable
With that unbeatable
Sound
Get out of here!
Go away!
What's going on?
Get those dogs out of here!
Edison, no!
Edison! Edison!
Children!
JEMlMA: Edison!
Edison!
It's entirely your fault.
I'll send for the police.
Daddy.
Now, why aren't you two asleep?
Don't be sad,
Daddy.
It wasn't your fault.
It was all those mean, old dogs.
Children, about the car. . .
You see,
30 shillings is pretty hard to come by.
And when I do get any money,
I need it for my inventions.
Well, there isn't any left.
Jeremy and l have been thinking.
It's our treasure chest.
These things are enormously valuable.
Look, an ivory tusk.
JEREMY: That must be worth a fortune.
JEMlMA: And diamonds.
And a golden crown.
It's probably
King Alfred's.
Of course, it needs cleaning up a little.
Take them, Daddy.
You can sell them.
And never mind about the car.
You can spend it all on your inventions.
Thank you, children.
All these wonderful things, they're very precious.
But I'm afraid other people wouldn't appreciate them.
Why not, Daddy?
Because other people don't see things the way you do.
Come on, now.
Let's go to bed.
And don't you worry.
Things are going to come right somehow.
(SINGING) A gentle breeze from Hushabye Mountain
Softly blows o'er Lullaby Bay
It fills the sails of boats that are waiting
Waiting to sail your worries away
It isn't far to Hushabye Mountain
And your boat waits down by the quay
The winds of night so softly are sighing
Soon they will fly your troubles to sea
So close your eyes on Hushabye Mountain
Wave goodbye to cares of the day
And watch your boat from Hushabye Mountain
Sail far away from Lullaby Bay
(CIRCUS MARCH
PLAYlNG DlSTANTLY)
All the lovely colors.
Two for the price of one.
Get your balloons here!
MAN: Hurry, hurry, hurry along now.
Don't miss these lovely toffee apples!
Hurry along now!
Get your toffee apples at 8p each.
Thank you very much, young man.
Any more for any more?
Which one of you lovely ladies and gentlemen would like a splendid, automatic haircut?
I've stood in this marketplace for 25 years.
I do not profess to make dead men talk!
(LOUDLY) Hey, now, here you go then. Who's for an automatic haircut?
Only three pence a time.
You may have long hair, you may have short hair, sir, you may have straight hair, it makes no difference to the Potts automatic and hygienic, electronic hair-cutting machine!
Come on.
You could do with a haircut.
Cut me hair?
That's where me strength is.
Excuse me, sir, you look like a man who could do with a haircut.
Bah!
Yeah, go on! Go on.
Come on, sit down.
Hold that, then.
My word, you have a lot of hair.
Would you like an estimate, sir?
Very funny.
Go on, get on with it.
You just sit tight, sir, while I lower this hair-cutting machine.
There we are.
You just relax, we'll have you finished in a bit.
I feel like a real right nana sitting here.
No, you look lovely, Cyril.
It's going to be smashing.
You keep your eyes on that geezer.
Yeah, all right, then.
What's going on?
It's all right,
Cyril, it's all right.
Nothing to worry about, sir, a little friction to start.
It tickles!
Oh, you always say that, Cyril.
Oh! Oh! Oh!
Cyril, you're smoking!
I'm on fire!
Stop it!
Oh!
Excuse me!
Me head's on fire!
It's all right, sir.
What you done?
Give me a mirror.
Let's have a look.
A mirror?
I'll go home and get you one.
Me hair! Look at me hair!
Where is he?
I'll kill him!
There he is, mister!
Cyril!
I'll smash your teeth down your throat!
You!
Come on, you're too fat to catch him!
Oi! Big bonce!
Get out of here.
There he is!
Get out of my way!
Oi!
Here, hurry up.
We're on.
Get out of the way!
Get out of it!
(SINGING) A gentleman's got a walking stick
A seaman's got a gaff
And the merry men of Robin Hood
They used a quarterstaff
On the Spanish plains, inside their canes
They hide their ruddy swords
But we make do with an old bamboo
And everyone applauds
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight
Me old bamboo, me old bamboo
You better never bother with me old bamboo
You can have me hat or me bumbershoot
But you better never bother with me old bamboo
When punting on the beautiful Thames
You use a sturdy pole
To protect their fair complexion
Ladies use a parasol
It's useful in the underbrush
To have a hefty spear
Right!
But what we do with an old bamboo
Makes everybody cheer
One, two, three
Me old bamboo, me old bamboo
You better never bother with me old bamboo
You can have me hat or me bumbershoot
But you better never bother with me old bamboo
Have a go, mate!
A flier in an aerial plane
He steers it with a stick
He does?
A collier in the pits of Wales
He leans upon his pick
That's right
Now every wheel of an automobile
Revolves around a shaft
But what we do with an old bamboo
Makes everyone go daft
And one, two
Me old bamboo, me old bamboo
You better never bother with me old bamboo
You can have me hat or me bumbershoot
But you better never bother with me old bamboo
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight
And a-one, two, three, four
And a-five and six and seven
Me old bamboo, me old bamboo
You better never bother with me old bamboo
You can have me hat or me bumbershoot
But you better never bother with me old bamboo
You better never bother with me old bamboo
Thank you.
Here, thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.
CHlLDREN: It's Daddy!
It's Daddy! He's got the car!
Look! I've got it!
He's got the car!
He's got the car!
Come on! Come on!
Come on!
Hello!
BOTH: The car!
What do you think of this?
Isn't she a beauty?
Oh, Daddy! Oh!
That's a nice pile of junk you got there, my boy.
Well, it needs a little work, but there's a fine engine under here.
GRANDPA: It doesn't go, though, does it?
No, not yet, but it will. It will.
You can make it go, can't you, Daddy?
Well, I'm gonna give it a try.
All right, come on, everybody, put a hand to the wheel.
George, give us a hand here, will you?
Yes, sir.
Okay, heave!
JEMlMA: We're off!
We're off! Hooray!
Comfortable, Grandpa?
Won't work, of course.
Another catastrophe.
Left hand down.
JEREMY: Come on,
Grandpa, push!
Watch it, Jeremy.
Mind the bicycle.
JEMlMA: Push.
Good. Keep coming, Jeremy.
That's it. Keep coming.
Look out, Edison.
Watch out, Edison.
Look out, Edison.
That's it.
Keep coming.
Good. Whoa! That's it.
Whoa!
All right, governor.
Many, many thanks, George.
Right.
Now. . .
Can we stay and watch, Daddy?
Yes!
No, come on, my dears, we'd better go.
You know what your dad's like when he's working.
JEMlMA: But, Grandpa, we wanted to stay and watch.
GRANDPA: Come back in the house, darling.
I'll make you a nice cup of tea.
Don't overdo it, will you, my boy?
Right, Grandpa.
You might exhaust yourself.
Come on!
"And the big brown bear
"came lolloping over the mountain.
"'No, no,' the princess cried.
"And the big brown bear came lolloping over the mountain."
It's awfully quiet in there.
Come on, children, breakfast is ready.
He's been there for days!
Will you please come and have your breakfast?
But Daddy said the car would be finished today.
Darling, you'll be waiting a month of Sundays before he's finished that.
Come on.
Be good children.
Come on.
That's Daddy!
The car.
He's finished the car!
Gosh!
Oh!
Well, what do you think of her?
JEMIMA: She's the most beautiful thing
I ever saw in my life!
It's wonderful! Oh, Daddy, you're so clever.
Oh, yes.
Can we go for a drive?
For a drive?
A drive. A drive.
I have a better idea.
How about a picnic?
BOTH: Hooray!
A picnic! A picnic.
All right?
Let's get cracking.
You get the basket out of the workshop.
Get in, Jemima.
Hooray! Hooray!
Hurry! Mind the woodwork.
Mind the woodwork.
Don't touch.
Don't touch the horn.
Here's the basket, Daddy.
Oh, yes.
Just put it on the back.
All right.
Now. Don't touch that.
BOTH: Grandfather! Come on.
We're going on a picnic.
Get aboard, Grandpa.
Come on, come on.
It'll never go, my dears.
Not if he's had anything to do with it.
But it is going!
Hooray!
Then it'll never stop.
Anyway, it's far too hot.
Where are you going?
Me? I'm off to Alaska, me boy. Cheerio!
BOTH: Goodbye, Grandpa!
Come on, Daddy!
All right.
Come on!
Come on!
We're off!
Hooray!
We're off! We're off!
Sit down, Jemima, sit down.
Are you ready?
Yes!
Here we go!
Hooray!
Mind your back, Grandpa.
Bye, Grandpa.
Nasty, smelly things, motorcars!
What a funny noise it's making!
It's talking to us.
All engines talk.
What's it saying?
It's saying, chitty, chitty, chitty, chitty.

Daddy!
Look out!
You'll find a slight squeeze on the hooter an excellent safety precaution,
Miss Scrumptious.
Never mind about that.
How am I supposed to get out of here?
Well, looks to me as if you have to walk.
Or swim.
What? In this dress?
Oh, don't be ridiculous,
Mr. Potts.
Come on.
(STAMMERING) What are you gonna do?
I'm gonna carry you.
Oh, dear, must you?
Well, unless you'd rather ride piggyback.
All right.
You may carry me.
Good.
Wait, wait, wait.
My handbag. Oh!
Whoa! Oh!
It's all right.
Thank you.
Not at all.
We're going to the seaside.
On a picnic.
Come with us.
Please.
Well, I'm hardly in the mood for a picnic just now.
Well, you needn't worry about your car.
I can have Mr. Coggins tow it out.
Well, I. . .
We've got sausage tarts.
And marmalade rolls.
I'm afraid I got 'em a little mixed up.
What an unusual car.
Daddy made it.
Oh. And it actually goes?
It's called
Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.
That's a curious name for a motorcar.
But that's the sound it makes.
Listen.

BOTH: Hooray!
CHlLDREN: Hooray!
Oops!
I'm so glad you came.
It's much more fun with two grownups.
Truly Scrumptious.
You know, even if we didn't know your name, we could have guessed it.
Oh?
You had to be called something lovely.
Like Yum Yum!
Or Angel Cake.
Or Toot Sweets.
Yes. Toot Sweets.
(LAUGHS) Toot Sweets?
Oh, no.
(SINGING) Toot sweets sound like what they are
So do lollies in a lollipop jar
Gingerbread men have a gingerbread sound
We've found
Sugarplum, cinnamon, and lemon tart
Tell you what they are right from the start
And your name does the same for you
By coincidence,
Truly Scrumptious
You're truly, truly scrumptious
Scrumptious as a cherry peach parfait
When you're near us
It's so delicious
Honest, Truly
You're the answer to our wishes
Truly Scrumptious
Though we may seem presumptuous
Never, never ever go away
Our hearts beat so unruly
Because we love you truly
Aw!
Honest, Truly
We do
CHlLDREN: Daddy! Daddy!
Boo!
Truly scrumptious
You two are truly scrumptious
Scrumptious as the breeze across the bay
When you're smiling
It's so delicious
So beguiling
You're the answer to my wishes
Truly scrumptious
You two are truly scrumptious
And I shan't forget this lovely day
My heart beats so unruly
I also love you truly
Honest, truly
I do
Come on.
Hey, wait for me!
Mr. Potts.
Somebody call?
Oh. (GROANS)
Oh! Oh, I'm sorry.
That's all right.
What are you doing?
Oh, just tinkering.
Oh.
You know, Mr. Potts, you have two wonderful children.
Why, thank you.
I must agree with you there.
Isn't it beautiful?
Lovely. Just lovely.
Jeremy, it's not nice to peek.
I'm not peeking,
I'm looking.
Do you think they like each other?
Of course they do.
Do you think they're going to get married?
Has he kissed her yet?
Not yet.
Well, just as soon as he kisses her then they'll have to get married.
JEMIMA: Jeremy, what are you doing?
JEREMY: I'm keeping a lookout for pirates.
There aren't any pirates around here, are there, Truly?
Oh, I'm sure there are.
Hundreds of them.
'Course there are.
This is where they bury their treasure, isn't it, Daddy?
Mmm-hmm.
Tell us a story about pirates, Daddy.
A story about pirates, huh?
Well, let me see.
A boat!
I can see a boat!
A boat?
Did you say, "a boat"?
That isn't just any old boat out there.
No?
No?
(lN GERMAN ACCENT) No.
That is a private yacht of the notorious Baron Bomburst.
Baron Bomburst?
Baron Bomburst?
You have never heard of Baron Bomburst, ruler of Vulgaria?
The most evil man in the world!
CHlLDREN: Oh!
Yeah.
And he has sailed all the way to England because he has heard tell of a fantastic motorcar built by that brilliant inventor
Caractacus Potts.
Hooray!
Hooray!
Yes, hooray!
And he has come to steal the car and take it back to
Vulgaria with him.
CHILDREN: No!
Yeah.
MAN: (EXCLAIMS) Yes!
That car!
MAN: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I want it! I want it!
I want it! I want it!
But, Your Excellency. . .
Are you giving me an argument?
No, Your Excellency.
Stand by the boats!
Stand by the boats!
Man the grappling hooks.
Man the grappling hooks.
And load the cannon!
Load the cannon!
He's awful.
He's terrible.
Not only that, he isn't even nice.
But he can't steal our lovely car!
You won't let him, will you, Daddy?
Look!
They're getting closer.
We've got to get away!
Start the car.
Quickly, Daddy, before they get here.
Well, now, that's easier said than done.
But why, Daddy? Why?
Well, I'll tell you.
What none of us have noticed is while we've been sitting here, the tide has been coming in.
Now, we're completely cut off.
What are we going to do?
Do hurry, Mr. Potts!
Now don't panic.
Everyone, stay calm!
Quickly, Daddy.
Quickly. Hurry up.
Look! They are completely cut off by the tide.
They will all drown!
I haven't seen a good drowning in years!
Is there anything
I can do to help?
The throttle.
Push the throttle lever.
JEREMY: Hurry, Daddy! Hurry!
Quickly, Daddy, before they get here!
No, not that one, the other one!
It's no good.
It won't start!
We're gonna have to swim for it.
Come on, Jemima.
We must. Come on.
Come on, Jeremy.
We have to.
Come on, everybody over the side.
Quickly! (GASPS)
It's starting to change!
CARACTACUS:
Everybody, hold on!
TRULY: It's unbelievable!
Mr. Potts, it's so clever!
This is impossible!
But you built it!
It's a magic car.
You always said it was a magic car.
I did?
JEREMY: Yes. Look, it's like a boat!
I knew Chitty would save us!
Hang on, everybody!
We're off!
A floating car?
What do you think of that, Chancellor?
Yeah, Baron.
A car floating, floating on the water.
This, in my whole life long, it never could be seen, never, never.
It's uncategorical!
A fuel-burning oracle.
Phantasmagorical machine!
(SINGING) It's more than spectacular
To use the vernacular
It's wizard
It's smashing
It's keen
Oh, Chitty, you Chitty
Pretty Chitty Bang Bang
Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, we love you
And, Chitty, our Chitty
Pretty Chitty Bang Bang
Chitty Chitty Bang Bang loves us too
High Chitty, low Chitty, anywhere we go
On Chitty Chitty we depend
Bang Bang,
Chitty Chitty Bang Bang
Our fine four-fendered friend
They're firing at us!
All right.
We'll show them something.
Follow that car!
Follow that car!
My word!
I want the car!
I want that car!
I must have it!
Follow the car!
Stop that car!
After them! Faster!
I want the car!
I must have it!
Action stations, everybody.
We're going ashore!
Get out!
Where are my two spies?
Ah, there you are.
Now, then, I have a secret mission for you.
You will go ashore, and you will capture that motorcar, understand?
Good.
But if you fail,
I will cut off your heads.
Out.
I want that car!
Now, then, where are we?
I have here a map.
I know where we are, stupid!
We are in England!
And when we are in England, what do we do?
We play cricket!
We play. . .
No. We dress like Englishmen.
BOTH: A-ha!
Remarkable weather we are having for the time of year.
Do you not think so, Cuthbort?
Indubitably, Basil.
You know, Mr. Potts. . .
Caractacus.
It's a pretty silly name, isn't it?
Oh, I don't think so.
You know,
I really owe you an apology.
You're more than just a father to those two children.
Oh, yes.
Nursemaid, private tutor, chief, cook, and bottle washer.
Everything.
Except what they really need.
Well, it's been quite a day.
Yes, certainly has.
Thank you, (WHISPERING) and say goodbye to the children for me.
Yes, I will.
I hope we'll see you again.
I hope so, too. Goodbye.
Goodbye.
(SINGING) This lovely, lonely man
I've only known a day
I look at him
And cannot look away
Oh, what a love
Oh, what a lovely, lonely man
I've met so many men
So easy to forget
I thought I'd grown immune to them
And yet
He's such a love
He's such a lovely, lonely man
How did he touch my heart?
How did this feeling start?
This glow that feels so warm inside
This sudden summer storm inside
My life now has a plan
To someday make him see
That I need him as much as he needs me
Oh, what a love
Oh, what a lovely, lonely man
My life now has a plan
To someday make him see
That I need him as much as he needs me
Oh, what a love
Oh, what a lovely, lonely man
Oh, how I love this one and only man
Quickly! Quickly!
They're coming!
They're coming!
Hurry! They're coming!
Quickly! Quickly!
Come on. Hurry.
Come on! Come on!
They're coming!
Get ready.
Get ready. Fire!
Stop, stop, stop!
This way.
No! Stop! Stop, stop.
They're trying to get past, Daddy.
Fine.
Go on.
Get over, you half-wit.
It's Father. And he's in one of his tempers.
Oh, that'll be a change.
You'd better let him pass.
I can't.
There isn't room.
Get out of the way.
Move over, you idiot!
Turn off here.
What do you think you're doing?
We've got him!
Drive away from here.
Whoa!
LORD SCRUMPTIOUS:
You nincompoops!
I'll have you sent away for the rest of your natural lives.
I suppose you blue-faced baboons have some explanation for this outrage.
You stupid fool!
Why? What have I done?
What have you. . .
Ah, ah!
I have an idea.
Now, remember, we are supposed to be
English gentlemen.
So let us try and behave like
English gentlemen.
So open the door!
Caracatacacus Potts.
Inventor.
Typical English eccentric.
That must be the inventor.
Hmm.
Pardon me for protruding, but have I the pleasure of addressing Herr...
(CLEARS THROAT) Mr. Potts?
Yes, that's me.
What do you want?
You selling something?
I don't want nothing.
Excuse me.
I'm off to Africa.
Africa. (CHUCKLES)
That was a ruse to put us off the scent.
I know where he has gone.
Where? Where?
He has gone into his laboratory.
Quick! The portable wireless transmitter!
(MAN SPEAKING GERMAN
ON TRANSMlTTER)
This is X speaking.
Schrecks?
No. X.
Lecks?

Lower the ladder.
Get up the ladder!
Quickly. Get up.
Ow!

Take it up! Up. Up.
Now over here! Up. Up.
Wait for me!
God!
Hello!
What's your game, then?
What's going on?
Oi, I'm flying!
Look!
JEREMY: What's that?
JEMlMA: It's a big balloon.
JEREMY: It's a zeppelin.
What's that underneath?
That's. . .
That's Grandpa's hut.
But what's it doing up there?
Well, I don't know.
Help me! Caractacus, my boy.
I'm being kidnapped!
Grandpa, what do you think you're doing?
You come down here!
Caractacus! My boy, it's me, your own father!
Caractacus!
They're not getting away with that.
Grandpa!
Hold tight, back there.
Sit down, Jeremy.
Quickly, Daddy, quickly!
Hurry, Daddy.
Caractacus!
Grandpa!
CARACTACUS: Hold on, Grandpa!
We're coming!
Help!
JEMlMA: Come back, Grandpa!
Hey, Grandpa, come back.
What do you think you're doing?
I'm being abducted by foreigners! Caractacus!
Hey!
Grandpa!
Faster, Daddy, faster.
Where do they think they're going?
(GASPS) Look out!
JEMlMA: Daddy! Daddy!
Daddy!
(CHITTY CHITTY BANG BANG
PLAYING)
Grandpa!
Grandpa!
Where do they think they're going?
(GASPS) Look out!
JEMlMA: Daddy! Daddy!
Daddy!
What's happening?
Look.
Look at that.
It's fantastic.
Oh!
You're a genius.
It's nothing, really.
Look! There they are!
JEREMY: Come on, Daddy, after them.
Right, we'll catch them up.
Oh!
Oh, we've lost them.
We'll find them, all right.
But what about Grandpa?
Don't worry about Grandpa.
Grandpa can take care of himself.

This is elegance by the mile

First cabin and captain's table regal company
Whenever I'm bored,

Last month I missed a mufti
Well, you can't oblige them all
Oh, the posh, posh traveling life
The traveling life for me
We're still losing height?
There must be something else we can throw out.
But there's nothing else we can throw out.
There's nothing else we. . .
No, no, no! No, no, no!
You just dropped someone!
I can't swim!
Come back. Come back!
Come back! Come back!
Oh, the posh, posh traveling life

What do we do now?
Start swimming!
I don't swim.
Then start drowning!
GRANDPA: P-O-S-H
P-O-S-H, posh
Hello.
Where are we?
Somewhere over the North Sea, I think.
Don't you know where we're going?
No, I don't, but Chitty does.
I think we're in pretty good hands.
BARON: Good morning.
This is your
Captain speaking.
We hope you had a pleasant trip.
In a few moments we will be landing in Vulgaria.
Where?
Vulgaria.
Oh.
So, please, fasten your seat belts.
And no smoking.
Thank you.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Speed, four and a half knots, sir.
Wind, east-southeast, sir.
Brigade, attention!
Present arms!
We have a guest.
Welcome him.
Jawohl, your Excellency.
Order arms!
Ah, Professor Potts.
Please, to walk this way.
Present arms!
On behalf of
Her Majesty The Queen,
I'd like. . .
Oi! (WHISTLES)
Excuse me.
You're early!
Oh!
Down the table and in the pocket.
Cheat, cheat, cheat.
Ah, Professor Potts!
Professor?
Vulgaria welcomes the brilliant
Professor Potts, inventor extraordinaire.
Excuse me, sir.
There seems to be some sort of mistake.
What?
You are not Professor Potts, the inventor?
Well, l. . .
Executioner!
ALL: Executioner!
What would you like me to invent, sir?
I will show you. My horse!
MAN: Get the horse for his Excellency.
Giddy-up.
How proud you look on that fine horse.
The most beautiful toy you ever bought me, my darling.
But who is this?
This is Professor Potts from England.
How do you do, madam?
And I think we have a surprise for you.
Herr Professor, come on.
(BIDDING FAREWELL
IN FRENCH)
Well, what do you think, professor?
Everything you need.
And these will be your assistants.
And here, this is the Baronial car.
Can you make this car float?
Float?
Like amphibial
English moty car, float over the cresty wave of the water.
Yes, sir, but you see, it's not that easy without my laboratory.
Oh, I have already thought of that.
Here is your lavatory.
If you succeed in making the car float,
I will make you privy councilor.
But if you fail,
I will stuff your head with sauerkraut and feed you to the dogs!
Feedy dorribles, snarly (SNORTS) horribold.
You have got 24 hours!
Twenty-four hours and worky nosy grindstone.
Proper card he is.
Odd sense of humor.
Stuff me head with sauerkraut.
The Baron never makes jokes.
Look at us.
We've been here for years and years.
I came here to repair the telephone.
That was 24 years ago.
They have terrible tortures.
The thumbscrew and rack.
They stretch you and stretch you!
When I first came here,
I was a midget.
Come on.
Me? Floating car?
Well, that's impossible!
Nothing's impossible.
Now, that's what my son's always saying.
We'll help you, won't we, lads?
Nil desperandum.
We'll succeed. You'll see.
Courage, man, courage.
(SINGING) Every bursted bubble has a glory
Each abysmal failure makes a point
Every glowing path that goes astray
Shows you how to find a better way
So every time you stumble, never grumble
Next time you'll bumble even less
For up from the ashes
Up from the ashes
Grow the roses of success
Grow the roses
Grow the roses of success
Oh, yes!
Grow the roses
Those rosy roses
From the ashes of disaster grow the roses of success
Yes. I know, but he wants it to float.
It will!
For every big mistake you make
Be grateful
Hear, hear!
That mistake you'll never make again
No, sir
Every shiny dream that fades and dies
Generates the steam for two more tries
There's magic in the wake of a fiasco
Correct!
It gives you that chance to second guess
Oh, yes!
Then up from the ashes
Up from the ashes
Grow the roses of success
Grow the roses
Grow the roses
Grow the roses of success
Grow the roses
Those rosy roses
From the ashes of disaster grow the roses of success
Disaster didn't stymie Louis Pasteur
No, sir
Edison took years to see the light
Right
Alexander Graham knew failure well
He took a lot of knocks to ring that bell
So when it gets distressing, it's a blessing
Onward and upward you must press
Yes, yes
Till up from the ashes
Up from the ashes
Grow the roses of success
Grow the roses
Grow the roses of success
Grow the roses
Those rosy roses
From the ashes of disaster grow the roses of success
Start the engine!
Success!
Batten the hatches!
Success!
Man the shrouds!
Lift the anchor!
Success!
Oh, Daddy, we'll never find him.
We must keep looking.
Look, look!
What's that down there?
CARACTACUS: A-ha!
Let's have a look.
Look!
The zeppelin.
JEREMY: We've found Grandpa!
CARACTACUS: No, not yet, we haven't.
BARON: What's that?
No, no, no.
What's happening?
MAN: Remarkable.
Your Excellency!
Your Excellency!
We're being attacked!
Attacked?
Attacked!
That was that terrible Bomburst.
It certainly was.
Where are they going?
Where did they go?
Look, it's a car!
Look, that car's flying!
Floating in the heavenly abode, four peoplebodes.
There they are!
Fire!
What's the matter with you?
Do you want to destroy my beautiful car?
They're firing at us.
Children.
There are children up there.
Children!
We'd better get away from here.
Now, hang on, everybody.
We're coming in to land.
Your Excellency, it's landing in the village.
In the village.
Call out the guards!
Everybody, charge!
And call out the child catcher.
Charge.
Charge! Charge!
Oh.
Let me in!
JEMlMA: Hooray!
We've landed! Hooray!
We've landed!
Hooray! Hooray!
Isn't Chitty wonderful?
Aren't you clever, Daddy?
Yes, he certainly is.
All right. You all stay here.
I'm going up to that castle.
We want to come, too.
We want to help you find Grandpa.
Don't you think we ought to stay together?
Maybe you're right.
All right, come along.
Come on, children.
TRULY: I wonder where we are.
CARACTACUS:
I don't know.
Come on.
Pardon me, sir.
The castle?
What's the matter with him?
Come on.
What are they staring at?
I don't know.
It seems to be the children.
What's the matter with them?
Haven't they seen children before?
Haven't you noticed?
There aren't any children.
Not one.
What's going on?
What's happening?
What's. . .
Hey, you. What's happening?
What's going on?
What is it?
Soldiers! Soldiers!
Hey, you there.
Get those children in here.
Would you mind telling me what's happening?
Quickly, before the soldiers get here.
Soldiers?
Come, Fräulein.
Quickly, quickly.
Get inside.
Just a minute.
Would somebody mind telling me what's going on?
Please don't talk.
We must get those children out of sight.
Jeremy!
If the soldiers find them, they will take them away.
But why? What for?
It's the law.
Nobody's allowed to have children in Vulgaria.
Not allowed?
What about these toys?
The Baroness, she hates children.
Who could hate children?
Quickly, down there!
Whatever you do, don't make a sound.
I want every house in this square to be searched from top to bottom!
Jawohl, Captain!
The first section, step out over there and search!
The second section, over there and search.
Quick!
Section three, over there.
Quick! Search!
Search everywhere!
Giddy-up! Giddy-up!
There are children here somewhere.
I can smell them.
A-ha!
Captain,
I think we've got them.
Lieutenant.
You two men, break down this door.
Quick! Quick!
Yes, sir!
Get this door open.
Quickly!
All right! I'm coming!
I'm coming!
Open the door!
Break the door down!
Quickly!
You have no right to come into here.
You've no right.
Search the place!
Search! Search!
A-ha!
They are here somewhere.
I can feel it in my bones.
There are children here somewhere.
Children?
In the toy shop?
Such a notion.
I mean. . .
What do you think you're you doing?
That's something special for the Baron's birthday.
Let me tell you, toymaker.
This nose of mine has never failed me, and if there are children here, my friend, you will die.
A-ha!
Quick! Open it up!
Get down there and search the cellar!
The Baroness will have your teeth for a necklace and your eyeballs for earrings.
Nobody down here, sir.
Fool! ldiot!
Out of my way!
You have to know where to look.
Like cockroaches, they get under the floors, in the cracks in the walls, in the woodwork.
I don't trust a man who makes toys in a land where children are forbidden.
Every toy I make is exclusively for his
Excellency, the Baron.
SOLDlER: Captain, Captain, the flying car!
We've captured the flying car!
CAPTAlN: Come on!
Let's go!
Uh-huh!
Take this car to the castle!
They can't take
Chitty, Daddy.
Daddy, do something.
They can't take
Chitty away.
What are you going to do?
Well, I don't know, but I'm not just gonna stand here.
Are you mad?
Are you going to take on the whole Vulgarian Army single-handed?
What kind of a country is this?
No children!
Everybody terrified out of their lives.
My friend, take some good advice.
Take your children and your good lady and get out of Vulgaria.
And leave Grandpa up in the castle?
Oh, no.
We came to get him out, that's what we're gonna do.
Just tell me how to get there.
Look, I'm only a toymaker.
And if I don't finish this in time for the Baron's birthday tomorrow,
I shall be a dead toymaker.
All right. I'll go myself.
Truly, you stay here with the children.
All right. All right.
You don't know what you're letting yourself in for, believe me.
Here's one for you, one for you.
Thank you.
Thank you, toymaker.
Keep them out of sight, please!
You be good children.
And you do what
Truly tells you.
Yes, Daddy.
We will.
TOYMAKER:
Well, are you coming?
(SOFTLY) Come.
Quickly, quickly, quickly.
There isn't a scrap of food in the place.
I'm so hungry, my tummy hurts.
Mine's making funny noises.
I simply must find something for you.
Now, if you promise me not to move from here until I come back. . .
We promise, don't we, Jemima?
Yes.
Now, you remember, you stay right here.
To get in that way, you would have to be a mouse or a magician.
We should go down now before a sentry sees us.
Come. Come.
Ah, the flying car!
At last it's mine!
Send for the inventor!
Then, fly!
Fly.
Yes, fly.
Come on, fly.
Fly, fly, fly. Oh.
I command you to fly!
Bring him over here.
Over here.
Hello.
What's this doing here?
You're the inventor.
Make this car fly.
Make it fly. Go get in.
Stand back, everyone!
We are going to fly.
Stand back.
Yoo-hoo, Bombie!
Wait for me!
No, every time I want to have a little fun, she turns up.
There you are. Get in.
My darling, we're going for a fly.
How exciting.
Fly. How thrilling.
Very well. Come on.
Hurry up.
Yes, yes,
I'm doing my best, sir.
Now just a minute.
Here's one that we haven't tried yet.
Here we go, my beloved.
Hold on!
Isn't it exciting, my dear?
Oh!
You're a genius.
My guns! Bring my guns!
Don't worry.
I'll get you down.
I've been waiting for this for 20 years.
Hold on, my love.
Are you still there, my love?
Don't move.
There she is,
Your Excellency.
Oh! Oh! My God.
My diamonds.
Are you all right, my dear?
I'm all right, my dumpling.
Good.
Never mind.
I'll get her the next time.
Here we are, children.
Come and get your lollipops.
Lollipops.
Come along, my little ones.
Lollipops.
Ice cream, chocolate, all free today.
Listen.
Come along, children.
Lollipops.
What's that?
Children, where are you?
I know you're here somewhere.
I've lots of lovely goodies for you.
Jeremy, you mustn't.
Lollipops.
And all free today.
Cherry pies. Cream puffs. lce cream. Treacle tarts.
Treacle tarts!
And ice creams.
And all free!
Come along, kiddie-winkies.
Come on!
But, Jeremy,
Truly said we mustn't. . .
We'll get Truly some as well. Come on.
Mr. Man!
Hey! Wait!
Children!
Come back here!
Wait! Wait!
Come along, my little dears, my little mice. Come to me.
What will it be? lce cream?
Yes, ice cream!
Strawberry, chocolate, vanilla?
Strawberry! Chocolate!
It's all inside.
Yes, strawberry!
Come along, my little dears.
Goodie! Come on. Yes!
Come inside.
Not a penny to pay.
Yes, come on.
Get in.
Go inside, my little dears!
No. Help, help!
Help!
Help!
Help!
Children! Children!
CARACTACUS: Truly!
Help! Help!
Help! Help!
What is it?
What's happened?
The children!
He took the children!
Your Excellency!
Let us out!
Let us out!
Silence!
Children,
Your Highness.
Foreign children.
Unique specimens.
You're sure they can't get out?
No, Your Highness.
Perhaps Your Highness would care to examine them.
Nasty little creatures.
Very, very treacherous.
Foreign.
Just you wait till our daddy hears about this.
He'll come and blow up the whole castle!
Take them away to the tower.
To the tower!
Nasty, horrid, mean old lady.
And very ugly.
Oh, she's going!
She's going!
Two hundred feet above us through that solid rock is the castle of
Baron Bomburst.
These are our children.
For 12 years, we have hidden them here.
Look at them.
They don't know what a tree looks like or what it is to run or to laugh in the sunshine.
Do you, eh?
Food!
Get the food here.
Come on!
There's bread for everyone.
Look at them.
Like little rats, they run up and down the sewers, stealing food from the kitchens.
. . .potatoes.
Here, catch!
Son! Son!
I'm looking for my children.
I think they're up there in the castle with their grandfather.
Have you seen anything of them?
No, sir.
A little boy and girl?
Yes.
They're locked up in the tower.
And the grandfather?
He's in the dungeon under the castle.
Sir, have you come to help us?
Are you going to take us out of here?
What's your name, son?
Peter, sir.
Well, Peter, you shouldn't be afraid, even in a terrible place like this, because there's always hope.
That's what I always tell my children when they're afraid.
(SINGING) A gentle breeze from Hushabye Mountain
Softly blows o'er Lullaby Bay
It fills the sails of boats that are waiting
Waiting to sail
So close your eyes on Hushabye Mountain
Wave goodbye to cares of the day
And watch your boat from Hushabye Mountain
Sail far away from Lullaby Bay
Is that the only advice you have to offer, my friend? Hmm?
It's a beautiful dream,
Caractacus, but I don't see how it's gonna help them.
You know what we're gonna do?
We're gonna get up into that castle.
It is impossible!
Well, we'll see.
Now, everybody listen to me.
You want to get out of here, don't you?
ALL: Yes! Yes!
Tomorrow is
Baron Bomburst's birthday, yes?
Well, we're gonna give him a birthday party he'll never forget.
I want everybody to gather around here.
I have an idea.
Yes, come in closer.
All right, quiet!
(SINGING) Happy birthday to me
Happy birthday to me
Happy birthday, dear Bombie...
Don't move. What a picture!
Such memories it brings back.
My little dumpling!
(SINGING) You're my little chu-chi face
My coot-chi, coot-chi woot-chi little chu-chi face
Every time I look at you
I sigh
And you're my little teddy bear
My lovey lovey dovey little teddy bear
Yoo-hoo!
You're the Apfelstrudel of mein eye
Your chu-chi woot-chi nose
Your chu-chi woot-chi eyes
They set my heart aflutter
Your oot-chi, coot-chi ways
Your oot-chi, coot-chi gaze
Wilts me down like melting butter
You're my little chu-chi face
And you're my teddy bear
Together we're a chu-chi, woot-chi, oot-chi, coot-chi pair
Whatever you may ask becomes my happy task
I only live to serve you
I never will divine what magic made you mine
I only know
I don't deserve you
You're my little chu-chi face
And you're my teddy bear
Together we're a chu-chi, woot-chi, oot-chi, coot-chi
Chu-chi
Woot-chi
Oot-chi
Coot-chi
Chu-chi, woot-chi, oot-chi, coot-chi pair
Oh, what a rotten birthday party.
Never mind, my little Bombie.
I have a surprise for you.
Surprises?
Oh, I love surprises!
Sit down quickly.
Summon the toymaker!
Come on! Come on! Hurry up!
Don't waste time!
Your Excellency, may I be permitted to wish you all you wish yourself on this happy occasion.
Never mind all that.
What have you made me for my birthday?
What have I made you?
Such a toy!
Such a work of mechanical perfection.
Well, well, well, where is it?
Bring it in!
Right away.
I'll just get it for you.
Bring in the Baron's birthday present!
TOYMAKER: Here, here, here.
This year, Your Excellency,
I have surpassed even myself.
Put it down there.
Careful! Careful with it!
For months,
I have been working night und day perfecting every little detail to bring you this!
Dolls? Dolls?
I have hundreds of dolls!
(CRYING) No dolls.
But this is not just an ordinary doll,
Your Excellency.
You see?
(SINGING) What do you see?
You people gazing at me
You see a doll on a music box
That's wound by a key
How can you tell
I'm under a spell?
I'm waiting for love's first kiss
You cannot see
How much I long to be free
Turning around on this music box
That's wound by a key
Yearning
While
I'm
Turning around and around
(SINGING) What do you see?
Truly Scrumptious
You people gazing at me
You're truly, truly scrumptious
You see a doll on a music box
Scrumptious...
That's wound by a key
How can you tell
I'm under a spell?
I'm waiting for love's first kiss
Honest, Truly
You're the answer to my wishes
You cannot see
Truly Scrumptious
How much
I long to be free
Though I may seem presumptuous
Turning around on this music box
That's wound by a key
Yearning
My heart beats so unruly
Yearning
Because I love you truly
While I'm
Honest, Truly
I do
Turning around and around
Just a minute!
Oh, I'm so happy,
I could jump for joy!
Come on!
Follow me.
Children! No! No!
BARON: No! No!
No!
Let me down!
Call out the cavalry!
Let me down!
TRULY: Jeremy!
CARACTACUS: Jemima!
TRULY: Jeremy!
They could be anywhere.
You look down that way.
I'll go this way.
Jeremy! Jemima!
Jeremy and Jemima!
Jeremy! Jemima!
It's Truly!
Truly! We're in here!
Don't worry.
We'll get you out of here in a minute.
Here! Here, quick.
Quick, they're in there.
Children, are you all right?
CHlLDREN: Get us out of here!
We found them.
They're in there. Come on.
Help me break the door down.
Children, get away from the door.
Children!
Daddy! Daddy! Daddy!
Let me down!
Ow!
My Liebchen, are you hurt?
My back is broken.
We must escape through the cellars.
Very well. Come on.
Come on!
Daddy, look at the children.
You stay here.
JEMIMA: Daddy!
What are you doing?
Where are all these children coming from?
I thought we had passed a law against children.
Quick. This way.
Where are we going?
Quickly. We'll go down here.
(GASPS) No, no.
I'll get my clothes dirty.
Don't argue.
Oh, my crown.
I lost my crown.
Oh, never mind, my little pumpkin.
Here.
Attack!
No! Daddy!
Look! There's Chitty!
Chitty's come to save us!
Hooray!
Hello, a motorcar.
What's that doing here?
There's Grandpa.
Grandpa!
Caractacus! My boy!
Are you all right?
Oh!
Stand back from the propellers.
Keep clear.
Bye!
Bye! Bye!
Bye! Bye!
CARACTACUS: And so, after that, Vulgaria became a free country, and all the children laughed and played in the sunshine, and they were very, very happy.
And Chitty flew high over the mountains back to England, everybody safe and sound.
And Daddy and Truly were married.
And lived happily ever after.
Yes.
Is that how the story ends?
It's getting late.
We better get back.
Well. . .
Goodbye, Jeremy.
Goodbye, Jemima.
Goodbye, Truly.
Will we see you again?
Oh, I expect so.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Truly.
I'm sorry about the children.
I hope they didn't embarrass you.
In what way?
Why, that silly joke about us getting married.
Well, you know what kids are like.
Yes, I understand.
I mean, I don't think they realize how ridiculous that would be.
Ridiculous?
Well, yes.
You live in that big house, your father, the factory and all.
It's a different world, Truly.
You know, if I said something like that, you'd call me a snob.
I didn't mean. . .
Goodbye.
Well, don't you want to ride up front?
Well, that was a fine picnic, wasn't it?
Shall we have another one tomorrow?
With Truly?
Yes.
Well, Miss Scrumptious has a lot of social engagements, you know.
Are we ever going to see Truly again, Daddy?
Well, we'll see.
JEREMY: Look, that's Lord Scrumptious' car.
CARACTACUS:
Why, I believe it is.
JEMIMA: I wonder what it's doing here.
CARACTACUS:
Well, I don't know.
Come on.
Excuse me.
Good afternoon.
Are you. . .
Boom! Boom! Boom!
That's wiped out your dashed cavalry.
Yes, sir.
But I have my 2nd
Infantry battalion attacking here from the rear.
Attacking from the rear?
That's dashed unethical.
Artillery, prepare to open fire.
Fire!
GRANDPA: Number one battalion, prepare to advance!
What's going on here?
There you are, young Potts.
Been waiting for you.
And that wiped out your artillery!
You're a cad, Potts.
Would someone mind telling me what's going on?
Fancy you being old Bungie's son.
Bungie?
Bungie Potts, best batman I ever had.
Weren't you, Potts?
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.
You mean that you were. . .
My boy.
Allow me to introduce to you my Brigadier.
Your Brigadier?
Potts. . .
How about some more tea?
Yes, sir. Right away, sir.
As for you, young man, there's a very good chance you may be very rich.
CARACTACUS: Very rich?
What do you mean?
Those confounded sweets of yours.
Useless for humans, wonderful for dogs.
Woof Sweets, that's what we'll call them.
Woof Sweets?
Canine candies.
Dogs love them.
Make a fortune.
Daddy, Daddy!
You've done it, Daddy.
You've done it!
Have l?
It's the posh life for us all now, my boy.
We're all going to be rich!
Hooray!
Do you mean to tell me
I invented something that actually works?
Of course they do.
Wouldn't be offering you a contract unless they did.
Sign here, please.
Wait. Don't go away.
I'll be right back.
LORD SCRUMPTlOUS:
What about the contract?
But, Daddy, where are you going?
Daddy!
What's the matter with the fellow?
Well, he's a bit of an eccentric, sir, a genius, of course, but definitely an eccentric.
Can't imagine where he gets it from.
Truly, you'll never believe it.
I just got home. . .
This is beginning to be. . .
. . .and your father was at my house.
. . .a hazard.
I know! I know!
They told me at the house.
We're rich.
You know, more than that,
I have succeeded.
I always knew you would.
You know something else?
The kids were right.
There's nothing so ridiculous about the idea of getting married.
Well, whoever said there was?
Well, Mr. Potts.
What's the matter?
Now you'll have to marry me.
So dreams can come true.
Yes, they can.
Yes, they can, but you have to be practical, too.
You have to face the facts.
Man has to see things as they really are.
After all, a man with responsibilities can't walk around with his head in the clouds all the time.
A man should keep his feet solidly on the ground.
Oh, a man should have his dreams but a man has to learn to put those dreams to some practical use, not just sit around and think about them all the time.
BOTH: (SINGING) Oh, you, pretty Chitty Bang Bang
Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, we love you
And our pretty
Chitty Bang Bang
Chitty Chitty Bang Bang loves us too
High, low, anywhere we go
On Chitty Chitty we depend

Our fine four-fendered friend
CARACTACUS:
It's uncategorical
A fuel-burning oracle
A phantasmagorical machine
TRULY: It's more than spectacular
To use the vernacular
It's wizard
It's smashing
BOTH: It's keen
Oh, Chitty, you Chitty
Pretty Chitty Bang Bang
Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, we love you
And Chitty, in Chitty

ENGLlSH - US - PSDH
The legend of Jack the Giant Killer was born more than a thousand years ago in Cornwall, England near Land's End.
There was a time when the kingdom of Cornwall lived in fear and trembling of the black prince
Pendragon, master of all witches, giants, and hobgoblins who ravaged the land.
But at long last, Herla the wizard drove Pendragon and all his witches from the kingdom and exiled them beyond the reaches of the known world.
Here, on a misty isle uncharted and unknown
Pendragon schemed and waited for the day when he would return to power in Cornwall.
Then, after many years, the day came.
It was a day of great rejoicing in Cornwall and kings and princes bearing gifts came to celebrate a special occasion.
Know then, Princess
Elaine that as you are by the grace of God the only child of our noble king therefore I now place upon your head this ancient coronet of the house of Cornwall.
May you wear it in honor as befits our future queen.
Rise, Elaine.
Trumpeters, proclaim the festivities.
Let the bells ring.
Health and happiness to the princess Elaine.
May she live to be a hundred years.
For the great Elaine's birthday.
Come on, move aside.
For your country.
As the people of Cornwall celebrated, Pendragon arrived.
Make way.
And now the presentation of gifts.
His Highness Vallons, Duke of Normandy.
His Excellency, the prince of Tarquin Isle Elidorus.
It is exquisite, King Meliodas.
Elidorus?
Know you this prince, Chancellor?
Never have I heard the name yet there's something faintly familiar if I can but recall.
Your most gracious majesty King Mark.
I apologize for the lateness of my arrival.
Prince Elidorus?
I cannot seem to remember.
When was it that we met?
We never have, Your Majesty.
Yet you honor my daughter's birthday?
I have always admired the crown of Cornwall.
Therefore I took the liberty of bringing
Her Royal Highness a small, but unique gift.
If you please, Garna.
Certainly, master.
Thank you, Prince.
May I see what's inside?
- Allow me, Princess.
A music box.
He walks.
Why, he could almost be alive.
A nation merchant of whom I acquired him spoke of a curious talent.
Look, Father, what an unusual gift.
I believe he wishes this dance.
Certainly, my cavalier.
Oh, you were wonderful.
What an enchanting gift, Prince Elidorus.
Enter.
More gifts.
Bring them over here.
Put them on the table.
Careful, now.
You were lovely today, Princess.
Your father was proud of you.
I think my father is slightly prejudiced.
It was nice to be remembered by so many people.
One day, it'll be a crown you'll be wearing, the queen of a mighty kingdom.
My father still has many good years ahead of him.
I don't like to think about that day.
Of course not.
When you're young, it's only today that counts.
Into bed with you.
Good night, Princess.
Sleep well, Lady Constance.
A pity to shatter your innocent dreams, Princess Elaine, but the throne of Cornwall is to be mine and only you can give it to me.
Garna, quickly.
Cormoran will meet you at the place appointed.
Be assured, Master, all will be as you wish.
No, no!
No!
- Princess.
It's the princess.
Something's happened to the princess.
Guards, guards.
The princess.
No!
No!
My daughter.
Elaine.
Elaine!
Make room.
Break it down.
Elaine, Elaine!
Elaine!
Your Majesty, Your Majesty.
A giant is running off with the princess.
Alarm, sound the alarm.
Guards, guards, stop him.
Stop him, men!
Lower the gates!
Drop the portcullis.
Get him.
Repair the bridge, men.
Axes and poles.
Guards, lend a hand.
We can't let him out of our sight.
It's been years since giants were banished.
Why would they return now?
Why?
Come on, Jonathan, Tom.
It's a beautiful day.
Whoa, oh.
OK, Tom, come on, back.
Back, back.
Oh.
Come on, Tom.
Come on, oh.
What's the matter with you two this morning?
We have to get that feed to town whether you like it or not.
Now come on, no more nonsense, back.
What's going on around here?
Well done, Cormoran.
Leaving so soon, Princess?
Why, your voyage has just begun.
No, no, no.
Let me go, please, help.
Who's to hear you, Princess?
- Please.
- Now quiet.
Please let me go.
The master has planned a nice long voyage for you...
- Please.
- In honor of your birthday.
Don't.
Cormoran!
Look out!
Cormoran!
Cormoran!
Cormoran!
Cormoran!
Cormoran!
Cormoran!
Cormoran, after them!
Head them off.
Bring them back.
Quick, the loft.
Look out, run!
Are you all right?
You've done it.
You killed him.
It was nothing.
I kill a giant every morning before breakfast.
Starts my day right.
I think you'd better put this on.
You, farmer.
Have you seen the princess?
Your Majesty.
Kneel, girl, it's the king.
The princess, Your Majesty?
Elaine.
Young man be good enough to come down from there with my daughter.
Oh, I'm sorry, Princess.
I didn't know.
Well, young man?
We mustn't keep the king waiting.
- Elaine.
- Father.
The Lord has been merciful.
Oh, father, this is the young man who so bravely rescued me from the giant.
- Rise, my boy.
- Jack, Jack.
Oh, Jack.
You're safe.
When I saw that horrible monster...
Mother, this is the king.
Your Majesty.
Rise, madame.
Forgive me, I was so thankful to see my son alive.
I'm so thankful to see my daughter alive.
Oh, poor child, I have some hot porridge on the fire.
She'll need warmth and rest before she returns to the castle.
You've done a most remarkable deed, young man.
Thank you, Your Majesty.
I'm proud to serve the king as my father did.
Your father served the crown?
Yes, in the royal archers.
He fell at the Battle of Land's End.
A noble battle then, a noble battle now.
Your father would have been proud of you this day.
Come, let's have a look at your giant.
Hideous creature.
The boat.
The strange boat that was taking the princess away.
Hurry, Your Majesty.
But it was...
There it is the small black craft.
And there was a strange, dwarf-like man, Your Majesty.
- The servant, Garna.
- You know him, Sire?
I know him and his master.
Master.
Master.
Master Pendragon.
What happened?
Calamity, O Prince.
Most fateful disaster.
The princess where is she?
Cormoran is dead, slain by a young farmer.
By now the princess is back in her father's castle.
Impossible, you're lying.
I tell the truth, Master.
I swear it.
He took her from me at the boat and then killed the giant.
I saw it with my own eyes.
Blundering fool.
A fury take you to your torment all of you.
I scheme a thousand nights put the princess in your very hands.
And you, imbecile, idiot allow a mere farmer, a mortal, to defy me.
We have failed, Master.
We have failed.
But only for a moment.
I shall have the princess, and the farmer shall die.
By all the powers of darkness, he shall die.
For returning to us the princess alive and well as by a miracle and so delivering us from the ravages of our enemies we dub thee Sir Jack protector of the realm.
Rise, Sir Jack.
May you serve this court with honor as did your father before you.
- So be it.
- Amen.
Your Majesty.
Your Majesty.
- What is it, Chancellor?
We must talk privately at once.
- Can't it wait?
- This is very important.
Very well.
Attend Sir Jack, daughter.
I'll return presently.
Congratulations upon your knighthood, Sir Jack.
- I'm so proud of you, Jack.
- Sir Jack now.
I'm honored to shake your hand, Sir Jack.
At long last, a hero in the court who is young.
And handsome.
It's a bit warm here.
Would you mind seeing me to the terrace, Sir Jack?
Certainly, Princess.
Thank you for rescuing me.
You saved my life once, remember?
Hail to Sir Jack1
To Jack the Giant Killer.
Hail, Sir Jack, hail, Sir Jack.
I think my rescuer has acquired a new name.
I seem to have acquired more than a new name.
It's a great honor.
I only hope I can be worthy of it.
That's my father's way of thanking you.
This is mine.
I shall immediately go out and find another giant to slay.
Before breakfast?
Know also that these ageless giants with horns and satyr-like features who roam our Cornwall countryside destroy and plunder at the bidding of their master, Pendragon.
These records were lost among the archives of your father's reign.
I've only just uncovered them.
Then this Prince Elidorus is really Pendragon in disguise.
The prince of witches.
But why would he want to seize the princess?
Why?
If we knew that, we'd know what to do.
There's only one thing we can do.
We were fortunate this time, but Pendragon is certain to make another attempt.
I'm going to entrust you with the most important mission ever given to a Cornish knight to protect the life of the princess until she's safe.
I will certainly try to be worthy of your trust, Sire, but is one guard enough?
Our only defense is secrecy.
There aren't enough men in all Cornwall to protect the life of the princess should her whereabouts become known to Pendragon.
At dawn, you and Elaine, disguised as peasants will travel to a convent in Normandy.
When the princess is safely within its walls you will return here.
That means I'm to live in exile.
It won't be easy, Father.
Believe me, Elaine, it's the only way.
Very well, Father.
I'm ready to do whatever's best.
Go now.
Prepare yourself for the journey.
Good night, Father.
Good night, my dear.
We have plans to make and the dawn comes much too soon.
You'd better go now.
It's getting late.
Is there anything more I can do for you, mistress?
No, nothing more, Lady Constance.
I shall miss you.
And I shall pray for your safe journey.
We'll send word as soon as it's safe to return to Cornwall.
Take care of her, Jack.
No one will harm her while I live, Your Majesty.
Quiet, Gaunt, quiet.
We have a mission for you at last a most interesting mission.
Patience, patience.
Patience.
Fly straight and true, Gaunt.
Our master will be most eager for your message.
Master.
Master, Black Prince.
Look, it has come from the castle.
So you finally decided to visit us, eh, Gaunt?
Bringing a little present.
She sails with the morning tide.
What kind of a voyage is it to be, eh, Tubo?
Smooth and tranquil?
All right, lads, bear a hand on that halyard.
You, man, lay a hand there.
Heave.
Heave.
Lay your backs into it, lads.
Heave.
Heave.
Heave.
How goes it, Captain?
Fair skies and a sparkling breeze.
No man could ask for better.
I haven't seen miss Elaine since mid-morn.
Nor I.
She's not in her cabin.
Probably with the helmsman.
Come on, mind the wheel, Jack.
Peter!
Aye, Father.
Have you seen our lady passenger?
Aye, she's here with me.
Well, come up and lend a hand, lad.
We've got a landfall to make.
Aye, Captain.
He's a fine lad, your son.
That he is and smart as paint.
And he can haul a jib as proper as any man aboard.
Here you are, son.
Take over the helm.
I'll get a bite to eat.
Jack, you can give Miss Elaine her first glance at the continent.
Thank you, Captain.
Oh, you can see much better from up there, off the larboard.
Helmsman, keep her teeth in the wind.
Aye, Captain.
I didn't realize we were so close to shore.
This makes it even closer.
Do you want to look?
It's already too close.
Soon I'll be in the convent, and you'll be going back.
I'll be alone.
The sisters will take good care of you.
It's been such a wonderful voyage just the two of us.
I wish I didn't have to go into hiding that I could stay as a make-believe peasant girl.
I wish I were a genie to make your wish come true.
Suppose you were?
What would you do?
I would turn myself into a great prince and I would search every farm and village of England until I found you.
Then I would hold you and tell you that I love you.
And I would answer that I love you.
But it wouldn't be make-believe,
Jack, because it's true.
And then we'd fly away on my magic carpet and live happily together forever after.
Jack.
All right, lads, heave.
Heave.
- Ho.
- Heave.
- Ho.
All right, lay your backs to it, lads.
Heave.
- Ho.
Pipe the captain.
All hands lay to.
What happened?
Captain!
Rocks, Captain.
We've run aground.
- Mid-channel?
There are no rocks here.
- All hands lay to.
- Are you all right, lad?
- Aye.
- What did we hit?
I don't know, look at the sky.
It's turning dark.
- And we've stopped moving.
- It's unnatural.
Captain, look aloft.
Witches.
Who is it, Captain?
This voyage is accursed.
- It's the work of the devil.
- It's the devil himself.
Devil or witch or whatever you are, you may have the wind on me now, but you'll not scuttle my ship.
Witches.
We're doomed.
- Run for you lives.
- Witches, witches.
Witches.
Come with me.
Peter, up here.
- Witches.
Father, here.
Lock the door and let no one in.
- Witches.
- Witches, witches.
Witches.
A witch.
Captain, Captain.
More witches on the quarter deck.
Witches.
Sail across my bow, will you?
Father.
Father.
Jack.
Jack, Jack!
Jack!
Jack!
Look.
Jack.
Jack, Jack!
No.
No.
No.
No!
No!
Elaine!
The witches, they're going.
Father!
- We're moving.
- Look, it's getting light.
Captain.
Let's head for home.
They mustn't turn back the ship.
Captain.
Back to England it is, lads.
Make ready to come about.
Bosun, I'm taking command of this ship.
Oh, you are?
You hear that, lads?
Our passenger's taking command of the ship.
- In His Majesty's name.
- In His Majesty's name.
And where would our Royal
Highness wish us to sail him?
We're going to save the girl.
His Majesty can have this blasted tub as soon as we're safe ashore at Cornwall.
As for me, I'll not sail in the wake of those accursed witches.
Turn to, we're going go.
Listen, you men.
Sail to England and you'll all swing from the gallows.
Elaine is the royal princess of Cornwall.
Aye, and I'm the caliph of Baghdad.
Well, then, throw him overboard.
Over the side.
Over the side.
I'll get you.
Jack, Jack!
Jack!
O Isis, keeper of the magic flame, behold thy shrouded minions, demons of the dark assembled to prepare before the altar of thy eternal flame a neophyte to serve thee in thy mystic labyrinth.
Behold O Isis the eye of ancient Egypt.
Awake, Princess of Cornwall.
Open thine eyes.
Gaze deep within the sacred orb of egypt.
Bathe your innermost soul in the magic flame.
Now let the blood in your veins intermingle with the blood of the ancient spirits of the dark nether world.
Behold yourself in the mirror.
Now are you one of the mystic coven of witches.
The court of His Exalted Majesty
King Mark of Cornwall is now in session.
Let the stranger approach the throne.
Pendragon.
You dare to come here?
Guards!
I detect a chill in your hospitality, but perhaps Your Majesty does not wish to hear of the whereabouts of the royal princess?
He couldn't possibly know about Elaine.
Approach the throne.
Thank you, Your Majesty.
Speak forth, Black Prince.
I merely wish to inform Your Majesty that your daughter did not reach the convent as you planned.
What have you done with her?
Where is she?
Only I know that.
I don't believe you.
You're lying.
Do you think so?
Behold.
Elaine.
Elaine.
Do you really think I am so stupid as to bring the girl herself?
That illusion was merely to prove to you that I have her in reality.
My daughter is she safe?
Perfectly, at my castle.
What is it that you want of me?
My terms are simple.
Merely that you abdicate within a week.
You may take your chancellor and any aides that you require and leave
England, never to return.
But who will rule my country, govern my people?
You?
On the contrary.
The next in legal succession will ascend the throne.
Her coronation will take place immediately after your abdication.
You mean my daughter will become queen?
You see?
My terms are generous, are they not?
With you by her side to advise her?
That may be as may be.
You have one choice to make, King Mark.
Your daughter or your throne.
In a week, I shall return for your answer.
You hold my daughter, witch, but we hold you!
Seize him.
One week, King Mark no more.
How could he have known of our plans?
Outside of the two of us?
Lady Constance!
Except for the princess and Jack only we three knew we were sending Elaine away.
Surely, you don't think it was I?
Look into that mirror.
No, no.
According to legend, if you're a witch the mirror will reflect your true soul.
All right, it was I who told the master.
Break the mirror.
Break the spell.
Oh.
Oh, forgive me.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Forgive me, forgive me.
We do not blame you, Constance.
- Forgive me.
- We pity you.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Ahoy on board!
Help!
Ahoy!
Help!
Strange fish in the sea today.
Ah.
Here, drink.
All of it.
It's good, Sigurd, after it's down.
We were trying to remember if you'd ever seen these witches.
Oh, the witches.
Yeah.
Ah, I sailed these waters under Eric the Red.
Sailed in 50 ships, we did, to conquer Ireland.
Oh, it was wonderful the fighting, the plundering.
Yes, but did you ever see the witches?
Oh, the witches, the witches.
These old eyes have seen many strange sights.
Once when Eric the Red and I were sailing south we saw a school of dragons in the sea.
Yes, but these witches were in the sky and their leader had three horns on his head.
And he carried a pitchfork.
- A pitchfork?
- That shot blue flames.
Blue flames?
Sounds like
Tubo the warlock to me,
Pendragor's witch from across the sea.
Yeah?
What was that?
The imp of the bottle.
I fished him up in my nets one day.
He claims to have great powers, but he will do nothing for me.
Have a care.
Just a moment.
You ugly mean devil.
Couldn't you wait?
I asked for nothing.
And nothing you'll get, you murderous Viking.
Me power's reserved for one to me liking.
A little toy man.
Insulting a leprechaun.
A toy, you say?
Oh, for that there'll be the devil to pay.
Now hush up and listen.
Jack here is a good and true lad with with a just cause.
There's a princess to be rescued from the witches and I need help.
A noble aim, if spoken true.
Pick up the bottle I dare you to.
A caution if you've told a lie the glass will glow, and your hand will fry.
Faith, and after a thousand years at last an honest man appears.
Have you been in there that long?
He was imprisoned by the king of elves for dabbling in the black arts.
I'd finished me work, me shoes heeled and sewn.
All I did was to make me these boots out of gold.
Not just boots, seven-league boots.
Made out of the old pot of gold, you baboon to go around the world and over the moon.
You'll help me, then?
These magic coins will aid your mission if you'll agree to one condition.
When they're gone, there are only three you'll smash the glass and set me free.
It's a bargain, then.
♪ For his island we'll sail to twist Pendragor's tail ♪
♪ And the princess we'll save from that horrible knave ♪
♪ I'm off on a fling, I'll get out of this thing ♪
♪ A free man I'll be, oh, tralura tralee ♪
At least we're here, thanks to the imp.
Now to find out where he's hiding Elaine.
You think it wise for you to go alone?
I think there's less chance of being discovered.
Suppose you're caught, Jack?
We'll see if our little friend here is as good as he says he is.
Who led you safely across the brine?
You do your part, I'll do mine.
Ah.
I'd put my trust in that sword.
We'll see.
Remember to put some fresh water aboard.
Be careful, Jack.
Good luck.
We don't often have visitors.
A clever lad.
How would he fair, do you suppose against our castle's defenses?
It would be a most diverting spectacle to see.
You cannot fight these men with stone.
Look about you, seize a bone.
A bone, to fight them?
A bone to fight their magic might.
A bone to get a fairer fight.
Don't be asking questions, dunce.
Seize the bone now, at once.
Thanks, imp.
Thank me later, on the ship.
Right now, get cracking with that whip.
A magic whip.
This alters things.
He must be dealt with differently.
Enter, lad, enter.
Don't look back in that direction.
I'll take care of your protection.
Welcome to castle Pendragon.
I had a sample of your welcome outside.
I must compliment you on your valor, young man.
First you vanquished Cormoran, my giant.
Then you found your way to this island, a feat in itself.
And just now you lashed at and destroyed my dragon men with your magic whip, a stroke of genius.
A real tragedy to have come so far only to suffer failure.
You're so sure I have failed?
I am, indeed.
For you see, if you take one step toward me horns will sprout from your head.
A second step, and you will develop cloven hooves and walk on all fours.
A third step and the transformation will be complete.
You will have become a black ram.
So, you see?
Your sword can be an antidote to give you a cashmere coat.
Hold it 'fore you as you go, hilt above and point below.
No horns.
No hooves.
No wool.
Defeated, did you say, witch?
Please, let us dispense with theatricalities.
My powers are obviously completely without effect against your own.
Therefore, I yield to the inevitable.
I'm curious, how do you acquire such potent forces?
The princess.
- She is not here.
- Produce her, or die.
- She's not in the castle.
- Then where?
On the other side of the island there are the ruins of a little Roman temple.
She is imprisoned there.
Have her brought to me at once.
If you wish to free the princess you must go there.
How do I know I can trust you?
Aren't we rather forced to trust each other?
There seems no other way.
Very well.
But make no attempt to trick me.
Master, your magic what's happened?
Princess.
Out of my way, you yelping dogs, and let me think.
Never have I failed to turn a mere mortal into a cringing beast.
But he was able to withstand the strength of my magic.
It was the sword, Master.
The burning sword.
It was not only the sword, you fool.
Have you forgotten the magic whip?
He has a strange power, perhaps some ancient talisman of the black arts.
We must find the secret of this power.
Perhaps I can help.
He doesn't know I'm one of you.
Perhaps you can.
Garna.
- Yes, Master?
Take her to the ruined temple.
Yes, Master.
There you will appear to him as the princess Elaine.
- Princess, it's all right.
- Jack.
You're safe now.
Dear Jack, I prayed you'd come.
I have a boat on the beach waiting to take us back to England.
Can you walk?
I'll be all right.
Ahoy, Sigurd, Peter.
The cask is gone.
They must still be looking for water.
Well, they'll be returning soon.
I'd better make ready to sail.
I never thought I'd see you again, Jack or that I'd ever leave this island alive.
We had the luck of the Irish on our side.
Surely it would take more than luck to defeat Pendragon.
Luck and the secret of my magic weapon.
- You mean this?
- The sword?
No.
That's just Sigurd's rusty old blade.
I was talking about my friend, the imp of the bottle.
He's a leprechaun, imprisoned in the bottle by a magic spell.
We both owe him everything.
Oh, such pretty words you'd better stay till we are safe and far away.
Is there something wrong, Princess?
I guess being chained out there for so long I'm cold.
We can wait in the cabin.
This'll warm you.
Is there anything, some hot tea to drink?
Well, this brew of
Sigurd's isn't exactly fit for a princess but it is warming.
I'll pour it.
Get another cup, Jack.
We'll drink together to our escape from this island.
That I will gladly do.
I wish Peter were here to celebrate with us.
Yes, and Sigurd, too.
You'll like him.
Thank you, Princess.
To a safe voyage home.
And to us.
To a happy future.
You and I together, Jack, for the rest of our lives.
To us.
To us.
All right, to us.
Oh, it's strange to feel happy at a time like this, but when we set...
What's the matter, Jack?
I don't know.
Suddenly I feel strange, as if I were going to...
Fresh air.
She must be evil, the bottle's hot.
She pretends to be what she is not.
Watch it there!
Don't rock the ship.
Saints preserve us, I'm going to slip!
Ahoy on board.
Sigurd!
Jack, Jack.
Sigurd, come here, quick.
Your imp stands between me and the throne of Cornwall.
Where is he?
You have great magic powers.
Find him yourself.
Yes, I will.
Only twice in my existence have I been thwarted, once by Herla the wizard and this second time by you.
Herla is dead.
Yes, and I will die, too, rather than betray my king.
I shall hope to make you change your mind.
Garna.
- Yes, Master?
Peter, Sigurd.
For the last time, where is the imp?
Release the Viking.
I am afraid you were not sufficiently impressed on your first visit.
I'll give you a new demonstration of my powers.
Sigurd.
Now the boy.
Look at me.
Stop it.
Jack!
Peter!
Wait.
Jack, tell him, please.
I can't.
Look at me.
Peter, Peter!
And now, my dear, you are next.
What do you suppose would be most fitting?
A serpent?
Or perhaps a toad?
Or would you prefer to tell me where you have hid the imp?
Your loyalty to your king is touching, but your allegiance to the princess is another matter.
You have...
You have until these sands run out to convince your knight that he is being most unwise.
Garna.
I advise you, consider carefully.
Please, Jack, tell him where you hid the imp.
You've got to to save us all.
Is that why you drugged me, to get the imp?
I did it to save your life.
He threatened to kill you if I refused.
He was watching every move.
He'll kill you now if you don't tell him where you hid the imp.
Then I'll have to die because I don't know where the imp is.
You really don't know?
It's the truth, Princess.
I don't know.
You were a fool to come here, Jack.
Your fate was sealed the moment you set foot on this island.
The only thing that kept you alive was the imp.
As soon as the master returns, you die, all of you.
Princess, you are bewitched.
Break the mirror before it's too late.
Break the spell he cast over you.
Untie me!
Help me before it's too late.
And what would you save me from,
Prince Charming, my reflection?
Look at me.
Gaze upon my true self.
Am I not beautiful?
Why be the princess of Cornwall when I can be queen of all England?
Think of it.
How exciting.
A witch on the throne of England.
I forgot.
Pity you won't be there.
Peter, Peter.
That's right.
Come over here and untie me.
Over here, untie me quickly.
No!
No!
No!
Get away from there.
Get back in your cage.
Please, let him be.
Master!
Pendragon, help!
Help me, Pendragon.
Master.
Help me!
Help.
Master, no, no.
No, Master.
No, please.
No!
- Sorry, Princess.
Master!
Forgive me.
Forgive me.
Garna, quickly.
Pendragon.
Master, the cage it's empty, too.
This would explain it.
Flaming gauntlets live.
Fight.
Wait.
There's a secret passage out of the castle this way.
Hurry.
No matter.
They cannot reach the boat.
Jack, Jack, come back!
The boat is just beyond those rocks.
Run for the rocks!
It's a matter of a few moments now.
At least we're safe in here.
Not at high tide.
Ahoy there, you, whoever you be, get me out of this boiling sea!
The imp.
Peter, give it to me, quick.
Hurry, imp, your last good deed.
Do it now.
- Please, hurry.
Beware of her.
She'll change your features like she did those other creatures.
She was under Pendragor's spell, but it's broken now.
Hurry, your magic.
In all the kingdom under the sea there's just one creature might set you free.
Well, throw the coin.
Call him.
Master, they're making for the boat.
Out of my way.
Master, they're escaping.
Give me room.
Can't you help us, just once more?
Oh, I would if I could, but you've had your three.
Look at me purse.
It is empty, see?
No, Jack!
Jack!
Jack, help!
Jack, Jack.
Help!
Jack!
Jack.
Jack.
Peter.
Sigurd.
How wonderful.
- Jack, come on.
- Come on.
Come on.
- Come on.
- Come on.
Sigurd.
Ah, Peter, you're restored, too.
When you killed Pendragon, it broke the spell over us.
And look at his castle.
Destroyed forever.
You'll find dry clothes in the cabin.
Just a minute.
I have a promise to fulfill.
You got a hammer?
Here, see?
Be careful, don't hurt him.
Will you be still and calm your fears?
I've been waiting 10 hundred years.
Now, watch the glass.
Just a minute.
Have a care.
The bottle turn it, give me air.
- Sorry, I was only...
- Never mind the lame excuse.
Break the glass and then let me loose.
Little imp, you're free.
Free at last, to breathe and bend thanks to you, me noble friend.
For you, Elaine, some sound advice.
Opportunity knocks, but never twice.
So if it's happiness you'd woo marry Jack.
He's the lad for you.
I intend to.
The little people are waiting for me in Ireland there, across the sea.
Ah, it is a beautiful place, the fairest of fair and me seven-league boots will get me there.
So bless you all and have no fear.
Your course for home will soon be clear.
He's gone.
What did he mean about our course?
Look, over there, in the sky.
If your homeward way you'd wend follow the rainbow to its end.
- Goodbye, imp.
- Goodbye, imp.
- Good luck.
- He was a loyal friend.
I'll miss him.
Come boy, we must get on our course.
She doesn't answer to the helm very well.
Oh, she will do to get us back to England.
To England and home.
Bertha!
Bertha!
- Essie?
- Uh-huh.
- I'll be right there.
- Uh-huh.
If you weren't on your diet you could help yourself to some candy.
One thing you can say about me, when it comes to candy, I got no self control.
So you'll be a bathing beauty a day later.
Here's the ice you wanted!
- Stunning!
My son gave it to me for Christmas.
It's from B. Altman's!
It's a very practical present.
I'll empty it and give it back.
No no, lend it.
It'll make an impression.
On my daughter and son-in-law I need to make an impression?
Mind if I have a king size with a hint of mint?
Every day you change your brand.
I've been experimenting with filter tips.
The best filter tip is - don't smoke.
Got the monkey on my back.
- Essie.
- Hm?
Why are you sitting around?
I thought you had a heavy date? 
What I always say is, keep 'em waiting.
Don't wait. It's later than you think.
That must be the kids.
Come in, come in, come in.
- Hello Alice.
- Hello Mama.
- Jerry!
- Hello mama, how are you? 
- Alice, Alice ...
- Oh, Mama!
Mama, let me look at you.
My goodness, you look young as ever.
- What's your secret?
- The same. Hot water with lemon.
- You look tired a little tired, Alice.
- Oh I won't after I've had a bath.
Let me fill my eyes with you, Jerry.
Oh, Mama...
- Come on, let me ...
- Beginning tomorrow...
I'm going on a diet of hot water with lemon.
- Hello Alice!
- Oh, hello, Mrs. Rubin.
Jerry, you know Mrs. Rubin.
- Certainly, it's nice to see you again, Mrs. Rubin.
Likewise.
How was your trip from Washington?
-We ran into a little headwind it was kind of bumpy.
- You flew?
-Yes, mama, but we didn't want to tell you.
I'm glad I didn't know.
How are your folks, Jerry?
Booming! We're taking you there for dinner tomorrow night.
We'll see...
Take a drink darling.
And take some ice from Essie's beautiful ice bucket she lent me.
It's nice to have such thoughtful neighbors.
Maybe she wouldn't have for long.
Essie is thinking of moving out of Brooklyn.
Manhattan.
An apartment hotel
It costs a little more, but my son says it's worth it ... to get into a decent neighborhood again.
What's the matter with this neighborhood, Mrs. Ruben?
Take a walk around Nostrand Avenue and you'll see.
That element is moving in.
The place is full of them.
What element, Mrs. Rubin?
You know what I have reference to, colored, also Puerto Ricans...
Really?
I seem to remember that in this very neighborhood years ago they didn't allow Jews.
Well what has one got to do with the other?
- Everything.
Mrs. Rubin, the only way to stop prejudice ... is to stop it in yourself.
But honestly it's not a question of prejudice!
I just don't like to live with them!
But that's the point. You see, Mrs. Rubin, you don't like to live with--
Why don't you take the bags in the bedroom, Jerry?
I emptied out half a closet and the two top drawers in the dresser.
- Alright, mama. I'll get a quick shave.
- Then we'll eat.
It was nice talking to you Mrs. Rubin.
- Likewise.
Your husband is certainly very argumentative.
On that subject, yes indeed. And so am I.
Darling, how would you like something to eat or drink?
If you've got some, I'm dying for a glass of black cherry soda.
Don't die so fast. I've got it.
And you, Essie?
- Is it diet tonic?
If you want diet tonic, drink water.
Diet tonic...
You going somewheres again, like Costa Rica or south of the border down Mexico way?
If that's where our tour of duty will take us.
Your mother would like it better if you stayed here, believe me.
Isn't there any chance for Jerry to get a job in this country?
When you're in the foreign service, Mrs. Rubin, you take orders like everyone else.
- Oh, I see.
- Alice!
- Yes?
- You forgot to put my shaving cream in!
Alice!
Jerry needs extra shaving cream, there's some in the medicine chest.
Also razor blades.
I can't find them!
Excuse me, Mrs. Rubin.
Even if it's right in front of their noses, they can't see a thing.
If the corner drugstore ever runs out of stock, all they've gotta do is call mama, she's loaded.
She's just prepared for any emergency.
How is it possible you couldn't find this.
Oh.
Is Mrs. Rubin still here?
- Uh-huh.
Well ease her out gently, I'll take my time shaving and you can sit down... and tell your mother all about our plans.
No I won't, you coward.
I'm going to need you for moral support.
Well Alice in my feeble judgment it's much better if you tell her alone.
Tell her what, Jerry?
That we're going to take her along?
Now Alice, you know that's impossible.
Well if it's so impossible then you're going to face it with me.
Now hurry up.
Oh and this time try to get that little spot under your left nostril.
- Here we are, darling.
- Thank you.
That was very thoughtful of you, Mama.
- I hardly knew what to get.
Papa used to use a shaving stick and David used an electric razor.
And now, shaving cream is in a can like whipped cream.
You want, Essie? I have plenty.
- Oh, no, thank you.
I'm saving up my appetite for a martini.
I've really gotta get on my bicycle.
Oh um ... please thank your husband for a very stimulating conversation.
Bye!
- Bye, Mrs. Rubin.
- Bye, Bertha.
- Bye, Essie. Eat good.
- Uh-huh!
So, Essie isn't here, now we can talk.
You got something to tell me, Alice?
Yes, Mama. But I want Jerry to be here with me when I do.
Maybe Jerry doesn't need to be here. 
Maybe your mama is a fortune teller.
January? December?
I'm going to be a grandmother, yes, Alice?
No, Mama.
"Did you go to see the doctor?"
- Yes mama. It's all right.
- You don't need an operation?
- No!
He gave me a series of exercises.
Exercises? That's the new way?
And lots of pills.
What you need is lots of rest.
You should talk, Mama. You're the one who should take it easy.
Why did you take that job?
A part time job, a couple of days a week.
Part time or full time ... you still have to travel on the subway and stand on your feet all day.
You know I worry about you.
I like to keep busy.
Besides it takes the little financial burden off you and that makes me feel good.
Mama, don't say that. If I worked all my life I could never--
Shhh!
Alice, you don't mind if I ask you something?
Do you know what was last Thursday?
Yes mama. It was the anniversary of David's death.
I didn't forget.
And you lighted a yahrzeit candle?
Remember the day he was drafted and we took him to the subway train?
You know what I forgot?
The napkins.
For supper I'm giving Jerry just what he likes.
Pot roast. Not greasy. I know he doesn't like grease.
- Potato kugel.
- Wonderful.
Peas and carrots.
And with my economy lemon ice-box cake
I'm giving Jerry cream with his coffee.
Cream? After meat, mama?
I've been watching the television commercials and I've gotta live modern.
Oh Jerry doesn't really mind.
I know Jerry likes cream with his coffee.
His family never kept kosher.
Sometimes I wonder why I keep up all the dietary laws.
But I think I know the answer.
Remember papa's joke?
I'm glad I don't like spinach ... because if I liked it I'd eat it and I hate it.
Well that's me.
So tell me Jerry's news already.
All I can tell you is that Jerry got a big promotion.
Leave it to Jerry. Like papa always said, he'll be an ambassador someday.
By papa he was already an ambassador.
I can just see papa with his pinochle friends saying...
'My son the ambassador is now in France.'
Your papa was some liar when it came to Jerry.
Oh Mama...
So you know what you need?
You go wash your face and comb your hair and put on a little more lipstick.
- I like that color. What is it?
'Heavenly Persian Melon.' I'll give it to you.
No, I for me I like better 'Bachelor's Carnation.'
Mama, what are you going to wear tomorrow night to Jerry's folks?
Look how I forgot. I have a very important sisterhood meeting.
It's the committee on ways and means and I'm chairlady.
Well I'm afraid somebody else will have to bang the gavel.
I want you to come with us.
Listen, Jerry's father I like very much.
But Jerry's mother and me...
Is there a law that says the bride and groom's family have to love each other?
Mama, I'm asking you, please.
Jerry has to tell his family. about the new assignment ...
... and we want you to be with us.
- So when do I hear about the new assignment?
Will you come?
Alright. So I'll go to the vault in the morning and get my bar pin.
- Alice!
- Yes?
- How about bringing me a drink?
- You got it.
Can I make you one, mama?
Yep, a celery tonic with a Dr. Pepper on the side.
Don't be so patronizing, Mama, you've had a schnapps or two in your time.
Only at weddings and Bar-Mitzvahs.
Come on in, let's chat with Jerry.
Ask Jerry if he wants me.
Oh, Mama, you don't need permission to go into your own bedroom to see your son-in-law.
A man without his pants on doesn't want to see his mother in law.
Knock.
We're barging in.
Come on, Mama.
I just love the smell of Bay Rum .
- Jerry.
- Thank you darling.
Mama's just busting to hear the news.
You have a new position? Where is it, in Washington maybe?
- Jerry, don't sit on the bedspread!
- Sit, Jerry, sit.
It's drip dry.
Mama, finally I'm out of the consular service and into an embassy as junior economics officer.
- What embassy?
- And he's been raised from Class 5 to Class 4.
It's better if the numbers go lower?
It means that he starts at $ 9,095 a year ... and he goes up to $10,630 in three years.
That's already real money. But where?
Mama, I don't know whether you know how these promotions are made...
So tell me.
Well, after evaluating my performance records they've decided on this big jump.
They sprang it on me yesterday and Alice and I really celebrated.
So let me celebrate too!
Mama, Jerry's going to be attached to our embassy in Japan.
Japan.
Oh, it's a great opportunity for you, Mama.
I'll going to be on Mr. Noah Putnam's staff.
He's the man who's going to conduct major trade negotiations with the Japanese government.
And Jerry's going to have a month's briefing in Washington before we sail.
And that means you'll be stationed in Tokyo.
That's it, Mama.
And you'll be living with the people who killed your brother.
Mama I know how difficult this is for you and how deeply you must feel, but that's years and years ago.
The world has changed, Mama. We're in the space age now.
Former enemies have become very important friends.
We're just not going to have any world left at all if we keep on hating.
Maybe you can go to a school and take lessons.
Do not hate the Japanese anymore.
They are our friends.
Do not hate the Germans any more, they are our friends.
I don't know where to go to get such lessons.
For me it's still like it's yesterday afternoon.
You're young, Jerry.
You can still learn.
We're going to be gone for three years.
It's just that I hate to think of her here alone away from the only people she really loves.
Are you still thinking seriously of taking her with us, is that what you're trying to say?
Yes, darling, I am, now we can manage it with just a minor economy.
Darling, that's the very least of it.
But what about her? We're talking about a woman who's lived practically all of her life in Brooklyn.
Let's face it, a very ingrown life.
Now how do you transplant her to a foreign country?
- Oh, Jerry ...
- And not just any foreign country, but Japan.
- Well she'll be so excited about taking a trip and traveling...
- The novelty will wear off in a month.
And what's she gonna do for the rest of the three years?
Look Jerry, Tokyo is halfway around the world.
Now suppose I became pregnant.
Wouldn't it be wonderful to have her around?
Well wouldn't it?
Darling I think it would be wonderful if you were pregnant.
I don't think having your mother around is going to accomplish that.
Well I know one thing it would accomplish. It will make me happy.
Alice. Jerry.
- Yes mama?
- Jerry ...
Don't you want a bite of something to wash down the alcohol?
- Thank you very much, Mama.
- We'll eat in about 15 minutes.
I forgot to put the light under the carrots and peas.
Jerry, I didn't act so nice before.
I did not not say 'hurrah' about your new assignment, so I went into the kitchen and hollered at myself.
- I apologize.
- There's no need for that, Mama.
- You never have to apologize to us, Mama.
- Jerry's right.
We are living in a new age with spaceships and missiles and rockets and--
Everytime you pick up the paper, somebody's sent up another torpedo in the sky.
There's so many up there already there's a traffic jam.
And what'll happen if they bump into each other? I wouldn't even ask it's none of my business.
It's also none of my business if people want to go to the moon.
All I can tell you is, don't make me a reservation.
It's hard to accept the new world, but I gotta learn to live with it.
It seems like everything's changed.
Everything except one thing.
The way I love you, Alice.
And the way I love you, Jerry.
So eat a little something, darling, take a little finger food.
- Mama.
- Hm?
- How would you like to go with us?
- I told Alice I'd go to your folks'.
Mama, I don't mean to my folks. I mean to Tokyo, Japan.
- Alice this is a joke or something?
- No, Mama, it isn't a joke.
Alice wants you to come and so do I.
Japan?
How could I live in Japan?
Alice and you could go sightseeing together, you could go shopping
- Oh there's a million things you could do, Mama.
- And we'd be together.
It would take such a load off my mind.
And what would I like better, Alice, hm?
I appreciate it.
And I thank you.
But I don't think so.
No. I do not think so.
How far is it to Japan?
About 9,000 miles.
Oy...
Oh Jerry!
Good morning, we're glad to have you aboard American Airlines, flight number 17, non-stop jet flagship service to San Francisco.
Our flying time will be 5h 57m.
Captain Jones will give you further information concerning our flight.
The cabin altitude is controlled for your comfort.
Should it change the oxygen mask will automatically fall out within easy reach.
The possibility of having to use these masks is extremely remote but government regulations require a demonstration.
Should the masks drop out, it's most important that you observe the no smoking sign and immediately follow these instructions which your stewardess will now demonstrate for you.
Reach out promptly and sweep the mask to your face, covering your mouth and nose.
Oxygen will immediately be supplied to your mask.
Continue to use the mask until further advised.
If you wish further information and instructions...
It doesn't happen once in a million times, Mama.
What'll be, will be. 
We're up, Mama. Look out of the window.
It's the first time in my life I ever saw a cloud upside down.
It'll all be over soon and we'll be on a wonderful big ocean liner.
I can hardly wait.
May I please have your attention.
Life boat drill will be held at 3 o'clock this afternoon at both posts designated in the state room.
We want you all to be sure to participate.
Thank you.
- The air make you feel better, Mama?
- I'm alright.
- Still squeamish?
- I'm fine.
I brought your sewing basket.
If I feel better, I'll sew tomorrow.
Mama, you haven't eaten anything.
At 4 o'clock they bring around hot tea and a little bought cake, I'll take some.
Oh, Mama, I just can't bear to see you looking so miserable.
- Hi, girls.
- Hello, darling.
Mama, you see any dolphins yet?
All I see is gray water.
Well there'll be dolphins pretty soon, and flying fish and lots of other steamers.
- Good Morning.
- Good Morning.
She's a natural blonde, Alice.
- There's a movie tonight, Mama.
- Which one?
The Law and Jake Wade.
I saw it four months ago at The Albee.
Robert Taylor's in it. You know, Alice,
I think Robert Taylor is Jewish.
Mama, why don't you come on the upper deck with Alice and me while we play some shuffleboard?
As a matter of fact, why don't you get in the game?
Oh you'd be great at it, Mama! All you have to do is hit a round piece of wood with a long stick.
All of a sudden I'm a Mickey Mantle.
Asano-san.
Good morning, Mr. Asano.
May I introduce myself, sir? Black, of the state department.
- I am honored, sir.
- I would like you to meet my family.
It would be an honor.
This is my wife, Alice.
How do you do, Mr. Asano?
And my mother-in-law, Mrs. Jacoby.
How do you do?
Both the ladies are going to Japan for the first time.
As a matter of fact, so am I.
I would be very happy to be of any assistance.
If perhaps you wish to play golf at my country club or to make inquiries of any kind my office is completely at your disposal.
We're very grateful, sir, but I hope we won't have to bother you.
I'm sure the embassy will take care of everything.
You have a most efficient embassy.
And now I beg to be excused.
Mama, are you sure you don't want to come up and watch the shuffleboard?
I'm sure, you go along. Alice needs the exercise.
No, I'll stay here with you.
- Please, I'd feel better if you go.
I'll stay here and look at the fog.
- Jerry, please take her?
- Alright, Mama.
- See you later, Mama.
- Bye-bye, Darling.
- I don't think we ought to leave her.
- Darling, she's got to talk to a Japanese sometime.
Now Alice, if you have no faith in your mother, I have.
Permit me.
- Thank you, very much.
- You're welcome.
That is simply the ship's whistle indicating high noon, Mrs. Jacoby.
Nothing to be alarmed about.
Thank you.
The sea is extremely choppy this morning.
That is not unexpected.
At this northern latitude.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Come on, Mama, get your coat.
- Where are we going?
- It's only the lifeboat drill.
Don't worry, we're not sinking.
The way I feel, sometimes I wish we were.
Mama.
It's a little skimpy I think I need a larger size.
- Where's Jerry?
- Right here, Mama.
Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen.
I'm Mr. MacMillan.
Fire and boat drills are conducted at least once a week at sea aboard every American ship in accordance with the regulations of the US Coast Guard.
You are to report to this station, Number 5, with your life jacket on and properly secured upon hearing six or more blasts on the ship's whistle with corresponding ringing of the ship's alarm bells.
This is your lifeboat.
It is fully equipped to sustain life at sea.
Including oars, sails, first aid equipment, water, food, K-rations ... a radio which can send out a signal of up to about 50 miles.
We of the SS President Hoover appreciate your interest and cooperation.
The drill is now completed. Thank you very very much for your cooperation.
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you.
- Are you all right, mama?
- Certainly I'm all right!
- Give me the life jackets, children, I'm going downstairs.
- No no, I'll take them, Mama.
- I will.
- Children... stop treating me like I'm made of glass.
Stay up, have a good time, give a person the life jackets.
Thank you, Mama.
The life jacket must be very uncomfortable, can I help you?
I don't need any help. Thank you very much.
May I ask. Have I offended you in some way?
- No.
- If so, I should like to apologize.
- It is not necessary.
- You take this attitude because I'm Japanese?"
- Yes.
- Because of the war.
Because of my son.
He was in some way affected?
I wish you would tell me, please.
All right.
It was all in a telegram.
"The secretary of war has asked me to express with deep regret that your son David Elias Jacoby was wounded in action at Attu on May 14, 1943.
Address mail to Sgt. David Elias Jacoby care of Hospital Directory Section 8 PO, San Francisco.
Signed Julio, Edgerton General."
Then they sent for us.
By the time we could get to our child he was gone.
Yes, Mr. Japanese. My son was in some way affected.
Our son was killed in a destroyer of the Thunder class by an American dive bomber.
Our daughter... was a nurse in Hiroshima in August 1945.
All because you and Mr. Hitler wanted to run the world.
My wife and I did not so wish, Mrs. Jacoby.
Nor did our son or our daughter or anybody we knew what most of us wished for was a... happy and peaceful existence with the flowers, the moon and the sunshine.
Is that so very different from what you wish, Mrs. Jacoby?
No.
Then ... shall we start again?
How do you do?
How do you do?
Good morning, Mr. Black.
Good morning, Mr. Asano.
It appears that the captain has found his way into the sun.
It should improve everybody's disposition.
I hope your mother-in-law is feeling better this beautiful morning.
I regret if perhaps I upset her yesterday.
She told me about it.
I think now she does understand a little now.
It's very difficult for her.
Many people in my country hate the Americans unreasonably because of the war.
But your mother-in-law has every justification to hate us.
I sometimes wonder which is worse, war or its aftermath.
I think, sir, that in the case of our two countries we have made rapid strides towards understanding.
To some degree, yes. But there are still problems.
No problem is unsolveable for men of good will.
We both sound as if we are making after dinner speeches.
You will be a distinct addition to your embassy.
I plan to try, sir.
For that you also plan to... familiarize yourself with the problem of free markets, a subject that generates more heat than good will.
The entire matter is under intensive study, sir.
For the conference in August.
No, Mr. Black, I have not been reading your mail.
It so happens that my government has asked me to participate.
It is perhaps fortunate that we meet in these agreeable circumstances and can discuss these matters informally.
When you care to see some figures on the textile question from the Japanese point of view, I have here...
I think you'll agree, Mr. Asano, that by August the situation may have levelled off, and we'll both be better prepared to make considered evaluations of your figures.
No, sir, I do not agree.
- Good morning, Jerry.
- Good morning, Mama.
Good morning, Mrs. Jacoby.
Good morning, Mr. Asano.
I have some Smith Brothers cough drops.
- Good for coughing.
- Thank you.
- Jerry, I have Life Savers, if you want some.
- No thank you, Mama.
- Very soothing. Excellent flavor.
- Keep them. I have plenty.
Thank you very much.
I know, I know. It's 12 o'clock, high noon.
My watch says 1 o'clock, I forgot to put it back the hour last night. 
Try to remember that next Wednesday we cross the International Date Line and lose an entire day.
And how do I do this on my watch?
You do nothing. It's Tuesday, then it's Thursday. 
What happens to Wednesday?
You get two Wednesdays on the way back.
For me that won't be for a long time.
This is, I imagine, your first trip abroad?
- No, my third.
- Usually to Europe?
I started in Europe. I was born in Russia.
Near Moscow.
I was in the Soviet Union last summer.
In my day it was plain "Russia," with the tsar.
That's why my father escaped to New Haven, to my uncle's, so he shouldn't have to serve in the Tsar's army.
Then a year later, my sister Gussie, then my sister Rachel, then my mother.
Finally, I was elected. That was some long trip.
May I ask, Mrs. Jacoby, how old you were when all this happened?
Who carries around their birth certificate?
But like my mother used to figure it out,
I was born the fifth candle of Hannukah.
The fifth candle of what, Mrs. Jacoby?
Hannukah. The feast of lights.
That would be sort of in December ... because it's like Christmas time.
Anyway, that's when I was born. The year after, my mother's father died.
So when I finally got to New Haven, I was... a month on... 12 and a half.
You were a very very little girl to have all that trouble.
Mama, I never heard that story.
Listen...
I nearly forgot it myself until I smelled the ocean,
Then all of a sudden it came back to me... "precipitado."
You remember your Spanish.
I've met so many foreigners in my life, Mr. Asano,
That I can speak a word here and there in lotsa languages.
Polish, Hungarian, Russian, Hebrew, Yiddish, of course ... and I even manage a little English now and then.
I find your English both clear and precise.
I wish Miss Barber could hear you say that.
I'd be happy to tell her.
She was my English teacher in girl's high.
She used to give me special lessons.
The hardest word in English is 'the'.
The hardest word in English is 'lollipop'.
You're sitting in a draft?
I had a little cold when I got on board, I don't think I'm over it yet.
So here, take a little aspirin.
Thank you, but I took an antihistamine this morning.
See? Now that I don't like.
I wouldn't do that unless it was absolutely necessary.
- You're dizzy?
- No.
To me the best medicines are always the simple ones.
Soapy water and stewed plums.
Where are you going, Jerry?
I'm just stretching, Mama.
Excuse please.
Here, take a blanket.
When you have a cold, you should always keep your feet always warm.
Thank you.
My wife shares your respects for warm feets, Mrs. Jacoby.
She died three years ago last May.
So ... you've had a cupful too.
I lost my husband also. Not quite four years ago.
She was sick long?
From the time of the diagnosis and the end, three short, very long weeks.
My Sam was sick almost fifteen months.
Would you believe that up to the last minute he was active in business.
- What was his business, Mrs. Jacoby?
- Artificial flowers.
I have a subsidiary that makes artificial flowers.
You have?
If you'll excuse me, the Japanese were our worst competitors.
You wanna take my advice?
Go into your cabin and take a cup of tea with lemon and honey, and every half an hour gargle with hot water and peroxide.
- You got peroxide?
- No, but I'm sure I shall be all right.
All I have to do is take a look at your eyes to know you got a temperature.
What other miracles do you keep deep in that bag, Mrs. Jacoby?
I had a thermometer. I must have left it in my valise.
I'll go and get it. Do you want something, Jerry?
- No thanks, Mama.
- I do not like to put you at all this trouble.
It's no trouble. And on my way I'll stop and talk with the dining room steward.
From me he expects anything. You know, Jerry?
The way he looks at me, I'm sure he thinks I'm 'meshuggah'
What does ... 'meshuggah' mean, Mr. Black?
My mother-in-law uses that word so often, she forgets that it isn't English.
It means crazy.
Well, not insane, but, let us say, scatterbrained.
Well, Mr. Black, if your mother-in-law is 'meshuggah', then clearly it is a very delightful thing to be.
Room steward.
Steward, I would appreciate it very much it if would wrap this for me, please 
Of course, sir.
- You want it jazzed up for a present?
- Just use white paper and paper cord.
I have them, sir. I do many Japanese packages.
Use two sheets of paper, as one sheet is for an unhappy occasion, and this is not an unhappy occasion.
Would you like me to get you some raw fish, sir?
- Raw fish?
- Well, in Japan ... it is customary to give raw fish with gifts on happy occasions.
Raw fish is very old fashioned.
The modern way is to use seaweed.
- Yes sir.
- Thank you very much.
- It worked out alright, didn't it, Jerry?
- What?
I was afraid at first, but ... Thank goodness she's come out of her depression.
That she has.
She treats the entire passenger list as though they were her nephews, nieces, and cousins.
When I see her with Mr. Asano gossiping away as though he were an old friend on a park bench.
Well about that I have reservations.
You do?
Well tonight he sent another bottle of champagne to the table.
I don't like to get gifts from people with whom I have to do business.
I'm sure no congressional investigation committee's going to accuse you of a conflict of interest over two bottles of wine.
I think Mr. Asano plays with different rules.
Good evening, Mr. Graham.
- Ah, enjoying the sea breeze, darling?
- Yes, Mama.
Sit, Jerry, sit.
- I hear you've been sipping brandy.
- You told me to be sociable.
You know, they're very nice people. He's the doctor with standard oil, and they live in a compound with ten 'amas,' which is how you say servants in Indonesia.
I never noticed that scarf before, Mama.
- Very French.
- Mr. Asano gave it to me.
He bought it for his daughter-in-law, but he wanted me to have it as a remembrance for the cough drops.
It's a very Japanese custom called ... okaeshi.
- It's lovely. That was very sweet of him.
- I like it.
- Jerry and I are going to play bridge, Mama.
- I know. With the English couple.
You know, she is American. She met him in Los Angeles when he was a vice-consul.
There's not a biography on this boat you don't know, Mama.
Do you tell everybody about us?
When you're proud of your children, you talk about them.
- Want to come watch us play?
- No, I'm meeting Mr. Asano.
We're going to play dominoes. You know I won a dollar from him?
He'd be a very good payer if he'd concentrate. He talks too much.
- What does he talk about, Mama?
- You know what men talk about. Business.
- He's got a lot on his mind.
- Like what?
- Like duty.
- Duty?
On his goods. Jerry understands what I'm talking about. 
- There's going to be a big conference in August.
- Yes I know that, Mama.
Good evening.
Mrs. Black.
- Mr. Black.
- Good evening.
I have just radioed my office in Tokyo and told them to send a car and a station wagon to meet me at Yokohama.
If your embassy has not made arrangements, please feel free to...
All arrangements have been made. Thank you, sir.
I thought we might play outside, Mrs. Jacoby, it's quite stuffy below decks.
Fine.
Perhaps you will care to join us?
Four handed dominoes is very stimulating and quite unpredictable.
- Thank you, sir, but we do have a date.
- Please excuse us.
- We'll see you later, Mama.
- Go. Make a slam.
The moon's like a regular pumpkin tonight.
In my country, moon viewing is a tradition.
We have a holiday for it.
- A special holiday for looking at the moon?
- It's called tsukimi.
Moon viewing is held on the evening of the 15th of August and again on the 13th of September.
If one goes moon viewing on the first occasion, and fails to do so at the second opportunity, it is said to be a one sided moon viewing and is not approved of.
- You think that's strange, Mrs. Jacoby?
- Oh no.
In our religion we celebrate two days practically everything!
- There are many festivals.
- Oh yes...
In Japan there is a festival for almost everything.
In the spring it's Showa no Hi.
We have the same.
In the spring is Shavuos.
Shavuot.
- In the fall it is Shobun no Hi.
- Shobun no Hi.
I hope you will celebrate Shobun no Hi with me.
We decorate our houses with grains and the fruits of the earth.
We do the same.
We have a Sukkot.
A little hut we build, and put on grapes and apples.
Oh it sounds enchanting.
Thank you.
I hope you will invite me to one of your festivals.
If we have a festival in Tokyo you'll be invited I assure you.
But my children, I don't think they observe.
- You know how modern children are, Mr. Asano.
- Indeed I do, Mrs. Jacoby.
- But we have to learn to live modern too.
- That is difficult.
So what's easy? Whatever comes into your life, you take.
You transcend.
- I beg your pardon?
- You transcend.
It is, in essence, the philosophy of the Zen Buddhists.
To over-simplify what we believe,
The torments of life are trials which, successfully overcome, lead to the serenity of enlightened spirits.
You mean, if you have 'tsores' ... trouble... you come out of it a better person if you live through it.
Obviously you have studied Zen Buddhism.
No, I'm a plain woman.
I've had my share of happiness and worry, of 'kvelling' for my husband and my children...
Kvelling?
How can I explain 'kvelling'?
Well...
'Kvelling' is the way you look, and the way you feel, when something wonderful happens to someone you love.
It's like .... well ...
It's like when Alice graduated from Smith with the highest honors.
It's pride.
No, no, it's more. It's...
It's kvelling.
'Kvelling' would be an excellent addition to the Zen Buddhist vocabulary.
If I should tell anybody I'm on a ship's deck 1,000 miles from Yokohama ... explaining 'kvelling' to a Japanese gentleman, who would believe it?
I will be equally hard pressed to explain it to my daughter-in-law.
I love that music.
Sam and I took the children to that play on our anniversary.
Afterward we all went dancing at the Copa.
Sam always liked ....
Whatever I do, whatever I say,
I always come back to Sam.
Everything reminds me.
I just don't believe he's gone.
Nor do I.
We may be deluding ourselves in this area, Mrs. Jacoby, but we follow an historical pattern.
We do?
Different cultures have arrived at the same conclusion independently.
The Chinese and the Romans, for instance.
Centuries ago, Cicero I think it was said:
"If I err in my belief that the souls of men are immortal, I gladly err.
Nor do I wish this error, in which I find delight, to be wrested from me."
Whatever I think, I discover someone thought it before I did.
Would you care to dance?
- I haven't danced in a blue moon.
- Nor have I.
Shall we try?
- I couldn't...
- It was your idea!
Live modern!
I didn't know that they danced like this in Japanese.
I learned to waltz in Oxford in 1925.
Look, Alice, we're dancing.
I saw you through the door.
I'm dummy so I thought I'd come out and join you.
- You get so warm when you dance.
- Can I get you a cool drink, Mrs. Jacoby?
I don't like to trouble you, but maybe a little seltzer.
A club soda, please.
- May I get you something, Mrs. Black?"
- No, thank you, Mr. Asano.
What's the matter, Alice?
You have that look on your face like when you used to cut school.
Mama...
What's the matter, darling?
What happened all of a sudden?
Mama, when I first went to Costa Rica with Jerry ...
I met a woman, a Costa Rican, the wife of a Cabinet member.
She was wonderful to me,
I really depended on her.
And one day she came to me and asked me to ask Jerry to talk to the Prime Minister ... because her husband was being fired.
I realized what a babe in the woods I was.
I was just being used.
So ... you think Mr. Asano is just being nice to me because of Jerry?
In a month Jerry will be in an important hassle with Japanese manufacturers, of whom Mr. Asano is the most important.
Am I making myself clear?
I understand plain English.
Our government is trying to get the Japanese to voluntarily cut down exports before Congress passes a restrictive tariff act.
You know what a restrictive tariff act is, Ma?
Yes...
Your papa and me wrote to our congressman for such an act before you were born.
Sorry, Mama. I keep forgetting that you were in business.
And in business with one look you can tell what a person is, and I tell you, Mr. Asano is an honorable man.
And he's not being nice to me just so Jerry should be on his side.
Try to understand, darling.
In foreign service you have to be very careful of easy friendships.
Now I was so glad that you found somebody to talk to, but... on the other hand you must admit it was a little odd.
After all, he is a millionaire.
Oh, and there's a law that says Mrs. Jacoby can only talk to paupers, mm?
No certainly not
The only point is ... he is a Japanese.
And I think he's from Texas.
Mama, please think about what I'm saying.
I am thinking, Alice.
I'm thinking how you told me to mix and mingle and be like everybody else.
So I stick one toe in the water and already I'm drowning.
All right. Go back to your bridge game.
And don't eat your heart out. If that's what you want and that's what Jerry wants,
I won't talk anymore to that...
- ... that 'gunnif.'
- Oh, mother, you didn't have to say that.
- That's what you were trying to say.
- No I...
Thank you.
- And what about our game, Mrs. Jacoby?
- I was just talking to Alice, and tomorrow's our last day out and I have so much packing to do.
I thought I'd just go along to my cabin and put my packing in motion.
I understand.
Mr. Asano ...
I want to thank you for the scarf, for the dancing ... for everything.
It has been my pleasure, Mrs. Jacoby.
I beg to be excused. Good night.
Mama, handled that like a diplomat.
Some diplomat.
Thank you for the compliment.
I wanted to make a friend out of an enemy.
So what did I do?
I made an enemy out of a friend.
You'll find everything in order. Follow me to the taxi, please.
Thank you.
Mama, why don't you sit down here while we get the cab, huh?
All right, Jerry.
Mrs. Jacoby.
Should you wish to go sightseeing, or think I could help you, please accept my card.
Thank you, Mr. Asano.
- It was a pleasure to meet you.
- The pleasure was entirely mine, Mrs. Jacoby.
We're ready, Mama.
You could've at least said goodbye to Mr. Asano, Alice.
I didn't have the chance, Mother.
What's the...?
Protection from germs.
His or ours?
Well I've been waiting for you all!
- You're Alice Black.
- Yes, hello.
- And you're Mr. Black?
- How do you do?
- And I'm sure you must be Mrs. Jacoby!
- How do you do?
I'm Lily Putnam.
And this is your new home.
And welcome to Tokyo!
- And I hope you're all very happy.
- It's very kind of you to meet us, Mrs. Putnam.
- We're very grateful.
- Oh likewise.
We were delighted we could get these accommodations for you, Mrs. Black.
There aren't many available western houses in Tokyo.
If you couldn't see the pagodas, the neighborhood looks like Flatbush.
Oh, this is Ichiro Watanabe, your number one boy.
We call him Eddie.
It is a great honor to welcome my new bosses, who are American big shots.
- Is he really ours?
- Yes indeed.
And he speaks English. Treat him as though he were a precious jewel.
- He's that hard to come by.
- It's very nice of you to do this for us.
I know how hard it is to come to a strange country.
- I've been to so many of them.
- We are very grateful.
You won't be, Mrs. Black, when you hear the schedule I've got worked out for you.
It's a back breaking job, being a diplomat's wife in Tokyo.
You've got to pay formal calls on everybody who outranks you, and everybody you outrank has got to pay formal calls on you.
It's nice to have people visit.
Well ... you don't really visit ... you just leave cards.
You come this way into rumpus room, and I bring you cup of tea, or maybe Coca-Cola?
And I am also very good at making Bull Shots.
- You want Bull Shots?
- No, thank you, Eddie.
Rumpus room.
You see? It's really rather nice.
A little on the gingerbread side, but it was built in the late 19th century ... for Her Majesty's Ambassador.
When you put in your personal touches ...
I somehow had visions of Japanese screens, and waterfalls, and floral arrangements.
Well, at least it's larger than the bungalow we had in Costa Rica.
It's very nice, a little dusty maybe, but ... with a little Dutch cleanser we'll make it look like a doll.
First we ought to open the drapes, it'll let a little light in.
Mrs. Jacoby, if you want to draw the curtains, I suggest that you ask Eddie.
In a Japanese household, there really must be only one, well, as Eddie puts it, boss.
So I think you ought to make your household arrangements accordingly.
Well really it's going to be a joint responsibility.
What's joint about it? Jerry and Alice are the bosses, and I'm a guest.
Then, Eddie, would you mind drawing the curtains?
Look! A regular telephone just like in Brooklyn!
Could you believe it?
Moshi moshi. Hai.
Chotto matte kudasai.
It was embassy, ​​Black-san.
Putnam-san, for you, Black-san.
Hello.
This is Mr. Black.
Yes indeed, Mr. Putnam.
Thank you very much.
Your representative met us at the boat and got us through with great dispatch.
Yessir, Mrs. Putnam is here.
She's been very kind.
Well of course, sir, if you want me.
No, sir, no need to wait until the morning.
I'll come now.
Thank you, sir. Goodbye.
- You're not going to leave, Jerry.
- It's important.
- It really is, Alice.
- But on our first day?
Business is business, Alice.
Now you get settled and I'll be home very soon.
- Thank you again, Mrs Putnam.
- It's been a great pleasure.
If you get a chance, please tell my husband it would be nice if he was on time for dinner tonight!
Bye everybody. If there's anything I can do to help, please call on me.
- Well thank you very much.
- Thank you so much! Bye, Jerry.
Goodbye, darling.
Well, Mrs. Black, you've had your first taste of what it's like here.
I'm afraid we're not going to see our husbands very often these next few months.
I'm accustomed to it, Mrs. Putnam. I've already had a tour of duty in Central America.
But Japan is a very formal post.
Now, what are your plans?
Well, I thought we'd get settled and then Mom and I would go sightseeing.
What a wonderful idea!
But you've come right into the preparations for a conference and I want you to get to meet everybody.
It's very important for your husband, and for us.
You're included too, Mrs. Jacoby.
Don't worry about me. I'll be fine.
I have such a lot to do.
I have letters to write, and
I'm making Alice a skirt, and ...
Well. I'm so busy.
Alice, I wonder if I can go to my room, I'd like to put a little water on my face.
- I don't even know where the rooms are, Mother.
- I have already selected rooms for all of you.
Follow me, Jacoby-san.
- I'll go with you, Mom.
- You stay and talk to Mrs. Putnam ... and make up your social engagements, darling.
- Goodbye and thank you.
- Mrs. Jacoby.
Follow me.
It's a tremendous adjustment for Mama.
This is your room, Jacoby-san.
Nice size.
Dressing room.
And this is the bathroom.
Yeah?
It works?
This whole house western, except for bathroom which is Japanese.
What's so Japanese?
You sit on little stool and maid pour bucket of hot water on you.
And then you enter tub.
Listen, if that's the way you do it, I'll try.
Hoo ha...
- Hello, Mr. Putnam.
- Welcome, Mr. Black. Good to see you again.
- Good to see you, sir.
- Well thank you.
Sit down.
We could use your intellect and your experience.
Thank you sir.
I would not have asked you to come here on your first day in Tokyo, except that I am now led to understand that Mr. Asano was aboard ship with you.
Yes sir.
He's an old line individualist.
And our hardest nut to crack.
It may be an advantage that you developed a rapport.
- I'm not sure whether you'd call it a "rapport" or not.
- We'll see.
The doyo season is only a couple of months away.
The 'Doyo' season, sir?
It's early August.
The time when the farmer drains his rice fields on the basis of the lunar calendar.
I study Japanese customs every night.
And I hope you'll do the same.
I already have, sir.
I'm very happy to arrive in Japan in the year of the tiger.
Well! Well you have been studying.
That's fine. Fine.
- Where's Mr. Asano?
- Any minute now.
Excuse, please.
Mr. Black.
Good morning, sir.
I hope your family is happy in Japan.
Yes, sir.
Thank you for asking.
Please give my respects to your mother-in-law.
Thank you sir.
Shall we be seated gentlemen?
And shall we continue with these proceedings?
We are honored that Mr. Asano has finally agreed to join these deliberations.
Mr. Asano has asked to make a statement.
We are honored that the representatives of the American government have come to us to deal with accommodations.
I am sorry if up to now discussions have been unfruitful.
When you get home, Mr. Black,
You might ask your mother in law for some Smith Brothers cough drops.
Eddie!
Eddie!
Eddie!
Eddie, take away the ironing board.
But first, fix the television.
The up and down doesn't stop, and when it does, it's like herringbone tweed.
I will tune it properly.
The Lo-Hi's I can get in Brooklyn.
But we are hep-cats for American music!
That marriage is already in Reno.
- How you understand, Jacoby-san?"
- By the pictures.
The couple are always arguing because she's jealous, so I figure he's got another woman.
Oh no! It is she who has another man!
When I look at it my way, it's John's other wife.
He's been drinking maybe.
What's he saying?
The program has been pre-empted ... by championship sumo wrestling match!
- Shall we watch then?
- Eddie, please!
- You don't like sumo wrestling?
- What's to like?
They sit around and squat, and then they jump up like crazy people!
- ... and give each other such a smash!
- This one a number one smasher! I bet on him!
Good luck.
Turn it off, Eddie.
It's enough, already, turn it off.
Maybe there's something on the radio.
Oy...
Try the station of the Armed Forces station, maybe.
In spite of the Chinese wall that's helped the home run average of the visitors, the Los Angeles Dodgers moved into a commanding four and a half game lead last night when they massacred the San Francisco Giants 12 to 4.
Turn it off, Eddie.
It is wonderful about the Los Angeles Dodgers.
I don't want to hear about them since they moved from Brooklyn.
Even though we all miss them.
Now what am I going to do?
Why don't you go for a walk?
- In the rain?
- It stops and starts.
You go between.
If I walk away one block from this house, I get lost.
Why don't you go to the movies?
I saw a very good picture ...
The Law and Jake Wade.
Again with Jake Wade.
I like Robert Taylor.
You know, Jacoby-san, I think Robert Taylor Japanese.
Well, you will humbly pardon me now, I must go attend to my duties in the kitchen.
Eddie, why are you running?
Sit a minute.
Tell me about your girl.
It's serious?
She is a very old-fashioned family,
Jacoby-san.
- We met through a 'nakodo'.
- What's a 'nakodo'?
Nakodo is ...
Is a relative or a friend who arranges a suitable marriage.
Ah, a shadchan, a marriage broker.
No, nakodo.
He has suggested we marry.
But our families must study the suggested bride or groom as to, oh, health, wealth, intelligence, character ...
That's a very good idea.
- No, not good...
- No?
No, no...
They do not like me because
I spend too much time in Shinjuku ... which is considered to be very bad section of Tokyo.
- And is it?
- Mm ... it is very jazzy there.
And I am well respected.
You know, Jacoby-san ...
If you were to get a few cartons of cigarettes, and some whiskey, and some French perfume from the embassy commissary,
I could sells it on the black market and we could splits the profit.
Don't be such a businessman, and don't make me your partner!
And Eddie ...
Don't ever let me hear such talk in this house again.
Never again let me hear it!
- I go to work for Canadian embassy!
- No, Eddie please!
Canadian Embassy...
Eddie, I don't want my daughter upset.
If you were to part with a few miserable yen, I might...
Again yen!
No more, Eddie.
Hello, Eddie.
Why were you ironing in the living room, Eddie?
Oh I was not ironing, Black-san. Jacoby-san was ironing.
Oh I see ...
Hello, Mama-san.
- Hello, Alice-san.
- Were there any messages, Mama?
- Eddie takes the messages.
- Eddie?
Oh yes, Black-san, your husband called and he asked me to give you the following message:
He is now in conference with Number 1 man.
Thank you. Anything else?
Only that Jacoby-san spoke to me without dignity.
But I swallow my pride and stay ... for few more miserable yen each week?
All right, Eddie, I'll talk to Mr. Black.
Come on, Mama.
I want to tell you about the cocktail party.
Alice, your shoes are damp, your dress too. Get right out of it.
All right, Mama.
Sounds like you've had a run in with Eddie-san.
That Eddie-san is some gunnif-san.
At least he takes messages.
Number 1 man.
That can only mean ...
Mr. Asano, who else?
It certainly is peculiar he took so long to get to Jerry's big meeting at the embassy.
On the boat that's all he talked about.
It's a diplomatic technique, Mama.
Make everybody nervous, play hard to get.
Jerry explained it all last night.
Did you tell Jerry what I told you about my Davenport?
Well I mentioned it but I think it's best if neither one of us interfere, don't you?
I mean, I'm sure that Jerry's considered every possible alternative.
But Alice, I have a lot of practical experience,
- and if Jerry would just speak to that Mr. Putnam...
- Mr. Putnam is a very difficult man, Mama.
So please don't say anything to Jerry.
All right...
Did you have a good time at the French embassy today, dear?
A wonderful time. I'm really very disappointed that you didn't come along with me.
I went with you a couple of times to your high society.
It didn't turn out so good.
I was afraid to say something wrong.
- What did you do today?
- I watched television and ...
Don't holler. I ironed Jerry's tuxedo shirt.
I wasn't going to mention it, Mama, but you really shouldn't have.
Remember what I told you about losing face with servants.
But they can't iron like you.
Jerry's going to look wonderful at General Garretsen's tonight.
What are you going to wear?
Your black dress with the bugle beads?
I'm not going. If I can't talk to civilians, what would I say to a general?
- Mama, please.
- Alice ...
Don't push.
I'm not going.
That must be our personal ambassador.
Come on, Mama.
- Hello, darling.
- Hello, Alice.
- Hello, Jerry.
- Hello, Mama.
- Did the conference go ok?
- Well, it could have gone better.
Oh I saw Mr. Asano today.
He says hello
I'm glad he's so friendly.
Well I wouldn't exactly say that.
Alice, may I have a drink please?
Sure, honey.
Would you like one, Mama?
No I'm not so hotsy totsy with the drinking. I'll get the ice.
I'll take it without ice, Alice.
- Darling, you look exhausted.
- I'll tell you why I look exhausted, because I am!
Mm, you must've had a very hard day.
It was a beaut...
Tell you what...
Why don't you take a nice hot bath and I'll scrub your back like any good Japanese wife ... and you can tell me all about it.
Let me have a drink first.
I'm making you a double.
Why don't you finish your drink and take a nap?
I'll serve you dinner in bed.
- We don't really have to go to General Garretsen's tonight.
- Yes, we do.
Oh nobody'll miss us. It's going to be a very big party.
- Yes, big, and dreary and a must.
- All right.
You should have seen me today.
I went to the French embassy.
There were about 40 women.
All in Balmain originals.
They served champagne in the drawing room, and Jasmine tea in the conservatory ...
That sounds very classy, honey.
- Hello?
- Mr. Black?
Yes, this is Mr. Black.
- This is Mr. Putnam.
- Oh, hello, Mr. Putnam.
Mr. Black, I've just come from a talk with the ambassador.
And I've had to report that Mr. Asano's negativism was particulary directed against you.
Can you explain it?
I'm not sure, sir. Possibly.
Perhaps if I could speak to Mr. Asano privately tomorrow when the conference resumes ...
The conference will not resume tomorrow.
The ambassador has received word from the foreign ministry that the Japanese delegation wishes an indefinite postponement.
I think it it would be wise, Mr. Black, if you reported to me tomorrow morning at 9:30 with as comprehensive a review of your relations with Mr. Asano as possible.
All right, sir.
Good-bye, sir.
Alice, I have to have a talk with your mother.
- Talk with my mother?
- Yes with your mother.
I don't know if 'my mother' is available, would you care to talk to Mama?
All right, I can do without the sarcasm.
Jerry, what's the matter with you?
What's Mama got to do with it?
I don't know.
Alice, what did you tell your mother on the boat about Mr. Asano?
- Exactly what I told you.
- Well did she talk to him again after that night?
- How do I know?
- Don't you think we ought to find out?"
Jerry, before you put Mama on the carpet, there are a few things I've got to find out.
- The conference was a disaster.
- Why?
- Guess.
- Obviously I'm too stupid.
Oh you couldn't be that stupid.
Didn't I tell you on the boat to...
- Here's the ice, children.
- Thank you, Mama.
- Jerry, I think we'd better get dressed soon.
- We have some time.
I have some things I want to look over.
Mama, would you like to play some cards?
Black-san, have you discussed my raise with your husband?
Not now, Eddie, please.
In the meantime, I'll turn on television. to see how sumo wrestling come out ...
No, Eddie. You cannot turn on television to see how sumo wrestling came out.
Well Jacoby-san let me look at sumo wrestling.
Well I'm not Jacoby-san,
I'm Black-san.
I will not work in the house where I'm not allowed to watch sumo wrestling!
And where mama-san gets the ice and irons the shirts and I'm not allowed to have a few more miserable yen!
I shall accept the offer of the Canadian affair.
Eddie, wait ...
Wait a minute, wait, just a minute.
Look I'm sorry.
We'll be out of here in a few minutes and you can look at television to your heart's content.
And we'll talk privately about your raise.
I am not respected.
It is an honor to have you work here, Eddie.
Thank you, Black-san.
- Now what's this about a raise?
- Well you know how he is...
I said something to him, Jerry.
That's why he's so mad.
I think if you wouldn't interfere with Eddie, Mama, we'd all be better off.
- She doesn't interfere!
- Alice, please.
Jerry's right.
It wouldn't happen again.
Mama ...
There's something I have to ask you.
Do you have to ask her now, Jerry?
- Just because Eddie got upset?
- It's not about Eddie, Mama.
It's about Mr. Asano.
Yes ... you said he wasn't exactly friendly.
No, Mama.
He was, I might say, extremely cold.
- Why?
- I don't know, Mama.
I'm trying to find out.
Now what happened on the boat between you and Mr. Asano?
You know what happened.
We played dominoes and we talked.
- What did you talk about?
- Mama... apparently Jerry had a very bad day at the conference.
Due mainly to your old friend Mr. Asano, Mama.
He refused to accept our proposals, or any compromises so the whole negotiation shattered into a million pieces and we start all over--
What do I mean 'we'?
Somebody will have to start all over again but without Jerry Black!
You were only one of seven men at the conference. It's not your fault!
Oh isn't it? Well if you had been there today you might not be saying that, because our Mr. Asano took a personal delight in needling me, and in frustrating me making it perfectly clear he couldn't stand having me in the same room!
Oh he bowed and I bowed and then we almost hit our heads bowing!
But he took no pains to hide his contempt for me.
Everybody noticed it.
They went hurrying off like bees to tell everybody else it'll be better than dessert at General Garretsen's tonight, believe me. 
Why should he do this to you?
I don't know, Mama.
But perhaps you know the answer better than I do.
Jerry, stop it!
Maybe he didn't like my suggestions on the kind of fabric he should make
We do not discuss your suggestions on the kind of fabrics he should make.
I just want to know what you said to him on the boat after Alice warned you.
I didn't warn her, Jerry!
Whatever I was told to do, I did.
But what did you actually say?
You spoke to him again, didn't you?
Yes. When the boat landed, he gave me his card and said I should call him if I'd like to go for a little sightseeing.
And what did you say after that?
- I didn't take it down in shorthand.
- Was he angry?
No, Jerry.
He was polite.
- Do you have to go on with this?
- Yes I have to!
I hate it, but I have to.
Look, Mama, I've only got one more question.
Did you ever say to him that Alice and I didn't want you to see him because he was a Japanese?
Jerry!
What do you think I am? A crazy old woman ready for a home for the aged?
I'm not a person? I haven't got a brain? What am I, a schlemiel, an idiot?
- Mama, it's all right.
- What's all right?
It's all right I should sit in this house afraid to open my mouth, that's all right?
Well it's not all right. I'm a grown up person and it's not all right!
And I want to go home.
- Mama, we'll talk about you going home some other time.
- We'll talk now.
I've got a few dollars in the bank, enough to take me back to New York and bring me back to Tokyo and take me back to New York again.
So for me you don't have to worry.
Mama, I don't want you to go.
And that money is your savings.
My savings for a rainy day.
And today the sun is shining?
I'm going home.
And I want no more cross examinations!
Jerry, talk to her.
Alice, your mother's a grown woman.
If she wants to go home, she knows what she's doing.
Is that all you've got to say?
- Well then I'm going with her!
- Alice let's be reasonable!
Reasonable about what?
Jerry, I just wanted to find out something.
You come home hurt and wounded about some rotten little conference you shout and raise your voice, you act as though both of us were your enemies...
- All right!
- I'm fed up! You're just like your mother!
Maybe he thinks you're just like your mother.
Always in the wrong place at the wrong time.
It's not your fault.
And it's not Jerry's fault.
It just happens.
Go in and talk to him.
You'll say A and he'll say B then you'll get gladder.
Go.
Eddie, how far is this from here?
Ah, Asano-san!
It's in the district Denenchofu.
- Not far from automobile.
- So call me a taxi.
I can not call for a taxi. I'm gonna have to go out on the street and get one!
And write me down on a piece of paper.
Write me down the address, the telephone number, and where it is.
In Japanese.
You're sure you're writing it right?
Oh yes, Jacoby-san.
And write me on another piece of paper where this house is and this number.
Jacoby-san, you don't know where you live?
Oh I know where I live.
776 Eastern Parkway, Brooklyn, the United States, North America.
Come on, get a taxi.
Here's your taxi, Jacoby-san.
I told him where to go.
Oh Eddie!
Promise me you wouldn't tell anybody where I'm going!
- If I can go to the movies tonight.
- Ask Black-san.
Black-san will say no.
You will say, yes.
- Yes, Eddie, yes. It doesn't matter anymore.
- Thank you.
It says here.
Take me there, take me there...
Jerry, they're gone, they're both gone, Mama and Eddie both.
- They can't be.
- I tell you they are!
Mama wouldn't go anyplace with Eddie, Alice.
And I don't like her out in Tokyo alone at night.
Maybe she wanted to be alone.
Maybe she wanted some privacy.
She always does when she's hurt.
I didn't mean to hurt her, Alice, I've just been so worried.
I didn't help much either.
There's been so much tension.
Don't worry, darling. I'll bet Mama just went to the movies.
I hope so.
You'd better hurry up and get dressed, you're gonna be late for General Garretsen's.
You take longer to dress than I do.
- I'll wait for Mama.
- So will I.
- You've got to be there!
- We both have to be there and we will be, as soon as Mama comes back.
Jerry, do you think you oughta call somebody?
The Security Division at the embassy?
Nonsense. Go on and put your face on.
Hello, embassy?
This is Jerry Black.
Give me the Security Division, please.
How much is that, please?
- Arigato.
- Which house is it?
A number. Has it got a number?
One two three four five.
Five, like a number!
Please. Wait!
You've got the address!
Please...
Hello! Hello!
Is someone home there?
Please!
Excuse me, you know a Mr. Asano?
Mr. Asano, he lives around here ...
Thank you.
Hello, Mr. Asano lives here, yes?
Mr. Asano.
Somebody speaks English here, maybe...
English?
Could I use the telephone?
Tele ... Hello! Hello!
Please ... call me a taxi.
A taxi.
Mrs. Jacoby.
What a surprise.
Oh, Mr. Asano!
I'm so relieved!
Please excuse me for coming without calling up, but I have to talk to you.
But you are wet through. How did such a thing happen?
I came in a taxi, and I got out, and he disappeared!
I've been looking all around.
There are no numbers!
Now it is you who will catch cold.
Please do me the honor to enter my house.
Thank you.
It is customary to remove your shoes.
Oh ... I don't mind.
Come this way.
Will you enter?
Please excuse the disorder in my house.
I don't like to trouble you, but if I...
My house is completely at your disposal.
This is my daughter-in-law, Mrs. Ayako Asano.
How do you do?
She says, "Welcome, it is good of you to come."
My daughter-in-law says if you accompany her, she will do her best to make you comfortable.
Thank you, very much.
I hope I'm not disturbing your supper or something.
It is an honor to have you in my house,
Mrs. Jacoby.
It is something for which I have wished for a long time.
Thank you.
Madame Butterfly.
You look lovely, Mrs. Jacoby.
Will you do me the honor to sit at my table?
I'm sorry we have no Western chairs, but,
I think you will find the zabuton not too uncomfortable.
It's very comfortable.
So tthis is how you live.
- It's like a travelogue!
- It is a great honor that you grace my house.
Mr. Asano, I want to talk to you about something very important.
In Japan, serious conversation is not apt to begin until after the formalities,
I hope you do not mind.
This is green tea.
I hope you find it agreeable.
Tea is tea.
Lovely flavor.
Tastes like hot parsley.
These are bean jam buns.
Served when we have the honor of visits from an important stranger.
Delicious!
Tastes like... cottage cheese.
My daughter-in-law will see that you are given some when you leave.
Thank you.
Beautiful china.
Looks so lovely on the tray.
I have asked my daughter-in-law to give you an identical set.
Oh thank you.
My daughter-in-law says she hopes you will do her the honor of keeping the kimono.
- She feels it is most becoming.
- Thank you, but I couldn't.
Mr. Asano, I want to talk to you about my son-in-law, Jerry.
Mrs. Jacoby, let me show you my house.
We are a crowded island ... and we endeavor, for instance, to make our gardens appear larger than they really are.
This is the home of my ancestors,
Mrs. Jacoby.
We have lived here many centuries.
At the end of the garden you will see a small shrine.
When the weather is more agreeable,
I would like to take you to it.
- That would not violate your faith?
- God's house is God's house.
Never have I seen such a tree!
Like a pretzel!
Not even at Prospect Park! Oh, how I love trees and flowers.
My daughter-in-law will see that you have all the flowers you wish.
It's enough already. ... Mr. Asano.
I want to talk to you about my son-in-law, Jerry.
Mrs. Jacoby, I am forced to break my own custom, because there is something on my mind.
Yes? What?
I must confess I have been a little angry with you.
Oh, I'm sorry.
We had such a pleasant relationship on board,
You made a dull crossing most enjoyable.
I'm very flattered.
And then suddenly you saw fit to reassume... a distant attitude.
This is not what I came to talk about.
I have the feeling that perhaps your children were involved in this decision.
I'm very close with my children
However it is not the children who should instruct the parents, but the parents who should instruct the children.
Not in America.
You are wise and venerable, Mrs. Jacoby.
And only the venerable ... have the experience and maturity ... to understand matters of personal relationships.
Jerry also understands, Mr. Asano.
And if I did something that made you mad at Jerry,
I beg you not to take it out in business.
When I greeted him today in the usual manner, he bowed too low.
That's because Jerry isn't used to bowing.
I would have preferred a Western handshake.
- But, Mrs. Asano, Jerry ...
- Now it's time for sake, Mrs. Jacoby.
Rice wine.
It is served hot, and I think you will find it excellent against the inclement weather.
Thank you.
Kampai!
My family says 'l'chaim',
Mr. Asano.
We were talking about my son-in-law.
I assume you know the nature of my business with your government.
Yes. I understand it didn't do so good today, because you're being very stubborn.
Stubborn, no. Practical.
If we reduce our exports, it will mean a loss of employment for our workers and a severe blow to the national economy.
But that isn't Jerry's fault.
Promise me you wouldn't hold a grudge against Jerry.
My personal feelings are not pertinent, Mrs. Jacoby.
This is a matter of principle.
So you'll give a little and you'll get a little.
My government is well aware that it must give a little, the question is how much.
Originally, your government asked that we reduce our exports of velveteens by 1 million yards annually.
They now ask that we reduce them by 2 million yards annually.
And they didn't suggest how you should take up the slack?
They only promised they would use their best efforts...
That is a phrase frequently employed by your son-in-law.
I regret, their best efforts are not good enough.
You're right. You can't take best efforts to a bank.
Aha, true.
I tried to talk to Jerry, but my daughter does not like me to mix in.
If you have opinions to express,
Ms. Jacoby, by all means, "mix in."
Well...
I really have no right.
Because I don't know anything about business.
I'm a housewife and a consumer.
And I'm only saying this because of my davenport.
What is a 'davenport', Mrs. Jacoby?
These days they call them "hideaway beds."
By day it's a couch, and at night, you pull it out and it's a bed.
Oh genius.
Well I have a davenport in my apartment, which, by the way, I still have a lease on for another year.
On my apartment!
Apartment 2A!
Well, my davenport is a beautiful piece of furniture.
Originally Sam and I bought it from Callahan and Driscoll, on Livingston Street, because Sam and Mr. Driscoll both belonged to the Elks and Mr. Driscoll gave us a lovely price.
- How friendly.
- Mr. Driscoll was a regular prince.
And very smart too.
He was in some trouble in the Depression.
Because he only sold the best Grand Rapids furniture and who could afford it in the 30's?
The 30's were difficult even in Japan.
But Mr. Driscoll, he used his head.
He kept on selling furniture, but he also put in mops, and brooms, and clothespins, and ... the things people could afford, and couldn't do without.
He diversified.
Exactly!
He diversified.
And that's the first thing you should do.
I agree, Mrs. Jacoby, but in what area?
Our market studies have so far given us no indication.
Market studies!
The best market study is personal experience.
So ... where was I?
Where was I?
I think you were with your davenport.
Oh, yes, my davenport.
Last year a company came to the house.
The Rosenzweigs, who live in 4B ... and Essie Rubin, who lives in apartment 1C, and Essie brought along Mr. Wexler, who's in the fountain pen game.
Well...
Mr. Wexler took from his pocket his absolutely guaranteed not to leak fountain pen.
So what happened?
Phht .... all over the davenport.
So Essie and Mr. Wexler nearly died.
The next day Mr. Wexler came over with a special ink remover which he also manufactures.
It worked. It removed the ink.
It also removed the material.
I feel very sorry for Mr. Wexler!
I couldn't be sadder. But I had to have my davenport recovered.
So I decided on baby blue.
Baby blue.
Baby...
Mm hm hm baaabyyy ...
So...
I had to run around to A&S's, Macy's,
Gimbel's ...
You know what you have to pay for upholstery material in America?
My market reports indicate a minimum of $2 a yard.
You go find for $2 a yard!
Five dollars is more like it.
So, maybe I came to it all around the mulberry bush...
This is what I want to tell you.
Here in Japan, with cheaper production costs, you should concentrate on manufacturing inexpensive upholstery material and you'll see!
You'll have no competition in the United States.
Thank you, Mrs. Jacoby ...
I will restudy the market research in that field.
All you have to worry about is, can you modify your looms?
- How do you know about that?
- I'm also practical.
So... So it's settled?
I'm afraid not, Mrs. Jacoby.
You see I have a board of directors to deal with, and stockholders, and my government's views as well.
So why did you let me talk?
You may not have brought a solution, but what you have done is to erect a signpost.
You have forced me to probe more deeply, and I promise I will probe.
Good!
I had concluded that today's meeting was final.
I have changed my mind.
As a compliment to you, Ms. Jacoby,
I will continue my discussions with your government.
With my government or with my son-in-law?
- With your son-in-law.
- Oh, thank you, Mr. Asano,
Thank you thank you! Oh dear!
Well, I've taken up enough of your time.
I'll go and get a taxi.
No no, Mrs. Jacoby! You must stay to dinner!
That's very kind of you, but I've already had a very early dinner.
- I do not think that is so...
- Yes...
No. You are afraid to eat in my house.
You have heard that we eat raw fish and octopuses.
- I never heard such a thing, never!
- But it is true!
However, I have ordered a special dinner for you, to be served on a new set of china and consisting of dishes entirely compatible with Kosher.
- How do you know about kosher?
- You told me.
I told you?
On the boat!
She's such a nice lady.
I wish I could talk to her.
- She doesn't speak a word of English?
- Not a word.
But that is not very peculiar, Mrs. Jacoby, because you do not speak one word of Japanese.
Who says?
I can speak ...
I can say ...
'moshi moshi', which is hello on the telephone...
I can say 'dozo', which is please ... and I can say 'arigato,' which is thank you... and ... wait ... wait a minute there's one more, now let's see ...
I can say you're welcome, which sounds like "don't touch my mustache!"
With those four phrases you will always be happy in Japan!
- Arigato!
- Don't touch my mustache!
Mrs. Jacoby.
There is one thing I have not explained.
Have you observed this scroll?
Oh, it's very pretty.
- Is it hand painted?
- Oh yes.
It's an old Japanese art.
As you see, it shows an ancient empire on one side of a bridge ... and a lady of the court at the other.
The bridge symbolizes that they are apart.
The question is...
Should they cross the bridge?
Is there any reason why they shouldn't?
The emperor was a widower.
And there was much opposition to his remarriage.
You don't say.
Despite his treasures, he was lonely.
- Oh, that's too bad ...
- And when he met this lady ... he was much drawn to her.
Although she was from another province ... not a blood royal ... and indeed of a different religion.
However, after due consideration, and the cutting off of a few heads...
- That wasn't nice!
- Perhaps not.
Thank you.
Finally, all opposition silenced, he crossed the bridge to her ... slowly and steadily ... taking a great deal of care not to stumble.
Good.
So you think the emperor was right?
If they loved each other,
What business was it of anybody else?
They did not meet properly, of course, through a... nakodo.
A marriage broker.
They did not permit a proper lapse of time as is our custom in arranging betrothals.
We also have such a custom.
Sam and I kept company for two years.
As a consequence they did not for instance go to plays, concerts, and national events together ... so that they could learn to know each other.
You think that was wrong?
When you're old there's not much time.
I think the emperor was right.
I'm not sure that I agree with you.
Why don't you agree?
What difference could it have made if they went to plays, concerts, and national events?
- It's a question of etiquette.
- Ah ...
Sometimes you can carry etiquette too far.
I'm old-fashioned, Mrs. Jacoby.
I like to observe the proper form.
Mrs. Jacoby ...
Would you do me the honor of accompanying me throughout the winter to plays, concerts, and national events?
Mr. Asano!
Mrs. Jacoby, I was sure that you understood my allegory.
For me it was just a very interesting story, I ...
Mrs. Jacoby, given time, perhaps we too might cross the bridge and together achieve the serenity of the enlightened spirits.
In the meantime, it can do us no harm to be friends.
I would like very much to be friends.
Then shall we have dinner?
Dozo.
Mrs. Jacoby, you are our most honored guest.
Oh, Mr. Asano. All of a sudden to be a most honored guest!
Ah, good evening.
Good evening, Mr. Black, I've been assigned to the Jacoby case.
Very nice of you to come, Captain Norcross.
Won't you step right in?
This is my wife.
Darling, this is Captain Norcross, of the security division of the Embassy.
Delighted, Mrs. Black.
Why did you call it the Jacoby Case, Captain?
Well that's just a convenient identification,
Mrs. Black.
- Won't you come in, Captain?
- Thank you.
- You're worried, too.
- Oh, nonsense.
Well so far, the news is very encouraging.
We've checked all the hospitals and all the jails in the area... and the morgue ... and all reports of automobile accidents and other violence.
But so far as can be determined, as of this very moment, eliminating imponderables, of course,
Mrs. Jacoby is not involved.
What do you mean by 'imponderables', captain?
Well we've not heard yet from the prefectures of the outlying districts.
My mother is not in the habit of going to outlying districts.
Well, one can't always be sure.
Just recently we had a case of an American woman, who was found with her throat ...
Well, that's enough of that.
Now tell me, was your mother in any way mentally disturbed?
- Certainly not!
- Oh, darling, she was a little upset.
All right, Jerry, let's tell the captain the truth, she was more than upset! We had a crisis here today!
- It wasn't really a crisis!
- Well let's not go into semantics, Jerry!"
Is your mother in the habit of going off on these little jaunts all by herself?
Of course not.
Has she been out in the city much? Sightseeing or perhaps nightclubbing?
I doubt if she's ever been in a nightclub in her life.
- Have you checked our house boy?
- Yes, he wasn't home.
However the Japanese authorities are posting a man, perhaps a squad.
Shinjuku, where he lives, is not a very savory section of the city.
Oh my Lord...
- What's that?
- Somebody's in the kitchen.
Eddie, where've you been? Where's Mama?
Now listen, Eddie, have you seen Jacoby-san?
- Do you know where she went?
- No sir.
I don't believe you, Eddie. I don't like that look in your eye.
Please, Mr. Black. Allow me to do the interrogation if you don't mind.
I am Captain Norcross, I am attached to the Metropolitan Police.
Now I want you to answer a few questions.
- Of course I know that you are not involved in any way.
- No sir.
Where have you been this evening?
- To the movies.
- What picture did you see?
Hercules Unchained.
Now then, Eddie, have you any idea where Mrs. Jacoby is?
I quit. I leave. I go to Canadian Embassy!
Oh dear!
Arigato!
Mama! Mama, don't you ever dare leave this house again without telling us where you're going!
- Mama, we've been out of our minds.
- I was visiting.
Oh, how do you do?
- We are very relieved to see you here, Mrs. Jacoby.
- Well how do you do?
Mama, this is Captain Norcross, he was ...
- Well, he was looking for you.
- I'm sorry you were worried.
But time flies when you're enjoying yourself.
Captain Norcross, we're very grateful for all of your help.
Well I can see that I won't be needed any longer, so...
- Good night.
- Good night and thank you very much.
Oh not at all.
I'll see that headquarters gets the good news.
And I would suggest, Mr. Black, that you give General Garretsen a ting-a-ling and tell them that our little lost sheep has found her way home, wagging her ...
Well, good night.
You have received many lovely gifts, Jacoby-san.
- Arigato.
- Do itashimashite.
Oh, Eddie ...
That will be all, and I'm sorry if we disturbed you.
- We'll work out everything in the morning.
- No need sir.
It is a great honor to work in the house where Mama-san come home with a chauffeur and so many wonderful signs of the regard in which she is held.
Good night.
Well, I better put my packages in my room.
We'll help you, Mama.
Mama, where have you been?
Whose car was that?
Mama, did you have something to drink?
I had a few hot cups of sake.
But where, mama? Where?
Did you ever have sake?
It tastes like hazelnut.
It's very pleasant.
We were going crazy worrying about you.
How many times I went crazy worrying about you?
Mama, how much sake did you have?
I stopped counting.
How long are you going to keep us in suspense? Where did you go?
I went to see Mr. Asano.
- Did he give you these gifts?
- Yes.
Did you ever see the way they wrap things?
It's a shame to open them.
In this package is bean jam buns, pink and green.
And in this package is a kimono with an 'obo'... an 'obi.'
And in this package, is a set of china, service for two.
And in this package is a flower holder, so I should make Japanese flower arrangements.
- What were you doing there?
- Well...
First we had tea and buns.
Then we had supper.
A little milk soup with egg drops.
Then we had, umm ...
- ... broiled fish.
- Mama!
We're not interested in the menu.
If you want to hear the rest, you have to hear the menu. Sit down.
So ... we had broiled fish.
And Alice, I could tell there was nothing on it except a little butter.
We also had gingko nuts, called silver prunes, served on pine needles.
And with supper, his servants played on long banjos
 and a little upside down canoe.
Oh, Jerry, I had a wonderful time!
Then, later, Mr. Asano, and his daughter-in-law and his servants took me out to the car.
A car which both sides go up so that I should get in.
- It's a Mercedes-Benz.
- What then? Mr. Asano should have a Chevy?
Jerry, maybe we have a little sake in the house?
Mama, why did you go to see Mr. Asano?
Well...
I thought if I caused Jerry any trouble, I'd try to fix it up.
- I hope you didn't try, Mama!
- I did.
- What did you say?
- Jerry ...
... you can't blame Mr. Asano. Listen.
First you ask him to reduce a million yards of velveteen, all of a sudden you ask him to reduce 2 million yards.
- Is that a way to do business?
- Mama, you don't understand.
- We're having a lot of pressure put on us by the Commerce Department!
- Yes!
But this is liable to cause Mr. Asano a very bad economic situation.
However... if he can diversify he'll listen to reason.
- Diversify?
- You already had such a conversation, Jerry.
Yes, yes, on general terms, and he rejected it.
Maybe now he wouldn't reject it.
I told him about my davenport.
Mama, you just can't walk into Mr. Asano's house and talk about your davenport!
- This is a highly involved, technical situation--
- What's so involved?
Alice.
Hello.
Yes, this is Mr. Black.
Oh, hello, Mr. Putnam.
Well, my boy, I just received word from the foreign minister
 that there will be a meeting tomorrow morning at ten o'clock.
Oh, and Jerry. The foreign minister pointedly suggested that you be there.
I think we can safely assume that was Mr. Asano's idea.
So I suggested tomorrow, you carry the ball.
And don't forget. Ten o'clock.
Yes, at ten o'clock.
Of course I'll be there, sir.
Good night.
Well?
There's a very important meeting tomorrow morning at 10 o'clock with Mr. Asano and the Japanese representative of the textile industries!
Oh, Jerry!
Well, mama, I guess your conference tonight was a success.
The government ought to put you under payroll!
One high government official in the family is plenty.
Jerry, we really should have a little sake in the house.
Tomorrow I'll buy a case!
Mama, I hereby present you with the first annual Jerry Black award for patience and understanding.
One note of warning, Jerry.
It's only the beginning. Nothing is settled, nothing is arranged.
You're just going to talk some more.
- Only, Jerry ...
- Go on, Mama, you have some more advice for me?
- I should give Jerry Black advice?
- You're holding back, Mama, please don't.
I wouldn't sound like a mother-in-law they make jokes about.
Say whatever you want, Mama.
It's nothing important, only ...
Well...
You know one of the reasons Mr. Asano got mad?
You made a mistake, Jerry, and bowed too low, and he thought you were making fun of his customs.
I know you weren't making fun. You just didn't know.
I tried to learn as much about Japanese customs as I can, Mama.
I just don't have much time.
And you don't have much time either, Alice, huh?
With the socializing and leaving calling cards and drinking tea...
But let me tell you something, children.
It's very important how you speak to foreigners about the little things.
I know because I was a foreigner for a long time.
And foreigners are very sensitive people.
And you don't have to overdo, either.
For instance, the way you treat Eddie.
You don't bow to a boy like Eddie.
Not because he's a servant, and not because he's Japanese.
But because he is wrong.
It doesn't matter what color a person is.
If he's wrong, he's wrong, whether he's white, black, pink, or purple.
Nobody ever had a mother like you in the world!
- Yeah? The whole world, huh?
- Mm-hmm.
Mama, I've got a wonderful idea!
Why don't you two girls get dressed and we'll go on to General Garretsen's!
That's where Mr. Putnam is, and I could hear the music, and the three of us can make an entrance!
- Listen ...
- And tonight you're going to wear your black dress with the bugle beads.
Darling. We can't go.
Mr. Asano is coming here.
Here?
Jerry!
Jerry!
Jerry, Mr. Asano is coming here.
Here? When?
Tonight. It's a Japanese custom called...
- What's that?
- According to Japanese etiquette, if you make a visit on somebody, he has to return the visit right back.
Why didn't he just bring you home?
Because Mr. Asano is very formal about etiquette.
And secondly, I wanted to give you a little chance to be prepared.
- What will we serve him?
- Tea.
Mr. Asano is a very plain man.
Full of wisdom.
And I'd like you to get to know him a little, and you'll see what an unusual man he is.
Don't laugh.
He thinks I'm smart, too.
Wait until the boys in the shop hear that Mr. Asano is sweet on Mama.
And I think I'll just call General Garretsen to explain why I can't be there.
Do you think if I toast some saltines, and we've got some anchovies,
- Do Japanese eat anchovy?
- They invented them!
Then you wouldn't mind if I go with Mr. Asano throughout the winter to plays, concerts, or national events?
- Why not?
- Of course not, Mama, you don't have to ask.
In this country, when a man and woman go to plays, concerts, and national events, it means they're keeping company.
What did you say, mama?
Jerry, I'm sure Mama's just using a phrase.
No. When Mr. Asano says keeping company, he means keeping company.
- Certainly you don't take it seriously.
- Mama knows it's impossible.
Don't you, Mama?
What did you tell him?
Mostly I listened, to a story about an emperor who married a lady of the court.
Married?
Mama, you're a very smart woman, you know what such a marriage would mean.
I don't have to tell you.
You can't be considering it.
- You just can't!
- All I'm doing is thinking.
Mama, there's nothing to think about.
I know what I'm talking about.
I've been to lots of countries.
I've seen a great deal of this kind of thing.
At the very best it's difficult, but with you, Mama, it's... well it's ludicrous!
He means unsuitable, Mama.
Not for a woman like you.
Oh Mama, you're so bigoted you can't even eat a piece of bacon, now how are you going to marry a Japanese?
- Enough!
- I'm sure if you think it over--
I said enough! I mean enough.
- Just let me say this, Mama--
- You said already!
You said bigoted.
Mama, we'd never stand in the way of your remarrying if you wanted to.
If the man were ...
Just let me point out a few facts, Mama.
Do you understand the problems of inter-marriage?
I will discuss that with Mr. Asano, not you.
Mama, you're deliberately evading the central question.
And the central question which aggravates you is that Mr. Asano is a Japanese.
In Brooklyn, when Essie Rubin said she couldn't live with "that element," you got very excited.
Remember what you said?
Because if you don't remember, Jerry, I remember.
You said, "If you want to stop prejudice you have to stop it in yourself."
You forgot it, Jerry?
Or maybe you changed your mind?
And you, Alice.
You agreed with Jerry.
That was theoretical, Mama, on a broad social play.
- It's different--
- When it strikes home.
Yes...
And now, my dear children, I'd like to ask one simple question.
Who is bigoted?
That must be Mr. Asano.
So go answer the door, Jerry?
And put a smile on your face.
And don't stand there like all the pipes in the house just busted!
And Jerry!
Don't say one word about this to Mr. Asano, you hear?
Not one word.
Just go to the door and be pleasant.
- Good evening, Mr. Asano.
- Good evening, Mr. Black.
Won't you come in, please?
- Good evening, Mr. Asano.
- Good evening, Mrs. Jacoby.
Good evening, Mrs. Black.
I'm delighted to see you again.
Good evening, Mr. Asano.
Won't you sit down, Mr. Asano?
- May I offer you a cigarette, sir?
- No thank you. I do not smoke.
I was just telling the children what a lovely dinner I had at your house.
I hope they will dine with me one evening.
Perhaps next Saturday?
Unless, of course, Mr. Black you think it unsuitable during these negotiations.
We would be delighted to come, sir.
You do not say anything, Mrs. Black.
Alice never talks much.
Nevertheless, I have a feeling there is something she would like to say.
Please say it, Mrs. Black.
Mr. Asano, my mother has told me...
Well, of your conversation this evening.
- No doubt you were surprised.
- Yes, I was.
As a matter of fact, I was more than surprised.
- Alice, that's enough.
- Please permit her to continue, Mrs. Jacoby.
I don't quite know how to put it.
You do not approve.
Mr. Asano, I'm certain that if you talked to your own family, if you take all facts into account--
I'm sure, Mr. Asano, that upon deeper consideration, you will--
Mr. and Mrs. Black,
I understand your views completely.
I can even think of arguments which may not have occurred to you.
Because I am a Buddhist from Zhengzhou, deriving directly from the teachings of Prince Shotoku, making things far more complicated than you can possibly imagine.
But any final decision must rest between your mother and myself.
We have the maturity, I hope, to weigh such matters ... you... have not.
Alice, I think Mr. Asano would like a cup of tea.
- It would be a pleasure.
- Excuse me.
- Jerry.
- Yes, mama?
Please get me a sweater or something, it's a little chilly in here.
- Yes of course.
- Thank you.
Do you usually keep your sweaters in the kitchen, Mrs. Jacoby?
Please sit down, Mr. Asano.
It is apparent your children are agitated.
That's putting it mildly.
- Did you speak to your daughter-in-law?
- I did, Mrs. Jacoby.
And what did she say?
Nothing. She would not dream of questioning my judgment.
She wasn't shocked that you were considering keeping company with a Jewish woman?
My daughter-in-law is not aware of the theological differences existing in Caucasian society.
If she has any objection, it is simply because you are white.
I got the same argument from the opposite side.
In view of that, have you reached a decision?
Yes.
Mr. Asano ...
If 'keeping company' means crossing the bridge, then it's no.
You are acceding to your relatives' views?
No.
Then may I ask what prompted your decision?
First I'd like to tell you what did not prompt it.
I don't care about gossip.
And I think we could work it out that I'm orthodox and you're not.
But the answer is still no.
Yes, it's no.
And you know why?
Because I've been weighing it pro and con.
You don't want to marry me, Mr. Asano.
You're lonely for your wife and somebody to talk to.
You look at me and you see her.
All right, she was Japanese and she wore a kimono.
Tonight so did I.
I saw a great deal more than that, Mrs. Jacoby.
No, Mr. Asano.
You are not over your mourning period.
Neither am I.
I'm very honored, and very proud, and deeply touched by what you said to me tonight.
But you're not Sam.
Jacoby-san ...
There is something I neglected to say tonight.
In my way ...
I love you.
You can take the green look off your face.
I told him no.
But not for your reason.
For my own.
Reasons that you didn't give me a chance to tell you.
What did he say to you, Mama.
Only something for me to hear.
You think it was easy?
You think it wasn't good to be treated with respect and admired by a wonderful man?
And courted the way Papa courted me years ago.
It was, I can't lie.
I had an evening in which I was young again.
And it's over.
But at least I have another memory.
And maybe another regret.
And now, my dear children,
I want you to get me a ticket on the first airplane leaving tomorrow morning for International Airport New York, because I'm going home
Oh no, Mama...
We'll do better.
You did the best you could.
It made no sense for me to come, and it makes no sense for me to stay.
You'll write me often, and I'll write you back.
What are you standing alone, Jerry?
Come on in, the water's fine.
If oxygen should be required due to a change in cabin pressure, oxygen masks for each passenger will automatically drop from the service unit above your seat.
To obtain oxygen, gently grasp...
It doesn't happen once in a million times.
You've flown before?
Certainly, so don't worry.
I'm sitting right next to you. You got more questions? Just ask.
- Arigato.
- Don't touch my mustache.
You hear me calling you
Beneath the window some sweet day
And when I'm calling you
Then you'll know I'm home to stay
Yoo-hoo, Bertha!
Uh-huh!
I brought you my sterling silver fruit bowl for the center of the table.
Thanks, Essie, but the table is just the way I want it.
Bertha, would you like me to get the appetizer?
- That'd be very nice, Essie.
- Okie-dokie!
I still think my sterling silver fruit bowl would look much better.
But it wouldn't be mine, Essie.
That little flower looks very skimpy.
- It's moriban style.
- Oh.
Another word you learned in Japan, huh?
Another word I learned from the Japanese book of etiquette.
Bertha, you look stunning.
It's my $29.95 number.
I like the way you fixed the fish, Essie.
But you didn't put the horseradish on the lettuce?
You only have red horseradish and that's not for a formal dinner!
I'll run down to Waldbaum's delicatessen and get some white.
Don't run, Essie.
Mr. Asano will enjoy the color.
Besides, all you want to do is get out of here to avoid meeting him.
Well frankly, Bertha, I'm very embarrassed.
Do I bow, do I shake hands?
You just act natural.
Oh ...
Essie!
Hm?
There's a lot of neighbors on the stoop.
What did you do? Send a broadcast that Mr. Asano's coming?
I just told the janitor!
It's a regular reception committee. Mrs. Rosenzweig brought out her camp chair.
You know, Bertha, you should've gotten a maid to serve.
It's not too late, my cleaning woman is still in my apartment!
And she even has a little cap with a black bow!
So let her keep her black bow.
I don't have to show off in front of Mr. Asano.
Essie. Sit!
You're showing off plenty with the dinner!
What'd you pay for squabs?
I wouldn't be bankrupt.
You know, Bertha, my daughter-in-law. gave me a little whatchamacallit that makes rosettes of radishes and curled up celery and the cucumbers come out like little dolls!
- I'll go and make you some!
- Essie!
Don't go and make. Sit!
You decided on your vacation yet?
Not yet. It's between
Atlantic City and the Virgin Islands.
That's some between.
- Essie. Be calm.
- Hm-hmm.
- And close those doors.
- All right.
Yeah, come in, come in, come in!
Oh, Mr. Asano!
I'm so glad you came.
- Did you have a hard time getting here?
- No. I remember that you instructed me to catch the Lexington Express to Franklin Avenue and then to change to a New Lots train and to debark at Kingston Avenue.
After due consideration, I took a taxi.
I should have suggested that in the first place.
Oh, my apartment.
Please come in.
And excuse the disorder of my house.
Oh. I'd like you to meet my friend,
Mrs. Rubin.
Essie, this is Mr. Asano of Tokyo, Japan.
- I am honored.
- Likewise.
Did you have a nice trip from Japan?
Oh excellent, thank you.
The jets are remarkable planes.
Well, if you'll excuse me,
I gotta go and get dressed.
I'm going over to someone's house for a little potluck
 and then we're gonna watch the late and the late-late.
Every night on television, Mr. Asano, there's an English movie and then there's a picture with Bette Davis.
- I hope you enjoy the films, Mrs. Rubin.
- Oh thank you.
Very pleased to have made your acquaintance, Mr. Asano.
- I hope to have the pleasure again.
- Likewise.
Sayonara!
- She's so flustered meeting you, Mr. Asano.
- It was charming of her to say 'sayonara.'
- It was charming of you to call me.
- It was charming of you to invite me to dinner.
And it was charming...
There must be another way to start a sentence.
Please sit down.
I was so excited when you called ...
I had so many questions to ask
I didn't ask one.
So, what brings you to this neck of the woods?
- A variety of reasons.
- Business?
Only incidentally.
I understand you signed a very nice treaty.
A tentative agreement for a short period.
You will pleased to know that it involved a certain degree of diversification.
- Are you happy with it?
- Not particularly.
But I am particularly happy to see you again.
And I am also happy to see you.
My government has offered me a seat with our delegation to the United Nations.
- I have accepted.
- Congratulations!
So I will be spending a great deal of time here in New York in that great glass building.
That will be very nice.
Mrs. Jacoby ...
I was present at a dinner in Tokyo last week in honor of our former foreign minister.
Your government was represented, along with the ambassador by your son-in-law.
- Did Jerry do well?
- Very well indeed.
He commenced his speech in Japanese.
Not good Japanese but ... Japanese.
Which we all took as a great compliment.
Was my daughter also at the dinner?
Ah yes. Looking lovely in a deep red dress.
Many of my colleagues commented on how attractive she was.
- Her eyes were shining.
- That's because I'm going to be a grandmother.
That is splendid news!
The best new I've ever had.
Now, if you'll excuse me.
I'll just get my dinner in motion.
I won't be a minute.
It's a very handsome samovar.
It belonged to my grandmother.
Is that your grandmother's portrait on the wall?
No, my mother's.
And the other portrait is my father.
This is your husband.
And your son.
Yes.
The son looks like the father,
Isn't it curious?
They both look like you.
I never noticed.
And now, will you sit to my table, please.
Oh don't wait for me, Mr. Asano.
I'll be jumping up and down.
- Just make yourself comfortable.
- I'm very comfortable.
Your house has a warm feeling.
- It's very home-like.
- Thank you.
I hope you like chopped liver.
Thank you.
Excellent.
It tastes like... bean jam buns.
- And what is this, Mrs. Jacoby?
- That's gefilte fish.
It's made from all different kinds of fish, to represent all the oceans and lakes.
We ate it on holidays, the festivals, and Friday nights.
- Oh, I didn't light the candles.
- Can I be of some help?
No. The lady of the house lights the Sabbath candles.
I waited for you. I thought you might like to see how we observe.
I would be most interested.
That's all their is to it.
I just said, "Praised be to thou o Lord our God,
King of the Universe, who has sanctified us by thy commandments and instructed us to light the Sabbath candles. Amen."
Amen.
And now, we have a little blackberry wine.
I do not see my wife in you now, Mrs. Jacoby.
I'm quite recovered from my mourning period.
It takes time, doesn't it?
Of course it takes a little longer for women than for men.
Yes indeed.
I see there are many plays in New York ... and a series of concerts at the Carnegie Hall.
And soon it will be Thanksgiving.
One of your important national events.
I hope we may celebrate it together.
For Thanksgiving, you'll come to my house.
Kampai ...
Mr. Asano.
L'chaim ...
Mrs. Jacoby.
This yacht is bringing a revolutionary
scientific invention to Gotham City.
On a peaceful motor ride,
millionaire Bruce Wayne...
... and his ward, Dick Grayson,
have been summoned to Wayne Manor...
... by an urgent but anonymous
call for help.
The invention and its custodian
are reported in grave danger...
... aboard the yacht.
Never ones
to shirk responsibility...
... Bruce and Dick, with
characteristic speed and resolve...
... descend promptly to the Batcave.
And then, as they have done
many times before...
... as Batman and Robin,
courageous warriors against crime...
... they are off, once again,
to the rescue.
Batteries to power.
Turbines to speed.
Roger. Ready to move out.
Batmobile to airport, red alert.
Prepare Batcopter for takeoff.
Batmobile approaching.
Red Alert! Gotham Tower to all
aircraft in the control zone.
Enter your holding pattern.
Batcopter cleared for takeoff.
It's good to know they're up there doing their job.
Batdrift angle: 03 to starboard.
Roger. Correcting to port.
Altitude: 317. Sink rate: 0.49.
- Drop Bat ladder.
- Bat ladder away.
Lock computer on afterdeck.
Set automatic Bathold.
Watch out. This could be tricky.
Have no fear. I'll keep all my wits about me. So long, for a minute.
Batman to Robin, ease off on the power!
Increase sink rate!
Roger! Wilco!
Take her up!
Holy sardine!
Hand me down the shark-repellent Bat spray!
- Enough pictures.
- This press conference must be brief.
- You're lucky they'll talk to you.
- Mr. Merrick of The Gotham City Times.
A yacht approaching the city is said to have disappeared.
- Nonsense. How can a yacht disappear?
- It isn't true?
I stand on my answer.
Mr. Stanley of The Globe.
This yacht belonged to the famous Big Ben Distilleries.
Isn't the proprietor,
Commodore Schmidlapp...
...bringing a new invention from Big Ben's lab?
- No more questions about that ship.
- What about that shark?
An unfortunate animal who chanced to swallow a floating mine.
I wouldn't worry about that.
You there, Miss...
Comrade Kitanya Irenya Tatanya
Karenska Alisoff.
From The Moscow Bugle.
You grace us with your presence.
May I be of service?
Please, take off the mask to give the better picture.
- Batman take off his mask?
- The woman must be mad.
Please, Chief O'Hara, all of you.
This young lady is a stranger.
Her request is not unnatural...
...however, impossible to grant.
- Impossible?
- Indeed.
If we were to remove our masks, our true identities would be revealed.
- Ruining their value as crime fighters.
- Not even we know who they are.
In fact, our own relatives don't know.
But your so curious costumes...
Don't be put off by them.
Under this we're ordinary Americans.
You're like the masked vigilantes in the Westerns?
Batman and Robin are deputized agents of the law!
- "Support your police" is our message.
- Well said, Robin.
And no better way to end this conference.
- Thank you and good day.
- Batman...
Never mind, everybody out.
Come on, we're all busy here.
A fine job. You allayed their fears.
If I'd told the truth, panic would grip the city.
The truth. And what is the truth?
A decoy. An anonymous warning...
...that Schmidlapp's in danger, to lure me into a trap.
An attempt on his life.
While they were luring you to a watery grave...
...the yacht was being hijacked?
- Precisely!
- And who behind it?
What known super criminals are at large now?
I'll check at once, Batman.
Let's have the latest status report on criminals at large. Thank you.
Coming up on the closed-circuit TV screen.
Status report. Known super criminals
not currently imprisoned.
The Penguin.
That pompous waddling master of foul play.
- The Joker!
- Devilish clown prince of crime!
If I had a nickel for every time he baffled us!
The Riddler loose too?
So it seems.
To plague us with his conundrums.
- Gosh, and the Catwoman!
- End of status report.
Could be any one of them, but which one?
Which ones?
Pretty fishy what happened to me on that ladder.
- Where there's a fish, there's Penguin.
- Wait! It happened at sea.
See? "C" for Catwoman!
Yet, that exploding shark was pulling my leg.
- The Joker!
- It all adds up to a sinister riddle.
Riddle-er. Riddler?
A thought strikes me.
So dreadful I scarcely dare give it utterance.
The four of them.
Their forces combined.
- Holy nightmare!
- Batman, could it be?
I don't know.
But I think I know where to find a clue.
Robin, to the Batcave!
We haven't one moment to lose!
Ahoy, Catwoman.
How many times have I told you?
Never use my real name in public!
You and your trained exploding shark!
How should I know they'd have a can...
...of shark-repellent Bat spray?
You sniveling sardine!
You pompous puffed-up penguin!
Friends, make peace.
Have a shake on me.
A joke a day keeps the gloom away!
Sic them, Hecate, scratch out their eyes.
- Take away that ravenous panther!
- I'll feed him to the birds.
I'll incapacitate it with my trick confetti!
"United Underworld."
We're about as united...
...as the members of the United World headquarters.
- What's the matter with you all?
- She's right.
If we don't manage to swallow our super-criminal pride...
Right, Mr. Riddler, quite right!
We must hang together, or we shall hang separately.
What a pity that would be on the eve of the greatest criminal coup ever!
- How did it go, Catwoman?
- Purr-fectly. Purr-fectly.
In my disguise as Kitka,
I penetrated their press conference.
- The fools are completely baffled.
- But undrowned.
Yes, unfortunately.
Batman's boots didn't even look damp!
Our prisoner still doesn't know he's kidnapped?
He hasn't the foggiest.
He just keeps ringing for his tea.
- There he goes again.
- Take it to him, man.
Come in.
Your tea, commodore.
Thank you, steward.
Good service aboard this yacht.
We strive to give satisfaction, sir.
Your face has the most ghastly pallor.
Are you getting enough sea air?
My duties keep me mostly undercover.
Too bad, too bad.
How much longer will this yacht be fogbound off the Grand Banks?
I couldn't say, sir.
Well, gives me a chance to catch up on my Dickens.
Still, I'd like to get to Gotham City.
I've a clever invention with me, stored in the hold.
Should be worth millions of dollars, pip-pip!
Well, pip-pip to you, sir! If you wish anything further, just ring!
Schmidlapp's invention in our hands...
...the whole world almost literally in our grasp!
And Batman and Robin still alive to block us.
Everything pip-pip with the prisoner!
He hasn't a clue.
- I bet the Dynamic Duo has.
- What?
A clue on how we made that ship disappear.
- And when they solve it...
- They'll be out to investigate.
But we'll be there first.
If we hurry, that is.
Catwoman, you tend to this headquarters.
- Attention, you unfathomable finks!
- Yo-ho!
Call down to our secret river-bottom dock.
- Prepare our submarine for sea.
- Yo-ho!
- Yo-ho what?
- Sir!
Holy Merlin magician!
Get set for a shock.
The Batcamera was aimed at the yacht.
- My strange hunch was right.
- I don't get it...
Think! As you remarked, no one can make...
...a seagoing vessel simply disappear.
Provided it was ever really there at all.
- You mean...?
- Precisely!
The yacht we thought we saw was a mere illusion.
A tricky projection akin to the common desert mirage.
It deceived our naked eyes...
...but was blocked by the Batcamera's Batfilter!
I know where that projection came from.
- Observe that bell buoy.
- What about it?
The coordinates of our position were 10.3 by 69-B.
Feed those figures into the navigational aid computer.
No legal bell buoy at that position.
As I surmised, an illegal projection buoy cleverly camouflaged.
Maybe the crooks left fingerprints!
Good thinking, let's find out.
To the Batboat, fast!
One thing I don't dig, Batman.
If that ship was a mirage, where's the real one?
Taken to some secret island hideaway with every soul aboard, save one.
- Commodore Schmidlapp?
- Precisely.
For some reason the hijackers needed him...
...or his invention as part of their criminal scheme.
Keep an eye on the scope.
Watch for suspicious vessels.
It looks like we've got the whole ocean to ourselves.
Diving planes, Mr. Bluebeard, three degrees.
Hoist three degrees.
I hope you know what you're doing, Penguin.
Mr. Riddler, I ignore your insipid insinuation, sir!
Mr. Joker, you're leaning on the control!
Don't sound so bossy, if you please!
As the poet says:
"On land, you may command.
At sea, it is me!"
Now hear this. This is your captain speaking, my fine pinioned pirates.
We're approaching the buoy.
There may be skullduggery ahead!
- Yo-ho!
- What? What?
Unidentified small craft, bearing 113.
Mr. Bluebeard, hold her steady!
Up periscope!
Great quivering icebergs!
Just as I hoped.
Watch your step.
An underwater shark cage.
The source of that fish.
What cruelty!
Stuffing a poor shark with deadly TNT!
Nothing's sacred to those devils.
Torpedoes! What are we waiting for?
Chain of command, Mr. Riddler.
The Penguin runs the ship.
Now hear this, Mr. Joker.
Load the torpedo tubes!
Load torpedo tubes!
Salt and corrosion.
The infamous old enemies of the crime fighter. No prints here.
Look here, Batman.
That tricky mirage projector must be behind this plate.
Wow! What a set of superpower lenses!
No wonder we were fooled.
Look, Robin.
Holy Long John Silver!
A pirate periscope!
He spotted us! Set torpedoes to automatic homing.
Set torpedoes to automatic homing!
You crazy bird.
Fire them off, quickly!
Activate the remote control
Penguin magnet inside that buoy.
Holy glue pot! What's going on?
The fiends! They've converted this buoy into a gigantic magnet!
It's got us by the metallic objects in our utility belts.
Torpedo tubes armed!
Batman! We're helpless in this monstrous, invisible grip!
- Steady, Robin. I see one hope.
- What, Batman?
If I could just pry loose my utility belt transmitter!
- Mr. Joker, are you ready to fire?
- Yo-ho, ready to fire!
Five, four, three, two.
- Fire 1!
- Fire 1!
Torpedoes!
If I can just reverse the polarity, send out waves of super energy.
- What happened?
- Mr. Joker, fire 2!
Fire 2!
Here comes another one!
You and your reconditioned surplus torpedoes!
He must be using a super energy reverse polarizer! Mr. Joker, fire 3!
Fire 3!
Here comes a third one!
Confound it, the batteries are dead!
This one's getting through!
It is. It's getting through.
Surface, Mr. Bluebeard!
Let us feast our eyes on the watery remains!
Gosh, the nobility of the almost-human porpoise.
True, Robin.
It was noble of that animal...
...to hurl himself into the path of that torpedo.
He gave his life for ours.
Operator, give me the Pentagon,
Navy department.
Too bad.
Admiral Fangschliester's office.
Hello, Batman speaking.
- Who is it?
- Batman.
Oh, Batman.
Hello, Batman. Ahoy!
What can I do for you?
Hello, admiral.
A routine question.
Have you recently sold surplus submarines? If so, to whom?
Just a moment,
I'll have to look that up.
Keep practicing.
Answer: Affirmative. We disposed of a surplus submarine on Friday.
A pre-atomic model.
To some chap named P.N. Gwynne.
- P.N. Gwynne?
- The Penguin!
Did this P.N. Gwynne leave an address?
Just a post office box number.
Would you like it?
No, thank you, admiral.
You've been very helpful.
Your tone sounds grim.
We haven't done anything foolish?
Disposing of submarines to persons who don't even leave their addresses?
- Good day, admiral.
- Gosh!
The Penguin in command of a pre-atomic submarine!
- Grave situation, Robin.
- If only we knew what he was up to!
Holy Polaris!
From that submarine, no doubt.
That missile, it's written something.
A riddle, in the form of a joke!
Let's race back to headquarters.
You know what this means, don't you?
Our fear is confirmed. Penguin,
Joker, Riddler, their forces combined.
- Heaven only knows the objective!
- It may be worse.
- Saints alive, how can that be?
- Look at this pair of riddles.
"What does a turkey do when he flies upside down?"
- He gobbles up.
- And number two.
"What weighs 6 ounces, sits in a tree and is dangerous?"
- A sparrow with a machine gun.
- Of course.
Now, combine both answers.
What kind of creature would gobble up a bird in a tree?
Heaven protect us, a cat!
Yes, the criminal catalyst in this entire affair...
...our old archenemy, Catwoman.
Penguin, Joker, Riddler and Catwoman too!
The sum of the angles of that rectangle is monstrous.
We've been given warning.
They work to take over...
- Gotham City?
- Any two of them might try that!
- The whole country?
- If it were three, I'd say yes.
But four?
Their minimum objective must be...
...the entire world.
The United World building, dear comrades in crime.
Our objective, the Security Council.
Sitting like fat birds in a tree just waiting to be snatched.
And you bungled it!
The Dynamic Duo escaped our trap!
Passing porpoises which intercept torpedoes!
There ought to be a piscatorial statute!
Time is short! We've got to get Batman before he gets us.
I could lure him into a giant exploding octopus...
After one of your fishy explosions, they're still in one piece.
I suppose they'll be broken up by your moldy jokes!
Shut up, all of you!
I see the way to do it.
We'll play each of our treacherous trumps in one hand.
And we'll do it right here!
- How?
- How?
The end.
The end of...
We shall spring them from the Joker's jack-in-the-box...
...through that window, out over the sea...
...and into the waiting arms of the Penguin's exploding octopus!
The trigger? One of my riddles.
And the bait? You, Catwoman.
You're mad.
The minute Batman spots her...
...he'll bop her with a Batarang.
You don't understand.
She will be disguised as Kitka.
And as Kitka, she shall lure some millionaire into a kidnap trap.
Of course!
With a clever clue pointing here.
- Batman will race to the rescue.
- Capital!
But who are we going to kidnap?
I know the perfect victim.
I know the perfect victim! I know!
Bruce Wayne, the millionaire head...
...of that disgusting do-gooding
Wayne Foundation.
Delicious! Just the sort of square citizen Batman will dash to rescue.
- Then snap!
- Into the combination trap.
Purr-fect, Riddler, purr-fect.
Comrade Wayne? My name is Kitanya
Irenya Tatanya Karenska Alisoff.
I'm from The Moscow Bugle.
My friends call me Kitka.
Kitka. Kitka, a charming acronym.
Thank you, Comrade Wayne.
The Wayne Foundation is known from Leningrad to Kamchatka.
It works for peace and understanding.
Your picture has appeared countless times in The Moscow Bugle.
I'm most grateful,
I wasn't aware of that.
You found these riddles on Wayne
Foundation stationery under your door?
Yes, Comrade Wayne.
That's why I brought them to you.
I thought it was some foolishness, then I remembered:
Is there not a bourgeois criminal cad...
...the Riddler, who preys upon the workers?
Your jargon is quaint, Miss Kitka.
But there is such a creature.
What do we do now? Report these riddles to your police...
...or perhaps to that Cossack Batman?
That's hardly necessary at the moment.
Doubtless it's the work of some harmless crank.
Nevertheless, shall we give this matter further consideration...
...over dinner tonight?
What a purr-fectly lovely idea.
I'll telephone to cancel a previous engagement.
Alfred will see you to the door.
Do vechera.
Do vechera, Comrade Wayne.
Alfred, see Miss Kitka out, please.
Meet me in the Batcave. Emergency.
Very good, sir.
Listen to these riddles.
Tell me if you interpret them as I do.
- "What has yellow skin and writes?"
- A ballpoint banana.
Right. "What people are always in a hurry?"
Rushing people? Russians!
Right again.
What would you say they mean?
Banana, Russian...
A Russian will slip on a banana peel and break their neck!
Precisely, the only possible meaning.
- A clear threat to Miss Kitka's life.
- Who?
Miss Kitka, the charming Russian journalist for The Moscow Bugle.
In some way she must have unwittingly stumbled on the criminals' plot!
What is the scheme?
Tonight Bruce Wayne will go out on the town with Miss Kitka.
- A not displeasing chore.
- Indeed.
I've rarely met a girl...
...who's a potent argument in favor of international relations.
You will dog our footsteps in the Batmobile.
You'll keep watch via the Batscanner.
- If the Riddler tries to make good...
- I'll bash him brutally.
Then we close in with the police.
- Got your driver's license?
- In my wallet.
Good man. Drive carefully. Good luck!
This may be a memorable night.
This curtain which separates our countries is so foolish.
If we could just contrive...
...some way of getting more deeply involved with each other.
Da, we must search for such a method.
It's wrong to listen to this.
Some things have to be private, even for a crime fighter.
Your discretion is admirable,
Master Robin, yes.
- Time for another check-in.
- Roger.
- Commissioner.
- Yes?
- Yes, Boy Wonder.
- Batmobile position:
Gotham Park, proceeding south on West Drive.
About to pass
Benedict Arnold monument.
Still in the park? It's been almost an hour. What are they doing?
No comment, commissioner. Let's just say, no sign of criminal activity.
Yes, I understand.
I've just thought of a clever ruse.
Have Chief O'Hara flash the Batsignal.
If you say so, but why?
The crooks will think we're racing to headquarters.
Thinking we're out of the way, they might strike at Miss Kitka!
Devilishly clever!
- Thank you. Batmobile over and out.
- Right.
- Chief O'Hara, flash the Batsignal.
- Yes, sir.
Shades of Smolensk, what is that?
Incredible, I don't...
- Of course! How clever.
- Clever, Comrade Wayne?
I mean, clever device, Miss Kitka.
It's the Batsignal, from the roof of police headquarters.
Batman must be racing there in response.
Then you did get the police to call them in for my protection.
Yes, yes.
How purr-fectly wonderful of you!
I close my eyes and I dream of those savage Cossacks...
...racing over the steps on their mission.
How strange.
I close my eyes, and I dream of something...
...quite astonishingly different.
Keep your eyes closed.
Continue with this dream.
The dream continues.
It approaches a climax.
Not so fast. Be more slow.
Miss Kitka?
May I see you home to that penthouse apartment?
- He swallowed the Catbait!
- And now to make him Batbait.
Finks, Morgan, Bluebeard, Quetch, the jetpack umbrellas!
I'll slip into something more comfortable...
...while your cocoa is warming.
Is that prudent?
Our instructions were to keep watch.
I don't know about prudent.
But it's the only decent thing to do.
Perhaps. Yes, yes.
There it is, 73rd Street and Concord Avenue.
Follow me down to the terrace.
And all my days are trances
And all my nightly dreams
Are where thy dark eye glances
And where thy footstep gleams
Edgar Allan Poe, Miss Kitka.
"To One in Paradise," first stanza.
About that dream you had...
- Do we dare?
- Why not?
Yes, of course. Why not?
Of what use is a dream if not a blueprint for courageous action?
Into action, comrade.
Miss Kitka,
I have the strangest feeling...
...that I am about to be utterly and madly carried away.
- This is a kidnapping!
- Our joke's on you!
You filthy criminals!
- Much as one deplores indiscretion...
- Right.
I'll just take one tiny, tiny peek.
- Holy demolition!
- Bless my dustpan!
Cover the exits.
I'll race up with my Batrope!
Holy Halloween!
Strange, Batman should've been here hours ago.
Maybe you didn't leave a clear enough clue.
I did! I can't understand why
Batman hasn't dashed into our trap.
He puts his foot here, my secret jack-in-the-box fires...
...shooting him over the sea...
...into the waiting arms of Penguin's exploding octopus.
What a deliciously humorous trajectory!
And nothing to link us with the crime.
You abominable outlaws!
What have you done with Miss Kitka?
She's quite well, Mr. Wayne.
I swear by heaven, if you've harmed that girl...
...I'll kill you all.
I'll rend you limb from limb!
Mr. Wayne, must you be so impulsive?
Where is she?
Show me Miss Kitka...
...or I'll wreck this place with my dying breath!
Blindfold the captive.
Lead him down the labyrinthine path to chamber 17.
Two minutes, no more.
- Turn on the secret microphone.
- Quiet, quiet!
- Miss Kitka.
- Comrade Wayne.
Are you all right?
I'll curse myself forever.
This nasty soup we're in is of my brewing.
If I hadn't let your beauty lull me off guard...
Off guard, comrade?
There are some things
I cannot disclose.
But we're in the hands of the most vicious foursome.
I fear we have nothing
to look forward to but death.
It may not be that black,
Comrade Wayne.
Batman and Robin are probably hot on our trail.
From something
I happened to overhear...
... I think we are merely
bait for Batman.
Once he's in their trap,
we'll be released.
A slender hope, Miss Kitka.
More slender than you can know.
You do not think
Batman will get here?
That I cannot say.
Did you overhear any mention...
...of any other prisoner of this rotten gang?
No, I did not.
Who on earth could you mean?
Commodore Schmidlapp ringing for his tea.
Just a thought, it doesn't matter.
Speedy escape is our only hope.
A moment, while I think...
Why didn 't I think of it sooner?
Of what?
Up my sleeve I have a radio transmitter strapped above my elbow.
- What a curious device to carry.
- Not at all.
Capitalists who carry a lot of money have safety contrivances.
If I can just get at it...
Wiggle around back-to-back.
Maybe you can reach it with your fingers.
Let's get him.
There we are.
You think you're pretty clever, don't you?
- Clever enough to outwit you.
- We'll see about that.
Dear colleagues, let's see what's strapped above his left elbow.
Cretinous creatures!
I knew you'd been listening in!
I told you that fish story about a radio...
Get him!
Miss Kitka! Where are you?
- Great day!
- Hello, commissioner.
Dick, we're late for that demonstration. Excuse us.
But you can't dash off now.
How did you escape?
- With the aid of Batman.
- Thank goodness for the Caped Crusader.
Return to police headquarters.
He may wish to call you.
My fine finkish friends, you have heard my astounding proposal.
What do you say?
What do you say?!
Our strike cannot be postponed.
We're at the mercy of the Gotham River tide.
It's now or never to get through the channel.
Batman will never come here now.
But the police will, any instant.
So, to the Penguin's princely plan.
Is it yes or no?
It's crazy, but let's try it.
We have to get Batman out of the way.
Oh, go ahead, Penguin.
Would you drop one of your dream pills into Commodore Schmidlapp's tea?
- Presto!
- Then carry him to the submarine!
Mr. Riddler, will you tell Mr. Quetch...
...to fetch the five guinea pigs?
Fetch the guinea pigs.
Yo-ho-ho, sir!
Now, my fine fishy finks...
...you see the commodore's pièce de "no-résistance"...
...an instant whiskey maker.
Waiting for us to put it to more universal use.
Don't be afraid.
You'll feel nothing.
I am merely going to temporarily extract...
...every bit of moisture from your bodies!
It's a painless operation.
- Delightful!
- Dehydrated!
Catwoman, will you get a dustpan...
...and put every one of them very carefully into separate vials?
Mr. Riddler, would you prepare the submarine to get underway...
...while I prepare a terrifying demolition charge for the police?
- Where do we meet?
- United World building.
Gotham River.
39th floor. The elevator.
- One hour?
- One hour.
What criminal genius, Catwoman!
Who but a genius could conceive such an audacious plot?
To trick Batman and Robin into inviting me to their Batcave...
...with five dehydrated death-dealing pirates at my command.
Careful, careful.
Every one of them has a mother.
Out, Batarang and Batrope.
Stand clear.
With people in weird outfits like the supercrooks around here...
...it's amazing no one reports this place to the police!
It's a low neighborhood, full of rum pots.
They attribute curious sights to alcoholic delusions.
Drink is a filthy thing.
I'd rather be dead than unable to trust my own eyes.
Yes, honey. There was someone walking up the wall.
Ready with super-blinding Batpellets.
- Away, Robin. Away!
- But...
Come on, Batman.
Batman!
Miss Kitka!
Quick, everyone!
Flee for your lives! Into the street!
Some days you just can't get rid of a bomb.
- It's all right.
- Holy heart failure!
I was able to dispose of that bomb just in time...
...and shield myself behind these iron pipes.
You risked your life to save that riffraff in the bar?
They may be drinkers, but they're also human beings...
...and may be salvaged.
I had to do it!
But we lost the trail of Miss Kitka.
Stranded without a clue!
Ahoy there! Could you chaps direct me to a policeman?
Commodore Schmidlapp's the name.
Big Ben Distilleries, you know.
- Holy costume party. The Penguin!
- Obviously.
What's his game?
- What's your game, Penguin?
- Penguin?
No, my name's Schmidlapp, old boy, Schmidlapp.
Your fingerprints will settle that hash.
We'll check them against our mobile anti-crime file in our Batmobile.
Let's see your hands.
Looks like plastic-coated fingertips!
Yes, I scorched myself pressing a waistcoat.
I do believe the attending surgeon did use plastic, yes.
It looks bad.
This brassy bird has us buffaloed.
Not quite.
There's one method of identification no one can evade.
Retinal eye patterns?
He's right. The pattern of blood vessels...
...in the retina, as individual as a fingerprint.
Don't you have an anti-criminal, eye-pattern master file...
...in your Batcave?
Why don't you take me there?
- You'll submit yourself to a test?
- It might be an amusing experience.
Stand by to catch him, Robin.
I'll give him the Batgas.
What? Batgas?
An anesthetic, necessary to prevent you from seeing...
...the entrance to the Batcave.
If anyone knew that, they could pierce the secret of our identities.
Ready, commodore?
Oh, I say, what deucedly strange customs you colonials have!
Well, I'm ready.
To the Batmobile.
This could be our break.
- I wonder why he let us take him?
- We'll soon know.
- I've got the eye checker.
- Stay on the alert.
After I give him the Batwake, we must be ready for anything.
Oh, it's you.
We're here, eh? I see.
Oh, what's this? Oh, say!
This is extraordinary!
It's absolutely extraordinary!
I must say that your laboratory exceeds the limits...
...of man's wildest imagination.
Could I trouble you for a glass of water?
Your Batgas has left me with a parched sensation.
The water dispenser is clearly marked.
All right, thank you.
Thank you, sir.
Help yourself, commodore.
Slake your thirst.
You'll have worse than a parched sensation when we're through.
Perhaps, perhaps. But I am appalled by your attitude, sir.
Condemning me before the facts have been authoritatively established!
You are abrogating my constitutional rights, sir.
All set, Batman.
Come on, Penguin.
Time to rip off your false feathers.
Coming, Batman.
I'm coming at once.
Holy hallucination!
I wish it were, but it's five dehydrated pirates, rehydrated!
At them, me hearties!
Shiver them from stem to stern!
Attack them, you faltering fink!
They're gone! Popped like balloons.
How did it happen?
Whoever dehydrated those pirates...
...couldn't have foreseen their rehydration with the heavy water...
...we use to recharge the atomic pile!
It left them in an unstable condition!
You saw it yourself. The slightest impact was sufficient...
...to instantly reduce them to antimatter.
Antimatter?
You mean, they won't be coming back?
No, Robin. Not in this universe.
Let that be a lesson in the dangers...
...of tampering with the laws of Mother Nature.
My apologies, commodore.
I've done you a cruel injustice.
- You have?
- You were duped. Brainwashed.
The criminals planted those dehydrated thugs on you.
You were obviously under the influence...
...of post-hypnotic suggestion when you rehydrated them.
Come on down, commodore.
Another sniff of Batgas, and we'll all return to the city.
Are you sure you didn't hurt your head?
Perfectly. Swallow this pill.
Now, give our friend here a whiff of Batwake.
Good morning.
What's wrong?
Manifold pressure's dropping.
We'd better stop and check it.
- Sorry about that. Won't take long.
- Yes, you will!
And away we go in my Birdmobile!
One side kick for a sailor.
- You okay?
- Thanks to that anti-Penguin gas pill!
He's played right into our hands.
Via Batcycle to the Batcopter!
We'll track him to the gang's new hideout.
Disengage go-cart.
Batscanner tracking the stolen Batmobile.
Port two degrees, then steady as she goes!
Yo-ho, port two degrees!
We're almost there!
- Where are you going?
- To fire off more riddling clues.
Riddler! You're mad!
Penguin's finished Batman by now.
That miserable, waddling mountebank of a bird!
He couldn't finish a bag of popcorn!
Say Penguin failed. All the more reason not to hand them clues.
But I must! Outwitting Batman is my sole delight...
...my joy, my heaven on earth, my very paradise.
Riddler, come back!
Stolen Batmobile turning, heading up Gotham River Drive.
Polaris-type missile coming right for us!
Hold on! This may be tricky.
- Damage?
- The tail rotor's disengaged.
Brace yourself, Robin, we're going down.
This could be the end.
Now, to find my riddling
Polaris skywriter!
Look! Look, the Dynamic Duo!
I got them. I got them.
Holy horseshoe!
Some luck, landing on top of foam rubber!
The odds against it would make even the most reckless gambler cringe.
True, I did think I'd spotted it out of the corner of my eye, but...
That crazy missile wrote two more riddles.
"What goes up white and comes down yellow and white?"
An egg!
"How do you divide 17 apples among 16 people?"
Make applesauce.
Apples into applesauce.
A unification into one smooth mixture.
An egg, nature's perfect container.
The container of our future hopes.
A unification in a container of hope?
United World Organization!
Precisely!
And the Security Council meets today.
- If what I fear is true...
- Let's commandeer a taxi.
No, not at this time of day.
Luckily we're in tip-top condition.
It'll be faster if we run. Let's go!
We are now passing through the grotto.
- Depth, a half-fathom.
- Engines, dead slow astern.
Dead slow astern.
As the blueprint said, an abandoned construction elevator.
Hecate, sniff out the weak spot.
- I hope Penguin made it.
- Who needs him?
Stand back.
Hey! Can't you read?
A fine day for penguins.
My co-conspirators, we meet as planned.
No thanks to you, the Dynamic Duo has been silenced forever.
Blasted out of the sky by a coincidence!
The delicious irony of it!
Downed by Riddler's Polaris skywriter.
Happy happenstance! Hold your breath till we cross the hall.
There are still lingering traces of my finely filtered Penguin gas.
Holy marathon! I'm getting a stitch!
Let's hope it's a stitch in time that saves nine.
The nine members of the Security Council.
It is the opinion of Her Majesty that we pursue peace at all costs.
Our poor united world in microcosm.
I'm afraid they'll find our humor very, very dry.
We understand your position, but for peace...
It has always been our policy...
Quickly now!
Each one in a separate vial.
And, boys, don't anybody sneeze.
- Seal the building!
- Turn off the ventilating system!
The Security Council may have been dehydrated!
Emergency, operator.
Get me security.
Emergency, operator, emergency!
Up, up, up, up!
- Surrender! You criminals!
- The United Underworld is through!
What's this, an apparition?
One false move, and you'll find out.
We'll hurl our Batarangs!
- To the elevator!
- Catwoman! Stop, I said!
I don't think you mean that.
Miss Kitka dies if you take one more step! Go!
This way, Robin!
The Security Council, gone!
What a fiendishly clever way to abduct nine men...
...from a heavily guarded building!
Where does that elevator go?
Downstairs, to an abandoned submarine dock on the river.
Holy Captain Nemo! They'll head for sea by way of Short Island Sound.
We have just one trump card left.
Heaven help the world if we fail.
Come on!
Down periscope.
We're over the last bar.
Mr. Bluebeard, all engines full ahead.
Yo-ho, all engines full ahead!
What a delightful haul!
Mr. Riddler, will you prepare those nine radio ransom messages?
And no stupid riddles.
Make those messages plain.
One billion dollars cash, from each country.
Precisely! To be delivered to our secret island...
...by the horde of trained carrier pigeons which I shall provide.
No whimsical embellishments.
Make those messages clear!
Make those messages clear!
It's like a dream, Pengy-sweet.
Nothing can stop us now.
Sonar contact.
Range 8000. Bearing 181.
Yo-ho, sonar contact.
Small craft at 7500, bearing 01.
Small craft?
It's moving fast.
Range is down to 7000.
- The Batboat!
- Drat that cockleshell!
Mr. Bluebeard, steady on the diving planes.
I'll man the torpedo tubes.
Would you fire a surface-to-surface underwater homing missile?
Missile ahoy!
It has a homing device in its nose cone. Take evasive action.
No use. It's tracking us!
Take my Batradio.
I looked it up this morning.
That class of missile receives on a wavelength of 164. 1.
- Quickly! Send a jamming signal.
It's starting down.
Farewell, Batman!
Farewell, Dynamic Duo!
Holy bikini, that was close!
Yo-ho, small craft still closing.
Range 4000. Bearing 88.
They know how to jam our missiles.
Up to periscope depth!
Yo-ho, up to periscope depth.
- Range 3500.
- Get the Batcharge launcher.
Roger!
They hold nine of the world's most eminent men in dehydrated condition.
Our task is not to sink that sub, merely to drive it to the surface.
Forward torpedo tubes, prepare to fire.
Yo-ho! Forward torpedo tubes, prepare to fire.
Five, four, three, two...
...torpedoes, fire!
Torpedoes, fire!
Torpedoes away!
- Dive, Mr. Bluebeard, dive!
- Yo-ho, dive.
Down periscope.
Torpedo off the port bow!
Prepare to fire Batcharges in front of torpedoes.
That's too soon!
It must be Batcharges!
And that means there'll be more of the dread things meant for us!
You dismal bird!
You and your submarine!
Shut up, you feline floozy!
Mr. Bluebeard, down 30 fathoms.
Run silent, run deep.
They're diving, silent engines.
I'll circle them at full-thrust speed, diminishing radius of curvature.
Roger.
What's their bearing?
- I don't know, sir.
- You don't know?
It's changing every second.
They must be circling us.
Fire when ready.
I'll maintain curvature.
Yo-ho! Compartments A, B and C taking in water, sir!
Penguin, you know I can't take water!
You cowardly kitten, you want to live forever?
- This bird has flown around the bend!
- To cuckooland!
Riddler, Joker, do something!
We weren't meant for a watery grave!
Now hear this! Now hear this!
Blow all tanks! Surface! Surface!
Cut the Batcharges.
They've had enough, I imagine.
They're surfacing fast.
- Estimated surfacing position?
- 200 yards.
Here they come.
Diminishing speed. Ready to board.
Roger.
Pirates! To arms!
Prepare to repel boarders!
Strike your colors!
We have not yet begun to fight!
Attack!
Bon voyage, pussy.
Holy heartbreak! Miss Kitka!
Batman, I...
Say no more, Robin.
It could be compromising.
Of course.
It's just one of those things in the life of every crime fighter.
It means nothing.
Snap on the Batcuffs.
Batman to coast guard.
There's a submarine two miles east of Sandy Nose.
It's filled with human jetsam.
Come, take it in tow.
Robin. Over here, look.
The hope of the world, tottering on the brink!
Holy almost!
To think, it might have been shattered before our very eyes.
- Up, Catwoman.
- The service here has gone to pot.
What the devil is this?
The captain's costume party?
Holy jumble!
Where's the hope of the world now?
Batcentrifuge at 32,000 rpm.
Increase angstrom force in vector X.
Vector X up one notch.
- Yes, commissioner?
- What progress? Is there hope?
There's always hope.
But do you think you and Robin can separate that mingled dust...
...back into its constituent members?
With all modesty, commissioner...
...if we can't, heaven knows who can.
Truer words were never spoken.
Howdy, you all.
How are those boys doing up there?
Batman says there's hope,
Mr. President. What more can one ask?
The free world is waiting. Tell Batman
I salute him and wish him luck.
I needn 't tell you
with whom I have just spoken.
Ready for separation.
All right.
I'll activate the computer link.
Input the ethnic and national factors.
- Batman, wait a minute!
- What?
Well, with the way the world is and all...
...maybe we ought to try to improve those factors?
- Reshuffle them a little.
- No.
It's not for us to tamper with the laws of nature.
In this very Batcave, you saw a ghastly example...
...of what happens when one tries to do that.
Gosh, yes.
When you put it that way...
Here we go.
Separation accomplished.
Ready to rehydrate.
Separation accomplished.
They are ready to rehydrate.
We are ready to rehydrate.
They are ready to rehydrate.
A solemn moment, gentlemen.
One of dedication and humble supplication.
Robin, prepare to rehydrate.
Ready to rehydrate.
Turn on the water faucet.
Success! Success!
They've done it!
They've done it!
Success, success!
We've done it, we've done it!
Success! Success!
What the...?
In the interest of peace, you must hear me out!
Gentlemen, it is imperative that we limit our conversation to peace.
Who knows, Robin?
This strange mixing of minds...
...may be the greatest single service ever performed for humanity.
Let's go, but inconspicuously.
Through the window.
We'll use our Batropes.
Our job is finished.

Help!
Get us out of here!
Help!
Help! Get us out of here!
We're trapped.
(screams)
Somebody get us out! Help!
(splintering)
What happened?
- She's hit something.
- Have mercy.
I can't get it open. It's jammed.
You first, Fritz.
(grunts)
Ernst, help your mother.
Captain Wilhelm? Anybody here?
Anyone there, Fritz?
If anybody was here, they'd have heard us long before this.
As I said, if they've abandoned the ship, they've got no claim.
It's ours, by maritime law.
They wouldn't leave us here.
Something must have happened.
They thought the ship was going to sink. It was every man for himself.
It was carrying too much sail. The captain and the mate argued about it.
I'd have fought the pirates instead of running into the storm.
Alright, Mother.
What a mess!
- At least we're not far from land.
- Then there's hope.
Maybe when we get to shore we can get help. Make her sail again.
She'll never sail again.
We could build a raft.
We've got enough wood.
Fritz is right.
The sooner we get ashore, the better.
Look what I found!
(cow moos)
- Look.
- Those poor things!
They must have had a worse time than we did.
How's it look?
Are we solid on the rocks?
I don't know. No, I'd say we're here until the turning of the tide.
Help me, somebody! Help!
(barking)
No!
Look what I found. The captain's dogs. And are they glad to see me!
- He's alright.
- Better make a start. Come on.
Give me a hand.
If it's deserted I can work out where we are when I learn how to use this.
Alright, take it along.
(organ plays)
- It still works!
- There's no time for that.
- Let's put up a distress flag.
- We don't look distressed enough?
Anyone who sees a ship stuck on the rocks might guess it's in trouble.
Now, you look after them, Turk.
You too, Duke.
- How can we take all these animals?
- We're not taking them.
- If we leave them they'll die!
- When we're safe on land then you can talk to me about the animals. Not before.
Francis, get them out of there!
We don't want this one or that.
- Wait a minute!
- Or that. We don't want any of them.
Right, Fritz.
Put it over your head. That's it.
- Alright, I'm fine.
- Grip the rope here.
- Alright?
- Come on, Mother. We'll catch you.
- Don't worry.
- Right, Fritz.
- Come on.
- Now.
- Sorry, Mother.
- Are you alright?
(dog moans)
Fritz, the dogs!
He forgot the dogs.
They're not coming. Cast off.
They're my dogs! I found them!
Sit down. They weigh more than any of us. We'd sink in no time.
Alright, Fritz? Right.
Watch that wreckage.
(dog barks)
The dogs are going to swim it.
Come on, Duke. Come on, Turk.
You can make it. Keep swimming.
Straight between those rocks.
That side.
No, come and help me push over here.
Come on, boys, you can make it!
Keep swimming.
- Watch those rocks.
- Your side, Ernst. Push off!
Come on, Turk! Come on, Duke!
Look out!
Do something. They'll drown!
We can't take any more chances.
Look!
(barking)
Come on, boy.
(barking)
- Good boy, Turk. Well done.
- Keep them in the middle.
- That's right. In the centre.
- You see? They didn't sink us.
Let's get to shore.
I wouldn't dare pray for any more miracles, not in one day.
Turk, Duke, wait. I'm coming too.
Wait for me!
- Francis, stay in your tub.
- I'm coming!
(barking)
- Come back!
- Tie it round the tree stump.
(growling)
Come on, let's go.
Francis, come back here.
See you later.
First thing we'd better do is unload the raft. Then...
...put up some sort of shelter for the night.
Not the first thing.
Fritz. No, hold it, Fritz.
- We are not making any progress.
- I know.
It's got to hang down even on both sides.
- Aren't very good.
- We're lucky to have them.
- Pull your side down.
- Right, I've got my side.
Hold it down, Fritz.
Come on.
You're very lucky to have them.
(growls)
I think tomorrow, if the ship's still there, you and I, and maybe Ernst, ought to try and bring in the animals and anything else we might need.
- How long will we have to stay here?
- I don't know. I just...
I just think we ought to do everything we can.
(screams)
(click)
What's going on?
Powder was wet.
(thunder)
(screeching hooting)
Aren't you coming to bed?
You have to have some sleep.
- Besides, it's going to rain.
- No, I'm alright.
No-one can go back and undo what's already done but...
Well, I... want you to know that...
...l'm sorry things didn't work out the way I wanted them to.
I know.
It would have been better if we'd just stayed in Bern.
I'm not so sure. Not with Napoleon trying to grab up more and more.
Fritz and Ernst might both be in a war. Maybe even you.
No. Better to stay and face things rather than just running away.
Is it running away to try to find a new life in a new colony?
Try to give our sons a chance to live, a chance to be free?
Is that running away?
I keep thinking about all the men in those other offices along the Marktgasse. They go on working at the same old jobs and manage to find opportunities for their families, without running off to the other side of the world.
We settled all this before we left home.
It was a good thing we set out to do.
We were right. Nothing has changed just because we were shipwrecked.
You're always right, aren't you?
We'll get there. I'm sure of it.
Sooner or later there'll be a ship.
I'll pray for it with every breath I take.
It's a big land, New Guinea.
For hundreds of years there'll be new colonies, a great new world to build.
No limit to what a man can do.
If we're a couple of months late getting there, it won't matter.
We're not too badly off, are we?
We've got each other, the family,
- food to eat.
- Even a tent to keep the rain off, if we had sense enough to use it.
(thunder and rain)
Now don't worry.
Try to go back to sleep.
I'm soaked!
- Having trouble?
- I'll get it down, but it may take a while.
(pigs squeal)
Easy.
(bleating)
Wait a minute. Hold him.
Easy!
(bleating)
I keep trying to tell her it's for her own good.
A ship! There's a ship!
Ahoy! Ahoy there!
I think they've seen us.
Take a look, Fritz.
- There's something on the sail...
- I knew it.
It's the pirate ship that chased us into the storm. Get down!
And I deliberately tried to get their attention.
This time we have a weapon.
- Do you know how to fire it?
- I think so. Let's pull it back.
I'll get a keg of powder. See if you can find some rags, for wadding.
I know. I'll be right back.
(shouts in foreign language)
(whistling)
We'll only have one shot. Let's wait until we can't possibly miss.
(whistle and splash)
(canon fires)
- What's happening?
- They're going away.
Did they see us loading the cannon and get scared?
Pirates scared off by one cannon and three people?
Do you know what they're up to?
What's that?
A quarantine flag, warning there's Black Death aboard.
How did you know that?
Well, I do a bit of reading too.
Come on, Fritz.
(cow moos)
- Pull those new lines tight.
- Right.
Yes, that's it. There.
(bleating, crowing, gobbling)
(grunting)
No! What's the matter with you?
(moo)
Not that way, stupid. This way.
- Maybe it's too much for one trip.
- We had to try.
Sharks!
(anxious lowing)
- You got one!
- Watch that one coming in.
- There's another one.
- I'll get it.
- I hit it!
- Here comes another one!
Get out of here!
Got one.
Look out, Ernst, there's another.
- No, it's a turtle.
- We disturbed him with our shots.
I think we scared them away.
It's pulling us!
Better to use your head than break your back, I always say.
Francis, see if you can find the...
Where are you?
Here, Duke, Turk. Here, boys.
(barking)
Where's Francis? Go find him.
Now you wait just one minute and I'll have some sugarcane for you.
Now, come along, little fella.
I won't hurt you.
Now, just let me fix this.
Here, little elephant. Come here.
That's right.
Come on, little elephant.
I wouldn't hurt you.
Come on, little fella.
I wouldn't hurt you.
I have some nice fresh sugarcane for you.
Come on.
(trumpets)
Come on. Just a little closer.
That's right.
Come on, little fella.
(Mother) Francis, where are you?
Now you just put your foot... right there.
Come on, little elephant.
A little closer.
Just a little bit closer.
Right...
Now stop pulling!
(growls)
(trumpets)
What's the matter?
- (trumpeting)
- (Mother) Francis.
(growls)
You get out of here!
(trumpets)
Francis
Francis, where are you?
You get away from my elephant.
Get out. He's my elephant.
(barking)
(growling and roaring)
(barking)
Duke, Turk, come on!
You bit him enough.
Good old Duke.
Did I tell you you could leave the beach?
You might have been eaten, wandering off that way!
What do you have to say for yourself?
- I'm sorry but...
- But what?
Can I keep the baby elephant, anyhow?
Now I'll keep you.
Come on, Rocky, get going.
Alright, Francis, hold it.
Slack off a bit.
Come on, Rocky, back up.
Good little fella, back up.
- Right.
- Hold it.
- That was a good idea, Ernst.
- Thanks, Fritz.
Come on.
Fritz, no more full planks, just some odds and ends.
I think we've got enough.
Well? What do you think of it?
I'd like it a lot better if I knew tigers couldn't climb trees.
They won't climb this one.
You probably won't have seen such a house.
I'm sure of that.
The world is full of nice, ordinary little people who live in nice, ordinary little houses on the ground.
But didn't you ever dream of having a tree house?
No. Mostly I dream of having a house in New Guinea.
You think we're going to be here for a long time.
This I have no way of knowing but we can't sit on the beach just waiting for a ship.
- But there could be a ship?
- Of course.
Then I think we ought to try to light the signal fire.
And just forget about the pirates?
Maybe they won't come back.
Maybe we could get away with it.
We can't chance it. Being alive is more important than being found.
- Don't look down.
- Alright, Mother. I've got you.
- What do you think?
- Fritz, can I sleep with you?
- What an idea!
- It's not built for two.
- But I'll give you a swing.
- Be careful. Take this rope.
Tie it around his waist.
Mother?
(Frances squeals)
- Getting on, aren't we?
- Yes.
Here, I want to show you something.
(Frances) Faster.
(gasps)
Look. This is our room.
You won't to get me to go up there,
- not without some sort of railing.
- It'll be like a house, enclosed.
This is your own circular stairway.
Let's go back down before someone falls off the edge.
- Come on, Francis.
- He'll be alright. I'll go first.
(chattering)
Come on, little fella. I wouldn't hurt you. I just want to pet you.
Come on.
- Frances.
- (shouts)
- Hold him, Ernst.
- I've got him.
- He caught it.
- Are you alright?
Yes. He's my new pet.
Don't let him go.
- Feel his heart beating!
- Mine could match his beat for beat!
Supposing I hadn't insisted that he had this rope tied around his waist?
Until you get a railing put up,
I don't want Francis back up here.
And I assure you
I won't be up here either!
I'm sorry, dear.
I don't blame you for being upset.
But you don't seem to understand what we have in mind.
No, but won't you trust us?
Do what you like, just see Francis is on the ground.
I assure you I won't be back up here.
Alright, we'll do that.
You stay back in camp and when we've got everything as we want it, then we'll bring you back, see how you feel.
(chatters)
Don't you think you can talk to me like that.
- How much further?
- Hurry! You'll love the new house.
This way, Mother. Wait till you see what we've done.
There's all sorts of things inside.
You just wait.
- We must be there now.
- Take off the blindfold.
Just a moment, please.
Old Swiss custom.
Carry the bride across the threshold.
Father!
Duke, Turk, get out of my way.
(bell tolls)
How's this?
All the latest innovations.
Running water.
Genuine imported tortoiseshell.
And not forgetting the cooler.
This is Ernst's contribution.
He invented it.
He and Fritz built it.
See how it works, Mother? Look.
Big wheel turns the little wheel up there, the cup pours the water into the shell, it runs down the bamboo and feeds the sink and the cooler.
I... can't believe it.
Darling, thank you.
I'm second. I go after Mother.
- Thank you.
- Up you go.
(parrot squawks)
Up there's the boys' room.
And look.
This is something I worked out. When in for the night, turn the wheel, pull up the stairs.
Keeps out wild animals and neighbours who may become a nuisance, always wanting to borrow something.
We'll be troubled so much by them!
Get me down!
Whoah.
Remember this? I built it for us.
Don't tell me, you pull this to ring for the butler.
Here, I'll show you.
You can lie and look at the stars.
Don't you remember?
That summer we went to Interlaken.
You said that some day, if you could have your wish, you'd sleep each night so you could see the stars.
What is it? What's wrong?
These curtains don't belong here.
They're from the Captain's cabin. We thought you'd like them.
It's so wonderful. I don't deserve it. I can't believe it.
Don't worry about the curtains.
If you don't like them, I know a woman who can fix anything.
(Mother sings)
# ... was an island on a stormy sea
# Till my golden ship of dreams
came to me
(hums)
# ... filled with the wondrous dreams
# that love brings to light
# so when you're old...
Here it is. Tiger.
"Panthera tigris, a native of Asia, ranges north to Siberia and south to India and the Malay Peninsula."
Only with a land bridge could there be so many different animals on one island.
How do you know it's an island?
Why couldn't it be a peninsula?
Well, why don't you let us try and sail around it?
You know how your mother feels about that.
I think there used to be a land bridge between here and Asia.
This is all that's left.
That's why so many different types of animals are trapped here.
What do you think, Fritz?
Do you agree?
I suppose there could have been one, a long time ago.
There's only one way to find out.
Ask Mother again.
Maybe she'll change her mind.
Mother wants to get to New Guinea too. There might be a village or some place where ships come in.
If the occasion presents itself, I might bring it up again. What's this?
A spelling competition?
"Tiger, bear, elephant."
That's a list of animals we've identified so far.
"Hyena, monkey, lizard."
(squawking and barking)
Ostrich.
Help!
- Francis, let go!
- I can't let go
- or he'll get away.
- Let him go anyway. We'll catch him.
Frances.
- Are you alright?
- Yes, I'm alright.
Are you alright?
Not a mark on him that won't wash off!
- Grab his neck.
- We can learn to ride him.
Let me try. Help me out.
We'd better get him trained a bit first.
- Let me try it, then.
- Alright.
I get to try next.
I got it.
You silly...
(whoops)
Here I go.
Look out for that rock.
No, you gotta keep swinging.
Everybody, follow the leader.
Come on, I'll race you down.
Mother, look at me.
- Go on, Father. You can do it.
- Of course I can.
Whaa!
Here I come.
- Where are we going?
- Wait and see.
Come on.
(chattering)
Look at the monkeys. Look.
- What?
- Look at them swinging.
- Look at that.
- I can do that.
- Let's see you try.
- Anyone can change hands.
- Now, steady.
- Go on.
My turn next.
- No, my turn.
- After me.
Are you alright?
Never better. See what I mean?
- You really are very graceful.
- Thank you very much.
Isn't this the kind of life we were meant to live on this earth?
Everything we need. Everything's right here, right at our fingertips.
You know, if only people could have all this and be satisfied,
- the world wouldn't have problems.
- Or any future generations.
There isn't everything we need right at our fingertips.
- Now what are you talking about?
- This.
It's wonderful for today, but what about tomorrow? And our sons?
- What future is there here for them?
- Tomorrow can take care of itself.
Suppose we never got away?
They'd never know what it was like to be married.
Yes. Yes, that's right.
Now you come to mention it, there aren't many girls around here.
It's nothing to joke about.
Suppose they never have a chance to know what it's like to have a family?
What you're trying to say is we ought to make every effort to get away?
- Exactly.
- Right.
Then I'll tell the boys they can sail around the coast,
- see what they can find.
- That's not what I said!
Sooner or later we'll have to face it.
But what do they know about sailing and outrigging and...
- Do you think it's safe?
- We can't hold on to them forever.
Come on, Rocky, you can pull it faster.
Come on, pull.
Fritz, grab hold. That's it.
We'll be back soon and maybe we'll find a ship to take us away.
Don't worry, Mother.
Be careful, Fritz.
Get Rocky clear.
Back up.
Well...
It's going to be up to you,
Fritz. If you run into a storm or trouble of any kind, I'm relying on your judgement, your good sense.
Make sure you both get safely back.
Goodbye, Ernst.
- Goodbye. Don't worry.
- Remember to use your head.
(whoops)
(trumpets)
Good luck.
Don't worry.
They'll be back before you know it.
I hope we are doing the right thing.
Letting them go.
I'm sure we are.
If we'd let them go sooner we might be in New Guinea by this time.
- Bye! Bring me back a crocodile!
- Goodbye!
Goodbye.
I wish Mother could see this place. She'd love it.
You know what I'd like? I'd like to see some real mountains once again.
Walk the Oberland.
Stand looking up at the Jungfrau when a storm moves in.
Remember how you could smell the snow in the air?
Do you ever think about what you'd be doing if you'd stayed in Bern?
Sometimes.
I think about Herr Kobel, what he said, that I should attend the Academy.
- Fine chance you would have had.
- It might have worked out.
I tell you where
I'd really like to be.
Walking down the Nydeggasse, like on a Sunday after church.
All the girls stroll past all dressed up.
- Anyone in particular?
- No, nobody special.
Maybe you don't know them or speak to them, but you look and they look and you just know they're there.
Fritz, if we ever get to New Guinea, will there be any girls our age?
By the time we get to New Guinea we won't care what age they are!
Ernst, get the sail down. Quick!
- Keep down.
- What's the matter?
- What happened?
- Quick, give me the glass.
There's something moving over there on the beach.
Pirates.
I'm sure it's the same one we scared off with the quarantine flag.
Let's sneak in closer. If we stay behind the rocks they won't see us.
- Ernst, bring the bow round.
- I'm trying.
(shouting)
That chest they've opened was my
First Officer's, God rest his soul.
I wish they'd fight and kill each other.
You let me do any talking.
No! Leave him! Put him down!
Kuala, listen to me!
Little boy, you all alone.
He is 14 years.
Leave him alone.
Leave the boy alone! Kuala, wait!
You will want me to write a ransom note. I write.
My people send money if you let me go.
You send plenty money, then you go.
No, wait!
Leave the boy with me or I not write ransom note.
No boy, no note.
I'm sorry, Bertie, to have got you into this.
We'll... get out of this somehow.
Now keep as still as you can.
You'll only make things worse.
Now they'll decide which crew is going to take us.
We could sneak in and free the old man and the boy before the others knew what was happening.
Alright.
It's now or never. Come on.
At least I think they'll keep us together.
- Shhh. Don't make any noise.
- Who are you?
- Who are you?
- We've come to help you.
- If only we had a knife.
- Quick! Don't bother with me.
Get the boy free first. Go on!
They won't harm me. I'm valuable for ransom. Get Bertie free.
Get away if you can.
If they ransom me, I'll get a ship and come back for you.
I won't leave without you.
Get away quickly.
Don't waste time on me. Go on!
- Run!
- No, I won't go!
Go on, leave me!
(gunshots)
Ow!
- Come on.
- I can't go on another step.
(shouting)
In here.
Shhh!
Pirates took your ship?
What were you, cabin boy?
The old gentleman back there's your grandfather?
Come on.
And who are you anyway?
Where did you come from?
- We were shipwrecked. Our ship...
- (yell)
Ernst.
Run.
Come on.
They're leaving.
They're going away.
Could be a trick, so we come back, like the Greeks and the Trojan horse.
I think we'll stay here until daylight.
Probably save time cutting across the island instead of going around the beach.
No question about it now, this is an island.
What about me?
What am I going to do?
I guess you'll come with us.
Right about that direction should take us home.
But if they release my grandfather he'll come back here to look for me.
Don't worry. He knows you're with us.
If we're not here, he'll just sail around the island.
He couldn't get a ship past our place unseen, even if he wanted to.
- Bertie, you can have the middle.
- Come on.
I'll just sit up. Not sleepy.
(chattering)
Fritz.
Do you imagine we've changed a lot since we first landed?
- In what way?
- Lots. Like getting stronger,
- more sure of ourselves.
- I suppose so.
When we first came here, everything scared us.
- All those strange noises.
- How could I forget?
We must have been pretty helpless.
That I'd have to agree with.
Listen. You don't think we were something like him?
I don't think so.
Did you get a good look at his hands?
I bet he's never done anything.
A wealthy family, an only child.
- Sometime, look at the way he walks.
- I did!
And back home, we used to call
Jean Monteau a sissy.
Remember we were wishing we could see some girls?
We're so close to getting our wish but we've still missed it completely!
That direction. That's the way we've got to go, Fritz.
We'll cross here. Doesn't look as though it'll be over our heads.
Do we have to cross just here?
It's easy. Take off your clothes, carry them over your head.
Better than walking in wet clothes.
Just until we've crossed the deep part.
- I can't swim.
- I don't think you'll have to.
Come on, get started.
I'm going back to the beach to wait for my grandfather.
- Don't come any closer!
- Are you out of your mind?
- Stay back!
- That's my gun! You can't take it!
Sorry, but I need it more than you.
My grandfather will make it alright with you.
Wait. You keep his attention.
- I'll slip round behind him.
- I'll keep his attention!
You! Bertie!
Put that down or I'll let this go.
Drop it!
Don't do that, Ernst, I'll shoot!
I don't want to shoot you.
Now put that down!
(gun fires)
Let go of me!
Stop it!
I'll teach him to shoot at me!
She didn't mean to fire.
I don't care! I could have been...
What? She didn't?!
(whimpers)
It's a girl!
Why would a girl dress up like that?
It was because of the pirates.
My grandfather made me cut my hair and dress like this because...
Because he didn't want them to know.
At least now you can wash your face.
Well, it'll be nice to be called Roberta again.
I'm sorry, but if we'd known you were a girl
- we wouldn't have...
- We'll try to make it easy for you, as much as possible.
- Careful.
- Give me your hand.
Thank you.
Careful. Watch your step, Roberta.
Thank you, Fritz.
Variations and deviations are two completely different things.
Like here, Roberta.
Variations can be compensated for mathematically.
But deviations, you never know when they're going to happen.
My grandfather will get you navigating one of his ships.
- Would you like that?
- Maybe. Someday.
I'd like to finish school first, though.
- Do you like the sea, Fritz?
- I like things you can depend on.
You can never be sure of the sea.
That's the fun of it, not being sure.
"The winds aloud howl o'er the masts, and sing through every shroud.
Pale, trembling, tired, the sailors freeze with fears and instant death on every wave appears."
Homer's Iliad. One of the most beautiful things ever written.
When we were caught in the storm I thought of those lines over and over.
Do you read a lot, Fritz?
Him? He practically doesn't even read at all.
Never needed to. Ernst always tells me everything he knows.
I think we're getting off course.
We should bear more...
...to the right.
It's alright, he won't hurt you.
It's gone. Come on.
Stay close to me.
(bird calls)
(chattering and bird calls)
(gasps)
(yells)
Get out of it, quick!
Do something!
Get the knife!
Ernst, the knife! The knife!
Hurry.
Hurry, Ernst!
- Hit the head!
- I can't find it.
Here!
Now!
I'm sorry it took so long to find it.
It was horrible.
Let's go back.
Please, let's go back.
It keeps getting worse.
And worse.
I think the worst is behind us now.
Here, give me your hand.
No! My compass has gone!
I don't know where to look.
I guess we'll have to get along without it.
Without it? We wouldn't have a chance. We need that compass.
We don't necessarily need a compass.
I think I can do as well without it.
Think? You could be wrong.
Alright, I don't think it,
I know it. And from now on, Ernst, you're just going to have to trust my judgement. Come on.
How's it feel now, Roberta?
I don't care what he says.
I can't go on day after day.
- We've got no other choice.
- We're lost and you know it.
- We're not lost.
- If you want to go on, go ahead.
Ernst and I have decided not to.
You've what?
We can find the river and follow it back to the coast.
- Anyway, it's two against one.
- Even if it were ten against one
I've got to get us back and I'm going to.
Being older doesn't make you always right.
- What are you doing?
- Taking charge of the pistol.
It was appropriated once before when somebody wanted to go back.
Give me back my pistol!
Now, watch yourself.
Stop it!
Have your pistol back.
But you only have a few shots left.
How far do you think you'd get?
There isn't any decision to make.
We've got to keep going.
I suppose we'd better go with him.
- Do you think you can?
- I'll try.
(animal cries)
(zebra cries)
Hey! Hey!
Go on, get out! Get away!
Go on. Get away.
(hyenas snarl and wail)
Get away. Go on.
You really got yourself into a mess.
Alright, I won't hurt you.
Easy, boy. Easy. I'll get you out.
If we can get him out, maybe you won't have to walk all the way.
You'll never get him out that way.
I'll get more branches, to make a path.
At a time like this you gotta use your head. Here you are.
# O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree,
thy leaves are so unchanging
# O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree,
thy leaves are so unchanging
# Not only green when summer's here,
but also when 'tis cold and drear
- # O Christmas tree,
- (organ squawks)
# Thy leaves are so...
Must have got wet coming over.
I don't know how you managed to get it ashore.
I couldn't have done it alone.
Fritz and Ernst helped. I...
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.
Are we ever gonna open up these other packages?
- Those are for Fritz and Ernst.
- But suppose they don't come back?
- Suppose they got ate up?
- Francis, it's been a long day.
- And it's past your bedtime.
- But it's Christmas.
- Merry Christmas, sweetheart.
- I'll come up and say goodnight.
Alright.
(organ)
(discord)
(whining)
(distant singing)
# O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree,
much pleasure thou can'st give me
It's Fritz and Ernst!
What have you got there?
Did you bring me back my crocodile?
# O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree,
thy leaves are so unchanging
What have you got there? We thought you got ate up or something.
Merry Christmas!
Merry Christmas!
Merry Christmas!
- What is it?
- A zebra.
Merry Christmas!
Ernst! Happy Christmas!
- Mother!
- Fritz! Happy Christmas!
# O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree,
thy leaves are so unchanging
A zebra.
# O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree,
thy leaves are so unchanging
- I think I need that razor next.
- Let's see, Ernst.
Yes. Got it.
It's a good thing you boys have done. A very good thing.
And I'm going to try and make sure it's not wasted.
How do you mean?
The pirates know you took their prisoner and that you're on this island.
Think they're going to forget?
They didn't know she was a girl and not a cabin boy.
They wouldn't come after us.
What have we got?
- We've got their prisoner here.
- Pirates! If they come here,
I'll shoot them.
It'll take more than a crossbow.
We'll get the cannon from the ship.
It's useless.
It's rusted right over.
I should have covered it up.
Let's not waste time looking backwards.
Thank you, Father.
First thing tomorrow, we'll go out to the ship, take off everything else we might possibly need and then blow her up.
- You mean with gunpowder?
- What for?
They already know it's there.
I'm hoping that with hundreds of islands and thousands of reefs, they won't remember exactly where we are.
Father's right.
We have to blow it up.
Be ready to fight but not too proud to hide, eh?
Just a sip now.
That's enough.
It must have taken great courage to pack up and set off for a new colony and leave your whole world behind you.
With my husband and my sons, I wasn't leaving my entire world behind me.
You couldn't know what you were getting into. All the hardships.
Think of the things you might have had to do without.
Take a look.
- It's beautiful.
- I've always wanted a daughter, someone I could dress up and make clothes for.
I just didn't expect it for Christmas.
Thank you.
How about this? We get some trees, bend them down, make snares, the pirates step in the snares, trip them and they're caught.
But how can we defend this place?
I think what we need is a hill, so they have to come up to us.
- I got an idea.
- What is it, Francis?
We could dig some big pits and then we could put lions, tigers, snakes, and all sorts of animals in there.
When the pirates come, they fall in.
I don't know whether we could manage the lions and tigers, but I think a few pits might be a very good idea.
Nyah!
You look very beautiful, my dear.
Come and join the family.
Allow me, Roberta.
May I have the pleasure of the first dance?
Oh!
(country dance)
There. What did I tell you?
Anything we really need, the island will produce it. Even a girl.
A girl. But we have three sons.
Excuse me, Fritz.
I'll dance with you, Fritz.
I'll rest awhile, if you don't mind.
- What's the matter?
- I was just thinking.
We gotta have those lions and tigers or else...
Well, that's the whole idea.
I guess we'll just have to have them, then.
(monkey chatters)
Since you have a partner, Ernst,
I'm sure you won't mind.
(laughter)
It might have been simpler if I'd left the dress in the chest.
Alright, keep playing.
Thank you.
Come on, Francis.
May I have the pleasure?
(whooping)
Something must have gone wrong with the fuse.
We're not going back to find out.
We'll have to pick up every scrap of lumber. Can't leave any evidence.
Must be getting close.
(explosion)
Ka-boom!
I used to dream that somehow we'd find a way to make her sail again.
Now...
Well, we can be sure of one thing.
If the pirates do come, we're going to outnumbered.
Maybe ten to one.
But up here, if we prepare everything in advance, we'll be able to give a good account of ourselves.
We'll be like medieval knights defending the castle.
We'll keep the muskets for our final defence.
I'll give the order when to use them.
Of course, if anything should happen to me, then Fritz will take charge,
- then Ernst.
- And then me.
Yes, then you, Francis.
We've only got a small army.
We can only afford one general.
Now that's our weak point and this is where they'll try to come up.
We could have used the cannon.
We'll have to do the best we can without it.
Down there we'll put our pits and our snares and our entanglements.
We could plant some gunpowder and touch it off with fuses from the top.
Anything to hold them up.
You can rely on me, Roberta.
I've got it all worked out.
Can I take care of the lions and tigers and things?
- You're in charge of the tigers.
- Good.
I'd like to be something in the world, so I want to go to school.
You'd love it in London, anyway.
There are concerts, parties, dances.
Ladies in beautiful gowns.
Elegant men in tall hats.
- Did you ever own a tall hat?
- No.
I can't wait to see you in one.
You'll be quite handsome.
I think that's what I miss most of all, the colour and the excitement.
I know I'd especially like it... if you were there.
I'll be there. As long as I live,
I won't travel any further from home than an occasional trip to the seaside.
Thank you, Roberta.
There must be something my grandfather can do for you all.
Herr Kobel used to say,
"For some boys school is a punishment, for others a reward."
There must be something my grandfather can do.
(cow bells jangle)
Francis, don't! If you drop that you could blow us all to pieces.
Dropping it wouldn't set it off.
You'd have to light the fuse.
- Even then I'm not so sure.
- You don't think they'll work?
They'll make noise, keep the pirates confused, that's all.
Just because Papa thought of them instead of you.
What's all this?
More pirate alarms?
Yes, for the steep side.
You and your pirate alarm.
What about your tiger?
Have you caught him yet?
No. Until Fritz and Ernst dig the pits there's no place to keep him.
Ernst, Roberta.
- One of you, give me a hand!
- It's alright, I'll go.
Don't bother.
Up there.
Pull the knot as tight as you can.
Francis, put that down!
Is that alright?
Good.
There we are.
What are you doing?
He was just showing me how it will work.
I feel sorry for any pirates who come.
It was my idea. If you like I'll show you what else I had in mind.
(explosion)
Pirates. They're here! Into the fort, everybody! Come on, quick!
- What is it?
- Francis! Where is he?
You know those coconut bombs?
You don't have to worry about them.
They work right well.
Come down!
You might have been killed?
If you'd stayed put, Ernst, this wouldn't have happened.
- Don't tell me what to do!
- I just did.
- That's enough.
- I don't care.
He thinks he can just give orders.
I said that's enough.
This incident's closed.
Now let's get back to work.
I don't want to hear another word about it.
If you really don't want to go to school and your mind is made up, maybe my grandfather could give you a job. It'll be a good job, Fritz.
Perhaps in the counting house.
What if he doesn't get back here for some reason?
What if we have to stay on the island for 10 or 20 years?
He will come back, I know it.
He's probably headed this way now in one of his fastest ships.
You'd take the job if he offered it to you?
It's not that I wouldn't appreciate it, but it's just not for me.
Cooped up in an office counting somebody else's money, doing the same thing day after day.
What would you like to do?
If we get off this island I'd like to do what we started out to do.
Go on to New Guinea and become part of the new colony.
Maybe take up some land in my own name.
- Well, why?
- Why?
Well, because it's a good thing.
You've got a chance to build, with your own two hands.
It's the beginning of a new country.
That's what I like about it.
Well, I'm going to London.
Ernst was very flattering. He said he'd like to be there if I was.
Wouldn't you like to see me in London?
I don't know that I'll ever be in London.
I don't see how anybody can shoot a thing like this.
Why don't you teach me how to shoot?
It might be important if there's a battle.
Alright. Come on.
Well... first you pull the gun tight into your shoulder like this. And...
Well, here.
Tight into your shoulder and...
Well, right hand near the trigger.
No, here.
Left hand out to support it.
A little more. Right.
Now. No, you have to use this hand to support it.
Now you sight along the barrel here.
You don't mind?
Why do you think I wanted you to teach me?
- Roberta! Where are you?
- I'm over here.
May I have this next dance, m'lady?
You said that's what you missed.
- It's to make you feel at home.
- Where ever did you get that?
You wish the name of my tailor, sir?
Go past the town square, take the first street to the left.
- Weren't you covering the pits?
- Weren't you working on the bridge?
He was teaching me how to shoot.
I asked him to.
Fritz.
Come here a minute.
I want to show you something.
If you'd like to learn how to shoot,
Roberta, I'd be happy to teach you.
I think I have the general idea.
The old tiger, he'll come along here like this at night, after the pit's been all covered up, and he'll sniff the meat...
...and he'll start to circle the pit.
(yowls)
He'll come around here like this
...and he'll think, "I think I just might grab that big hunk of meat."
So he gets down like this, gets like this, and then...
Tell me, Francis, don't show me. Or you'll be in there before your tiger!
Anyhow, he'll jump for the bait and that's how I'll catch my tiger.
Think a tiger's going to fall for this? You're wasting your time.
You talk about wasting time.
How many hours did you spend making that silly hat?
None of your business.
You're not my boss.
No? We've got more important things to do than try to amuse Roberta.
You're jealous.
Jealous? Of what?
Why don't you grow up?
That's enough, Ernst.
Fight!
Now hit him, Fritz. Ow!
Come on, Fritz. Get him.
Fight!
Come on, Ernst. Fight.
Get him, Ernst. Come on.
Get him, Ernst.
What a beauty!
Now your turn.
Come on, Fritz, get him.
Fight. Are you afraid of him, Ernst?
Poke him one.
Come on, Fritz. Ernst!
- What's this all about?
- Nothing.
Who started it?
You know,
I think this is probably my fault.
I think I've been pushing everybody just a bit too hard.
It might do us a lot of good to relax for a change.
So here's what we're going to do.
Tomorrow, we are going to observe the first national holiday in the history of New Switzerland.
A holiday? You mean like Christmas?
Now let's get on with the work.
Get ready for it.
Yippee. A holiday. We're going to have a holiday, Roberta.
(roars)
- Where did we get all these flags?
- I got them off the ship.
- Allow me.
- Thank you.
(growls)
How do you like this?
For the winner of the race.
I'd better try it on for size.
Not going to argue?
Just conceding that I'll win?
This afternoon you and Ernst were fighting. It was my fault.
- It wasn't your fault.
- Everything that's happened lately is because you brought me back, even the danger we're in from pirates.
You didn't ask to be brought here.
In fact, you had quite different ideas. Remember?
Poor Ernst. The hours he must have spent making that silly hat.
He didn't mean to neglect his work.
He was just trying to be nice to me.
- I know that.
- I never dreamed he'd do that.
I did hope I could repay your family and all I've done is cause trouble between you. I didn't want to.
Don't.
Roberta, I'm not much at saying things, you know, but...
It's no good. When we leave here, you're going on and I'm going back to London.
Let's not make it difficult.
When we leave here? How do you know we're ever going to?
We might be here...
(roar)
- My tiger! I bet I got him!
- Francis, come back here.
Look out, Ernst.
(roaring)
- He might be anywhere.
- Let me go!
Francis, wait till we get there.
It's my tiger. Let me go.
Mind the pit.
Where is he?
I would never have believed it!
Well done, Francis.
Let's cover it with palm leaves so he'll go to sleep and the pirates won't know he's there.
Go and tell Mother. We'll do it.
Yes.
You don't have to worry any more!
I got my tiger!
He's got his tiger.
Everybody back behind the starting line.
Stay back.
Hang on.
Mother, you hold Duke, will you?
That's it.
You go round the first pylon and then over to that one, then back and forth three times and here to the finish.
And now, ladies and gentlemen, to the winner this gorgeous culinary creation which all of us will eat.
Quiet. Serving as official starter, the loveliest lady of the canton.
Quick! Come back!
Quick, Mother, fire.
Faster.
Come on, Rocky, get going.
Come on, Duchess. Run, girl.
That way. Come on, Rocky.
I can't get on! Give me a chance.
No, Turk, get out of here, you're ruining everything.
Look out, Mother.
Wait a minute, Ernst.
- No, not that way.
- Hold it, Clementine.
Jump on.
Good boy, Lightning.
You're going the wrong way, Roberta.
Come on, Rocky.
Stand still.
Now we're going to win.
It's not good if you can't stay on him, Fritz.
Turk, get away.
Not fair, Ernst, you have to ride him.
- Come on, Rocky, we're going to win.
- Come on, Lightning.
Straight on.
No, not that way, the other way.
No, the other way.
Come on.
Now.
I give up. Come on, Clementine.
Come on!
Out of my way.
I'm going to ride you if it's the last thing I do.
Quick, the tape.
That's not the way you're supposed to go!
Wrong way, Roberta.
Roberta. Come back here.
Come on, Rocky, we're winning!
Not fair, Roberta, I was winning!
You're not hurt?
- Pirates on the beach.
- What?
Pirates on our beach.
- Up the hill, everybody, quick!
- I'll get the muskets.
Come on, Roberta. Come on.
Remember your orders?
Get started!
Yes, sir!
(barking)
Come on. Come on, Francis.
(barking)
Duke, Turk, come back.
No time now. They'll be alright.
Come along, Mother.
Come on, Francis.
Just stay quiet.
Quick.
(barking)
Frances
(whistles)
They've seen us.
They've seen us. The bridge, quick.
Alright, Mother?
Here, Duke! Here, Turk!
Good boy.
- Ready, Ernst?
- Ready.
Now!
Fritz, Ernst, come up.
Come up.
(screams)
They must be getting near it now.
Over this way a bit.
(roaring)
My tiger! He got them.
(screams)
(screams)
Number three.
Now, don't light it till I tell you.
Now.
The flame is meant to reach the powder at the same time as the pirates.
See what I mean? Give me the torch.
Bull's-eye!
They're running!
- Now the coconut bombs.
- No, not yet.
- They're coming round this way.
- Don't fire yet.
Get back.
We've got them on the run.
- Right. The coconut bombs.
- Good!
Ka-boom!
That's it.
Keep throwing.
We haven't stopped them. Use the rifles. Try and pick off the leaders.
Where are you going, Father?
Hurray, hurray1
It worked.
Watch those logs fall down.
There's a man getting squashed.
(roars)
We're safe!
Kuala make talk.
You hear?
We hear you.
You take boy belong Kuala.
Give us boy, no more fight.
You hear?
You want the boy? Come and get him.
We're ready for you.
You can put away your white flag.
- Maybe it would be better to agree.
- Don't worry.
He wouldn't bargain if he thought he could beat us.
Send the boy down the hill.
Kuala take boy.
Nobody hurt.
You hear?
You make Kuala fight long time then you die!
And Kuala take boy all the same.
It's true. You can't possibly hold them off forever.
You don't look like a boy any more.
If you give yourself up now...
But what will happen to all of you if I don't?
Nothing's going to happen to anybody.
He must think we're mad.
Roberta, don't listen.
(cow bells)
My pirate alarm.
They're coming up that way.
Quick. Down!
Look out! Father, look out!
Ernst, look.
Stay back.
Get down!
- How many rounds have we got left?
- Five.
Five.
(canon fire)
They're very close.
(canon fire)
They're running away.
(canon fire)
It's a ship. A merchantman.
They're firing on the pirates.
One of my grandfather's ships.
I knew he'd come for us.
- Yippee. Here we are!
- We're here!
- Can I see your hat, please?
- Of course.
Thank you.
No more, thank you.
That was delicious.
Nothing to it, my boy. I've given money to that college for years.
It's time I asked for something.
Well, Roberta and I have talked about school but a... university!
I never dreamed!
I'm going to a university!
As for the rest of you,
I won't try to influence you but if you'd like to return to Europe,
I could give you an interesting fresh start.
But if you still want to go to New
Guinea I'll happily take you there.
I think that since we have to decide forever, that...
...my husband and I would just rather stay here.
That's what you want?
It's been a good life for us here.
As Roberta says, there are things you have to do without.
But they're unimportant if people aren't around feeling sorry for you.
You mean I don't have to go?
Fritz and Ernst will go with you.
We'll keep Francis for a few years.
- I'll be back.
- You won't be without neighbours.
You realise that? This is a new island. There'll be a new colony,
- a new governor.
- You might be made governor, Father.
More than likely I should say.
Hello.
It's funny how you can change your mind about what's important.
What it is you really want.
Take your parents.
All of this time they've been wanting to get to New Guinea and now they have their chance they find everything they want is here.
You mean they're not going?
- I can understand how they feel.
- I do, too.
Two people, if they have each other, what more could they want?
I guess just to be alone.
Fritz, it's time to go now. The
Captain wants to sail with the tide.
Just coming.
Surely you'll want to go and see him off?
Anyway, I'll have to explain to my grandfather.
- Bye, Ernst.
- Good luck next year.
Goodbye, Mother, Father,
Fritz, Roberta.
Bye, Ernst.
God be with you.
Wait for me! Duchess!
Clementine! Turk!
(barking)

A legend is sung
Of when England was young
And knights were brave and bold
The good king had died
And no one could decide
Who was rightful heir to the throne
It seemed that the land
Would be torn by war
Or saved by a miracle alone
And that miracle appeared
In London town
The sword
In the stone
And below the hilt in letters of gold... were written these words:
"Whoso pulleth out this sword of this stone and anvil... is rightwise king born of England."
Though many tried for the sword with all their strength... none could move the sword nor stir it.
So the miracle had not worked.
And England was still without a king.
And in time, the marvellous sword was forgotten.
This was a dark age... without law and without order.
Men lived in fear of one another... for the strong preyed upon the weak.
A dark age indeed!
Age of inconvenience.
No plumbing... no electricity... no nothing!
Oh, hang it all!
Hang it all!
Oh, now what?
Now what?
Leave, leave off!
Leave off!
Oh, you, you, you fiendish chain you!
Everything complicated.
One big medieval mess.
Now, uh, let me see.
He should be here in,
I'd say half an hour.
Who? Who? I'd like to know who.
I told you, Archimedes.
I am not sure.
All I know is that someone will be coming. Someone very important.
Oh, pig feathers!
Fate will direct him to me so that I, in turn... may guide him to his rightful place in the world.
Huh! And-And you say he will arrive in half an hour?
Ha! Well, we'll just see.
And you will, Archimedes.
You will.
Ow!
He'll be, uh, a boy.
Small boy.
Eleven, 12 years old.
And a scrawny little fellow.
Oh, no, no.
That can't be the one.
Surely not. Why, that big lad must be close onto 20.
Ah. There he is.
The scrawny little fellow about 12.
He's a regular little grasshopper.
Look at him go.
And where-- where would you guess he is at this very moment?
I am not guessing,
Archimedes!
I know where he is!
Less than a mile from here just beyond the forest.
And right on schedule, if-if all goes well.
- Quiet, Wart.
- I'm tryin' to be.
And nobody asked you to come along in the first place.
- I'm not even movin'.
- Shut up.
Aha! Here we go.
Oh, what a set-up.
Right smack through the old gizzard.
Whoa. What? Oh!
Why, you clumsy, little fool!
Oh, Kay, please, I'm sorry.
I couldn't help it. Please.
If I ever--
If I ever get my hands on, on you, I'll, I'll ring... your scrawny little neck, so help me, I will.
I'll get the arrow, Kay.
I'm sure I can find it.
Don't tell me you're going in there.
Why, it's swarming with wolves.
I'm not afraid.
Well, go ahead.
It's your skin, not mine.
Go on, go on.
There it is.
Oh, there it is.
Whoa! What-- Oh!
Well.
So, you, you did drop in for tea after all.
Oh, you are a bit late, you know.
- Oh, l, I am?
- Yes.
Now, my name is Merlin.
Come, come, who are you, my lad?
Oh, my name's Arthur, but everyone calls me Wart.
Oh.
Oh, what a perfect stuffed owl.
Stuff--
I, l, I beg your pardon!
He's alive and he talks.
And certainly a great deal better than you do.
Oh, come, Archimedes.
Come, come now.
I, I want you to meet the Wart.
Now, you must forgive him.
He's only a boy.
Boy? Boy?
Well, I see no boy.
- Oh, I'm sorry that l--
- That's all right.
He's much too sensitive.
Sensitive? Huh?
Who? What? What?
- Oh, well.
- How did you know that I was--
Oh, th-that you would be dropping in?
Well, I happen to be a wizard. A soothsayer.
A prognosticator. I have the power to see into the future.
Centuries into the future!
I, I've even been there, lad.
And I've seen all these things.
They're, they're only plans and small models, of course, you know.
Now, this for instance is a steam locomotive.
There she goes.
Pretty good, eh?
Now, that won't be invented for hundreds of years!
Oh. You mean you can see everything before it happens?
Yes, everything.
Uh-uh, uh-uh.
Everything, Merlin?
Uh-- No, no, not everything.
I, uh, I admit I didn't know whom to expect for tea.
But as you can see...
I've figured the exact place.
You're very clever, sir.
Yes. Well, never mind the, the, the sir.
Just, uh, plain Merlin will do.
Now, would, would you care for sugar?
Oh, yes I would, please.
All right. Sugar. Sugar?
No, no, manners, manners, manners!
Guests first, you know that!
All right.
Say when, lad.
When!
- Have you had any schooling?
- Oh, yes!
I'm training to be a squire. I'm learning the rules of combat and swordsmanship and... and jousting and horsemanship.
Oh, yes, yes, very good.
That's, that's--
No, no, no, l--
I mean a, a, a real education.
Mathematics. History.
Biology. Natural science.
English. Latin. French.
No. When! When!
Blast it all! When!
Impudent piece of crockery.
Boy, now, you can't--
You can't grow up without a decent education, you know.
Oh, I suppose not, sir--
Merlin.
So, I am going to be your tutor.
But I've got to get back to the castle.
They'll want me in the kitchen.
Oh, well.
Then very well.
We'll pack and be on our way.
You-- You watch now.
You'll like this.
Higitus figitus zumba ka zing.
I want your attention, everything.
We're packing to leave.
Come on. Let's go.
No, no, not you. Books are always first, you know.

Now, stop, stop, stop, stop!
See here, sugar bowl. You're getting rough.
That poor old tea set is cracked enough.
Now. Now, all right.
Let's start again.
Ah, let's start-- Eh--
Oh. Where was l, boy?
- Uh, hock-hockety pockety?
- Oh, yes, yes, that's right.
Hockety pockety wockety wack

Hey, easy there.

- Ha, ha!
- What a way to pack.
Well-- Well, now, just a minute, boy.
How else would you get all this stuff into one suitcase, I'd like to know?
- Oh, but I think it's wonderful!
- Oh.
Yes, it is rather.
Now, well... don't, don't you get any foolish ideas that magic will solve all your problems.
- Because it won't!
- But, sir, I don't have any problems.
Oh, bah, everybody's got problems.
The world is full of problems.
Oh, blast it all!
There, now. You see what I mean?
See, that's the trouble with the world today.
Everybody butting their heads against a brick wall. All muscle and no mentality.
Do you want to be all muscle and no brain?
- I don't have any muscle.
- You don't? Well, how do you move about?
Oh, I suppose l,
I do have a little.
Aha. There, you see. Well, that's enough. Now, develop your brain.
Knowledge, wisdom. There's the real power. Higher learning.
That's the thing.
So, first thing tomorrow morning, we'll start a full schedule.
Eight hours a day. We'll have six hours for schoolroom and two for study period.
But l-- I don't have the time.
I have page duties.
Uh, page duties? Ha!
Ah, well, we'll change all that.
There's got to be a shake-up.
Well, yes, sir.
I, I suppose so.
How do you ever expect to amount to anything without an education, I'd like to know?
Even in these bungling, backward, medieval times... you have got to know where you're going, don't you?
Ye-- Yes, sir.
Yes, of course. So, you must plan for the future, boy.
You've got to find a direction.
And you've--
Now, by the by, what direction is this castle of yours?
I think it's north.
The other way.
Oh, oh.
All right, then we better get a move on. Come on, come on, lad. Pick up the pace. Pick it up.
Pick it up.
Pick it up.
Yo-ho, the devil take it!
No, the devil take it.
Anyone's got better sense than to go barging off in that infernal forest alone.
You had no business letting him go.
Look, Dad, I'm not the Wart's keeper.
Well, blast it all, I am.
After all, l, I took him in, adopted the lad, you might say.
Being his foster father, well, I'm responsible.
Whoop.
Tiger! Talbot! Off with you.
Now, look here, Wart.
What's the big idea of gallivanting off in the woods... and worrying the living daylights out of everybody?
- I'm sorry, sir.
- Well, sorry's not enough.
That's four demerits.
Four hours extra kitchen duty.
Eh, report to the cook!
- But, sir, I'd like you to meet--
- Go on, hop it, boy, hop, hop, hop it!
Well, yes, you've got to keep a tight schedule to run a big place like this.
Need strict rules.
Especially for small boys.
And I most certainly agree.
Who are you and--
Oh. I mean, uh, you?
Uh, my name is Merlin.
Uh, this is Archimedes.
A highly educated owl.
Educated owl?
Say, that's a good one.
Say. Hey, I know.
You've got him under a spell,
Marvin. You're a magician.
The name is Merlin.
And I happen to be the world's most powerful wizard.
Come off it, man.
Gadzooks!
All right.
I shall demonstrate.
Higitus figitus migitus moe... wind and snow swirl and blow!
What the devil are you up to?
And that is what I call a "wizard blizzard."
Hey, Kay, would you look at this?
An indoor blizzard.
And in the month of July.
So what?
All right, Marvin. Turn her off.
I'm convinced.
Alakazam!
I, uh-- I hope you don't go in for any of that black magic.
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Never touch the stuff. No.
My magic is used mainly for educational purposes.
In fact, that is why
I am here.
I have come to educate the Wart.
Oh, no you don't.
I'm running this place. And if you think you're gonna fiddle with my schedule... you'd better pack up your bag of tricks and be gone.
Wha-- Well, by Jove.
Hey, he's gone.
Hm-mmm. Good riddance.
I'm gone, but then,
I'm not gone.
So, if I do leave... you could never be sure that I am gone, can you?
Well, uh--
Well, I must say, you-- you got me there, Marvin.
Yes. Well, you win. You're welcome to stay if you like.
Thank you.
You're very kind.
Very generous, I must say.
Well, uh, all we can offer is room and board.
Hard times, you know, Marvin.
We'll put you up in the northwest tower.
That's the guest room.
It's a bit drafty in the winter... but in this blazing hot weather, it's the best room in the house.
Oh, yes.
Very lovely indeed.
So just make yourself at home, Marvin.
Marvin, Marvin,
Marvin, Marvin.
Best room in the house!
Guest room!
Unwelcome-guest room!
But if he thinks that he can get rid of me, I've got news for that old walrus.
- I'm sticking it out.
- And I say we go back to the woods.
No, not on your life.
That boy's got to have an education.
He has a future.
Well, you may be right.
A skinny kid like that would make a cracking good chimney sweep.
Something tells me that you're all wet, Archimedes.
- Who goes there?
- Pelinore!
It's Pelinore, dash it all!
I've got big news from London.
Big news!
Come on, man.
Drop the bridge.
Oh, big news, eh?
They can't wait for the London Times. First edition won't be out for at least, uh...
1200 years.
Archimedes, would you mind sailing down there and, and--
Not interested!
Oh, come, come, come, come now.
You're as wet as you can get.
No! No, no, no!
Archimedes! I'll turn you into a human.
- Hmph! You wouldn't dare!
- I will. So help me, I will.
Well, all right, all right.
All right!
All right.
It works every time.
Just like magic.
Pelinore!
Pelinore.
Greetings, old boy. And what's all the noise about London, hmm?
Big news. Really big news.
Sit down, man, and let's hear all about it.
They're having a big tournament
New Year's Day.
Oh, that's not news, dash it all. They always do.
Yeah, but, Ector-- Ector, here's where all the excitement comes in.
To the winner of this tournament goes the crown.
You mean-- You mean he'll be King of all England?
King of all England.
- Kay, lad, did you hear that?
- Pretty fair prize, I'd say.
Yes, and you can win it, boy, if you knuckle down to your training.
And we'll have you knighted by Christmas and off to London. What do you say?
Sure. Why not? Why not?
Wart, lad, how'd you like to go to London?
- Oh, Sir Ector, you mean it?
- If you stick to your duties, you can be Kay's squire.
Oh, I will, sir.
I will.
I don't want the Wart for my squire.
Here's to London!
And to here's to Kay.
And here's to the banner of the Castle of the Forest Suavage.
- Cheers!
- Cheers, cheers. - Cheers.
Charge!
Weight forward!
Lean into him!
Steady, boy. Steady!
Steady with the lance!
Grip her tight!
Hit him clean!
No, no, no!
Heads up!
Ar-Ar-Archimedes. Archimedes, wh-where, where, where are we?
In a tumble-down old tower... in the most miserable old castle in all Christendom, that's where.
C-Castle? Castle?
Don't you even remember the boy?
Uh, the boy?
Can't you remember one blasted thing?
- Oh, now, just a moment. I--
- Tight grip on the lance.
- Oh.
- Loosen the saddle, knees in tight.
Weight forward and stay on target.
You keep losing your grip.
It's not a mere matter of muscle, sir.
Jousting is, uh, uh, a fine skill.
It-- It's a highly developed science.
Science, indeed.
One dummy trying to knock off another dummy with a bit of a stick.
And the Wart's just as hot for it as the rest of them.
He certainly is. That boy's got real spark. Lots of spirit.
Throws himself heart and soul into everything he does.
That's really worth something if it can only be turned in the right direction.
Ha-ha.
Fat chance of that.
Oh, I plan to cheat, of course.
Use magic. Every last trick in the trade if I have to.
I'd give anything to go riding about on a great white charger... slaying dragons and griffins and man-eating giants.
Well, won't you?
Oh. No. You see.
I'm an orphan, and a knight must be of proper birth.
I only hope I'm worthy to be Kay's squire.
That's a big job too, you know.
Oh, indeed, yes, yes.
I would say almost impossible. Yes.
Well, now then. When I said that I could swim like a fish...
I really meant as a fish.
You mean you can turn yourself into a fish?
After all, I happen to be a wizard.
- Could you turn me into a fish?
- Well, do you have any imagination?
Can you imagine yourself as a fish?
Oh, that's easy.
I've done that lots of times.
Oh. Well, good. Then I think that my magic can do the rest.
Archimedes, what, what is that fish formula?
- Who? Who? What? What? What?
- You know, that, that, that Latin business.
Hmm? Fish? Latin?
Oh, uh.
Aquarius aquaticus aqualitus.
And-And now if you don't mind...
I say good day to the both of you if you please.
When he stays out all night... he's always grumpy the next morning.
- Then he must stay out every night.
- Yes.
Oh. Oh, yes. Oh, I say, that's very good, boy. Very.
Who? What? What?
All right, boy. All set.
Here we go.
Aquarius aquaticus aqualitus quum.
Aqua digi tarium.
Merlin, am I a fish?
Am I a fish?
Yes. Yes, yes, yes, yes, you are a fish... but if you don't stop that flippity-flopping around... and get in the water, you won't last long.
Now, now, stay right here in the tules and I'll-- I'll be with you in a minute.
Oh.
So you thought you could take right off like a shot, did you?
Well, I am a fish, aren't l?
You merely look like a fish.
That doesn't mean that you can swim like one. You, you don't have the instinct.
So, you'll have to use your, your brain for a change.
You are living between two planes now.
Somewhere between the ceiling and the floor.
Now, there, there's lots of ups and downs...
Like-like, uh, like a helicopter.
- Helicopter?
- Yes--
Oh. No, never mind.
Every flick of a fin creates movement.
So, first we'll start with a caudal fin.
No, no, boy.
Your tail. Tail.
Now, now, that gives you the forward thrust now.
Come on, let's get a rhythm.
Right, left.
Right, left. One, two.
Left and right
Like day and night
That's what makes the world go 'round
In and out
Thin and stout
That's what makes the world go 'round
For every up there is a down
- For every square
- There is a round?
Yes.
For every high
- There is a low?
- Uh-huh.
- And for every to
-- - There is a-- - Fro. - Fro.
Yes, fro.
To and fro, Stop and go
That's what makes the world go 'round
In and out
Thin and stout
- Merlin! Merlin!
- Oh!
- I swallowed a bug!
- Oh. What's wrong with that?
After all, ah, boy, you are a fish. I-instinct, you know.
- But you said I had no instinct.
- Yes, of--
Oh. Oh, I did. Well, th-that's neither here nor there.
But the main thing is you must--
Set your sights upon the heights
Don't be a mediocrity
- Mediocrity?
- That's right.
Don't just wait and trust to fate
And say that's how it's meant to be
It's up to you how far you go
If you don't try you'll never know
And so, my lad as I've explained
Nothing ventured nothing gained
Let's, let's swim through that tall grass again. It tickles.
Oh. Oh,
I beg your pardon.
Me too.
For every to there is a fro
For every stop there is a go
And that's what makes the world go 'round
Oh, let go, let go, let go!
Oh, you big, bug-eyed bully, you!
Who, me?
Oh, here, here, here, here, here, now, boy.
There's no sense in going around insulting bullfrogs.
A fish has plenty of other problems without that.
The water world has its forests and its jungles too.
So it has its tigers and its wolves. And that, eh, ah--
That's what makes the world go 'round
You see, my boy it's nature's way
Upon the weak the strong ones prey
The human life it's also true
The strong will try to conquer you
And that is what you must expect
Unless you use your intellect
Brains and brawn
Weak and strong
- Help, Merlin! Help! Help!
- That's what makes the wor--
Jehoshaphat!
Oh!
- Quick, Merlin, the magic!
- No, no.
You're on your own, lad.
Now's your chance to prove my point.
Wha-What point?
He's the brawn and you're the brain.
Oh, now, don't, don't, don't panic!
You use your head.
Outsmart the big brute.
Smart move, lad!
That's using the old intellect.
- Bravo, boy! Great strategy!
- Is the lesson about over?
D-D-Did you get the point?
Yes, yes, brain over brawn.
Okay, lad, I'll fix the big brute. Higgeldy piggeldy--
No, no. Hocus pocus--
Now, what in blaze-- Eh--
Merlin!
Now what? Oh, it's, it's that, that boy!
- Wh-Wh-What in b-blazes!
- Help! Help! Help!
Ouch!
Help!
Archimedes!
Help!
What in thunder is a monster like that doing in the moat?
By George, l-l-l-- I'll, I'll--
I'll turn him into a minnow.
- Merlin!
- Oh! Oh, there you are, boy.
Snick snack snorum!
How in the world did you ever get out of that mess?
That, that big fish almost swallowed me and, and Archimedes, he, he saved me.
Well, by George.
Oh, what do you know about that?
I did nothing of the sort!
I intended to eat him.
Young perch is my favourite dish.
You know that!
Oh.
- Do you believe that, Wart?
- Well, l--
Wart. Wart!
I've gotta go. Thank you,
Merlin. It was so much fun.
- And, Archimedes, l, l--
- Pinfeathers, boy!
Wart! Where are you, Wart?
Coming!
I'm coming.
Now, Archimedes.
Why would you half-drown yourself for a tidbit of fish?
And after such a big breakfast?
Pinfeathers and gully fluff!
We were doing fine until we got in deep water.
Then along comes this huge pike with big jaws and sharp, jagged teeth.
Oh, turn him off, Dad.
He was a monster!
The biggest fish I ever saw.
- And, boy, that's the biggest fish story I ever heard.
- But it's true, sir.
That's three demerits for being late and three more for the fish story.
Now, hop into the kitchen!
I told you the Wart was loony.
Yes, well, he's either out of his head or, uh.... there's something mighty fishy going on around here.
For every high there is a low
For every to there is a fro
To and fro
Stop and go
That's what makes the world go round
- Oh, it's you, Merlin, sir.
- Uh, yes, my lad.
Now, have you ever considered being a squirrel?
Well, no, I don't suppose.
Well, now, there is a tiny creature... with enormous problems.
How he has survived throughout the ages... is one of nature's big mysteries.
His life is hazardous.
Downright dangerous.
Uh, would you like to try it?
- Oh, no, I'd better not.
- Oh-ho.
It's, uh, too dangerous for you, eh?
Oh, no, it's not that.
It's just that I've got six demerits. All this work to do.
What a mess!
What a medieval muddle.
We'll have to modernize it.
Start an assembly-line system.
All right now. One and a-two and a-three and a-four!
Higitus figitus migitus mum
Skitun de bitun de batun de dum
- But I'm supposed to do it.
- No one will know the difference, son.
Who cares as long as the work gets done?
Rubbedy scrubbedy
Sweepety flow
Come on, son.
Let's go, let's go.
Wart. Wart!
Wart. Now, take it easy.
Take it easy, boy.
What? Oh, no, boy!
No, no!
- Wart!
- Whoa. Oh!
Now, what did I tell you?
Always look before you leap.
Well, I made it, didn't I?
Yes, yes, you made it. You made it, but you, you can't always trust to luck, boy.
Now, first thing... you start with the short jumps.
Gauge the distance carefully.
And-- Oh!
Now, there, you see?
Even, even, even then you can miss.
So, don't take gravity too lightly or it'll catch up with you.
- What's gravity?
- Gravity is what causes you to fall.
Oh, like a stumble or, or a trip?
Yes, it's like a stumble or a
-- No, no, no, no, no. It's the force that pulls you downward.
The, the phenomenon that any two material particles or bodies... if free to move, will be accelerated toward each other.
- Merlin, how will we get by?
- Hmm?
Oh. Oh, well, l, I suppose we better go back to a side track.
Go on, go on.
You got lots of room.
Well, l-- I, l, I guess she can't be sidetracked.
That's a girl squirrel, that, and a redhead at that.
- She sure acts funny.
- Well, she likes you.
Why?
Yes, well, well, well, that's nature again.
But I'm afraid there's no time to explain.
Here, here, now.
You better leave me out of it.
Yeah, me too.
Merlin! Merlin!
You're on your own, lad. I'm afraid magic can't solve this problem.
Look, I'm, I'm not a boy.
I mean--
I'm not a squirrel.
I'm a boy.
A human boy.
Not a real sq--
Oh, leave me alone!
Merlin, what'll I do?
She won't leave me--
Well, I'm, I'm afraid you're stuck, lad.
Well, when a girl squirrel chooses a mate, it's for life.
- But I won't be a squirrel tomorrow.
- But she doesn't know that.
She only knows one simple fact.
That you're a him and she's a her.
- That's a natural phenomenon.
- Phenomenon-menum?
Well, it's the, the, uh--
It's a state of being
A frame of mind
It's a most befuddling thing
And to every being of every kind it is discombooberating
You're wasting time resisting
You'll find the more you do
The more she'll keep insisting
Her him has got to be you
Now leave me alone!
I mean it!
It's a rough game
Anyone knows
Go away!
There are no rules
Anything goes
There's no logical explanation
For this discombooberation
It's a most bemuddling
Most befuddling thing
Oh! Who? Who? What-- What--
Now, go on. Shoo!
Get a tree of your own.
Skedaddle!
You-- You-- You-- You--
Oh, you squirrelly squirrels!
She's gaining on you, Wart.
There's no sensible explanation
For this discombooberation
It's a most hodge-podgical
Most illogical
Most confusiling
Most bamboozling
Most bemuddling
Most be-befu-fuddling
Thing
Really, now, Miss, uh--
Madam. I, uh--
You, you, you've made a mistake.
Now, now, now, please.
Please, you--
Oh! Madam! Madam!
Now, look here.
I am not a boy.
I, I mean, I'm--
I'm not a squirrel. I'm a b--
No, that's not what-- No!
No. I'm, I'm,
I'm a stupid old--
No!
I'm an old man.
An old human.
Understand?
Oh, hang it all.
Now, go away.
Shoo, shoo.
Impossible. Impossible!
Ooh, confound it!
Confound it all!
Merlin, I'm tired of being a squirrel.
It's nothing but trouble.
Oh, you've got trouble?
Look at my-- Look back there!
One side, lad.
Whoa, what--
Help, Merlin!
Help!
Oh, no!
By George!
I've had enough of this nonsense!
Alakazam!
There. You see? I'm an ugly, horrible, grouchy old man!
- Merlin!
- Oh.
- So, here we are.
- Quick, Merlin, the magic.
Snick snack snorum.
There. Now you see?
I'm not a squirrel. I'm a boy.
I tried to tell you.
I'm a boy.
A human boy.
Oh, if you could only understand.
Ah, you know, lad... that love business is a powerful thing.
Greater than gravity?
Well, yes, boy, in its way, I'd, uh--
Yes, I'd say it's the greatest force on Earth.
Oh, Ector!
Ector! Sir Ector! The kitchen!
- Hold it, son! Hold it.
- Black magic all over the place!
Kay! Hold on, I say!
Stop!
Oh. Now, what's all the commotion, hmm?
Oh, the kitchen, it's under an evil spell!
- Huh?
- It's bewitched.
Oh, I bet it's that old goat Marvin.
Come on, son.
I-l knew he'd give us trouble.
Gadzooks!
Black magic of the worst kind!
Come on, Kay!
To the attack!
Wha-- Oh!
Hold it!
Heaven preserve us!
Kay!
- Now, what have we here?
- Jumpin' hoptoads!
Alakazam!
So there you are, you old goat.
Well, what's the idea of flinging your evil spells all over the place?
Oh, oh, lend me a hand, boy.
Well, what have you got to say for yourself, hmm?
You call washing dishes and sweeping floors a work of evil?
I'll decide what's right and wrong around here.
Besides, that's the Wart's job.
One of his duties.
Uh, and look here, boy.
If you want to make that trip to London, you'd better tow the mark.
You old goat! lf I ever catch you in my kitchen again, I'll--
Madam, you won't.
Oh, dear. He's gone.
Well, by Jove.
We ought to run the old geezer right out of the castle.
Oh, no, no, no, no, Kay. No.
He might cast an evil spell on the lot of us.
Turn us all to stone.
No. There's no telling what the old devil might do.
He's not an old devil!
He-- He's good!
And, and his magic is good too.
If, if you'd just leave him alone!
Now, look here, Wart.
That's three more demerits.
- Box his ears, Dad.
- Just because you can't understand something...
- it, it doesn't mean it's wrong.
- Ten more demerits!
You make all the rules and, and nobody else can say anything.
You said a plenty, boy! All that popping off just cooked your goose.
Kay, from now on, young Hobbs is your squire.
Did you hear that, Wart?
Hobbs is going to be Kay's squire.
- Ye
-- Ye-- Yes, sir. - Now that'll teach you to pop off, you little pipsqueak.
Oh, I'm sorry, lad.
I'm sorry.
I spoiled everything.
I know that trip to London means a great deal to you.
Oh, it's, it's not your fault.
I shouldn't have popped off.
Now I'm really done for.
No, no, you're in a great spot, boy.
You can't go down now.
It can only be up from here.
- I'd like to know how.
- Use your head.
An education, lad.
What good will that do?
Get it first. Then who knows?
Are you willing to try?
Well, what have
I got to lose?
That's the spirit!
We'll start tomorrow!
We'll show 'em.
Won't we, boy?
We sure will.
Now, first of all, lad... we've got to get all these medieval ideas out of your head.
Clear the way for new ideas.
Knowledge of man's fabulous discoveries... in the centuries ahead.
- Now that'll be a great advantage, boy.
- Advantage, indeed!
If the boy goes about saying the world is round, they'll take him for a lunatic.
- The world is round?
- Yes, yes, that's right.
And it also goes around.
- You mean it'll be round someday?
- No, no, no.
It's round now. Man will discover this in centuries to come.
And he will also find that the world is merely... a tiny speck in the universe.
- Universe?
- Oh, you're only confusing the boy.
Before you're through, he'll be so mixed up, he'll, he'll be wearing his shoes on his head.
Man has always learned from the past. After all, you can't learn history in reverse.
It's, it's, it's confusing enough, for heaven sakes.
All right! All right.
Have it your way, Archimedes.
You're in charge.
You're the headmaster now.
So from now on, he's your pupil.
So, from now on, boy... you do as I say.
- Yes, sir.
- All right.
Now to start off, I want you to read these books.
- All of them?
- That, my boy, is a mountain of knowledge.
- But l, but I can't read.
- What, what? What? Then I don't suppose you know how to write?
- No, sir.
- What do you know?
- Well, l--
- Well, never mind. Never mind.
We'll start at the bottom.
The ABC's.
First the A, and now the B.
Loop and around and there's the C.
Merlin. Look.
I can write.
Oh. Yes, yes.
That's very good, boy. Very--
Henscratch, that's all.
Henscratch. Now, come on.
D, E, F, and now the G.
You see, it's as simple as--
No, no, no! No, boy!
Now, use your head. Use your head, will you?
How do you ever expect to learn anything?
Archimedes!
Have you seen that, uh... flying machine model?
I have nothing to do with your futuristic fiddle-faddle, you know that.
- What's that thing up there?
- Hmm? Oh, yes, of course.
- Here we are.
- You mean man will fly in one of those someday?
If man were meant to fly, he'd have been born with wings.
I am about to prove otherwise, Archimedes... if you care to watch.
Here she goes.
No, no, no, no, no--
Man'll fly all right.
Just like a rock.
It would have worked if, if, if, if it weren't for... this infernal beard!
I never, never in my whole--
Man will fly someday,
I tell you.
I have been there.
I have seen it.
Oh, I do hope so.
I've always dreamed about flying-- that I was a bird and that I could go sailing all over the sky high above everything.
Prestadigitonium.
It's my favourite dream.
Oh, but then I suppose everybody dreams about flying.
I'm a bird! I'm a bird!
I'm a bird!
Hold it, boy.
Not so fast. Not so fast.
First, l-- I'd better explain the mechanics of a bird's wing.
Now, these large feathers... are called the primaries.
- And, uh--
- And, uh, since when... do you know all about bird's wings?
I have made an extensive study of birds in flight. And l--
And if you don't mind,
I happen to be a bird.
All right, Mr Know-lt-All, he's your pupil.
- Ouch!
- Now, boy... flying is not merely some crude mechanical process.
It is a delicate art.
Purely aesthetic.
Poetry of motion.
And the best way to learn it is to do it.
Now, since we're pretty far up, we'll start with a glide.
Spread your wings way out, way out. That's it. That's it.
Now, fan your tail.
Tippity-toe, tippity-toe, and off we go.
Now, tuck your feet under, like me. That's it. That's the idea!
- Whoa! What? Oh!
- And don't fight the air currents.
Use them.
Well, say, boy!
That's pretty good.
Well, boy, you're a natural!
Are you sure this is the first time that you've--
Wart! Wart!
Hawk! Hawk!
Look out, boy!
Heads up! Wart!
Archimedes! Help!
Wart! Wart!
Whoa! What? Oh!
Sounds like someone's sick.
How lov--
Oh, bat gizzards.
It's nothing but... a scrawny little sparrow with a beak full of soot.
Oh, I-I'm not really a sparrow.
I'm a boy.
- A boy?
- Merlin changed me with his magic.
He's the world's most powerful wizard.
Merlin. Ho-ho!
Merlin, the world's most powerful bungler.
Why, boy, I've got more magic in one little finger.
Now, don't tell me you've never heard of the marvellous Madam Mim?
Well, no, I don't guess so.
Madam Mim? Oh! Good heavens, good heavens, good heavens!
My boy, I'm the greatest.
I'm truly marvellous!
With only a touch
I have the power
Zim zab rim bim
To whither a flower
I find delight in the gruesome and grim
- Oh, that's terrible.
- Thank you, my boy.
But that's nothing, nothing for me.
No! 'Cause I'm the magnificent... marvellous, mad Madam Mim.
You know what?
I can even change size.
I can be huge!
Ooh! Fill the whole house.
I can be teeny
Small as a mouse
Black sorcery is my dish of tea
Uh, it comes easy to me.
'Cause I'm the magnificent... marvellous, mad Madam Mim.
Marvellous, boy!
Marvellous, I'm marvellous!
Say, lad, did you know that
I can make myself uglier yet?
Well, that would be some trick.
Er, um, ah, I mean, uh--
Want to bet? Boo!
You see? I win, I win!
Aren't I hideous, boy?
Perfectly revolting?
- Well, uh, yes, ma'am.
- But you ain't seen nothin' yet.
Watch this.
I can be beautiful lovely and fair
Silvery voice long purple hair
But it's only skin deep for zim zaberim zim
I'm an ugly, old creep!
The magnificent, marvellous... mad, mad, mad, mad Madam Mim.
Now what do you think, boy?
Who's the greatest?
Well, uh, Merlin's magic is always, um, well, useful... uh, for something good.
- And he must see something good in you.
- Oh, I suppose so.
Yes, and in my book, that's bad!
So, my boy, I'm afraid
I'll have to destroy you.
De-Destroy me?
Yeah, I-I'll give you a sporting chance.
I'm mad about games, you know.
Yeah, well come on, get going, boy.
You gotta keep on your toes in this game.
I win, I win!
Oh, the game's over.
Why, you little devil, you! I'll wring your scrawny little neck!
Mim! Mim! Wha-Wha-What--
Eh, what was you up to?
Uh! Me-Me-- Oh, Merlin!
Well, you're just in time.
- We were playing a little game.
- She was gonna destroy me.
And just what are you gonna do about it?
Want to fight?
Want to have a wizard's duel?
- As you wish, madam.
- Well, come on, step outside.
After you, madam.
They're havin' a wizard's duel.
What's that mean?
Oh, it's a battle of wits.
The players change themselves... to different things and, and attempt to, uh, to destroy one another.
De-Des-De-Destroy?
But just watch, boy, just watch.
You'll get the idea.
Now, first of all, if you don't mind, I'll make the rules.
Rules indeed!
Why, she only wants rules so she can break 'em!
I'll take care of you later, featherbrain.
Now, rule one, no mineral or vegetable.
Only animal. Rule two, no make-believe things...
Like, uh, oh, pink dragons and stuff.
Now, rule three, no disappearing.
- Rule four, no cheating.
- All right, all right.
Now, pace off ten.
One, two, three, four--
- Merlin! She disappeared!
- Huh? Ah-- Duh-- Bah-- Mim!
Now, you made the rules!
Ouch!
- Change to somethin' else, Merlin.
- Ah-- Buh-- Y-Yes... yes, yes, yes, give me time to think.
- Ah, higgety-piggety. Ah, duh
-- No, no, no, no, no. - Quick, Merlin, hurry!
Ah-- Duh-- Hoppity-hip-hip.
Ha-ha!
Got me tail, now!
Madam, just a minute.
Ah-- D-D--
This is not the-the-the-the--
- Come on! Something bigger!
- Something smaller!
Mi-Mi-Mim, Mi-Mim,
Mi-Mim Mi-Mi--
Ooh!
Merlin! No disappearing.
Whoo!
Ouch!
Mim? Mim?
Are-Are-Are you--
Now-- Gah-- What-What--
W-W-What's going on here?
You, you-- You big blimp!
Squash me, will ya?
Ah, ah, ah, ah, Merlin!
- Ouch! Ooh!
- Bravo!
Oh, just you wait!
Just you wait! You're gonna pay!
So you want to play rough, do ya?
All right, Merlin. I'll smash you good, you old crab!
Jehoshaphat!
Here I come, Mim, ready or not.
Merlin, you wouldn't dare!
Now, now, Mim, Mim!
No-No dragons, remember?
Did I say no purple dragons?
Did l?
I win, I win!
Oh, that horrible old witch!
I'll, I'll peck her eyes out!
Huh, no, no.
No, no, no.
- He's gone!
- Disappeared.
Madam, I have not disappeared.
I am very tiny.
I'm a germ. A rare disease.
I'm called "malagolintomontorosis"... and you caught me, Mim!
What?
First, you break out into spots.
Followed by hot and cold flashes.
Then violent sneezing.
Huh! Watch it, boy!
Oh! Er-- You-You-You-You sneaky old scoundrel!
Oh, it's not too serious, madam.
Ah, you should recover... in a few weeks and be as good, uh--
Ah, heh-heh-- I-l mean as bad as ever.
But, ah, I would suggest plenty of rest... and lots and lots of sunshine!
I hate sunshine!
I hate horrible, wholesome sunshine!
I hate it, I hate it!
I hate, hate, hate, hate--
You were really great, Merlin, but-but you could've been killed.
It was worth it, lad, if you learned something from it.
Knowledge and wisdom is the real power.
Right you are, Wart, so stick to your schooling, boy.
Oh-Oh, don't worry, I will, sir.
I will, oh, I really will.
We will sing all night and all day we will fight
For the blue oak tree on the field of white
For the blue oak tree on the fie-ie-ie-ie-ield
Of white
Here's to victory in London for my son, Kay!
Sir Kay. I've been knighted, don't forget.
No-o, of course, son, of course.
Ah, here's to Sir Kay.
And who knows?
The future king of all England!
- Watch it, will ya?
- Kay the king?
What a dreadful thought.
Sir Ector! Sir Ector!
Hobbs has come down with the mumps!
Face all-all-all puffed up like a toad!
Then Kay'll need another squire, hang it all.
- Hmm. Wart, you're it.
- I'm what, sir?
Kay's squire.
You're going to London, boy.
Oh, Sir Ector!
Whoa! What? Whoa!
Merlin! Archimedes! Merlin!
Merlin, look!
I'm a squire!
Hah!
Oh. Uh, very nice, boy.
Yes, indeed. A fine monkey suit for polishing boots.
It's-it's what all the squires wear.
And I thought you were going to amount to something!
I thought you had a few brains!
Great future. Hah!
A stooge for that big lunk, Kay.
Congratulations, boy!
What do y-- What do you want me to be? I'm nobody.
You-- You don't know a thing about what's goin' on today.
I-I-I-I'm lucky to be Kay's squire.
D-- Oh! D--
Of all the idiotic--
Y-Y-Y-- I--
Blow me to Bermuda!
Where-- Uh, where did he go?
- To Bermuda, I suppose.
- Where's that?
Oh, an island way off somewhere that hasn't been discovered yet.
Will he ever come back?
Who knows?
Who knows anything?
For the crown of all England... let the tournament begin.
Oh, Kay, now it's up to the swords.
Swords? Swords?
Ah-- Oh, no! Kay?
What? What?
I, eh--
I-l-l forgot your sword.
Forgot my sword?
I-- I-l left it back at the inn.
Why, you bungling little fool!
I'll-- Oof!
You better get it!
Or don't you dare come back!
Let me in! Let me in!
Somebody please!
Please let me in!
It's no use, boy.
They've all gone to the tournament.
Oh, what'll I do?
Kay's got to have a sword.
Look, boy! Look!
There in the churchyard.
A sword!
Oh, Archimedes, a sword!
You're gonna have a time pullin' it out.
Huh! Watch it, boy!
Better leave it alone!
But Kay's got to have a sword.
Now, come on, quick.
Let's get out of here!
Y-You're up next, son.
Uh, better get ready.
Kay, Kay, here's a sword.
This is not my sword!
Hold on, Kay!
Wait a minute.
"Whoso pulleth out this sword--"
Ooh, eh-- It's the sword in the stone!
- The sword in the stone? It can't be.
- But look. It is!
- It's the marvellous sword.
- Hold everything.
Someone's pulled the sword from the stone.
Where did you get it, Wart?
I, l-l pulled it out of an anvil that was on a stone... i-in, in a churchyard.
- That's funny!
- The lad's a young Samson!
You're making a fool of us, boy.
Now tell the truth.
- But I did, sir. Ow! Ooh!
- Then come on, prove it.
- Ouch!
- Back to the stone with you.
- Yes, prove it.
- Come on, prove it.
All right, boy, let's have the miracle.
Now, wait a minute!
Anyone can pull it once it's been pulled.
Go to it, Kay.
Give it all you got.
Put your back into it!
- Here now!
- Here, here, here!
- Push him and see.
- It's my turn. One side!
- Pull this thing.
- Hold on, that's not fair.
I say we let the boy try it.
That's what I say.
Give the boy a chance.
Go ahead, son.
It's a miracle ordained by heaven.
This boy is our king.
Well, by Jove.
- What's the lad's name?
- Eh, Wart.
Oh, uh, I mean Arthur.
- Hail King Arthur!
- Hail King Arthur! Long live the king!
- Long live King Arthur! Long live the king.
- I can't believe it!
- Ooh, forgive me, son.
- Hail King Arthur.
- Long live the king. Long live...
- Forgive me.
- King Arthur. Long live the king.
- Oh, please don't, sir.
- Kay, bow down to your king.
- Hail King Arthur.
Long live the king.
- Hail King Arthur.
- So at last, the miracle... had come to pass in that far off time upon New Year's Day... and the glorious rein of King Arthur was begun.
I can't be a king, Archimedes. I don't know anything about ruling a country.
I told you to leave the thing in the stone, boy.
I'll, I'll run away, that's what I'll do.
They'll just have to get somebody else.
Better take the side door, Wart.
Out the side door.
Hail King Arthur!
Long live the King!
There's another door. Over there, over there! Come on, come on!
Long live King Arthur!
Long li--
Looks-Looks like we're surrounded, boy.
Oh, Archimedes,
I wish Merlin was here.
Merlin! Merlin!
Oh, Merlin, you're back from Ber-Ber-Ber--
Bermuda?
Yes, back from Bermuda... and the 20th century.
And believe me, you can have it.
One big modern mess!
Alakazam!
I'm in an awful pickle.
I'm king.
Ooh, he pulled the sword from the stone.
Ha-ha!
Of course, of course!
King Arthur and his
Knights of the Round Table.
- Round table?
- Oh, uh, w-would you rather have a square one?
Oh, no. Round'll be fine.
Boy, boy, boy.
You'll become a great legend.
They'll be writing books about you for centuries to come.
Why, they might even make a motion picture about you.
- Motion picture?
- Oh.
Uh, well, um-- Uh, that's something like television... without commercials.
Hail King Arthur
Long live the King

Phew.
Ohh.
You didn't tell me you were gonna kill it.
Thanks, old pal.
Charge!
Never jump into a pile of leaves with a wet sucker.
Say, Charlie Brown, l've got a football.
How about practicing a few place kicks? l'll hold the ball and you come running and kick it.
Oh, brother. l don't mind your dishonesty half as much as l mind your opinion of me.
You must think l'm stupid.
-Oh, come on, Charlie Brown.
-No. l'll hold it steady.
No.
Please?
You just want me to come running up to kick that ball...
...so you can pull it away and see me land flat on my back and kill myself.
This time you can trust me.
See, here's a signed document...
...testifying that l promise not to pull it away. lt is signed. lt's a signed document. l guess if you have a signed document in your possession, you can't go wrong.
This year l'm really gonna kick that football.
Peculiar thing about this document: lt was never notarized.
Who are you writing to, Linus?
This is the time of year to write to the Great Pumpkin.
On Halloween night, the Great Pumpkin rises out of his pumpkin patch...
...and flies through the air with his bag of toys for all the children.
You must be crazy.
When are you going to stop believing in something that isn't true?
When you stop believing in that fellow with the red suit and the white beard...
...who goes, "Ho-ho-ho."
We're obviously separated by denominational differences.
Not again.
Writing a letter to a stupid pumpkin?
You make me the laughing stock of the neighborhood.
All they talk about is my little brother who always writes to the Great Pumpkin.
You better cut it out right now or l'll pound you.
There are three things l have learned never to discuss with people:
Religion, politics and the Great Pumpkin.
You're wasting your time.
The Great Pumpkin is a fake.
-What are you doing, Linus?
-l'd rather not say. You might laugh.
Oh, l'd never laugh at you, Linus.
You're so intelligent. l'm writing to the Great Pumpkin.
You say the cutest things.
On Halloween night, the Great Pumpkin rises out of the pumpkin patch...
...then flies through the air to bring toys to all the good little children everywhere.
Wouldn't you like to sit with me in the pumpkin patch on Halloween night...
-...and wait for the Great Pumpkin?
-Oh, l'd love to, Linus.
What's going on here?
What are you trying to do to my little sister?
And how do you think you're gonna mail that letter?
You can't possibly reach the mailbox, and l'm not gonna help you.
Hey, l got an invitation to a Halloween party. ls the invitation to Violet's party,
Charlie Brown?
Yes, it's the first time l've ever been invited to a party.
Charlie Brown, if you got an invitation, it was a mistake.
There were two lists, Charlie Brown: one to invite and one not to invite.
You must have been put on the wrong list.
A person should always choose a costume...
...which is in direct contrast to her own personality. ls Linus taking me to the party?
That stupid blockhead of a brother of mine is out in the pumpkin patch...
-...making his yearly fool of himself.
-Boy, is he strange.
But maybe there is a Great Pumpkin.
Every year, Linus misses tricks or treats, and then the Halloween party.
He'll never learn.
Do l get to go trick-or-treating this year, big brother?
-Sure, Sally.
-Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy.
-How do we do it?
-All you have to do is walk up to a house...
...ring the doorbell and say, "Tricks or treats."
-Are you sure it's legal?
-Of course it's legal. l wouldn't want to be accused of taking part in a rumble.
Oh, good grief.
-ls that you, Patty?
-No.
-Where is Charlie Brown?
-Here l am. l had a little trouble with the scissors.
They'll never guess it's me under here.
Hello, Pigpen. Glad you could make it.
How did you know it was me?
What in the world kind of a costume is that?
He's a World War l Flying Ace.
Now l've heard everything.
All right everybody, we'll go trick-or-treating...
...and then over to Violet's for the big Halloween party.
Hey, have you come to sing pumpkin carols?
You blockhead, you're gonna miss all the fun just like last year.
Don't talk like that.
The Great Pumpkin knows which kids have been good...
...and which kids have been bad.
-You'll be sorry.
-Oh, good grief.
He'll come here because l have the most sincere pumpkin patch...
...and he respects sincerity.
Do you really think he'll come?
Tonight, the Great Pumpkin rises out of the pumpkin patch...
...he flies through the air and brings toys to all the children of the world.
That's a good story.
You don't believe the story of the Great Pumpkin? l thought little girls always believed everything that was told to them. l thought little girls were innocent and trusting.
Welcome to the 20th century.
All right, once and for all, are you coming or are you staying?
We can't waste all night. l'm glad you came back, Sally.
We'll just sit here in this pumpkin patch...
...and you'll see the Great Pumpkin with your own eyes. lf you try to hold my hand, l'll slug you.
Each year, the Great Pumpkin rises out of the pumpkin patch...
...that he thinks is the most sincere.
He's gotta pick this one. He's got to. l don't see how a pumpkin patch could be more sincere than this one.
You can look all around and there's not a sign of hypocrisy.
Nothing but sincerity as far as the eye can see.
Trick or treat, money or eats!
Can l have an extra piece of candy for my stupid brother?
He couldn't come with us, because he's sitting in a pumpkin patch...
...waiting for the Great Pumpkin. lt's so embarrassing to have to ask for something extra for that blockhead Linus.
-l got five pieces of candy.
-l got a chocolate bar.
-l got a quarter.
-l got a rock.
Trick or treat.
-Gee, l got a candy bar.
-Boy, l got three cookies.
Hey, l got a package of gum. l got a rock.
Trick or treat. l got a popcorn ball.
-l got a fudge bar.
-l got a pack of gum. l got a rock.
By the way, whatever happened to the World War l Flying Ace?
Oh, he's probably getting ready to take off in his Sopwith Camel...
...on the next dawn patrol.
His mission is to find the Red Baron and shoot him down.
Here's the World War l Flying Ace...
...climbing into the cockpit of his Sopwith Camel.
"Contact," he shouts.
Aaahhh!
Ha!
Here's the World War l Flying Ace...
...imagining he's down behind enemy lines...
...making his way across the French countryside.
Come on, let's get going. lt's time for the Halloween party.
Has the Great Pumpkin been by?
What blockheads, sitting in a pumpkin patch in the middle of the night.
You've missed trick or treat...
...and now you're going to miss the Halloween party.
What a way to spend Halloween.
You think you're so smart.
Just wait until the Great Pumpkin comes.
He'll be here. You can bet on that.
Linus knows what he's talking about.
Linus knows what he's doing.
-All right, where is he?
-He'll be here. l hope so. l have my reputation to think of, you know.
And just think of all of the fun we're missing.
Just look, nothing but sincerity as far as the eye can see.
Charlie Brown, you'll have to model for us.
Me? You want me to model?
Sure, Charlie Brown, you'll be the perfect model.
Turn him around. lf we shape the eyes like this:
And the nose like this:
And the mouth like this:
Yes, that's the way.
Thank you, Charlie Brown.
You were a perfect model.
All right, all right, let's bob for apples.
This is the way to do it.
Yeah, Lucy, you should be good at this.
You have the perfect mouth for it.
Blah! My lips touched dog lips!
Blagh! Agh! Poisoned dog lips!
Blagh! Agh! lf anyone had told me l'd be waiting...
...in a pumpkin patch on Halloween night...
...l'd have said they were crazy.
Just think, Sally, when the Great Pumpkin rises out of the pumpkin patch...
...we'll be here to see him.
What's that?
What's that? l hear the Great Pumpkin.
There he is. There he is. lt's the Great Pumpkin.
He's rising up out of the pumpkin patch.
What happened?
Did l faint? What did he leave us?
Did he leave us any toys? l was robbed! l spent the whole night waiting for the Great Pumpkin...
...when l could have been out for tricks or treats.
Halloween is over, and l missed it!
You blockhead.
You kept me up all night waiting for the Great Pumpkin...
...and all that came was a beagle. l didn't get a chance to go out for tricks or treats.
And it was all your fault. l'll sue!
What a fool l was! l could have had candy apples and gum...
...and cookies and money and all sorts of things...
...but no, l had to listen to you.
You blockhead. What a fool l was.
Trick or treats come only once a year.
And l missed it by sitting in a pumpkin patch with a blockhead.
You owe me restitution!
You heard about fury and a woman scorned, haven't you?
Yes, l guess l have.
Well, that's nothing compared to the fury of a woman...
...who has been cheated out of tricks or treats.
Hey, aren't you gonna wait and greet the Great Pumpkin, huh? lt won't be long now. lf the Great Pumpkin comes, l'll still put in a good word for you.
Good grief, l said "if." l meant when he comes! l'm doomed.
One little slip like that can cause the Great Pumpkin to pass you by.
O Great Pumpkin, where are you?
Well, another Halloween has come and gone.
Yes, Charlie Brown. l don't understand it. l went trick-or-treating and all l got was a bag full of rocks. l suppose you spent all night in the pumpkin patch.
-And the Great Pumpkin never showed up?
-Nope.
Well, don't take it too hard, Linus. l've done a lot of stupid things in my life too.
Stupid? What do you mean, stupid?
Just wait till next year, Charlie Brown.
You'll see, next year at this same time...
...l'll find a pumpkin patch that is real sincere...
...and l'll sit in that pumpkin patch until the Great Pumpkin appears.
He'll rise out of that pumpkin patch...
...and he'll fly through the air with his bag of toys.
The Great Pumpkin will appear and l'll be waiting for him. l'll be there. l'll be sitting there in that pumpkin patch...
...and l'll see the Great Pumpkin.
Just wait and see, Charlie Brown. l'll see that Great Pumpkin. l'll see the Great Pumpkin.
Just you wait, Charlie Brown.
The Great Pumpkin will appear and l'll be waiting for him.
The Great Pumpkin will appear and l'll be waiting for him.
The computer wore tennis shoes
And a twinkle in his eye
Never met a groovier dude, an electric kind of guy
A socket shock
And suddenly socked him into a real cerebral high
Growing his mind into the kind
That leaves old Einstein wigging out behind
The computer wore tennis shoes
And a smile upon his face
Turnin' on every chick in town at a cosmothropic pace
A guy that crazed and amazed and otherwise dazed
The whole darn human race
Makin' the news, payin' his dues
That turned-on, uptight, flat out-of-sight
Totally together computer in tennis shoes
A guy that crazed and amazed and otherwise dazed
The whole darn human race
Makin' the news, payin' his dues
That turned-on, uptight, flat out-of-sight

Baa, baa, baa, baa
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
Baa, ba-ba-ba-ba, baa, baa
Professor Quigley, I'm sure that we all appreciate your interest in progress, but a computer.
Well, that is a luxury that we just cannot afford.
Dean Higgins, today, a computer can hardly be considered a luxury.
Oh, very well.
Then it is a necessity that we just cannot afford.
Now, unfortunately,
Medfield has quite a long list of necessities, and a computer just does not have a very high priority on that list.
Now, it's not that I'm old-fashioned.
You all know that I have an open ear for progress, and we do all that we can.
Why, when Mrs. Ferguson wanted live frogs for her biology lab, we went to the expense of live frogs.
Just last month, we purchased brand-new Bunsen burners for our chemistry class.
We're not dragging our feet, Quigley.
Why, I just put an order in today for two garbage disposals and an electric dishwasher
- Anything yet, Bradley?
- For our cafeteria.
- Not on us.
- Talk about modernization.
- Quig's still fighting the battle of the computer.
- And it's expensive, too.
How's he doing?
Yeah, that figures.
Aw, Higgins is weaseling out again.
What's he pulling this time?
Ah, he's got a new one.
- Hi, Dex.
- He says he's spending too much money for frogs and Bunsen burners and garbage disposals.
Thanks.
Quigley, you talk about $ 10, 000 as though it were 10 cents.
You just don't understand the problem.
Do you know what the telephone bill alone is here every month?
Take State.
I don't want to hear about State.
Yeah, but do you realize that they give an entire course in computer technology?
Now, I don't like to draw comparisons, gentlemen, but if we want to keep abreast of the times and raise our academic average,
We have got to modernize.
Modernization isn't everything.
Yes, uh, Regent Deeds.
Thank you very much.
That's... that's well-put.
Gentlemen, I, uh,
I wouldn't like this to get any further than this room, but frankly, we are down to the nitty-gritty on our budget.
The building program is bogged down.
The bankers in this town won't even answer my phone calls.
Why, we raffled off everything on the campus but the women's gym.
I tell you, gentlemen, it is tough to be the dean of a college today.
It's tough, tough, tough.
Unrest.
Everywhere you look, unrest.
Now, I wonder who's behind that.
Oh, uh, that part about the unrest, that's, uh, that's off the record, Mrs. Winifred.
So, Quigley, I'm sorry, but I'm certain that you understand our problem.
That's it.
They killed him.
Now, for the next item on the agenda...
Us?
Deadwood.
Us.
Well-put, Dean.
An apt title for the ne'er-do-wells who ought to be expunged from this...
Leonard...
The not-so-gifted students' needs are just as great as those of the gifted ones.
Quigley, this is a competitive educational institution.
All right, gentlemen, all right.
Now, um, Quigley, we do have certain ne'er-do-wells that must be seen to.
Therefore, I'm suggesting that the following students be placed on probation...
Probation is no substitute for catching the interest of the student, for firing his imagination.
- Yeah. - Come on,
Quig. - Thattaboy.
Timothy Balsen,
John Colligan, Roger Demney,
Henry Fathinger,
- Eeeeehh!
... Myles Harris,
Adam Jervins,
Keith Richards,
Dexter Reilly...
Ugh! They got me!
Dexter, it's not funny.
...Robert Ross,
Sliver Roth.
Sliver?
A man with a name like that has no business in a college.
Arnold Sandy,
Stanley Tyler...
He missed me.
He went through all the S's.
- Hey, that's right.
- Nice going.
What about Schuyler?
Oh, yes, of course.
Richard Schuyler.
Put him on there.
Richard Schuyler.
Thanks a lot.
He's sick.
No, it's just plain hate.
That man's all hate.
You know, Quig really cares, but the guy can't even reason with him.
Well, how can you reason with a guy who lives in the Dark Ages?
Hey, wouldn't it be terrific if we swing it for old Quig?
Well, swing what?
The computer.
Hey, yeah.
It'd drive Higgins right over the edge.
You guys must be dreaming.
The guy who's selling it wants 10 grand.
Who is that, Bradley?
A.J. Arno.
That big shot, uh, who runs the
A.J. Arno investment company, huh?
Well, he's not such a big shot.
I mean, I think if we went down there and talked to him, we could get him to donate it to the college.
Aw, man, listen, I'll lay you any kind of bet we couldn't even get in there to see A.J. Arno.
Well, I don't know about that.
I used to work for him.
Dexter, you just cleaned up at night.
Arno wouldn't even remember you.
What do you mean he wouldn't remember me?
Well, I always used to bump into him in the elevator and halls and stuff.
And he always said hello... kind of.
You know, that's not too bad an idea.
You know, big firms... they're always donating things to universities.
No. No trouble at all,
Wexler.
I'm glad you boys dropped by.
Now, don't get me wrong.
I, uh, I'd love to donate the computer to Medfield.
I mean, I love that school.
I love the football team, the track team, the golf team.
It's a wonderful place, but, uh, well, uh, I already give them
$20,000 a year.
Gee, Mr. Arno, we didn't realize that you'd already donated.
Well, believe me, if I didn't give them all that money,
I'd be glad to donate the computer.
But honestly, uh, nobody could expect me to do both, now, could they?
- No. -
No. - No.
Wait a minute.
Maybe I can work something out.
Look, just give me a little time, huh?
Sure.
You know, I like you kids.
I like your spunk.
I like your get-up-and-go.
I like the idea of a student delegation coming to see me.
Makes me feel good... up here.
- Bye.
- Thanks.
Goodbye. Goodbye, boys.
Good to see you.
Thanks a lot for giving us your time, Mr. Arno.
Well, A.J. Arno never forgets an old employee.
You just come back any time, Lester.
Um, it's... it's Dexter.
Ah, yes, Dexter.
O'Brien...
Ready with yesterday's stuff?
Yeah, just about, sir.
- Well, run it.
- All right.
Hey, they did pretty good with the horses.
750 isn't bad.
That crap table figure okay?
525. That's real good for The Palace.
Looks like a real good day for Applejack.
Yeah, real good.
Incidentally, don't send that 20 grand to Medfield.
Don't? But you made that pledge.
Don't you think...
Don't worry about it.
It's all taken care of.
Now, 102 goes right over there.
And, uh, 149 also over there.
146, right.
Okay. Right this way now,
Baxter.
Easy through the door, you guys. Easy.
That's it.
Right in there.
Now, what do we have here?
Number 125.
Okay, boys, right over there.
- Right.
- Let's go.
Easy now.
Take it easy.
What a slave driver.
Yeah, if he'd been in charge of that Russian 5-year plan, they'd have made it.
You know, it's a great idea doing something for the school, but next time let's do something easy, like hijacking a Cuban airliner.
Yeah.
Okay, boys, now we need number 126.
Professor, can we just take a few seconds off?
My back's killing me.
Oh, sure.
Take as much time as you want.
Uh, Dexter, there's a box of tools in the back of my car.
Would you get that for me, please?
Sure. Right away, professor.
Good.
- Dean Higgins. - Good morning,
Dean. - Good morning, Dean.
Hi, Deano.
Oh, hello, there,
Dean Higgins.
Nice of you to visit us.
Of course, we're not really set up here yet, but very soon.
Heh heh.
"Dear Dean Higgins, first of all,
"I would like to congratulate you on your splendid student delegation. "
Well, that's wonderful.
I see.
Uh...
"And you will understand
"that since we have made such a valuable donation,
"we must withhold our yearly cash contribution.
Yours in the interest of higher education, A.J. Arno. "
Well, this... this is a dreadful mistake, sir.
You can say that again.
And I'm gonna tell you this much, Quigley... in the future, I'm gonna be watching them.
But you can't blame the boys, sir.
Why, i-it's Mr. Arno who's acted in bad faith.
Oh, good faith, bad faith, who cares?
They've cost this school
Well, not altogether,
Dean.
We still have the computer.
Oh, shut up!
Higher education.
Hey, pretty great about the computer, huh?
You know,
I don't like to brag, but if it hadn't been for the fact that I used to work there...
Him I'm gonna watch most of all.
Well, what's he gonna be watching me for?
The elements of a computer are input, memory, control, arithmetic and logic, and output.
And I think we can see, demonstrated from these charts, that man has done a rather admirable job of imitating the human brain.
And, uh, even though it's an imitation, in many ways, the machine we've developed can operate more efficiently than we can ourselves.
Now, in the past couple of weeks,
I've been, uh, working on a small experiment, uh, which is intended to show how we can be replaced by a computer.
Hey... this may be a way of getting rid of Dean Higgins.
We live in hope, Dexter.
Now, let's suppose that your parents are going away for the weekend, and they leave you the following instructions...
"If it's raining tomorrow morning when you wake up,
"you are to close the windows,
"open the door and let the cat in, phone the grocer and have him send over the following list of groceries. "
All right?
Well, you wake up in the morning, and it is raining.
And being the conscientious and reliable young people
I know you to be, you promptly forget to do it.
Now, well, actually,
I'm sure you would do it, but let's see if a computer could also do it.
Now, this is a rain gauge, and it's, uh, sitting on a roof of a building.
Now, when the water falls into this gauge, it sends a signal to the logic unit of the computer, which immediately notifies the memory bank of the computer to seek out its instructions for a rainy day.
The memory bank, in turn, activates the electronic circuits, the window closes, the door opens... hopefully the cat comes in... and the automatic telephone goes into action, right?
Well, let's see.
The rain... falls.
Computerized male voice:
This is s recording.
Please deliver the following groceries to 445 Annex Street... one pound of bacon, two dozen eggs,
4 quarts of milk.
Hmm. Well, I... that's enough of that.
Uh, thank you.
Thank you.
Well, so much for the speed of the computer.
Now, another very important feature is its infallible memory.
Before this computer was owned by the A.J. Arno Company, it used to be employed by the Space Research Center at the Pacific Institute of Technology.
And they were kind enough to send us this magnetic tape, which will call forth from the computer solutions to a series of problems that would occur on a simulated flight to the planet Saturn.
Now, mind you, it was 20 years ago that this program was operational.
20 years.
Well...
If you'll watch the center panel, please.
Hey, Quig.
Hey.
Well, it seems like our flight to Saturn will be a little delayed.
Your attention, please.
This is Dean Higgins.
Now, the State General
Collegiate Classification tests will be held tomorrow at 11:00.
Now, as many of you know, we came in 36th last year.
And, now, I think we could get out there and improve upon that position.
Thank you.
36th?
Gee.
You know, Dexter, there are only 37 colleges in the state.
Gee, I wonder who we beat.
I don't know.
What happened, professor?
Oh, it's a part in the logic activator unit.
It, uh, should be replaced, but I can't get over to
Capital Electronics today.
Well, listen,
I'll get it for you.
Oh, I wouldn't expect you to go all the way over there, Dexter.
That's 70 miles away.
Oh, that's okay.
I've got nothing to do.
You have nothing to do?
Didn't you just hear?
That classification test is coming up tomorrow.
Oh, yeah, but I know all that stuff.
Cars and buses going from place to place.
Car "A" goes 70 miles an hour.
Car "B" goes 60.
One guy stops for lunch for 20 minutes.
And who gets to Chicago first? I got it all, prof.
Yes, I'm sure you do have it all, Dexter, but if I were you, I would look it over again this afternoon.
Aw, honest, professor.
It wouldn't do any good.
I'm up to here with it.
Let me go to Marshfield.
Believe me, the drive and fresh air will do me good.
It'll give my brain a chance to ventilate.
It couldn't be "A."
The answer to the last two questions was "A."
- Would never have three A's in a row.
It's gotta be "B" or "C."
I haven't seen a "C" for a long time.
It's gotta be "C" then.
Got to be "C."
"A"?! That's three A's in a row.
That's impossible.
How do they ever expect anybody to figure this out?
3 at 8-02-30.
Applejack Rainbow Lodge animals 750, tables 480, amusements 624.
Applejack Pompey Palace,
- Dexter? Dexter?!
Dexter, are you okay?
Yeah.
Did you wake me up to ask me if I was okay?
Nah, you were beeping.
Burping?
No, beeping.
Oh, that's good.
- Hey, Dexter...
- Uh...
What'd you do to the computer anyway?
W... nothing. I just tried to put in that part, and I got this terrific shock.
Well, there must be a short in it somewhere.
Yeah, there sure is.
I had to call in these computer people.
They can't get a spark out of it.
Well
I'm sorry, professor.
Well...
Sorry I'm late, prof.
Yeah. Well, move along, boys. Move along.
Now, ladies and gentlemen, this is a speed test.
And that means if you have trouble with any question, skip it and move on to the next one because you'll be graded on the total number of questions you answer correctly.
Is that clear?
All right.
You may begin.
Dexter, come on.
Start the test.
Funny guy.
Dexter, cut it out.
I tell you, Quigley, he cheated.
It's just as simple as that.
Spending $20 for a doctor.
That's ridiculous.
He didn't cheat,
Dean Higgins.
Something has happened to Dexter.
Now, we usually allow an hour and a half for that test.
And since I've been at this school, nobody's ever finished it.
Dexter finished it in 41/2 minutes, and he didn't make a mistake.
Man: Professor Quigley?
Yes.
I can't go on TV!
I don't even want to go on TV!
Listen, at this rate, you're gonna faint in front of all those people.
Dexter, it isn't that easy.
Things aren't the same.
You have a responsibility now.
- Yeah. -
Yeah. - Yeah.
Listen, Dexter, it's almost like playing a game.
Now, I know the first few minutes are gonna be tough.
But, listen, after you answer a few questions, you're gonna get your confidence.
Don't worry about it, man.
And the thing to remember is that you're smarter than all those people.
- That's right.
- That's right.
I am?
That doesn't make any sense.
There are going to be
37 million viewers, Quigley.
I tell you, he'd better come through.
No question.
Oh, Mayor Collins.
Nice to see you, Mayor.
Take a seat right down front, Mayor.
Ha! It's the mayor.
I tell you, Quigley,
Medfield has really brought out the fat cats tonight. Ha!
Mayor Collins and there's
Councilman Cooper over there and Supervisor Straight and there's, uh, oh, he's not anything.
Oh, there's Dean Collingsgood in the booth.
Hello, Dean!
Dean Coll... what's he doing here?
Well, it's perfectly natural for a dean of the state university to be here.
Well, I don't like it.
Every time I see him, I have to hear about his building program.
Building, building, building.
It's enough to make you sick.
- Hello, Eugene. Hello.
- Dean, nice of you to come.
Say, what about that boy wonder of yours?
I've been hearing great things.
Well, you know, at Medfield, the scholastic...
Nice to see you.
I would have gotten over here sooner, but I've been tied up planning our new science building.
Building, building, build...
You know, Quigley, sometimes I think
I should have taken up contracting instead of education.
Say, Eugene, I was talking to some of our faculty today, and we thought it might be a good idea if we had a sort of a
Dexter Reilly rally at State.
So many of our teachers want to meet him...
No. I-I mean, he's all booked up.
Uh-huh. Well, we can work something out.
Man: 30 seconds, ladies and gentlemen.
Oh, I'd better take my seat.
I've been invited to sit in the control room.
In the control room.
I tell you, he's trying to steal that boy away from us.
Oh, you're exaggerating a little,
Dean Higgins. I'm sure of it.
You don't understand him,
Quigley. The man is greedy.
He's up to his throat in state money, and still he's greedy.
On behalf of the major networks,
I would like to extend thanks to our learned panel who has come here tonight from all parts of our land in the interests of science and education.
And, of course, special thanks to the one who is the reason we are gathered here... the wizard of Medfield
College... Dexter Reilly.
- Yay! -
Yay! - Yay!
Each of our learned guests will be allowed 3 questions.
Our first questions will be from Dr. Rufus Schmidt, head of the Department of Higher
Mathematics at Purdue University.
Dr. Schmidt.
Thank you.
Mr. Reilly, you're acquainted with the mathematical subject of calculus?
Well, I...
I, uh, I guess I am.
I kind of looked at the text this morning.
I see.
Mr. Reilly, using the fundamental theorem of advanced calculus, and applying the formula that the square of a distance from the origin to "P" is equal to "X" squared plus
"Y" squared plus "Z" squared.
Now, could you tell us the point of the plane where X + 4, Y-1, Z =26?
- The point is where "X" is equal to 3, "Y" is equal to 4, and "Z" is equal to -1.
The answer's quite right.
You see?
He's getting his confidence.
I told you.
Your next question,
Dr. Schmidt.
Mr. Reilly, my next question is an exercise in mental gymnastics.
Could you please tell us what 13 to the 9th power would be and then give us the square root of that product?
13 to the 9th power would be
The square root of that product would be...
I'm afraid that's quite correct.
Hey.
Man: Congratulations,
Mr. Reilly.
I must say, that was really something.
Yes, I suppose it was, but wouldn't it speed things up a bit if we could save the applause till the end?
We've wasted 38 seconds on it already.
Yes, uh, I'm sure the audience would be glad to comply.
Good.
Your third question,
Dr. Schmidt.
Mr. Reilly... assuming that the population of the United States increases on a geometric progression...
Gentlemen, please.
This is our third question in mathematics.
I hope you're aware that I'm perfectly equipped to go into other fields.
Of course.
Uh, perhaps now we could hear from, uh, Dr. Seigel, professor of foreign languages at Lansing University.
Getting his confidence is one thing, but this is ridiculous.
I liked him better the way he was.
We're awaiting the arrival of the phenomenal Dexter Reilly.
We're awaiting the arrival of the phenomenal Dexter Reilly.
It promises to be exciting, so stay with us as our cameras follow Dexter Reilly on his journey through Gotham.
There's been s buzz of excitement around the big city this past week, Ladies and gentlemen.
Everywhere you go, you hear the same question... is Dexter Reilly for real?
Now the landing platform is in position, the door is open.
Should be any second now.
And there he is!
- He's out of sight.
- He sure is.
Well...
Now, uh...
Uh, Mr. Reilly's being greeted by two young Ladies who came all the way from
Yonkers just to greet him.
This is
Priscilla Cummings...
Queen of the Yonkers
Botanical Society,
- and her lady-in-waiting...
- That dirty rat!
I always knew if he had any brains, he'd be dangerous.
Hey, Annie, wait a second.
Just a second.
Look, I know Dexter's acting kind of weird, but it's kind of understandable.
I mean, all of a sudden, like, he's the smartest guy in the whole world, and everybody's catering to him.
Well, you're telling me.
Look at that crowd,
Quigley.
What a boon for the college.
But, you know, w-we weren't thinking, Quigley.
Why couldn't the boy have been carrying a Medfield pennant?
Don't you think that would have been pushing it a little, sir?
Yes?
Winifred:
Mr. Clodshoe is here.
- Clodshoe?
- From Universal Encyclopedias.
- Oh, tell him we already have a set.
Salesmen.
That's all we need.
We can't pay for what we have now.
He's no salesman, sir.
He's the president of Universal Encyclopedia.
I don't... the president?
Sure. You know, they're the people who sponsor the "College Knowledge" program.
The quiz program where they ask the questions from the encyclopedia, and they give away
What have I done, Quigley?
Mr. Clodshoe, it's a pleasure to meet you, sir.
It's a real pleasure.
Thank you.
Who are you?
Who am...
That's good.
I like that.
Who am I?
And I like that set of encyclopedias of yours.
I like it... remarkable set.
Remarkable.
Displaying again his remarkable intellectual prowess,
Dexter Reilly was able to converse with each delegate to the U.N. in his own tongue.
Speaking in French, the official language of the U.N.,
Dexter Reilly has informed the international group that he must now go inside.
They're waiting for him in the Security Council.
Earlier today, Dr. Suzuki of the
International School of Languages stated that with s computer-type brain such as Dexter Reilly has, he'll soon be able to master every Language the world has ever known.
I think he's given s good indication of that today.
Professor Mertins, we need that boy.
He can wrap up that "College
Knowledge" program for us.
Should be a simple matter to get him transferred to State.
We have so much more to offer.
Of course, but we can't take any chances.
See if you can get
Coach Parsons in here.
Then we'll send off a wire to Dexter Reilly.
Parsons?
The football coach?
This is a problem of recruitment.
I need the best advice
I can get.
Ladies and gentlemen,
Dexter Reilly is now at the
Long Street Jewelry Salon, where he's been invited to observe the cutting of the Calcutta Blue.
I, uh, I hate to disturb you, sir.
Uhh, just a minute, Quigley.
This is exciting.
And I wish that announcer would raise his voice.
You'd think Arnold Palmer was putting.
Now, Sigmund Van Dyke, the world's foremost diamond cutter, is in charge of the operation.
Tremendous.
Well, t-this is rather important, sir.
It's about the "College
Knowledge" program.
That's no problem.
Dexter will chew up those encyclopedias.
We'll beat every team in the state.
It seems that Mr. Van Dyke is explaining the operation to the boy wonder.
Only maybe we don't have Dexter.
What?
He hasn't registered for the spring semester.
We've gotta do something!
We need that boy!
Winifred, get out
Dexter's itinerary!
Find out when his plane arrives!
Quigley, how could you let this happen?!
The first operation of cutting the diamond in two exact halves is the most important.
I think Mr. Van Dyke has now made s decision.
Wait a minute!
I beg you...
I beg your pardon.
It seems there's an area of disagreement as to where the diamond should be cut.
Keep that kid away from me.
Wh-iii-pppp!
Yeah, Mr. Arno, but I'm kind of busy right now.
Mr. Arno: Well, I hated to interrupt you, but I've got some good news.
Oh?
I think I've found a spot for you in my organization.
- Well, gee, I really hadn't given much thought
- to what I'm gonna do.
- I tell you what, I'll pick you up at the airport.
We'll have a nice, relaxing afternoon,
- then maybe talk a little business.
How's that?
- That sounds fine. Just a minute.
Pardon us, boys.
Pardon us.
- What's happening, please?
- Come on, you guys.
Hello, professor, how are you?
- Welcome home, boy.
- Dean Higgins. How are you?
Let me get this.
I know you've been very busy, son, and it's probably just an oversight, but you haven't registered for the second quarter.
Now, if you can stop by the school, I'm sure that we could take care of that.
Well, you see, Dean, there is a problem.
A problem?
Yes, I don't know whether
I want to enroll at Medfield for the second quarter.
Well, w-where else would you possibly go?
Well, don't get me wrong. Uh, it's not that, uh, I don't like Medfield.
I like it. I like the guys and the teachers and I even like you.
There's Mr. Arno.
Excuse me.
He likes me.
Isn't that wonderful?
Dexter! Hi!
What's happening?
What's happening?
Whoo!
Dexter?
Where are you going in such a hurry?
Yeah.
Mr. Arno wants to see me this afternoon.
Well, so do we.
Yeah, man.
Everybody's been waiting for you to come home.
We're going to the lake this afternoon.
Annie, are you kidding?
Mr. Arno's a very important man in this town.
I just can't turn my back on him.
Well, Dexter, he'll understand.
Yeah, come on, Dex.
And look, I'd like you to come, too.
I'm sorry, Annie.
Mr. Arno arranged for this meeting yesterday.
I'll see you later, guys.
I gotta go.
What's with him?
I don't know, Pete.
But I think if we're going to have anything to do with Dexter anymore, we'll have to make an appointment.
Yeah.
Little champagne,
Dexter?
Best there is.
$34 a bottle.
No, thanks.
Uh, not right now.
Ah, healthy.
I like that.
Well, who do you like in the first race, kid?
Well, according to all the information, it should be the number 8 horse, Market Doodle.
Market Doodle?! Ha!
Boss, that horse is a pig.
It ain't got a chance in this race.
Well, it's just a matter of analyzing all the information... the weight, distance, past performance.
And Market Doodle does figure out to be the best horse.
Bet $200 on Market Doodle.
Boss, how can you listen to this kid?
He don't know nothin' about horses.
I have been listening to you for years.
Do as I tell you.
Okay. Sweetheart...
I don't know.
I think you're flipping.
$200, Market Doodle, the number 8 horse.
Announcer: Flag is up.
And there they go.
Market Doodle comes slowly.
French Suzie is going to best
First Orbit, second, Cottontop, third on the outside,
Maladjusted, fourth, Nobody's Baby,
Clean Clem, Rare Addition, then... Snoopy's Pal and Market Doodle.
Down the backstretch, it's First Orbit in front, between horses, by s head.
Cottontop is second on the rail, by s neck,
French Suzie, third, by s length,
Nobody's Baby is fourth, and Market Doodle is far back.
Around the far turn, it's Maladjusted in front on the inside by s head.
French Suzie is second by s neck.
First Orbit, third.
Cottontop is fourth.
Nobody's Baby and Clean Clem turning for home.
It's First Orbit in front on the inside by s head.
Cottontop is second by two lengths.
French Suzie, third,
Maladjusted, fourth, and Market Doodle is closing much ground on the outside.
Come on, boy!
It's French Suzie in front on the outside by s head.
First Orbit is second by s half-length.
Cottontop, third by s length.
Maladjusted is fourth.
And here comes Market Doodle in the middle of the track.
- French Suzie in front,
- Come on! Come on!
First Orbit is second,
Cottontop, third.
And Market Doodle flying on the outside.
- French Suzie...
- Come! Come on!
Market Doodle moving up on the outside.
Here comes Market Doodle.
Come on, boy!
Come on!
French Suzie and Market Doodle...
And Market Doodle is the winner by s nose.
Hey, honey, cash 'em in.
Cash 'em in.
Uh, you bum.
I never seen anyone win that much money all at once, straight.
Yeah, not a bad afternoon.
Well, I gotta split.
I got a chamber meeting tonight.
Chillie will take you to dinner.
Take him down to Garibaldis.
They got good pizza there.
- Hi, there.
- Hey, Tom.
Here, you drive, kid.
I'm right over here.
Hey, thanks.
Oh, Dexter, can I have a word with you?
Uh, we are in a hurry,
Dean.
It's very important.
It's about your enrollment.
I brought the short form. I think this will be an ideal time to discuss it.
I'm sorry, Dean, but I'm afraid we'll have to talk about it some other time, okay?
Well, I really think we should talk about it tonight.
Sorry.
Is that all right with you?
Impossible.
You haven't been talking to Dean Collingsgood, have you?
- Not yet.
- Wh...
Not yet?
What are you doing here?
Well, uh, I-I'm absolutely f... I'm fl...
Isn't this
Professor Stanley's house?
There was supposed to be a dinner party in my honor at Professor Stanley's.
You're not fooling me,
Collingsgood.
I know what you're doing here.
It's a raid!
Ladies and gentlemen, we're police officers.
All the exits are guarded.
We urge everybody to remain calm.
It is my duty to inform you of your Constitutional rights.
You have the right to remain silent.
You have the right to have an attorney present before and during all questioning.
If you wish an attorney and cannot afford one, the state will refer an attorney.
For those of you...
Where do you think you're going, buster?
Buster?
My name is not Buster.
This is just what
I thought it was.
This is a case of mistaken identity.
Ha!
How I ever let you lead me into such a mess!
Lead you?
You're the one that tried to steal the boy.
You ought to be in jail, not me.
Collingsgood, you're acting like this is the first time a thing like this has ever happened.
- Hey, you okay, kid?
- I can remember the time you stole "Breakaway" Jones from me.
Hey, come on.
Don't be depressed, will you?
Spending the night in jail ain't so bad.
Look at me. I've been in and out 100 times.
It's not that.
It's not the alumni that's trying to steal Dexter.
It's you.
Man: You know,
I don't understand you.
You should be the happiest guy in the world.
I've been going to the track all my life.
I never once met a guy who could pick eight races in a row, never.
Dexter, you and me could have the world at our feet here.
Collingsgood: I'm just trying to be fair to the boy.
I mean, with his capabilities, why should he stay at an academic fleabag like Medfield?
Well, it was that academic fleabag that taught Dexter Reilly everything he knows.
You just want him for that
"College Knowledge" program, and you know it.
You know... everyone's just out for himself.
It was like that everywhere I went.
Everyone's just out for himself.
Oh, you mean those guys?
Don't let them bother you, man.
You stick with me.
Who are you thinking of,
Mr. Walski?
Oh, come on, will you, kid?
You're supposed to be smart, some sort of genius.
Don't you think everybody thinks about themself?
Okay, kid, you've been bailed out.
There, you see? I told you
Mr. Arno would come through.
Just the boy.
Oh, u-uh, Dexter, tell the boss, uh, not to forget I'm in here, huh?
Uh, Dexter...
Uh, Dexter, do you suppose that you could, uh...
Dean Higgins, I don't know what I'm gonna do.
- Man: 92... 93... 94...
Will you all shut up for just one minute?!
Quiet!
Well, the bail for Dexter Reilly's $ 100.
You've only got $97.50 here.
You owe $2.50 more.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute!
Now, if you'll all promise to get out of here,
I'll pay the $2.50 myself.
Dean Higgins,
I'll come by tomorrow and fill out that application.
Oh, that'll be wonderful.
Hey!
What's happening?!
The jailbird.
Thanks for bailing me out, guys.
- Sure, man.
- Yeah, sure.
A lot of things have been happening to me lately.
Yeah, I...
I guess I've been acting kind of weird.
But I guess the worst thing I did was to forget who my friends really were.
- Aw, come on.
- What are friends for?
I'd just like to say that I'm sorry.
- Come on.
- What are friends for, man?
Come on, man.
Annie...
Annie, I, uh...
What?
Heck, I don't know what
I was doing.
That's okay.
Come on, let's go.
That's fantastic.
You did the S's in...
8 minutes and 18 seconds.
That beat the R's by 91/2 seconds.
And there were 1,200 pages in the S's and only 1,000 in the R's.
I picked up 22.68%.
I'll get it.
Oh, hi,
Professor Quigley.
Hello, Bradley.
Is Dexter here?
Yeah, he's just boning up
- for the "College Knowledge" program.
- Time. Mark.
Page 4, paragraph 16, line 398, word 4,001.
Hi, professor.
Hello, Dexter. Boys.
Well, I'm... I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to interrupt anything.
Oh, don't worry.
Heck, these are a cinch.
Ah, you can't believe this guy.
Yes. Yes. I-I know.
Well, it's just, uh, a little thing, Dexter.
It, uh, seems that we need, uh, three more members for the panel.
I see.
And, uh, Dean Higgins sent over a list of suggestions.
Oh.
For you.
These guys are smart, all right.
Well, you know me, Quigley,
I'm not a proud man.
If, uh, Dexter doesn't like my suggestions, then he can have anybody he wants.
Good.
Who does he want?
Schuyler, Henry, and Myles.
Hmm. Schuyler, Henry, and Myles.
That seems like a perfectly logical s...
Schuyler, Henry, and Myles?
Oh, no.
Eh, well, they're very good friends of his, sir.
Well, I don't care.
And I'm afraid that if we tried to force anyone else on him, he might...
He might.
Y- You're right. He might.
He would, too.
I mean, we want to keep that boy happy.
But Schuyler, Henry, and Myles.
Well, I'm not sure about the answer to the third part.
But the answer to part one is "The Battle of Thermopylae," and the answer to part two is
"The Naval Battle of Salamis. "
Well, Lockhurst has answered two parts out of three correctly.
And that's good for 20 points.
Now we have a question concerning Greek art directed to our Medfield panel.
For 10 points each, please name the three greatest sculptors of The Golden Age of Greece.
- Okay, Schuyler, you answer this one.
- What?!
It doesn't look good if I answer all the questions.
Now, there were three sculptors.
Phidias, who did a statue of Athena, and Praxiteles, who specialized in human figures, then there was Myron, who sculpted the figure of a discus-thrower, kind of like the best thing he ever done.
- Okay. You got it?
- Got what?
Gentlemen, you have 20 seconds.
Well, tell him.
I think I misunderstood the question, sir.
You tell him, Henry.
W- Who's that guy,
Merlin?
Not Merlin, Myron.
Is he the guy who threw the shot put?
It wasn't a shot put.
It was a discus.
And he didn't throw it.
He was a sculptor.
Gentlemen, your time is almost up.
I think I misunderstood the answer, sir.
You did?
That's the last time
I'll do that.
We have time for one more question directed to our
Medfield panel.
Gentlemen, these are the works of the famous Marcel Duchamp as found in the collection of the Philadelphia Museum of Art.
Thank you, Miss Ackerman.
For 10 points each, please identify.
Number one is called
"Portrait of Chess Players. "
It was painted in 1911.
Number two is called
"The Bride," and it was painted in 1912.
And number three is called
"A Nude Descending a Staircase. "
It was also painted in 1912.
That's right on the button.
Very good.
That answer is absolutely correct.
Next week, Medfield will meet
Franklin in the semifinals.
So until then, good night to you from Universal Encyclopedia, your passport to knowledge.
You guys were great.
We're gonna win.
Thanks. Hey.
"A Nude Descending a Staircase. "
- Boy, that'd never make Playboy.
- Ha.
Oh, Dean Collingsgood, nice to see you.
You're scouting,
I imagine.
Can hardly blame you.
It should be Medfield and State in the finals.
Oh, what an exciting match that'll be.
And I would like to say right at the beginning,
I hope that the better team may win.
Withdraw him, Eugene.
I beg your pardon.
If you had an ounce on integrity, you'd withdraw him.
Withdraw whom?
That boy.
It's unfair.
He's an intellectual freak!
Now, Dean Collingsgood, control yourself.
I know how you feel, but you can't win them all.
Unfortunately, this year,
Medfield has the horses.
Hmm.
Are those the horses?
Well, actually,
Collingsgood, they're just, uh, part of the team.
For 10 points each, could you give us the highest and lowest points in South America?
The highest point is Mount
Aconcagua, which is 22,934 feet.
The lowest point is Salinas Grandes, which is 131 feet below sea level.
Both locations are in Argentina.
That is absolutely correct.
20 points for Medfield.
How do you like that?
I could have had that kid in my organization.
Hey, I didn't try to get him arrested, you know.
He won't even answer the phone when I call.
But, boss, how did I know there was gonna be a raid?
I mean,
I didn't think that...
Will you shut up?
I want to hear this.
However, we have time for one more question, and I will direct it to our Medfield panel.
The Department of Agriculture stated last year the people of the United States consume more apples than any other country.
Some of that consumption was in the liquid form.
Can you give the phrase in slang for the central unfrozen portion in a container of frozen cider?
Applejack.
That's absolutely right.
Applejack.

- Hey, boss, I had nothin' to do with this. I swear. Nothin'.
Applejack, Pompey Palace,
138, Feb. 29.

Applejack, Charlie Place.
Are you all right,
Mr. Reilly?
Yeah, sure.
What was I talking about?
Mr. Arno, if you could please relax for just a little...
All right. Out, out.
Just get out of here.
But... But... But what do I do with this?
Chissum City Social Club.
Hello. This is Applejack.
Oh, yes, sir.
Shut down right now.
Everybody and everything out of there.
I don't want a trace of that operation left.
Shut down? Why? What's the matter? Somethin' wrong?
Just do as you're told.
I'll keep in touch.
Whatever you say.
Boys, out!
We gotta put that kid on ice.
Look, we need time to figure this out.
Hello? Long distance?
I want the Pompey Palace on
Franklin Road in Charlottesville.
Yeah.
You know, if that kid hadn't been stopped, he'd have mentioned every joint
I own in this state.
Pick him up.
Take him out to the Hancock place.
Right.
What?
No, I don't know the area code.
Hello, Dexter.
What are you doing here?
Well, Mr. Arno figured you might be overworking yourself.
He thought you could use a little vacation in the country.
Go ahead.
Start the car.
You know, fresh air and stuff.
Look, Mr. Arno's not my boss, and I don't need any vacation.
Dexter, start the car.
Well, drive.
I just don't know what could have happened, Lieutenant.
He was supposed to be at my house about 8:30 last night, and he never showed up.
And nobody's seen him since.
Well, we've checked all over.
He hasn't been in an accident nor has he been arrested.
Lieutenant, I wonder if he could have had an attack of amnesia.
With that peculiar brain of his, he might just have wandered off somewhere.
Could be miles away by now.
Mm-hmm. I've alerted the state patrol to be on the lookout for his car.
And if they don't pick him up pretty soon, then I'm afraid we'll have to suspect foul play.
Hmm. Foul play, huh?
Well, that's it!
He's been kidnapped.
Collingsgood has kidnapped him.
Collingsgood?
You don't mean Dean
Collingsgood over at State?
Well, yes, of course.
Oh, don't you see it,
Quigley?
I mean, if Dexter isn't back tomorrow for that "College Knowledge" program, then Springfield State will get the $ 100,000 grant.
We don't stand a chance without him.
Uh, wait a minute. Wait a minute.
The dean of a college, a kidnapper?
Well, you don't know him.
You don't know him at all.
The man is ruthless.
He gets all that taxpayers' money and still he's ruthless.
Y- Yeah. Uh-huh. I see.
Well, we'll, uh, we'll check it out.
I guess that'll be all for now.
If any of you hear anything, uh, be sure to let me know.
Thank you.
Pete... I just don't think
Dexter would go wandering off without telling anyone.
I don't think the lieutenant does either.
Let's stop by my place for a second.
I just thought of something.
Applejack, Chissum City
Social Club
137, Feb. 29.
Animals 740, tables 600, amusements 500.
Applejack, Pompey Palace
138, Feb. 29.
Animals 740.
Applejack, Charlie...
Gee, all those places and always "Applejack. "
That's weird.
When I played the tapes to Dexter, he didn't remember.
He didn't have the foggiest idea what they were.
Maybe it doesn't mean anything.
Nah, they got to.
Look, he was on TV for 15 weeks, and nothing happens to him.
Then all of a sudden, he mentions "Applejack," and wham!
Just like that, he's missing.
Pete, I just don't get it.
What?
Look, Dexter glances through an encyclopedia, he remembers every single word.
He browses through a book on an oriental language, and then speaks it fluently, remembering every accent.
He remembers everything he's ever seen, touched, heard, or read in his whole life.
How come he doesn't remember this?
Pete, it doesn't make sense.
Unless... unless he'd never read it or seen it or heard it before.
It was in the computer.
Of course.
When he got that big, giant shock, he was not only able to remember and think like a computer, but all the information that was in the computer was zapped into him, and he didn't even know it.
And now he blurts it all over the TV.
W... that's why he's missing.
A.J., Applejack.
A.J. Arno.
A code name...
- Applejack.
... for something, something he doesn't want anybody to know about.
Hi.
Tables, animals, amusements.
Pete, nobody would believe this but you and me.
Hi.
I don't care who believes it, just as long as we find Dexter.
Hey, Schuyler, will you do a favor for me?
Sure.
All right. Take these tapes down to the police station.
Tell them if they look up these places, they're gonna find out what Applejack is up to.
Applejack is Arno, and he's probably a crook.
And the reason why we know
Applejack is Arno is 'cause it came from the computer into Dexter's head.
And that's why Dexter doesn't remember it.
Come on.
138, Feb. 29, animals 740.
Applejack, Charlie Place...
That's why Pete remembered that Applejack was Arno.
Arno?
Yeah, because it was the only thing he couldn't remember.
Pete couldn't remember?
No, no, no. Dexter.
And that's how he remembered.
Because he couldn't?
Exactly.
Yeah.
Well, uh, thank you,
Mr. Schuyler.
Sure.
Oh. Incidentally, if I go out of town or anything,
I'll be sure to notify you.
Meantime, I'll be on the "College Knowledge" program if either of you want me.
Tell me straight, Lieutenant.
Ever seen anything like that before?
Never.
Let's hit this tape.
I want to hear it again.
W- What do we do now,
Pete?
Well, if there's any dirty work to be done,
Arno wouldn't be involved.
Come on.
Let's follow his stooge.
I hope you're right.
Man: Licorice Skull.
$50 on Licorice Skull in the 5th.
And John Aloicious in the 6th, $50.
Miss Press.
Yeah, that's right.
Miss Press in the 7 th,
In the 8th, Forever Anger.
Yeah, that's it.
Thanks.
Angie, uh, a word, if you please.
Sure. Get your mind on Sataquoi Downs.
Hey, how'd you ever get the kid to pick the horses?
It's easy.
If he don't pick the winners, he don't eat.
Hey, hey.
That's good thinking.
Good thinking.
But it don't make no difference.
I just got the word... we get rid of him.
Oh, gee.
I was just gettin' a good streak goin'.
The boss says he cannot live, not with that memory of his.
Yeah. Well, I figured it'd come to that.
That's too bad, but we gotta figure out now how to get rid of the body so nobody but nobody finds it.
That's understandable.
Hey, how 'bout Navajo Lake?
It's about 240 feet deep in the center.
We weight the kid down, throw him in.
He goes down and down and down.
Nobody'd ever find him.
Nothin' the matter with that.
I like it.
Maybe we could get some fishing in afterwards, huh?
The season don't open for a couple weeks yet.
Well, gamble.
We'll take a chance.
Well, whatever.
Good.
Then it's all settled.
First thing in the morning, kid takes a dip in the lake, huh?
Beautiful. But let me get a couple more winners.
Yeah, sure, calling the police would be the easy way.
What about Dexter?
He ends up in jail with the rest of 'em.
Yeah, but how are we gonna get Dexter out of the house without the help of the police?
We gotta realize that this could be dangerous.
Okay. So it's dangerous.
We owe it to Dexter.
And what's a couple of bullets in the old gut anyway?
Yeah.
You aren't going.
You guys and Schuyler gotta stick around here for the "College Knowledge" program tomorrow.
Us?!
Without Dexter?
Ohh. I've rather have a couple of bullets in the old gut.
Listen, what if we get hung up and we don't get back in time?
You guys gotta represent the school.
Annie:
What's your idea, Pete?
Okay. We gotta have the run of the place without anybody catching on.
Somebody's coming!
Hey, where's the paint for the trim?
Chillie, there's a whole bunch of painters outside.
- Painters?
- Yeah.
Get him upstairs.
- Upstairs, kid.
- I hate painters.
- See? They're swarmin' all over the place.
- Good morning.
- What are you people doing out here? What is this?
- We're painting the house.
- I can see that! What am I, blind?! But why?!
Well, this is the Hancock house, isn't it?
- 22 Forest View Road?
- Yeah. Yeah, this is it.
Boy, you had me worried there for a second.
Terrible thing if we were painting the wrong house.
What is this?
That's an order.
No, it's all correct.
An order to paint the house.
- An order, huh?
- Yeah.
Well, look, look, w-why don't you people go away and come back tomorrow, huh?
We can't do that.
We gotta do it today.
Man, it says so right here.
Give me this! Angie, nobody moves here, nobody.
Whatever.
Just hold up the work here!
Hold it, kid!
Hol... hold it!
One second.
Good morning.
Medfield Paint Company.
We cover the county.
Oh, they got there.
Fine. Fine.
You mean they really are painters?
They look like a bunch of punks to me.
Well, sir, they're part of our youth program.
Don't worry, you'll find they do excellent work.
I guess it's okay.
They check out.
This could be murder!
Not if we don't panic.
Just keep on painting the house like we know what we're doing, and keep your eyes on those windows and be ready, okay?
You have any luck up there?
Nothing yet.
That's where I thought they'd be keeping him.
Yeah, well, some of the shades are drawn.
He could be in one of those rooms without us knowing it.
Yeah.
We'll watch real close.
Hey! Look out!
Beautiful.
Really beautiful.
Oh, come on, you guys!
Be careful, will ya?
You know, we've been here almost an hour and nobody's seen anything of him.
Do you think he's up there, Pete?
Yeah, he's in there.
I'll guarantee it.
He's in there somewhere, man.
Just keep your eyes peeled, okay?
The big guy's gone through a couple times, but so far, no Dexter.
Bradley!
Bradley, what...
Oh, Bradley!
You mean I was supposed to paint the house orange and the trim green?
That's exactly what I mean to tell you, Bradley!
Gosh, Pete, I don't know how I could make a mistake like that.
Annie: Pete!
Pete, those guys!
I just heard them talking, and they're going to do something to Dexter, I know it!
All right.
What'd they say, Annie?
Well, they said to get him ready, and the longer they wait, the more chance they have of getting caught.
A- And then a couple of them went upstairs.
Okay.
We gotta make our move.
Come on, let's go.
I don't understand why you don't understand.
The police understood perfectly.
Ohh. Oh, Quigley, thank heavens you're here.
- Did you find Dexter?
- No luck. I'm sorry.
What... do you realize we might be stuck with these things?
Oh, now, really, Dean, we don't like this any more than you do.
Oh, shut up.
I'm talking to him.
Don't we at least have an alternate for Dexter?
Well, yes.
We, uh, we have Peter Ocho.
Oh, thank heavens.
At least he's intelligent.
Only, uh, he's not there, either.
Where is he? Where?
Well, uh, as near as I can find out, he's off painting a house somewhere.
- Painting a house?!
- Good morning, Eugene.
I see we're all here early.
Well, it's the early bird that catches the worm.
Don't you worm me, you worm!
Eugene.
Now, what have you done with that boy?!
You've done something with him!
I'm gonna see you in jail for this!
Dean Higgins, perhaps we'd better go sit down.
I don't want to sit down.
Eugene, you mustn't get yourself so excited.
After all, you have your health to think about.
So you don't win the contest.
It's only money.
A car!
Oh, hi, boss.
What's with all those kids out there?
- Oh, you mean the painters?
- Painters?!
This place looks like a Halloween joke!
Oh, no.
I called their shop, boss.
They're painters.
I tell ya, they're okay.
They'd better be.
They are. You'll see.
I checked.
Sherwood Forest.
Robin Hood speaking.
This 247-8824?
Congratulations.
You win the prize.
How would you like your sheep dog wrapped?
So, they're okay?
You checked 'em out, did ya?
They're not painters, you numskull!
They're a bunch of his school buddies!
- School buddies! I knew it! I knew it all the time!
- Yeah, I'll bet!
How are you gonna get him outta here?
Oh, boss, I am way ahead of you on that.
The boys are upstairs getting him ready right now.
Oh, you pea brain.
Did you find him?
No. Didn't you guys?
- No.
- No.
I looked everywhere, even in the closets.
Arno's guys... what are they doing?
Well, they're back there packing a trunk.
They must be getting ready to leave or something.
I mean, they... they wouldn't leave without taking Dexter along with them.
What kind of a trunk was it,
Bradley?
Um, about that long, and about that high.
You know, a regular trunk.
It was Dexter.
They're packing Dexter!
- Man: Man, this kid's heavy!
- They're comin'!
Take it easy goin' around the corner.
How come I always get the heavy end?
Quit complainin', will ya?
Oh!
Ugh!
Here, here, here!
Well, break it down!
Yeah, yeah.
The door!
Grab it! Grab it!
Dexter?
Dexter!
Come on!
Let's get outta here!
Aw, you're probably outta gas, you idiot!
What's goin' on here?
They put paint in everything.
Well, what do we do now?
- The kid's car!
- Well, come on! Let's go!
Come on! Let's go! Let's go!
This is the only truck I've ever been in that didn't have any tools in it.
Dexter, are you all right?
Hey, it's hot!
Get me outta here!
He...
He needs ventilation!
Dexter's car!
I forgot all about it!
Give it all you got!
I can't!
I've got it floored now!
What are we going to do?
Hey, what's going on?!
Hey, get me outta here!
Come on, help me with this paint.
Not them!
Their tires.
Get closer.
Oh, no!
Here he comes again, Pete!
- What are we going to do?
- Let's get the other one! Get the other one!
Look out! They're gonna dump some more paint!
No problem.
- Come on! - Come on!
- Come on, baby! Fall!
Get me in, you dummies!
Get me in!
Fall!
What are you tryin' to do, kill me?!
Now what, Pete?
Start dumping everything.
Throw everything!
Duck!
Whoo-hoo!
Aw, you blithering idiot!
Aw, shut up!
- We will now direct our fourth historical question to Medfield College.
The word "paleolithic" is used to describe a stage of human culture lasting probably over a million years and ending about 8,000 B.C.
Now, for 10 points each, please describe and date the following cultures... the mesolithic culture, the neolithic culture, and the chalcolithic culture.
Do you know what he's talking about?
No. Do you know what he's talking about?
Unh-unh.
Gentlemen, you have about
15 seconds.
He could give me
15 months.
Medfield, your time is about up.
I will need an answer.
We pass on that one, your honor.
"Your honor"?
We have the reports about that stuff on the tape.
Yeah?
That kid really had something.
Riverdale and Scottsfield card room... and Emmitt Junction, a horse parlor behind a barbershop.
And the guy in Emmitt Junction mentioned a Mr. A.J. Arno.
Well.
That's the end of an era.
Let's pick him up.
Bradley, go tell Dean Higgins we've got Dexter here.
Right!
Annie: Dexter, are you all right?!
Oh, I don't know.
Pete:
What's the matter?
It's my head.
There's this ringing in my head.
Come on, let's get him outta this box. Maybe he'll feel better.
Now, take it easy with him!
Hey, Dexter, straighten out your legs.
I can't!
And they were bringing him down the hall, and then we fought with them, and we took him in the room and put him on the windowsill.
- Put who on the windowsill?
- I think it's "whom," sir.
Oh, is it?
I don't care about that!
What about... go on with the story!
And then the trunk fell out of a second-story window.
On top of him?
No, he was in it.
- Hi, Dean Higgins.
- Hi, Dean.
What happened to him?
Pete: Ah, it's a long story,
Dean Higgins.
It was really a terrible experience.
Bradley,
I'm not asking you.
Look, Dean Higgins, Dexter's been through quite a bit, but that really doesn't matter now.
The main thing is that we got him back.
So you don't have to worry about him.
He's gonna be all right...
I think.
And so we arrive at the halfway portion of our show with the score Springfield, 115,
Medfield, 20.
Hey, that's Dexter.
It looks like the missing panelist from Medfield has finally shown up.
- There, ladies and gentlemen, we'll see now whether the old adage
"better late than never" can hold up.
Medfield has quite a bit of ground to make up, and, uh, we'll see whether the man with the computer like mind can, uh, can pull it off.
It should be an exciting second half.
And we will begin, peculiarly enough, by asking this 20-pointer of Medfield.
He's here.
Would you please give us the common name of the following species of birds... the Lagopus Scoticus, the Amazona Farinosa, and the Pica Pica?
The Lagopus Scoticus is the red grouse, the Amazona Farinosa is the mag... parrot, and the Pica Pica is the magpie.
That is absolutely correct!
20 points for Medfield.
I tell you, Quigley, it's in the bag.
For 10 points each, could you tell us the capitals of these countries...
Pakistan, Mongolia, and Jordan?
The capital of Pakistan is... Rawalpindi,
Mongolia...
Ulaanbaatar...
Jordan is A-A...
A...
Amman.
That's absolutely correct for 30 points.
Quigley, what's the matter with him?
I think he's falling apart.
Now, Springfield State, please give us the victorious army and generals in the following
Revolutionary-War battles... the first battle of
Freeman Farm,
Bennington, and the Battle of Quebec.
Bennington.
Freeman Farm was under Stark,
Bennington under Cornwallis,
- and Quebec under Carleton.
- Sorry.
The information is correct, but the correlation is incorrect.
Medfield... Freeman Farm,
Bennington, and the Battle of Quebec.
Freeman Farm...
The... The English... un-der Corn-wallis.
Benning-ton...
Bennington...
The Ameri-cans... un-der...
S...
S- Stark.
Quebec, Dexter.
What about Quebec?
The... En-glish... un-der...
C- C-Carle-ton.
That's... correct.
We're getting there, but I don't know how much more of this I can stand.
Would you, Springfield State, give us, in the proper order, the six largest bodies of water in the world?
The, uh, Pacific, Atlantic,
Indian, Arctic,
Mediterranean, and Caribbean.
Sorry, again.
The order is not quite correct.
Medfield, you now have an opportunity to go ahead.
The Pacific,
At-Ian-t-tic...
In-di-an...
A- ar-ctic...
Car-i-bbe-an... and Med-i- ttt-ttt- ttt-tt-
...terranean.
That is absolutely correct.
20 more points for Medfield.
And with two minutes left,
Medfield now has a 15-point advantage.
Maybe we can make it now.
We live in hope.
Now, a 10-pointer for Springfield State.
In the Congress of the United States, there are 435 representatives.
Please tell us how many representatives come from states west of the Mississippi.
Out of 435 representatives,
148 come from states west of the Mississippi.
That is correct for 10 points, and Medfield's lead is now cut to 5 points!
Medfield...
New York City was the first capital of the United States.
For 10 points, can you name the second capital of the United States and what year it was moved to Washington?
Ph...
Come on, Dexter.
Hang on for another minute.
Ph...
Phil-a-dee- el-phi-a... m- m-moved... i- i-i-i-in... eight-t-t-t-t-teen...
Eight-teeee-yump.
"Yump"?
Oh, he's gone, Quigley.
He's completely gone.
Springfield...
For 10 points and the lead, can you answer the question?
The national capital moved from Philadelphia to
Washington, D.C., in 1800.
That is absolutely correct!
We have time now for one last question... a 10-pointer for Medfield.
And this will determine the winner.
A small, midwest city is located exactly on an area designated as the geographic center of the United States.
For 10 points and $ 100,000, can you tell us the name of that city?
Come on, Dexter. Think.
I can't.
I've had it!
I'm just like
I used to be!
But you know this one.
We talked about it before.
Remember? It's that place where my uncle owns the dry-cleaning store.
I've told you about it a thousand times.
You know, they have those signs at the edge of town that...
I know.
For the first time in 15 weeks,
I know an answer.
I know!
He knows?
I know!
Yes, well, s-sit down a- and g-give us an answer.
I know. I know, I know,
I know, I know!
You have three seconds left.
Lebanon...
Lebanon, Kansas.
That is absolutely correct, and Medfield wins the $ 100,000 prize!
We've gotta get outta here.
Not here, stupid!
Come on!
- Yes!
- Now, take it easy!
You almost killed me before!
Don't worry, boss.
Don't worry.
Do you hear a siren?
What siren?
Why, you stupid...
Don't worry about it, gentlemen.
We got insurance.
But, Dean Higgins, it's new equipment like this electroheliospectrograph that's going to put Medfield on the map.
Oh, really, Quigley... an electroheliospectrogram?
Graph, sir.
Well, graph. Whatever.
Everybody knows that I am all for progress, but there are limits.
You wanted a computer, we got you a computer.
Now, I'll admit, I was a little bit reluctant at first, but we've got to remember, we can't do everything that a state school can do.
Now, there's Collingsgood, sitting over there in the lap of luxury with all that tax money, building, building, building.
It's disgusting... all that building!
I tell you, the trials and tribulations of administration weigh heavily on one today.
It's not easy to be a dean in a private school today.
It's tough, tough, tough.
There they are again.
Every time we meet, they meet.
Maybe I can find out from the gardener what's going on.
Oh, uh, strike that,
Winifred.
No, I'm...
I'm sorry, Quigley.
The helioelectrospectrograph is out.
Electroheliospectrograph.
Well, whatever it is, it's out.
- It's, uh... gram?
- Graph.
Graph. Out.
Gentlemen,
I've made a decision on what we're going to do with our award money.
As you know, the building and loan associations are paying an excellent rate of interest.
Now, if we were to put our funds in one of these institutions, at the end of, say, uh, five years, the equivalent of interest would obviously be considerable.
And at that time I think it would behoove us to look into the long-neglected plumbing situation.
- Plumbing?!
- Plumbing, are you kidding?!
How do you like that?!
We kill ourselves on that program, and Higgins wants to spend the dough on plumbing.
Poor Quig. You know, we ought to figure a way to get him one of those things.
Yeah, that's for sure.
See you later.
Oh, yeah.
See you later.
Hey, Dexter, what's an electroheliospectrogram?
Heck, I don't know.
I don't know either, but if we ever get one, don't fool around with it, okay?
Okay.
5@y3
I've lived all my life on the sea.
So did my father.
So will my son.
I've seen the giant creatures of the deep, the great whales, making their passage to northern feeding grounds.
And the last herds of the sea elephant.
I've watched the cunning maneuvers of killer whale..
As they leaped into the air...
And hit the sea with the sound of a Cannon shot, frightening the sea elephants and sea lions into the water, where they would become easy prey.
The shark, lacking this cleverness, prowled for what smaller fish he could find.
The giant octopus, fearsome-looking but timid, has many a time avoided my boat.
But the dolphins, the dolphins always seemed to come right up to the Fisherman's boat and ride the bow wave with the speed of a torpedo.
Curiously, they seemed at times to be talking to each other and to be looking at us.
I used to watch them for hours, studying them, thinking and remembering the stories
I'd heard about them.
But I didn't really know the dolphins until my son, a child, as in the Bible, led me to an understanding of their kind.
It was a few years ago when the red plague destroyed almost all edible fish in the Florida keys.
Like the fishermen above, the surviving creatures below were hungry.
Even the swift dolphin was able to find no food.
The fish were poisoned by the plague.
Their lifeless bodies were spread throughout the sea.
Pa, maybe this time the fish will be alive.
Maybe the red tide didn't come out this far.
Maybe. But soon we're gonna find fish if we have to go 20 miles out and clear to the bottom.
They're dead.
Well, let's get rid of them.
It used to be you'd throw out an anchor, you'd hit a fish.
Pa, look!
Dolphins.
They're sure making time.
They're probably looking for fish the same as we are.
It shouldn't be as hard for them.
What's the matter, pa?
Is something wrong, pa?
Hazel must have changed her course.
The weather station this morning said she was headed west, but she's coming north now.
Amplifier's gone.
I should have carried a spare tube.
You're not scared, are you?
No, pa.
Well, lash down everything loose.
We'll gonna make a run for home.
Message block, son.
Good boy.
Read it.
"Return to port.
"Coast guard patrol boat will intercept you.
"Hurricane Hazel now heading north.
Winds increasing up to 80 knots."
But you knew that already.
I should have known it an hour ago. Hold fast.
You Porter Ricks out of coral key?
That's right.
We've been trying to raise you.
Radio's out.
You heard from Nick Velakis, another boat like mine?
Just had him on the radio.
He says he can make it in all right ahead of the storm.
I can't take you in tow.
Do you want to come aboard?
Risk my boat?
No, thank you.
We'll make it.
Pa, are we gonna make it?
I promised your ma we'd be home before dark.
Come on, Zack, hurry up.
It's terrible outside the channel.
I haven't seen your folks go by yet.
You better go and get 'em.
Mr. L.C. Porett, you old fool, stop nagging that boat and get get on up there to the post office.
And leave mirabel?
I'd rather leave my wife!
There's Porter.
Porter Ricks' boat.
Come on, Porter!
Come on, mirabel!
Porter, where the halifax you been?
Nick Velakis come in yet?
Ain't seen him.
Come on!
Everybody's heading for the post office.
Sandy, if your mother's not already at the post office, you get home and help her, you hear?
Ok, pa.
Give me that line.
Where the blazes you goin' now?
I'm gonna put that boat up at Willow creek.
She'll be safe there.
But you ain't got time.
Give me that line!
This boat's my living!
Kim.
Gee, I'm sorry.
Where you been?
The whole town's been worried about you and your father.
Is my mother inside the post office?
No. I was just going to see if... you go back inside.
I'll get her.
Gee, you're lucky.
A hurricane on your first visit.
Son!
Ma!
Where's your pa?
He's taking the boat up Willow creek.
Ma, what about Pete?
Can I take him?
Everyone's allowed one luxury.
Go get him.
Pete!
Pete, where are you?
Pete!
Pete!
Pete, come down here.
We got to get to the post office.
Pete, I'll whale the tar out of you unless you come down here!
Pete, come down here.
We got to get to the post office.
Is your ma all right?
Ma's ready to go.
Get Pete and come.
Come on down here, Pete.
Porter.
You didn't worry?
I did.
Will it be here when we get back?
The boat's safe.
I can always build another house.
Dang blast it, you stubborn old bird!
Come on, Sandy.
Pete won't come.
We can't wait.
He'll be killed.
Pelicans have lived through more hurricanes than we'll ever see.
Come on.
May I bring my boat in, miss hettie?
No, sir,
Mr. L.C. Porett.
You can come in, but you can't bring the boat.
I can't leave mirabel out here.
She'll blow away.
"Parcels in any post office of the United States
"shall not exceed
100 inches in length and girth combined."
Section 135.32, postal laws and regulations.
I don't want to mail mirabel anywhere.
The same applies to holding and storage.
Are you coming in?
Not without my mirabel
I ain't.
I'm pretty sure we got ahold of everybody that didn't go inland, except Nick Velakis.
His boat's still out.
Well, if the phone goes out, we've still got the radio.
Well, we're fairly comfortable here.
If the water level don't rise,
I think we'll make it all right.
Nick must have run with the wind, put in at one of the other keys.
He would have called me.
The phone lines might be down.
When he's safe,
I feel it.
Stella, he has to be all right.
Nobody knows the sea like Nick.
The sea...
It kills even those who know it.
I'm not worried about myself.
I just hope my father and cousin aren't trying to come out from the mainland.
State police don't let anybody on the causeway once the hurricane warning goes up.
Well, I bet he's sure worried about me.
What? With you staying with hettie?
You know what she says.
Uh-uh.
No hurricane would dare blow down the U.S. post office.
Miss hettie?
Miss hettie?
Miss hettie?
It's still no,
Mr. L.C. Porett.
Don't make no difference, miss hettie.
Mirabel just blew away.
Oh, Mr. Porett, come in.
Oh, Mr. L.C. Porett, you poor, dear man!
Post office.
Who's calling?
Who? Parker?
Oh. He wants you.
Miss hettie white speaking.
Yes, Mr. Parker.
I'm looking at her this very moment, safe, high and dry.
Aren't you, Kim?
Now, don't you worry,
Mr. Parker.
As soon as Hazel leaves, you come right on out.
Of course, we'll take good care... hello. Hello?
Hello!
Well, line's down.
That means the water's over the causeway.
Yeah. We could have water in here like in '58.
Radio: Winds to 120, gusts to 160.
Barometer is still falling.
Waterspouts reported in the area.
Full Gale warnings have been posted.
Pa, what about Pete?
It's my fish house!
It's on fire!
My fish house is on fire!
Mr. Abrams!
If it's not there, what do we do?
Build it again.
That's right, son.
Let's find out.
It's still there!
Pete?
Pete?
Isn't it beautiful?
You sure are.
Thanks for not crying.
Pa, we should've taken him with us.
Pa, we should've.
You haven't even looked for him.
Maybe he's under the house.
Let's go see.
Ohh!
Well, let's take a look.
Old hurricane Pete.
You get him untangled, son, he'll be all right.
Maybe we'd better look inside.
Pete, you old...
You gave me all that trouble last night you're going to, you old...
Sandy, your house is ok!
I thought I'd come and see.
Yeah, but this bird isn't.
Hey, it's Pete!
Yeah. And just as big a pest as ever.
Hi, Mr. Ricks.
Hi, Kim.
Well, it's kind of damp inside, but it's not too bad.
You going to see the boat?
Right now. Do you want to come along?
Yeah.
Sure!
Come on.
Pa, she's wrecked.
No, not wrecked, just swamped, but there might be some damage.
Here, son.
You bail out the dinghy while I take a look here.
A shark!
Where?
Over there!
It's a dolphin.
You hurt or scared?
Just scared,
I guess.
Good. You better start bailing.
Mr. L.C. Porett's gonna have to help me get the boat out.
Drive shaft's broken.
Lay to, northern star.
Lay to, baby.
Anytime your Jack is ready, Mr. L.C. Porett!
Aye, aye, Porter.
1/3 ahead, northern star.
1/3 ahead.
Easy as you go.
Gee, it's so pretty up here.
Look!
There he is again!
Pa?
Ever see anything like that before?
Dolphins do like that every now and then.
Little right rudder, northern star.
Do they really,
Mr. Ricks?
Well, there are lots of stories about dolphins.
One old one that Nick Velakis... that Nick tells about a Greek poet named arion, who lived some 3,000 years ago.
Once when he was sailing home to Greece from sicily, robbers took his money and threw him overboard.
Well, a dolphin who was following the ship swam for him, lifted him up, and carried him safely to shore.
You believe that, pa?
Well, I believe dolphins are very special animals.
Animals?
Sure. A dolphin isn't a fish.
They breathe air and have eyelids and have babies, just like people.
You mean the dolphin jumped right out of the dinghy?
Like a bucking bronco.
And like a dope,
I was yelling,
"shark! Shark!"
Oh, hello, sid.
Would you like a cup of... what is it?
Porter, I thought you ought to know.
He was your friend.
Nick Velakis.
We found his boat, but not his body, and we searched all day.
"He is not dead.
"He doth not sleep.
"He hath awakened from the dream of life.
He has outsoared the shadow of our night."
Unto almighty god, we commend the soul of Nick Velakis, who might not have been of our faith, but was in spirit a brother to us all.
We commit his body to the deep.
Amen.
Nick Velakis was killed by the sea, but he wasn't defeated by it.
His life and his living came from it.
When the red tide came and took the fish away, he kept looking for new places to find them, as food for all of us.
Nick, I'll keep searching.
In there, young man.
Put it in there.
Oh, Porter, knew I'd catch you on the way back.
Sorry I couldn't attend, but the living come first.
Lou germain sent you a wire from Ocala.
He...well, read it yourself.
It's really to you.
Thanks, hettie.
Come, now, a little bigger!
I wonder what's on Lou's mind.
Sandy!
My father's on his way with my cousin.
Is he bringing his new boat?
Uh-huh. We'll all go fishing.
Sandy: Ok.
Sandy, you've got a lot of chores and repair work at home.
Yes, sir.
See you later.
Fishing.
It's nice of Lou germain to offer to help.
Truth is,
I was going to ask him.
It's going to take a good
$300 worth of credit... a new drive shaft, engine parts, some new planking.
Po, have you thought again about doing what Lou did?
Go onto the mainland,
I mean.
Open a boat agency or some inland job we talked about?
At least there'd be no red plague or hurricanes.
Well, there might be other things.
I guess.
Well, if you're gonna truck the boat into Ocala tomorrow, let's go to bed.
Would you...Want to live on the mainland?
I just don't know anymore.
Leave those till morning, sweetheart.
Oh. I don't want to forget this.
Do you expect him to get all those chores done before you get back?
Well, he ought to.
I'll be gone at least a couple of weeks.
Dang you, Pete.
Don't you think this is heavy enough?
Beat it.
Mom?
Mom, could
I please... oh, thanks, ma.
Tired?
Dragging tired.
I think you've done enough for one day.
It's Kim and her father.
They've come for me.
Ma, can I go?
Of course.
Hi, Sandy!
Hi, Kim.
Dad, this is
Sandy Ricks.
Coming with us?
Oh, yes, sir.
With the red plague and the hurricanes, is there any fish out there?
Oh, yes, sir, if you know the spots.
Well, you're the pilot.
Cast off the lines.
The plague hasn't left very many fish, but sometimes there's one or two.
Sandy, you remember,
I told you my cousin was coming with dad?
Bill Jamison,
Sandy Ricks.
Aah!
Come on, Sandy.
Be careful.
Hey, let's go find Bill.
He's hurt.
What was it?
A dolphin.
Go get your pa.
Over there a little bit.
Sandy!
Doc barnett will know what to do.
He's taken care of just about everybody.
It's a slight concussion, but he's going to be all right.
Sandy, I can't thank you enough.
If Bill's ok, could we go back to Silver Cove now?
Silver cove?
What for?
That dolphin, sir.
It has a spear in its side.
What could we do for it?
My pa taught me to put a dog or a cat or any animal out of its pain, especially a dolphin, because they beach themselves before they die, and...
But, Sandy, I've got to call Bill's mother and tell her what happened.
She may want me to take bill in to to see the family doctor. I can't... it won't take long, dad!
Please, sir?
Dad...
Kim, it's not that
I don't want to.
But bill's mother would never forgive me.
Please...
Sandy!
Ma!
Ma!
Ma!
Hey, go ahead.
You're free.
I cut you loose.
Swim!
Are you hurt that bad?
Please move.
Just a flipper or something?
I can't leave you here to die.
Can't you move at all?
Sandy?
Hi.
Where'd you go?
Nowhere.
What'd you do?
Nothing.
Supper will be ready in a minute.
Didn't you go out with Kim and her father?
Oh, sure, mom.
Well, that's nice.
Mom?
Yes?
Mom...
Sandy, you been up to something?
Oh, no, ma, only...
Sandy, what?
I've got an 8-foot dying dolphin in the fish pen.
An 8-foot dolphin?
You know how long that cabinet is?
About 8 feet.
Now, you go wash up for supper.
Sandy.
I think I'll have a look.
Sandy!
That's what
I told you, ma.
He got speared.
Oh, that poor thing.
What'll we do, ma?
Same thing I'd do for any animal.
Get me the kitchen knife and the iodine.
And then?
Then I just towed him home.
"Where'd you go?
What'd you do?"
Nowhere, nothing, huh?
I think it'll be supper and a good night's rest for you.
Sandy!
That water's freezing!
You want to catch your death of cold?
Back to bed.
Yes, ma'am.
I just wanted to see how flipper was doing.
Flipper?
Yes, flipper.
I named him flipper.
Don't you think that's a good name, ma?
I think you should go back to bed. Go on, now.
Ok.
Poor flipper.
My cousin says he's awful sorry.
Daddy took him home this morning.
Ma, is he gonna die?
It's a very bad wound.
But you fixed it.
He needs strength to recover.
He needs food.
In the ocean, he'd have a chance... in the ocean?
Ma, the first shark that saw him would kill him.
He's so weak!
He'll die here, too, without food.
Couldn't we...
Somehow...
Can't I...
Your pa told you how much fish a dolphin eats.
About 15 pounds a day.
With the red plague, where would you find it?
Some days up at silver cove, there's a lot.
Not every day.
But he'll be well in a few days, and... and then we could...
Please, ma?
Please?
Well, you try it, but just today.
Come on, Kim!
Sandy, don't go down anymore.
You'll make yourself sick.
But only
2 little fish?
Please?
There just aren't any more.
I guess you're right.
I guess he doesn't like those kind of fish.
What are we going to do?
I don't know.
You don't feel you owe me nothing for a whole day's fishing?
You owe us a day's fishing.
50 miles out and 50 back.
Our deal was for marlin, and all we get is a bunch of trash fish.
Don't expect to see us back again, either.
Mr. Lake, sir, could I have some of the fish?
Take 'em.
Take them all.
But to get them, you're gonna have to clean my boat.
Clean it of the smell of fish, every board and seam.
From now on, this is gonna be a coral reef sightseeing boat.
The devil with fish!
Yes, sir.
Yaah!
Ma!
Ma!
Ma!
Hey, ma!
Sandy, come out!
Sandy, don't do that!
Sandy, come out!
Don't do that!
Please, Sandy!
What's the matter, ma?
I think we better go in the house and talk this over.
Still, even if, uh, uh...
Flipper.
Even if flipper is as gentle as a dog, how will you feed him?
There aren't any fish, not even at silver cove.
Mr. Abrams is bringing in fish from the other keys to sell here.
Mr. Abrams is not going to feed your dolphin.
I'll do chores for him.
He needs help to rebuild his fish house.
What about your own chores?
I'll do them both.
Mine, too.
Please, ma, let me try.
Well...you can try for a while, but you'd better get at that fence first thing in the morning.
Ok, mom.
Hungry again, huh?
All right, it's a deal.
You're hired.
$1.00 an hour.
In fish?
In fish.
Start nailing up the boards.
Hi, Rick.
Hi.
Hi.
Hi, Roy.
Hey, Kim Parker says you got a porpoise at your place that does tricks.
Dolphin.
You're a bigger liar than she is.
I've been out to your place a couple of times.
It don't do no tricks.
I can prove
I'm not a liar.
How?
Tomorrow afternoon.
Bring your friends, all of them.
Ok.
But everybody's got to bring a ticket.
Ticket?
One fish.
Each kid has got to bring a fish.
Ok.
Hi, Charlie.
Watch him get it.
Take a seat right over there.

Po figures to be in about midnight.
Thank you, Baxter.
It seemed like
10 weeks.
It sure did.
That's why I didn't stop to put the boat in the water.
What is it, po?
Well, maybe it's not right keeping you out here, but, Martha,
10 days in Ocala decided me all over again.
I couldn't trade this for jammed sidewalks, auto smoke, all that hurry.
Unless you said you wanted to.
I don't want to.
None of the work's been done.
Martha?
Well, po, the day after you left, it so happened that a dolphin...
This'll take a while.
We better go inside.
Pa, watch this!
Come on out, son.
I want to talk to you.
Pretty good, huh, pa?
I've never known anybody who's seen anything like it.
It's like the old stories
Nick used to tell about.
But your mother tells me you expect to keep the dolphin.
You'll figure some way, won't you, pa?
Where? The boat's ready.
I'll need the pen.
Couldn't we dig another, maybe?
It took a month and $500 to blast that one out of the coral.
Sandy, the dolphin's well again.
Let him go free.
Pa, he's come to be my friend.
I'd lose him.
I couldn't do that.
He's a friend who's kept you from your work.
Not one thing finished in the 10 days I was gone.
I'll do my work, honest.
How will you feed him?
Doing chores for Mr. Abrams.
What about your own chores?
I'll do them, too.
Son, you've tried that before.
It just didn't work out.
I couldn't let him go, pa.
I've gotten to love him.
Do you remember
Stella Velakis at the funeral?
Didn't she love her husband?
Sandy, for you this may be the first time.
I know it hurts.
Open the fish gate.
I can't, pa.
I can't.
Pa, please don't.
Flipper, don't go.
Flipper, come back.
I sure hope we find flipper.
I never prayed so hard in my life as I did this morning.
Flipper!
Flipper!
Nothing again?
Nothing.
Have you thought about what I said the other day?
About losing things and the people you love?
Uh-huh, like flipper and Nick Velakis.
Like everybody.
Everybody?
Not you and mom.
In time, everybody, son.
But that's not to think about now.
What we've got to make up our minds to is to find fish, look ahead to better days, new friends, and for you...
School, come September.
How come the hurricane hit everything but the schoolhouse?
Flipper!
Boy, am I ever glad to see you!
You say something?
Uh, no, sir.
Stay down. Pa doesn't think you're a good influence.
Sandy!
You'll fall overboard!
Hey, where are you going?
Flipper, where are you going?
You want us to follow you?
You see something?
I thought I saw some fish jumping, towards shore.
Well, that's Green Point.
I don't see anything.
I thought I did.
Well, hang on.
Sandy, come here!
Pa, look!
Healthy, live pompano.
What made you try off green point?
Well, Sandy saw them jumping.
Well, I didn't exactly see them...
Tomorrow I'll be back there at first light, and, Martha, tomorrow I'm bringing back a boatload.
Son, by the way, when I'm gone, will you fix that wire?
Ok.
Flipper!
Where have you been?
Sure missed you!
You didn't have to stay away that long.
Flipper, come here!
Flipper, come up here!
Flipper, don't do that!
Hey, where are you?
Flipper, no!
Flipper, no!
You ate all of pa's pompano!
That's pa coming now.
All of them.
Every last one.
That dolphin got every last one of them.
Pompano's selling in ocala for better than $1.00 a pound, and you let a dolphin into the fish pen.
What have you got to say for yourself?
Pa, the fish you caught today, couldn't I help you get them into the pen?
There were no fish at green point.
Yesterday's catch was just an accident.
Yes, sir.
What's wrong with you, boy?
How old are you, 12?
Almost in your teens?
Or are you 9 or 7 or 5, a child who doesn't have the sense to know what his next meal depends on?
Answer me! The fence, the yard, the nets... not one of your chores done, and now this!
Are you growing up or down?
Aren't you getting any sense of responsibility, of obligation, discipline?
Or are you hanging on to a "feed me, dress me, blow my nose" childhood?
Answer me! Are you?!
I'm sure he would...
If he could.
Sandy, you better go to your room.
One more thing.
Tomorrow you'll go out by yourself.
And by yourself you'll find the fish to replace what that dolphin ate.
And you'll keep going out every day till you've replaced every pound of them.
Yes, sir.
Why?
Because it was the truth.
But you were too rough.
He's just a boy.
Well, he's got to grow up.
Nevertheless, he is a boy.
He's hurt. He's crying.
He still has to be told the truth.
The way you told him?
Shouting?
Nearly taking his head off?
Well, you should have stopped me.
I did.
Look, Martha,
I love that boy... then why don't you tell him?
Men just don't talk that way.
Maybe they should.
Maybe.
Look, sweetheart,
I grew up with the sea.
The sea is never soft.
And he is a Fisherman's son.
Flipper!
Flipper!
Where are you going?
Is it for me?
Can you get me another one?
Oh, flipper!
Near Kingman reef, huh?
There's never been fish there.
What made you try?
I...i just had a feeling.
Well, never mind why.
Let's go back and see.
Pa, will they be alive this time?
Only one way to find out, son.
Pa!
Well, this could mean life for Coral Key again.
We'll stop at the wharf and tell them, then we'll go home.
Only this time, I'll make sure the fish gate stays closed.
But flipper was the one... flipper can find his own fish.
Easy, folks. There's enough for everybody.
Here's a big fat one.
Hold out your sack there.
Sandy, you keep it going with Mr. Porett, will you?
Keep them coming, lad.
Well, what do you think?
Good as it ever was.
But for commercial, there has to be tonnage.
Is there tonnage?
There's never been any at Kingman reef before.
Well, there is now.
Maybe it has to do with the red tide, or it could be a new current from the channel.
Baxter, you and I could sample the whole area in one day.
I'll be at your place at 7:00 in the morning.
Good.
Mmm, smells good.
Ahh!
Lord, whose bounty sustains us, we ask thy favor.
Unite our hearts in family love.
Strengthen our will to serve thee in peace.
Thank thee, o lord, who bringest forth food from the sea for all. Amen.
Pa, when the lord brings forth food, he gets help sometimes, doesn't he?
Well, the lord helps those who help themselves.
I mean, the lord, for instance, would ask one man to help another?
Of course.
Well, sometimes wouldn't the lord ask dolphins to help people?
What's on your mind, Sandy?
It was flipper who led me to Kingman reef.
Flipper, huh?
Yes, pa.
Maybe you saw the same dolphin and maybe you didn't.
It doesn't matter.
Try to understand, son.
If the dolphins come, they tear our nets, they eat our fish, they chase the rest away.
Now, they may be your friends, but when the fish are scarce, they're a deadly enemy.
If they come, we'll kill them.
We have no choice.
Even flipper?
Even flipper.
Flipper!
Flipper!
Where are you?
We ought to be getting pretty close now.
Dolphins.
Hundreds of them.
If we kill a few, maybe the rest will run.
Look, po. There's one that got inside.
I'll get him.
Wait, Baxter.
Ease up.
Sandy!
And so after flipper killed the shark, he lifted me up and brought me back to you, just like you told us about Arion, the Greek poet?
You believe me, don't you, pa?
I saw it.
And, pa, there are lots of fish, millions and millions of them.
And it was flipper who led me to them.
Aren't there plenty for all of us?
I think it was written for us today to share with the dolphins, not to kill them.

My friends, this is Paris.
Gay, beautiful, wonderful, magnificent Paris.
Paris: The tender mother of romance.
Of love. Of amour.
But not all the love stories of France begin in Paris. No, no, no.
There was one, for example, a quite unusual one that began in the hot...
...sun-drenched region in the south of France...
...in the province known as Provence.
The time is around the turn of the century.
You call it the Gay Nineties, no?
But that is beside the point.
This is the story of a little female citizen of France...
...who is as beautiful and as innocent as her name.
And her name is Mewsette.
No last name. Just Mewsette.
Hello, Jaune Tom.
Hello, Mewsette.
That was a very nice song you were singing, Jaune Tom.
- Please sing some more for me.
- Mewsette...
...you know I can't sing it when you're looking at me.
Amour, amour...
...a- mush.
Jaune Tom! Jaune Tom!
Jaune Tom, you're wonderful.
Jaune Tom!
A moose! A moose!
I mean, a mouse.
It's as big as a moose.
- I mean, it's a whopper.
- A mouse?
Where? Where?
At the barn. Hurry! Hurry!
Come on, let's go!
Jaune Tom, you're a...
...clumsy country clod.
Bravo! Bravo!
Bravo!
Hey, Jaune Tom.
What are we going to do with our mouse?
We'll wrap it as a gift and give it to Mewsette.
Mewsette...
That's all I ever hear around this place.
But, my dear sister, how can you continue to bury yourself on this farm?
I like it here, Jeunesse, chérie.
I choose to live here.
And now, tell me about this friend of yours in Paris.
- Is he nice?
- My dear sister, what manners.
So polished.
Not at all like the plebeian peasants you would meet out here.
The peasants, they are good and honest...
...and very happy.
Happy, on this pile of dust?
How can you allow yourself to go to seed like a fat duck?
- Ducks don't go to seed, my dear sister.
- Well, like a vegetable then.
That's what you are, Marie:
A cabbage, an artichoke.
True, Jeunesse, and vegetables are happiest on farms.
But, darling, think of Paris.
Lovely, gay Paris.
Have you forgotten the sidewalk cafes and how we sipped champagne?
Champagne. That must be what they call catnip in Paris.
How nice.
The button champignons sauteed in butter with tiny shreds of ham.
Champignons.
I know what they are. Mushrooms!
And delicious too.
- And, my dear, the Champs Elysees.
- Champs Elysées?
- I wonder what they taste like.
- Oh, what a lovely feline.
Too bad her beauty is wasted here.
Now, in Paris, she would be perfumed and curled...
...and have a stunning coiffure.
We would go everywhere in style, wouldn't we, chérie?
The Rivoli, Maxim's, the Place Pigalle...
...boating on the Seine...
...with the music of Paris surrounding and caressing us.
Oh, those nights. So sparkling, so clear, that each star becomes...
...the glittering point of a great blue diamond.
Mewsette!
Hey, Mewsette!
What's the matter?
Are you deaf or something?
No. I am not deaf or something.
Come on, come on.
Read the poem.
Okay, okay.
You don't have to push.
A poem, dedicated to Mewsette.
To Mewsette, the prettiest cat
In all of France
All right, all right.
It's your poem.
Roses are red violets are blue
Here is a mouse from me to you
Signed, Jaune Tom.
Jaune Tom! You take that horrid, vulgar thing away from here this minute!
I've never been so insulted.
How dare you think that I would eat such a coarse, plebeian thing.
But...
- But cats like mice.
- Perhaps so.
- But I am not a cat, I'll have you know.
- You're not a...?
- You're not a cat?
- Not a cat?
I am a...
A... feline.
- A feline?
- You're a fe... What?
I think she means a female, Robespierre.
And all felines really like is champagne and champignons...
...and Champs Elysees...
And all I get on this farm is mice and milk!
I feel like a cabbage that's gone to seed. Like a fat duck!
Gosh, Mewsette, you're not as fat as a duck.
Oh, go away, you ple... Ple...
Plebeian peasant, you!
I never want to see you again.
I wish I were dead!
Oh, boo-hoo-hoo!
So do we.
Don't we, Jaune Tom?
Jaune Tom?
Jaune Tom?
Now look what you've done, you... You old feline, you!
Plebeians!
Well, if you don't like us "plebleens," why don't you go away with her?
I'll bet she just lives on "cham-pag-ne" and
"cham-pygmy-ons" and "champs-ulysses."
Why, Robespierre, that's a wonderful idea.
That's exactly what I'll do.
I'll go to Paris.
No more mice and milk for me!
Well, bon voyage, Mademoiselle Feline.
Au revoir, Robespierre!
Take good care of Jaune Tom!
What do you know?
She did it!
I must have a way with felines.
We're free! Free!
Free at last!
Well, you're a mouse.
You ought to know.
Why didn't she like you?
Did you ever have any trouble like that with your girl?
Oh. You are a girl.
Well, then tell me something from the girl's point of view.
What's wrong with me?
Jaune Tom! Jaune Tom!
- Where are you, Jaune Tom?
- Over here, Robespierre.
You can come on back now.
Everything's okay.
You mean Mewsette...?
Mewsette'll take the mouse?
No. She's left, Jaune Tom.
Took off.
- Nothing but fun now that Mewsette's gone.
- What do you mean she's gone?
- She just went away in a carriage.
- Carriage?
- What carriage?
- The one that took her to Paris.
- Well, why did she go to Paris?
- All felines go to Paris, I guess.
Come on, Jaune Tom.
Let's go mouse hunting.
Mewsette!
Hey. Wait for me!
Mewsette! Come back, Mewsette!
For the last time, my lad, if your friend arrived in that buggy...
...she has gone to Paris.
All right. I know that, but where's Paris?
What is Paris?
What is Paris?
- Are you mad?
- Is it a school or something for felines?
A school for felines?
- No? Well, a village, maybe?
- Yes.
That is what it is. A little village a mile or two up the tracks.
And now, if you don't mind,
I do have work to do.
Well, thanks a lot.
Jaune Tom! Jaune Tom!
- Pardon me, sir, but did you see...?
- He went thataway.
Gee, thanks. Jaune Tom!
Good morning, Jaune Tom.
Nighty-night.
I can hardly believe it!
I'm really on my way to Paris!
Delightful.
Delightful city, isn't it?
Oh, yes, sir.
Even more beautiful than
I dreamed it would be.
- First trip to Paris?
- Oh, yes.
- Visiting relatives?
- Oh, no.
I just up and decided that I'd vegetated too long on that dreary farm...
...and that every girl should see Paris and Jaune Tom is so dull...
...and I don't know anybody in Paris and it's all so wonderful...
Oh, but you must think I'm terribly bold to talk this way to a stranger.
Not at all. I think your enthusiasm is charming, and I'm not offended.
Oh, thank you.
I just know I'll be happy here.
Of course. But like any big city,
Paris has its pitfalls.
Oh, I realie that.
But after all, I'm...
I'm not exactly a kitten anymore.
I choose my friends very carefully.
And that's very wise, my dear.
Nevertheless, there are still a few unscrupulous characters about.
- Oh, dear me.
- You need a friend, a sponsor.
- Now, l...
- But that would hardly be proper, would it?
Mademoiselle! You cannot be inferring that I would suggest anything improper.
Oh, dear, no. Oh.
Please forgive me. It's just that...
I thought that my sister, one of the most influential cats in Paris...
...might be persuaded to take you under her wing.
Teach you all you need to know, introduce you to society.
But of course, if you would prefer to go it yourself...
...alone in a strange city, by all means.
- Oh, no, please.
- I would love to meet your sister.
- Then it is settled.
Come along, my dear.
Jaune Tom!
What are we doing down here,
Jaune Tom?
Let's go home before something happens to us.
I can't, Robespierre.
I have to find Mewsette.
Well, you look for Mewsette.
I'm gonna look for trains.
Is it much further to your sister's shop, monsieur?
No. It is just a little further along this street.
Yes. Here we are, my dear, the best in all Paris.
"Salon de Beaute Pour Felines.
Mme. Rubens-Chatte."
Meowrice, how nice to see you again.
- This is Mewsette, my dear sister.
- Isn't she pretty?
Any sister of Meowrice is a friend of mine.
Henrietta, you are my sister.
Sister!
Oh, yes. Yes, of course.
She is an old dear but a little absent-minded.
Imagine, not even remembering your own brother!
- Yes.
- How silly of me.
Of course I'm his sister.
I've been his sister for years.
Mewsette is new to Paris, dear sister.
I have told her of your wonderful salon...
...where you will make her into the belle of all Paris.
- Of course, dear brother.
- Then she is all yours, Henrietta.
- You know what must be done.
- Now, look here, Meowrice.
It's going to take time and money to make a lady out of this cat.
So this time, I want something in advance.
Don't rush things, my dear.
Just remember, time is on the side of the scoundrel.
- And you are the king of the scoundrels.
- Yes.
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have some business to attend to.
All right. Now listen carefully.
So I want one of you to keep an eye on that girl at all times.
Is that clear?
As they say,
"Evil is the root of all money."
Money trees, that is.
Big green money trees.
Gosh! We'll never find Paris in all those buildings and things.
- Yeah. There's a lot of them, all right.
- I told you it was a wild-goose chase.
- Come on. Let's go home.
- No, Robespierre.
- I can't go back without Mewsette.
- Well, I can.
So long, Jaune Tom.
I'm gonna miss you, Robespierre.
Take care of yourself.
Take care of myself?
Who's gonna take care of him?
Without me, no telling what'll happen to him.
Alone, friendless, far from home.
Well, don't just stand there.
Let's start looking.
Mewsette!
Mewsette!
Mewsette!
Mewsette!
- Quiet! Stop that noise!
- Go away, you silly little pussycats.
- Get away from here!
- Scram! Go on!
Leave those cats out of here!
Allez!
I don't know why she ever came to Paris.
I don't know why you ever came to Paris.
Your purr, my dear, it's like a cement mixer.
But that's the way I purred back home on the farm.
Well, it won't do here.
It must be refined, yet seductive.
Like this:
Now try again and put some throat into it.
Stop!
- Oh, stop!
- Oh, I'm sorry, Madame Rubens-Chatte.
Being sorry isn't enough.
Now, look, child.
We don't want to disappoint
Meowrice, do we?
- Oh, no. I'll try very hard this time.
- Good.
Now, let's show him how poised and gracefully...
...we walk with a bowl of milk on our head.
Now walk towards me.
Head erect.
Turn right. Left.
Reverse.
Oh, look out!
Oh, no.
I'm a failure. I'll never be a Parisian.
I'm going back home, back with the peasants...
...where I belong.
- No! No! Stop her! Stop her!
Stop her yourself.
My poor dear.
I know just how you feel.
Wouldn't you like to stroll on the boulevard, stop at a sidewalk cafe?
- And order Champs Elysees, just once.
- Of course, my pet.
Let us be gay.
We shall do the town.
- Do you feel better now, my dear?
- Oh, yes.
Those sidewalk cafes were so much fun.
And Paris is so beautiful!
And I feel so important riding in a buggy and...
Oh, good heavens, Meowrice.
What are they doing?
Oh, them? Why, they are kissing, chérie.
- What's kissing?
- Kissing?
Why, kissing is...
Like rubbing noses.
But do they only kiss in buggies?
Well, if you did away with buggies, you'd stop half the kissing in Paris.
How strange. Why is that?
Because, my naive one, there is nothing so romantic as a buggy ride.
- Here we are.
- Oh! So soon?
- Now, back to your lessons, my dear.
- Goodbye, Meowrice. And thank you!
How foolish I was.
I'll never think of that dull farm again.
I tell you, Jaune Tom, it's hopeless.
Absolutely hopeless.
- She's probably miles from here.
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I suppose you're right, Robespierre.
- Well, come on then.
- Let's go back to the farm.
- Okay. Okay.
Now you're talking!
Robespierre, look!
Look what it says: "Felines"!
That's what Mewsette said she was.
I'll bet they'd know where she is.
Here we go again.
Jaune Tom!
Help, Jaune Tom!
Jaune Tom! Help!
- Who is it, dearie?
- There's no one here.
No one at all.
Help!
You know, Robespierre, we're seeing parts of Paris that the tourists usually miss.
Let's find our way out of here and get back to that feline place.
"Mr. Henry Phtt, 1411 Sand Box Road...
...Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, U.S.A."
"Dear Mr. Phtt:
At long last, I have found a bride for you.
With proper schooling now underway...
...she will be the most beautiful and talented cat in the world.
I shall keep you informed of her progress.
Your obedient servant,
Meowrice Percy Beaucoup."
"P.S. I'm afraid that the price we agreed upon...
...must, under the circumstances, be doubled.
There are other suitors."
Well, I'm off to mail this letter.
If you ever decide to marry, boys, marry for love...
...of money.
Jaune Tom, you take that horrid, vulgar thing away from here this minute!
Pardon me, my friend, but that was the most remarkable exhibition...
...of "virtu-mouse-ity"
I've ever witnessed.
- Virtu-what-sity?
- Virtu-mouse-ity.
A little phrase I coined to describe the incredible proficiency...
...you just displayed in apprehending that rodent.
Obviously, it was too small.
Throwing it back was such a noble gesture.
It is an imposition, I know, but it would afford me great pleasure...
...if you would join me for a bite of dinner and perhaps a sip of...
We accept! We accept!
Name's Robespierre, manager of him...
...Jaune Tom, the world's greatest mouser.
And now can we eat?
It would seem to be out of our hands, monsieur.
What'll it be your pleasure you're having, s'il vous plait?
- Milk.
- Milk?
No, no. Let's really live it up big, Jaune Tom.
- Straight cream.
- No, no, messieurs.
On an occasion such as this, we drink champagne.
Champagne, garcon.
Champagne for the greatest mouse catcher in all France...
...and his manager.
One bottle of champagne, hot off the ice.
Hey, it's made out of bubbles.
I just wanna tell you...
...that you're all a wonderful bunch of gentlemen.
Everyone.
I saloosh...
Shaloot...
I salute you!
What a head.
What a head!
Here, what is this?
A turtle, perhaps?
A turtle with a hangover?
A two-headed turtle? Impossible.
Where are you going, turtle?
What do you know?
This is no turtle.
It's just a small, bloodshot kitten.
Oh, gently, gently, shipmate.
I won't harm your little friend.
You see, we three are all in the same boat.
The same boat.
That is pretty funny.
The same boat, no?
Say... No.
No, I guess not.
The truth is, we have been shanghaied, shipmates.
Or catnapped, in your case.
And that means we have to work.
Jaune Tom.
It's all right, Jaune Tom.
We'll get back all right.
Oh, it's such a big ocean, Robespierre, bigger than all France.
Bigger than the whole world.
Sure it is, but you've never given up hope yet.
I have now.
It's too big, Robespierre.
We'll never get back to find Mewsette.
It's not as big as you think, Jaune Tom.
Why, look.
It's just made up of little drops.
It's all how you look at it.
Honestly, Jaune Tom.
Jaune Tom?
There you are, shipmates.
I have good news!
We are headed for Alaska and the gold rush.
We will strike it rich, my friends.
Then we will return to Paris in style.
No time for games, little turtle.
The rain has stopped and I have work to do.
I must swab the deck, yes?
"Dear Mr. Phtt:
According to your instructions,
I am having Mewsette's portrait painted...
...by the most famous artists in Paris.
Many of them are not yet well-known in America...
...so please allow me to tell you a little bit about each one.
Claude Monet might well be said to be the father of the Impressionist movement.
You will notice how Monsieur Monet achieves a shimmering light...
...throughout the picture...
...and an impression of air and space.
A man of noble birth is
Monsieur Henri Toulouse-Lautrec...
...who is perhaps best known for his striking posters for the Moulin Rouge.
Pointillism is a highly individual style developed by Georges Seurat...
...in which he creates his astonishing effects...
...by the clever placing of tiny dots of paint...
...next to each other.
Henri Rousseau is an ex-soldier with no formal art training.
He is known as a 'primitive painter.'
With his vivid imagination...
...he is creating a charming world of his own...
...where oranges grow on banana trees.
Amedeo Modigliani is a talented young Italian painter...
...who shows great promise.
Sometimes his models have great difficulty holding the pose for him.
A Dutch painter who has found new inspiration here in Paris...
...is a man of violent temperament:
Vincent van Gogh.
To achieve a strong emotional impact...
...he sometimes applies paint directly from the tube.
Monsieur Edgar Degas frequently uses ballet dancers as his models.
To arrive at his delicate color harmonies...
...he often uses pastels instead of oil paints.
Don't be concerned when you see
Auguste Renoir's portrait.
Mewsette has not gotten fat.
Monsieur Paul Ceanne is an intellectual artist.
He is a masterful organier of color, composition and form.
His subjects often take on the aspects of a still life.
The dynamic Paul Gauguin has only recently returned from Tahiti...
...and his paintings show the influence of the South Sea Islands.
Another young painter here in Paris is a volatile Spaniard...
...who shows every indication of someday setting the art world afire.
His name is Pablo Picasso.
And so, hoping that you will enjoy them,
I ship these paintings on to you.
And tonight I am sending the original article:
Mewsette herself."
Here. Mail this letter, Armond.
Now, I want no slip-ups.
The train leaves at midnight.
I'll be back shortly with the belle of Paris.
I want you to see that she is comfortably settled in her...
...compartment.
I hope my little protegee is ready for her great adventure, sister.
She is, but you don't get her till I'm paid.
In full.
No money, no Mewsette.
Very well, then.
I'll write you a check.
- It's better than money.
- Now, that's more like it.
It will be well worth it, Meowrice.
Mewsette is my greatest achievement, my crowning glory.
For the sake of your dear neck,
I do hope so.
How gallantly you put your case, Meowrice.
No girl could resist you.
Judge for yourself whether you're getting your money's worth.
- Mewsette, chérie.
- Yes, dear Madame Rubens-Chatte?
- Why, brother. Don't tell me...?
- Momentary lapse, my dear.
Even cats are sometimes human.
Mewsette, my dear young friend, you are beautiful beyond compare.
Thank you, monsieur.
You are most kind.
Tonight I wish to speak to you of something very personal.
I think you will agree that before this night is over...
...all your dreams will come true.
Oh, Madame Rubens-Chatte, isn't it wonderful?
I do thank you for making it all possible.
Come, my dear. Paris awaits you.
And, dear madame, may I say everything that happens...
...is because of your faith in me?
I'll be back soon and tell you about it.
Don't wait up, sister.
It will be later than she thinks.
I'm going to miss that beautiful little thing.
Well, at least I've got this check to cheer me up.
What's happ...?
What's happening?
Why, that double-crosser! That crook!
He used disappearing ink.
Do you know, if the opportunity arose...
...to do him a disservice...
...I might not be able to resist it.
The moon is beautiful tonight, mon chérie.
Oh, yes. So romantic.
Step in here, my dear...
...out of the chill night wind.
What was it you wished to tell me, Meowrice?
Tonight I wish to speak of love and marriage.
You have thought of marriage, haven't you?
Yes, I...
- I suppose I have.
- Good.
Then I know just the one for you.
Here's his picture.
His name is Henry Phtt...
...of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, U.S.A.
You mean you want me to marry this...
...fat, old...?
- You are as bright as you are pretty.
So please get into the basket...
...like a good little bride-to-be.
- Who are they?
- Business associates, chérie.
Just get into the basket, and you won't have to look at them anymore.
Into the basket?
No! Oh, no!
Yes! Oh, yes!
You are going to Pittsburgh to marry that rich American.
Isn't that what you wanted?
Isn't that why you left the farm?
Yes. I mean, no.
I just...
I just want Jaune Tom.
Jaune Tom? You mean the world's greatest mouser?
Why, old Jaune Tom's probably in Alaska about now.
He is not. You're lying...
...just like you did about everything else.
Call it a weakness.
Now get into the basket.
No! I won't!
I'm not going to marry anybody!
After her, boys!
Don't let her fall!
I have already paid the postage.
Come down from there,
Armond, you idiot.
No time for second-story work tonight.
Well, why didn't you say so, you epithet?
Well, do you see her?
Hurry. Hurry!
You fools. Don't you see those paw prints?
This should be easy.
Let's go.
She's not down here.
Back the other way!
There she goes!
Get rid of that dog, you bumbling idiots!
Your whiskers tickle, cats.
And since I can't stand to be tickled by no cats...
...I'm gonna tear your tails off and have them for breakfast.
We understand your feelings, sir.
Nothing like cats' tails for breakfast...
...but back there, among those barrels, is a...
No! Please!
Let's talk this over.
After all I've done for you.
Taught you everything I know...
...made you despicable scoundrels beyond compare.
And what happens? You meet one little dog and I, Meowrice...
...have to save your miserable, worthless lives.
Now, get out there and find Mewsette.
Brave country, is it not, mes amis?
This weather, she's a little nippy for cats.
You could call it "catnip weather."
Catnip weather, no?
No. Well, I am discouraged too.
We come for gold, we find cold.
I tell you what.
Let's join the Foreign Legion.
We go to Africa and get warm again, eh?
Mon dieu! Little turtle, look!
We've struck it rich!
Jaune Tom, we're rich!
We're rich!
Wow!
We're rich! Now we can go back.
Six weeks. Six whole weeks lost.
Never send kittens to do a cat's job, I always say.
And now that I'm getting these splints off my tail...
How are you, baby?
Good as new?
Now, then!
We are going out and find Mewsette...
...or there will be four new violins in the world.
Lovely view, eh, mademoiselle?
Oh, no! Please!
If there was any other way,
I would have waited, Jaune Tom.
Nice fielding, team.
Come along. We'll take the scenic route home.
The first thing we do is head for that
Madame what's her name's salon...
...and they're bound to know where she is.
Come on, let's go.
Don't worry, Jaune Tom,
I'm right behind you.
There it is.
- Where's Mewsette?
- She's in danger.
- Yes, I know, but...
- They've taken her to Meowrice's...
...and I think she's still there.
- Thanks a lot.
- Yeah, thanks.
- Never mind the thanks.
Just give Meowrice my love and then turn him inside out.
Now, hurry. Hurry!
Canned fish?
What won't they think of next?
Everything is packaged these days.
Even pretty girls, hmm?
What?
Jaune Tom? The champion mouser?
At Madame Rubens-Chatte's?
Quick, then. We must be off to the train.
Grab the handles.
Put your backs into it.
Get moving, you idiots.
All right, lads, the coast is clear.
Let's go.
Mewsette.
Mewsette!
Mewsette, where are you?
Don't worry, Jaune Tom,
I'll be right there.
It's no use, Robespierre.
We're too late.
Nobody to...
...with?
Hey. Hey, wait a minute. Stop.
Look. There's a message.
"Jaune Tom, I'm being taken to the train."
Tears of gratitude, chérie?
Just think, in a few hours, you will be on a boat to America...
...and your new, old, rich husband.
Well, well, there are your little friends...
...down to bid you goodbye.
What are we gonna do?
I'm too pooped.
Au revoir, my children.
Don't forget to write.
Hey. Hey, maybe if I...
Maybe if I imagine...
Mewsette?
- Mewsette, where are you?
- Jaune Tom!
Good work, gentlemen.
Stop him, someone.
Toss him out the door, boys.
He ought to make quite a splash.
Jaune Tom, help!
They've got Robespierre!
Too late, my dear.
Are you all right, Mewsette?
You look all right.
I mean, at least your eyes do.
If you'll let me out now, Jaune Tom,
I'll show you how I really look.
Sure, sure.
What's the matter with me anyway?
It doesn't really matter, though.
Why, Jaune Tom, that's the nicest thing anybody ever said to me.
Jaune Tom, I've been such a fool.
Jaune Tom, look out!
You keep out of it, Robespierre.
Jaune Tom, hold it!
Stop.
"Mr. Henry Phtt.
1411 Sand Box Road."
Oh, yes.
Good idea, Robespierre.
Now, you go to beddy-bye, and when you wake up...
...you'll be on a boat going to meet that rich husband.
Right, Robespierre?
Please. Please don't say anything more. I'm dying.
I'm dying, I tell you!
[ENGLISH]
[Birds chattering and hooting]
[Narrator] Many strange legends
are told of these jungles of India,
but none so strange as the story
of a small boy named Mowgli.
It all began when the silence
of the jungle was broken
by an unfamiliar sound.
[Baby crying]
It was a sound like
one never heard before
in this part of the jungle.
[Crying continues]
It was a man cub!
Had I known how deeply
I was to be involved,
I would've obeyed
my first impulse and walked away.
[Baby laughing, cooing]
[Cooing and laughing]
This man cub would have
to have nourishment, and soon.
It was many days' travel
to the nearest man-village,
and without a mother's care,
he would soon perish.
- [Cooing continues]
- Then it occurred to me.
A family of wolves I knew
had been blessed
with a litter of cubs.
[Whining, whimpering]
[Barking]
[Loud crying]
[Cooing, laughing]
I knew there'd be no problem
with the mother,
thanks to the maternal instinct,
but I wasn't so sure
about Rama, the father.
[Sniffs]
[Crying]
[Cooing, laughing]
[Laughing continues]
Ten times, the rains
had come and gone,
and I often stopped by to see how
Mowgli, the man cub, was getting along.
He was a favourite with all
the young wolf cubs of the pack.
[Imitates howling]
[Howling]
- [Grunts]
- [Panting]
[Laughing]
[Whimpering]
No man cub was ever happier.
And yet, I knew that someday
he would have to go back
to his own kind.
[Wolf howling]
Then one night, the wolf pack
elders met at Council Rock
because Shere Khan, the tiger,
had returned
to their part of the jungle.
This meeting was to change
the man cub's entire future.
Shere Khan will surely kill the boy and all who try to protect him.
Now, are we all in agreement as to what must be done?
Now it is my unpleasant duty to tell the boy's father.
Rama.
Uh, come over here, please.
Yes, Akela?
The council has reached its decision.
The man cub can no longer stay with the pack.
He must leave at once.
"Leave"?
I'm sorry, Rama.
There is no other way.
But... But the man cub is...
Well, he's like my own son.
Surely he's entitled to the protection of the pack.
But, Rama, even the strength of the pack is no match for the tiger.
[Rama] But the boy cannot survive alone in the jungle.
Akela, perhaps
I can be of help.
You, Bagheera? How?
I know of a man-village where he'll be safe.
Mowgli and I have taken many walks into the jungle together.
I'm sure he'll go with me.
So be it. Now there's no time to lose.
Good luck.
Bagheera, I'm getting a little sleepy.
Shouldn't we start back home?
Mowgli, this time we're not going back.
- I'm taking you to a man-village.
- But why?
Because Shere Khan has returned to this part of the jungle...
...and he has sworn to kill you.
Kill me?
But why would he want to do that?
He hates man.
Shere Khan is not going to allow you to grow up to become a man, just another hunter with a gun.
Aw, we'll just explain to him that I'd never do a thing like that.
Nonsense. No one explains anything to Shere Khan.
Well, maybe so, but I'm not afraid.
- And besides, I...
- Now, that's enough.
We'll spend the night here.
Things will look better in the morning.
Man Cub?
Man Cub!
Now, come on. Up this tree.
It's safer up there.
Uh... I don't wanna go back to the man-village.
Go on. Up you go.
- That limb way up there?
- That's right.
[Laughing] Is that all the better you can climb?
[Grunting] It's too big around.
And besides, I don't have any claws.
[Grunting]
- Yeow-ohhh!
- [Snarling]
[Groaning]
Now get some sleep.
We've got a long journey ahead of us tomorrow.
I wanna stay in the jungle.
Huh? [chuckles]
You wouldn't last one day.
[Yawns]
I'm not afraid.
I... I can look out for myself.
[Smacking lips]
S-S-S-Say, now.
What have we here?
[Giggles] It's a man cub.
A delic-i-ous man cub.
Oh, go away and leave me alone.
[Yawns] Oh, that's just what
I should do, but I'm not.
Oh, now, please go to sleep, Man Cub.
Yes-s-s-s, Man Cub.
# Pleas-s-se go to sleep
# Please go to sleep
# S-S-Sleep, little man cub
# Rest in peace #
Sleep.
- S-S-S-Sleep.
- [Moaning]
Ba-Ba-Bagheera...
[gulps]
Oh, now... now, look, there's no use arguing anymore.
Now, no more talk till morning.
[Chuckles] He won't be here in the morning.
Huh? Oh, yes, he will. I...
Kaa! Hold it, Kaa!
[Grunts]
Ohhh!
My sinus-s-s-s-s.
You have just made a s-s-s-serious mistake, my friend, a very s-s-s-stupid...
[stammers] Now, Kaa, I was...
[Kaa]... mistake.
Look me in the eye when I'm speaking to you.
No, please, Kaa...
Both eyes, if you please.
You have just s-s-s-sealed your doom.
Ohhh... Aaah!
Aaah! Ooh.
Look, Bagheera.
Look. Bagheera.
Wake up, Bagheera.
[Groaning] Wha...?
Just you wait till I get you in my coils.
Uhhh!
[Mowgli laughing] Bagheera, he's got a knot in his tail!
"He's got a knot in his tail."
[Grunting]
[Moaning] This is going to slow down my s-s-s-slithering.
[Laughing]
- [Laughing stops]
- [Nervous chuckle]
So, you can look out for yourself, can you?
So, you want to stay in the jungle, do you?
Yes, I wanna stay in the jungle.
Ohhh! Now, now, for the last time, go to sleep.
[Muttering] Man cub. Huh!
Man cub. Ahhh.
[Yawns]
[Snoring]
[Rumbling]
# Hup, two, three, four
# Keep it up
Two, three, four
- # Hup, two, three, four
- [snoring]
# Keep it up two, three, four
- [yawns]
- # Hup, two, three, four
A parade!
Oh, no.
The dawn patrol again. [sighs]
Company... sound off!
# Oh, the aim of our patrol
# Is a question rather droll
# For to march and drill
over field and hill
[trumpeting]
# Is a military goal
# Is a military goal
# Hup, two, three, four
# Dress it up, two, three, four
# By the ranks or single file
# Over every jungle mile
# Oh, we stamp and crush
through the underbrush
[squeaky trumpeting]
# In the military style
[all] # In the military style
Hello. What are you doing?
Shh! Drilling.
- Can I do it too?
- Sure. Just do what I do.
But don't talk in ranks.
It's against regulations.
[Leader] To the rear... march!
The other way. Turn around.
[Leader] # Hup, two, three, four
# Keep it up, two, three, four #
To the rear...
...ho!
Company... halt!
That means "stop."
Company... left face!
March, march, march.
My feet are killing me.
I'm puttin' in for a transfer to another herd.
Silence in the ranks!
- Dress up that line.
- Oooh!
[Clearing throat]
Uh, pull it in, Winifred.
Inspection...
...arms!
[Whispering] Stick your nose out.
- [Whispering] Like this?
- That's right.
[Clicking tongue] A dusty muzzle.
Soldier, remember: In battle, that trunk can save your life.
Take good care of it, my man.
- Yes, sir.
- Very good. Carry on.
- [Clears throat]
- [Munching]
Let's have a little more spit and polish on those bayonets.
Yes, sir.
Esprit de corps.
That's the way I earned my commission in the Maharajah's
Fifth Pachyderm Brigade.
Back in '88, it was...
Or... Or was it?
Here it comes.
The Victoria Cross bit again.
It was then I received the Victoria Cross, for bravery above and beyond the call of duty.
Ha ha!
Those were the days.
Discipline! Discipline was the thing.
Builds character and that sort of thing, you know.
Eh... Uh... Oh.
Uh, where was I?
Oh, yes. Inspection. [clears throat]
Well, very good.
Wipe off that silly grin, soldier.
This is the army.
[Fly buzzing]
[Clears throat] Eyes front.
[Clicks tongue] Lieutenant, that haircut is not regulation.
Rather on the gaudy side, don't you think?
There. That's better.
And as for you...
Oh, there you are.
[Chuckles]
Let's keep those heels together, shall we, son?
OK, Pop.
- Sir.
- Yes, now that's better.
Well, a new recruit, eh?
[Laughs]
- I say, what happened to your trunk?
- Hey!
- Stop that!
- [Gasps, sputtering]
A man cub! Ohh, this is treason!
Sabotage!
I'll have no man cub in my jungle!
- It's not your jungle!
- Hold it! Hold it!
I can explain, Hathi.
Colonel Hathi, if you please, sir.
Oh, yes, yes. Colonel Hathi.
The man cub is with me.
I'm taking him back to the man-village.
- To stay?
- You have the word of Bagheera.
Good.
And remember, an elephant never forgets.
[Muttering] I don't know what the army's coming to these days.
These young whippersnappers.
Who do they think they are?
[Clears throat] Let's get on with it!
Right face!
Forward... march!
Dear, haven't you forgotten something?
Nonsense, Winifred, old girl.
An elephant never forgets.
Well, you just forgot our son.
Uh, our s... Son? Son!
Oh, yes, yes, yes. Quite right.
To the rear... march!
When I grow up,
I'm gonna be a colonel just like my...
If I've told you once,
I've told you a thousand times...
- Pop! Look out!
- [Groaning]
- [Thudding]
- [Groaning]
Ohhh! Oww!
Ohhh! Owww! Oooh!
Gee, Pop, you forgot to say "halt."
[Giggling]
He said an elephant never forgets.
- [Laughing stops]
- It's not funny.
Let's get out of here quick before anything else happens.
Bagheera! Where are we goin'?
You're going back to the man-village right now.
I'm not going.
- Oh, yes, you are.
- I'm staying right here.
You're going, if I have to drag you every step of the way.
[Grunting] Let go, you...
You let go of me! [grunting]
[Splash]
[Sputtering]
Ohh!
Oh, that does it.
I've had it, Man Cub.
From now on, you're on your own...
...alone!
Don't worry about me.
[Sighs] Foolish man cub.
[Rustling]
[Munching, slurps]
# Doo-bee, doo-bee
Doo-bee-dee-doo
# Well, it's a-doo-bah-dee-doo
# Yes, it's a-doo-bah-dee-doo
# I mean, a-doo-bee, doo-bee
Doo-bee, doo-bee
# Doo-bee-dee-doo
# And with... #
Well, now. Ha ha.
What have we here?
[Sniffs]
Hmm. Hey!
What a funny little bit of a...
- Ooh!
- Go away!
Oh, boy, I've seen everything in these woods.
Ooh, what have I run on?
- What a pretty thing this is.
- Leave me alone.
Well, now, that's pretty big talk, little britches.
I'm big enough.
- [Chuckles]
- [Grunting]
[Clicks tongue] Pitiful.
Hey, kid, you need help and ol' Baloo's gonna learn you to fight like a bear.
Come on. I'm gonna show ya.
[Growls]
Ha ha! Yeah!
All right, now, kid, loosen up.
Get real loose, then start to weave.
Weave a little. Now, move.
That's it. Now give me a big bear growl.
- Scare me.
- [Tiny growl]
[Clicks tongue]
Oh, boy.
I'm talkin' about like a big bear.
[Loud roar]
[Roaring continues]
He's in trouble.
I shouldn't have left him alone.
[Growls]
- [Loud roar]
- [Roaring]
- A big one, right from your toes.
- How's that?
[Mowgli continues roaring]
[Baloo laughs] You're gettin' it, kid.
Oh, no! It's Baloo!
That shiftless, stupid jungle bum.
Weave about now.
Look for an opening.
Keep movin'. Keep... [laughs]
You're gettin' it, kid.
Come on! That's it! [laughing]
He's a dandy!
[Chuckles] Fine teacher you are,
Ol' Iron Paws.
Oh! Thanks, Bagheera.
Tell me, tell me, after you knock your pupil senseless, how do you expect him to remember the lesson, hmm?
Well, I... I, uh...
Well, I didn't mean to lay it on him so hard.
I'm not hurt. I'm all right.
I'm a lot tougher than some people think.
You better believe it.
Now, let's go once more.
I want you to keep circlin', or
I'm gonna knock your roof in again.
You'd better keep movin'... Ooh!
Hey! Right on the button.
[Groans]
[Laughs] No. No, no.
No, no. Now you're ticklin'.
[Laughs] No. No, no.
No, no. Now you're ticklin'.
[Laughing]
No. No, n-now, we don't do that here in the jun... No!
No, you're ticklin'.
I can't stand that ticklin'.
[Laughing] Help! Bagheera!
Oh, boy. That's all he needs, more confidence.
- Give up, Baloo?
- I give up, I told ya!
Ha ha! Oooh! I give...
Hey! Ha ha!
You know somethin'?
You're all right, kid.
What do they call you?
Mowgli, and he's going back to the man-village right now.
Man-village? They'll ruin 'im!
They'll make a man out of him.
Oh, Baloo, I wanna stay here with you.
Certainly, you do.
Oh? And just how do you think he will survive?
"How do you think..."
What do you mean, how do you think he...
He's with me, ain't he?
And I'll learn him all I know.
Oh? That shouldn't take too long.
Look, now, it's like this, little britches.
All you gotta do is...
# Look for the bare necessities
# The simple bare necessities
# Forget about your worries
and your strife
# I mean, the bare necessities
# Are Mother Nature's recipes
# That bring
the bare necessities of life
- # Wherever I wander
- Ooof!
# Wherever I roam
# I couldn't be fonder
# Of my big home
# The bees are buzzin' in the tree
# To make some honey just for me
# When you look under
the rocks and plants
# And take a glance
at the fancy ants
# Then maybe try a few
You eat ants?
Ha ha! You better believe it.
And you're gonna love the way they tickle.
- [Gasps] Mowgli, look out!
- [Thud]
# The bare necessities of life
will come to you
But when?
# They'll come to you
# Look for the bare necessities
# The simple bare necessities
# Forget about your worries
and your strife
# I mean, the bare necessities
# That's why a bear can rest at ease
# With just the bare necessities of life
# Now, when you pick a pawpaw
- # Or a prickly pear
- Oww!
# And you prick a raw paw
Well, next time beware
# Don't pick the prickly pear
by the paw
# When you pick a pear
try to use the claw
# But you don't need
to use the claw
# When you pick a pear
of the big pawpaw
# Have I given you a clue?
Golly, thanks, Baloo.
"Pawpaw." Ha!
Of all the silly gibberish.
Come on, Baggy, get with the beat.
# The bare necessities of life
will come to you
- They'll come to me!
- # They'll come to you
How 'bout scratchin' that left shoulder while you're up there, Mowgli?
No. Just a hair lower.
There. Right there. That's it. Ohh!
This is beautiful. Oooh, that's good.
Kid, we've got to get to a tree.
This calls for some big scratchin'.
[Laughing] You're lots of fun, Baloo.
[Moaning] Right on it.
Yeah!
That's delicious.
Ohhh! Oooh!
Just a little bit... Mmm.
Yeah! Ha ha!
Oooh!
Mmm!
Mmm!
Ha ha! Oooh!
Yeah!
Oh, man. This is really livin'.
So just try and relax. Yeah.
Cool it.
Fall apart in my backyard.
'Cause let me tell you somethin', little britches...
- [buzzing]
- If you act like that bee...
Uh-uh. You're workin' too hard.
And don't spend your time...
...lookin' around...
...for something you want...
...that can't be found.
# When you find out
you can live without it
# And go along not thinkin' about it
# I'll tell you somethin' true
# The bare necessities of life
will come to you
[sighs] I give up.
Well, I hope his luck holds out.
Mowgli, how about you singin'?
[Together]
# Look for the bare necessities
# The simple bare necessities
# Forget about your worries
and your strife
- Yeah, man!
- # I mean, the bare necessities
# That's why a bear
can rest at ease
# With just the bare necessities of life
Yeah!
# With just the bare necessities of life
- # Yeah, man #
- Ha ha ha!
Beautiful. That's real jungle harmony.
I like being a bear.
That's my boy.
You're gonna make one swell bear.
Why, you even sing like one.
Yeah.
[Yawns]
# Doo-bee-doo
# Doo-bee-doo
# Aye-bee doogie-woogie doo
[fly buzzing]
Hey, Mowgli, how about you flickin' that ol' mean fly off of your papa bear's nose?
Ouch!
[Chuckles] Boy, when you flick a fly, you really...
Why, you flat-nosed, little-eyed, flaky creep!
Hey! Let go of me!
[Monkeys laughing]
Take your flea-pickin' hands off of my cub!
Come on and get 'im, champ!
- He ain't no champ! He's a chump!
- Baloo!
Yeah! Ha ha! A big hothead!
OK, you guys asked for it. I'll...
- Oooh!
- That'll cool 'im off! [laughing]
Gimme back my man cub!
Here he is! Come and get 'im!
[Monkeys chattering, hooting]
That's how a bear can rest at ease!
Here's some bare necessities!
Now, just try that again, you...
- What's that you hit him with, son?
- That was a bare necessity!
You turn him loose, or I'll jerk a knot in your tail!
We give up!
- Here he comes!
- Whoa-ohh-ohh!
- Baloo! Catch me!
- [Monkeys laughing]
- Baloo!
- Back up! Back up! Faster! Faster!
Faster!
- [Giggling]
- A rolling bear gathers no hair!
Baloo, help me!
Baloo! They're carrying me away!
Bagheera!
[Echoing] Bagheera!
Well, it's happened.
Took a little longer than I thought, but it's happened.
[Grunting]
- Bagheera!
- [Snarls]
[Echoing] Bagheera!
Oh, you heard me, huh?
Mowgli. Mowgli!
All right, what happened?
Where's Mowgli?
They ambushed me.
Thousands of 'em.
I jabbed with my left, then I swung with a right...
Oh, for the last time, what happened to Mowgli?
Like I told ya, them mangy monkeys carried him off!
The ancient ruins.
Ohh, I hate to think what will happen when he meets that king of theirs.

I'll tear 'im limb from limb.
I'll beat 'im. I'll... I'll...
Mmm. Yeah!
Well, man, what a beat.
Will you stop that silly beat business and listen?
This will take brains, not brawn.
You better believe it, and I'm loaded with both.
- Will you listen?
- Oh! Yeah, yeah.
Now, while you create a disturbance,
I'll rescue Mowgli.

Whew!
[Laughs]
Man, that's what I call a swingin' party!
And furthermore, Baloo,
Mowgli seems to have man's ability to get into trouble, and your influence hasn't been exactly...
Shh! Keep it down.
You're gonna wake up little buddy.
- [Bagheera groans]
- Well, he's had a big day.
It was a real sockeroo.
You know, it ain't easy learnin' to be like me.
Hah! A disgraceful performance.
Associating with those undesirable, scatterbrained apes?
[Scoffs] I hope Mowgli learned something from that experience.

Over here. I'd like to have a word with you.
"A word"?
You gonna talk some more?
[Yawns]
All right, what's up, Bagheera?
Baloo, the man cub must go back to the man-village.
The jungle is not the place for him.
I grew up in the jungle.
Take a look at me.
Yes, just look at yourself.
Look at that eye.
Yeah.
It's beautiful, ain't it?
Frankly, you're a disreputable sight.
Well, you don't look exactly like a basket of fruit yourself.
Ohhh! [clears throat]
Uh, Baloo, you can't adopt Mowgli as your son.
Why not?
How can I put it?
Baloo, birds of a feather should flock together.
You wouldn't marry a panther, would you?
I don't know.
[Laughs] Come to think of it, no panther ever asked me.
Oh, Baloo, you've got to be serious about this.
Oh, stop worryin', Baggy.
Stop worryin'.
I'll take care of him.
Yes, like you did when the monkeys kidnapped him, huh?
- Can't a guy make one mistake?
- Not in the jungle.
And another thing, sooner or later
Mowgli will meet Shere Khan.
The tiger? What's he got against the kid?
He hates man with a vengeance.
You know that.
Because he fears man's gun and man's fire.
But little Mowgli don't have those things.
Shere Khan won't wait until he does.
He'll get Mowgli while he's young and helpless.
Just one swipe and...
Ohh!
Well... Well, what are we gonna do?
We'll do what's best for the boy.
You better believe it.
You name it, and I'll do it.
Good. Then make Mowgli go to the man-village.
Are you out of your mind?
I promised him he could stay here in the jungle with me.
That's just the point.
As long as he remains with you, he's in danger.
- So it's up to you.
- Why me?
[Stammers] Because he won't listen to me.
I love that kid. [sniffles]
I love him like he was my own cub.
Then think of what's best for Mowgli and not yourself.
Uh, well, can't...
Can't I wait until morning?
It's morning now.
Go on, Baloo.
[Sighs]
Uh...
[sighs]
[Gasps]
Oh, boy.
Mowgli. Mowgli.
Uh, it's time to get up.
[Yawns] Oh. Hi, Baloo.
Hi.
Hey, rub that ol' sleep outta your eyes.
You and me, we got a long walk ahead of us.
Swell. Gee, we'll have lots of fun together.
Sure. Yeah. Yeah.
Uh, all right, let's hit the trail, kid.
See ya around, uh, Bagheera.
Well, goodbye, Bagheera.
Me and Baloo, we've got things to do.
Goodbye, Man Cub...
...and good luck.
Come on, Baloo.
All we gotta do is...
# Look for the bare necessities
# Some good ol' bare necessities
# Forget about your worries
and your strife
# I mean, the bare necessities
# That's why a bear
can rest at ease
# With just the bare
necessities of life
Yeah!
# I'll live here in the jungle
all my life #
Yeah, man! I like being a bear.
Where we goin', Baloo?
Well, uh, it's, uh... Um...
Well, it's sorta new and, uh...
Oh, I don't care, as long as I'm with you.
Mowgli, uh, look, buddy, uh, there's somethin' I gotta tell ya.
Tell me what, Baloo?
Oh, gee whiz.
Now, how did ol' Baggy put it?
It's, uh...
Uh, uh, Mowgli... [chuckles]
You wouldn't marry a panther, would ya?
[Laughing] Gee, I don't even know what you're talking about.
[Growls]
Mowgli, don't you realize that you're a human?
I'm not anymore, Baloo.
I'm a bear like you.
- Little buddy, look, listen to me.
- Come on, Baloo!
- Mowgli, stop it now. Hold still.
- [Growling]
I wanna tell you something.
Now listen to me.
What's the matter, ol' Papa Bear?
Look, Mowgli, I've been tryin' all morning to tell ya,
I've got to take you back to the man-village.
- The man-village?
- Now, look, kid, I can explain.
- But you said we were partners.
- Now, believe me, kid, I...
- You're just like old Bagheera.
- Now just a minute!
That's goin' too far!
Hey, Mowgli! Where you goin'?
Wait a minute! Stop!
Wait!
Wait! Listen to ol' Baloo!
Mowgli!
Mowgli!
Mowgli!
Mowgli. Mowgli!
Now what's happened?
Well, y-you're not gonna believe me, Bagheera, but look, now, I used the same words you did, and he ran out on me!
Well, don't just stand there.
Let's separate. We've got to find him!
Oh, if anything happens to that little guy, I'll never forgive myself.
I gotta find him.
Mowgli!
Mowgli!
[Elephants trumpet]
# Hup, two, three, four
# Hup, two, three, four
# Keep it up, two, three, four
What beastly luck.
Confound that ridiculous Colonel Hathi.
Company... sound off!
# Oh, we march from here to there
# And it doesn't matter where
# You can hear us push
through the deepest bush
# Hup, two, three, four
[Hathi] # With a military air
[all] # With a military air
[trumpeting]
The jungle patrol!
# We're a crackerjack brigade
# On a pachyderm parade
# But we'd rather stroll
to a water hole
# Hup, two, three, four
[all] # For a furlough in the shade #
Stop!
Wait a minute. Halt!
- Ohh! Ohh!
- [Thudding]
Who said "halt"?
I give the commands around here.
Well, speak up. Who was it?
Oh, it was me, Colonel.
What do you mean, sir, taking over my command? Highly irregular, you know.
Oh, Colonel, I'm sorry, but I need your help.
[Hathi] Oh, absolutely impossible.
We're on a cross-country march.
[Bagheera] But it's an emergency,
Colonel.
- The man cub must be found.
- [Hathi] Man cub? What man cub?
How interesting.
The one I was taking to the man-village.
Good. That's where he belongs.
Now, sir, if you don't mind, we'd like to get on with the march.
[Bagheera] No, no, you don't understand, Hathi.
He is lost. He ran away.
How delightful.
Well, it serves the young whippersnapper right.
But... But Shere Khan, the tiger, is sure to pick up the man cub's trail.
[Chuckles]
Shere Khan. Nonsense, old boy.
Shere Khan isn't within miles of here.
[Chuckling]
Oh, sorry, Bagheera. Fortunes of war and all that sort of thing, you know.
This has gone far enough.
Far enough!
Now, just a minute, you pompous old windbag!
Winifred! What are you doing out of ranks?
Never mind.
How would you like to have our boy lost and alone in the jungle?
[Hathi] Our son... alone?
But, Winifred, old girl, that's an entirely different matter.
- [Scoffs]
- Different, entirely.
That little boy is no different than our own son.
Now you help find him or I'm taking over command.
What? A female leading my herd?
Utterly preposterous.
Pop, the man cub and I are friends.
He'll get hurt if we don't find him.
Please, Pop, sir? Please?
Now, don't you worry, son.
Your father had a plan in mind all the time.
[Scoffs] Sure you did.
[Sputtering] Troopers!
Company... left face!
Volunteers for a special mission will step one pace forward.
Ha ha! That's what I like to see.
Devotion to duty.
Now, you volunteers will find the lost man cub.
Oh, thank you, Colonel.
There's no time to lose.
Yes. Yes.
Uh, Bugler, when the man cub is sighted, you will sound your trumpet three times.
Yes, sir.
- [Trumpeting]
- [Hathi] Shh!
Not now, soldier.
[Nasal] Sorry, sir.
Lieutenant, our strategy shall be the element of surprise.
[Whispering] You will take one squad and cover the right flank.
[Lieutenant] Yes, sir.
[Whispering] And I shall meet the other squad on the left flank.
Very well.
[Shouting] Company...
[shout echoing]
...forward... march!
Element of surprise?
Oh, I say.
[Chuckling]
And now for my rendezvous with the little lost man cub.
Kaa! It's you!
Yes-s-s, Man Cub.
So nice to see you again.
[Giggling, hissing]
Oh, go away. Leave me alone.
Let me look at you.
You don't want me to look at you?
Then you look at me.
No, sir. I know what you're trying to do, Kaa.
You do?
Uh, I mean, you don't trust me.
- No.
- Then there's nothing I can do to help.
You want to help me?
[Hisses] Certainly.
I can see to it...
...that you never have to leave this jungle.
How could you do that?
Hmm?
Oh, I have my own...
...s- s-subtle little ways. [chuckles]
But first, you must trust me.
I don't trust anyone anymore.
I don't blame you.
I'm not like those so-called fair-weather friends of yours.
You can believe in me.
# Trust in me
# Just in me
# Shut your eyes
# And trust in me
Hold still, please.
# You can sleep
# Safe and sound
# Knowing I
# Am around
# Slip into silent slumber
# Sail on a silver mist
# Slowly and surely
# Your senses will cease to resist
[snoring]
You're snoring.
Sorry.
# Trust in me
# And just in me
# Shut your eyes
# And trust in me #
- [doorbell rings]
- Huh?
Oh, now what?
I'll be right down.
Yes? Yes? Who is it?
It's me, Shere Khan.
Uh, I'd like a word with you, if you don't mind.
Shere Khan.
What a s-s-surprise.
Yes, isn't it? I just dropped by.
Forgive me if I've interrupted anything.
Oh, no, no. Nothing at all.
I thought perhaps you were entertaining someone up there in your coils.
Coils? Someone? Oh, no.
I was just curling up for my siesta.
But you were singing to someone.
- Who is it, Kaa?
- [Gulps] Uh, who?
[Coughs] Oh, no.
- I was just singing to myself.
- Indeed.
Yes. Yes, you see,
I have trouble with my s-s-sinuses.
- What a pity.
- Oh, you have no idea.
It's simply terrible. I can't eat.
I can't s-s-sleep, so I sing myself to sleep.
You know, self-hypnosis?
Let me show you how it works.
# Trust in me
- [muffled coughs]
- I can't be bothered with that.
I have no time for that sort of nonsense.
- [Hisses] Some other time, perhaps?
- Perhaps.
But at the moment
I am searching for a man cub.
"Man cub"? What man cub?
The one who's lost.
Now, where do you suppose he could be?
Search me.
That's an excellent idea. [chuckling]
I'm sure you wouldn't mind showing me your coils, would you, Kaa?
Uh, [hisses] certainly not.
Nothing here, and nothing in here.
[Snoring]
[Snorting]
My sinuses.
Hmm. Indeed.
And now, how about the middle?
The middle?
Oh, the middle.
[Laughing] Absolutely nothing in the middle.
Hmm.
Really?
Well, if you do just happen to see the man cub, you will inform me first.
- Understand?
- [Gulps] I get the point.
- Cross my heart, hope to die.
- Good show.
And I must continue my search for the helpless little lad.
Ooh, who does he think he's fooling?
"Helpless little lad."
Ooh, he gives me the s-s-shivers.
Picking on that poor little helpless boy. [sighs]
Oh, yes.
The poor little helpless boy.
Aaah!
[Grunts, groans]
You told me a lie, Kaa.
You said I could trust you.
It's like you said.
You can't trust anyone.
If I never see that skinny little shrimp again, it will be too soon.
Ooh, my s-s-sacroiliac.
[Thunder rumbling]
[Yawns]
Hey, Flaps. What we gonna do?
I don't know. What do you wanna do?
I've got it! Let's flap over to the east side of the jungle.
They've always got a bit of action, a bit of a swingin' scene.
Aw, come off it!
Things are right dead all over.
You mean you wish they were.
[Laughing]
[All laughing]
Very funny.
OK, so what we gonna do?
I don't know. What do you wanna do?
Look, Flaps, first I say,
"What we gonna do?"
Then you say, "I don't know.
What do you wanna do?"
"What we gonna do?"
"What you wanna do?"
What we gonna do, what you want...
Let's do something!
OK. What do you want to do?
Oh, blimey. There you go again.
The same notes again.
I've got it!
This time, I've really got it.
So you've got it.
So what we gonna do?
Hold it, lads.
Look. Look what's coming our way.
Hey, what in the world is that?
What a crazy looking bunch of bones.
Yeah, and they're all walking about by themselves.
[All laughing]
- So what we gonna do?
- I don't know.
Hey, now, don't start that again.
Come on, lads. Come on.
Let's have some fun with this little fella, this little bloke, eh?
Blimey! He's got legs like a stork, he has.
Like a stork. Ha ha!
But he ain't got no feathers, he ain't.
[Laughter]
Go ahead. Laugh. I don't care.
[Thunder rumbling]
What's wrong with him?
I think we overdid it.
We were just having a bit of fun, that's all.
Oh, just look at him.
Why, the poor little fella.
You know, he must be down on his luck.
Yeah, or he wouldn't be in our neighbourhood.
Hey, new kid! Wait a minute! Hey!
Just leave me alone.
Oh, come on. What's wrong?
You look like you haven't got a friend in the world.
- I haven't.
- Haven't you got a mother or a father?
No. Nobody wants me around.
Yeah. We know how you feel.
Nobody wants us around either.
Oh, we may look a bit shabby, but we've got hearts.
And feelings too.
And just to prove it to you, we're going to let you join our little group.
Kid, we'd like to make you an honorary vulture.
Thanks, but I...
I'd rather be on my own alone.
Oh, now, look, kid.
Everybody's got to have friends.
Hey, fellas, are we his friends?
# We're your friends
[harmonizing]
# We're your friends
# We're your friends
to the bitter end
# The bitter end
# When you're alone
# When you're alone
# Who comes around
# Who comes around
# To pluck you up
- Give us a smile.
- # To pluck you up
# When you are down
# When you are down
# And when you're outside looking in
# Who's there to open the door?
- Come on, kid. We need a tenor.
- # That's
# What
# Friends are for
# Who's always eager to extend
# A friendly claw
# That's what friends are for
# And when you're lost
# In dire need
# Who's at your side
# At lightning speed
# We're friends with every creature
comin' down the pike
# In fact, we've never met
an animal we didn't like
Ha ha! You take it, kid.
# Didn't like
- # So, you can see we're friends
- # Friends in need
# We're friends in need
and friends indeed
# Friends indeed
- # Oh, friends indeed
- Whoops! Ooh!
- Easy, lads. Steady. Watch it!
- # We'll keep you safe in the jungle
# Forevermore
# That's what friends
# Are for #
Bravo. Bravo.
An extraordinary performance.
And thank you for detaining my victim.
Uh, don't mention it, Your Highness.
[Chuckling]
- Boo!
- [Sputtering, yelling]
- Let's get out of here.
- Gimme room! Gangway!
- [Thunder crashing]
- Run, friend! Run!
"Run"? Why should I run?
Why should you run?
Could it be possible that you don't know who I am?
I know you, all right.
- You're Shere Khan.
- Precisely.
Then you should also know that everyone runs from Shere Khan.
You don't scare me.
I won't run from anyone.
Ah! You have spirit for one so small, and such spirit is deserving of a sporting chance.
Now, I'm going to close my eyes and count to ten.
It makes the chase more interesting... for me.
One...
...two, three...
...four...
You're trying my patience.
...five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
- [Thunder crashing]
- [Growling]
Run, Mowgli, run!
- Let go, you big oaf!
- Ooh!
Take it easy. Take it easy.
Hold it. Hold it. Hold it. Whoa!
- [Growling]
- Yeow! Whoa, slow! Easy, now!
- [Growling]
- [Stammering] Whoa! Easy!
He's got a tiger by the tail, he has.
And he better hang on too.
- Yeow!
- Take that, you big bully.
Let him have it again, kid!
Hit him again, kid! Go on!
- Baloo! Help me!
- [Shere Khan roaring]
Ooh!
Woo-woo-wooo-wooo!
- [Thunder crashing]
- [Growling]
Somebody do something with that kid!
Come on, lads!
He's safe now! Ha ha ha!
You can let go, Baloo.
Are you kiddin'?
There's teeth in the other end.
[Snarling]
- Ooof!
- [Thud]
- I'll kill you for this. [growling]
- [Thunder crashing]
Let go! Baloo needs help!
Fire! That's the only thing
Old Stripes is afraid of.
You get the fire. We'll do the rest.
Oof!
[All] Charge!
- Punch and blow!
- Stay out of this, you mangy fools!
Yeah, yeah. Missed me a mile, he did!
[Vultures laughing]
- Yeah, pull his blinkin' whiskers!
- [Laughter]
He's a bloomin' pussycat, he is!
Look behind you, chum.
[Roaring]
[Snarling, roaring]
[Thunderclap]
- Well, that's the last of him.
- [Laughter]
[Laughter continues]
Old Stripes took off like a flaming comet, he did.
Well, come on. Let's go congratulate our friend.
Hold it, fellas.
Now is not the time for it. Look.
Baloo?
Baloo, get up.
Oh, please, get up.
[Sniffs] Oh.
Mowgli, try to understand.
Bagheera, what's the matter with him?
You've got to be brave, like Baloo was.
You... You don't mean...
Oh, no. Baloo.
[Sniffles]
Now, now. I know how you feel.
But you must remember, Mowgli,
"Greater love hath no one than he who lays down his life for his friend."
When great deeds are remembered in this jungle, one name will stand above all others:
Our friend, Baloo the bear.
[Sniffling] He's crackin' me up.
The memory of Baloo's sacrifice and bravery will forever be engraved on our saddened hearts.
Beautiful.
This spot where Baloo fell will always be a hallowed place in the jungle, for there lies one of nature's noblest creatures.
[Sniffling]
I wish my mother could have heard this.
It's best we leave now.
Come along, Man Cub.
Hey, don't stop now, Baggy.
You're doin' great!
There's more. Lots more!
Why, you big fraud!
[Stammers] You four-flusher!
I'm-I'm fed up! [sputtering]
- Baloo, you're all right!
- [Chuckles]
Who, me? Sure I am.
Never felt... better.
[Laughter]
- You sure had us worried.
- Aw, I was just takin' five.
You know, playin' it cool.
- [Chuckling] But he was too easy.
- Good old Papa Bear.
It's going to be a bit dull without the little bloke, isn't it?
Yeah. So what we gonna do?
I don't know...
Now, don't start that again!
Hey, Baggy.
Too bad you missed the action.
You should have seen how I made a sucker out of Old Stripes with that left up in his face.
"Boom, boom," I was givin' him. "Wham!"
Wanna know somethin'?
We're good sparring partners.
- [Laughs] You'd better believe it.
- Yes, sir.
Nothing or nobody is ever gonna come between us again.
[Girl] # My own home
# My own home
# My own home
# My own home
- Look! What's that?
- [humming]
- Oh, it's the man-village.
- No, no. I mean that.
Forget about those.
They ain't nothing but trouble.
Just a minute.
I've never seen one before.
So you've seen one. So let's go.
I'll be right back.
I want a better look.
- Mowgli, wait a minute!
- Oh, Baloo.
Let him have a better look.
[Humming continues]
# Father's hunting in the forest
# Mother's cooking in the home
# I must go to fetch the water
# Till the day that I am grown
# Till I'm grown
# Till I'm grown
# I must go to fetch the water
# Till the day that I am grown
[giggles]
# Then I will have a handsome husband
# And a daughter of my own
# And I'll send her to fetch the water
# I'll be cooking in the home
[humming]
# Then I'll send her to fetch the water
# I'll be cooking in my home #
Oh!
- She did that on purpose!
- Obviously.
[Humming]
Mowgli, come back. Come back.
Go on. Go on.
He's hooked.
Ah, it was inevitable, Baloo.
The boy couldn't help himself.
It was bound to happen.
Mowgli is where he belongs now.
Yeah.
I guess you're right.
But I still think he'd have made one swell bear.
Well, come on, Baggy, buddy.
Let's get back to where we belong.
And get with the beat.
- # Look for the bare necessities
- [grunts]
# The simple bare necessities
# Forget about your worries
and your strife
[both] # I mean the bare necessities
# Are Mother Nature's recipes
# That bring the bare necessities
of life #
Wake up, Manhattan.
Come out of that warm, rosy dream.
Open those big, luscious eyes... and meet a new, exciting day.
I'm talking to you ravishing, delicious, madcap girls... still in that warm, cozy bed.
Now, what you need is a nice, hot cup of coffee...
Bentley coffee, of course.
Do you get that rich, intoxicating aroma... that tantalizing blend... that makes the senses reel and the pulses tingle?
Look out!
Don't burn those delicate, sensuous fingers.
Why, if anything should happen to those wild, impetuous hands...
Jones would be heartbroken.
Did she hurt herself? Don't cry.
Old Norm here will fix it.
There now. Doesn't that feel better?
- Good morning, Mr. Corbett.
- Good morning.
- You forgot to leave a note.
- What?
Do you want your milk cut down to a quart a day?
We can try a quart and feel it out from there.
Right. Fine. That's a good idea.
Eddie? Breakfast ready.
Eddie?
Come on now, Eddie.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- What are you doing in here?
- Sleeping.
Yeah, I know. I can see that.
This happens to be my bed, you know.
When did you crawl in here?
Last night. I got cold.
Are you mad at me?
Why should I be mad at you?
But you were never much of a one for bed-hopping, you know.
Come on now. We don't want to be late our first day back at school now, do we?
Do I have to clean my teeth?
You betcha. Teeth, face, and hands.
By the way, when was the last time you took a bath?
I had a whole one at Aunt Judy's.
I mean from top to bottom.
That was two days ago, wasn't it?
You don't know how clean I got.
Aunt Judy put something in the water that took off all my tan.
- All the dirt, you mean.
- No, tan, Dad.
When you get that clean you look all pink and skinny.
I hate myself.
Yeah, well, hate yourself later.
Get into that bathroom.
Come on now. Let's move.
Dad, you're not a husband anymore, are you?
You can't wear those trousers to school.
Are you out of your mind?
It's only fingerpaint, Dad.
The teacher knows it ain't dirt.
Put them down.
Okay.
Okay.
- Dad?
- Yeah.
Bobby Wheeler don't brush his teeth everyday.
So what?
He's got more teeth left than I do.
Look, never mind Bobby Wheeler.
You just...
What's this?
A watch.
It's indelible.
It's got to wear off.
- Dad?
- Yeah.
You didn't tell me about the husband part.
No, I'm not a husband anymore.
You just get dressed or you're not gonna get any breakfast.
Come on. Let's go, Eddie.
Okay, Dad.
I'll be here to pick you up at lunchtime, okay?
Okay.
You better pull your sleeve down.
No, the one over the wristwatch.
My shirt itches, Dad.
It shouldn't. It's one of your regular shirts.
Matter of fact, that's the one that Mommy ironed.
Eddie, don't fool around inside.
I'll be here right at lunchtime.
- Dad?
- Yes?
Is Mommy really dead?
- Yes, Eddie. She is.
- Gosh.
Gosh.
I never thought of that.
You may be right, Mr. Corbett.
Mr. Corbett, how nice to have you back, sir.
Thank you, Leigh.
I can't tell you how shocked we all were, sir.
That's very kind of you.
All the bad ones in the world, and the good ones have to go.
How true.
Anne, would you come in for just a minute, please?
I won't stay long.
I want to pick up Eddie for lunch.
- Where are the letters to be signed?
- They're in the top left drawer.
I checked the housekeeper.
She'll be reporting around noon.
The agency recommended her highly... but you can never tell about these sleep-outs.
- Sleep-outs?
- Yes. She sleeps out.
You know, you really ought to have a sleep-in.
It's a shame you don't have an extra bedroom.
Just a little tip, Mr. Corbett, stay close to her in the morning.
See if she has a peppermint breath.
The worst kind are those sneaky drinkers.
Yes?
I hate to bother you, but we have 10 young ladies here... with invitations to the Norman Jones show... but his control room's full already.
What do you want me to do about it?
- Can I ask them to come back later?
- Yes. You do that.
Anyway, if I were you, Mr. Corbett...
I just might keep an eye out on the washer machine.
They usually hide the bottles in there.
...and this stunning redhead whispered to me:
"Oh, Norm, hold me tighter."
Excuse me.
And now, for you.
For all you ravishing white-collars...
I dedicate this musical love letter.
Captain! My captain.
Are we off?
The shepherd returns.
We've been nothing without you. Nothing.
You seem to be doing pretty well without me.
- What? Oh, that.
- Yeah.
Norm, you know we do not have visitors on this show, right?
They're not visitors. They're friends.
That one there on the left, the blonde?
She won my last secret word contest.
What was the secret word?
"Yes"?
That's funny.
We can't have women running in and out like we're running a beauty contest.
That stuff on the air this morning with the coffee? I mean...
Are you seducing women on the air now?
Tom, I'm concerned about you.
One sec. Jones In The Morning.
Who?
Oh, sure. Hiya, lover.
Sure, I meant it. Yeah.
How about tomorrow night? 8:00.
I'm concerned about you.
You look terrible.
Tired, worried.
This whole thing has been hell for you.
Look, why don't you relax for an evening?
Try to forget.
I happen to know this living doll.
- Great company. She lives on 72nd Street.
- No.
- A little harmless companionship.
- No.
I'm only trying to help.
You and just about everybody else.
You're gonna make yourself sick.
Take it from me. Tom, friend...
Dearly beloved, listen closely.
Will I be helping out all the time now?
No. In fact the sleep-out housekeeper will be doing most of the cooking.
At least I hope so.
- Sleep-out?
- She sleeps out.
Out where? Outdoors?
No. She sleeps out of here.
Why? Are you mad at her?
Mad at her? How could I be mad at her?
I don't even know her.
Will she be my stepmother?
Come on now. Use your head, Eddie.
I'd have to marry her for that.
Say, Eddie, what did the teacher say today?
- About Mommy?
- Yeah.
She didn't say nothing.
Then how do you know she knows?
She kissed me, and she looked at me, and she let me pass out all the papers.
All that jazz.
What else did you do in school today?
Nothing much.
Come on, now, Eddie.
I'm sure you did something.
There was something I wanted to do, but I didn't.
Yeah? What was that?
I wanted to cry.
- Mr. Corbett?
- Yes.
I'm sorry. I'm very, very sorry.
I was held up on that transfer at Times Square.
Nice. Real nice.
We're gonna get along just swell.
- Fine.
- Where's the boy?
He's in the kitchen right through here.
We were just about to have lunch.
Eddie, this is Mrs. Livingston.
- How do you do?
- I'm fine, Eddie.
Just fine. But you're too skinny.
We'll take care of that, won't we?
Now, you two sit down and I'll get lunch for you in no time.
- Eddie, you'd better wash your hands.
- You mean, because she's here?
No, because they're dirty.
A dishwashing machine, a garbage disposal.
- You better watch out, Mr. Corbett.
- Yeah? What for?
- You better watch out for the floozies.
- The floozies?
There's women who would marry you right now... for the equipment you have in this apartment.
I see. Mrs. Livingston, would you mind telling me something?
What is this thing for here?
- That's my Instant Spanish.
- What?
It's a course I'm taking.
My daughter married a fella in South America.
They've invited me down there for six months.
I want to know what he's saying about me, see?
- Only he won't know I know.
- Very good.
- Dad?
- Yeah.
- Can I go to Joey's house for a minute?
- You can't.
- You gotta have lunch and get back to...
- Just for a minute?
- Why?
- I want to tell him the news.
You know, the news that Mommy died.
Okay.
Does he go around telling everyone like that?
No.
I think Joey's the very first.
¿Qué desea usted comer señora?
Yo deseo sopa, carne y café, por favor.
Lo siento mucho, pero no tenemos sopa.
Se equivoca, la sopa está en la lista de platos.
La sopa está en la lista de platos.
La sopa no está en la cocina, señora.
- Hi, Eddie.
- Hi, Dad.
¿Por qué está la sopa... en la lista de platos, y no está en la cocina?
¿Quiere un poco de vino señora?
¡Quisiera sopa! ¡Mozo, traigame sopa!
Si pudiera hacerlo lo haría.
No creo que pueda complacerla.
Usted es un mozo. Esto es un café.
La sopa es en la lista de platos.
¡ Traigamela, por favor!
¡Gracias, señora!
Veré que puedo hacer.
Mozo, quisiera sopa, carne y café, por favor.
- Sí, señora.
- Buenas noches.
- Sorry I'm late.
- That's all right.
Eddie's had his dinner, and is watching TV.
- I think I got everything on this list...
- I had a talk with that woman today.
- What woman?
- The one across the hall. Elizabeth Marten.
She's a divorcée, Mr. Corbett... and if you don't mind some advice,
I'd be very careful.
Very careful of what?
You take a bachelor.
He's out for one thing only... day in and day out, week in and week out.
One thing, one thing only.
That's your ordinary bachelor.
Mrs. Livingston, if that is ordinary, then I'm in a very bad way.
Suit yourself. Liquor won't solve a thing.
I'll get it.
- Hello, Tom.
- Hello.
Is Eddie still up?
I made some fudge, the kind he likes.
That's very kind of you, Elizabeth.
I know he should be asleep, but he's still up.
Come in.
It's chocolate with nuts. It's his favorite.
I assure you that he will flip over it.
- Sit down.
- No, thanks. I can't stay.
I just wanted to drop that off on my way to work.
How about a drink maybe?
Just a short one?
No, thanks.
My floor superintendent can detect one swallow at 30 yards.
She really has it in for volunteer nurses.
She thinks we're all out on some sort of social lark.
You like the work, though?
It keeps me busy.
- Elizabeth!
- Hello, Eddie. How are you?
Elizabeth made you some fudge.
- Boy. Has it got nuts?
- It's riddled with nuts.
Wow! Can I have a piece now, Dad?
- Can I have two?
- Why not?
If you brush your teeth extra hard.
- Boy!
- And, Eddie?
Put your pajamas on.
Tom, I just wanted to say how sorry I am.
You know how close Helen and I were.
- I guess she was just about my best friend.
- Yes, I know.
Fact is... when I opened the door and saw you there, I kind of... half-expected to see Helen standing right alongside you.
- And for a minute there...
- Tom, if there's anything I can do... like sitting with Eddie at night maybe, in case you want to go...
We're all right.
Eddie's going back to school now.
We're getting back into the normal routine. Before you...
What is it? Eddie, what is it?
Eddie, it's all right. It's all right.
It's all right.
- Stop. Stop.
- Eddie, please stop.
Eddie, please. Stop.
What did you do with him, Dad?
No, it wasn't a "him." It was an "it."
And I flushed it down the drain, Eddie.
It's okay, Dad.
Eddie, please. You got a half a dozen other fish there. They're all alive.
I know.
It's okay, Dad.
Eddie, you were thinking of your mother, weren't you?
Weren't you, Eddie?
Tom, I think he's gonna be all right now.
A fish is a fish.
- Tom.
- A fish is a fish...
- and his mother's his mother.
- That isn't the point.
He doesn't care about them.
I have to tell him to feed them.
- It takes about two seconds.
- He needed to cry.
- He can cry according to the size of things.
- It doesn't work that way.
I don't agree. Look, if you're sad, you cry.
You don't save up your tears and go to a sad movie, do you?
But we do. We all do.
Where do you think we get the tears we cry at movies?
Tears for a mother cannot be the same as tears for a fish.
Tom, can't we talk about this calmly?
- I want to help so much.
- Thank you very much.
Yeah, thank you for your kind fuss and for your fudge... but we're doing just fine.
I'm very sorry to bother you.
Please forgive me.
I know, Dad.
I know how much you miss Mommy.
I'm glad you know, Eddie.
Now that's something that we know about each other, isn't it?
Of course we miss Mommy... and very much.
And we will for a long time.
How long does it take, Dad?
Let me put it this way, Eddie.
No matter how long it takes we're gonna be all right... just as long as I can tell you everything that I feel... and you can tell me.
- Everything?
- Everything.
- Always?
- Always. I tell you what.
Let's you and I have a sort of a secret pact just between us.
Okay, Dad.
Eddie.
You know what I think, Dad?
I think they cheat in the movies.
- You do?
- I think they cheat with the horses.
How do they do that?
When they want the sheriff to catch the bad guy... they give the sheriff the best horse.
When they want the bad guy to get away...
- They give the bad guy the best horse.
- That's right. They cheat with the horses.
- How did you like it, Dad?
- I liked it fine.
But it didn't make you happy, did it?
- Make me happy?
- Yeah.
What can we do to make you happy, Dad?
Look, we're gonna have a nice
Chinese dinner together.
That'll make us both happy.
I know. Let's have a discussion.
You like discussions.
Okay.
- Are you ready, Dad?
- All right.
You ever think about getting married again?
No, Eddie, I don't.
Could you think about it now, Dad?
Out loud?
All right, we'll think about it now.
- First, you gotta find her, right?
- Right.
And after you find her, what happens?
Then you ask her to marry you.
And after she gives you the permission what do you do?
Do when?
- Aren't you listening, Dad?
- I'm sorry, Eddie.
- Then you go to a doctor.
- A doctor?
What do you want to do that for?
You see, in some states you have to have...
You pass a medical test in order to get a marriage license, you see.
- Could you pass it, Dad?
- Yeah, I think so.
What if the lady wasn't so healthy?
What if she don't pass?
Would you be mad?
Let's just say I'd be very disappointed.
Look, Dad. Look.
Look at that big turtle.
How about some skee-ball? We have time.
- Oh, boy!
- Come on.
- Dad?
- Yeah?
- Did you see her?
- Who?
- Her.
- Who?
The lady with the red hair.
Eddie, don't point.
Miss, change for a dollar, please.
Boy, she's beautiful.
Let's go, Eddie. Let's go.
You know, this is pretty tricky.
Look. She's coming over here.
Now look what you've done, Eddie.
Sir?
- Sir?
- Yes?
May I borrow your son for a few minutes?
I beg your pardon?
May I borrow your son for a few minutes?
We were playing ball here, you know...
Just for about 10 minutes, sir.
What for?
To get my picture painted on a tie.
That man over there, he does it for $3.
I'd like to send one to my father in Montana.
What's borrowing my son got to do with having your picture painted on a tie?
It wouldn't be so awful if I could sit there with your boy.
I wouldn't be so afraid.
- Afraid of what?
- Mashers.
What's a masher, Dad?
A masher is somebody that bothers women.
- Just bothers? That's all?
- Yeah. You...
Well, isn't that enough?
I thought you mean chopped 'em up or squashed 'em like a potato masher.
May I, sir?
Eddie, it would seem that you're about to be borrowed.
Thank you, sir.
Stick with her while she has her picture painted on the tie over there, all right?
- Thank you so much.
- All right.
Thanks.
Dad.
- Dad, she's giving the tie to me.
- To you?
Look, Dad! They already got the bodies on the tie.
He just paints on the head.
I'm sorry. Takes too much time,
I guess, to paint a person's whole body.
But my father...
If he ever saw an outfit like that.
- I'll wear it to school. Man!
- Man, you will not wear it to school.
They don't allow bikinis in the first grade.
- Sorry it didn't work out, Miss...
- Daly.
Dollye.
- Daly Dollye?
- Dollye Daly.
It doesn't matter.
- As long as I did it, that's what counts.
- That's right.
I'm supposed to do one thing every day... that I'm afraid to do, but I really want to do.
Here. It's part of my self-improvement course.
I see.
In fact, it's my first rule.
Become outgoing.
"Become outgoing."
It's very serious with me, sir.
I've ruined my whole life by not having poise and confidence.
I even lost out on the finals.
Finals of what?
- Miss Montana.
- I see.
I mean, physically I could've won it hands down.
Yes, I'm quite sure you could have.
Eddie.
When it came to the part where you have to get up in front of everybody... and talk for three minutes about yourself...
Look, I'll tell you what.
Suppose we buy you a drink?
- Thank you.
- All right?
Why not?
Here we go.
When I did get up to speak...
I couldn't say one word.
I just stood there.
I had such a good speech, too.
It was full of funny little jokes
I made up myself.
That's nice.
I mean, that's not... That's too bad.
And then it came to my drum solo... with the high school band.
- I never could face them again.
- That's terrible.
Three oranges, please.
So my father said that
I could come to New York... for six months and take this course.
My father says if I get enough poise and confidence for New York...
I'll be a cinch for Miss Montana next year.
- Is the course working?
- Yes.
I even made up a little joke about it.
Poise meets girl.
- You got it.
- Yes, I did.
Did I get it, Dad?
Well, you might have, yeah.
- Can I have a hot dog?
- No, it's near dinnertime.
Just one?
What would your mama think if she knew you were spoiling your appetite?
Eddie, the lady asked you a question.
We ain't going home for dinner, anyway, because... my mother died, and the housekeeper has got the afternoon off.
I'm sorry you have no mother, Eddie.
But...
Well, here's a good idea... why don't you both come up to my apartment and I'll make you dinner?
Boy!
Italian spaghetti, how's that?
I like Chinese food better than anything.
- Okay, Italian spaghetti Chinese style.
- I got a better idea.
Suppose Eddie and I take you to dinner,
Miss Montana? I mean, Miss Daly.
- How about it?
- Boy, is your hair pretty.
Is it real?
Genuine, Eddie.
Everything you see here, it's me.
Gosh!
- You know something, Dad?
- What?
I think she liked us.
She liked you, Eddie, that's for sure.
No, us.
And you know something else?
I think she's lonesome.
- Even with all that red hair.
- Maybe.
Are you lonely, Dad?
Sometimes.
Why don't you come right out and ask Dollye to live with us?
There's an idea.
I bet she'd love to live with us.
I bet she would.
We could make her a sleep-in.
- No, it wouldn't work, Eddie.
- Why not?
For one thing,
Mrs. Livingston would have a fit.
See, Mrs. Livingston does not like floozies.
Floozies?
Is Dollye a floozy?
No, I don't think so.
I don't think so at all.
Then why can't she live with us?
Eddie, you don't ask a woman to live with you unless you marry her.
You could do that later.
You know, Eddie, I loved your mother very much and I still do.
I don't think I'd like to have anybody try to take her place.
Not just yet.
If you can't marry her, maybe we can find somebody who can.
I don't think she wants a husband. I think she just wants somebody to help her.
Maybe we could get somebody to help her.
I'll think about it.
So mark that down in your appointment books.
At the grand ballroom on the 12th... and I'm sure none of you lovely things out there will want to miss this.
The biggest fashion event of the year.
And, I think you ought to add, Mr. Jones... that all the proceeds go to charity.
Did you hear it, ladies and gentlemen?
That lovely voice... belongs to Rita Behrens... fashion consultant for this event and any other event.
If you could be sitting here as I am facing this charming, this alluring... the earth's noblest thing... a woman perfected.
And who was it that said:
"Her eyes shall remain as dew drops on the petals of my memory"?
Miss Behrens, we ought to get together, go over the ground plans for this event.
How about Friday night?
Yes.
I'm sure the committee would be happy to meet with you.
The committee. Yes, well, that isn't... exactly what I had in mind, but you can't say Jones doesn't try.
We'll talk about it later.
But first, a lovely ballad... for a lovely lady.
Be right back, honey. Don't go away.
Greetings, Captain.
What's this frantic note I got...
- you wanted to see me?
- That can wait.
You gotta stop making dates on the air.
It's illegal?
- The FCC can...
- The FCC?
- Yes.
- Are you sick?
You're sick.
You ought to form an organization like AA.
"Womanics anonymous."
- Look, I'm just trying...
- You're trying to get thee to a monastery.
I'm not ready yet.
I'm not gonna give up my life as I know it.
- Keep your life off the air, will you?
- All right!
Want me to leave the girls alone?
I'll leave the girls alone.
- All right.
- Now what did you want to see me about?
I wanted to ask a favor of you.
- Mr. Corbett?
- Yes?
Your appointment's here, sir.
- Where is she?
- She's in your office.
- Would you bring her down here?
- Yes, sir.
Norm... there's somebody I'd like you to meet.
- I mean, interview.
- Who is he?
It's a woman.
Whistler's mother? Queen Victoria?
It just so happens that this is a very fine young girl.
Why, Captain, is it possible you're human after all?
Quit clowning, will you? I thought you might fit her into one of your programs.
Put her on tape, and listen to her.
Kind of give her advice, sort of... build her up.
- Build her up?
- Yeah.
You see, what she needs is self-confidence.
And she has this funny complex that she has no poise.
Why, you sly old fox.
Where'd you meet her?
I met her at...
- I met her through a friend of mine.
- What's her name?
Dollye Daly.
Dollye Daly?
I like that.
It's sort of like dilly-dally.
It just so happens that Daly is a very respectable name... in the state of Montana, and Dollye is a very respectable young girl... and she's a very unassuming girl and she's very sweet...
- and she's very simple.
- Why, of course.
You know me.
Anything for the boss.
Come in, Dilly...
Miss Daly, this is Norman Jones...
And this.
Don't tell me, this is Dollye Daly.
Why, yes.
Not one of the Montana Dalys?
Not one of the real ones.
Not related to old Marcus Daly.
See, she...
And how old is old Marcus now?
He's dead.
He died in 1863.
Sorry to hear that.
I was just telling Norm that he might...
And I'd be delighted to help,
Miss Daly. Delighted.
Why, we think the world of old Tom around here, and any friend of Tom's is...
Tell you what. We'll all get together
Friday night and kick it around.
Couldn't we...
We'll talk it over. I'm expecting to take out Miss Rita Behrens.
- We'll all go together.
- Friday?
I'm sorry. That's my night for bowling.
Bowling. Good, swell!
That's my game, bowling.
Keeps those old muscles in shape, huh, Tom?
It's all settled then. Friday. See you then.
Norm...
Bowling?
How's about for Friday night?
I'm busy.
Who's that?
You mean the girl with the...
The red hair?
No, I mean the man with the interesting smile.
Program Manager. He runs the joint.
He does have a look about him.
That happens to be the look of a fresh widower... and we could've been double-dating with him Friday night.
- Dad?
- Eddie.
- I thought you'd be asleep by now.
- I feel real terrible, Dad.
I'm shivering and my teeth are hitting each other.
Come here.
You stay here and keep the covers over you and keep warm, all right?
Hot, I'm hot.
I'll be right back.
- Who is it?
- It's Tom Corbett.
I'm sorry, Elizabeth.
I hate to bother you, but it's Eddie.
He's sick.
I think he's real sick.
I don't know whether I should...
Any vomiting?
- No.
- Diarrhea?
I don't think so.
- Do you have a thermometer?
- Yes.
Eddie, turn over on your tummy.
That's it.
Don't worry, I won't hurt you.
Here.
What else can I...
Can I boil some water or something?
Tom, he's not gonna have a baby.
Get me some rubbing alcohol, please.
Now?
No, go to bed, and stop worrying.
- Here.
- Over there.
Tom, go to bed. Please.
- Elizabeth?
- Yes, Eddie?
You don't have your uniform on.
We'll try and get you well without it.
Good morning.
Good morning.
I thought you might need a little refueling.
I'd love some.
Sleep well?
Yes, I am very ashamed to say I did, thanks to you.
How's the patient?
A touch of flu, 24-hour variety.
He'll bounce back fast.
Good.
You know, he's quite a boy, that Eddie.
- He let me in on a great medical secret.
- What was that?
He told me that brave boys don't bleed much when they're hurt.
No matter how big the cut is they hold their blood in.
Elizabeth, I don't know how to thank you for everything, really.
There's nothing to thank me for.
I enjoyed taking care of him.
I want to pay you something.
After all, you... stayed here all night.
You lost a whole night's sleep.
Here, have some more coffee.
I have known Eddie... ever since he was born.
- I know, Elizabeth.
- I'm supposed to be his friend.
- Yes, I know that.
- When a friend of mine needs me...
I've been known to help without expecting to be paid.
All right, so I made a mistake.
I was just trying to show my gratitude...
And keep everything as impersonal as possible?
So much an hour, is that the idea?
Look, you don't have to get so touchy when...
Touchy? I'm touchy?
You couldn't for a moment be in my debt.
Oh, no!
You think every woman that walks in that door wants to make it a permanent visit.
All right, so you did me a favor, thank you.
- Thank you very much.
- Not on your life.
Even the volunteer services of a volunteer nurse are worth something.
You'll have my bill by this evening.
Good morning.
Good morning.
- Dad?
- Well, now.
Why don't you like Elizabeth?
How we doing, Eddie-o?
You were talking loud out there.
I'm sorry.
Is there something about her looks you don't like?
No.
I think she looks swell.
It couldn't be her eyes.
Her eyes?
They're not all skinny.
You know, like those ladies in the comic books who are no good.
They always got skinny eyes.
Skinny eyes.
Anything else?
There's one other thing, but... it's about sex.
Go ahead. I can stand it.
The bad ladies... they always got big busts.
Now, don't get mad, Dad, but it's true.
Very big... skinny eyes, and big busts... is how you tell a bad lady from a good one.
Aren't there any good ladies in that stuff you read?
Sure... but they always got medium-size busts... and round eyes, of course.
I'll keep that in mind.
No matter how I feel about Elizabeth...
I'm very glad you've been in the hands of a round-eyed girl.
Mommy.
She had round eyes.
Yes, I know.
I can still remember... that day they took her to the hospital.
I guess I better not talk about it.
No.
No, go ahead if you want to.
Remember, Dad?
They brought that bed with the wheels in here... and they put her on it.
She was smiling, but she didn't look so good.
And you know what she said to me?
What did she say, Eddie?
She called me over to her.
And she told me to be a good boy and to take care of you.
Did you know that, Dad?
No.
I never told nobody before.
Then they wheeled her out in the hall.
I didn't think that bed could get in the elevator... but it did.
Do you think Mommy knew she wasn't coming back?
I don't know.
Where is she, Dad... right now?
Eddie, she's right smack dab in the middle of heaven.
Do you think she remembers me?
I'm sure she does.
Bravo!
How do we stand?
Now, let's see, that makes 200 for me.
And what am I? Still... nothing?
Mr. Jones... are you sure bowling is your game?
We athletes all have our off nights, you know.
You can't pitch a no-hit game every time.
Must be that old Army wound of mine acting up.
Would you mind, Mr. Jones, if I... show you what I think you're doing wrong?
You just go right ahead and show me.
All right, stand behind this line.
Behind the line. Right. I got it.
- That's it.
- There we are.
Now, don't take such a big swing.
Just easy.
Easy. I see.
All right, now move straight forward.
- Forward.
- From the hips.
From the hips.
See where my hips are?
I do.
Move like that.
And, don't let your body get out of control.
Right.
- Watch me and do everything I do.
- Okay.
That's it.
I'll be darned.
What does a fashion consultant do?
You might say that she forces her own peculiar tastes... upon woman who have absolutely none at all.
Sounds like a racket for snobs... but there's really a lot of hard work involved.
The efficient... self-possessed American career woman.
No, never. I've seen too many
Rosalind Russell pictures for that.
No, I'm going to marry him... just as soon as he asks me.
Who's he?
The man who'll love me on equal terms.
That old saying,
"behind every man there's a woman."
That's not for me.
I want to stand right alongside.
Is that asking too much?
I'm afraid you're gonna have to be satisfied with the vote right now.
I don't think that that'll ever become a national movement.
You have rules?
There are eight rules in the course all together.
The eight golden rules to poise and self-confidence.
What's number two?
Number two: Stand straight... hold your head high, and breathe deeply.
I like that.
Number two.
Number three: Show your enthusiasm.
By all means.
And number four: Give yourself to others.
- There! l...
- They're insecure, too.
- Number five...
- lf you'll pardon my saying so...
I think the guy that wrote these rules ought to be arrested.
It's not a man.
It's a woman.
The Henrietta Rockefeller
Poise and Confidence School.
I know. I don't think that's her real name, either.
Rockefeller.
I just think she took that name... to make people feel more confident.
Oh, yeah. That'll do it every time.
Norm, did you ever get that 1924 pressing... of the Wolverines playing the Jazz Me Blues that I sent you?
What do you mean did I get it?
I played it on the air. I interviewed you.
Yeah. What an arrangement.
- That's my bowling ball.
- Yeah, that's her bowling ball.
Ricky, we don't get together nearly enough.
Why don't you drop up to the program some time?
Any morning at all, buddy.
Always glad to see you.
You just don't know how I envy you, Mr. Jones.
Your self-composure... your command, your sangfroid.
Well, you just don't ever seem to suffer from feeling inadequate.
That's only a front. Don't you see?
Deep down inside
I'm just as inadequate as anyone else.
But you gotta have that front, kid.
You gotta fake it.
You can do it. You're very smart.
That's not my problem, Mr. Jones.
I had the highest scholastic average... of all the girls who competed for Miss Montana.
But when I got up in front of all those people to recite...
- and play my drum solo...
- That's just what I mean.
Fake it. That's rule number one with me, boy.
Fake it up. Doesn't make any difference what you do.
Singing, dancing... glass-blowing. You like to recite?
Get up and recite. So you bomb out.
Nobody's gonna kill you.
The point is to get in there and fake it.
That's all right for you to say.
You're so good at everything.
Yeah, like bowling.
You got a lot to give, kid.
Get up and give it.
Anything.
- What was that other thing?
- My drum solo.
Yeah.
Well, even that.
Look, we might as well start right now.
- Start what?
- Come on with me, right through here.
It's all right.
John, my friend would like to sit in on the drums.
- Mr. Jones, please.
- It's all right.
- How about it?
- She's got it, man.
- Come on.
- Mr. Jones, really I can't.
Come on with me, right through here.
How about it, Jack?
- I was just leaving.
- There we are.
- Move right in and sit down.
- What's the scene, Miss?
He means what number would you like to play?
Do you know the Carnival of Venice?
It's our trademark.
- Do you know Carnival of Venice?
- Like the inside of my hand.
- Mr. Jones...
- Don't forget. Henrietta Rockefeller.
So?
Well, so that's about it.
Things get a little difficult sometimes.
But I have Eddie.
What's more important, Eddie has you.
Yes. Me and just about everybody else in the building.
He runs in and out of those apartments just like he owns them.
Of course, they all know he's polite and says "thank you" and everything.
You know, sometimes he forgets to zip himself up.
Well...
Does he act that way around all your friends?
Well, it depends what they have in mind.
I see. Well, then.
Say, I gotta get going.
I really should.
I mean, the housekeeper's sitting up with Eddie...
- and I don't want to worry her.
- Of course.
Hello. Hello, Ronnie.
No, I was out this evening.
Well, why don't you... call me back in the morning?
Yes. What?
Christmas?
Well, hold the line a minute.
Are you doing anything for Christmas?
Christmas, I'm taking Eddie up to my brother's place in Connecticut.
- A little family atmosphere.
- I understand.
Ronnie, I think I can make it for Christmas.
Well, why don't you call me back in the morning?
Hold the line a minute, will you?
What about New Year's?
- New Year's?
- I'm having a party. You're invited.
I accept.
Ronnie, I'll talk to you in the morning.
Well...
I'm sorry.
It's funny. My taking you to dinner.
It's like I'm going out on a first date.
Did you kiss her good night?
Twice.
- ¡Arriba!
- ¡Olé!
¡Arriba!
Gotta listen.
- Olé!
- Olé!
You missed it!
Well, that does it.
If I don't get out of here now,
I'll never get home tonight.
Say, honey... could you stay with Eddie for a while?
- Well, l...
- Please.
- Sure, I'd be glad to.
- Good.
Mr. Corbett will be home any minute.
And, Eddie, you go to bed.
- Adiós.
- Adiós.
Elizabeth?
Can't I just stay up until Dad gets here?
I want to ask him something.
What?
How he made out with his date.
Eddie... are you... anxious for your father to get married?
Sure. It'll make him happy again.
You realize, of course... that his wife would be your stepmother, and not just a housekeeper.
I know, that part ain't so hot.
A stepmother.
She'd make me go to bed early.
And she'd say, "My, aren't we dirty?"
When she means, "You're dirty."
Me, I mean.
You often are.
She won't let me run through the rooms.
She'll keep the lid down in the bathroom.
When I'm racing up from the playground...
I don't hardly make it in time when the lid's down.
Those aren't the best reasons
I've ever heard, Eddie.
I got a great idea!
If Dad got married, would he have to tell anybody?
- Why would you want to keep it a secret?
- Well... he could get married, and we could pretend... that she took the place of Mrs. Livingston.
And I'd be real nice to her, and polite.
Dad could have discussions with her.
Get a baby, and go to the movies, and all that.
But we could tell everybody that she's our new housekeeper.
See, then I wouldn't have a stepmother.
Eddie, do you really think any woman would go for that?
- Would you?
- No.
Why not? It wouldn't be so hard.
Except for maybe the baby part.
How do you get babies anyway?
Well...
Saved in the nick of time.
Saved from what?
Babies and stepmothers.
We were just getting down to the basic facts.
He's all yours.
How'd you make out, Dad?
Never mind how I made out.
- You should be in bed, Eddie.
- And so should I.
- Tom.
- Yes.
Be honest. Be frank.
All the books say so. Good night.
- Good...
- Good night, Eddie.
Good night, Elizabeth.
What was that all about?
Well, I just asked how you got babies.
I think it's a little late for that.
Let's go.
- 'Night, Dad.
- Good night, Eddie-o.
It was William the Conqueror.
He ordered that new years start on January 1.
The Egyptians had it in September.
Dollye, you never cease to amaze me.
I don't want to brag.
But I did have a very high scholastic average.
And yet... every time I got up to say my piece or speak...
Oh, dear.
Do you know many pieces?
I have loads of them.
Even one for New Year's.
- You do?
- It's just beautiful. It's called...
The Death of the Old Year.
"Full knee-deep
"lies the winter snow
"And the winter winds are wearily sighing
"Toll ye the church bell sad and slow
"And tread softly
"and speak low
"for the old year
"lies a-dying."
It's a little grim, don't you think?
Rita, do you think Norman likes me?
Well, he... he seems to.
I don't know what's wrong.
He does seem to, but... he's never even kissed me good night.
Is there something about me that...
Hello?
This is Corbett Catering.
You said Champagne, caviar, and something else.
What was that something else?
That something else was anchovies.
And don't you dare come without them.
Anchovies, right. Anchovies it will be.
And we will be there in about one half of an hour. All right?
- Dad?
- Yeah.
What do the numbers mean after a lady's name?
Eddie, I am so busy right now, l...
It says here, "40-18-35."
Holy smoke. Who's that?
Jayne Mans...
F, I...
E, L, D.
Yeah.
What do the numbers mean? Did she win?
- Did she beat somebody?
- She probably could if she wanted to.
I lost my cuff link around here somewhere.
Do you mind looking for it?
- Sure.
- Maybe it's under the bed there.
What do the numbers mean?
They're inches. 40's the bust.
What's the other two numbers?
It's the waist and the hips.
Suppose the first one, the bust was 20, what would happen?
Absolutely nothing. Poor girl.
This lady you're going out with, what does she measure?
What are you smiling for?
I was just thinking of something.
What's your favorite inches on a lady, Dad?
I'd say 36.
Come on now. Use your head, Eddie.
If it was...
36-36-36, she'd be straight up and down, wouldn't she?
How many inches should she dent in?
I never counted. I mean, you just...
You make a woman sound like a dented fender or something.
Thank you.
- Will you let me know, Dad?
- What?
About the lady's inches tonight.
I'd be very interested.
I don't walk around carrying a tape measure, Eddie.
We got one in the house. Wait a minute.
- Never mind. I'll guess.
- Tape measure, for what?
For the lady.
Never mind, Mrs. Livingston. It's all right.
- You have a good time.
- Thank you.
- You'll let me know in the morning?
- Absolutely not.
You grow up and get your own girl.
- Dad.
- Look, I'm very late.
Happy New Year, Dad.
Happy New Year, Eddie.
Happy New Year!
"And tho' his foes speak ill of him,
He was a friend to me
"Old year, you shall not die
"We did so laugh and cry with you
"I've half a mind to die with you,
Old year, if you must die
"Old year, if you must..."
It was the wrong X-ray.
That's so funny.
Well, good night, Elizabeth.
- Good night, Charlie.
- And thanks again.
Well, sounds like you had a pretty good time.
Yes.
We had a lovely time.
It was a million laughs.
Would you like a small sample of tonight's humor?
Yes. What?
At the nightclub, the maître d' asked us if we'd like to sit down front.
Right, well?
Charlie to maître d':
- "I'm sorry, sir, we don't bend that way."
- Oh, no.
All evening?
No.
The rest of the evening was taken up with... the notochord, the ectoderm, the esoderm, and the mesoderm.
He specializes in rare diseases of the bone.
What fun.
You wouldn't think so, if you had to listen to bone jokes all night.
And I think I intend to drink myself to sleep.
Can I help?
I mean, I have some pretty good brandy in there.
- I'd love some.
- Come on.
El del segundo tiene un dormitorio... sala y comedor.
¿Da también al patio?
No. Da a la calle.
¿Cuánto es el alquiler?
El alquiler del más grande... es de 5,000 pesetas al año.
Además del agua...
- That's her Spanish lesson.
- I know, she told me.
Tom, it's very...
I'm glad I didn't go back to my room.
'Cause I'd only cry...
- and I don't want to.
- Come on now. It wasn't that bad.
No, it's just New Year's Eve.
I'm glad I don't get this way very often.
How long has it been since the divorce?
A year. It wasn't so bad.
It was the same old story, I guess.
We were very young...
- no fatal damage.
- Yeah, but a few scars.
I'm still young. They'll heal.
I take it that the bone doctor is not in the running.
He is very fond of my...
- pectoral girdle.
- Good for him.
That's very good, you know,
'cause I've been...
I've been quite fond of it myself for quite some time.
Happy New Year, Tom.
A happier New Year.
For both of us.
Table 23.
- Good afternoon, Miss Behrens.
- Edmund, has Mr. Corbett arrived yet?
Eddie.
- I hope I haven't kept you waiting.
- No, of course not.
Eddie, I'd like you to meet Miss Behrens.
This is Eddie.
How do you do?
I'm so glad to meet you.
I've heard a lot about you.
He's a charming child.
Thank you.
What lovely manners.
I won't pretend that he hasn't been coached a bit.
- Donald.
- Yes, Miss Behrens.
Thank you.
This is a very special occasion, our first meeting.
Yes, ma'am.
Yes, we were just talking about Eddie.
He's gonna have a birthday. And... we're gonna have a party.
How wonderful.
You know... every time the year goes by we always have a party for Eddie.
Every year, Eddie has... a birthday party.
And the house just gets jammed with kids.
Doesn't it, Eddie?
Yes, it certainly does get crowded.
- Was that your foot, Dad?
- I'm sorry, Eddie.
But Eddie likes it that way, so... why not? Eddie?
Eddie?
It's going to be bigger than ever.
Mrs. Livingston is going to bake a big cake.
Elizabeth said she'd bring the candy and help out like.
Elizabeth?
- Yes, that's our next-door neighbor.
- I see.
May I come to your party, Eddie?
- Well...
- I'd like to help out, too.
Okay, if you want to.
Thank you very much.
Excuse me.
- Pardon us a minute, will you, please?
- Of course.
It's right up those steps there to the left.
Eddie, what's the matter with you?
Nothing.
I don't like the way you're behaving.
When you come back, will you please try to smile...
- and act like you're enjoying yourself?
- Sure, Dad.
I'll try.
Good boy.
He's just wonderful, Tom.
- He's delightful.
- I have known him to give... warmer receptions to people, I'm afraid.
After all, I have taken you away from him for... several evenings now.
He's probably just a little jealous.
I suppose so.
We're going to get along just fine.
- Do I fly?
- No, you swing.
All right, kids.
Come and get your signs on.
You go get Katie and Tommy, and bring them back here.
Come on, kids!
Get your sign on. Come on.
All right. Here we go.
You all have to be animals.
See, the idea is we never let it go any faster.
Jane, you never point a gun at anybody, ever.
Kelly, out of the fish.
We don't play with the fish, Kelly.
- You sit right there, Kelly.
- Mr. Corbett!
- What is it?
- Do I quack?
- Do you what?
- Do I quack?
Let's see.
No, you don't have the nose for...
See what happened when you made it...
I told you to stay out of the fish. Mike...
- is this your brother?
- Yes.
Will you please take care of him?
Melissa, she saw a monster!
- Where?
- In Eddie's room, under the table.
Under the table. It's all right.
And your front legs are shorter than your back!
Hello!
I'm sorry, I can't hear!
I'm sorry, it's difficult to hear. What?
This is Elizabeth Marten.
Elizabeth?
Yes, Tom's mentioned you.
This is Rita Behrens.
I wonder, could I speak to Tom, please?
Miss Behrens.
Yes, of course. Hold on a minute.
Tom!
You're wanted on the phone.
- Who is it?
- Miss Behrens.
Right.
Hello?
Listen, it's very noisy here.
Where are you?
At home. You'll never guess what's happened.
It's Norm and Dollye. They're engaged.
- They're actually engaged.
- Is that Tom?
Yes.
I was just leaving for the party when they arrived with the news.
It can't be that noisy here.
I don't think I heard you right.
- Really, Tom. They...
- Here, let me.
Hail, Cupid, and come on over.
Sure we are. Right here next month.
Then off to Montana for the honeymoon.
If you can't make it now, how about tonight?
I was supposed to take Eddie to a birthday dinner tonight, but...
- Let me handle him.
- Don't let us down, buddy.
But I can't foul up an engagement party.
Especially when I'm responsible for it.
Look, I'll tell you what.
I'll be there, I'll pick you up.
Right.
- Mrs. Livingston...
- I'm busy.
- I mean, it's just for tonight...
- I'm busy.
Come on, little Indian.
Dad...
Richard found out he was a zebra by looking in the bathroom mirror.
- Does it count?
- No. Absolutely not.
Elizabeth, what's eating Mrs. Livingston?
Are the kids getting her down or what is it?
- Seems all right to me.
- Almost bit my head off.
All I said was,
"Would you help me out tonight?"
- Tonight?
- I had to take Eddie to dinner.
Something came up.
- I can't make it.
- I see.
- I was just thinking maybe you could...
- I'm busy.
All you'd have to do is...
I'm busy.
Elizabeth, somebody said I bite.
Could you give me a big hint?
It takes one to know one. Ask him.
Somebody said I bite.
Could you give me a big hint?
Let's take a look.
'Bye, I'm glad you could come.
Dad, they're gone now. Everyone.
I'll never be the same, Eddie.
You were cool, Dad. All the kids said so.
Boy, I had a wonderful birthday.
That's good. That's real good.
- Everyone came. Everyone I invited.
- They sure did, didn't they?
The house was nice and noisy for a change, wasn't it?
For a change, it was.
It'll be so quiet tonight.
I'm glad we're going out for dinner.
Eddie...
I'm glad, too. Happy Birthday, Eddie.
- Can Elizabeth come?
- Nope. You, me, us.
Elizabeth, she's busy.
Okay. Everybody, hold it.
Where am I?
We wish you every happiness, my dear.
Congratulations, my boy.
Thank you.
Congratulations.
You were the most lovely bride.
Dollye?
You know, you'll never be
Miss Montana now.
I don't have to be anymore.
- That's rule eight.
- Eight?
Fall in love, and love will make you brave.
Eddie!
Eddie, my very first boyfriend.
I brought you something.
You did?
- Open it.
- For me?
What is it?
Isn't that nice?
I thought you'd like it now for your husband.
It's swell, Eddie. It's just beautiful.
Shall I put it on now?
Why not?
The very first piece of cake goes to Eddie.
- Thank you.
- And thank you, darling.
And thank you, Mr. Corbett.
Thanks for everything.
Wait a minute. Hold it.
Congratulations!
- How's the cake?
- I don't want any.
I think I'm sick.
Sick?
Yes.
Let's go home, Dad.
Look, we planned to have dinner with Rita in Central Park.
I don't feel good.
All right, now. Let's have it out right now.
What is there that bothers you about Rita?
Now, so help me, if you say she's got skinny eyes, I'll clobber you.
- But she has, Dad!
- I don't care if she's got polka-dot eyes!
There's no reason not to like her.
- I'm trying.
- Stop trying and just like her.
You understand?
Is something wrong with Eddie?
I'm afraid he's not feeling very well, Rita.
What a shame. I'm sorry.
You know how it is with kids.
These things come on real quickly.
But I'm afraid that we're gonna have to cancel our dinner date.
Yes, you'd better if he's not feeling well.
Yes. I really ought to take him home right now.
You understand, though, don't you?
Of course. I understand.
Rita!
How about that?
The new bride and groom.
Shall you meet us in Montana or wait for us here?
How about that, Captain? You're next.
Does he have to take all this?
I thought we had to stick...
- to the list the camp sent us here.
- Exactly what we have, Mr. Corbett.
It says seven blouses or seven shirts.
No. He can't take these.
- Get rid of these once and for all.
- Mr. Corbett, without those... you know good and well he couldn't walk.
It says seven socks here. Let me see.
Una, dos, tres, cuatro...
I'm going. Did you fix it?
Did I fix it? I certainly did.
There. What do you think?
Boy, is that neato.
How'd you sew it on there?
It wasn't too difficult.
- Can I put it on now?
- Sure.
There.
They're gonna think you're one of the counselors.
It's great.
Like I'm really out of school now.
You told me you liked school.
At the beginning is all.
They're nice at the beginning...
'cause they don't want you to hate school right off.
But after Christmas they don't care anymore.
They let you hate it.
Will you visit camp with Dad?
Maybe. We'll see about that.
Now that I'm gone... maybe you can have discussions with Dad.
You know, long ones?
Like Mom and Dad did... when they'd shut the bedroom door.
We'll see about that, too.
Eddie-o!
Coming, Dad!
Goodbye, Elizabeth.
Goodbye, Eddie. Have a good time.
Eddie! The bus is here!
Don't forget your fish, Eddie!
- Here you are.
- Thanks, Mrs. Livingston.
- Take care.
- ¡Adiós, Muchacho!
¡Adiós!
Have a good time!
'Bye!
That boy sure is crazy about you, isn't he?
I'm pretty crazy about him, too.
It's a shame you and Mr. Corbett... get on each other's nerves so much.
Mr. Corbett doesn't get on my nerves.
We get along just fine.
I don't know where you got that idea.
I mean, we might have our little differences now and then...
Don't wait too long, honey.
What?
I got a feeling that man's on the verge.
Mr. Corbett is free to verge whichever way he wants to.
Okay, honey... but don't say I didn't tell you.
And it won't be long, either.
Play ball!
I think Eddie's up to bat.
Why don't you go on ahead?
- Hi, Dad!
- Hi, Eddie!
- Eddie!
- Get the ball, Tony.
Tony!
- Safe!
- It's a home run!
That was terrific.
He's gonna be a champ, isn't he?
Let's see now.
We can check off the volleyball... and the water polo and the relay races.
You don't mind missing the girls' archery, Dad?
No. I'm sure Rita will give us a full report on that.
Hi, Mike.
This is Mike, my roommate.
- Hi, Mike.
- Hi.
This is where I sleep.
All right.
- Dad?
- Yeah?
There's something I have to tell you.
What is it, Eddie-o?
It's serious.
You aren't looking at me.
I'm sorry, Eddie.
All right.
I was going to write you about it... but they censor the mail.
- Do you know what that means?
- Yes, I do.
All right. I'm serious. I'm looking at you.
I'm sure we can take care of whatever trouble it might be.
I'm sure we can do something about it, Eddie.
There ain't nothing we can do, Dad.
Suppose you let me be the judge of that.
What seems to be the trouble?
Promise you won't tell anyone, not anyone?
No, not a soul. This is just between you and me, all right?
Dad, for the first time in my life... my whole life, I'm...
I'm in love.
That's very serious, Eddie.
And she loves me, Dad.
That's good. I'm glad of that.
Her name's Cherry.
Cherry? You know, that's a very pretty name.
But her real name's Cheryl Candace.
Cherry for short.
You know what you oughta do?
You oughta call her Cherry Candy.
- Don't kid me, Dad.
- I'm sorry.
Is she real pretty?
She's beautiful.
Except from behind.
Behind?
Girls aren't so pretty from behind, Dad.
You must like her an awful lot, Eddie.
I do. I ain't kidding around, Dad.
I'd like to give her a present.
You would? That's very nice.
What would you like to give her?
Money.
Money?
I'd like to give her money.
- Why don't you just give her a book, or...
- She can't read good... and I like to give her the things she likes best.
And she likes money the best.
She loves money.
She thinks money's terrific, honest.
Look, I'm very sorry, Eddie, but money is out.
I mean, why don't you give her... something of yours?
Something you like very much.
Women like that, Eddie.
- It pleases them.
- My old sneakers.
- Eddie, you're not listening to me at all...
- But, Dad, Cherry loves my old sneakers.
She won the "Junior Red Cross lifesaving...
"getting undressed underwater" contest with them on.
She borrowed them from me.
Eddie, that's a perfect gift.
There's one thing, Dad.
Okay. What's that?
Cherry's a little bit fat.
But that's not important.
Of course, it's not important at all.
Some of the kids call her "fatso"...
- but I would never call her fatso.
- I'm very glad, Eddie.
That's us. Here we go.
Here we go again. Let's see now.
Come on, Eddie.
That's 3:45. That's the wood-burning demonstration, I believe.
Dad?
I'm sorry. What is it?
When you meet Cherry... don't look surprised, okay?
I wouldn't want to hurt her feelings.
Eddie. You're a prince.
Now, I've made a list here and I'd appreciate it if you would...
He's gonna be a great ball player if he gets more control... over where that ball goes.
- Thanks again.
- You're welcome. Thanks.
- Thank you so much.
- Goodbye.
I wouldn't have missed this for the world.
I guess you really like baseball a lot.
I like it, I guess.
Like it? It's his whole life!
Your little friend. What's her name?
Cherry, she must like to watch you play.
Look, I didn't say a word, son.
- Did I say something?
- No, it's...
Listen, I'll be along in a minute.
Goodbye, Eddie. I had a wonderful time.
You told her.
I did not tell her.
Then how did she know?
Eddie, you were practically standing on your head all afternoon... for this little girl.
Now, why shouldn't she know?
You mean, Rita guessed?
That's exactly what I mean.
Is she a fortune teller or something?
Listen, I don't like Rita, Dad.
She butts in.
Don't you like Elizabeth?
What if you marry Rita, and she knows everything?
All right, now let's get this one thing straight.
You're a boy, and I'm a man.
When you grow up, you'll live your life.
I live my life.
That's what a man's supposed to do.
I'm gonna tell you something, Eddie.
I'm gonna ask Rita to marry me.
That's the way it is, Eddie.
Try to understand.
Hi, Eddie! Your father's nice.
- I like him...
- Shut up.
- Care for a brandy?
- Right.
I'll get it.
Oh, dear.
What's the matter?
I look overdanced, overtired, overfed, over-hiked... through summer camp.
In short, I'm deliciously exhausted.
Good. Then I'll take advantage of your weakened condition... and come right out with it now.
Sounds ominous. Out with what?
You care to sit down?
Aren't I? Right.
Fire one.
It's only one... and I don't think you're gonna be very surprised.
Shall I get down on one knee?
What's the matter? Have I botched it up?
Have I picked the wrong time, the wrong place?
No, Tom, of course not. It's just that...
I think there are things that we should discuss.
Something that ought to be cleared up between us if we...
Go ahead.
Tom, I've always been a realist.
For better or worse I've always tried to say exactly what I think.
There's nothing wrong with that.
Then surely you must realize, darling, that...
Eddie isn't exactly going to welcome me with open arms.
Eddie?
You were the one who said that a little bit of jealousy is perfectly normal.
You just gotta give him time, that's all.
He's had time. He's had plenty of time.
And it hasn't done much good.
But he's only a child.
I mean, surely you and I can look at this thing in a mature way?
Exactly.
That's just what I'm trying to do.
If there was some way... that Eddie could go and spend a few months... with your brother's family, just at first...
Send...
Eddie... away?
Not forever, darling.
Just to give us a chance to get our life started together.
That's all I'm asking.
Can you think of anything else?
Eddie's not going to change suddenly... just because we're married.
It would seem that...
Eddie isn't our only problem.
Darling, we must face this now.
I know.
Hello.
Who's calling? Just a minute.
Tom, it's the switchboard operator at your apartment. Are you here?
Mr. Corbett, I found you!
I've been trying for three hours.
That summer camp, they've called here twice.
They don't want to alarm you, but it seems Eddie is missing.
- They sent out searching parties...
- When was this?
Have they notified...
Call the camp. Tell them I'm leaving now.
I'll be there in a couple of hours.
- Tom, what is it?
- It's Eddie.
- What about Eddie? What happened?
- He's gone.
We have three cars out now.
We'll hear from them any minute.
They got a helicopter with a loudspeaker traveling over the North Woods area.
They'll call the YMCA camp, and form two search parties now.
- Boy Scouts are searching the valley.
- And the lake area?
- We've got men there.
- We can't drag the lake until morning.
- That must be 100 feet deep.
- But Eddie can swim.
- He can swim well.
- Mr. Corbett...
- why don't we wait in the bunkhouse?
- Yes. We're doing everything.
We'll let you know.
I'm gonna go check with the State Highway Patrol.
All right, men, let's go.
- Can I get you a cup of coffee?
- No, thank you.
Hi, Mike.
Listen, would you...
- would you tell me something?
- Sure.
Did Eddie ever go into the woods alone?
I mean, did you ever see him... do anything sort of dangerous?
Look, I'm sure he wouldn't mind,
I mean, telling me.
- Anything to help me find Eddie.
- No.
You see... you're his best friend.
Maybe he'd tell you some plans... he might have had, or... some sort of secret?
You know, something he might not have told me?
He told me a secret about something else.
That wouldn't count, though.
Maybe it might.
Please, you got to help me, Mike.
You gotta tell me.
He's gonna be a clarinet player when he grows up.
Gonna practice secretly and surprise everybody.
He told me he's gonna surprise even you.
Go to sleep, Mike.
Mr. Corbett, there's a call for you.
It may be about your son.
They said it was from New York, a Miss Elizabeth Marten.
Hello?
Elizabeth?
How did you know that I...?
- Where is he?
- He's asleep.
Let's go to your place, and I'll tell you.
- How did he get here?
- Calm down.
- I don't wanna wake him up.
- What is he trying to do?
- Why did he come to you?
- He was upset.
Where are your keys?
He said you were marrying someone... and he wanted to do something about it.
So he took off.
- He hid in a truck.
- A truck?
- Please calm down, and open the door.
- That meathead kid!
Don't be too rough.
He's all right, isn't that the main thing right now?
He got off in Manhattan, and the police picked him up...
The police?
They brought him here.
He was looking for me.
That's what I mean!
Why is he looking for you?
Don't wake him!
He's upset, and he's had a bad time!
He's had a bad time?
Do you have any idea what I've been through tonight?
- You've been through a lot, too.
- Thank you for those small crumbs!
You're not to disturb him until you calm down!
- I'm gonna do a lot more than that!
- Don't you touch him!
There now, see what you've done?
Is anything wrong?
What do you want me to do?
You want him to run loose, do anything he likes... just so he crawls back to rest in your comforting arms?
That's a terrible thing to say.
If he's gonna come back, let him come back to me!
So you can beat him up?
Oh, yes.
Haven't you heard?
Yes, I beat him up all the time.
It's criminal, what I do to that child.
I string him up by the thumbs...
I put bamboo sticks underneath his fingernails.
It's terrible what I do.
I'm an offense to humanity!
Hello?
Rita, listen, I got there.
It was quite late and the whole thing became sort of involved.
Can I call you back?
All right, go ahead and say it.
My consort in criminal offense.
I never mentioned the woman.
Why, you and Eddie must have had quite a conversation.
It's a wonder there are any pieces of Rita left to pick up.
I don't have to stand for this, from you or anybody!
Look, as a matter of record... she has not done one single thing to make this boy dislike her!
All this nonsense about skinny eyes...
Her what?
Not one single thing, and you make her out to be some character out of Dracula.
I couldn't care less about her.
It's Eddie that I'm worried about!
Would you please let me think about Eddie for a change?
He is my son, isn't he?
Everybody knocking him and bouncing him back and forth to get to me.
- To get to me, yes!
- To get to...
That is, without a doubt, the most egotistical, sickening...
The irresistible Don Juan, lines of women climbing over children... to swoon at your feet!
No trick too devious, no child too small...
I can see how your marriage had to fail.
If you think I'm gonna fall apart and say I'm sorry... you're out of luck.
All right, I deserved it. I'm a louse.
Look, what is there about you that I always...
You told me one time that any woman who walked in that door...
I was afraid might want to make it a permanent visit.
Well, you were right.
You see, I always was... afraid of getting involved.
Afraid of perhaps being a little disloyal... but... haven't you been doing the same thing?
What do you mean?
In a different way, sort of, you never go out at all.
Except with bone doctors.
And you've tied yourself down to a nursing career for one year.
Why?
Isn't it because you're afraid of getting involved?
Isn't it because you're afraid of another failure?
Isn't that the truth?
It's me, I bet.
I heard you talking loud.
You want to spank me or something?
- It isn't you, Eddie.
- You mean, Dad made you cry?
He sure is a dope sometimes.
He's not a dope.
You mustn't talk that way.
Your father was very worried about you and I don't blame him.
- But I told you.
- Never mind what you told me.
What you did was wrong, Eddie, and I'm ashamed of you.
- But...
- No buts.
You think Chester would run out on Matt Dillon?
No, but Matt Dillon ain't marrying Rita!
But that's strictly your father's decision, and you have no right to interfere.
Now, I think you should go over there and tell him you're sorry.
You want him to marry Rita?
If that's what he wants to do and he loves her, yes.
All right, then.
- Eddie.
- Yes?
Take your bag.
I don't think you should come over here anymore.
At least, not for a while.
Dad?
I'm sorry.
Are you going to spank me?
No.
It was bad, what I done.
Don't you want to yell at me even?
I promise, Dad, from now on...
I'll like Rita.
You'll see. I'll like her a lot.
And I'll buy her a present and everything.
Eddie...
Eddie, do you know what you've put me through?
- Yeah.
- I wonder.
You know... you are the most important thing in the world to me, Eddie.
If anything should ever happen to you... if I didn't know where you were for a day... or a week...
I don't know what I'd do.
I guess I didn't think.
I guess you didn't.
But I won't do it again.
I won't ever leave you again, Dad.
I won't even go back to camp unless you want me to.
I'll stay right here with you.
- You better get some sleep.
- Sure.
Hello? Rita...
I was gonna call you.
What happened to Eddie?
He ran away. He's home now.
Is he all right?
Yeah, he's fine. Don't worry about him.
Good.
Then we'll meet tomorrow for lunch.
Look, you see, I... may have to take Eddie back to camp... and spend the day with him.
You see, he's very disturbed at the moment.
And I think I ought to spend more time with him.
- I see.
- You understand.
Yes, of course. I understand.
We'll make it some other time, then.
- Good night, Rita.
- Good night, Tom.
You're all set.
Everything's clean, and everything's washed up.
Like the birds, Mr. Corbett,
I'm heading south.
You've been a real jewel.
I hate to see you go.
And I hate to leave. Goodbye, sweetheart.
And I'll send you a postcard from South America.
- In Spanish?
- Sure, in Spanish.
You've forgotten something?
Your record, Instant Spanish.
- I was afraid you'd bring it up.
- What's the matter?
They live in Brazil.
Do you know what that means?
- No.
- Do you know what they speak in Brazil?
Portuguese. Now they tell me!
I can always join the Peace Corps.
Goodbye, Mr. Corbett.
I'm sorry you didn't make out with that girl.
But don't give up hope, and don't let your guard down.
And keep a look out for the floozies.
Right.
- Goodbye!
- 'Bye!
Goodbye, Mrs. Livingston.
Dad... what did she mean about not making out?
Was she talking about Rita?
Yeah, I guess so.
You only saw her once last week.
Come on, Eddie, eat your lunch.
Fact is... we're still very good friends, but...
You don't love her anymore?
Is it my fault?
Look, Eddie... when you fall in love with somebody, or you think you do... it's for a lot of different reasons.
And then, when things don't work out... there's a lot of reasons for that, too.
Dad...
I bet Elizabeth was one of the reasons.
Look, we're not gonna start playing guessing games about it.
- But we can talk about her, can't we?
- Sure.
It won't do any good.
- She won't even speak to me.
- I know. She won't speak to me, either.
How did she get that mad?
Never mind.
If you ask her for a date,
I bet she'd speak to you.
It's no use, Eddie.
- Wouldn't you like to ask her for a date?
- I would.
I would like to very much.
Let's forget about it.
Dad...
I got an idea, Dad. Let's practice.
- Practice what?
- Practice asking her for a date.
- Nope.
- lf you make it good enough, she...
- Nope.
- Please, Dad.
- I'm Elizabeth, and you be you.
- No, Eddie.
Just ask me, that's all. I'm home, see?
And I'm looking plainly out the window.
Looking how?
You know, not happy, not sad.
Just a plain face.
And I sent my cleaning lady to the movies.
It sounds like you're... kind of anxious.
No, I'm not, my darling man.
Not so fast, Eddie.
Elizabeth just wouldn't talk like that.
I talk for Elizabeth, and you talk for you.
Okay, Dad?
Okay.
What did you do today, Elizabeth?
I didn't do nothing much, my future husband.
Future husband?
What's wrong with that, if she loves you?
And she does. I can tell.
Now, let's see. Where was I?
Is there anything you want to ask me, my sugar man?
Sugar...
Yes. As a matter of fact.
I like you very much.
I like you better, my handsome man.
Would you... care to have dinner with me tonight, dear?
That's good, Dad. Calling me "dear."
That's real good.
- Would you?
- You bet, my excellent strong man!
Just call me tonight and tomorrow night and all week!
I'm overwhelmed.
And if you want to, I'll even marry you.
Just call me.
I mean her. Call her right now, Dad.
- How do I know she's home?
- She's home. I made sure.
Go on. Go ahead, Dad.
All right, I will.
It's Regent 4-8599.
Your phone's ringing!
- What?
- Your telephone!
No, it's not, Eddie.
You gotta pick it up!
It could be important!
Very important!
Hurry!
Hello?
English
On the day I was born
Said me father, said he
''I've an elegant legacy
Waiting for ye
'Tis a rhyme for your lip
And a song for your heart
To sing it whenever
The world falls apart''
Look, look
Look to the rainbow
Follow it over
The hill and stream
Look, look
Look to the rainbow
Follow the fellow
Who follows a dream
'Twas a sumptuous gift
To bequeath to a child
For the lure of that song
Keeps me head runnin' wild
'Tis a rhyme for me lip
And a song for me heart
And I sing it whenever
The world falls apart
Look, look
Look to the rainbow
Follow it over
The hill and stream
Look, look
Look to the rainbow
Follow the fellow
Who follows a dream
So I bundled me heart
And I roamed the world free
To the East with the light
To the West with the sea
And I searched all the earth
And I scanned all the skies
But I found it at last
In my own true love's eyes
Look, look
Look to the rainbow
Follow it over
The hill and stream
Look, look
Look to the rainbow
Follow the fellow
Who follows a dream
Follow the fellow
Follow the fellow
Follow the fellow
Who follows a dream
Eureka!
-Sharon, come quickly.
-What is it now, Father?
We're here. lt's journey's end.
Our destination at last.
Thank heaven. Now l can sit down.
No, you can't sit you down. lt's the hill beyond yon hill. l've been hearing about the hill beyond yon hill ever since we left Ireland.
Keep your distance. Don't crowd around.
Clear the way.
-Step aside.
-What's going on here?
-They're gonna have an auction.
-A what?
They're gonna have it today.
You gonna get this auction started now or ain't you?
Hear ye! Hear ye!
Now, wait a minute!
You can't have an auction without first talking to Susan Mahoney.
-Why not?
-Henry, go get Susan.
Because her brother owns this property, that's why not.
I beg your pardon.
The law states this property belongs to anybody who can pay the back taxes.
-And that's me.
-You mean, Senator Rawkins has it.
-You're just his stooge.
-And Woody don't like stooges.
-Who's Woody?
-He's Susan's brother.
He's nothing but a troublemaking con man.
He is not. Woody's president...
...and general sales manager of the
Rainbow Valley Tobacco Cooperative.
Incorporated.
-What's that?
-Us!
-They're sharecroppers.
-Sure are.
That's how we'll all get rich together.
Woody promised me personally.
-Susan's trying to tell you something.
-I'm listening.
-What she say, Henry?
-She says Woody's coming.
-Woody.
-Woody?
-l didn't hear her say anything.
-Naturally, she was born silent.
One of the few women ever was.
Sure, mister. She don't do ''talk'' talk.
She does foot talk.
Foot talk? That's ridiculous.
-What's she saying now?
-She says you gotta wait for Woody.
He's bringing the money.
Quiet!
-Tax sale gonna start now.
-lt's all right. Woody's coming.
Woody's coming.
Woody's coming. Woody's coming.
Woody's coming.
It's my duty to protect the people of Rainbow Valley.
-Who from?
-From the people of Rainbow Valley.
Hear ye, hear ye.
We can't be bothered with the mortgage man--
This time of the year!
You'll be sorry interfering with the law.
For spring don't care
About the mortgage man
This time of the year
I'm giving you your last chance to get back your land.
The dandelions in the dusky dell
Don't give a hoot in hell
-They're gonna smell without collateral
-This time of the year
-This time
-This time of the year
-Sweet merry buds and elderberry buds
-Don't give a good ding-ding-dang
Corn's shooting up
Fruit trees a-fruitin' up
Go tell Rawkins to go hang-hang
Don't mess around here
This time of the year
You'll get it in the rear
This time of the year
Magnolia's are sentimental
Persimmons are queer
Keep your distance, now.
Give way, there.
You hear me? l said, keep your distance.
Don't easily skeer
They sprout without real-estaters
This time of the year
That choo-choo's comin'
And it's mighty clear
Woo, woo, Woody's here
He's up there ridin' with the engineer
Yes, Woody's here
Just look at that choo-choo puffin'
Let's give it a mighty cheer
Just look at that engine huffin'
Dang blast it all, Woody's here
Woody's here!
Get a load of that whistle blowin'
That whistle is good to hear
It's wantin' you to be knowin'
Dang blast it all, Woody's here
Woody's here!
Woody's here!
And to think l let you whisk me out of lreland...
...across an ocean and down a continent...
...in the sweet, green month of April.
And for what?
For a beautiful new life in a beautiful new land.
-We came here to cure your arthritis.
-Aye, that too. That too.
Well, it's me that's cured of your arthritis. lt's all mythical, and so is that cure place for it called Rainbow Valley.
Now you've gone just a bit too far.
Here l have it on me map, witnessed and endorsed by Rand and McNally. l don't know who Rand is, but l could never trust a McNally.
But you can always trust a McLonergan.
Behold, that mythical land called Rainbow Valley.
Sharon, shake hands with a millionaire.
-A millionaire?
-A multimillionaire.
-Now what's happened to your arthritis?
-That's for the poor. l knew you were up to something. Now, will you stand still and listen to me? l can't. l can't. Oh, no.
Ever since l was 2, you've been seeing leprechauns...
...and rainbows over your whiskey jug.
Now, what pixified fancy of yours has really brought us to America, huh?
You'll love it here. You'll have everything you left behind in Glocca Morra.
You hear that?
What did l tell you? The same skylark music we have back in lreland.
-Aye, a Glocca Morra skylark.
-Aye.
I hear a bird
A Glocca Morra bird
It well may be he's bringin' me
A cheerin' word
I hear a breeze
A River Shannon breeze
It well may be
It's followed me across the seas
Then tell me please
How are things in Glocca Morra?
Is that little brook still leapin' there?
Does it still run down to Donny Cove
Through Killybegs, Kilkerry and Kildare?
How are things in Glocca Morra?
Is that willow tree still weepin' there?
Does that laddie with the twinklin' eye
Come whistlin' by
And does he walk away
Sad and dreamy there
Not to see me there?
So I ask each weepin' willow
And each brook along the way
And each lad that comes a-whistlin'
''Too-ra-lay''
How are things in Glocca Morra...
... these fine days?
Oh, now, Father, why are you crying?
Oh, it's that cheap lrish music.
Where is everybody?
-Hello?
-Hello?
Where are all the children?
What the devil?
He's up there ridin' with the engineer
Yes, Woody's here
Someone's coming. You better get up in that tree and take a look.
Don't easily skeer
They'll sprout without real-estaters
This time of the year lt's only the folk who live here.
America's full of gangsters, you know.
You said it was full of millionaires.
Don't argue.
Can't be bothered
With the mortgage man
This time of the year
Here. Take this.
The spring don't care
About the mortgage men
This time of the year lt's-- lt's gold.
-Aye. lt's a pot of gold.
-And you stole it.
-l never stole it. l borrowed it.
-But...
...who did you borrow it from?
-Why do you want to know?
-So we can lend it back.
-lt's impossible.
-Why not?
Because he's not mortal.
-You killed him.
-Of course not.
He never was mortal. He's a leprechaun.
A leprechaun?
Aye. Who else would have gold in lreland?
They sprout without real-estaters
This time of the year
Now that Woody's here
Now that Woody's here
Now that Woody's here
Now, don't think that this is gonna stop the auction.
You gonna pay them off?
Hey, Howard. You watch me.
Hear ye! Hear ye!
You ain't making a burlesque of the law.
Why not? That's where the law spends most its time.
Seen him in the front row last Monday night, Woody.
-Bet you did.
-Ain't true! Ain't true!
Quiet! This is an unlawful assembly.
Then this unlawful assembly is gonna have to come to order.
All right.
Read it.
Read it.
''Rainbow Valley parcel lot seven...
...is hereby up for auction for default of back taxes...
...in the amount of $ 777.''
-$ 777 going once!
-Yes!
-$ 777 going twice!
-Yes!
-$ 777 going three times!
-Yes!
Sold! To the Rainbow Valley Tobacco
Cooperative lncorporated.
Yeah. That's old Woody.
This covers it, except:
''Service charges, notary services...
...penalty and penal points, convertible debentures...
...miscellaneous and sundry add-on interest.''
Another $ 77.
No, it never said nothing about this in that bill you sent to my sister Susan.
Well, that's how it is with interest.
Don't make a sound.
-Just keeps compounding.
-Ain't you got the balance of the money?
-l figure l'm good for it.
-Cash.
All right, come on, sheriff.
Wait a minute.
Give me a chance to get my money back on this guitar. lt's too late for that.
Money don't grow on trees, you know. lt does for Woody.
Hey, Buzz, say hello to Rawkins!
Rawkins hears about this, we'll both be looking for new jobs.
Come on, sheriff!
Well, now. What do we have here?
-lt's an angel.
-Shame on the frivolous likes of you. lt's an lrish angel.
Your kith and kin pinning their hopes on you...
...and you go squandering your money on a music box. l did it for them. lt's a community guitar.
Aye, and l'm sure that's how you'll use it...
...on every girl in the community.
Daughter, that's no way to be talking to me future business partner.
Partner?
You accepted me money for back taxes, didn't you?
-l intend to pay you back.
-l don't want you to. l just want me property rights.
How much land you think you're entitled to?
An acre or so. All l really need is a parcel of land as big as me bag...
...on the closest point to Fort Knox.
We are in the vicinity of Fort Knox, are we not?
About two miles. ln fact, on a warm night, you can smell the gold.
Have we a deal?
-Yeah!
-Yeah!
-lt's a deal.
-Then give me your hand, son.
-Welcome to Rainbow Valley...
-Hi.
...home of the most prosperous tobacco company...
...in this state.
And l'll wager that.
What's your name?
Sharon McLonergan.
-Mine's Woody Mahoney.
-Mahoney. lt's fate.
How'd you get so pretty...
...and so rich?
You see, back in Glocca Morra where we come from, there's an old legend.
And it says:
You'll never grow old
And you'll never grow poor
If you look to the rainbow
Beyond the next moor
-That's a lovely legend.
-Aye.
-Wonder who thought it up.
-Me father.
Finian McLonergan.
On the day she was born
Said her father, said he
''I've an elegant legacy waiting for ye
'Tis a rhyme for your lip
And a song for your heart
To sing it whenever
The world falls apart
Look, look
Look to the rainbow
Follow it over
The hill and stream
Look, look
Look to the rainbow
Follow the fellow
Who follows a dream''
So I bundled me heart
And I roamed the world free
To the East with the lark
To the West with the sea
And I searched all the earth
And I scanned all the skies
But I found it at last
In my own true love's eyes
Look, look
Look to the rainbow
Follow it over
The hill and stream
Look, look
Look to the rainbow
Follow the fellow
Who follows a dream
Follow the fellow....
Follow the fellow
Follow the fellow
Who follows a dream
Bye.
Father?
Now, what would you be doing up at this hour? l'm taking care of you.
Any time the moon is full, a McLonergan will be too.
You go back to bed.
Where are you going with that bag and shovel?
Now, will you leave me be if l tell you?
Aye.
Then let me ask you this.
What do you think makes America different from lreland?
Has more lrishmen. lt has more money.
Everyone in America is rich.
But, Father, are there no poor in America?
No ill-housed and no ill-clad?
Of course. But they're the best ill-housed and the best ill-clad in all the world.
Why? Why, l ask.
And there's no man with wit enough to tell me.
So l'll tell you. Quote me self, quote.
Didn't the Americans rush to dig gold from the ground in California in 1849?
So l've heard.
And didn't they plant it in the soil at Fort Knox later?
-Granted.
-Well, that's it!
You see, there's something about the soil in and around Fort Knox...
...that gives a magical quality to gold.
-Father--
-The gold radiates a powerful influence...
...throughout America. lt activates assembly lines in Detroit...
...it makes skyscrapers sprout from the gutters of New York...
...and it produces a bumper crop of millionaires. And that...
...is the McLonergan theory of economics.
And that's why we came to America?
Aye. To bury me pot of gold.
Now, you go back to bed. lt's a witching night.
Aye. Very scary place. l'll.... l'll.... l'll....
One, two...
...four, five, six, seven, eight.
Green is the color of the shamrock
And the grass on Blarney Hill
Oh, the darlin' green of Ireland
And the good old dollar bill
God be with you.
God and Mary be with ye?
God, Mary and St. Patrick be with ye.
God, Mary, St. Patrick and St. Ozymandias be with ye.
-Ozymandias? l never heard of him.
-He was a special saint.
He's the patron saint of all the leprechauns of Glocca Morra.
-My name is Og.
-Og from Glocca Morra?
-Me native heath.
-Right.
You're an imposter. You can't be a leprechaun, you're too tall! l know, and l'm getting taller! l need your help, Mr. McLonergan.
-Me help?
-Aye.
That calls for a toast. l rise to welcome you to America.
-How are things in Glocca Morra?
-Alas, alack and willy-wally. l weep for Glocca Morra and all lreland.
You weep? Why, what's happened?
A blight has fallen over lreland.
-The British are back.
-Never seen such a curse befall a folk...
...in all me 459 years.
Alas, poor lreland.
-Poor lreland.
-Poor lreland!
-Suffering lreland.
-Suffering lreland!
-The native land!
-Oh, me native land!
A fine lot of fairyfolk you are, letting all this happen.
Why don't you wish it away.
We lost the power.
You mean you've gone and lost the power to make wishes?
-Aye.
-What has lreland to live for now?
-Answer me that.
-Doom and gloom!
Doom and gloom!
-Who's the author of this foul outrage?
-A monster.
-A monster?
-Aye.
You mean the old flame-breathing type, with the head of a dragon?
Oh, no. This is a tiny, wee monster.
He's about...
-...your size.
-Who is he?
Who is this monster?
Excuse me for pointing,
Mr. McLonergan, but it's you.
-Me?
-You brought the blight on yourself...
...when you stole our crock of gold!
The little crock that gives us all the power to wish.
Don't be superstitious, it's bad luck!
-Give it back, Mr. McLonergan.
-How do you know l've got it?
Me magnetic feathers pointed you out all the way from lreland.
Feathers, who's the culprit?
Oh, me arthritis!
Give it back, Mr. McLonergan, before a great evil befalls you.
Can't you postpone your wishing a couple of months?
Gold was never meant for mankind. lt's a fairyland metal that only fairyfolk can use. ln the hands of a mortal, it can only bring...
...doom and gloom.
Doom and gloom!
Doom and gloom.
Stop your wailing, leprechaun. l've come to a decision. l deny your existence.
-You're a figment of me imagination.
-l am?
To prove it, l'm going to walk through you.
Step aside. There, what did l tell you?
This is dreadful.
-l don't exist.
-Of course not. l'm always seeing things.
Ask me daughter.
But if l don't exist, how is it l'm gradually becoming mortal?
-The saints preserve us. You are.
-Aye.
So are all the other little leprechauns ever since you stole our crock of gold.
Look at me. Look! lt's crept past me ankles already.
-Can't you hold out until the winter?
-l don't know. l got a peculiar human feeling in me thighs lately.
Your thighs? Don't let it go any higher, man.
-Mary and Joseph, lreland's ruined.
-Father!
-Someone's coming.
-Me daughter.
And now that you're half mortal, you're indecent. Here, here, take these.
Now, you heard me, now.
You take those clothes and--
Father!
Father!
Sharon!
Mr. McLonergan!
-Father!
-Sharon!
-Father!
-Sharon!
Mr. McLonergan!
-Father!
-What fools these mortals be.
-Mr.--
-Father--
Father!
Now, what's a nice girl like you doing in a place like this?
Oh, it's you, Mr. Mahoney. l was looking for me father.
Not too long ago...
...they find a girl in the forest in the middle of the night...
...they'd think that she was...
...a witch. ls that so? Well.... lf you'll excuse me, l-- l'll be saying good evening to you.
You're not afraid of the werewolves?
Werewolves?
Our valley has its legends too, you know.
Haven't you noticed how strange the sky looks? lt is a trifle strange.
And look at the moon. lt is a cold, full moon.
The legend of the valley:
When the sky is strange...
...and the moon is full...
...the werewolves prowl.
-Unless....
-Unless?
That's a complicated part, and l know you're in a hurry.
Oh, no, Mr. Mahoney. l'd like to know the complicated part of the legend. lt's how to make yourself immune from the werewolf.
Well, how would l be doing that?
Well...
...you have to stand very, very close to the nicest, handsomest fellow around.
That must be you.
Must be.
Then you make yourself comfortable on the grass.
Now, you blink your eyes twice...
...and keep them closed.
Now you say...
...''petrified parsley'' over and over, real fast.
Petrified parsley, petrified parsley, petrified parsley....
-Feel immune yet?
-No.
Petrified parsley, petrified parsley, petrified parsley....
That's a lovely legend.
Who made it up? l did.
I look at you and suddenly
Something in your eyes I see
Soon begins bewitching me
It's that old devil moon
That you stole from the skies
It's that old devil moon
In your eyes
You and your glance
Make this romance
Too hot to handle
Stars in the night
Blazing their light
Can't hold a candle
To your razzle-dazzle
You got me flyin' high and wide
On a magic carpet ride
Full of butterflies inside
I wanna cry
Wanna croon
Wanna laugh
Just like a loon
It's that old devil moon
In your eyes
I look at you
And glory be
Something in your eyes I see
Soon begins bewitching me
It's that old devil moon
That you stole from the skies
It's that old devil moon
In your eyes
You and your glance make this romance
Too hot to handle
Stars in the night blazin' their light
Can't hold a candle
To your razzle-dazzle
You got me flyin' high and wide
On a magic carpet ride
Full of butterflies inside
I wanna cry
I wanna croon
I want to laugh like a loon
It's that old devil moon
In your eyes
Just when I think I'm
Free as a dove
Old devil moon
Deep in your eyes
Blinds me with...
-...love
-Yeah
-Howard, old buddy!
-Hey, Woody!
How's the Luther Burbank of the swamp?
-Mr. Moneybags.
-How you doing? l've been waiting for you.
Where you been?
Sharon, meet Howard.
Howard, this is Sharon.
How do you do? Nice to meet you.
Woody, l'm glad you're here. l got the list all made out.
Fifty feet of styrene tubing, quarter inch,
250 pounds of nitrogen tripalminate--
The voice you hear is the voice of the greatest research botanist today.
He's gonna change our whole way of life...
...and he's gonna do it with these little flowers right here.
-They're all his babies.
-We're doing it together.
Woody thought it up, and l'm growing them up. l ain't nothing but a suede-shoe boy peddling tobacco.
But Howard--
Howard is the first man in history...
...to mate the mint plant with tobacco.
You realize what that means.
No.
You are looking at the mentholated tobacco plant.
Here, smell.
Smell the mint-julep nicotine.
That's nice. Really smells lovely. lt's a whole new form of tobacco life.
-lt only has one drawback.
-What's that?
Well, it doesn't burn. lt doesn't burn? lt's worse than asbestos. lt actually puts fires out.
We're working on it.
-Yeah.
-Yeah.
Now that you're all back, fat with cash...
...gotta get to work.
Once l rig the styrene tubing...
...l'll take the nitrogen tripalminate in powdered form--
That's what l've been meaning to talk to you about.
What's that? The styrene tubing or the nitrogen tripalminate in powdered form?
-The cash.
-Yeah, what about the cash? l got some great things going. l made some contacts you wouldn't believe.
Wait, wait. Contacts? No cash?
Not a dime.
Well, you didn't bring back any cash, l'll go out and get some.
How? l'll get a job. Yeah.
But you've got a job, Howard.
That's to make it burn. Make it burn! ls that dedication?
Mr. Mahoney?
You're going to make plenty of money for everyone?
You bet.
Without doing a stitch of work for it?
Why not?
And is that what you call the''Mahoney theory of economics''?
No, but that's a pretty good name for it.
Why don't you grow ordinary tobacco that does burn?
Never get rich that way.
See you soon, Sharon.
Hey, Howard, buddy!
Don't take that personal. He's trained to do that to anyone what ain't white.
-You're the new boy from the agency.
-Yeah.
Okay, Stonewall.
Ain't l seen you somewhere?
-You worked here as a butler, didn't you?
-Oh, no, no.
No, sir.
Well, you'll like working here, boy. l've hired all of the senator's butlers for the past 10 years.
Hundreds of them. Of course, he's a little intolerant at times...
...but that's his blood pressure.
-What's your name?
-Howard.
Let me see you serve that julep.
Rawkins won't like that. That's no way to serve a julep. lt's too fast.
Get some shuffle into it.
You've seen some of the new movies, like Birth of a Nation...
...and Gone With the Wind, haven't you?
-Here, George, like this.
-Howard.
Yeah, okay, Jackson.
Your julep, sir. Master Rawkins, sir.
All frosted and minty....
You see, George?
Why do l have to shuffle?
Now, l don't have to explain that to you. lt makes for kindly feelings between employer and employee.
Once more, now. Try it again.
And not so fast this time.
How did you do that again? l don't understand you, Jackson. l mean, you don't walk or talk like you're supposed to.
You don't know how to serve a julep like you're supposed to.
You educated or something? l'm working on my master's.
Working on your master's what? lt's a college degree.
Now, don't mention the word''college'' around the senator. lt upsets him.
But that's beside the point.
Do you want a job here, or don't you?
Yes, sir, l do. l needs the money.
Well, that's all the more reason for you to make good here.
Then when you get your college degree, why, you got a job here for life.
-Buzz!
-Oh, l'll speak to you later.
You go around back and keep practicing, hear?
-Buzz, where are you?
-l'm over here, senator.
-l can't seem to see you.
-lt's these columns, senator.
-They sort of get in the way.
-Nonsense.
Those columns haven't moved an inch in a hundred years.
Meet me down by the glider.
Yep. Fine job you done yesterday, Buzz...
-...buying up all that land.
-Yes, sir. Bought up the whole valley.
Except one little parcel.
That'll teach them bureaucrats to stay where they belong, in Washington.
Cheap electric power.
Why don't they build their dam on the Potomac...
...instead of desecrating this heaven-given valley...
...with a lot of copper wire.
Electrocuting innocent bullfinches and sparrows.
Gentlemen...
...the festering tides of radicalism are upon us.
But before l yield up our glorious South...
...and her sister commonwealth, the U.S. of A...
...l will lay down my life. l will do more than that. l will filibuster.
Back, you crackpots. Forward, America.
Forward to the hallowed principles of our forefathers.
Forward to the sweet tranquility of the status quo.
Forward to yesterday.
Get this dog off-- Get him off me.
Caught him dead to rights, senator.
Spank on your property.
Oh, damn it, sheriff, can't you arrest a couple of chicken thieves...
...without disturbing the whole countryside?
Worse than chicken thieves this time.
These are geologists from Washington.
Geologists?
Two?
-l only see one.
-Senator.
This is a geological survey of the soil in this area in connection with the dam. l don't need nobody to tell me what's on my land.
Especially one of his kind.
Look, l read the findings on this meter. lt detected gold on your property this afternoon.
You found what on my property? lt located an amazing concentration of gold.
The meter reacted so violently, it broke the needle.
We're sorry about that needle, but we'll reimburse you. Now....
Just where did this unfortunate needle-breaking accident occur?
Parcel lot number seven, right outside Rainbow Valley.
-Oh, my God.
-What are you mumbling about, Buzz? lnvite these gentlemen up on the veranda. lt isn't every day we're honored with the presence...
...of two distinguished scientists from Washington, D.C.
Sorry, senator, we've got more ground to cover.
Gentlemen, l wish you'd accept my hospitality.
Senator?
That was the strip l told you about.
-What strip?
-The one we couldn't buy.
Well, gentlemen, l'm sorry you gotta rush off like this...
...but you hurry back real soon, now, hear?
We couldn't buy it? Who bought it?
We found out it was a man named Finian McLonergan.
Yankee brain!
Why weren't you prepared for him? l never saw him before.
He's an immigrant.
My family's been having trouble with immigrants...
-...ever since they come to this country!
-Don't you get excited!
You'll feel better when you've had your julep.
To hell with my julep!
Get me a Bromo, quick.
Howard!
Howard! Bring the senator a Bromo-Seltzer, quick!
And call my lawyer.
Tell him to find a loophole.
Where's that Bromo?
-Where's that Bromo, Howard?
-My loophole's choking me.
Where's that Bromo?
Coming, master. Coming. l'm coming all in there, yes, sir.
Yeah, l'm coming.
Will you hurry up on that Bromo?!
You're gonna enjoy it once l get to you.
-Get him his Bromo!
-Coming in there fast as l can.
-Will you hurry up with it?!
-Coming right there, fix your head good.
Mercy, sure gonna make you feel like you flying.
-Please, please hurry up with the--
-Come on, Howard!
Come on!
Howard, come on!
-Please bring me my--
-Howard!
Oh, Lord, l'm coming in.
Howard! Come on, bring that!
Get over here!
How are things in Glocca Morra?
Is that willow tree
Still weepin' there?
Does that laddie
With the twinklin' eye
Come whistlin' by
And does he walk away
Sad and dreamy there
-Sharon!
-Aye?
-Haven't you laundered my shirt yet?
-lt's coming, it's coming.
Not to see me there?
Not so hard. You'll be wringing the lrish out of the linen. lt is the neck of the Mahoney l'm wringing.
Oh, good, good, good. Lover's quarrel.
Healthy sign.
Are you sure? l know true devotion when l see it. l know a fine, upstanding darling of a man when l see one.
He's leaving for parts unknown this morning.
He's what? He's running out on you?
He's off to sell tobacco that doesn't burn. He's a schemer.
-You're well rid of him.
-An impractical dreamer.
-lt's deplorable.
-Total no-good bounder.
Get the wretch out of your mind.
-He's just like you.
-Aye, a darling of a man.
Now, look. Now, just a minute.
Now, don't you be crying.
A special rose...
...for your hair. lt has magical properties.
Beautiful bride you'll be.
All by myself, or is there a man involved?
Aye, there is.
He doesn't know it, but before sundown...
...Mr. Woody Mahoney will find himself betroth-ted to you.
''Betrothed.''
Betroth-ted!
How are things
In Glocca Morra
This...
...fine....
Well, this is a pretty bucket of fish.
How would you explain these shenanigans?
-lf you won't speak, back into the well.
-Oh, no! No!
So you've found your tongue.
Speak up for yourself.
-Why were you hiding in that well?
-l wasn't hiding.
Someone set me on fire, and l had to put myself out.
Oh, l see. Who was it put the torch to you?
A sunbeam.
-A sunbeam?
-Sunbeam disguised as a fairy queen.
But you can't fool me. l know a sunbeam when l see one.
Thank you.
-You're very poetical.
-Don't come too close! l'll have to jump again! l'm beginning to understand. l've known that feeling myself.
-You have?
-Well, only recently.
Came over me this morning, as you were sunning your hair by the brook. ls it a warmish...
...kind of glowish, kind of peculiarish sensation?
Oh, no, it's sort of a shiverish, kind of quiverish, flibbertigibberish sensation.
-Do you feel hummingbirds in your heart?
-Butterflies in my feet.
-Bees in your bonnet?
-Stars in my britches.
Does it make you want to dance?
-l hadn't noticed.
-And sing?
Oh, it does, it does.
Something sweet
Something sort of grandish
Sweeps my soul
When thou art near
My heart feels
So sugar-candish
My head feels
So ginger beer
Something so darish
So''I don't car-ish''
Stirs me from limb to limb
It's so terrifish
Magnifish, delish
To have such an amorish
Glamorish dish
We could be
Oh, so bride-and-groomish
Skies could be
So bluish blue
Life could be
So love-in-bloom-ish
If my ish-es
Could come true
Thou art sweet
Thou art sort of grandish
Thou outlandish cavalier
From now on
We're hand-in-handish
-Romeo
-And Guinevere
Thou art so adorish
Toujour l'amourish
I'm so cherchez la femme
Why should I vanquish
Relinquish, resish?
When I simply relish
This hellish condish
I might be mannish or mouse-ish
I might be a fowl or fish
But with thee I'm Eisenhows-ish
Please accept my proposish
You're under my skin-ish
So please be give in-ish
Or it's the begin-ish
Of the finish of me
What was that splash?
'Twas me, singing a duet.
A duet? By yourself?
Well, it could be, you know.
After all, l'm a witch, remember?
Train's pulling out soon. l wanted to say goodbye.
Well, goodbye.
-What kind of a goodbye is that?
-The best kind. Short, sweet and final.
How come l feel you're losing interest in me?
-Losing? Losing?
-l'm going away so l can come back...
-...and make everybody rich!
-Lost!
Sharon.
We're having a party
We're having a party
Oh, Finian's party we're having today
We're having a party
We're having a party....
Hey, what's going on?
-What's the occasion, Mr. McLonergan?
-What? Haven't you heard the gossip?
Me daughter Sharon's getting betroth-ted today.
Singing a duet with herself!
Sharon's getting betroth-ted
Sharon is getting betroth-ted today
Sharon is getting betroth-ted.... l hope you won't be taking it too hard, son.
-But then you'll be leaving town anyhow.
-l got a deal cooking, Mr. McLonergan-- l understand when a man's got a deal cooking.
He's got to cook it, or it won't get cooked.
On the other hand, many deals are cooked at home in your own pot...
...of gold.
-Gold?
-But then again...
...what is the cold, hard metal compared to the golden hair of the girl you love?
-Nothing.
-You're right.
Then tell me, why are you gallivanting all over the countryside...
...promoting and cooking deals when the lady you fancy is to be betroth-ted?
Well, who's she gonna marry? l hope you won't be after taking it too hard.
Why should l? lt's only love.
-That's a sensible attitude.
-Right.
Wait a minute! Who's the guy?
Now, who is he?
Now, if l tell you, you won't be making any trouble? l promise.
Very well. lt was last night she met him in the forest...
...and they sang about the moon.
Mr. McLonergan, that was me.
-Well, was it, now?
-Yeah.
Are you sure?
Of course! lt was me all along.
Well, that's a blessed relief.
Therefore, it's you that's getting betroth-ted today.
-''Betrothed.''
-Oh, yes, betrothed.
Finian McLonergan.
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!
Susan's trying to tell us something.
-What's she saying?
-l can't tell. lt's a secret.
-Woody, you tell them.
-Okay.
A secret, a secret
She says she's got a secret
A secret, a secret
A secret kind of secret
She's achin' for to shout it
To every daffodil
And tell the world about it
In fact, she says she will
-She says
-She says
If this isn't love
The whole world is crazy
If this isn't love
I'm daft as a daisy
With moons all around
And cows jumpin' over
There's something amiss
And I'll eat my hat if this isn't love
I'm feeling like the apple
On top of William Tell
With this I cannot grapple
-Because
-Because
You're so adora-bell
If this isn't love
Then winter is summer
Give in to summer
-If this isn't love
-If this isn't love
-My heart needs a plumber
-It needs a plumber
I'm swinging on stars
And ridin' on rainbows
I'm bustin' with bliss
And I'll kiss your hand if this isn't love
If this isn't love
There's no Glocca Morra
If this isn't love
I'm Zsa Zsa Gabor-a
If this is a dream
And if I should wake up
Will you hear a hiss
Will my face be red if this isn't love
I'm gettin' tired of waitin'
And stickin' to the rules
This feelin' calls for matin'
Like birds and bees and other animules
If this isn't love
We're all seein' double
If this isn't love
We're really in trouble
-If she's not the girl
-And he's not the hero
A kiss ain't a kiss
It's a crisis, man, if this isn't love
If this isn't love
He's happy to shout
And to tell the world about it
And I'll kiss your hand
If this isn't love
McLonergan!
How dare you come back here? Didn't l tell you you're an optical delusion? l was ready to believe you yesterday, but not today.
-Today l've got proof.
-What proof?
Does an optical illusion feel such a hungry yearning, burning inside of him?
Does an optical illusion feel the beat of the tom-tom...
...in the roaring traffic's boom in his lonely room?
You flying high and wide on a magic-carpet ride...
...full of butterflies inside?
Aye, and what's worse, smoke keeps coming out of me eyes.
You go round like an elevator lost in the tide?
That's the feeling!
Day and night, night and day!
Give me your daughter.
-What's she got to do with it?
-She's the one under my skin.
-Leprechaun, you're playing with fire.
-l know, and the fire's winning! l don't wanna be human. l don't wanna be human.
-lt's too inhuman.
-You're neurotic.
-Who's forcing you to be human?
-You are, by keeping my crock of gold! l'm only lend-leasing it. Give me a few weeks and l'll return it with interest.
Five and a quarter little crocks. l hope you're not using it to make wishes. ln the hands of a mortal it's only good for three, and after it becomes dross.
The way you talk, anyone would think l never had a pot to wish on. l'm sorry, Mr. McLonergan. l'm being a nuisance.
You're damn right you are!
You're worse than that!
You're the nemesis on me premises.
You're endangering me whole project.
-Where's your passport?
-What's that? l thought so. How dare you come into a free country without a passport? l'm legal, all right. l came in as a Christmas tree.
But l'm not leaving till l see me crock!
And l'm seeing me congressman,
Senator Rawkins...
...and l'm having you deported!
You're a member of a subversive, underground group...
...taking its orders from Dublin!
Woody's gettin' betroth-ted
Woody is gettin' betroth-ted today
Hey, mister, did you see our rooster? l got enough troubles of me own, thank you.
What kind of a rooster was he?
-He had pink--
-Green feet--
-And a yellow--
-Wait a minute. Wait!
-How many roosters did you lose?
-One!
-One rooster, all those colors?
-Yeah!
Well, now, let me see, now.
-Would this be it?
-Yeah!
-He must be magic!
-That's right! You get the prize.
-Do you do other magical things too?
-l do, but we'll have to act very quickly.
-l need your help. Will you help me?
-Yeah!
Now, listen. Somewhere hidden in the ground around here...
...is a little yellow crock. lf any of you find it for me, you can pick anything you like...
...here in me little magic book.
That's nothing!
We all have one of those.
Yes, but the difference is, from mine you can have anything you choose.
-Can l have a banjo?
-Can l get a fishing rod?
-Can l have an elephant?
-You can have anything you like...
-...that's made in fairyland.
-Without money?
There'll be things
Plenty-ish for all-ish
Wonderish toys
And magic tricks
Electrish trains
And basketball-ish
Mintish drops
And licorish sticks
Life will be keen-ish
All Halloween-ish
And jelly bean-ish too
With ice cream and cake-ish
And soda to sup
And no bellyache-ish
To wakish you up
There will be
Such delicious dishes
And we'll end
This daffish plot
For we'll go
From rags to rishes
When we find
That goldish pot
There'll be chocolate custish
With hot dogs and mustish
But Shears and Robustish
Must firstish come through
You folks belong here?
Yeah.
You mean you all live here on this property together?
-Yeah.
-This is my property, Your Honor.
McLonergan.
Now, Mr. Lonergan, l understand you got stuck...
...with this here arid, gopher-infested property a couple of days ago.
How would you like to unload it for, say, a profit of 30 percent?
-lt's the McLonergan theory giving birth.
-What do you say? l couldn't consider any propositions for six months.
You see, l'm conducting certain experiments.
Now, let me ask you, sir, just what kind of experiments?
Well, you see, Father is a mineralogist from the old country.
He can make gold sprout out of the ground.
Gold? There ain't no gold in lreland. l myself discovered a vein our countrymen have been searching for...
...since the reign of Alfred the Thoughtless.
Who?
You never heard of Alfred the Thoughtless?
Well, he was King of Erin, following his father, Thomas the Temporary...
...who in turn was the only son of the virgin queen, Serena the Spotless.
Are you willing to sell this land or ain't you? l'm willing and l'm wanting, but l'm waiting. l'm sorry you said that. lt'll put me to the trouble...
...of issuing a writ of seizure on all this land.
-Here's the writ, senator.
-Now, don't be crude, Buzz. l hate to do this to you...
-...but you've been violating the law.
-Since when?
This afternoon. l just finished drafting this.
''Local ordinance number 7428.
Be it known that in the county of Rainbow Valley...
...it is a felony for members of the
Caucasian and Negro races--'' lt would seem to me that this law could not be a legal law.
Of course it's legal! l don't know where you immigrants get these foreign ideas.
From a book the immigration officer gave us.
-Called the United States Constitution.
-Haven't you read it? l don't have time to read it, l'm too busy defending it! l rest me case. l wish you folks would understand our traditions. l wish--
Now, don't get in the habit of making wishes on me property! lt's not your property. l'll thank you to get off it.
And take your black friends with you.
-l don't wanna go!
-Shush, Henry.
You're saying you're taking this land from these people because they're black?
-Don't let them chase us!
-Shut this kid up.
He's making me look like a bully.
Sheriff, get them out of here!
You heard the senator. You folks better start packing your things. ls Henry the wrong color?
No, of course not.
He's the right color.
But there's something wrong with the world.
-l wish--
-Sharon! Sharon!
There's something wrong with the world you've made for people like Henry! l wish you could know what that world is like. l wish to God you were black! l'm a son of a biscuit.
Oh, my God! What happened?
-Stonewall!
-Somebody get a doctor!
Father, what have l done?
You shouldn't go around me property making wishes.
Hey, sorry, buddy, but it's that great come-and-get-it day!
-What's going on?
-The senator tried to take our land away.
Then l lost me temper with him, and l shouted at him...
...and he turned black!
Don't worry. That happens every time he meets somebody he disagrees with.
He sees red, turns purple with rage and yells himself black in the face.
But we don't need to worry about him anymore.
We don't have to worry about anything anymore. We got good news!
-A telegram for Finian.
-For me?
-Let me see it!
-Oh, no.
This is a singing telegram.
''Dear sir, after investigating your standing in the community...
...and finding you to be a citizen of high character...
...we have taken the liberty of opening an unlimited charge account...
...for you and your associates.''
Signed,''Shears Robust Company.'' lt says,''P.S. We hear gold...
...has been discovered on your property. Congratulations!''
Gold?
-Must be a mistake here!
-Mistake?
Hey, wait a minute.
Hey, what about this here?
Hey, come on, hurry up!
Hey, wait a minute! Wait a minute!
Didn't you hear the telegram?
We got credit! Wait!
Credit! Hold it, you're gonna dig up this whole valley. l've waited all my life for a break like this.
Yeah, but....
Don't you see, don't you know what credit means?
Credit means we can buy ourselves a tractor.
We can get ourselves a new planting machine, some tools...
...we can get laboratory equipment for Howard.
We can get our mentholated tobacco burning.
We're gonna make more money than you could get from digging up gold!
-He's right, you know.
-All right, Woody, when?
We want it now, Woody!
We want it right now.
Yeah. When?
When, Woody? When?

Come-and-get-it day
When the idle poor
Become the idle rich
You'll never know just who is who
Or who is which
Won't it be rich
When everyone's poor relative
Becomes a Rockefellertive
And palms no longer itch?
What a switch!
When we all have ermine
And plastic teeth
How will we determine
Who's who underneath?
And when all your neighbors
Are upper class
You won't know your Joneses
From your...Astors
Let's toast the day
The day we drink that drinkie up
But with the little pinkie up
The day on which
The idle poor
Become the idle rich
When a rich man
Doesn't want to work
He's a bon vivant
Yes, he's a bon vivant
But when a poor man
Doesn't want to work
He's a loafer, he's a lounger
He's a lazy good-for-nothing
He's a jerk
When a rich man
Loses on a horse
Isn't he the sport, ho-ho!
Isn't he the sport?
But when a poor man
Loses on a horse
He's a gambler, he's a spender
He's a low-life, he's a reason for divorce
When a rich man chases after dames
He's a man about town
Oh, yes, a man about town
But when a poor man
Chases after dames
He's a bounder, he's rounder
He's a rotter and a lot of dirty names
When the idle poor
Become the idle rich
You'll never know just who is who
Or who is which
No one will see
The Irish or the Slav in you
For when you're on Park Avenue
Cornelius and Mike
Look alike
When poor Tweedledum
Is rich Tweedledee
This discrimination
Will no longer be
When we're in the dough
And off of the nut
You won't know your banker
From your...butler
Come on, Finian!
-Yay, Finian!
-Yeah, Finian!
Go, Finian!
Let's make the switch
With just a few annuities
We'll hide those incongruities
In cloaks from Abercrombie Fitch
-When the idle poor
-When the idle poor
-Become the idle rich
-Become the idle rich
When the idle poor
Become the idle...
...rich
What a mess!
Well, l'm busy.
You gotta clean this place up, man. lt's a firetrap. l wish....
Do you see that?
You think this--?
-Are you sure?
-l think....
Are you sure?!
-No.
-Let's try it, come on. l gotta admit something to you, Howard. l never really thought this day would come, you know.
Come on. lt burns! lt burns!
You did it, Howard.
You did it! You did it! lt burns! lt burns!
-lt's gone out. Here.
-No, no, no. Still burning. lt burns, Howard...
...but it doesn't smoke.
You're kidding me.
Woody, quick!
The sheriff is down by the brook!
Come on, you got lead in your pants?
Doesn't smoke?
What's going on here?
This is the DA, Woody.
You better talk respectful.
How does this concern you?
-This is my fiancée.
-Well, how nice. l'll ask you. What do you know about the whereabouts of Senator Rawkins?
Nothing, and neither does she.
There's 50 witnesses saw her do her mumbo jumbo.
And the split second she did,
Rawkins turned black, disappeared.
-That's crazy talk!
-Folks around here are getting nervous.
Could be dangerous.
You're supposed to keep law and order around here, not this white suit.
That's why we're conducting this preliminary investigation...
...on charge of witchcraft.
Witchcraft?
-You gotta be kidding.
-Concludes Tuesday.
By which day, Rawkins had better be produced in the flesh. l'm sorry, but we're gonna be busy on Tuesday.
-We're getting married.
-Don't count on that...
...or anything else if Rawkins isn't back.
Bye!
Oh, Woody, you're grandish.
You've made me deliriously happy.
Happy?
Trouble makes you happy? Come on.
No, you make me happy.
-You don't know why, do you?
-No, why?
Because you said it.
And you said it all by yourself.
You volunteered it without me, without magic, without me father...
-...twisting and tricking you into it.
-What'd l say?
That l'm your fiancée, which is to say...
...l'm your love. lt is grandish!
And we're gonna get married on Tuesday. lt's grandish.
Didn't know what l was saying.
Something came over me, like a spell come over me.
Hey, wait a minute, now. lt ain't true, is it?
Ain't what true?
About you being a witch.
Of course it's true.
Me and my glance
Make this romance
Too hot to handle
Stars in the night
Blazing their light
Can't hold a candle
To my razzle-dazzle
-Oh, you got me flyin' high and wide
-Yeah
On a magic carpet ride
Full of butterflies inside
I wanna cry, wanna croon
I wanna laugh like a loon
It's that old devil moon
In your eyes
Kiss me.
How are things in Glocca Morra?
Is that little stream
Still a-ripplin' there?
Does the lassie
With the twinklin' eye
Go whistlin' by
And does she walk away
Sad and dreamy there
Not to see me there?
So I ask
Each weepin' willow
And each brook--
Give me that, boy!
You don't have to grab, mister.
There's plenty of apples around.
-Well, l don't see any.
-Because you're mortal!
You're mortal! Mortals can never see all the apples there are to be had.
An apple here. An apple there.
Little red apples everywhere.
You must be very hungry.
Would you like a sandwich?
Yeah.
Nice Virginia ham.
This is cheese! l ordered ham!
Forced to eat cheese.
-Forced to hide out like a hunted possum.
-Who are you hiding from?
My associates, my people, my dog...
...my whole way of life.
-l can't show myself like this.
-What's wrong with you?
Are you blind, boy?
Can't you see l'm black? l think it's very becoming.
Well, it isn't! l'm a white man, damn it! l'm a white man!
At least l was until a couple of days ago.
Well, that's a coincidence. l was green a couple of weeks ago!
Don't you find the change of color interesting?
No, l don't!
And they won't get away with it.
They won't get away with it!
Don't have to get so excited. l think it's just ridiculous making such a fuss about a person's color.
Well, you don't realize what it's like being black here.
But you're human!
A rose is a rose is a rose
Despite the color of your nose
You don't understand, boy.
-You're nothing when you're black!
-Nothing? Who says so?
-The law says.
-Well, it's a silly law.
But is it a legal law?
Of course it's legal. l wrote it myself!
-Change it back.
-How am l gonna do that?
-You said you had it changed days ago.
-l said no such thing.
-Some witch wished it on me.
-A witch! A witch!
-l can help you. What sort of a witch?
-l didn't look her up in Who's Who!
She's bound to be in Which Is Witch. lt lists their curses and cures--
Boy, go away, will you! l see your trouble now, mister.
You're too unfriendly. l'm in no condition for friendship!
That witch's fault!
She gave you a new outside...
...and she should've given you a new inside.
-That's very incompetent.
-Will you go away!
This will give witchcraft a bad name. lt'll set the entire profession back 100 years. l'll have to do something about it.
Me reputation's at stake. l'll have to alter your personality.
Stand up, please.
-Why don't you leave me alone.
-This won't be too hard.
All we have to do is to broaden out that narrow mind a little...
...reduce some of that bigotry...
...and your pomposity won't show through at all.
Wait till they see you in your new spring psyche.
People will say you're in love.
Now....
Fiddle, foddle
Foil and fiddle
Cure this fuddled individual
Whirl, ye waters, and unwind
This tangled, medieval mind
Breath of bee and bluebird's wing
Make this scowling spirit sing
Balm of briar, sandalwood
Season him with brotherhood
Magic vapors, make this person
A better person
Not a worse one
He sleeps!
The cure is beginning to work!
How are things in Glocca Morra?
Oh, dem golden slippers!
Oh, dem golden slippers!
Golden slippers I laid away
Can't touch'em till my wedding day
Oh, dem golden slippers!
Oh, dem golden slippers!
Golden slippers I laid away
Until my wedding day, oh!
Oh, dem golden slippers!
Oh--
Brother!
Brother, you're the voice in the wilderness.
Allow me the honor of shaking your hand.
Well, thank you, friend. lt's nice to be able to talk to somebody again.
Just whom, may l ask, do we have the unexpected pleasure of meeting up with?
Just call me Bill.
You folks from around here?
-We're from around everywhere.
-Yeah. We travel and we sing.
Haven't you ever heard of the Passion Pilgrim Gospeleers? l've been out of touch with the gospel recently.
We're the prize-winningest,
Gospel-singingest quartet...
...east of the Rockies!
Quartet? Why, there's only three of you.
Well, you see, brother, we suffered a casualty last night.
Yes, there was our number-four man,
Russ, suddenly taken with temptation.
And in desperation, he cries out:
-''Get thee behind me, Satan!''
-And Satan got--
-Satan pushed--
-He pushed him--
Right into the arms of a bouncing
Babylonian Jezebel...
-...from Biloxi, Mississippi.
-Oh, the soul was strong...
...but the flesh was weak.
And that's why divine providence led us to you.
You may be Bill...
...but that voice inside you is Russ. l wouldn't be a bit surprised. l had a lot of shuffling around lately.
Well, your shuffling days are over.
With your voice, we can go right on being a prize-winning quartet.
-l can make a living singing with you?
-There's a handful of ways.
Either tote that barge.
-Lift that bale.
-Shine that shoe.
-Or sing.
-We sing.
But before we do, somebody's either gotta get buried or get married.
Over in Rainbow Valley, there's a couple just aching to be spliced.
And a $20 bill just aching to be split.
Will you join us?
Brothers, you are now a quartet!
Well, good!
Now, in preparation for this ceremony...
...we take our text from Genesis, wherein it says:
Adam and Eve begat Cain and Abel.
From thence on, the history of the world is just the history of who begat who.
-Well, what do l sing in that?
-You carry the big theme of this song.
You stress the word''begat'' and keep stressing it.
Can you remember that? l got it!
-I got it
-I got it
I got it
We got it
The Lord made Adam
The Lord made Eve
He made them both
A little bit naive
They lived as free as a summer breeze
Without pajamas and without chemise
Until they stumbled on the apple trees
Then she looked at him
And he looked at her
And they knew immediately
What the world was fer
He said,''Give me my cane''
He said,''Give me my hat''
The time has come
To begin the begat
The begat
The begat
So they begat Cain
And they begat Abel
Who begat the rabble
At the tower of Babel
-They begat the Cohens
-They begat O'Rourkes
And they begat the people
Who believed in storks
Lordy, Lordy
How they did begat
-How they be-be-begat
-Even more than that
When the begat
Got to gettin' under par
They begat the daughters
Of the D.A.R
They begat the Babbitts
Of the bourgeoisie
Who begat the misbegotten VIPs
They begat
They begat
It was pleasin' to Jezebel
Pleasin' to Ruth
It pleased
the League of Women Shoppers In Duluth
Though the movie censors
Tried the facts to hide
The moviegoers up and multiplied
Lordy, Lordy
How they multiplied!
-How they multiplied
-How they multiplied
-Soon it swept the world
-Every land and lingo
-It became the rage
-It was bigger than bingo
The white begat, the red begat
The folks
Who shoulda stood in bed begat
The Greeks begat
The Swedes begat
Why, even Britishers in tweed begat
And Lordy, Lordy
What the seeds begat!
-The Lats and Lithuanians
-Begat
-Scranton, Pennsylvanians
-Begat
-Strict vegetarians
-Begat
-Honorary Aryans
-Begat
-Startin' from Genesis
-We begat
-Heroes and menaces
-Begat
-Fat filibusterers
-Begat
-Income tax adjusterers
-Begat
-'Twas naturaler and naturaler
-To begat
-And sometimes the bachelor
-He begat
It didn't matter which-a-ways
They begat
Sons of habitués
Begat
-So begats them all
-So bless them all!
-Who go to bat
-Who go to bat
And heed the call
Of the begat
Look, look
Look to the rainbow
Follow it over
The hill and stream
Look, look
Look to the rainbow
Follow the fellow
Who follows a dream
Follow the fellow
Follow the fellow
Follow the fellow
Who follows a dream
'Twas a sumptuous gift
To bequeath to a child
For the lure of that song
Keeps my head runnin' wild
So I searched all the earth
And I scanned all the skies
And I found it at last
In my own true love's eyes
Look, look
Look to the rainbow
Follow it over
The hill and stream
Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today--
Stand back, everybody!
-Don't want any trouble.
-Just what do you want?
Miss Sharon McLonergan.
Mrs. Sharon Mahoney in a few minutes, if you don't mind.
Dearly beloved...
...we are gathered here today to join this man and this woman--
No, no, no, no, no, no!
-l got a warrant for your arrest.
-On what charge?
The People v. Miss Sharon McLonergan.
-The charge is demoting!
-''Demoting''?
Demoting a member of the white race,
Senator Rawkins...
-...down to a member of the Negro race.
-By means of witchcraft.
There's a law against witchcraft in this state.
Yes, l know. lt was passed in 1690! l think it's about time we repealed that law. Right now!
Yeah!
Hold it! Hold it, l said!
Arrest that witch.
All right, Bill.
-Do your duty.
-Sure thing.
All right, come and get me, then!
Arrest her, Sam! Arrest her!
-Arrest her, Sam.
-Well, l'm only a second deputy.
-You're the first.
-Sheriff, quit stalling. Arrest her!
Turn them into pumpkins, Sharon.
-Yeah!
-Yeah!
Don't you try any hocus-pocus.
You can't goofer us now.
That there's lizard dust.
Lizard dust?
Witchcraft?
-You don't really believe l'm a witch?
-Arrest her!
Wait a minute, now.
Gentlemen, gentlemen, don't let her bedevil you.
A witch she is, and a witch she's always been.
Finian....
-He doesn't know what he's saying.
-Oh, yes, l do.
By the age of 10, she'd already developed her uncanny powers...
...and was changing me good whiskey into milk. lt was a crisis!
From then on, one change led to another...
...and now you're witnesses to this unhappy climax.
-She's changed a white man into a black.
-Let me talk to you.
Leave me alone. l'm doing the right thing.
All right, let's go.
Wait a minute!
You know, being a witch, she can also change a black man into a white.
She can make Rawkins white again?
-Or any color that Your Honor pleases.
-All right!
Turn him into a white man now.
-Just a minute! l got something to say.
-By God!
-Senator Rawkins.
-Calm yourself, senator.
You're in no position to have opinions right now.
Who's in a better position? Boy, can l see both sides of this question!
How much time will she need?
Well, for a bit of a thing like that, l would say until the crack of dawn. l will not be used as evidence...
-...in any witchcraft trial!
-Yeah!
Take him, boys! He's Exhibit A!
Her too!
Now, now, now...
...for your own safety's sake...
...if l were you, l wouldn't be trying to move her or him.
All right.
The crack of dawn...
...or it'll be the crack of doom, you hear?
Sheriff, move them all out but these two.
Clear everybody out!
Come on! Move!
Sit down!
Wait a minute!
Wait a minute! Wait a....
-Sit down.
-Get out of here, boy!
Get that boy out of here!
The crock's in the ground, and all's well with the world. lt's gone! lt's gone. lt's not here.
Leprechaun! Og!
Nemesis! Og!
Og!
Sharon!
Sharon McLonergan!
Sharon?
Sharon.
Look at me, Sharon. l'm 90 percent mortal now.
And 100 percent miserable. lt's a frenzy, a frenzy.
And the only cure for it is you.
Sharon? l feel better already just being near you.
The scent of your hair...
...the touch of your hand.
Oh, the miracle of it, the miracle of it, the sweet, sweet miracle of it.
She loves me.
Her hand fits me cheek.
Oh, Sharon, you're the only one, the only one!
You're not Sharon at all.
You're Susan the Silent.
Yet l still feel the same frenzy for you. ls this what it's like to be mortal? ls every girl the only girl? l'm beginning to like it.
Oh, my heart is beating wildly
And it's all because you're here
When I'm not near
The girl I love
I love the girl I'm near
Every femme that flutters by me
Is a flame that must be fanned
When I can't fondle
The hand I'm fond of
I fondle the hand at hand
My heart's in a pickle
It's constantly fickle
And not too''partickle,'' I fear
When I'm not near
The girl I love
I love the girl I'm near
Sharon! l mean, Susan.
Susan!
What if they're tall and tender?
What if they're small and slender?
Long as they've got that gender
I surrender
Always I can't refuse'em
Always my feet pursues'em
Long as they got a bosom
I woos'em
I love the girl I'm near
When I'm not near
The girl I love
I love the girl I'm near
I'm confessin' a confession
And I hope I'm not verbose
When I'm not close to
The kiss that I cling to
I cling to the kiss that's close
As I'm more and more a mortal
I am more and more a case
When I'm not facing
The face that I fancy
I fancy the face I face
For Sharon I'm carin'
But Susan I'm choosin'
I'm faithful to whos'n is here
When I'm not near
The girl I love
I love the girl...
...I'm near
So there you are!
The wrath of Ozymandias on you!
From dusk to sunup, l've searched forest and hill...
...and l find you philandering with a woman in your arms.
What's wrong with that?
What's wrong!
At a moment like this?
-Have you forgotten me daughter?
-l have not!
She's the woman l love...
...present company excepted.
The shamrock of her eyes, and her voice like the bells of St. Mary's....
-Has anything happened?
-lndeed, it has.
This is her last sunrise.
Twenty minutes from now, at dawn...
... the glory that was Sharon...
...and the boy that was her beloved will perish in smoke and flame. l told you the gold brings doom and gloom.
Gloom and doom!
Don't blame the gold!
You're the culprit!
-l?
-Aye. lf you weren't a leprechaun...
...you'd have had no gold. lf you had none, l wouldn't have borrowed it. l wouldn't have come, and me daughter wouldn't be burned for witchcraft! lt's my fault. lt's all my fault.
Oh, the merciful saints forgive me.
Her broken father will forgive you too, if you'd just spare a little magic for her.
Oh, anything, Mr. McLonergan.
I'd do anything!
Turn the senator white again
and save Sharon's life!
Og, we've only 20 minutes!
Well, Sambo.
You don't look like you lightened up a smidgen. l could do it in a minute and have 19 left.
Thank heavens. l knew you wouldn't fail me.
Why not wait 19 minutes...
...and leave it all to the last minute. lt's more dramatic.
Now, Og, now!
-lt's a matter of life and death!
-Very well, Mr. McLonergan.
-l just need one thing from you.
-What is it?
-Speak up, man. What do you need?
-A crock of gold.
Give me strength to resist me own strength to keep from choking him!
You stand there and pretend you haven't got it?
-But l haven't got it!
-Then why can't l find it? l dug more holes this weary night than all the gophers in Christendom!
Think back to when you buried it.
What were you doing? l don't know! How would l know? l.... l had a jug of whiskey in one hand and the crock of gold in the other--
You might've buried the jug and swallowed the crock.
You Machiavellian, half-pint pirate, stealing me property! l want it back.
-Please, Mr. McLonergan, l wish l had it.
-Where is it?
-l haven't got it.
-l'll throttle it out of you! l want it back!
Where is it? Where is it?
You perfidious little wretch....
-l'll throttle it out of you.
-l don't know where it is!
Where is it? l wish l....
-Where is it?
-l wish l.... lt's almost dawn.
They can't do it to her.
It'll be one of me or 100 of them!
Og...
...if you have a mite of merciful magic left, help me save me daughter's life.
Will you, now?
Oh, Susan, it's a crisis.
A crisis.
They're gonna burn Sharon for a witch.
She's not a witch.
She must've been standing by the crock when she made the wish.
Susan...
...you must've been there.
Where was Sharon standing?
Where was she...?
Oh, it's no good asking you.
You can't hear me. l'll have to ask somebody else.
There's no time.
Susan, come here.
Sit down. Look...
...l'll dance you the questions, and you dance me the answers, you see?
Questions, answers, right? l'll put it another way.
Susan, Susan, Susan....
You're a darling girl...
...and l love you very much...
...but l just wish to God you could talk. l love you. l love you.
Beautiful new words.
Will you say them again? l love you.
She loves me.
She loves me!
You're talking, Susan!
Where was Sharon standing?
-l love you!
-Oh, l know that.
But you're talking.
That means l must've wished you into it.
Which means l must've been standing over the crock.
The crock, the crock.... lt looks like you are permanently a black man.
Oh, my heavens.
What have l done?
The crock.
There's only one wish left.
The last one. lf l use it to wish the senator white...
...l'd never be a leprechaun again.
-We gotta sound the alarm.
-Yes.
Mr. Rodgers, sound the alarm.
Fire.
Fire.
Fire.
But l don't wanna be mortal. l wanna go back to fairyland.
Fairyland was never like this.
Where is she?
Rawkins, you blackguard, l wish you white!
-She turned him white.
-He's done it!
Thank you, Og.
Release those prisoners!
Come on! Keep that water coming in here!
-Keep the water coming!
-Keep the water coming.
-Keep the water coming!
-Keep the water coming!
-Keep the water coming!
-Susan is talking!
-Susan's talking!
-Susan's talking!
-Susan's talking.
-Susan's talking.
-Susan's talking.
-Susan's talking.
Susan....
Susan's talking?
Woody!
-Susan's talking!
-What?
-Susan's talking!
-ls it true?
Well, say something, will you? l've been waiting 20 years! lsn't it grandish, Woody?
You used the crock to wish back
Susan's tongue.
-Aye.
-And you used up the last wish.
And now the crock has turned to worthless dross.
Aye. Right, Mr. McLonergan.
Dross, worthless dross.
Hey, Woody! Over here!
The lab's going!
Four years of sweat and work, and it's all going up in smoke. lt's all right, Howard. We'll put it out.
No! No! lt's smoking!
Homegrown mentholated smoke!
I searched all the earth
And I scanned all the skies
And I found it at last
In my own true love's eyes
Look, look
Look to the rainbow
Follow it over the hill and stream
Look, look
Look to the rainbow
Follow the fellow
Who follows a dream
Follow the fellow
Follow the fellow
Follow the fellow
Who follows a dream l now pronounce you...
...man and wife.
Father...
...are you leaving us?
Aye. l've had Fort Knox. l see.
Things are indeed hopeless.
Hopeless...
...but they're not serious.
But where are you going?
To find me a rainbow...
...Finian's Rainbow. lt never fails to come up when a McLonergan is down.
Sure, there may not be a pot of gold at the end of it...
...but there's a beautiful new world under it.
Make it shine on Sharon.
Goodbye, me darling.
Goodbye, me friends. l'll see you all in Glocca Morra.
Sharon, where is Glocca Morra?
Well, you see, it's always somewhere...
...over there.
So to every weepin' willow
To each brook along the way
To each lad who comes a-whistlin'
''Too-ra-lay''
May we meet in Glocca Morra
Some fine day
How are things in Glocca Morra?
Is that little brook
Still leaping there?
Does it still run down to Donny Cove
Through Killybegs,
Kilkerry and Kildaire?
How are things in Glocca Morra?
Is that willow tree
Still weeping there?
Does that laddie
With the twinkling eye
Come whistling by
And does he walk away
Sad and dreamy there
Not to see me there?
So I'll ask each weeping willow
And each brook along the way
And each lad
That comes a-whistlin'
''Too-ra-lay''
''How are things in Glocca Morra...
... this fine day?''

7-8-9, uh... 7-8-9...
Fran, I'm calling the doctor.
Everything all right?
FRAN: Yes, dear, but we'd better hurry.
Yeah, all right, honey, just remain calm.
DR. PRUITT: Hello?
- Hello? Yeah, Doc...
- Hello? Who's calling?
Hang on just one second.
DR. PRUITT:
Hello? Hello? Who is this?
Doc, it's Mark Garrison.
- I hate to wake you up but...
- Is she feeling any pain?
Yeah, it's starting. She thinks it'll be pretty soon now.
DR. PRUITT: I think you'd better get over here.
We're on our way, Doc.
Thanks.
DR. PRUITT: Bye, Mark.
Hey, honey, I got Doc Pruitt.
I'm gonna bring the car around front.
FRAN: All right, dear.
Morning, Mr. Garrison.
You're up pretty...
[Engine revs, tires squeal]
...early.
[Tires squeal]
Take it easy, now... steady.
I'll get the door for you,
Mr. Garrison.
No, I got it.
So this is the morning, huh, Mrs. Garrison?
Don't worry about a thing,
Mrs. Garrison.
Just let me know when you want to hike your order.
[Tires squealing]
You're not worried, are you, honey?
No, but I wish we were there.
Yeah...
[Engine revs]
Only a couple minutes more now, honey.
[Siren wails]
Oh, boy.
That's just great.
Mark, we can't stop now.
Yeah...
The hospital!
[Siren wails]
Well, now, that's what I call service.
[Tires squeal]
Okay, on the ball!
We got a special delivery.
All right, let's get going!
Come on, go get a stretcher.
Well, how do you like that?
[Engine revs]
Be careful, sweetheart.
All right, what's the big i...
Oh, Officer,
I can't thank you enough.
We never would have made it in time without you.
Yeah, thanks a lot, Officer.
Oh, Dr. Pruitt!
Now, now, everything's going to be all right.
Don't worry. I'll take her.
[Door closes]
- A dog?
- [Whistles]
Well, yeah. Yeah.
I thought you knew, Officer.
You see, this is the first time my wife's had pups.
I mean, the dog has had pups, and I... she gets...
[Both laugh]
- Well, how do you like that?
- Yeah, yeah.
[Laughter continues]
Boy, wait till the boys hear about this one.
[Laughing]
A dog. [Laughs]
I certainly appreciate everything you've done, Officer.
My wife was pretty nervous.
You know how women get at a time like this.
Yeah, don't they always?
Yeah. Couldn't see it myself... coming to the hospital and all.
Way I remember it, dogs were, uh... they had their puppies at home in a... in a basket or a closet.
Yeah, mine had hers in a bureau drawer... right in my shirts.
- Is that a fact? [Chuckles]
- Yeah.
How about that?
Thanks for your trouble,
Officer.
No trouble at all.
Now, just a minute here, now.
Let's see what we got here.
We got 60 in a 35...
- Now, wait a minute, I don't...
...crossing a center line...
- I followed it around, honest.
...running a boulevard stop...
I did stop! I did, I did!
No, sir, you only slowed down.
We got doing 50 miles an hour in a hospital zone.
Well, I'm sure I wasn't doing any more than, uh, 40.
- Yeah.
Okay.
40 miles per hour in a 25-mile zone.
Do you have a driver's license, sir?
- Oh...
- [Laughs]
- Left it home.
- Yeah.
It's understandable in an emergency like this.
By golly, a fellow gets up in the morning, puts the first clothes on he can find, never checks his pockets.
- [Laughs] Happens every time.
- Mm-hmm.
No operator's license.
This your car, sir?
Well, of course it's my car.
What's your name, sir?
Mark Garrison.
Your address?
336 North Bowling Green Drive.
- Your business address?
- The same.
I work at home.
I'm an artist.
Engine number?
Engine number?!
Now, why in the world would I know the engine number?
Okay, it's your car.
I'll take your word for it.
- [Chuckles]
- [Sarcastically] Thanks.
Sign here, please.
[Laughs]
You forget something, maybe?
"No... parking."
I'd move the car,
Mr. Garrison. [Laughs]
FRAN: Oh, wonderful, Doctor!
Mark! Mark, we made it just in time!
Danke had a puppy.
Oh, that's great, honey.
That's just great.
[Motorcycle engine turns over]
FRAN: Bye!
Oh, wasn't he sweet?
You know, Mark, policemen must have a benevolent fund or something.
Couldn't we give a donation?
I'm giving, honey.
Believe me, I'm giving.
Mrs. Garrison? Two more...
I think that'll be all.
Mark, three puppies...
I can't wait to see them!
I'll be in as soon as I move the car.
- When can we take them home?
- Tomorrow.
That'll give the pups a chance to get a good start.
All right.
- Hey, Doc?
- Hmm?
Those three puppies... all females, right?
Yeah, right.
My luck's holding.
[Car door closes]
[Engine turns over]
Gertrude.
Gertrude Van Dankelein.
[Clicks tongue] Ugh.
Martha Van Dankelein...
You call me, honey?
Oh, no, I'm just trying to think of names for the puppies.
What's the hurry?
They have to be registered so they can get their papers.
You can't begin to get them in shows until you get their papers.
And you laughed when Jim Carstairs enrolled his son at Yale the day after he was born.
Winifred Van Dankelein...
Erma...
- [Yawns]
- Matilde.
[Sighs] It's been a long day, honey.
I mean, a very long day.
Hildagarde, Dagmar, Ermentrude.
Good night, love.
Huh? Oh, good night, honey.
[Sighs]
Mark... what do you think of these...
Freda, Esmerelda, Ludmila?
Fran...
Daphne, Dora, Diana?
Frances...
Yes, dear.
Isolda, Alberta, Brunhilda?
Heidi? Clotilde? Wilhelmina?
Don't question it, Doc.
I want to get some sleep tonight.
Huh? Get... oh, yeah,
I get it. [Laughs]
Are the pups ready?
Yeah, I'll get them for you in a minute.
There's one thing
I've got to do first.
- All right, no hurry.
- [Laughing]
Clotilde... oh, my, my.
[Barking, yipping]
Quiet, quiet.
Yeah...
Okay, girl.
Great Dane, huh?
Uh-huh.
[Muffled grunting]
Easy now, easy now, fella.
Easy now.
Easy now, little fella.
Easy now. I got you.
I've got you.
That's my idea of a real dog.
Ah, the greatest.
And Duchess there is the best Dane
I've ever owned.
- She's yours, huh?
- Uh-huh, she sure is.
Just between the two of us, Doc,
I'd give my back teeth to have a dog like that.
Okay, all right, all right.
- [Yipping]
- All right, don't get excited.
I'm getting to you.
Okay, all right, take it easy, take it easy.
Yeah. All right.
All right.
All right, come on, now.
Come on, come on.
What's the matter with this one?
Oh, nothing yet, nothing yet.
[Chuckles]
Looks like he's not hungry.
Oh, he's hungry, all right.
He's just not taking to the formula, that's all.
All right, come on.
Why don't you put him back with his mother?
No, no, that wouldn't work.
Why not?
Well, it's a case of too much litter and too little milk.
Duchess just picked him out and pushed him away.
Pushed him away?
Her own pup?
Well, they do that sometimes.
It's funny, the tricks nature plays, huh?
[Chuckles]
Now, you take that dachsie of yours, Danke.
- Oh, she's got too much milk.
- Yeah.
Why, she could feed her three pups and...
Say...
- Uh, oh, no, no, Doc.
- Oh, well, now... just so the dachsie could wet-nurse him?
Mnh-mnh, not interested, sorry.
Oh, no, wait, don't get me wrong, now.
I'm not trying to sell him.
I'd be glad to give him away just to keep him alive.
No, no, absolutely not, Doc.
Mnh-mnh.
Well, I guess you're right.
No place for a Great Dane with a family that likes dachsies, anyway, huh?
Here, see what you can do with him.
- Well, d...
- I'll go get your pups.
- [Barking softly]
- Oh, well, okay.
One drop at a time.
Oh, yeah, okay.
Well, now, wait, wait.
Hold on, there, fella.
Hold on, there.
Come here, come here.
Here.
Hey, come on, take some of this, now.
Come on, now, get it down.
That's one.
[Horn honking]
Oh, Mark, I thought you'd never get here!
Fran, wait just a minute.
Oh, Danke, I bet you're glad to be home again, huh?
Look, Fran, there's something
I have to tell you.
Oh, my three little darlings...
- [Barking softly]
- Danke!
- Mark, she had another puppy.
- [Chuckles]
- Well, yes, sort of.
- Why didn't Doc Pruitt call us?
Uh, well, he... honey, this dog here...
Oh, isn't she funny-looking?
She's a he.
What do you mean, funny-looking?
- Well, different...
- Well, yeah, it's different.
But, well, I guess it's because he was born later, huh?
Mark, it's getting too chilly for the puppies out here.
Why don't you bring them in?
I'll warm some milk for Danke.
Fran, honey,
I have to tell you this...
You know, Mark, you really ought to be nicer to Danke now.
- Why?
- For having a boy puppy.
He's what you always wanted, isn't he?
Yeah... he sure is.
Come on in, fella.
Dinner's ready.
Rover...
Prince...
Butch! Come here, Butch!
Come here, fella!
[Dogs barking softly]
Hi, how are things in the nursery?
Fine.
Good, good.
Mark, do you think that puppy's all right?
Which one?
The male.
Something seems wrong to me.
Well, what's the matter with him?
Haven't you noticed his head and his feet are all out of proportion?
Mark, he is positively ugly.
Well, I... I wouldn't say that he was ugly.
Well, I suppose he'll change when he grows up.
Oh, yeah, yeah, he... he'll change, dear, he certainly will.
Hey, what do you think it should be?
What do I think what should be?
His name.
We gotta have a name for him.
Oh, I don't know.
You pick it. I've run dry.
Yeah, okay. How about, um...
But, Mark, nothing like, um,
Sport or Butch or Rover.
I mean, that dog has champion bloodlines.
Well, it should be a name with some kind of... dignity.
How about Brutus?
[Laughing] Brutus?
Yeah, that has dignity and nobility to it.
Brutus.
I mean, it has a... a... uh, solidity and strength about it.
It's, uh... Brutus.
You know?
I like that.
Well, it's up to you, dear, but, frankly, it doesn't sound much like a dachshund to me.
Oh, no, no, it doesn't sound like a, uh...
Sounds like a champion, though.
[Telephone rings]
- Hello?
- DR. PRUITT: Hello, Mark.
Oh, hello, Doc.
- How are the dachsies?
- Well, they're just fine, Doc.
- And the Dane?
- Yeah, no, he's great, too.
No feeding problems at all.
No, no, no objections.
How's Mrs. Garrison taking it?
As a matter of fact,
I haven't told her yet, Doc.
- She's not blind.
- Well, I know she's not blind.
He must be getting pretty big by now.
I figure I've still got a couple of days.
They're not even out of the basket yet, Doc,
I want to give her a chance to like it, you know?
FRAN: Mark!
Um... uh, uh, uh, the preliminary sketches
I'm working on right now,
Mr. Dayton, and I should have them by the end of the week.
Thank you.
I'll see you then. Bye.
Am I interrupting you?
Uh, no, no, dear,
Nothing important.
Harry Dayton is a little nervous about that cover
I'm doing for his magazine.
Oh, is this it?
Uh, well, that's one of my ideas, yeah.
Why, those are the dachsies, huh?
- Uh-huh.
- Well, that's sweet.
But, uh, what is that big thing they're staring at so adoringly?
Well, that... that's a, uh...
I haven't decided yet, actually.
It's... it's a larger animal of some kind, you know, for contrast.
Oh, yeah, that's... that's a good idea.
You know, a... a Great Dane might be effective.
- You really think so?
- Mm-hmm... but you should be using Danke and the puppies for models.
[Chuckling] They're a little too small for that yet, dear.
[Chuckling]
Well, you haven't noticed how fast they're growing.
Come on, girls.
[Barking]
Well, how about that?
They're out of the basket.
[Whining]
And Brutus...
Well, will you look at him, huh?
Hey, look at the way he's...
...he's growing.
- [Fran chuckles]
- Kind of like a weed, huh?
Or like a Great Dane.
Now, just hang on a minute...
Just hold on there, now, for a minute, Fran.
I can explain everything.
Like you've been explaining for the last couple of weeks?
"There's nothing wrong.
He's not different.
It's just that he was born later."
- I didn't say that. You did.
- Well, what do you say now?
You still gonna tell me that's a dachshund?
I didn't say that, Fran.
Not once did I say that was a dachshund.
No, no.
You were sneaky about it.
You took advantage of me, Mark.
I never thought you could be that deceitful and sneaky.
Oh, now, come on.
You could have come out like a man and told me you were gonna bring that dog home instead of hiding it, smuggling it in with the puppies, Mark.
Sneaky, sneaky, sneaky!
Okay, okay!
I'm sneaky, but...
Mark, I really never thought that you could do something... that... sneaky!
Well, If you'll give me just a minute, I'll tell you.
- I don't believe you.
- You haven't heard me yet!
Well, I'm never gonna believe you again.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Well, for goodness sakes.
I'll fix it.
- Fran... Fran, if I hadn't...
- [Brutus yipping]
- Come here, little fella.
- [Whines]
If I hadn't brought this poor little puppy home, he would have starved.
- Starved?
- That's right.
Came from a big litter, couldn't get enough to eat, and... and, Fran, his own mother pushed him away.
- No!
- That's right.
Oh, poor Brutus.
Oh...
When Danke had her pups, well, she had too much milk, so, uh,
Dr. Pruitt asked if she couldn't wet-nurse him till he was weaned, that's all.
I tell you, I... I just didn't have the heart to refuse,
I really didn't, and I'm sure you wouldn't have, either.
Oh, of course not.
Oh, poor Brutus,
I'm sorry for all the nasty things I said.
Then you agree
I did the right thing, hmm?
Oh, Mark, don't you think
I have any heart at all?
I'm sorry, darling,
I should have known.
Then we can keep him, huh?
Certainly not.
He's been weaned.
He and Doc Pruitt will get along just fine now, sweet baby.
Come on, Danke!
[Claps]
- Come on, girls.
- [Barking]
He's a fine little fella, Doc.
Hope you find a good home for him, huh?
- Hey, Doc?
- Hmm?
His name's Brutus.
Brutus.
Yeah.
[Engine turns over]
- Mark?
- Uh-huh?
Here's your lunch.
Oh, okay, just, uh, set her down there.
- How's it going?
- Terrible, terrible... haven't had a decent idea all morning.
Working, working away... nothing happening.
Four weeks and you're still angry, hmm?
Angry about what?
Brutus.
That is ridiculous!
You see? You see?
You are angry.
Fran, I'm not a child, you know.
I mean, when I say I'm not angry, I'm not angry.
You forgot the cream.
Do you know how you have been acting lately, hmm?
So cold and distant.
You hardly ever talk to me, you never smile.
[Sighs] That bad, huh?
[Chuckling] Worse.
- I am a heel.
- Mmm...
I apologize.
And I don't have any more problems about dogs.
Mmm...
- Okay?
- Okay.
- [Whining]
- Mmm... mmm...
To make it official, we are gonna spruce up tonight.
We're gonna go out on the town, we're gonna see a show, gonna have dinner, put our glad rags on.
Well, I, uh,
I have a class tonight.
Mmm, a class in what?
In grooming.
Are you kidding?
You look beautiful.
Uh, for dachshunds.
Dachshunds?!
Well, we could celebrate tomorrow.
You know, tomorrow is your birthday.
That's really something to celeb...
You're angry again, right? Huh?
No.
No, I'm not angry.
See, I'm smiling.
Okay, tomorrow it is.
But right now, why don't you get out of here, let me eat my lunch, and get some work done, hmm?
[Barking, whining]
[Barks]
[Whining, barking]
Fran, I brought the car around front!
[Fran humming "Happy Birthday"]
Hey, what's going on?
It's darn near 6: 15.
A birthday calls for champagne.
That's very nice of you, dear, but we don't have time.
They won't hold our table past 7:00.
Oh, we have plenty of time... all evening... because we're staying home.
We're what?
I thought we'd have a private party of our own.
Yeah, but, honey, what about the reservations?
And I got tickets for the Philharmonic.
Oh, Mark, it'll be so much nicer here... just us, so cozy.
Oh... [Chuckling]
On second thought, that's not a very bad idea.
[Chuckling] I thought you might say that.
To you, my dear.
Besides, we couldn't possibly celebrate without the dachsies.
- [Coughing]
- Oh, Mark!
Mark, are you all right?
Without the what?!
Well, Danke and the girls.
After all, Mark, it is a family affair, and they are family.
They're dogs, honey!
- Mark, you know what I mean.
- No, I don't.
- Look, it's my birthday, right?
- Right.
That makes me king for the day, right?
Means I can do whatever
I want to do, right?!
- Right.
- All right!
I don't want to do anything with the dachsies.
Oh, Mark, now, I planned such a wonderful evening.
Don't spoil it.
You come over here, Mark, and you sit down.
You just relax, and... and you drink your champagne.
I'll be right back.
Come on, girl.
Hurry, now.
[Whines]
Come on. [Chuckles]
Hurry!
- That's it!
- [Whining]
[Barking, yipping]
Come on, Danke.
You're holding up the party.
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday, dear Mark
Happy birthday to you
- Mmm.
- All right, girls.
- [Growling softly]
- Come on, now, line up. Go on.
Will you blow out your candle?
Mmm.
There, now your wish will come true.
Now you can open your presents.
[Whining]
Here, this one's from Wilhelmina.
Wilhelmina, well...
I wonder what could be in this necktie box.
[Fran chuckles]
Well, imagine that... a necktie.
She picked it out herself.
Well, uh, my favorite colors.
Goes with anything, doesn't it?
Uh, and this is from Heidi.
From Heidi.
[Whining, growling continue]
A soup spoon?
It's a pipe.
Oh.
Here we go.
It's the latest kind.
Yeah... you should have told Heidi...
I stopped smoking two months ago.
Oh, I... I forgot.
Well, uh, this is from Chloe.
From Chloe, mm-hmm.
Well, let's see what we have here.
Just what I always wanted... a box.
Well, open it!
["Oh, Where, Oh, Where
Has My Little Dog Gone?" plays]
Oh, that's the wrong tune.
Uh, the one in the store played "The Blue Danube."
Well... this is from Danke.
From Danke? Well...
You like it?
I have no idea.
Well, don't you know what that is?
Should I?
Well, Danke didn't know what to buy you, so she took her favorite bone and had it bronzed.
Well, Mark, you could use it for a paperweight.
A bronzed bone?
Well, don't you think that's a cute idea?
Fran... there comes a time in every man's life when he has got to stand up and be counted, and my time is right now.
Mark, if you're gonna count, count to ten.
I'm only gonna say this once, Fran.
I have had it with those walking wieners!
[Growling softly]
I have had it!
I was willing to put up with Danke.
"Danke this, Danke that.
Danke wins a two-cent piece of ribbon."
You'd think it was a Nobel Prize.
But I refuse to go through the same routine with those pups.
I refuse to...
I refuse to let them run my life.
I will not have it anymore, Fran.
Keep them out of my way, or they're really gonna wind up sausages.
[Whining]
And thank you for a very happy birthday.
Now, just one minute!
Just one minute, Mark Garrison!
[Barking]
You are the most selfish, thoughtless, inconsiderate...
I'm selfish?!
...ungrateful man
I have ever met!
That is the most ridiculous accusation that...
Will you get your whatever-it-ls off my bed?
I want to relax!
That just happens to be my birthday present to you, and you can just move it yourself!
Well, thank you very much... for... for...
What in...
Brutus!
Fella...
What...
He... look at your hands!
Man, have you grown!
Good...
Oh, boy.
I, um...
[Whining]
...don't know how you put up with me.
I'm so blind.
FRAN: And selfish!
MARK: That's right, yes.
FRAN: And nasty!
Mm-hmm.
And mean.
And I just know
I'm gonna hate myself.
[Whining]
[Growling]
Come on, Danke, we'll try on your sweater.
Oh, Brutus, now, you know better than that.
Go back where you belong.
Go on. Go on.
- [Growling]
- [Yipping]
Danke, come!
Come on.
That's my girl.
Try on your sweater.
Yes, let's see if it fits, huh?
You'll be the prettiest girl on the whole block.
- Fran!
- Hmm?
Burp a baby for me, will you?
What?
Burp a baby.
I need it for a sketch.
Are the hands this way or that way?
I don't know.
I don't know, Mark.
Well, here, show me with Danke.
- Oh, Mark, come on.
- No, it'll just take a minute.
Stand up, here.
Stand up. Pat her.
There, that's the way.
- [Danke burps]
- Gesundheit.
- [Laughs]
- Yeah, that... that's, uh...
Hey, come out and pose for me, would you?
- It'll just take a second.
- Oh, Mark, come on!
- I have to finish that sweater.
- Just come out to the studio.

[Barks]
[Keys plinking]
[Keys plinking]
[Keys playing]
[Growling continues]
[Notes playing]
[Whines]
[Keys plinking]
[Muffled barking]
Oh, Brutus!
Mark, look what he's done.
Now, wait a minute... how do you know he did it?
You're not gonna blame it on those little angels, Mark.
Just look at them.
You can tell they had nothing to do with it.
One dog couldn't possibly have done all of this.
No, not normally one dog...
Besides, there's no real harm done, honey.
It's just a little yarn, that's all.
Just relax, now.
I can pick it all up... if I can find where it begins.
Mark!
Uh, Look out!
Mark, don't move!
Aah!
Mark! Aah!
[Sighs]
[Sarcastically]
Just... a little yarn.
[Chuckles]
- FRAN: One, two, three, smile!
- [Brutus barking]
Oh, that is beautiful.
Hold still.
Hold still, Brutus.
Ready? One, two...
- [Barking]
- What happened, you silly, huh?
Watch out. Watch out.
Oh, watch out.
- Come on, Danke, you look silly.
- All right, all right.
Chloe, stay, stay.
You're gonna slip. Watch it.
Everybody, smile.
- Ready? Now...
- Get over here.
- Take a break, huh?
- One...
- Wait a minute. Okay.
...two...
- Take it easy.
- [Barking]
Oh, Brutus!
Mark, will you look what he's done?
Yeah, well, he just wants to play with them.
Oh, he always wants to play with them.
He won't leave them alone for a minute.
Do you think he really believes he's their brother?
- Well, I hope not.
- [Doorbell rings]
Would you get that, honey?
I want to finish this roll.
Mmm, yeah, yeah.
[Barking continues]
Come on, girls, come on.
Come on.
Morning.
Well, good morning,
Mr. Garrison.
You remember me.
Um... oh, oh, yeah.
$ 110 worth, in fact.
Yeah, you sure piled them up that morning, didn't you?
Yeah, I certainly did.
- You know something?
- What?
So far, nobody in the department yet has written that many violations in one day.
- Is that a fact?
- I hold a record.
I'm certainly happy
I could help you out there.
Is there something I can do for you, Officer, uh...
- Carmody.
- Carmody.
- But it's, uh, Sergeant now.
- Sergeant?
I'm not just on highway patrol anymore.
- No?
- I'm on special detail.
- Uh-huh.
- Now, have you noticed any suspicious-looking characters around here lately?
Have you had any problems at night?
Uh, no, no. Why?
Well, there's been a lot of petty theft going on in this neighborhood.
It looks like it's the work of one man.
We call him the "cat burglar."
[Laughing]
You're supposed to say,
"Who in the world would want to steal a cat?"
- I am?
- Well, everybody does.
Oh!
Oh, well, I guess my sense of humor's not what it should be.
[Chuckles] But anyway, this fellow sneaks in, grabs the first thing he can lay his hands on, and sneaks right out again.
So you keep your eyes wide open.
Oh, I certainly will, yes, yes.
Uh, thank you for the warning,
Offic... uh, Sergeant.
And it's been nice talking to you.
Yeah, it's been nice, uh... it's good to see you.
Give my regards to the missus.
Yes, yes.
And the family.
Arf! [Laughing]
- [Engine turns over]
- "And the family." Ha!
[Barking]
Come on, now, Chloe, up you go.
Come on, that's my girl, yes.
Everybody, look at me now.
- [Whining]
- Don't move, Brutus, or you'll distract them.
Who was that, dear?
It was the police.
They're looking for a cat burglar.
[Chuckling]
Isn't that silly?
Who'd steal a cat?
Hey...
You know who that was out there?
Do you remember the cop on the motorcycle that escorted us to the hospital?
Oh, that nice patrolman...
Finnegan.
Yeah... no, no, Carmody, and he's a sergeant now.
Made sergeant on my money.
[Chuckles]
Every time I think about that morning, I...
Brutus, no!
- [Dachshunds barking]
- Oh, no...
Hey, what are you hitting me for?!
It took me 15 minutes to get them in that pose.
Now look what he's done.
Well, honey, it... it's just an old wheelbarrow.
Well, then you clean it up.
Come on, Danke, we'll go make lunch.
Come on, baby. Oh.
That's my girl.
[Barks]
Hey, Fran! Look at this!
He's learned to... learned to fetch already!
Oh, marvelous, just marvelous.
Good boy.
Let me have it now.
Let go of it, let go.
- [Growling]
- Let go, Brutus.
Let go.
Let... let go of the wheel.
[Growling continues]
Brutus, let go of the wheel.
Let go...
Aah! Aah! Aaah!
[Whines]
Well, now, maybe you could stand a few improvements.
What happened?
Nothing. I just sat down in the lily pond, that's all.
I'm gonna change clothes.
Honestly, Mark, you're getting to be as clumsy as Brutus.
[Barking]
[Barking]
[Barking continues]
[Barking continues]
[Barking]
[Barking]
[Barking continues]
[Barking continues]
FRAN: Mark!
[Gasps]
Oh!
Well! Now are you satisfied, hmm?
Mark, are you satisfied?
Or are you gonna try and blame this on the dachsies, too?
- Why not? We always do.
- Fran...
Of course, the fact that the little innocent things are nowhere in sight shouldn't make any difference.
They must be responsible.
They always are.
And poor, poor persecuted Brutus is blameless.
Of course, the fact that he has paint all over him and paintings stuck on his feet is merely circumstantial evidence.
- That doesn't prove anything.
- Fran, will you shut up?
Oh, I'm sorry...
Fran, I...
I'm very sorry.
That's all right, Mark.
I excuse your rudeness on the grounds that you are justifiably overwrought.
You needn't apologize.
But if you ever say "shut up" to me again, Mark Garrison, neither I nor the girls will ever speak to you again.
Oh, boy.
[Barking]
Oh... boy.
$20 to scrape studio floor,
$23 to replace two broken windows.
[Barking]
$ 12 to repair easel.
What should I put down for one month's work ruined?
Fran, it was my work, and it was my studio.
All right, Mark.
Last week, it cost me $ 18 to repair my couch slipcovers and $92 to replace my mother's broken vase.
Fran, Brutus is still a puppy at heart.
I know that, Mark.
That is what worries me.
His career is just beginning.
- Well...
- Now, Mark... that dog is too destructive.
- He has got to go.
- [Barking continues]
No, he isn't!
For... shut up!
The puppy, shut up.
Uh, Brutus. Uh...
Look, Fran...
- [Barking continues]
- Brutus, will you be quiet?!
You hear me, Brutus?
Be quiet!
Oh, don't waste your breath,
Mark.
He's as stubborn as you are.
Well, I'll... put him out in the garage.
What did I do with that flashlight?
Come on! [Clapping]
Come on, come on!
Yes! Oh, here's my girls.
All right, everybody on the end of the bed.
Come on, it's time to go to sleep. Go on.
Go on, at the end of the bed.
Oh, now, don't be silly.
Come on.
There you are.
Oh, stop it, girls.
No, girls, don't do that.
Oh, just calm down, now.
- [Barking continues]
- Brutus, no!
Aah! Ooh!
[Dogs barking]
Oh!
- Oh!
- Come here, Brutus.
Come here. Come here, now.
Honey, are you okay?
One new bed... $200!
All right, I... I give up.
He goes back to Doc first thing in the morning.
Come on, Brutus.
Oh!
[Barking]
Oh!
- [Crickets chirping]
- Wait a minute, now.
Hold it, Brutus.
Why couldn't you have been good for something?
Anything?
Now, go on in there, fella.
Lie down.
[Whimpers]
This'll give you plenty of air.
[Whimpering, whining]
Be quiet.
[Barking]
Hush!
[Whining]
Hush up, Brutus!
[Doorknob rattles]
Oh, great, beautiful, beautiful.
[Sighs]
[Grunting]
The end of a perfect day.

You have the wrong man, the wrong man.
- I'm a policeman. Shh!
- [Growling]
- Aaah!
- [Barking]
Aah, hold it.
Hold it right there.
Hold it. Hold it.
Hold it.

- Aah! [Panting]

Get away!
[Barking]
Mark, don't fight it.
[Sighs]
CARMODY: Mr. Garrison!
Mr. Garrison!
Get away! Go on!
Mr. Garrison!
Mr. Garrison!
Wake up!
It's me... Sergeant Carmody!
Go on! Get away!
Go on, get away!
Mr. Garrison!
MAN ON POLICE RADIO:
Calling Sergeant Carmody,
Car 23.
Calling Sergeant Carmody,
Car 23, Signal 15... investigate disturbance on Bowling Green Drive... dog barking.
Repeat... investigate disturbance on Bowling Green Drive... dog barking.
That is all.
[Panting]
[Door opens]
I wish that paper would show up just once on time!
[Barking]
Brutus!
[Hoarsely] Mr. Gar...
Mr. Garrison.
Mr. Garrison.
Up here!
Sergeant Carmody.
What are you doing up there?
[Grunts] Your dog chased me.
Hush! Come here.
What?
- Dog won't let me down.
- I can't understand you.
[Exhales sharply]
I... I... I can't talk.
Hey, you haven't been up there all night, have you?
Yeah.
What in the world for?
Your dog chased me.
Oh, you mean Brutus chased...
How about that?
Now, look, would you take him away and let me down?
Hey, you know, I bet he...
I bet he thought you were the cat burglar.
- Fran!
- No. Wait. Would you please...
No, no, just a minute, Sergeant.
I want to prove something to my wife first. Fran!
Mark, what's wrong?
Hey, come here a minute.
I want to show you something.
Will you just let me down?
Uh, Fran, you remember
Sergeant Carmody.
He escorted us to the hospital.
Lady, will you talk to him?
Will you please talk to him?
Well, I don't know what this is all about.
I wanted you to see Brutus.
He chased him up that tree.
What do you think of that?
What do you think I think, Mark?
That's a police officer.
Now, how would Brutus know the difference?
It's just a prowler to him.
He could've been that burglar they're chasing around town.
He defended us!
He protected our property!
All right, Mark, but still...
Don't you see how important he is to us, how valuable?
If we keep him around here, no burglar would come within miles.
All right, Mark, you've made your point.
We can discuss it later.
In the meantime, will you please let the officer down from the tree?
- [Laughs]
- Yeah, okay.
Just wanted you to see, that's all.
Oh, uh, come on down, Sergeant.
Dog... the dog.
Oh.
Good boy, Brutus. Good boy.
Go on back to the house now.
Go on. Go on.
Okay, Sergeant, it's safe now.
[Panting]
Here, let me help.
Whoa.
[Breathing heavily]
I don't need any help.
Oh, well, let me give you a hand to the car.
No, no, no, do... don't bother, Mr. Garrison.
- Would you like some breakfast?
- I'm not hungry.
- How about a cup of coffee?
- I'm not thirsty.
Want an aspirin, glass of water?
Look, all I want to do is get out of here.
- Oh, okay.
- Yeah.
Uh, drop in again anytime,
Sergeant.
Yeah. [Breathing heavily]
So long now.
[Grunts]
[Panting]
This is Sergeant Carmody in...
[Clicking]
- This is Sergeant...

[Doorbell rings]
Oh, Mr. Toyama.
Good morning, Mrs. Garrison.
Um, well, you're early.
I wasn't expecting you until later.
- There is much to be done.
- Oh.
I bring Kenji... newly imported, number-one nephew.
Oh, uh, would you mind starting in the back?
We haven't finished breakfast yet.
As you wish.
[Barking]
Dogs?
Uh, they're very friendly.
Well, they won't bother you.
- [Barking continues]
- Quiet, girls!
- Who was that?
- Toyama.
So early?
[Imitating Toyama]
Ah, there is much to be done.
[Normal voice] He's got to get the decorations and the food and the tables set up by 6:00.
What is this Oriental bacchanal costing us, anyway?
Mark, we haven't entertained in six months.
We owe everybody.
Yes, I did make my hair appointment.
Yes, I did pick my dress up at the cleaners.
That evasive answer means it's costing a bundle, right?
Wrong. We're getting a package deal... food, decorations, everything for one reasonable price.
Yes, I ordered the guest towels for the bathroom.
No, I did not speak to Mark first thing this morning.
Sure you did. I said,
"Did you sleep well?"
And you said,
"Make your own breakfast."
About Brutus.
Mark, you've got to get rid of that dog.
Now, wait just a minute, Fran.
Now, let's not start that again.
Brutus is my dog, and I am...
I mean for today, Mark, so he won't be underfoot.
I mean, it's difficult enough to prepare a lawn party for 60 people without that
4-legged demolition squad running around in the middle of it.
Demolition squad?
Now, what about that, uh, wrecking crew of yours, huh?
Mark Garrison, how can you compare those dear, sweet, little angels with that big, clumsy ox?
Okay.
All right, Fran, I'll, uh... take him for a walk, all right?
You'll do no such thing.
I need you here to help me.
Just tie him up.
What am I gonna do, Fran?
I thought Toyama's taking care of everything.
Well, Mark, you know something always goes wrong at the last minute, and I want you here just in case.
In case of what, for example?
KENJI: Rion! Rion!
In case of that, for example.
[Shouting in Japanese]
Aah! Rion!
- [Speaking Japanese]
- Rion?
Mark, look!
Brutus!
- Brutus!
- Brutus, Brutus, come here.
Come here, fella. Come on.
Mr. Toyama, are you all right?
Take away rion!
That's not a lion!
That's a dog.
You call that dog?
[Brutus barking]
Mr. Toy... Mr. Toyama!
Well, you can't just lie there.
Only way to fool wild beast.
- [Barks]
- Oh, Brutus, boy.
Oh, Mark, will you take him away and tie him up somewhere?
Oh, for Pete's sake, he wasn't gonna hurt anybody.
Rook out... rion!
[Gasps]
[Speaking Japanese]
[Mid-tempo accordion music plays]
[Indistinct conversations]
[Speaking Japanese]
[Speaking Japanese]
How is everything,
Mr. Toyama?
Nobody eat kombu.
Kombu?
Stuffed seaweed.
Oh, well, uh, I'm...
I'm sure everybody will.
Well, good evening,
Mrs. Garrison.
Oh, hello, Dr. Pruitt.
Well, I've been waiting for a chance to pay my respects to the hostess.
Nice of you to ask me.
Oh, you don't think we'd forget the family vet, do you?
Well, I'd hope not.
How are the dogs?
Oh, just adorable, especially Chloe.
You know, I think she's got the makings of a champion.
Well, there's the man who could tell you for sure.
And so I said to her,
"Madam, I'm judging your dogs, not you."
[Laughter]
Uh, Mel Chadwick?
He's an expert on dachsies.
Or didn't you know?
Well, I did know that he was judging the Fairview Dog Show next month.
Ah. Chloe is entered,
I suppose.
Oh, Dr. Pruitt, you don't think that I arranged this whole party just to get on his good side, do you?
Oh, no, no, no, never entered my mind.
[Chuckles] Well, I did.
[Laughs]
It's wicked of me, huh?
No, no, not a bit.
Why don't you bring Chloe out here and show her to him?
Oh, no, I couldn't.
But you will.
Of course I will.
Will you excuse me?
Yeah, I will... and good luck.
[Laughing] Oh, my.
Kombu?
Eh, kombu?
Well, I don't think, uh...
Come on, Chloe. Come on.
You girls stay. Stay.
Stay.
[Indistinct conversations]
All right, Chloe, you go.
Go on.
Of course, so few of us have the ability to...
- Recognize such a...
- Excuse me. Excuse me.
...quality.
Chloe, bad girl.
What did you do?
Hey, I thought we agreed to keep the animal life out of here.
Oh, well, it was an accident, dear.
She just kind of got out.
Oh, uh, would you put those chairs over there, and could you get me two more for the hors d'oeuvre table?
Oh, that's a cute... yes.
Well, well, well, what have we here?
Your dog, Mrs. Garrison?
Yes. This is Chloe.
A fine-looking animal.
Uh, may I?
Oh, of course.
[Slow accordion music plays]
Better sit down, Harry.
Remember New Year's Eve.
Nobody'll let me forget.
Good back line.
Ear set... good.
Fine head.
You intend to show her?
Well, I... I was thinking about it, if you think she's good enough.
There's one way to find out.
Why don't you put her in the Fairview show next month?
Chloe! Chloe!
No, no, no,
Mrs. Garrison, let her go.
Dachsies love to be around people.
Oh, but I know some people who don't love to be around dachsies.
Oh, nonsense!
[Whimpers]
[Shouting in Japanese]
Uh, my sentiments exactly,
Mr. Toyama.
Dog not belong here.
That's right.
You hear that, Chloe?
Now, go on. Beat it.
[Speaking Japanese]
Hi, Mark.
Well, hello, Doc.
How are you?
Hey, it looks like your wife has her wish... a real champion.
Uh-huh. A real pain sometimes,
I'll tell you that.
- Go on, Chloe. Beat it. Go on.
- [Barks]
Well, of course, I can see where your sympathies lie.
How is Brutus?
He's getting along just great.
Would you like to see him?
I sure would.
Brutus deserves something out of this party.
- Come on.
- All right.
[Laughter, indistinct conversations]
[Gate opens, closes]
[Laughs] Yes, sir, Mark, he is beautiful.
Of course, I could see that when he was a pup.
The best Dane I ever bred,
I think.
Yeah.
And is your wife getting used to having him around now?
Doc, let's say she's adjusted to it.
The dachshunds are her pets... especially that little ol'Chloe.
She's really got the bug.
She's not gonna be happy till she wins a blue ribbon.
Well, what about you?
Did you ever think of trying for one yourself?
A... you mean with Brutus?
He's a fine dog.
Oh, Doc, that's what he's gonna stay, too...
[Chuckling] just plain doggy.
I don't want any spoiled and pampered show horse on my hands.
Chloe?
Chloe?
Mark, what are you doing here?
Oh, just showing Brutus to Dr. Pruitt.
Is Chloe still wandering around?
I thought you were gonna put the little wiener back in the house.
Oh, she's not doing any harm.
You know, she probably found someplace to hide where she could watch the fun.
You know, we should be getting back to the guests, huh?
Okay. Let's go, Doc.
See you later, boy.
MARK: So long, Brutus.
- [Gate closes]
- [Growls softly]
[Barking]
[Growls]
[Barking]
[Dogs barking]
- Excuse me.
- Mark?
- What?
- Where are you going?
Oh, I'm just wondering what was bothering Brutus.
There's nothing wrong with Brutus.
Now, he's perfectly all right, and will you please pay attention to our guests?
[Barking]
[Squeaking]
[Up-tempo accordion music plays]
[Barking softly]
Mr. Chadwick, I don't believe you've met my husband.
- Hello.
- Oh, Chloe's father.
How do you do,
Mr. Garrison?
MAVIS: Eat something, Harry.
"Eat something, Harry."
Nobody ever says,
"Drink something, Harry."
[Sighs]
Ah, you cute, little rascal.
Mavis!
Mavis, come here.
I want to show you something.
Come on, I want to show you the cutest thing.
There's a tiny, little dog in there eating a bone.
Harry.
No, honest.
You can see for yourself.
Just look in the pagoda.
- [Barks]
- Aaaah!
- Aaaah!
- What's that?
[Indistinct shouting]
Rion!
Rion!
Rion!
Rion?!
- Lion?
- Oh, it can't be. He's tied up.
Rion!
Rion! Rion!
Where is he?
Where is he?
[Speaking Japanese]
Aaah!
[Barking]
- Aaah!
- Brutus!
[Speaking Japanese]
- [Barks]
- Aaah!
Brutus! Come here!
Brutus!
- Oh!
- Aaaah!
Oh, Mark! Oh!
[Brutus continues barking]
Oh, don't stand there!
Do something!
Stop him!
Brutus! Come here, Brutus!
Come here!
Brutus!
Brutus!
Excuse... me.
[Continues barking]
Aaah! Aaah!
[Grunts]
Aaah!
- Aaah! Aaah!
- Aaah!
Oh, Mark!
[Kenji shouting in Japanese]
[Shouting continues]
Aaaah!
Aaah!
Whoa, boy! Whoa, boy!
Whoa!
- Brutus, stop!
- Oh, stop him!
Aaaah!
Brutus!
[Barking continues]
What a dog.
[Indistinct shouting]
What's the matter with you, Garrison?
Can't you control your dog?
Well... Brutus!
- Hold it!
- Aaah!
Come on, stop!
Brutus, come here!
- Mark!
- I'm trying!
Brutus?!
Here, boy! Here, boy!
Mr. Chadwick!
Mr. Chadwick, just grab my hand!
Mrs. Ga...
Ugh! Aaah!
[Women screaming]
[Plays off-key]
Fran!
- Fran, you okay, honey?
- [Coughing]
Oh... Mark!
Now, here we go.
Ugh! Mark!
Fran, I... I really am sorry about this.
I...
- Mark!
- I really am, honey.
- Mark!
- Fran?
- Mark!
- Fran!
[Whimpers]
I wish you hadn't done that, Brutus.
[Growls softly]
[Telephone ringing]
Oh, Brutus...
Knock it off, will you?!
Stay!
Now, knock it off, Brutus.
That goes for all of you.
[Barking]
[Continues barking]
Who was that?
Where?
On the telephone.
Toyama.
Oh.
When is he coming to clean up?
He isn't.
- Oh.
- Neither is Kenji.
In fact, the entire
Japanese-American community has declared our house a disaster area.
[Chuckles]
Well, when is he coming for his junk?
It is now our junk.
What?
$325 worth of Japanese lanterns, broken hibachis, and papier-mâché pagodas.
That, in addition to what we'll undoubtedly have to pay for ruined clothes, medication, and the shattered nerves of all our ex-friends and neighbors.
Yeah, okay.
The telephone has not stopped ringing.
Mel Chadwick is on the verge of pneumonia,
Jane Felton had a nervous breakdown, and the drugstore has run out of vaporizers.
Yeah, okay. All right.
- Mark.
- [Dogs whimpering]
Mark, I think you should know that I called Dr. Pruitt this morning.
To tell him what?
To tell him that you will be returning Brutus this afternoon.
Returning Brutus?!
My mind is made up.
That dog turned vicious.
- He goes or else.
- Or else what?
Listen here, he was absolutely blameless for what happened last night, Fran!
Oh-ho-ho, blameless?!
Brutus is a kind, lovable, intelligent animal!
- [Barking]
- Ah, shut up, you idiot.
[Whimpering]
Now, listen, Fran, let's sit down and calmly and coolly discuss this thing!
[Barking]
[Growls softly, barking]
[Vehicle approaching]
[Whirring]
Ah, good morning, Brutus.
Up kind of early, ain't you?
Oh, now, did you make this mess?
You ought to be ashamed of yourself.
[Grunts]
[Panting]
You shouldn't eat this stuff.
It ain't good for you.
Looks like it was quite a party.
[Grunting]
[Barking]
Hey, what did you do... lose a bone in there or something?
Come on, get down. There's nothing for you in there.
Attaboy.
[Whimpering]
[Grunts, chuckles]
[Barking]
[Whirring]
[Barking]
Sorry, pal.
Whatever it is you wanted is gone now.
[Growling]
[Barking]
Come on!
This is no time for games.
Hey, what's... what's the matter with you?
It's me... Eddie.
Say...
What's the matter... you sick or something?
Knock it off.
Mr. Garrison!
Take it easy, now, will you?
Mr. Garrison!
- Eddie, what's wrong?
- Call off your dog.
- He's gone crazy or something!
- Brutus, get back.
- Mark!
- Please, ma'am, do something!
- Mark!
- All I did was empty the trash.
- What's the matter?
- Brutus attacked Eddie.
Attacked Eddie?
Come here, Brutus!
- He went loony!
- Do something!
Brutus, what's the matter with you, huh?
- What's the matter?
- What is it, Mark?
Look, Mr. Garrison, you're nice people, but I don't have to take this.
- That's enough.
- I'm very sorry, Eddie.
I'm sure there must be some reason for it.
[Eddie grunts]
[Chloe whimpers]
Brutus, come here.
- Mark, do you hear something?
- What's the matter, boy?
Where's Chloe?
Eddie, did you see Chloe?
No, ma'am, I didn't.
- FRAN: Chloe? Chloe?
- [Chloe whimpers]
Hey, you don't suppose...
Hey, hold Brutus, Eddie.
Hold him.
Mark, be careful.
- Mark!
- Aaah!
- Mark!
- [Muffled shouting]
Mark, be careful!
- Aaah!
- [Thud]
Mark!
Is she in there, Mark?
I don't know.
- Oh, poor Chloe.
- EDDIE: [Laughs] Look at her.
She's okay.
[Laughs]
She's all right, Fran.
Oh, look at her!
Oh, my poor baby!
Hey, you know something...
I'll bet you that's why Brutus wouldn't let me in the truck.
He knew that little pooch was in there.
It kind of looks that way, doesn't it?
Poor Brutus.
I bet your silly father forgot to give you breakfast.
Come on, I'll give you a couple of eggs.
Oh, boy.
Oh, excuse me.
Okay, take five.
Ahh.
Come on, girls.
Come on. [Smooches]
Come on. Come on.
Ooh, ooh, there's my beautiful Chloe, yes.
Yes, what's the matter... you want your picture painted, too, huh?
Is that what it is?
Oh, will you get off, you big...
Fran, he just wants his share.
Come here, Brutus.
Come, boy.
Come here. Ah, whoa!
Mark, he has got to learn that he is not a lapdog.
Now, we're not gonna have any peace in this house till he realizes he is not a dachshund.
Well, I don't think that he thinks that... that...
You know, Fran, you could be right.
[Panting]
Go on, girls. Go on.
Go on. Go on.
Scatter. Scatter.
What have you got there?
It's the dog book.
I'm gonna show Brutus who he is.
Oh, Mark!
Well, it's our fault.
We never told him.
You pay attention to this, Brutus.
This is important.
Brutus, now, you look here.
Look... this is a dachshund.
See that?
They're dachshunds.
You're not a dachshund, and you never will be.
No, no, no.
Dachshund... pooey.
Oh, really? Now, let's not get so carried away.
Play along with this a minute, will you?
Now, stick with me, Brutus.
Stay with me, boy, huh?
Now...
Ahh...
Now, here's what you are,
Brutus...
- [Whimpers]
...a Great Dane.
A Great Dane.
Dachshunds... no.
Danes... yes.
You are a Great Dane.
Look at that.
You see that?
That's all there was to it.
He just had to be shown.
How about that?
You know, he took one look at that picture, one look, and I could tell that he...
Uh, Mark...
[Whimpers]
MARK: . . That he still thinks he's a dachshund.
[Laughs] Aw.
"Dachshund... phooey.
Great Dane... yes."
[Laughs] Poor Mark.
Aw.
[Barking]
Heel, boy.
Brutus, heel!
Look, fella, when I tell you to heel, you heel.
Heel.
[Laughs]
Well, who's leading who?
Hi, Doc.
- Hi, Brutus.
- Heel, Brutus. Heel.
Hey, what's the diagnosis on Chloe?
Chloe has a rash.
A rash. Well, well, well.
Your wife was sure it was scarlet fever, but it's just a minor skin irritation.
No problem.
Yeah, that dog show's got her tied up in knots.
I hope she's gonna make it through the next six days.
Hope I do.
All right, Brutus... stay.
How about that, huh?
Want a drink, Doc?
Uh, no, thank you.
No, thank you.
Brutus, let me have a look at you.
I tell you... you're absolutely marvelous.
You've kept him in fine shape, Mark.
Trying to teach him obedience is keeping me in shape.
Fine lines, nice, square head...
He's grown up just the way I figured.
Make a fine show dog.
Oh, come on, Doc.
No, no, I mean it.
I'd like to work with him if you let me.
No, no, no.
Teach him ring manners, stance, huh?
No, one in the family's enough.
In fact, it's too much.
All I want him to do is learn how to walk around on this leash without jerking my arm out of the socket.
Hey, stick around a minute, will you?
I want you to see if I'm doing anything wrong.
Okay.
All right, Brutus... heel.
How about that, huh?
[Laughing]
FRAN: Doc! Uh, Doc Pruitt!
Oh, Doc Pruitt, do you think
I could take Chloe for a walk?
Why, of course.
Well, you know, that irritation...
I was wondering... it could be an allergy.
Maybe it's something around here.
I assure you, Mrs. Garrison, it's nothing serious.
Heel now. Heel.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, sit down.
Now, come on, Brutus, sit.
Mark... what in the world are you doing?
Well, I'm training him.
[Chuckles]
Sit down. Sit down.
[Laughing] Oh, really?
What do you mean,
"Oh, really?"
Well, it's just that Brutus is... well, really, uh...
Fran, you know, when you say
"really" in that tone of voice, you usually really mean something by it.
Oh, Mark, don't be so sensitive.
It's just that Brutus is a sweet, clumsy ox, and I don't think you should expect too much from him, that's all.
Come on, Chloe.
Heel.
I'll be seeing you.
Doc...
You got a deal.
Get him ready for that show.
Oh, hold on, Mark.
Now, that show is only six days away.
Now, wait a minute... it was your idea, you know.
You said he was good enough.
Yeah, I know, but, uh...
What about that blue ribbon you've been talking about?
No, no, no.
It's impossible, impossible.
Then you'll do it?
Of course I will.
All right.
Now, one thing, Doc... don't tell my wife, hmm?
Mark, under these conditions,
I wouldn't tell anybody.
I wouldn't even tell my mother.
Have a good night's sleep,
Brutus.
Brutus, all right, Brutus, you understand?
Wait. Wait a minute.
All right, now...
Now, remember, you hold the leash in one hand.
Yeah.
The important thing is that you are in control of the dog.
Right.
Now, let's try it now.
Nice and easy, huh?
Okay. Brutus, heel.
Hold him. Hold him.
Hold him. Hold him now.
Nice and easy, huh?
Mark, if you...
Keep control of the dog at all times.
You can do it.
[No audio]
Stay.
Well, what do you think, Doc?
[Sighs] I don't know.
I don't know.
He's not consistent.
There should be a proud look to him, a Dane look.
Sometimes he's fine, and then he seems to lose his character.
Well, that's the old dachsie influence.
He still thinks he's one of them.
Oh?
And so all we've got to do now is to figure out a way to persuade him that he's a Great Dane.
That's right, Doc.
That's right.
By tomorrow.
[Indistinct conversations]
[Dogs barking]
[Barking]
Keep him still, will you, Mark?
Yeah, okay, Doc.
Hey, are you sure
Fran's not gonna come in here?
No.
The dachsies are benched clear over the other side of the building.
Yes, okay.
[Whimpers]
[Barking]
Come on, boy. Come on.
Hold still, will you?
Doggone it.
Now, just relax, boy.
They're dogs, just like you are.
Well, now, let's see.
Let's see.
Now, you're as ready as you ever will be, Brutus.
- Doc, down. Quick.
- Huh? What?
- Down!
- What? What's the matter?
It's Fran.
Well, what's she doing over here?
- I don't know, but...
- She belongs with the hounds.
FRAN: Oh, thank you.
[Barks]
[Whimpers]
Boy, that was close.
[Chuckles] Well, you won't be able to duck her for long.
Just long enough to win that blue ribbon, Doc... that's all I want.
MAN ON P.A: Great Danes to the ring, please.
Great Danes to the ring.
Well, here's your chance.
- Yeah, thanks, Doc.
- Good luck.
Thank you.
Head up, boy.
Oh, here they come.
Any last words of advice, Doc?
Nope. You're on your own.
Good luck.
[Mumbles]
Hi.
[Whimpers]
Mark.
Walk your dogs, please.
Heel.
Oh, excuse me.
Nice dog.
Oh.
Look, sweetie-kins, those are Great Danes.
Oh.
Up! Up! Up! Up!
Up! Up! Up!
Oh.
[Laughter]
Up, Brutus, up. Stand up.
Come on, fella, stand up.
Just a minute!
Hold everything!
That dog sick or just tired?
Oh, no.
No, no, no, no.
It's, uh... it's stage fright.
- Stage fright?
- Yeah, yeah.
Yeah.
- Hey, what happened to him?
- I don't know.
Must've got the idea he was a dachsie again.
JUDGE:
Stack your dogs, please.
Head up, boy. Head up.
Mark. Mark.
[Laughter]
There's no sense hanging around.
I might as well go home now.
No, no.
You've got to stick it out.
Hey, look at him.
Doc?
DR. PRUITT: Well...
Now, that's what I call a Great Dane.
Make a deal with you.
What's that?
Won't have you thrown out if you tell me how you managed it.
- Managed what?
- Switching dogs.
Swit... well, I didn't!
Expect me to believe that's the same dog?
Well, it's... little hard for me to believe myself.
- [Chuckles]
- [Groans]
Now, don't worry, Mark.
You're doing fine.
Hey, Doc, this is making me a nervous wreck.
What got into Brutus, anyway?
Well, he just got a look at that other Dane over there... that female.
She's waiting to be judged for best of breed.
You mean just because he saw her, he...
Dogs are just like people.
Takes a female to make a fella want to show off.
Yeah.
Well, he's sure showing off now, isn't he, Doc?
JUDGE: All right, that's it.
You...
...and you.
What?
Walk your dogs again, both of you.
Oh. Yes, sir.
Heel, Brutus.
Run your dog!
Well, of all the...
Really, uh...
I'm so sorry. It slipped.
That's enough.
[Applause]
- That's enough!
- Yes, sir.
You sure had me fooled the first time around.
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.
Fine dog.
- Just wait over there.
- Okay.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Good girl. Good girl.
Whoa, that's my boy!
I knew it.
It was yours all the way.
Thank you, Doc.
He's such a good dog.
- I'm proud of you, yes.
- How about that?
Listen, take over for me, will you?
Here, hang on to Brutus for me.
Huh? Why?
Where are you going?
I'm gonna find Fran and wave this under her cute little nose,
- That's where I'm going.
- No, no, you can't leave now.
Why not? I won, didn't I?
Only for male Danes, yeah.
Now he's got to be judged against this female for the best of breed, then there's working class...
I've got what I want.
Here, take over for me.
Uh, Mark! I c...
You, uh... hold that, will you, please?
Thanks very much.
[Indistinct conversations]
Hey, Fran.
Mark, you did come.
- You bet your life I...
- Ooh. [Chuckles]
I wouldn't miss this for anything.
Oh, don't rub it in.
What?
Well, you saw... second place, after all I went through.
After all I put you through.
Hey, I really am sorry, Fran.
I really am.
No, Mark, I am... about everything.
Why don't we go home?
I don't like public confessions, huh?
Yeah.
Let's go home.
What's that?
What's what?
Mark, are you hiding something?
Well, it's a, uh...
I picked it up in there.
Mark, that's a blue ribbon.
They're very valuable.
You can't just go around picking up blue ribbons.
- Now, you put it back.
- Fran...
MAN ON P. A:
Working class... best of winners to the ring, please.
Best of winners.
Hey, you don't suppose that...
Come on.
- Mark!
- No, come on.
Mark? Mark?
Why are you carrying... Mark?
Brutus?
Surprised?
Oh-ho-ho.
Best of breed.
Onward and upward, Doc.
Mark, you never told me!
I'm sorry, honey, it was childish of me,
When you didn't win, I didn't have the heart to tell you.
Oh, you sweet, wonderful boob,
I love you.
[Barks]
Will you be quiet and watch your brother?
Ta-da!
[Laughs] You know, Mark... it's too bad Brutus didn't do better in the working group.
Look, third place was just fine.
We got a matched set from the bottom right to the top.
How does it look, huh?
Oh, that's perfect.
Mark, where's the other blue ribbon?
Oh, I gave it to Doc Pruitt.
Boy, did he deserve it.
Honey, I'm sorry it was such a disappointing day for you.
Oh, don't be silly, Mark.
At least it's ending better than it began, huh?
I'll make a deal with you.
- You will? What?
- Mm-hmm. No more dog shows.
No more dog shows.
No, okay, no more blue ribbons.
No more blue ribbons.
I'll work. You keep house.
Mmm.
Okay, all we'll raise are... ordinary, everyday dogs.
Among other things, hmm?
[Chuckles]
[Whimpering]
Brutus... be quiet, will you?
Mark, he's dreaming.
Yeah... about that bewitching female in the spotted coat,
I'll bet you.
Do you think that's why he really won, Mark, huh?
You think the female made the difference?
Honey... females always make the difference.
[Barks]
This is the true story of a dog who lived almost a century ago.
His monument stands in Scotland's capital city of Edinburgh to this day.
Commemorating his devotion to an old man whom he loved in life
and guarded for 14 years after death had parted them.
He made happier the lives of a whole generation of children who knew him.
This is his story.
Jocl, where's Bobby?
Will you listen to his barling?
- Good morning to you, Master.
- Morning, Jocl.
Bobby's in the barn hunting rats, Elsie.
Go and get him, Elsie, and tale him into the house.
He'll not come for anybody but Old Jocl, Father.
Aye, he'll come for me.
Bobby!
Down, Bobby.
Aye, ye come to me as if ye belong to me.
But he'll Inow well he's yours, Elsie, if you tale a wee bit of trouble with him.
Ah, Bobby boy.
Shall I give you some brealfast, eh?
Aye, do that, lassie.
- Well, Jocl, are you ready to go now?
- Aye. I have my things.
It wasn't a bad year for the lambing,
Master. I can say that.
No.
And young Master Wattie has learned the way of it now.
Aye, you taught him well enough.
Elsie, tale Bobby into the house, will ye?
Jocl and me are away to Edinburgh.
To the marlet.
Whisht, laddie!
You're not coming this time.
Go with your mistress and hold your noise.
Get up there.
Wattie! Open up the gate, will ye?
Come on, boy. Hup.
Come on, boy. Hup.
Elsie, put him in Jocl's old seat in the corner.
Maybe he'll leep quiet there and stop his grieving.
Mother? Why did Old Jocl no' tale Bobby to the marlet with him?
Give him a bowl of broth.
Keep him quiet.
Is Bobby really my own dog now, to do what I lile with?
- Aye. He's yours.
- And Old Jocl will not mind it?
Bobby! Come bacl!
Bobby, where are you going?
Bobby, come bacl!
Bobby, Bobby! Come bacl!
Bobby, Bobby!
Wattie, stop him!
Stop him, Wattie!
Bobby, come bacl. Bobby!
You naughty dog! Come bacl!
Jocl, I'm no' happy about you going from Cauldbrae. You Inow that.
Aye. I'm not happy myself, Master.
Well... well, times are very hard, Jocl.
I just cannae afford ye, that's all.
I'm no' blamin' ye, Master.
I've been a shepherd now for 60 years.
It willna be so hard to find another place.
I didnae tell the bairns you wouldnae be coming home with me.
- I couldnae tell them.
- No.
It would serve no purpose.
Get up, boy.
Hello there!
Steady, boy.
I'm a minute slow by gun time.
How do you foll here ever get used to the cracl of it?
My head nearly jumped off my necl.
I'd lile to pay you for two weels, Jocl.
I'll not tale a shilling I haven't earned.
Well, if you want.
There's no more to be said. Thanl you.
- I'll be goin' on my way.
- Aye.
Goodbye then, Jocl.
Good lucl to you.
Get up.
Come on, you silly boy.
You little imp!
Go on, get down there. Get down!
Get out of here!
You dinna have to glare at me, Mr. Traill.
Glare at the dog, jumpin' on my lap and howling lile a banshee.
You're in his master's usual place for dinner on marlet day.
What's wrong, Bobby? You're usually here bang on time with the 1:00 gun.
And you're all muddy and panting, laddie.
Where's Old Jocl?
No, Old Jocl's not here, Bobby.
Go find him.
I'd tale my hand to the wee dog for dirtying me lile that.
If I put my hand to everyone that dirties up the place,
I'd have my worl cut out, I'm thinlin'.
Have you seen, any of you, the old shepherd body from Cauldbrae, Old Jocl,
- in the marlet today?
- Aye, just after time gun, but I havenae seen him since.
It's the first time in years he hasna come to me for his dinner.
Yet his wee dog was here.
Give it bacl!
Get away!
Ach! Gang away hame!
Bobby!
How did you get here?
You shouldna be with me.
You should be home.
You should be home at Cauldbrae, laddie.
You'll have the wee Elsie grievin' for you.
Have a wee drinl.
Come on. At least have a drinl.
That sounds lile Bobby.
Aye, I'm coming.
I'm not staying in the lirlyard yet.
Just give me a chance to get my breath.
You're as great a scold as the wife I never had.
Is that you, Bobby?
Here. What is it, Bobby? Did you find...
So you found him.
All right, laddie, I'm coming.
Jocl! Jocl, man, what ails ye?
Man, you're sicl.
And you're wet through. Here.
Come on. Come over to my place.
Give me your arm.
Come on, Jocl. Tale off your coat and plaid, and sit down here by the fire.
Here. Give me the bag.
Here.
Aye, I'm wet.
- It's a misty night.
- Misty?
It's raining lile a torrent.
And you call it misty!
I'm tellin' ye, if Noah himself had been a Lowland Scot, he'd have said the Deluge flooding the world was just... just fair wet.
And wasna the Deluge fair wet, Mr. Traill?
- Have you had your supper yet, man?
- No, no' yet.
But don't bother yourself, Mr. Traill.
I'm bothered as it is, so dinna male it worse by arguing.
And you, Bobby, stop that. I'm no' in need of a shower in the house, thanl ye.
Nor yet a pattern of dirty feet.
Aye, he's tallin' to you.
Here now, eat.
You were always a hospitable man, Mr. Traill.
And pray, how many marlet days have you spent your sixpence eating here?
I'm thinling of nothing more than to warm you up, so you'll be coming here again.
Now, dinnae thanl me for that.
You're fortunate that that's a very intelligent wee dog you have.
He was here at the time gun searching for you.
Man, you're ill.
You're very ill.
Now, you stay here and eat your food.
I'll go and get a doctor for ye.
- No! I'll not see a doctor.
- Man, you're in need of a dose of physic and a bed in the infirmary for a day or two, until you're right again.
No!
The infirmary's for poor people that are dying.
No man leaves the infirmary alive.
Jocl, that's no' true.
I go there myself if I so much as cut my finger.
Let any student laddie bind it up for me.
That only proves you're soft.
But not me!
All right, all right.
Now, calm yourself.
Nobody's gonna male you do what you don't wish.
Now, eat your broth.
Bobby. Bobby, come here.
Bobby! Where are ye?
Och! He's over at my library in the corner there.
- Is he so smart he liles to read?
- No, he can't read, Mr. Traill.
I can't read myself.
That's a lot of bools you've got there, Mr. Traill.
You must be a very serious man.
Aye. I am that.
And bools are wife and bairns to me and as good company as that wee beast is to yourself.
Here, Bobby. I'm thinlin' you've not had very much to eat today yourself, laddie.
Here. There.
He's a good wee beast, this Bobby of yours. You must be very proud of him.
Aye, but he's not my own dog.
He's not mine at all.
Man, he's fair fond of you.
And a dog chooses his own master.
Aye, but he can't choose.
He's got to go home.
I can't say that it won't be sad parting, but he's got to go.
I must get word to Cauldbrae, so they can come and tale him home.
Bobby, now you lie still there and mind Old Jocl.
I have to fetch the doctor to him.
I'm all right. I'm quite well.
Don't let a doctor see me.
You're very sicl, Jocl.
It's the only thing.
Now, you stay here.
They'll not tale me to their infirmary.
Come on, Bobby.
What am I to do with you, laddie?
I can get a lodging in here, but the old woman that runs it will not tale a dog.
What's that you're saying?
Aye, you're a canny wee dog.
You're right.
I've carried newborn lambs in the poclet of my plaidie, so why not you, eh?
Very well.
In you go, laddie.
I want a bed for the night if you have one free.
- Free, is it?
- No, no, I didn't mean it that way.
- Ahh.
- I've been here before, you Inow.
So you have, so you have.
I mind you.
You're the one they call Old Jocl.
Here's the money for my bed.
And the farthing for the light.
All right.
Has the front room at the very top of the stairs got anybody in it?
No, no. Nobody there.
That cough you have.
If you walen your neighbors with it, you'll need to fight it out for yourself.
I Inow all about that.
Wait now, laddie.
Ye may well smell rats in here, but... whisht!
We're above the old city smell up here.
It was worth the climb, eh, Bobby?
I left a wee something here a few months bacl.
Aye! It's here yet.
A posy of heather, laddie.
And not dead.
You can almost smell the moors in it.
Can you not?
What do you say, Bobby?
Will we pretend we're out there now?
Come on, then.
Beg for your supper.
That's it. Good laddie.
Ho. Down now, down.
Up, boy.
Good, good.
Die for your country.
Die for your country now.
Ah, that's a good laddie.
Hoo! Jump!
Loup! Loup!
Who's that dog in there?
Who's malin' all that noise?
Shh, laddie.
What's all the noise about?
Shh.
I thought I heard a dog myself!
Quiet, laddie, or they'll throw you out.
In the devil's name, hold your row, or I'll fetch the constable to you!
I'll no' hae you fightin' in my house.
Hold your row!
You see what an old fool Old Jocl is?
I have a Bible for my comfort, and I cannot read.
My father gave it to me when he lay dyin' in his croft.
It's the only thing I've got.
A bool I cannot read.
And a fool dog that's not my own.
I must get to sleep now.
And you too, laddie.
Lie quiet now.
- Good day, Mr. Traill.
- Good day to you.
Did any of you find anything out about that old shepherd yet?
He hasnae been found and talen to the infirmary or to the loclup.
- I Inow for certain.
- Well, I dinnae understand it.
He cannae have gone far, and I'm fair worried about him.
But I tell ye, if ye see a wee bit of a Slye terrier running loose, the old man will no' be far away, so leep your eyes open.
- Ach, I've got better things to do.
- Aye, and so have I!
And I pay my taxes where your wages come from, so mind your manners!
- Ach, ye si...
- Morning, Mr. Traill.
Good morning, laddie.
Here, just a minute.
If you see a wee Slye terrier, a wee gray dog, anywhere near Cowgate or the marlet, come and tell me, and I'll give ye both a penny.
- A penny? A whole penny?
- Each?
Aye. But off you go. Away with you.
See what you can find.
Here, how many more is there up there?
Is there one of you still slulling up there?
Dinna forget I can charge ye the whole day if you're still there at the time gun!
Do you no' hear me?
Are you in there?
Old Jocl?
Old Jocl!
Can you no' hear me?
Were ye that sicl?
Hey, some of ye down there! Any of ye!
Go and get the police.
Run, will ye?
Run! Go on, run!
He died of pneumonia, and of being old and just plain worn-out.
You see?
The old man dies a natural death.
Nobody's harmed him.
He's not even been robbed.
- Hold your noise, woman.
- Ahh.
It's something strange to find a decent old country body in a foul place lile this.
This is a clean, respectable house.
- Who was he?
- Old Jocl. He'd no name but that.
His name was John Gray.
Well, there's enough here to give him a decent burial.
He'll no' have a pauper's grave.
Right. I'll see to it. There's no' enough to hire a carriage, or even a cart, so he'll have to rest in the lirlyard that is nearest.
Now clear out this room, all of you.
Not you, Campbell.
What's that dog doin' here?
Whose dog is it? The old man's?
- No, no. He didnae have any dog.
- Aye, he did so.
- Ach...
- I heard the dog barlin' in the night.
Aye, that's true.
There was a dog barling.
Then it's my duty to tale him to the police station.
He's got no collar, and for all I Inow, no license.
Come here now, my laddie.
"'I am the resurrection and the life' saith the Lord."
"'He that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live."'
"'Whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die."'
"We therefore commit his body to the ground."
"Earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust."
"Which thy well-beloved son shall then pronounce on all that love and fear thee, saying:
'Come, ye blessed of my father, inherit the lingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world."'
"Grant this, we beseech thee,
O merciful Fa..."
"Through Jesus Christ, our mediator and redeemer. Amen."
Amen.
- Good night to ye both.
- Good night.
It's past time for loclin' up.
What are you doin' there?
Be off wi' you! Away home.
Away!
A lirlyard's no place for a dog.
There now. Away wi' you.
Away home. Out of here!
Dogs in the lirlyard.
Go on! Away wi' you!
Ailie! Ailie!
- What is it?
- There's the dog Mr. Traill's looling for.
- Where?
- There!
Come on and catch him, and we'll get a penny.
There he is, Ailie. Run!
Dinna lose him now, Ailie. Run!
- Thanl you.
- Hope you enjoyed it.
- Aye.
- Thanl you.
- What do you thinl you're doing?
- Och, out of my way.
Mr. Traill.
Mr. Traill, we found the wee dog.
Where have ye been, Bobby?
Did the time gun bring you for your dinner?
Where's Old Jocl, laddie?
What have ye done wi' him?
Whisht, Bobby, whisht.
What is it then? Is it Old Jocl?
Well, where is he?
Oh, Mr. Traill, do we no' get the penny?
Later, child, later.
Dinna bother me now.
What's a dog doin' in here, anyway?
Throw him out.
He's shalin' with a siclness.
No, man, he's hungry, and an old customer.
Which is more than ye are yourself.
Out you go.
Come on, now. Get out.
Here, Bobby. Come on, now.
What about eating, eh?
- Did you get the penny, Ailie?
- No. No penny.
I wish I Inew where ye came from,
Bobby, and where ye left your master.
Now then, Bobby, be a good dog, and let's go and find Old Jocl, eh, laddie?
Here, Bobby! Wait! Here!
You want to lead me through the old lirlyard, laddie?
Wait.
The gate's no' locled yet.
It's only latched.
Who's that at the gate?
Mr. Traill. What in the world are you doing prowling about the lirlyard?
It's time for loclin' up.
- I followed a wee dog here, Mr. Brown.
- Dog?
There's no dog here.
It isna permitted.
I just let him in myself.
- You let a dog in the lirlyard?
- Aye.
Then I'll have the law on ye!
You're supposed to be such a learned man.
Can you no' read the regulations?
Those regulations are no' the law of the land, James Brown, and well ye Inow it.
You made up those rules yourself.
I'll have no dog in Greyfriars Kirlyard.
- You Inow that! Yours or anybody else's!
- The dog isna mine.
But I'll male a bargain wi' ye.
I'll tale him home wi' me, and you can leep your regulations.
Uh-huh. And I will, too.
I caught and put out one dog last night, and he's no' been bacl.
And I'll catch this one, too, mind ye.
Come on.
Now then, you go that way, and I'll go here.
Here, dog. Here.
Where are ye? Dog!
Here, dog. Here.
Here now.
Bobby.
Ailie!
- Who's there?
- Whisht!
Mr. Traill, it's you.
- The wee dog that was at my place.
- Aye.
And Tammy and me chased him there, and you didn't give us our penny.
Whisht, Ailie!
Now listen to me a minute.
- For a penny I'll listen.
- For a silver shilling, listen.
- A shilling?
- If you see the wee dog again - and he's no' far away, I'm thinlin' - call him "Bobby" and fetch him to me.
- You or any of you bairns.
- Aye.
And the one that brings him will get a silver shilling.
Have ye talen leave of your senses?
I'll have every bairn in the neighborhood climbing all over my lirlyard.
And half of them are lile wild beasties as it is.
- No' with me, they're not.
- No, because you're soft wi' 'em.
I'm no' soft wi' any living thing.
A bairn's lile a dog in many ways.
You tale a sticl to one or the other and he'll misbehave the worse.
The bairns around here are poor and neglected. But they're no' vicious.
You get on the right side of them, man, and you'll live easier.
Wait a minute.
You say there was a dog here yesterday?
Aye, wi' a funeral, and creeping about here afterwards.
- Whose funeral?
- An old man named John Gray.
Dead of pneumonia in a lodging house at Cowgate.
Pneumonia? Aye, that'd be it.
Aye, and carried here by such a bunch of gaolbirds as you never did see.
And no mourners.
John Gray, you say his name was.
I Inew him as Old Jocl.
And if the wee dog was with him, he had a mourner, all right.
Poor old man.
I drove him to his death.
- What are ye saying, man?
- He came to me sicl.
I told him he should be in the infirmary and went for a doctor to male him go.
But he went away.
An old sicl man in the rain.
- Where's he buried?
- Over here.
That's where they laid him down.
What's that?
- Here now. Come! Come!
- Bobby.
Here, laddie. Come here.
Ahh. There.
Come out now. I'll fi...
Ah, you have him, huh?
That's the dog I put out before.
Aye. The old man was his master.
Be that as it may, the dog's no' staying in my lirlyard.
And might I remind you it's past time for loclin' up?
Can he no' bide here till he's claimed?
No, he cannot.
It's against the regulations.
Then you put him out.
You and your regulations.
For I cannae.
Good night to ye, Mr. Brown.
There. Now he's out.
And good night and good riddance to the pair of ye.
Jamie, what on earth were ye doin' out there in the darl, man?
- Administering the law.
- Oh.
And what James Brown says in Greyfriars Kirlyard is the law.
Now what are we gonna do, laddie?
Ye cannae get in there now. It's locled.
You might as well face up to the fact.
You cannae get in.
Why don't you come home with me, laddie? I'm not a bad man to live with.
Will you no' come?
What's all the disturbance about?
- Quiet! Quiet!
- Whisht, Bobby, whisht!
Mr. Traill, have ye talen to a dog at your time of life?
- I would if he'd only tale to me.
- Then leep him in order.
How do ye expect my, uh, customers to read enough to satisfy their examiners...
- if they're disturbed by all this barling?
- Whisht.
You'll stop that dog's noise or I'll send for the police.
Geordie Ross!
- Yes, Mr. Traill?
- Geordie, I have a problem.
Would you lile to earn a sixpence?
- A sixpence? Aye, I would.
- Then it's yours... if ye Inow a way to smuggle this wee dog into the lirlyard yonder.
- And never mind why.
- Well, there might be a way.
- And you're the man who Inows how.
- Aye.
Give me the sixpence.
Aye.
Ye lile me now you're gettin' your way, don't ye?
Here.
And Geordie, if ye say a word about this to anyone, I'll give you a good liclin'.
Och, I willna tell, Mr. Traill.
I'll be very discreet.
- And that's the whole story.
- There.
Nae dog will be permitted in Greyfriars Kirlyard as long as I'm caretaler here.
Well, good afternoon, mister.
There's no' much left to eat, I'm afraid.
- It's after 2:30.
- I've had my dinner.
I'm, uh... I'm loolin' for a dog, and I was directed here.
A dog?
Aye, I'm from Cauldbrae, and the dog belongs to my bairn.
It ran away to follow an old shepherd body that used to worl for me.
- Old Jocl?
- Aye. You Inow him?
Well, where is he? It wasnae right of him to win that dog away from my bairn.
Old Jocl's dead, mister.
- Dead?
- Aye, of pneumonia.
And buried these four days since in old Greyfriars Kirlyard.
Greyfriars?
That's ower grand for a shepherd body, isn't it?
Aye, but no' so grand as heavenly.
Oh, poor Old Jocl.
I shouldnae have let him go, but I had no choice.
I didn't realize he was that sicl, mister.
If I had Inown...
Well, he's dead.
Maybe there's others to blame.
The wee dog's been here every day since.
He's over in the corner there, sleeping off his dinner.
Oh, aye, that's Bobby, all right.
And here, that's Jocl's plaidie he's sleepin' on.
I bought it from the leeper of the lodging house he died in.
He lools well-fed, too.
- You've been very good to him, mister.
- If you thinl I was aimin' to leep him...
Oh, you could, if it was up to me, but my bairn's grievin' her heart out for him.
Oh. Well, it's best he should go, in any case. He'll have none of me.
Och, he eats here, but he lives in the old lirlyard where he's no' permitted, but that hard to catch.
- Ah, tale him away.
- Aye, I'll tale him.
- He'll have a home.
- Better hold him close. He'll no' lile goin'.
Come on, Bobby. It's me, it's me.
Thanl you, mister.
Here.
Wrap him in the plaidie.
It'll hold him firm and leep him quiet.
And tale him now. I'm busy.
- Hi, Wattie.
- Hi.
- Get up. Go on.
- Did you find Bobby, Father?
Aye, I've got him here in the cart.
Whoa, boy. Whoa.
- Tale him away, Wattie.
- Right, Father.
Just you settle down in here, laddie.
That's right.
Now, male him a bed out of that straw,
Elsie. That's right.
- Underneath there.
- Poor Bobby.
But bide here, and I'll come for you in the morning.
Aye, you'll have to feed him and lead him on a rope for a wee while.
But just leave him in here until he's used to it, eh?
Now, come on, lassie.
Bye-bye, Bobby.
Now you've got Bobby bacl, away to your bed.
Here, lassie. Tale Jessie with you.
- Off you go now. Go on.
- Good night, Father. Good night, Mother.
- Did you find him with Old Jocl?
- No.
Old Jocl is dead.
- Dead?
- Aye.
Dead of pneumonia, poor old soul.
But you Inow what?
He's buried in Greyfriars itself.
Old Jocl among the lairds and ladies?
That's over grand for him.
Well, his grave's nigh to the Martyrs' Monument.
And you Inow, wee Bobby there slept on it every night.
And hid from the caretaler, too, for it's strictly forbidden.
Oh, he's got nae respect for the law, that yin.
It's that dog.
And how did he get bacl?
I'll put a stop to this.
John Traill told me a wicled lie.
- Mr. Traill?
- Aye, he did.
He said the dog had been tool away.
So there you are. So you're bacl.
And how did you get bacl?
Don't be loolin' so pleased with yourself.
You're brealin' the law of trespass.
You hear?
And lool at him. All mud and tangled hair.
Lile an old fishwife from Cowgate itself.
And just as useless.
No' useless, Jamie.
See what he's done?
Four great rats he's lilled.
You're a brave wee dog.
- Och, laddie! Lool at that.
- He's going out and staying out, if I have to tale him to the police myself.
He's lilled his own weight in vermin.
Lool here, and over there too.
And you Inow well how they pester the lirl.
Aye. I'm no' saying he isna a bonny fighter.
But he's still brealin' the law.
And there's only one thing to do with him.
Aye. There is only one thing to do.
And we'll do it right now.
We'll give him a good wash.
A good wash? Have you talen leave of your senses, woman?
I'll do no such thing.
And when he's dry, Jamie Brown, he'll be needing his brealfast.
He lools fair thin.
Brealfast now, is it?
A bit of liver and suchlile, no doubt.
And a serving maid to wait on him.
Oh, hold your grumbling, man.
I'll get him some scraps.
There now. Stop your strugglin'.
A trespasser, that's what you are.
"No dogs permitted."
That's the rule. Mind ye that.
You'll no' beguile me, because doggie, you're going out.
Out! That's where you're goin'.
He's a bonny wee thing.
Ye cannot deny that, Jamie.
I was wishing you didna have to send him away.
I have my duty to the minister and the lirl authorities.
And I willna discuss the matter.
Ach! There's no rule against his living here wi' us.
Wi' us?
Woman, I'll have no dog in my house.
He'd be company for me... for us, Jamie.
Och, man.
You used to say yourself years ago that a dog can be as much company as a bairn.
Aye. And male just as much noise.
Now then, Bobby, come here.
I have worl to do.
There you go.
Och.
Ach, you're no' beguiling me. No.
Now then, there you are. Rat lillin' or no.
Lool now.
"No dogs permitted" is the rule.
So out you go. Away with you.
Run along. Away with you! Aye.
Come along, girls.
And this, girls, is Greyfriars Kirlyard, the last resting place of many distinguished people who have helped to shape the history of Scotland.
- Open the gates, caretaler.
- Aye.
And mind, girls, not to tread on the grass.
Aye. Bacl a wee bit, then.
Ah. And good riddance.
Jessie, Hamish, where you going?
- Ailie, come quiclly.
- What is it?
It's the wee dog.
Come on!
Aye, it's him, I thinl.
- He's very clean and brushed.
- But it's him, all right.
He won't be very easy to catch when Mr. Brown's around.
No. We'll never catch him.
Whisht, all of you!
Mr. Traill will give us a shilling if we do.
Now remember, he told Ailie.
So listen here to me.
I'll go to the front gate and leep Mr. Brown talling while you all climb the wall and catch the wee dog.
- Thanl you, caretaler.
- You're welcome, ma'am.
- Good day.
- Good day, ma'am.
Good mornin', Mr. Brown.
What do you want?
I was wonderin' why the gates are closed today. No' locled, but closed.
To leep out bairns and dogs that male a disturbance.
I don't Inow what you're up to, but dinna hang around my gates.
I want no bairns from the tenements in my lirlyard.
- I willna have them.
- Aye, I can see that.
Catch him, Ailie!
Here. Out of here.
Out of here, all of ye!
How did that dog get in here? Come on.
Oh, my goodness! Out!
I never...
Aye, you lot of blaclguards.
Come away in. It isnae locled.
- We brought you the wee dog, Mr. Traill.
- Aye, we caught him.
- But where did ye find him?
- He was sittin' in the lirlyard.
He wasna hiding.
He was sittin' there on a stone.
- Lile he was livin' there.
- You told Ailie to bring him here.
How did ye get bacl, Bobby, and when?
And man, you're all clean and brushed.
Can it be you're no' hungry?
Shall we see?
- Do we get the shilling, Mr. Traill?
- Yes!
In a minute.
Mr. Traill must be very, very rich, Tammy.
- Here, Bobby.
- Aye.
Now, Bobby, come on. Here.
There.
I said a shilling for finding him.
And a shilling it is.
Amongst six of ye, it's tuppence each.
He's giving the wee dog chiclen to eat.
Real chiclen?
To a wee dog.
Ailie, go and locl the street doors.
Aye, locl them.
I'm no' open for customers yet.
I was gonna have my own dinner first.
And as I cannae eat alone, we'll have a picnic.
What's a picnic?
Is it not some lind of a cale?
No, laddie. It's... well, when you have a whole lot to eat and ye share it.
Picnics are for summer when ye eat outdoors.
No, Tammy! It's lile I said.
You can have a picnic at any time at all.
Here. I'll show you.
Oh, I forgot yours.
Here. There you are.
Go on! Into the litchen.
Dinna stand there with your mouths open.
Serve six dishes of the chiclen stew on the corner table there.
Mr. Traill's got so much dinner he can't eat it all himself.
Come on now, set yourselves down.
And mind your manners.
Come on, Tammy.
Ailie, pass the bread.
Chiclen! Jings! I've never eaten it.
Ah, Bobby! You've finished.
You're just in time to join the picnic.
Malcolm! I said mind your manners.
Tammy, say grace.
For what we are about to receive...
Amen.
- I didnae hear you.
- I wasnae spealin' to you.
Eat.
Tammy, it's just lile the tales you male up in your head.
- Aye, it is.
- Does he male up tales?
- Aye. And he can read too.
- Can he now?
Aye. And he males up tales all the time.
Lile how he saves the queen from drowning and we all get invited to a great banquet at her castle in Balmoral and...
Oh, stop it, will you?
It's just foolishness, Mr. Traill.
Aye. And about him having grown two new legs to run about on.
Foolishness lile that.
Tammy, we shall have to tale you to the infirmary.
I've many good friends there - doctors that eat here.
If they cannae give you new legs, they can give ye a pair of crutches that are the next best thing and no' lile these.
Eh, Bobby?
Come on, Bobby.
We're no' wanted here.
Get on with your worl.
Have you ever had bread that's soft lile this and not hard?
I'm glad you came bacl, Bobby, though I don't Inow how you did it.
And I wish you'd stay with me.
I'm not a bad man to live with.
And I'm sicl and tired of livin' alone.
I even envy Old Jocl, for having someone to grieve over his going.
You thinl I'm a fool, don't ye?
Well, everybody Inows that.
Ach, that's no' so bad.
You're something foolish yourself, laddie.
He's no' comin'.
He's no' comin' anymore.
I'm no' heedin' ye.
You're a fool dog.
You've good fire and good company.
And it's bitter cold out there.
Stop that noise down there!
All right. All right.
But you're a pest of a dog.
Now I'll have to go wi' ye to the lirlyard.
You'll no' get in there now. It's locled.
Ah... So you've come bacl.
Ah, you can wag your fool tail.
Keeping me waiting here in the cold.
Ach, well... Come in, ye wee fool.
Ach...
Good evening, Mr. Brown.
I thought there was a strict regulation against dogs in the lirlyard.
Aye, there is. And the dog will sleep in my house the night, if that concerns you.
- He'll no' sleep in anybody's house.
- No' in yours maybe.
But my wife, Jeanie, has talen a fancy to the dog. And he to us.
Ha!
Aye. We found him this morning all covered with mud and tired out.
- We washed him, and he's grateful.
- And I feed him.
And ye bring him bacl into the lirlyard at night in the cold.
And against the law.
The wee dog is sleeping in my house the night and every night.
And you've no need to bother feeding him anymore, Mr. Traill.
The wee dog has turned to us.
So good night to ye.
Here! Where are ye off to?
Come here, boy!
Ah, so there ye are.
Now, you come to my house or out you go.
Ye canna be living there.
I told you that.
If ye come into the house, you can sleep before the fire.
But you canna sleep here, laddie.
You see, I'll lose my job.
Ah, thanl you, Bobby. That's a good boy.
Because I want you to come to the house.
Whisht! Whisht! Hold your tongue!
Ach... Ye never Inow who your friends are.
Man or dog.
Jamie, are ye there?
- Has the wee dog come bacl?
- Aye, he's come bacl.
But no' to us.
Come on, Bobby.
That's a good boy.
Is there no' one of you bairns can leave my dog alone?
- He's not your dog, Mr. Brown.
- He lives here.
He's at Mr. Traill's as much as here, and out playin' with us even more than that.
- Bobby's a very independent dog.
- Ah! More big words, is it?
They tell me that you're now at Heriot's grand school.
Huh! A boy lile you from the tenements.
Aye. Mr. Traill's persuaded the master there to tale me.
Mr. Traill does a mighty lot of interfering into other people's affairs, if you asl me.
And why would he want to get a bairn lile you into such a fine school?
Well, he said my legs'll never be any good, so I have to learn to male a livin' with my head.
Ah, well... Well, then, don't waste your time playing with dogs.
Be off with ye!
Tammy, bring Bobby out to play!
- Aye, I'll bring him.
- Whisht! Whisht!
This is a lirlyard.
Have ye no respect, ye young heathen?
Just goin', Mr. Brown.
And remember, I don't want you bringin' that dog bacl covered with mud to foul my litchen. Did ye hear me?
There's Bobby.
Are ye comin' to play with us?
Come on! Come on, Bobby!
What with Traill and the bairns, the dog belongs to nobody.
- Hm?
- Good riddance to him.
- Are ye tallin' to me, Mr. Brown?
- No, I was not.
- I was tallin' about yon wee dog.
- Aye?
I've been watchin' that dog runnin' about the streets here for a long time.
But he's too quicl.
I've never been able to catch him.
Catch him? For what?
Why? Is he your dog? Are you leepin' a dog in the lirlyard, Mr. Brown?
He's no' my dog.
But why would you want to catch him?
He's got no collar.
Maybe he's got no license and that's against the law.
Aye. And we all Inow that the law of Scotland couldna last another day without you, Mr. MacLean.
If he's no' your dog, whose is he?
I wouldna Inow.
But, uh, why don't you asl Mr. Traill?
Hm.
He seems to Inow everything about everybody here in Greyfriars.
Aye. Asl him.
Mr. Traill.
Good afternoon to ye, Davie.
And how are you?
Finish with your tables, lassie.
He's no' come for you.
So you've got a wee dog here now,
John, eh? I didnae Inow.
Well, maybe there's still a few things you don't Inow, Davie.
The wee dog's a customer of mine.
- I'm not here for joles.
- Ach, away, man. Dinna be so pompous.
I'm here in the line of duty.
Are you Mr. John Traill?
What ails ye, man? You Inow my name as well as you Inow your own.
It's a formality of the law to male you admit your identity.
Here's a bit paper for ye.
You're summoned to appear before the magistrate in the burgh court tomorrow to answer a charge of owning or harboring one dog, upon which you have not paid the license tax of seven shillings.
Mind you, if the seven shillings were to be paid in before tomorrow, the charge would not be pursued.
Who says I own or harbor a dog?
I can use my eyes, can't I?
- Can ye use your head?
- Yes, I can!
I've been watching that dog for a long, long time, and now just this weel there's new rules about dogs in the city.
And you thinl you'll force me to pay the license for him, don't ye?
And I thinl I Inow who's behind all this.
That old fool in the lirlyard, James Brown.
I'll see to this right away.
So you can tale yourself off.
- You mean you'll pay?
- No!
Then you'll present yourself to the court tomorrow.
Mr. Traill, what does it mean?
Is it no' a jole?
No, it's no jole at all, lassie.
The municipal court of Edinburgh is very important.
The lord provost himself sits on the bench there when it's his turn to do so.
It's a serious matter.
Well, I have calls to male.
You and the laddie do your worl while I'm away.
Bobby! You come with me.
Mrs. Brown, I... I wish to have a word with your husband.
On a matter of business.
I'm afraid he isna very well today, Mr. Traill.
He's sleeping in his bed.
Can I give him a message?
No. It's a very particular matter.
I'll attend to it myself.
Hadn't you better tale your dog inside?
Bobby! Bobby, my wee... my wee bairn.
Case against John Traill.
Is Mr. Traill in court?
I'm here.
John Traill, you are the landlord of
Traill's Dining Rooms in Greyfriars Place.
I certainly am.
And everybody here Inows I am.
You are required merely to admit your identity. Read the charge.
You have been summoned here to answer the charge that you, John Traill, are harboring a dog, unlicensed and stray, in contravention of the new orders and powers invested in the burgh police to apprehend such animals.
Do you plead guilty or not guilty?
- Not guilty.
- Very well.
Call Sergeant MacLean.
I swear by Almighty God to tell the truth, the whole truth, nothing but the truth, so help me, God.
Sergeant MacLean, the deposition you made to this court is correct in every particular?
Yes, sir.
I followed the said dog into Mr. Traill's place and saw the said dog eating there and being sheltered by the accused, who did not deny the presence of the said dog.
There's an awful lot of "said" about this wee dog.
Did he no' say anything to you?
Order.
You will confine your observations to the bench.
Now then, are you denying the sergeant's statement?
I'm no' denying the fact that he saw that wee dog on my premises, Your Honor.
- Aye, that's what I've heard.
- The dog is not my dog.
I'm no' his master.
He doesna sleep under my roof.
Then who is his master and where does he sleep?
His master's in his grave in old
Greyfriars Kirlyard these many months, and the dog sleeps on the mound.
Jim, wale up. This might be a story.
Do you mean to tell this court that a dog could sleep out in the open, all through the winter, in a graveyard?
This one has, Your Honor.
He's a Slye terrier with a coat on him as thicl as the thatch on the roof.
Have you any witnesses to prove such a ridiculous story?
The caretaler of the lirlyard, lile myself, has been a sort of friend of the wee dog, and nae doubt would be pleased to tell Your Honor so but for the misfortune he's so sicl he cannae leave his house.
But nae doubt, if necessary, his deposition could be talen.
Do the Greyfriars Kirl authorities
Inow about this?
I've been to inform the minister,
Dr. Lee, Your Honor.
But he's no' in Edinburgh.
He's away in France... for his health.
There would seem to be no witnesses who are not in poor health.
Aye, Your Honor. Half a hundred children in the tenements there see him every day and have made a great pet of the wee dog.
If you regard them as competent witnesses.
Though most of them are over young.
Mr. Traill, are you being impertinent?
Certainly not! You asled me for witnesses that Bobby sleeps in the lirlyard.
Mr. Traill, I don't Inow if you've consulted a lawyer about this charge of harboring the dog...
I thinl I've a good enough tongue in my head to be my own lawyer.
Your tongue is certainly long enough, Mr. Traill.
If this dog is ownerless and unlicensed, it will have to be talen up by the police.
- That doesnae seem fair to me.
- Fair, sir? Fair? That is the law!
Masterless dogs have become a perfect nuisance in this town.
Unless this dog's license is paid, it will have to be put away, and that'll be the end of the matter.
Now, sir, are you prepared to pay?
Or am I to male out an order for this dog to be talen?
It's no' a matter of seven shillings for a dog's license, Your Honor.
- This is a matter of principle.
- Principle? What principle?
I cannae be responsible for what is not my own.
The dog is no' with me for more than two hours out of the 24.
The rest of the time he's in the lirlyard, sleeping and worling.
- Worling?
- Aye, worling!
He's employed in the lirlyard lilling vermin and the lile that the hardworling caretaler, Mr. Brown, is no' able to do for himself.
Order!
Mr. Traill, you refuse to pay this license.
- On a matter of prin...
- Kindly don't interrupt!
Quite apart from the question of the license, there is something else.
According to the law, you are guilty of harboring a stray without reporting the fact to the police.
For that, the minimum fine of five shillings will be imposed.
And if I pay the license against my principles, the fine will no' be imposed?
That is so.
In that case, Your Honor,
I shall appeal against your decision to the lord provost and all the other magistrates
- and then to the court of sessions!
- Mr. Traill, the high judiciary have more important business than reviewing small matters of this lind.
It's no' a small matter for me to be entered into the burgh court's records as a lawbrealer!
If I refuse to pay the license, but continue to feed the wee dog as I always have, you'll hold me in contempt of court.
- If you're asling for information...
- I'm no' asling for anything.
I'm maling plain my own line of conduct.
But you're asling me to let a wee dog starve for a legal technicality.
Order! Silence!
Mr. Traill, are you defying this court?
Certainly not, Your Honor.
You deny ownership of this wretched dog.
Yet you bring no witnesses to support your story?
No witnesses, Your Honor.
But by your leave, I'd lile to say this:
Davie, the next time you're near my dining rooms... come in and let the wee dog you're persecuting give you a lesson in manners and morals.
Bobby at least has never bit the hand that feeds him.
But you have, Davie.
And you've had many a free meal from me.
Silence!
Mr. Traill, on your own admission, you are guilty of harboring a stray without reporting it as such.
You will therefore present yourself here - and bring the dog with you - at half past eight of the clocl before this court goes into session.
Have I no' a chance to appeal,
Your Honor?
Half past eight of the clocl here tomorrow morning.
Step down if you please, Mr. Traill.
Ailie, lassie.
Did ye ever give a wee dog a good wash?
You mean Bobby, Mr. Traill? No.
But Tammy's sometimes washed him for
Mr. Brown and says it's no difficult matter.
Aye... Mr. Brown's in poor health, I'm told.
So there's no chance of Bobby getting washed again until the siclness is all gone.
But I want him washed, Ailie.
He has serious business ahead of him.
- He has?
- Aye. Very serious.
So you bring him here clean and brushed at 8:00 in the morning.
Are ye talin' him somewhere, Mr. Traill?
Is it a picnic?
Aye, I'm talin' him somewhere, lassie, but it's no' a picnic.
It's a serious matter of principle.
But you've done your worl. Off you go.
Now gang away home.
We're right on time, Mr. Traill.
We washed him clean and combed him with my granny's comb.
Aye. He lools a picture. Here.
Here's a penny for each of you.
Ailie, you can give Tammy some of the porridge coolin' on the fire.
But where are you talin' Bobby, Mr. Traill?
To see someone of importance, laddie.
But I willna tale you tied, Bobby.
Here. There's me boy.
Come on.
Come on now. There's a boy.
Hello, Ailie.
You're, uh, worlin' for Mr. Traill now, are ye?
Aye. For a whole weel now.
Did, uh, Mr. Traill tell you about the burgh court yesterday?
- About him and the wee dog?
- No. Why?
- He's just talen Bobby with him now.
- Aye. To see someone of importance.
Och, that's just his way of putting it.
He's taling Bobby to stand before the burgh court as he was ordered to.
Tale Bobby? Why?
Well, if a dog has no master to pay for his license, the police tale him up and put him out of the way.
- What?
- Aye.
And Mr. Traill willna pay the license because Bobby's no' his dog.
How much are they wantin' for the license, then?
- Seven shillings.
- Seven shillings!
- But that's a fortune.
- Aye.
But I canna stop here talling.
I'm over late for worl.
Seven shillings to allow one wee dog to live.
Not anybody - not even Mr. Traill - ever had seven shillings all at once.
I have the penny Mr. Traill just gave me.
How much have you, Tammy?
Seven shillings is 84 pennies,
168 ha'pennies... and 336 farthings.
But there's more foll around the old lirlyard than farthings in seven shillings.
Yes, Ailie, but they're over poor.
But, Tammy, we have to get it.
Mr. Traill has gone to give him up.
He was wearing all his good clothes and a long face to go to Bobby's burial.
Not if we can get the money first.
Tell everybody, Ailie - everybody you can find.
And I will too.
Every bairn in Greyfriars, Ailie. And run!
Have you any money to save the wee dog's life?
I'm looling for the man Traill, the case with the dog. Have you seen him?
You cannae go in there until the court is in session, at 9:00.
- But I'm a member of the press...
- That's my orders, sir, from the lord provost himself.
Oh? The lord provost isn't listed to be here today. I thinl I'd better wait.
And as many would say, this is no' much of a case for the lord provost to bother his head about, Your Worship.
I must be the judge of that, Mr. Traill.
Sergeant MacLean has the prisoner in custody, I see.
Now, Mr. Traill, the points at issue are very simple.
Do you give food and shelter to this dog?
And do you own him?
- Let's tale the first point first.
- Aye, I lodge him.
Uh, I've always fed the wee dog, ever since...
Well, I've always fed him and I'm no' denyin' it.
Why did you, if he is not your own?
Well, at first, to ease my conscience, because I blame myself in part for the death of the wee dog's master.
You said "at first." What then?
Och, uh... I've courted the wee terrier for a long, long time since then, because I've nobody of my own.
But he'll have none of me.
Except he's friendly and polite.
He just grieves for the old man that's dead.
The law says the dog must have an owner.
And I canna claim to be that,
Your Lordship, because it's no' true.
But I cannot believe the law would male a man abandon his principles and lie or... tale the life of a wee dog for a matter of a few shillings and a piece of paper.
The law deals with facts, not with emotions, Mr. Traill.
The dog is ownerless and unlicensed.
Is there a case about a wee dog in there?
- You cannae go in there.
- You see, Jeanie? I told you that.
Whisht, man. My husband and I are important witnesses in the case.
Is it in there?
Here! You cannae go in there,
We are the dog's owners, sir.
Begging your pardon, Your Lordship, but that's right. That's right.
James Brown, you're telling a lie!
He's the caretaler of the lirlyard, Your
Lordship, that's so sicl at home in bed.
Constable, let these two witnesses in - no one else. You stay outside.
- Your name?
- James Brown, Your Lordship.
- You claim ownership of the dog?
- Aye, we do.
And we've come to pay the license for him.
Aye, my wife has the money here in her purse.
We just heard about the dog being talen up and I thought...
Yes, yes, Mr. Brown. You're claiming ownership. In that case...
It's no' the case at all, Your Lordship!
James Brown is not the owner of the dog.
If I pay for him, I am.
You have no legal right to Bobby any more than I.
Mr. Brown.
Does the dog sleep under your roof?
Well...
No, Your Lordship. No' at night.
No, I canna say that.
He sleeps in the lirlyard.
With the minister's permission, of course?
Well... no, Your Lordship, I canna say that.
Och! This is but a wee dog that holds its gab, and it's very respectful.
Aye, and he's only been there such a short time, Your Lordship.
For some months, Mr. Brown.
The minister told me that himself.
The minister Inows?
He told Your Lordship?
He was told by the bible reader at the funeral.
Then by the minister at Cauldbrae where the dog once lived.
And might live now, if you had not fed him every day to leep him here.
The folls at Cauldbrae didna license him, Your Lordship, or there'd be no charge for the lacl of it.
I'm paying for Bobby's license myself,
John Traill.
Ye'll do no such thing, James Brown.
In all my life, I've never surrendered a principle before, Your Lordship.
But the charge is on me, and I'll... I'll pay it.
I feel I must point out to you both that the dog sleeps under neither of your roofs, so belongs no more to one than to the other.
I was summonsed to license him and be his owner.
- And I will.
- But I asled first!
Perhaps both of you are thinling more of winning an argument than winning the dog.
A dog needs a home. But it needs love, too. That more than anything.
Your Lordship, do ye thinl he doesnae get that?
Because he most certainly does.
No' only from me and my wife, but from every child in Greyfriars.
They feel he's one of them.
Your Lordship, dinna send him away from the lirlyard.
For many of the bairns in Greyfriars,
Bobby is the only love they Inow.
What are you bairns doin' in here?
Come on. Out of it.
Go on, the lot of ye. Out!
Mister, mister, we're loolin' for Greyfriars Bobby.
Aye. And Mr. Traill that brought him here.
Are you going out or no'?
Young savages in the burgh court!
Have ye talen leave of your senses?
Lool for yourselves! Lool!
- Y-y-your Lordship!
- Silence. Close the door.
Lool! He's not dead.
Will it be all right now, Mr. Traill?
I've got the money for a license in my bonnet, Mr. Traill.
Is it you I pay, mister?
It's seven shillings if you wish to count.
But where did you bairns get all this money from? And how?
Everybody around the lirlyard gave it, to pay the police not to male Bobby dead.
I gave a farthing, Mr. Traill.
Aye, near every bairn we asled.
I gave a penny.
Everybody gave something.
Whisht! Whisht!
Have ye no respect for where ye are?
In the great burgh court.
- Whisht!
- Mr. Traill, hand the dog up here.
Answer me this, any of you.
Do you Inow what it means to be given the freedom of the city?
Tammy would Inow, sir.
He's a scholar at Heriot's School... now.
It's when the queen comes, mister, and you give her the leys to the burgh gates that are not here anymore.
Right, laddie.
The gates and walls are down.
But we still give the leys to visitors who are grand or wise or just useful out of the ordinary.
Lile the Dule of Wellington and Miss Florence Nightingale.
Yes. The brave and faithful.
Now, here's a wee dog that's been faithful out of the ordinary.
For a dead man he loved, he's gone hungry and been cold.
He has never forgotten him or left his side by night.
And do the police no' have to tale him?
If he is made free of the city, he can wander where he liles.
- What would Bobby do with leys?
- Sh!
"Greyfriars Bobby, from the lord provost!
Licensed."
Ailie, 'tis the lord provost himself, and I called him "mister."
If dozens of children who Inow him will bring seven shillings in farthings and pennies for him, they buy the right for the dog to live in care of them all in the lirlyard of Greyfriars.
But he must have a collar, so that all the police will Inow him and never tale him up for a masterless dog.
He belongs to all of you.
And all of you are responsible for him now.
You're free, wee man.
Off you go.
- Bobby's free!
- Bobby's free!
Hey, wait! Wait for me!
Get away, Bobby. Get away.
Is the wee dog the regimental mascot there, Corporal?
Oh, that's Greyfriars Bobby, sir.
He belongs to the city.
- Have you not heard of him?
- Och, aye, of course.
So that's him.
- Hello, Bobby. How ye doin'?
- Hello, Bobby. How are ye?
I'm sorry the door wasn't open, but I had my hands full.
Here. Come on.
Down here. There.
Good night to ye, Bobby.
Bobby. Almost shut ye out.
I must never do that again.
Will ye no' come in?
What for?
Ohh, to have a wee dram with Jeanie and myself.
Come.
Good night to ye, Bobby.
Good night, Bobby.
Good night, Bobby.
Good night to ye, Bobby.
I'll see ye in the mornin'.
- Good night, Bobby.
- Good night. Sleep well.
Be out to play with ye in the mornin'.
Good night, Bobby.
Good night to ye, laddie.
Good night.
Good night, dog. Good night, Bobby.
My story begins in London.
Not so very long ago.
And yet so much has happened since then,
that it seems more like an eternity.
At that time, I lived with my pet
in a bachelor flat just off Regent's Park.
It was a beautiful spring day,
a tedious time of the year for bachelors.
Oh. That's my pet, Roger.
Roger Radcliffe, a musician of sorts.
No. No, I'm the one with the spots.
My name's Pongo.
And you know, as far as I could see,
the old notion that a bachelor's life was so glamorous
and carefree was all nonsense.
It was downright dull.
It was plain to see that my old pet needed someone.
But if it were left up to Roger, we'd be bachelors forever.
He was married to his work. Writing songs.
Songs about romance, of all things,
something he knew absolutely nothing about.
Oh, he's intelligent enough, as humans go.
And I think you could say that Roger is a rather handsome animal in his way.
I could see no reason why my pet didn't deserve an attractive mate.
At least, I was determined to do my best.
Of course, dogs are a pretty poor judge of human beauty.
But I had a rough idea of what to look for.
Hmm. Unusual breed.
Very unusual.
Oh, surely not.
Well, now, what have we here?
Hmm.
Well, a little too short-coupled.
Nope.
I say... Oh, well I do say!
Now, there's a fancy breed.
Hmm... Perhaps a little too fancy.
Yes. That's much too fancy.
Too old.
Too young.
It was a problem. A real problem.
Well, now that's a bit more like it!
The most beautiful creature on four legs.
Oh, now, if only the girl...
Well! She's very lovely, too.
It was almost too good to be true.
I'd never find another pair like that, not if I looked for 100 years.
Ah, they're heading for the park.
A perfect meeting place, if I could only arrange it.
Uh-oh. But Roger never stopped work till after 5:00.
That would be too late.
After 5:00 already.
Fancy that.
All right, Pongo. All right, boy.
Pongo, boy, take it easy!
What's all the hurry?
Pongo, boy, slow down.
I was afraid we'd missed them.
Perhaps they passed on by the park.
Then suddenly, I spotted them.
It was a perfect situation if I planned it right.
I couldn't depend on Roger.
I knew what he'd do.
He'd settle on the grass, puff his pipe and that would be it.
No, it was all up to me.
Well...
At first I had no particular plan,
just anything to attract attention.
You know, stir things up a bit.
Pongo, you silly old thing! Come on.
Come on, let's have it, boy.
Pongo!
Pongo!
For a while, it seemed to work.
At least they had seen one another.
Things were going along first-rate.
But for some strange reason they left!
Come on, you old renegade.
We're going home.
But I wasn't giving up.
I was determined that, somehow, they just had to meet.
- Oh!
- Oh!
I beg your pardon. I'm so sorry. Please excuse me.
- I must say, what on earth!
- Oh, dear!
Oh, really. Good heavens. Of all the...
- Oh!
- Ah!
Oh, my new spring suit and my new hat!
I'm terribly sorry.
Please let me help you.
I'm so sorry. Pongo, you...
I don't know what's come over him.
I'm terribly sorry. He's never acted this way before.
Never mind. Never mind.
Please, just go away.
You've done enough.
Please? Oh.
Oh, I say. Here, take mine.
Oh.
Wilt thou love her, comfort her, honour and keep her in sickness and in health, and forsaking all others, keep thee only unto her so long as ye both shall live?
I will.
For the first six months or so,
we lived in a small house near the park,
a modest little place,
but just right for two couples who were just starting out.
Perdita, darling, are you all right?
Oh, of course, dear.
After all, dogs were having puppies long before our time.
Oh, that's Nanny, a wonderful cook and housekeeper.
She's such a kind, understanding soul.
You know,
at times she seems almost canine.
Roger, dear, tea time.
Tea time!
Be down in a minute
Do you like my new song?
- Such clever lyrics.
- Melody first, my dear.
And then the lyrics, hmm?
Oh, Pongo, it's her.
It's that devil woman.
Oh, must be Cruella, your dearly devoted old school mate.
Cruella De Vil.
That's it!
Cruella De Vil
Cruella De Vil
If she doesn't scare you no evil thing will
Oh, Roger.
To see her is to take a sudden chill
Oh!
Cruella
She's like a spider waiting for the kill
Roger, she'll hear you.
Look out for Cruella De Vil
Let her in, Nanny.
- Anita, darling!
- How are you?
Miserable as usual.
Perfectly wretched!
Where are they? Where are they?
For heaven sakes, where are they?
- Who, Cruella?
- The puppies! The puppies.
No time for games. Where are the little brutes?
It'll be at least three weeks.
No rushing these things.
Anita, you're such a wit.
Here, dog, here.
Here, dog.
Cruella, isn't that a new fur coat?
My only true love, darling.
I live for furs. I worship furs!
After all, is there a woman in this wretched world who doesn't?
Oh, I'd like a nice fur, but there are many other things...
Sweet, simple Anita.
I know, I know!
This horrid little house is your dream castle.
And poor Roger is your bold and fearless Sir Galahad!
Oh, Cruella.
Then of course you have your little spotted friends.
Oh, yes.
Yes, I must say, such perfectly beautiful coats.
- Won't you have some tea?
- I've got to run.
Let me know when the puppies arrive.
- You will, won't you, dear?
- Yes, Cruella.
Don't forget, it's a promise.
See you in three weeks. Cheerio.
Cheerio, darling.
Oh!
At first you think
Cruella is a devil
But after time has worn away the shock
You come to realise
You've seen her kind of eyes
Watching you from underneath a rock
You're no help.
This vampire bat
This inhuman beast
She ought to be locked up and never released
The world was such a wholesome place until
Cruella
Cruella De Vil
Roger, you are an idiot!
- Perdy?
- That witch. That devil woman.
She wants our puppies.
That's all she's after.
Don't worry, Perdy.
They're on to her.
Nothing's going to happen to our puppies.
What does she want with them?
She can't possibly love them.
Oh, Pongo.
I was so happy at first, but now I...
Oh, I...
I wish we weren't having any.
Poor Perdita. Of course, she had no choice.
The puppies arrived right on schedule,
one wild and stormy night in October.
Steady, boy.
The puppies are here!
Oh, the puppies are here!
How many?
- Eight.
- Eight?
By George, Pongo! Eight puppies.
Ten.
- Eleven.
- Eleven.
Eleven? Eleven puppies, Pongo, boy.
Wait a minute now, wait a minute, 13!
No, no, no. Fourteen.
- Oh, 15!
- Fifteen?
And the mother's doing fine, love.
You ducky thing, you.
Fifteen puppies?
Why, Pongo, that's marvellous!
It's fabulous!
Why, you old rascal!
Fourteen.
Just 14.
We lost one.
Oh, poor little thing.
Oh, Pongo, boy.
It's just one of those things.
And yet...
And yet I wonder.
Look, Pongo.
Anita!
Nanny. Fifteen!
We still have 15!
Oh, Roger, he's all right!
Thank heaven.
See? He's just as good as new.
Can you imagine, Roger, 15 puppies!
Fifteen. Fifteen puppies!
How marvellous.
How marvellous, how perfectly... Ugh!
The devil take it. They're mongrels, no spots!
No spots at all. What a horrid little white rat.
They're not mongrels!
They'll get their spots.
Just wait and see.
That's right. They'll have their spots in a few weeks.
Oh, well, in that case I'll take them all. The whole litter.
Just name your price, dear.
I'm afraid we can't give them up.
- Poor Perdita, she'd be heartbroken.
- Anita, don't be ridiculous.
You can't afford to keep them.
You can scarcely afford to feed yourselves.
I'm sure we'll get along.
Yes, I know. I know!
Roger's... Roger's songs!
Enough of this nonsense. I'll pay you twice what they're worth.
Come now, I'm being more than generous.
Blast this pen.
Blast this wretched, wretched pen! Ah!
When can the puppies leave their mother?
Two weeks? Three weeks?
Never.
- What?
- We're not selling the puppies.
Not a single one.
Do you understand?
Anita, is he serious?
I really don't know Roger.
- Cruella, he seems...
- Surely he must be joking!
No, no, no. I mean it.
You're, you're not getting one. Not one.
And that's final.
Why, you horrid man!
You... You...
All right, keep the little beasts for all I care.
Do as you like with them.
Drown them!
But I warn you, Anita, We're through.
I'm through with all of you!
I'll get even. Just wait.
You'll be sorry, you fools!
You idiots!
Oh, Roger! You were magnificent, darling.
He was a bloomin' hero, ma'am!
Indeed he was. A bloomin' hero!
Perdy? Perdy, darling?
We're keeping the puppies, every single one of them.
My ol' pet Roger, he told that devil woman off.
He told her off, Perdy. She's gone.
- Darling, she's gone for good.
- Oh, Pongo.
- Come on, Thunderbolt.
- Come on, Thunderbolt.
Go get him, Thunder.
After him, boy.
He'll get that dirty ol' horse thief.
Old Thunderbolt's the greatest dog in the whole world.
He's even better than Dad.
No dog's better than Dad.
What's he going to do, Dad?
Shh. Shh. Let's just wait and see.
Look at him run, the old coward.
That old dirty Dawson!
The yellow-livered old skunk!
I'd like to tear his gizzard out.
Why, Patch, where did you ever hear such talk?
Certainly not from your mother.
- Watch out, Thunder.
- Don't worry, Penny.
He'll get that yellow-livered...
Well, he'll get him, all right.
Lucky, get down. We can't see. Get down.
Mother, make him get down.
Come on, Lucky. Down, dear.
Missed him. Missed him by a mile.
I'm hungry, mother. I'm hungry.
Now, Rolly, you've just had your dinner.
But I am, just the same.
I'm so hungry I could eat a whole elephant.
Shh!
There he is, behind that rock.
Oh, dear. He shot poor Thunder.
He missed him. Ol' Thunder's pretending, I think.
See? What did I tell you?
That's one of his tricks.
Lucky, get down.
I'm hungry, Mother. I really am.
Don't miss next week's episode. Who will triumph?
Ol' Thunder always wins!
And speaking of champions, friends,
Kanine Krunchies is the champion of all dog biscuits.
Kanine Krunchies can't be beat
They make each meal a special treat
Happy dogs are those who eat nutritious Kanine Krunchies
Perdy, we better get these little nippers off to bed if we're going for a W-A-L-K.
- We want to go, too, Mother.
- Can we, Mother?
We never get to go.
Come along, children. Bedtime.
But we're not a... bit sleepy.
We want to go for a walk in the park.
- Dad, can we?
- Better do as your mother says.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13...
I'm not sleepy. I'm hungry.
Fourteen.
Hmm?
So do what all the smart dogs do
And you'll feel great the whole day through
You can be a champion, too if you eat Kanine Krunchies
Remember, friends, just send five...
Lucky, you little rascal, let's go.
There they go, Horace, me lad, out for their evening constitutional.
Oh. A lovely pair of turtledoves.
Around the Johnny Horner and off to the park.
Yeah, I don't like it, Jasper.
One more pinch and they'll throw the keys away.
Oh, come off it, Horace. We're getting plenty of boodle.
Yes, but I've been thinkin'.
You've been thinkin'?
I warned you about thinkin'.
I've got the knob for this job, so let's get on with it.
Ah, nobody home but the little ol' cook.
You just leave her to ol' Jasper.
He can handle her real diplomatic-like.
Yeah, but I still don't like it.
Here, here. Patch, you settle down.
Oh, dear.
Go to sleep now.
Close your little eyes.
That's a good little one.
Who do you suppose?
Good evening, ma'am.
We're here to inspect the wiring and the switches.
- We're from the gas company.
- Electric, electric.
Electric company.
But we didn't call for any inspection.
Yes, I know. See, there's a new act just been passed in Parliament.
Under the heading of the "Defence of the
Realm Act." Article four, section 29.
It's a law. And it's for your own safety, ma'am.
I don't care what Parliament
Realm or whatever it is says.
You're not coming in here, not with the Mister and Missus gone.
Oh, now. Come off it, Ducky.
We got no time to palaver.
We got a job to do. Excuse me!
What's the matter with you two?
You got cloth ears? I said you're not coming in here!
- Oh!
- Oh-ho-ho!
She's a regular little tartar, ain't she, Horace?
Don't you dare go up there, you big, long-legged lummox!
Now I mean it.
If you don't get out of this house,
I'll call the police, I will.
Now be off with you, you big weasel!
Now you've been gone and done it.
You've cut me to the quick, lady.
Why, I wouldn't stay here if you asked me.
Not even for a cup of tea.
Oy! Horace, me lad, I've got a sneaky suspicion we're not welcome here.
Pack up. We're leaving.
Sharp's the word and quick's the action.
Let me out! Help!
I'll call the police. Help!
Goodnight, Ducky. Ta-ta!
Those good-for-nothing hoodlums!
Electric company. Hmph!
Nothing but common sneak thieves.
I'll bet they made off with the good silver.
Why, I'll bet they took every last...
The puppies!
The puppies! They're gone!
Patch? Lucky? Rolly?
Oh! They took the puppies!
Oh, whatever will I do?
Those scoundrels!
They stole the puppies.
Police? Help! The puppies.
Police! Somebody help me!
Help! Help! Help!
"Dognapping!" Tsk-tsk. Can you imagine such a thing?
"15 puppies stolen." They are darling little things.
Anita and her...
And her bashful Beethoven!
Pipe and all!
Oh, Roger, you are a fool!
Hello?
Jasper! Jasper, you idiot!
How dare you call here?
We don't want no more of this, we want our boodle!
We'll settle for half!
Not one shilling 'till the job's done.
- Jasper! Jasper!
- Do you understand?
It's in the blinkin' papers, pictures and all!
Hang the papers! It'll be forgotten tomorrow.
- I don't like it.
- Shut up, you idiot!
What?
Not you, miss. I mean Horace!
Why, you imbecile!
Maybe Scotland Yard.
Maybe they found something.
Hello, Inspector?
- Is Anita there?
- Who?
- Anita!
- It's for you.
- Hello?
- Anita, darling.
- Oh. Cruella.
- Oh, Anita.
What a dreadful thing.
I just saw the papers.
I couldn't believe it.
Yes, Cruella. It was quite a shock.
- Is she calling to confess?
- Roger, please!
She's a sly one.
We're doing everything possible.
- Have you called the police?
- Yes, Scotland Yard.
- But I'm afraid...
- Where are they?
You idiot!
- Anita!
- Sorry, Cruella.
Yes. If there's any news, we'll let you know.
Thank you, Cruella.
Roger, I admit she's eccentric, but she's not a thief.
She's still number one suspect in my book!
She's been investigated by Scotland Yard.
- What more do you want?
- I don't know, darling.
I don't know.
Oh, Rog. What'll we do?
What'll we do?
Perdy, I'm afraid it's all up to us.
Oh, Pongo. Isn't there any hope?
Well, yes. There's the twilight bark.
The twilight bark? That's only a gossip chain.
Darling, it's the very fastest way to send news.
If our puppies are anywhere in the city, the London dogs will know.
We'll send the word tonight when our pets take us for a walk in the park.
There's no one out tonight.
I'm afraid it's too cold.
We've got to keep trying, Perdy.
Perdy, we're in luck!
It's the Great Dane at Hampstead.
Pongo. Quiet, boy!
Do you want to stir up the whole neighbourhood? Come on. Pongo.
- Perdy, come on!
- Let's go.
Pongo, you old idiot!
Come on, now. We're going home!
What is it, Danny?
Who's on the telegraph?
It's Pongo, Regent's Park!
It's an all-dog alert.
What's it all about? What's the word?
Tell me, Danny! Tell me, tell me!
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Well, now... Hmm, that is something.
What, Danny? What's something?
Fifteen Dalmatian puppies, stolen!
Have they called the police?
Scotland Yard?
The humans tried everything.
Now it's up to us dogs and the twilight bark.
I'll sound the alert!
Prissy, come in here!
Coco!
Be quiet now!
Ah, shut up!
Quiet!
Will you be quiet!
Towser, what's going on?
What is it? What's all the gossip?
'Tain't no gossip, Lucy. It be all the way from London.
- You don't say!
- Fifteen puppies stolen.
There's no puppies around here, not since Nellie's last litter.
And they're all grown up.
Well, then, we'd best send the word along.
It be up to me to reach the Colonel!
He be the only one in barking range.
You'll never reach him at this hour!
Well, I can try!
I'll bark all night if I have to.
Hmm...
Hmm... Sounds like old Towser.
It's an alert. Sergeant!
Sergeant Tibs! I say, Sergeant!
Oh, yes, Captain!
Barking signal. It's an alert.
Report to the Colonel at once.
Yes, sir. Right-o, sir.
Right away, sir!
Colonel?
I say, Colonel!
Colonel, sir? Colonel?
- Colonel?
- What? Who goes there?
Sergeant Tibs reporting, sir.
- Tibs? Tibs? Oh, yes, Sergeant Tibs!
- Colonel, sir...
Look here, Tibs. What's the idea of barging in at this hour?
- But Colonel...
- Hold on, Sergeant.
You hear that?
- Sounds like an alert.
- Yes, Colonel.
We'd better look into it.
Come along, on the double.
Right-o, sir.
It's old Towser down at Withermarsh, sir.
By Jove, yes! So it is. Hmm.
Well, I'll see what he wants. it be the Colonel.
The old boy himself!
He wants the message.
You'd better make it loud and clear or he'll never get it.
One long howl, two short.
- One yip and a woof.
- Two yips, sir.
- What's the word, Colonel?
- It's from London.
Then it must be important.
Yes, yes, I'll get the rest of it.
Sounds like a number.
Three fives are 13...
That's 15, sir.
Fifteen, of course 15.
Yes, dot, spot, spotted puddings, poodles...
No, no, puddles.
Puddles, sir?
Fifteen spotted puddles stolen.
Oh, balderdash.
Better double check it, Colonel.
Oh, yes, yes, I suppose I better.
Two woofs, one yip and a woof.
It sounds like puppies, sir.
Of course, puppies.
Colonel, Colonel, sir,
I just remembered.
Two nights past I heard puppy barking over at Hell Hall.
You mean the old De Vil place?
Nonsense, Tibs! No one's lived there for years.
Hold on! There's smoke coming from the chimney!
By Jove, that's strange, strange indeed.
I suppose we'd better investigate.
I'll send word for ol'
Towser to stand by.
Please stand by.
- What's he mean by that?
- I don't know.
Oh, maybe the ol' boy's found something!
Oh, I do hope so.
They say the ol' place is haunted or bewitched or some such fiddle-faddle.
Fiddle-faddle and rot, sir.
Just the same, use extreme caution.
No telling what sort of hocus-pocus you might run into.
Blast it all, Tibs.
On the double, man.
- On the double.
- Yes, sir. Right away, sir.
Psst!
- Rover. Spotty.
- Hmm. What?
Are you one of the
15 stolen puppies?
No, we're not stolen.
We're bought and paid for.
There's 99 of us all together.
Ninety-nine!
How 'bout that bunch of little ones?
They have names and collars.
They're not from the pet shops.
- Fifteen of 'em.
- We never counted them.
They're over there by the TV.
- I'd better count 'em.
- Watch out for the Baduns.
Baduns?
Those two blokes,
Horace and Jasper.
They're mean ones, they are.
Hey, look, Horace!
Watch me pot His Lordship smack on the conk.
How's that for calling 'em, eh?
One, two,
- three, four, five, six...
- Hey, Jasper.
Come on, now, give us a swig, just a short one.
Now, Horace, this hogwash ain't fit for a fancy bloke like yourself.
Besides, you'd get crumbs in it, you cabbage head!
All right.
Guzzle the whole works. I hope it gives you collywobbles, that's what.
Hey, Jasper. Did you...
Let me see. Six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11...
Hey, get down, you runt!
And stay down!
Go on, get out of here or I'll black your other peeper.
Where was I? Nine...
Nine, three more.
Twelve and... One, two, three. That's 15!
They're the ones!
Blimey!
What the...
Horace, look what we got! A tabby cat!
How'd you like a tabby cat stew?
Or a cat casserole?
À la mode.
- What is it, Pongo? What is it?
- Shh. It's the Great Dane.
He has news for us. He'll meet us at Primrose Hill.
- How'll we get out?
- Uh, the back bedroom window.
It's always open a wee bit. Come on.
Pongos, you've made it. Good.
- What's the word? What's the news?
- Have they found our puppies?
They've been located somewhere north of here,
- in Suffolk.
- Oh, thank heaven.
- Can you leave tonight?
- We can leave right away.
I'll go along as far as Camden
Road and give you instructions.
When you reach Withermarsh, contact old Towser.
He'll direct you to the Colonel and the Colonel will take you to your puppies at the De Vil place.
- De Vil!
- The De Vil place!
Oh, Pongo, it was her!
Oh, someone you know?
Sorry, sir. There's no time to explain.
Oh, I hope we're not too late.
Good luck, Pongos.
If you lose your way, contact the barking chain.
They'll be standing by!
Any news, Colonel?
Not a blasted thing.
They're lost or captured, or something or other.
- Who knows what.
- Colonel, here comes a car.
Come now, Tibs.
Don't be ridiculous.
- They wouldn't be driving.
- Yes, I know, sir.
But it's heading for Hell Hall.
It's stopping at the gate!
It is? Blast it all!
Better see what's up.
- On the double, man. On the double!
- Yes, sir.
Take over, Captain.
Right-o, sir.
I'm sorry, Mr Simpkins.
The answer's no, no, no.
Six down, four to go.
I've got no time to argue.
It's got to be done tonight.
It must be a yes or no question, Inspector.
Do you understand? Tonight!
But they ain't big enough.
You couldn't get half a dozen coats out of the whole caboodle.
Coats! Dog-skin coats?
Then we'll settle for half a dozen! We can't wait.
The police are everywhere.
I want the job done tonight!
How're we gonna do it?
Any way you like. Poison them, drown them.
Bash them in the head.
You got any chloroform?
- Not a drop.
- And no ether, ei-ther.
Eye-ther!
I don't care how you kill the little beasts, but do it, and do it now!
Aw, please, miss. Have pity.
Can't we see the rest of the show first?
We want to see What's My Crime?
Listen, you idiots!
I'll be back in the morning.
The job better be done, or I'll call the police!
Do you understand?
I think she means it.
Ah... We'll get on with it, as soon as the show's over.
Will you please sign in, sir?
You'd better get out of here if you want to save your skins.
- But how?
- Shh.
There's a hole in the wall there by the door.
Come on, shake a leg.
Psst! Kids, follow me.
Hey, Jasper, look!
It's old Meathead.
Yeah, what do you know, old Meathead Fauncewater.
Come on, don't crowd.
One at a time. One at a time!
For our last contestant,
meet Mr Percival Fauncewater.
If the panel fails to guess your unusual crime in ten questions,
you will receive two weeks vacation at a seaside resort,
all expenses paid.
That is, after you've paid your debt to society.
Who will take the first question? Inspector?
Mr Fauncewater, could your crime be classified as larceny?
- A theft, burglary?
- Straighten out!
Form a queue, along the wall.
Come on. Snap it up, faster.
Mr Fauncewater is a burglar by trade, but in this case,
his crime was not burglary.
I'm sorry, the answer's no. One down, nine to go. Miss Birdwell?
If your crime wasn't robbery, did you,
oh, dear, what I mean is,
do something of a violent nature, that is...
Come, Miss Birdwell, we're running short of time.
So sorry. Did you do someone in?
No, Miss Birdwell, I'm sorry.
The answer is no.
Two down, eight to go.
- Mr Simpkins?
- Psst!
Hey, kid, let's go.
Could it be a violation of a city ordinance?
Uh, no. The answer is...
Hey, get out of the way, you little runt!
Three down, seven to go. Inspector?
Very confusing, I must say.
Surely, this crime could...
I'm terribly sorry.
We've run out of time.
Ain't that always the way!
Would it be possible for Mr Fauncewater
to come back next week?
Then we could finish our little game.
Good night, audience. See you next week at this same time on What's My Crime?
Ah. Oh, well.
Come on, Horace.
Let's get on with it.
I'll pop 'em on the head, you do the skinnin'.
No, you don't, Jasper!
I'll pop 'em off and you do the skinnin'.
Horace, look!
They're gone. They flew the coop, right out through this hole.
Here, grab a torch.
We'll run 'em down before you can say "Bob's your uncle."
There they go, Horace, up the stairs.
Here, puppies.
Here, puppies! Come on now.
Don't go hiding from ol' Uncle Jasper.
Oh, I ain't gonna hurt ya.
I thought we was gonna pop 'em off.
Shh! Shut up.
Take a squint in there. I'll check these other two rooms.
Here, puppies.
Puppies, come on out. Come out wherever you are.
Horace! Ooh!
It's that mangy tabby cat!
He's the ringleader!
Head 'em off, Horace! Head 'em...
You bungling blockhead!
Back here! Back here!
Shh! Here they come.
Double-crossin' little twerps, pulling a snitch on us!
After we took care of 'em.
There's gratitude for you.
It ain't fair, Jasper.
Horace, there they go!
Sergeant? I say, Sergeant.
No time to explain. Busy, sir.
Shut that door, Horace!
We'll close in on 'em. Enough of this Ring Around the Rosy.
Oh, Pongo, I'm afraid we're lost.
It can't be far.
By Jove! It can't be the Pongos.
It's the Colonel. This way.
Colonel? Are you the Colonel?
Oh, Pingo! Pongo?
Our puppies, are they all right?
No time to explain.
There's trouble.
A big hullabaloo. Come along!
Follow me!
Now we've got 'em, Horace.
They've run out of room.
What have we got here?
A couple of spotted hyenas?
Come on, Horace. Give 'em what for.
I'm right behind ya, lad.
Oh!
You clumsy clod!
Hey! I'll knock the spots off you. Let go!
Let go!
Well, by George!
You mangy mongrel!
I'll knock your blinkin' block off.
Blast 'em, Tibs. Give 'em what for.
No, Colonel. Retreat, retreat!
Yes. Yes, of course. Retreat!
Retreat, on the double!
Help, Jasper! Get me out of here!
Horace, they're fighting dirty!
Oh!
Jasper!
Horace!
Come on, Perdy. Let's go.
I'll skin every one of them spotted hyenas if it's the last thing I do.
Dad! Mother!
- I missed you, Mommy.
- Here we are, Mommy.
Oh, my darlings, my darlings!
How'd you find us, Dad?
Lucky, Patch, Pepper!
Hi, Freckles.
Oh, Daddy.
And Rolly, you rascal!
Did you bring me anything to eat?
Everybody here? All 15?
Twice that many, Dad.
Now there's 99 of us!
What? Ninety-nine?
Where did they all come from?
What would she want with so many?
She's gonna make coats out of us.
- She couldn't!
- That's right, dog-skin coats.
Oh, dog-skin coats! Come now, Tibs!
But it's true, sir.
Horace and Jasper were gonna pop us off and skin us!
She's a devil, a witch!
What'll we do?
We have to get back to London somehow.
What about the others?
What'll they do?
Perdy, we'll take them home with us, all of them.
Our pets would never turn them out.
Colonel, sir, lights on the road.
It's a truck headin' this way.
It's the Baduns, Horace and Jasper.
They're following our tracks.
We've got 'em outnumbered, Tibs.
When I give the signal, we'll attack.
Colonel, sir, I'm afraid that would be disastrous.
Oh, you think so?
He's right. We'd better run for it.
Out the back way, across the pasture.
Thank you, Sergeant,
Colonel, Captain.
- Bless you all.
- How can we ever repay you?
Nothing at all. All in the line of duty.
That's right, sir, routine.
Better be off. Here they come.
Come on, kids, hurry.
- Good luck, Pongos.
- And never fear.
We'll hold them off
'til the bitter end.
Now, what's this?
Out of my way, you barkin' haystack.
Or I'll knock your blinkin' block off!
They ain't in here, Jasper.
They're hiding in the hay.
Give me a match.
We'll burn 'em out.
Ready, Captain. Aim.
Fire one.
Fire two.
Hey, there they go, the little sneaks.
Come on, back to the truck.
We'll head 'em off in half a mile.
They gotta be around here somewhere.
- I've been thinkin'.
- Now, Horace.
What if they went down the froze-up creek, so's not to leave their tracks?
Horace, you idiot!
Dogs ain't that smart.
All clear, Perdy.
- All clear.
- We gave 'em the slip! Didn't we, Dad?
They didn't even see us, Patch!
Shh, children. Children, shh.
My feet are slippery.
I wish we could walk on the snow.
No, son, we can't leave tracks.
Well, any sign of them?
Not so much as one bloomin' footprint.
And we've been up and down every road in the county.
We're froze stiff. We're givin' up.
Oh, no, you don't!
We'll find the little mongrels if it takes till next Christmas.
Now get going! Watch your driving, you imbeciles! Do you wanna get nabbed by the police?
Ninety-three,
Oh, Lucky!
Come on, Lucky, boy.
We can't give up now.
I'm tired and I'm hungry and my tail's froze, and my nose is froze and my ears are froze.
And my toes are froze.
Pongo!
Pongo! Pongo!
We'd just about lost hope.
We have shelter for you, at the dairy barn across the road.
Oh, thank goodness.
Perdy! Perdy!
This way, Perdy.
- The dairy barn across the road.
- Come on, kids.
It's not far. Come on, this way. Follow the collie.
Just look, Queenie.
- Have you ever seen so many puppies?
- Aren't they adorable!
- Perfectly darling.
- The poor little dears.
They're completely worn out and half frozen!
They all here, Pongo?
Yes, dear. All 99 accounted for.
The famous Pongos. We were so worried about you.
Been trying to reach you.
Afraid you'd been captured.
How did you make it all this way?
- And in such dreadful weather.
- With all those little ones.
I'm hungry, Mother. I'm hungry.
- I'm hungry, too.
- Mother, we're hungry.
- We're all hungry.
- I'm sorry, children.
Do they like warm milk? It's fresh.
- Where is it?
- Where is the milk?
Come and get it, kids.
It's on the house.
This way, children.
Around this way.
Don't crowd. You'll have to take turns.
Rolly, wait your turn, dear.
Don't worry, kids.
There's plenty for all.
Ooh! The little darlings.
Pongo, a few scraps I saved
- for you and the missus.
- Oh, thank you.
It's not much, but it might hold you as far as Dinsford.
Huh? Dinsford?
There's a Labrador there.
His pet is a grocer.
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
Quite all right.
Get some rest and don't worry.
I'll be standing watch.
I don't know what we'd have done if...
- We're very honoured to be of service.
- We're only sorry we can't do more.
Anyone who would think of hurting these dear little puppies...
- Shh! Duchess!
- They're so dear.
I wish they could stay with us for always.
Princess, shh! Quiet, everyone.
Let them sleep, the poor things.
They're so exhausted and they still have such a long way to go.
Hurry, kids. Hurry!
Well now, what have we here?
Well, so they thought they could outwit Cruella.
Jasper! Horace!
Here's their tracks heading straight for the village.
Blimey! Oh, it's them, all right.
Work your way south on the side roads. I'll take the main road.
See you in Dinsford!
Pongo, I've got a ride home for you.
A ride home? Perdy, did you hear that?
For all of us?
You mean we don't have to walk any more?
If we can manage it.
Come on. We'd better hurry.
We've got a ride home!
Come on, children.
See the van down the street?
It's going to London as soon as the engine's repaired.
And there's room for all of you.
Pongo, there's Cruella.
Yes, and Jasper and Horace.
Pongo, how will we get to the van?
I don't know, Perdy.
But somehow we've got to.
Mother, Dad,
- Patch pushed me in the fireplace.
- Lucky pushed me first.
- Did not. Did not.
- Did, too. Did, too.
Did not!
- Please, children, don't quarrel.
- Say...
Perdy, I've got an idea.
Pongo, what on earth...
Look, I'm a Labrador!
We'll all roll in soot.
We'll be Labradors.
Say, that is an idea!
Come on, kids! Roll in the soot.
You mean, you want us to get dirty?
Did you hear that, Freckles?
Dad wants us to get dirty.
- Mother, should we?
- Do as your father says.
- This'll be fun.
- I always wanted to get good and dirty.
That's the stuff. The blacker the better.
- I'm ready.
- Me, too.
How's this, Dad?
Wait. That's enough. Not too many at a time.
Uh-oh. Rolly, hold on.
You're only half done.
Now, stay right with me.
We're gonna fool the ol' mad lady.
Pongo.
I'm so afraid.
Look, Jasper.
Do you suppose they disguised themselves?
Say now, Horace. That's just what they did.
Dogs is always painting theirselves black!
You idiot!
Well, so far so good.
Come on, Perdy. Better get on your make-up.
I'll go ahead with the next bunch.
Jasper! Horace!
- Well?
- Aw, now be reasonable, miss.
We're froze clean to our bones.
We've been out all night and all day, with nothin' to eat.
They're somewhere in this village, and we're going to find them.
Now get swing!
Do you think they've seen us?
No, but we're running out of time.
Try 'er again, mate.
Hurry, Perdy. The van's about to leave.
Better hurry.
I'll get the rest.
That ought to do her. She'll get you back to London.
Better get aboard, miss.
Hey, Jasper.
Come on, Horace.
Hurry, kids!
Come on, kids. Run on ahead.
- She's watching us, Dad.
- Keep going.
It can't be!
It's impossible!
Run for it!
Jasper! Horace!
Jasper!
There they go! In the van.
After them! After them!
Pongo! There she is, Cruella.
Hey, lady, what in thunder are you tryin' to do?
Crazy woman driver!
Pongo, look!
Jasper!
Ain't nothin' to it.
I'll give him a nudge and shove him in the dirt.
Perdy, watch out!
- Jasper!
- Horace!
You idiots!
You fools!
You imbeciles!
Ah, shut up!
You've seen her kind of eyes
Watching you from underneath a rock
Cruella De Vil
Cruella De
Roger, after all, that's your first big hit.
It's made more money than we ever dreamed of.
Yes, I know.
I still can't believe that Pongo and Perdy would run away.
Here's a bit of Christmas cheer for you, if there's anything to be cheerful about.
Oh, the dear little things.
Sometimes at night I can hear them barking.
But it always turns out I'm dreaming.
Roger, what on earth...
They're Labradors!
No, no. They're covered with soot.
Look, here's Lucky!
Pongo, boy, is that you?
Oh, Pongo, Pongo!
Ho-ho, it's Pongo!
And Perdy, my darling.
And Patch, and Rolly, and Penny, and Freckles.
They're all here, the little dears.
- It's a miracle!
- What a wonderful Christmas present!
And look, there's a whole lot more!
Look, Anita, puppies everywhere.
There must be 100!
One, two, three and four, is seven.
Two, four, six, and three is nine, plus two is 11.
- Thirty-six over here.
- Thirty-six and 11, that's 47!
- Eighteen, Roger.
- That's 65!
Ten, 11, 12, 13!
Wait a minute, six more.
Let's see, that's 84.
And 15 plus two, 101!
A hundred and one? Where did they come from?
Oh, Pongo, you old rascal!
- What'll we do with them?
- We'll keep 'em.
- In this little house?
- We'll buy a big place in the country.
We'll have a plantation, a Dalmatian plantation.
Roger, that's truly an inspiration.
It'll be a sensation!
We'll have a Dalmatian plantation.
A Dalmatian plantation, I say.
We'll have a dalmatian plantation
Where our population can roam
- I'm hungry, mother.
- In this new location
Our whole aggregation
Will love our plantation home
Dalmatian plantation home
NARRATOR: Every Who down in Who-ville liked Christmas a lot.
But the Grinch...
...who lived just north of Who-ville, did not.
The Grinch hated Christmas, the whole Christmas season.
Now, please, don't ask why.
No one quite knows the reason.
It could be perhaps that his shoes were too tight.
It could be his head wasn't screwed on just right.
But I think that the most likely reason of all...
...may have been that his heart was two sizes too small.
But whatever the reason, his heart or his shoes...
...he stood there on Christmas Eve hating the Whos.
Staring down from his cave with a sour Grinchy frown...
...at the warm lighted windows below in their town.
For he knew every Who down in Who-ville beneath...
...was busy now hanging a holly Who-wreath.
And they're hanging their stockings.
He snarled with a sneer.
Tomorrow is Christmas.
It's practically here.
Then he growled, with his Grinch fingers nervously drumming:
I must find some way to keep Christmas from coming.
Or tomorrow, I know, all those Who girls and boys...
...will wake bright and early, they'll rush for their toys.
And then... Oh, the noise. Oh, the noise.
Noise, noise, noise.
There's one thing I hate. All the noise.
Noise, noise, noise.
And they'll shriek squeaks and squeals, racing round on their wheels.
[BICYCLE BELLS RINGING]
They'll dance with Jing-Tinglers tied onto their heels.
They'll blow their Floo-Floobers.
They'll bang their Tah-Tinkers.
[PLAYING]
They'll blow their Who-Hoobers.
They'll bang their Gah-Ginkers.
They'll beat their Trum-Tookers.
They'll slam their Sloo-Slonkers.
They'll beat their Blum-Blookers.
They'll wham their Who-Wonkers.
And they'll play noisy games like Zoo Zitta Ka Zay...
...a roller-skate type of lacrosse and croquet.
And then they'll make earsplitting noises de luxe...
...on their great big
Electro Who-Cardio Shluxe.
[PLAYING]
Then the Whos, young and old, will sit down to a feast.
And they'll feast, and they'll feast.
And they'll feast, feast, feast.
They'll feast on Who-pudding and rare Who-roast-beast.
Oh, roast beast is a feast
I can't stand in the least.
And then they'll do something
I hate most of all.
Every Who down in Who-ville, the tall and the small...
...will stand close together with Christmas bells ringing.
They'll stand hand in hand, and those Whos will start singing.
[SINGING "WELCOME CHRISTMAS"]
And they'll sing, and they'll sing.
And they'll sing. Sing, sing, sing.
NARRATOR: And the more the Grinch thought of this Who-Christmas sing...
...the more the Grinch thought:
I must stop this whole thing.
Why, for 53 years,
I've put up with it now.
I must stop Christmas from coming.
But how?
Then he got an idea. An awful idea.
The Grinch got a wonderful, awful idea.
GRINCH:
I know just what to do.
The Grinch laughed in his throat.
GRINCH: I'll make a quick Santy Claus hat and a coat.
Then he chuckled and clucked:
GRINCH:
What a great Grinchy trick.
With this coat and this hat,
I'll look just like Saint Nick.
All I need is a reindeer.
The Grinch looked around.
But since reindeer are scarce, there was none to be found.
Did that stop the Grinch? Ha.
The Grinch simply said:
GRINCH: If I can't find a reindeer,
I'll make one instead.
So he took his dog, Max, and he took some black thread...
...and he tied a big horn on the top of his head.
Then he loaded some bags and some old empty sacks...
...on a ramshackle sleigh, and he whistled for Max.
[WHISTLES]
- Then the Grinch said:
- Giddap.
[YELPS]
And the sleigh started down...
...toward the homes where the Whos lay a-snooze in their town.
All their windows were dark.
No one knew he was there.
All the Whos were all dreaming sweet dreams without care...
...when he came to the first little house on the square.
This is stop number one.
The old Grinchy Claus hissed as he climbed to the roof, empty bags in his fist.
Then he slid down the chimney.
A rather tight pinch.
But if Santa could do it, then so could the Grinch.
He got stuck only once, for a minute or two.
Then he stuck his head out of the fireplace flue...
...where the little Who stockings hung all in a row.
These stockings...
He Grinched.
- Are the first things to go.
Then he slithered and slunk with a smile most unpleasant...
...around the whole room and he took every present.
Pop guns, pampoonas, pantookas and drums...
...checkerboards, bizzel-binks, popcorn and plums.
Then he stuffed them in bags.
Then the Grinch, very nimbly...
...stuffed all the bags, one by one, up the chimney.
[WHISTLES]
[GRUNTING]
Then he slunk to the icebox.
He took the Whos' feast.
He took the Who-pudding.
He took the roast beast.
He cleaned out the icebox as quick as a flash.
Why, that Grinch even took the last can of Who-hash.
Then he stuffed all the food up the chimney with glee.
GRINCH: Now...
- Grinned the Grinch.
GRINCH:
- I will stuff up the tree.
As the Grinch took the tree, as he started to shove...
[CINDY-LOU WHIMPERS]
...he heard a small sound like the coo of a dove.
He turned around fast, and he saw a small Who...
...little Cindy-Lou Who, who was no more than 2.
She stared at the Grinch and said:
Santy Claus, why?
Why are you taking our Christmas tree?
Why?
But, you know, that old Grinch was so smart and so slick...
...he thought up a lie, and he thought it up quick.
Why, my sweet little tot...
The fake Santy Claus lied.
- There's a light on this tree that won't light on one side.
So I'm taking it home to my workshop, my dear.
I'll fix it up there, then I'll bring it back here.
And his fib fooled the child.
Then he patted her head.
And he got her a drink, and he sent her to bed.
And when Cindy-Lou Who was in bed with her cup...
...he crupt to the chimney and stuffed the tree up.
Then he went up the chimney himself, the old liar.
And the last thing he took was the log for their fire.
On their walls, he left nothing but hooks and some wire.
And the one speck of food that he left in the house...
...was a crumb that was even too small for a mouse.
Then he did the same thing to the other Whos' houses...
...leaving crumbs much too small for the other Whos' mouses.
It was a quarter of dawn, all the Whos still abed...
...all the Whos still a-snooze...
...when he packed up his sled.
Packed it up with their presents, their ribbons, their wrappings...
...their snoof and their fuzzels, their tringlers and trappings.
[SCREAMS]
Ten thousand feet up, up the side of Mount Crumpit...
...he rode with his load to the tiptop to dump it.
Pooh-pooh to the Whos.
NARRATOR:
He was Grinch-ily humming.
They're finding out now that no Christmas is coming.
They're just waking up.
I know just what they'll do.
Their mouths will hang open a minute or two.
Then the Whos down in Who-ville will all cry boohoo.
- That's a noise...
- Grinned the Grinch.
- That I simply must hear.
He paused.
And the Grinch put a hand to his ear.
And he did hear a sound rising over the snow.
It started in low...
...then it started to grow.
[WHOS HUMMING]
[WHOS SINGING
"WELCOME CHRISTMAS"]
But this sound wasn't sad.
Why, this sound sounded glad.
Every Who down in Who-ville, the tall and the small...
...was singing without any presents at all.
He hadn't stopped Christmas from coming, it came.
Somehow or other, it came just the same.
And the Grinch, with his Grinch feet ice-cold in the snow...
...stood puzzling and puzzling.
How could it be so?
It came without ribbons.
It came without tags.
It came without packages, boxes or bags.
He puzzled and puzzed till his puzzler was sore.
Then the Grinch thought of something he hadn't before.
"Maybe Christmas," he thought,
"doesn't come from a store.
Maybe Christmas, perhaps, means a little bit more."
And what happened then?
Well, in Who-ville they say...
...that the Grinch's small heart grew three sizes that day.
And then the true meaning of Christmas came through.
And the Grinch found the strength of 10 Grinches plus two.
And now that his heart didn't feel quite so tight...
...he whizzed with his load through the bright morning light.
With a smile in his soul, he descended Mount Crumpit...
...cheerily blowing Who-Who on his trumpet.
[TRUMPET PLAYING]
He rode into Who-ville, he brought back their toys.
He brought back their floof to the Who girls and boys.
He brought back their snoof and their tringlers and fuzzels.
He brought back their pantookas, their dafflers and wuzzels.
He brought everything back, all the food for the feast.
And he himself, The Grinch...
...carved the roast beast.
Welcome Christmas, bring your cheer.
Cheer to all Whos far and near.
Christmas day is in our grasp, so long as we have hands to clasp.
Christmas day will always be just as long as we have we.
Welcome Christmas while we stand, heart to heart and hand in hand.
[ENGLISH SDH]
If I Iive to be a hundred,
I'II never be abIe to forget that big snowstorm... a coupIe of years ago.
The weather cIosed in, and, weII, you might not beIieve it, but the worId aImost missed Christmas.
Oh, excuse me. CaII me Sam.
What's the matter?
Haven't you ever seen a taIking snowman before?
Nice around here, isn't it?
I caII it Christmas Town, better known as the North PoIe.
The Christmas Tree Forest.
Yep, here's where we grow them.
Nice pIace to Iive, you know.
Christmas seaIs.
The number-one citizens up here... are the CIauses:
Santa and the missis.
They Iive right over there, first castIe on the Ieft.
Matter of fact, the onIy castIe on the Ieft.
Papa, you haven't touched a morseI!
I'II have to take this suit in! Eat!
I'm busy, Mama!
It's aImost Christmas!
Whoever heard of a skinny Santa?
Eat! Eat!
Don't any of you worry your heads about Santa.
Mrs. CIaus wiII have him pIenty fattened up by Christmas Eve.
It's aIways the same story.
Ahh! I Iove this Christmasy time of year, especiaIIy when everything is running happy and smooth...
Iike it is this season.
Nothing Iike that year of the big snowstorms.
I don't know what we wouId have done... without RudoIph to puII us through.
Anyway...hmm, RudoIph?
CouId it be some of you are not acquainted... with the story of RudoIph?
WeII, puII up an ice bIock and Iend an ear.
Now, you know how Santa uses these fIying reindeer... to puII his sIeigh.
You know Dasher and Dancer... and Prancer and Vixen...
Comet and Cupid... and Donner and BIitzen...
But do you recaII
The most famous reindeer of aII?
WeII, now, Iet me teII you about RudoIph.
It aII started a coupIe of years before the big snow.
It was springtime, and Santa's
Iead reindeer Donner... had just become a proud papa.
Nah, we'II caII him RudoIph.
RudoIph is a IoveIy name.
RudoIph.
Hey, hey!
He knows his name aIready!
Papa. Mama.
He's got a shiny nose!
Shiny? I'd even say it gIows!
WeII, we'II simpIy have to overIook it.
How can you overIook that?
His beak bIinks
Iike a bIinking beacon!
WeII, Donner, where's the new member of the famiIy?
After aII, if he's going to be on my team someday, he'd better get to know me.
WeII, hi there. Aren't you the sturdy IittIe feIIow?
Santa?
And smart, too!
Great bouncing iceberg!
I'm sure it'II stop when he grows up, Santa.
WeII, Iet's hope so if he wants to make the sIeigh team someday.
You see, IittIe feIIow, every year I shine up my jingIe beIIs... for eight Iucky reindeer.
JingIe, jingIe, jingIe
You wiII hear my sIeigh beIIs ring
I am oId Kris KringIe
I'm the king of jing-a-Iing
JingIe, jingIe, reindeer
Through the frosty air they'II go
They are not just pIain deer
They're the fastest deer
I know, ho ho
You must beIieve that on Christmas Eve
I won't pass you by
I'II dash away in my magic sIeigh
FIying through the sky
JingIe, jingIe, jingIe
You wiII hear my sIeigh beIIs ring
I am oId Kris KringIe
I'm the king of jing-a-Iing
I am oId Kris KringIe
I'm the king of jing-a-Iing
Ho ho!
Bye-bye.
Oh, Santa's right.
He'II never make the sIeigh team.
Wait a minute! I've got it!
We'II hide RudoIph's nose.
-Hide it?
-Yeah.
Come here, boy.
You'II be a normaI IittIe buck just Iike everybody eIse, right?
A chip off the oId antIers.
Now, now. You'II get used to it.
Put it there, son.
Aw, gee.
For the first year, the Donners did a pretty fair job... of hiding RudoIph's, uh, nonconformity.
Donner taught RudoIph aII the ins and outs... of being a reindeer: how to get food, how to fight off enemies, things Iike that.
But most important...
Most important of aII, he taught his son to beware... of the AbominabIe Snow Monster of the North.
He's mean, he's nasty, and he hates everything to do with Christmas.
Now, aside from the AbominabIe, business goes on as usuaI.
And soon it is right before Christmas, and everybody is getting ready for that big, big sIeigh ride... on the night of the 24th--
Christmas Eve!
See, aII the toys Santa brings are made by these eIves.
Seems eIves have that certain knack for toy-making.
AII except for this one misfit.
Hermey!
Aren't you finished painting that yet?
There's a piIeup a miIe wide behind you.
What's eating you, boy?
Not happy in my work, I guess.
What?!
I just don't Iike to make toys.
Oh, weII, if that's aII.
What?! You don't Iike to make toys?
No.
Hermey doesn't Iike to make toys.
Oh, shame on you!
Mind teIIing me what you do want to do?
WeII, sir, someday I'd Iike to be a dentist.
A dentist?!
WeII, we need one up here.
I've been studying. It's fascinating. You've no idea.
MoIars and bicuspids and incisors.
Now, Iisten, you. You're an eIf, and eIves make toys.
Now get to work!
10 minutes break!
Not for you!
Finish the job, or you're fired!
Why am I such a misfit?
I am not just a nitwit
You can't fire me
I quit
Seems I don't fit in
Ah, weII.
Such is the Iife of an eIf.
MeanwhiIe, RudoIph is having his growing pains, too.
OId Donner is determined to keep RudoIph's nose a secret.
AII right, son. Try it on.
I don't wanna.
Daddy, I don't Iike it.
You'II Iike it and wear it.
Oh, but, Daddy!
It's not very comfortabIe!
There are more important things than comfort: seIf-respect.
Santa can't object to you now.
Why am I such a misfit?
I am just not a nitwit
Just because my nose gIows
Why don't I fit in?
And so time passes.
Christmas comes and goes on scheduIe, and soon it is ApriI, when aII the new fawns come out with their foIks... to meet the other new fawns and to be inspected by Santa.
Now, don't worry about your nose, son.
Just get out there and do your stuff.
Remember, you're my IittIe buck.
Hi. My name's FirebaII.
What's yours?
-RudoIph.
-You can be my buddy.
-Where are we going?
-The reindeer games.
Makes antIers grow.
Besides, it's a great way to show off in front of the does.
Ah, youth.
MeanwhiIe, the eIves are bustIing with activity.
Christmas is over, but they stiII keep busy with Iessons... in eIf improvement.
AII out for eIf practice!
Let's get this over with.
I have to Iook over the new deer.
OK, Santa. Let's try out the new eIf song I wrote.
And remember, it's for Santa.
And a-1 and a-2 and a-3...
Ho ho ho, ho ho ho
We are Santa's eIves
We are Santa's eIves
FiIIing Santa's sheIves
With a toy for each girI and boy
Oh, we are Santa's eIves
We work hard aII day
But our work is pIay
DoIIs we try out, see if they cry out
We are Santa's eIves
We've a speciaI job each year
We don't Iike to brag
Christmas Eve we aIways fiII Santa's bag
Santa knows who's good
Do the things you shouId
And we bet you he won't forget you
We are Santa's eIves
We've a speciaI job each year
We don't Iike to brag
Christmas Eve we aIways fiII Santa's bag
Santa knows who's good
Do the things you shouId
And we bet you he won't forget you
We are Santa's eIves
Ho ho ho, ho ho ho
We are Santa's eIves, ho ho
Hmm. WeII, it needs work.
I have to go.
What does Papa know?
It's beautifuI.
You keep it just the way it was.
Papa? Papa!
That sounded terribIe!
The tenor section was weak.
Wasn't our fauIt, boss.
Hermey didn't show up.
What?
Now, this won't hurt a bit.
Why weren't you at eIf practice?
Just fixing these doIIs' teeth.
Just fixing--
Now, Iisten! We have doIIs that cry, taIk, waIk, bIink, and run a temperature.
We don't need any chewing doIIs.
I just thought I found a way to fit in.
You'II never fit in!
You come to practice and Iearn how to wiggIe your ears... and chuckIe warmIy and go ''hee hee'' and ''ho ho'' and important stuff Iike that.
A dentist! Good grief!
No. I just can't.
It's Iike he said:
I'II never fit in.
I guess I'm on my own now.
Hey, Iook! Does!
What do you know?
One of them Iikes you.
Yeah, FirebaII?
You reaIIy think so?
Here comes the coach.
AII right.
AII right, yearIings.
AII right, now!
That's better.
My name is Comet.
Even though I'm your instructor,
I want to be your paI.
Right? Right.
My job is to make bucks out of you. Let's go.
Now then, our first game is caIIed Takeoff.
We aII want to puII
Santa's sIeigh someday, so we must Iearn to fIy.
Now, who's first to try?
Me! Me!
One at a time!
You're Dasher's IittIe boy, aren't you?
You go first. The whoIe trick is getting up enough speed... and jumping into the wind.
You got it? Go ahead.
Very good...for a first try.
Next!
He won't get to us for a whiIe.
Go get acquainted with that doe.
Nice day.
Yup.
For takeoff practice, I mean.
Yup.
I bet you'II be the best.
WeII, I don't know.
Something wrong with your nose?
I mean, you taIk kind of funny.
What's so funny about the way I taIk?
Don't get angry. I don't mind.
You don't?
My name's CIarice. Hi.
My name's RudoIph. Hi.
Hi.
Hey, CIarice... after practice, wouId you-- wouId you--
RudoIph, you get back here!
It's your turn.
Gee, I got to go back.
WouId you waIk home with me?
Uh-huh...RudoIph.
I think you're cute.
I'm cute!
I'm cute!
Magnificent!
I'm cute! I'm cute!
She said I'm cute!
Not bad. Not bad at aII.
Hey, you're OK.
She said I'm cute!
For crying out Ioud!
FirebaII, what's the matter?
Get away from me!
What's this nonsense here, bucks?
After aII--Aah!
Hey, Iook at the beak.
Hey, Fire Snout!
Rainbow puss!
Red schnoz!
Stop caIIing me names!
RudoIph the red-nosed reindeer.
Donner, you shouId be ashamed of yourseIf.
What a pity.
He had a nice takeoff, too.
AII right now, yearIings.
Back to practice.
Oh, no. Not you.
You better go home.
From now on, we won't Iet RudoIph join in any reindeer games.
Right! Right!
WeII, what do you want?
You promised to waIk me home.
Aren't you going to
Iaugh at my nose?
It's a handsome nose, much better than that faIse one you were wearing.
It's terribIe.
It's different from everybody eIse's.
But that's what makes it so grand.
Any doe wouId consider herseIf Iucky to be with you.
Yeah?
But I wasn't very Iucky today, was I?
I wish...
I--I wish...
There's aIways tomorrow for dreams to come true
BeIieve in your dreams, come what may
There's aIways tomorrow with so much to do
And so IittIe time in a day
We aII pretend the rainbow has an end
And you'II be there, my friend, someday
There's aIways tomorrow for dreams to come true
Tomorrow is not far away
We aII pretend the rainbow has an end
And you'II be there, my friend, someday
There's aIways tomorrow for dreams to come true
Tomorrow is not far away
CIarice!
Get back to your cave!
-But I--
-This instant, young Iady!
Yes, sir.
There's one thing
I want to make pIain: no doe of mine wiII be seen with a red-nosed reindeer!
Oh, is this your snowbank?
No. Who are you?
WeII, actuaIIy, I am a dentist.
A dentist?
WeII, I want to be someday.
Right now, I'm just an eIf.
But I don't need anybody.
I'm...
I'm independent.
Yeah? Me, too.
I'm...whatever you said.
Independent.
Hey, what do you say we both be independent together, huh?
You wouIdn't mind my red nose?
Not if you don't mind me being a dentist.
It's a deaI.
We're a coupIe of misfits
We're a coupIe of misfits
What's the matter with misfits?
That's where we fit in
We're not daffy and diIIy
Don't go round wiIIy-niIIy
Seems to us kind of siIIy
That we don't fit in
We may be different from the rest
Who decides the test of what is reaIIy best?
We're a coupIe of misfits
We're a coupIe of misfits
What's the matter with misfits?
That's where we fit in
Why am I such a misfit?
I am not just a nitwit
I'm a dear of a reindeer
Why don't I fit in?
Why am I such a misfit?
I am not just a nitwit
They can't fire me
I quit
Seems I don't fit in
We may be different from the rest
Who decides the test of what is reaIIy best?
We're a coupIe of misfits
We're a coupIe of misfits
What's the matter with misfits?
That's where we fit in
These two had no idea about what they were
Ietting themseIves in for.
The worId Iooked a Iot more compIicated and dangerous... than it seemed when they were snug and warm at home.
The AbominabIe!
He must see your nose.
Quick, douse the Iight.
Like I said, the outside worId is up to its ears in danger.
WeII, somehow RudoIph and Hermey managed to get through the first night.
Mush!
Mush. Don't you understand
North PoIe taIk?
What's this?
Hey, you get frostbit that way.
Who are you?
Who am I?
The name's Yukon CorneIius, the greatest prospector in the North!
This is my Iand, and it's rich with goId.
GoId!
GoId and siIver.
SiIver and goId.
Wahoo!
Nothing.
SiIver and goId.
What do you think of our friend CorneIius?
Seems aII he thinks about is siIver and goId.
SiIver and goId
SiIver and goId
Everyone wishes for siIver and goId
How do you measure its worth?
Just by the pIeasure
It gives here on earth
SiIver and goId
SiIver and goId
Means so much more when I see
SiIver and goId decorations
On every Christmas tree
What's a Christmas tree... without pretty siIver and goId decorations?
Can't reaIIy caII it a Christmas tree, right?
Think of aII the joy that wouId be Iost on Christmas morning... if the young foIks didn't see that sparkIing, happy tree.
SiIver and goId
SiIver and goId
Means so much more when I see
SiIver and goId decorations
On every Christmas tree
I'm off to get my suppIies: cornmeaI, gunpowder, hamhocks, and guitar strings.
I'II give you a Iift.
Hop aboard, mateys.
Now, mush!
Like this. Watch.
Gadzooks!
The BumbIe Snow Monster of the North strikes again.
It's my nose!
It keeps giving us away.
I hate noisy bumbIe snow monsters.
We'II outwit the fiend with our superior inteIIigence.
-How?
-Douse your nose... and run Iike crazy!
Come on! Wahoo!
We're trapped.
There's no way out!
It's my nose again.
It's ruined us.
The bumbIe has one weakness, and I know it.
Do-it-yourseIf icebergs.
Observe: the bumbIe's one weakness.
The bumbIe sinks.
Yukon CorneIius scores again!
Whoopee!
Nothing.
Mister, where are we going?
You'II stay with me.
We'II aII be rich with the biggest siIver strike... this side of Hudson Bay.
SiIver!
I thought you wanted goId.
I changed my mind.
Our friends were reaIIy on their way, but not one of them knew where they were going.
You can bet oId Donner feIt bad about the way he had treated RudoIph.
He knew the onIy thing to do... was to go out and Iook for his IittIe buck.
Mrs. Donner wanted to go aIong, naturaIIy, but Donner said, ''No, this is man's work.''
No sooner did the man of the house Ieave... when Mrs. Donner and CIarice decided to set out on their own.
Now, they were reaIIy taking their chances because, you see, that IittIe ice boat... had run into a pack of mighty wicked fog.
HeIIo!
The fog is thick as peanut butter.
-You mean pea soup.
-You eat what you Iike.
Land ho!
No kidding.
WeII, where are we?
Hey! Looky up there!
Oh!
HaIt! Who goes there?
Us, of course.
WeII, then that's OK.
OK? Who, may I ask, are you?
We're RudoIph, Hermey, and
Yukon CorneIius. Who are you?
I'm the officiaI sentry of the IsIand of Misfit Toys.
A jack-in-the-box for a sentry?
Yes. My name is--
Don't teII me. Jack.
No. CharIie.
That's why I'm a misfit toy.
My name is aII wrong.
No chiId wants to pIay with a charIie-in-the-box, so I had to come here.
Where's here?
We're on the isIand of misfit toys
Here we don't want to stay
We want to traveI with Santa CIaus
In his magic sIeigh
A pack fuII of toys
Means a sack fuII of joys
For miIIions of girIs
And for miIIions of boys
When Christmas day is here
The most wonderfuI day of the year
A jack-in-the-box
Waits for chiIdren to shout
Wake up! Don't you know it's time to come out?
When Christmas day is here
The most wonderfuI day of the year
Toys gaIore
Scattered on the fIoor
There's no room for more
And it's aII because of Santa CIaus
A scooter for Jimmy
A doIIy for Sue
The kind that wiII even say
''How do you do?''
When Christmas day is here
The most wonderfuI day of the year
How wouId you Iike to be a spotted eIephant?
Or a choo-choo with square wheeIs on your caboose?
Or a water pistoI that shoots jeIIy?
We're aII misfits!
WouId you Iike to be a bird that doesn't fIy?
I swim!
Or a cowboy who rides an ostrich?
Or a boat that can't stay afIoat.
We're aII misfits!
If we're on the IsIand of Unwanted Toys
We'II miss aII the fun
With the girIs and the boys
When Christmas day is here
The most wonderfuI, wonderfuI
WonderfuI, wonderfuI
WonderfuI day of the year
Hey, we're aII misfits, too.
Maybe we couId stay for a whiIe.
You'd have to get permission from King Moonraiser.
Who's he?
He ruIes here.
Every night, he searches the entire earth.
When he finds a misfit toy, one that no girI or boy Ioves, he brings it to Iive here tiII someone wants it.
He's hoIding court in his castIe right now.
Come cIoser.
What do you desire?
We're a coupIe of misfits from Christmas Town, and now we'd Iike to Iive here.
No. That wouId not be possibIe.
This isIand is for toys aIone.
How do you Iike that? Even among misfits, you're misfits.
UnIike pIaythings, a Iiving creature cannot hide himseIf on an isIand.
But, perhaps, being misfits yourseIves, you might heIp the toys here.
HeIp them?
Yes. When someday you return to Christmas Town, wouId you teII Santa about our homeIess toys?
I'm sure he couId find chiIdren who wouId be happy with them.
A toy is never truIy happy untiI it is Ioved by a chiId.
When and if we ever get back, we'II teII Santa, sir.
Good. You are free to spend the night.
Footman!
Show our friends to their chambers.
No. It's aII settIed.
We Ieave tomorrow together.
But the AbominabIe wiII see my nose and get us aII.
I've got to go aIone.
Nonsense. It's aII for aII...
I mean, one...
Ah, Iet's get some shuteye.
-But--
-It's aII settIed.
WeII, poor RudoIph reaIizes... that he can't endanger his friends' Iives anymore.
And so, that night, he decides to strike out on his own.
Good-bye, CorneIius.
I hope you find Iots of tinseI.
Good-bye, Hermey.
Whatever a dentist is,
I hope, someday, that you're the greatest.
WeII, time passed sIowIy.
RudoIph existed as best he couId.
The snow monster kept him on the run... but once in a whiIe, he wouId stop and make a friend or two.
But it wouIdn't Iast Iong, and RudoIph wouId be on his own.
But during aII that time, a strange and wonderfuI thing was happening.
RudoIph was growing up, and growing up made RudoIph reaIize you can't run away... from your troubIes.
And pretty soon he knew where he had to go: home.
You! I thought you were gone for good.
Hey, Iook who's back: oId Neon Nose!
Mom? Pa?
I'm home!
They're gone, RudoIph.
They've been gone for months
Iooking for you.
CIarice?
She's gone, too.
I'm very worried.
Christmas Eve is onIy two days off, and without your father,
I'II never be abIe to get my sIeigh off the ground.
Gone?
I'II find him, sir.
I'II find them aII.
WeII, he was just about to Ieave when suddenIy...
It hit!
The storm of storms, and onIy two days before Christmas Eve.
RudoIph knew that he had to find his foIks right away, and he knew where he had to Iook: the cave of the AbominabIe Snow Monster.
Put her down!
TeII me when it's over.
Oh, where was I?
Their Iast chance.
Not quite. You see, ever since RudoIph Ieft them,
Hermey and Yukon CorneIius had tried to find their friend.
They arrived in Christmas Town just as the storm hit.
It was a good thing that I sent them right out after RudoIph.
Hey, Iook!
Whoa!
Unmush, wiII you?
What do we do? We can't Iet that monster get ahoId of them.
I got an idea. Listen.
-Yes.
-And then...
Not bad.
It might work.
Why doesn't he get it over with?
Pa? Ma?
CIarice!
Are you sure we can get him out?
Never knew the bumbIe snow monster yet... who'd turn down a pork dinner for deer meat.
Do your stuff!
Oink oink.
Put some heart in it!
That bumbIe's hungry!
Wahoo!
TerribIe weather we've been having.
Snow and ice.
AII right, dentist, you take it from here.
It's Yukon CorneIius!
Ta-da! In person.
We're saved!
Let's get outta here.
I'II Iight the way.
Why, bIast your hairy bumbIe hide.
Don't Iet this big bIowhard scare you anymore.
Just waIk right past him.
I teII you, you're Iooking at a mighty humbIe bumbIe.
He's nothing without his choppers.
Let me at him.
Wahoo!
Yukon!
He's gone!
Oh, he's gone!
WeII, they are aII very sad at the Ioss of their friend, but they reaIize that the best thing to do... is get the women back to Christmas Town.
So they make it back and when everybody hears their story, they start to reaIize... maybe they were a IittIe hard on the misfits.
Maybe misfits have a pIace, too.
Even Santa reaIizes that maybe he was wrong.
RudoIph, I promise, as soon as this storm Iets up,
I'II find homes for aII those misfit toys.
AII right. You can open up a dentist office.
Next week, after Christmas.
Come here. Open your mouth.
Oh, dear.
I'II set up an appointment for you: week from Tuesday,
4:30 sharp.
I'm sorry, too, RudoIph, for the way I acted.
Open up!
It isn't a fit night out for man nor beast!
Here's the man... and here's the beast!
Now, caIm down.
I reformed this bumbIe.
He wants a job.
Looky what he can do.
And he doesn't even need a stepIadder.
But...but...you went over the side of the cIiff.
Didn't I ever teII you about bumbIes?
BumbIes bounce!
WeII, as good as everyone feeIs, this is no time for ceIebrating... because the next day is Christmas Eve-- the biggest day of the year.
Eat, Papa, eat.
How can I eat? That siIIy eIf song is driving me crazy.
You're going to disappoint the chiIdren.
They expect a fat Santa.
Latest weather report, sir.
WeII, this is it.
The storm won't subside by tonight.
We'II have to canceI Christmas.
Papa, are you sure?
Everything's grounded!
Oh, the poor kids.
They've been so good this year, too.
But I couIdn't chance it.
I'II have to teII everybody that it's aII off this year.
Quiet! Quiet!
PIease, everybody quiet!
I've got some bad news, foIks.
Christmas is going to be canceIed.
There's nothing I can do.
This weather--
RudoIph, RudoIph, pIease!
CouId you tone it down a bit?
I mean, that nose of yours.
That nose!
That beautifuI, wonderfuI nose!
-Huh?
-RudoIph, Christmas is not off, and you're going to Iead my team.
I am?
Yes, sir. You and that wonderfuI nose of yours.
My nose, sir?
From what I see now, that'II cut through the murkiest storm they can dish up.
What I'm trying to say is...
RudoIph, with your nose so bright, won't you guide my sIeigh tonight?
It wiII be an honor, sir.
I knew that nose wouId be usefuI someday.
Have a hoIIy, joIIy Christmas
It's the best time of the year
I don't know if there'II be snow
But have a cup of cheer
Have a hoIIy, joIIy Christmas
And when you waIk down the street
Say heIIo to friends you know
And everyone you meet
Ho, ho, the mistIetoe
Hung where you can see
Somebody waits for you
Kiss her once for me
Have a hoIIy, joIIy Christmas
And in case you didn't hear
Oh, by goIIy
Have a hoIIy, joIIy
Christmas this year
HoIIy, joIIy
HoIIy, joIIy
Oooohhhhhh
Have a hoIIy, joIIy Christmas
And in case you didn't hear
Oh, by goIIy, have a hoIIy, joIIy Christmas
This year
Eat now. ''Ho ho ho'' Iater.
Let me check. Turn.
Oh, Mama!
Now, shake when you Iaugh.
Now, that's my Santa.
Oh, thanks, Mama. My coat!
Ready, RudoIph?
Ready, Santa!
WeII, Iet's be on our way.
OK, RudoIph. FuII power!
First stop, the IsIand of Misfit Toys.
Up, up, up, and away!
He'II be a hero after this.
Yes, a hero.
That's my buck!
Now, you see how it's done?
Wahoo!
Peppermint! What I've been searching for aII my Iife!
I've struck it rich!
I've got me a peppermint mine!
Wahoo!
WeII, it's Christmas Eve, but...
Looks Iike we're forgotten again.
But RudoIph promised we'd go this time.
Guess the storm was too much for them.
Might just as weII go to bed and start dreaming about next year.
I haven't any dreams Ieft to dream.
We'II never get off this isIand.
Wait a minute.
What's that?
Is it...is it...
It sure is! It's Santa!
And Iook!
RudoIph is Ieading the way!
You can see his nose from here.
WeII, Iet's be on our way.
Ready, RudoIph?
Ready, Santa!
OK, RudoIph. FuII power!
Up, up, up, and away!
WeII, foIks, as for the rest of the story...
He went down in history
RudoIph the red-nosed reindeer
Had a very shiny nose
And if you ever saw it
You wouId even say it gIows
AII of the other reindeer
Used to Iaugh and caII him names
They never Iet poor RudoIph
Join in any reindeer games
Then one foggy Christmas Eve
Santa came to say
''RudoIph with your nose so bright''
''Won't you guide my sIeigh tonight?''
Then how the reindeer Ioved him
As they shouted out with gIee
RudoIph the red-nosed reindeer
You'II go down in history
RudoIph the red-nosed reindeer
You'II go down in history
Merry Christmas!
Merry Christmas!
Pati!
You monster.
Nuru, don't leave the drinks where Pati can get at them.
I'm very sorry, Memsahib. That bad, Pati!
It's not really her fault.
You're not supposed to put temptation in the path of an alcoholic.
She's not a.... She's a rock hyrax.
Yes, and a disgrace to her species.
Anyway, we'll all have to be more careful.
-I'm sure it can't be good for her.
-Yes, but she likes it.
I Know. Now, where did I leave my paints?
Here, Memsahib.
Thank you, Nuru. Will you take Pati?
Thank you.
Now, no more drinking.
I am Joy Adamson...
...and for many years my home has been in the northern province of Kenya...
...where my husband, George, was senior game warden.
One of his duties was to deal with dangerous animals...
...who were a menace to either human life or to crops.
And we were on safari in the Boran region...
...where a man-eating lion had been reported.
Look out!
You've been very successful, haven't you?
-Joy, can you spare a minute?
-Yes, I suppose so. What is it?
I've a little something for you.
-Do they belong to those two up there?
-Yes.
We had to kill the mother.
I'm sorry. She attacked us and we didn't know why until it was too late.
Poor little dears. Come here, darlings.
Careful!
One gave Sam a first-class scratch.
Not very good-tempered, are they?
Neither are you when you're hungry. l don't suppose you've fed them.
No, I can't say I have.
You didn't pack any lion's milk for me before I left.
You didn't ask me.
Come on, darlings, never mind that brute.
We'll feed you.
We'll make you strong and healthy.
Come on.
Well, that wasn't a great success, was it?
But why don't they? lt's at least two days since they've eaten.
-They'll just die.
-Yes, I Know.
It must be the formula.
We haven't hit on it yet.
-We'll just have to try again.
-Right.
Back to the drawing board. Formula....
Thirteen.
George, I've just been thinking about the cod-liver oil.
Do you think we put too much in?
Twenty-four hours Iater, they were still refusing food of any kind.
They were actuaIIy dying of starvation before our eyes.
Formula seventeen.
To be perfectly honest, I'm beginning to wish I hadn't brought them back.
Come on, darling. Come on, sweetie.
What is it?
What are we going to do with you?
Why won't you eat?
Don't you see you'll die?
Come on, baby, there's a little sweetie baby.
My little sweeties.
There.
There.
A little nap and they'll be begging for more.
Yes, thanks to Elsa.
Who?
-The one who took the milk first.
-Oh, yes.
-But why "Elsa"?
-I don't know.
Well, I suppose I do really.
She reminds me of a little girl
I knew at school.
She was the smallest of us all and not good at games...
...but she was bright and brave and good, and I liked her very much.
-Her name was Elsa.
-Fair enough.
You're wonderful, too, darling.
After all, you're the one that did it.
Why, sure.
They said I couldn't do it, but I did it.
Formula seventeen. You're a genius.
You really ought to put it on the market.
No.
You see, it would never work without one special ingredient. This.
I'm not putting that on the market.
Even as babies, each had a different character.
The largest one, we called her the "Big One"...
...was vain of her size and strength.
The second largest, Lastika, was the clown of the three.
But my favorite, of course, was the smallest, EIsa.
A weakling in size but the bravest of them all...
...she loved to expIore and investigate and examine.
And there were no limits to her curiosity.
In the wild, she would have been the throw-out of the pride...
...for the smallest cub in a Iitter rarely survives.
But Elsa had no inferiority complex.
AII the cubs were, naturally, housetrained...
...and always took great care to reach the sandboxes outside.
But, also naturally, there were a few accidents in the early days...
...and when these happened, they were most embarrassed.
Unfortunately for Pati, very soon the cubs were too Iarge for her.
At three months oId, their teeth were big enough for them to eat meat.
And this soon meant that poor Iittle Elsa never got her fair share.
So I kept the best bits for her.
George said he was convinced
Elsa thought I was her mother.
Whatever she thought, she made me happy by following me everywhere...
...and keeping me company whiIe George was away.
When they grew older and needed more room to play...
...we put Nuru in charge of them, and they got along beautifully.
...we put Nuru in charge of them, and they got along beautifully.
Elsa!
What are you doing? Go away!
Go! Get away!
Getting them out of their cage for their morning exercise was never a probIem.
Come on, babies.
But putting them to bed was another story.
Come back!
-Come back, Big One.
-Come on, Big One.
Come back, Elsa!
In you go!
Come on. That's it.
Come on. Inside.
And you. There!
Eventually, we had to ban them entireIy from the house.
To make it up to them, we hung an old tire from a tree...
...and Elsa particularly fell in Iove with it.
They're beginning to look like lions now.
Yes, and to behave like them, too.
Don't I remember the father was a man-eater?
You don't believe that man-eating is an inherited trait, do you?
I don't think anyone really knows.
I hope you're ready for lunch, 'cause I am.
And hungry enough to eat a hyena.
John's just wondering if your cubs might start eating people one day.
You're joking, of course.
You know my lions are perfect little angels.
Yes, but they'll be very large angels soon.
Isn't it about time you thought of shipping them off to a zoo?
Is that an order, John?
You're touchy. Have you been feeding him that lion's milk he's famous for?
Of course it's not an order.
But it's a good idea, isn't it?
Yes, of course, you're right.
We've already arranged to send them to Rotterdam Zoo.
-We're not ecstatic about it.
-Why? lt's excellent.
He means we're going to miss them.
I know I will, terribly.
Particularly one of them.
Of course you will.
They're absolutely loveable at this age.
-Forgot to shut the gates.
-Heaven help the house. Hurry!
Perfect little angels!
John, be a dear and get hold of Elsa.
-Be careful, she's not very strong.
-Neither am I.
No, you don't understand. She's delicate.
So am I. Let George fetch her.
Would you mind keeping your eye on her?
We'll be back in a moment.
All right, my delicate one. Here I come.
-Joy, would you go back and fetch Elsa?
-Yes. I hope John doesn't scare her.
Steady.
Elsa, you naughty girl.
Don't you understand? He's the boss.
I'm sorry, John, you must have frightened her.
Come on, come on, darling.
You mustn't be afraid of John.
He likes lions.
AII too soon, we received word from the Rotterdam Zoo...
...that it was ready to receive the cubs.
We padded and wired the truck.
And each day we took them out for a long ride...
...in order to prepare them for the 180-miIe trip to the Nairobi airfieId.
I wouId leave Pati behind on these rides.
She was getting old now, and I kept her as quiet as possibIe.
-Look after Pati for me, Nuru.
-Yes, Memsahib.
-All right, darling?
-Yes, fine.
-Memsahib. Pati....
-What's happened?
She's very sick, I think from heat.
I think she die.
She's dead.
When the day that I had been dreading came...
...I went for a last waIk with Elsa.
Elsa?
There you are. Come on.
Come on, come on down.
This way. Come on.
Elsa, no!
Come away. Please!
Thank you, darling. That's a good girl.
If it's any consolation,
I feel as rotten about it as you do.
George, I think I ought to tell you that just now Elsa....
What about her?
Nothing.
Come on, love. Come on.
There you go, my sweetie.
-l suppose we do have to send them off.
-Yes.
All of them?
Yes, even Elsa.
Even if I told you that she just stopped me from walking into a great big cobra...
...and that she knew what she was doing?
I'm sorry, it wasn't fair to ask.
Let's get the show on the road, as they say.
-Would you mind if I did some shopping?
-No, good idea.
-Can you cope?
-Yes, I think so.
I'll meet you outside Ahmed's.
-How will you get there?
-In a taxi.
I know it's silly.
I know she's not a human being.
I know she's just a lion, but I wish
I could stop feeling so miserable.
You will.
No, I'm just a fool.
I'm going to miss her terribly.
You won't, you know.
Elsa, sweetie.
Darling, thank you. Thank you very much.
-Hello, George!
-Hello, John.
Good afternoon, Bwana Kendall.
-Where's Elsa?
-Elsa's not out here today.
Good.
-How's Bwana George?
-Much better now.
But that malaria was very bad.
Good thing he has strong medicine.
Yes. Well, you don't look too bad.
I boxed with Nuru before breakfast, and earned a draw.
Good.
-Marvelous stuff, these malaria pills.
-Yes, if you don't overdo it.
I'm feeling fine.
Well enough for Joy to go out...
...and you Know she wouldn't go if I wasn't fit.
Quite. What's she up to?
Having the Land Rover checked.
And in case you're wondering,
Elsa's with her.
I don't understand why everyone assumes that Elsa and I have a feud.
-Help yourself.
-Thank you.
Actually, George,
I wanted to talk to you about another lion.
You know, the one that's been snatching all those goats down in Kiunga.
I don't see why you have to travel all that way in your condition.
Why don't I send Ken, or one of the others?
No, I think I'd like some sea air.
If you can wait until I feel a bit stronger.
I don't mind. A change would do you good.
But don't overdo it, will you?
The best cure for malaria is rest.
I take your point, John.
II'll rest. I promise you.
-Here, isn't that....
-Yes.
Come on, Elsa.
Come on down. Ride's over.
Hurry up. Let's go and see how George is.
Hello, John, how nice of you to drop in.
-Here's some letters for you.
-Thanks.
-How are you?
-Fine.
Good.
-Boxed six rounds with John this morning.
-Earned a draw.
How does it feel to live with the boxing champion of the world?
Marvelous. We boxed two rounds this morning and I knocked him out.
Can you stay to dinner?
Or, better still, stay the night.
-I can do both.
-Good. I'll just go and warn the cook.
Poor darling, I've hurt her feelings.
Joy!
Hello, Elsa. Have a nice drive?
-Stop it, Elsa.
-Hello, Elsa.
Get down.
Why don't you go and say hello to John?
You know, I think I'm being snubbed.
-Now stop it, Elsa.
-I hope.
You're getting heavy, Elsa.
Stop it, you're squashing me.
Now, the question is:
What have I forgotten?
Tell you what I've forgotten.
I'm almost out of malaria pills.
Right. Goodbye, darling.
Look after yourself. And no boxing.
I wouldn't dream of such a thing.
-Goodbye, John. Lovely to see you.
-Thank you.
Now I must say goodbye to Elsa.
Where is she?
On her car.
Elsa, I told you you couldn't go to Nairobi with me.
Have you met my wife who talks to lions?
Please, come down. Elsa.
-I'm afraid you'll have to help me, Father.
-Good old Dad.
Elsa, don't be such a lunatic. Get down!
Get down!
Come on!
Come on! Good girl.
Will you have another cup of coffee before you go off?
No, thank you.
What will you do with Elsa while you're away in Kiunga?
We'll take her with us...
...unless you care to board her till we get back.
No, thank you.
You know, you're as much her prisoner as she is yours.
She's not a prisoner. She's a friend.
Yes, I know.
And there's probably no harm in taking her on a short trip, with reasonable care.
But your long leave is due soon.
Are you planning on taking her to England for a year?
No, it's a problem.
I've meant to talk to Joy about it, but...
...I suppose I've been waiting.
Don't wait too long.
Look after yourself.
Come on, lunatic.
You're blocking the road.
John wants to go home.
All clear, John.
Thank you.
Now, look, Joy will be back tomorrow.
You can't stay here all night.
Damn it!
Now you've got me talking to you.
Look, she'll be back tomorrow.
I promise you.
Elsa, go away.
Don't you sneak up on me like that.
It's very unpleasant.
Elsa, get down, you idiot. l don't know.
Stop playing about.
Kindly give me the towel.
Thank you.
Now let's have my dressing gown back.
Come on. Give it to me.
Right away.
Go on, push off!
Hello, Elsa.
Did you look after George for me?
-Hello, darling.
-Hello, George.
-Good trip?
-Not bad. A bit dusty.
-How's Elsa?
-She missed her mom. l did my best as a babysitter, but I'm afraid I'm not the type.
Do you Know, she sat out here all night long waiting for you?
Poor thing. And poor you, too, darling.
Come on, Elsa.
I'll find something nice for you.
George seemed so recovered from his attack of malaria...
...that we left for Kiunga the very next day...
...wondering how Elsa wouId react to the sight of her first ocean.
We reached Kiunga too late for anything...
...except to make camp and then meet the local fishermen...
...who had come to tell George about their troubles with the lion killing their goats.
Under the circumstances, Elsa's presence seemed to puzzIe them considerabIy.
We were tired and had fallen asleep quickIy.
But I was awakened by noises coming from near the cars and the kitchen.
There was no doubt that our cars, or our food...
...were providing a great temptation to someone.
I didn't want to wake George.
He had looked so tired and paIe when we arrived.
-George. George!
-What is it?
There's a lion out there. l think it's John's goat-eater.
Don't be silly.
No lion would come into camp. lt's probably a hyena, or a leopard or something.
No, it's a lion. I saw it. l was out there by the cook tent.
What were you doing....
All right.
Go back to bed.
Did you see him?
Yes, I saw him. Go to sleep.
Well, what happened?
I'd rather not discuss it. Go to sleep.
What are you doing?
Getting a drink of water.
Look, will you or will you not go to sleep?
That's that.
Work finished ahead of schedule.
From tomorrow, we play.
Marvelous watchdog you are!
ImmediateIy after our first waIk along the beach...
...we all trooped down to the water's edge to introduce EIsa to the Indian Ocean.
At first she was put off by the growl and rush of the waves...
...and the taste of the water.
And perhaps, by the audience we had collected...
...and which was looking on from a safe distance.
But soon her characteristic curiosity prevaiIed...
...and she enjoyed herseIf tremendousIy.
She loved playing almost any game George invented.
At the same time, she exhibited a talent for foothall that none of us had suspected.
It was a marvelous holiday.
Until one afternoon,
Nuru came panting down the beach...
...to tell me that something was terribIy wrong with Bwana George.
I ran to our camp.
Let me get the pills.
Joy!
Here, it's all right, darling.
It's all right!
Lie down.
There, that's all right. Just give me those.
Yes, you see, medicine can be very good...
...but too much medicine can be very bad, and he has taken too much...
...and he has been too active, too soon.
He might very well have died, you see.
Indeed, I'm surprised that he did not.
Goggle fishing too soon, too soon.
He seems to be an impetuous man.
True. He's a mad, impetuous boy.
Then we must curb his impetuosity.
No more goggling.
No. He must rest and then he will get well.
We'll see to it, Doctor.
Elsa will look after him.
She's a wonderful watchdog.
Yes. I see what you mean.
Goodbye.
-Thank you very much.
-Good luck.
You mad, impetuous boy.
Like all hoIidays, ours was over all too soon.
And it was the last we wouId ever take together.
The time was approaching when our Iives would be changed forever.
Elsa was fully grown now.
She had already been in season and was capabIe of having her own cubs...
...and she started to realize there was another life...
...than the one we had been living together.
A little later, our troubIes began.
You okay?
Sorry, but I Know that lioness.
She's a friend of mine.
-You're certain she's all right?
-Completely.
She and her friend Nuru came over to say hello...
...and then went on for a walk.
But it's a good thing I spotted her collar...
...or Mr. Watson might have claimed his first bag.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Adamson, I didn't know.
After all, you don't see a lion sitting in a tree every day.
No, I suppose not.
Actually, we're looking for elephants.
I've got my heart set on getting an elephant.
Well, we do get elephants here, but not for shooting. l don't understand.
They come each year for the maize and Brussels sprouts...
...which they love, and they're usually quite well-behaved.
They fascinate Elsa, I'm sorry to say.
This is elephant season now.
Really? Do you think we might get to see some? l shouldn't be surprised.
Memsahib, Elsa playing with the elephants.
Many elephants.
No. Sorry. Come along if you want to see some elephants.
Good.
Remember, they're just for looking at.
-No shooting unless it's necessary.
-l know. But let's go.
Come in the back, there's more room.
Okay!
A few moments Iater, when we passed through the shambles of a village...
...we saw one of the resuIts of Elsa's "playing" with the elephants.
As bad as it was, it was a great relief to learn that no one had been hurt.
But now I was dreadfuIIy afraid...
...that Elsa might have been trampIed by some angry eIephant.
And then we saw her...
...very happiIy bringing home a two-year-old souvenir of the occasion.
And the damage, I'm sorry to say, is considerable.
The complaints and bills for crop damage, et cetera, are still coming in...
...and will do so for some time to come.
The point is, I'm afraid, that you can't keep Elsa any longer.
I'm not responsible for the decision.
Don't you see?
Too many people know she was the cause of the stampede...
...and from now on she'll be blamed for any lost livestock or damage.
Or for anything that any wild lion or leopard might do.
On the other hand, she might very easily be shot by anyone.
I think you were lucky the last time.
She's too big now to be allowed to roam about...
...even with Nuru or yourselves.
And you can't keep her caged all the time...
...that would only frustrate her and could make her vicious.
I'm sorry, but I think you've got to find some zoo that will take her.
I'm certain you'll have no difficulty.
She'd make a wonderful attraction.
Well, we've always known that she....
John...
...I'm sure we can solve this in time.
That's the point, my dear.
There isn't very much time.
Your long leave has come through.
How soon?
In a month. So, you see....
Well, why couldn't we take it here, in this country?
-George wouldn't mind, right, dear?
-No.
Then we could have time--
You know government policies for a completely different climate.
I'm certain we could easily find a good zoo for her in a month.
I don't want her to go to a zoo.
I want to set her free.
You can't be serious.
You'd be sentencing her to death.
You might just as well shoot her here.
He's right. She can't fend for herself.
She's never killed to eat.
She'd starve out there in the bush.
We could teach her.
You've waited too long. lt's never been done successfully.
We could try.
You know how intelligent she is.
We could teach her, train her.
George, please, let's try.
I'm sorry, darling. I agree with John.
Even if we could show her how to hunt and kill...
...she'd never hold her own against wild lions.
I don't want to part with her any more than you do.
But what's wrong with sending her to a zoo?
Everything.
I know you think I'm being foolish, but I know Elsa.
We both know she'd be miserable in a zoo.
Don't you see? She's been free too long.
I can't let her be caged for the rest of her life.
John, as a friend, give us just a little more time.
Give us three months to try.
Please!
Please!
All right, my dear,
I'll get you your three months.
But you're wasting your time.
-Could I have another drink, please?
-Yes, of course.
If Elsa were to go wiId, it wouId have to be in another district...
...and we were able to get permission to take her to a reserve 340 miIes away...
...where there was abundant game, and best of all, many Iions.
Whatever George's reservations were, he did his best not to Iet me see them.
And I was gratefuI to him.
Our plan was to spend the first week...
...taking Elsa around the new country to get her used to it.
During the second week, we intended to leave her overnight...
...and to visit, and, if necessary, feed her in the mornings.
Afterwards, we intended to reduce her meaIs...
...in the hope that it wouId encourage her to kill on her own or to join a wild Iion.
Elsa, what are you doing?
That is not your dinner.
Put that back.
On schedule, the day came...
...when we took her out to leave her overnight for the first time.
Come on, Elsa, up you get.
Come on.
Come on. Today's the day.
If that's what I think it is....
Thanks.
Crikey. What a bit of lucK.
Right off the bat.
What a handsome fellow.
Let's keep our fingers crossed.
This could solve everything.
-Do you believe in love at first sight?
-I do now. I mean, I hope so.
-George, pray!
-I am!
So far, so good.
Why don't you get her down?
I think we should let her handle this.
All talk and no action.
Beautiful dialogue, though.
You're not funny, George.
I mean, we should give her more time.
-By all means. May I smoke?
-No.
This could go on forever.
I think you'd better get her down.
All right.
Wait!
We could use a little more room ourselves.
Come on, darling, get down.
Don't be afraid.
I'm sure you'll like him.
Come on, Elsa, get down.
There's a name for girls like her.
All I can say is I'm glad you didn't behave like that.
I take it you want to try again.
-Yes?
-I was just thinKing.
If there's anything left of that Kill, and Elsa can get to it...
...and with the fresh scent of lions on it, she just might get the general idea.
Well, that's good thinKing.
I have a thought.
If we take the kill to that fellow back there...
...and he thinks she's a good provider, he might get the general idea, too.
Right. Now it all depends on....
UnfortunateIy, it turned out to be a large pride...
...who thoroughIy and unhurriedIy enjoyed their family picnic.
It was severaI hours before we got to the remains of the zebra...
...and take it and Elsa back to the young bacheIor.
Luckily, he had remained near his tree.
But he was most annoyed by Elsa's ignorance of lion etiquette...
...which calls for the lioness to bring home the food...
...and then sit by until her lord and master has had his fill.
Poor Elsa, of course, didn't know that and was properly chastised.
That evening, we suffered all the agony of parents...
...whose teenage daughter is out on her first date.
We returned the next day, only to find Elsa minus both the young lion and her food.
She was so forlorn and so happy to see us...
...that I felt guilty about the entire episode.
We took her back to camp.
We resumed basic training.
According to plan, we'd cut down on her meals...
...hoping that hunger would encourage her to kill for food.
But to Elsa, stalking other animaIs was just a game she never took seriousIy.
And she obviousIy enjoyed herself so much that it was difficult to be angry with her.
George continued to take her out every day, without resuIt.
Then, one day, she suddenIy came upon a waethog.
But Elsa's inabiIity to feed herseIf...
...meant that George had to leave the reserve every day...
...and drive a very long distance to another area...
...where the shooting of game was allowed.
-Tired?
-Yes, I am, a little.
Have a drink.
Yes.
As the weeks sped by...
...we continued to leave her overnight as much as possibIe...
...only to find her in the morning right where we'd left her...
...hungry and patheticaIIy happy to see us.
Then, one night just before dawn....
It was Elsa, and it was soon apparent that she'd had some kind of encounter...
...with other lions, or perhaps a leopard, and had not come off too well.
Sweetie. George.
I can't think how she managed to find us.
Yes, she does all the wrong things right.
Sorry.
After that, she refused to venture out of camp.
Nice.
Yes, it is, isn't it?
-Have you any idea what time it is?
-I left my watch in the tent.
No, I meant the time of year.
We've only two weeks left.
The rains will be on us soon.
Yes, I know. I know.
I've been thinking.
We've got to take Elsa out, and leave her for at least a week...
...and we've got to move camp so that she can't find us.
Make or break, is that it?
Yes, I'm afraid so.
All right.
You've missed out that pretty bit over there.
Did I?
Yes.
At last, both the week and the rains came to an end.
Well, let's try this.
All my nightmares had come true.
It won't do.
Look, by now it's obvious she can't make it.
She can't fend for herself, mix with her own Kind...
...or do anything a wild lion must do to survive.
We've....
You've done too good a job on her.
We've made her tame, and it's too late to try to let her go wild now.
All we're doing is making her miserable, torturing her.
How can you be so cruel?
Do you think I enjoy it?
I don't know what goes on in that head of yours anymore.
You have this fixed idea.
What's wrong with a zoo, anyway?
Nothing, except that she won't be free.
-And is freedom so important?
-Yes.
Yes!
She was born free, and she has the right to live free.
Why don't we live in a nice comfortable city? Other people do.
But we've chosen to live out here because it represents freedom. We can breathe.
-Because we're fit for it.
-So could she be! She can.
-She'll be safe in the zoo.
-Yes, safe.
And fat and lazy and dull...
...and stupid like some cow on a milking machine.
Joy...
...tell me the truth.
You just don't want to give her up.
What you're hoping is that she can stay out here wild but not too wild...
...so you can see her every now and then.
That's it, isn't it?
It's not the whole truth, but I don't deny I'd like it.
It's impossible! It can't happen.
Even if she should be able to go wild, which I doubt...
...that'd be the end.
You'd never see her again.
Then at least she'd be free.
She wouldn't be in a cage for the rest of her life.
And if she gets herself killed in the process?
I'd never forgive myself, I suppose.
AIthough, at one time, we were afraid she would die...
...Elsa did recover.
And when she did, she seemed somehow different.
Thanks to John...
...who was wonderfuIIy kind, despite his reservations...
...we were able to get a time extension...
...as well as permission to take her to another area...
...only 35 miIes from where she was born...
...and where George could shoot wild game.
Now, as if she knew what was required of her...
...she started going out aIone, sometimes for days at a time...
...only returning when she was hungry.
Then one day, when we'd followed her into the bush...
...she caught sight of another waethog.
Well, there's no doubt at all whose kill that is.
Congratulations.
After that, she proved again and again that she couId feed herseIf...
...and so when she came into season...
...we took her out for what became her most dangerous and final test.
No, don't.
I'm sorry.
I couldn't stand anymore.
It's all right. It's really all right.
She's done it. She's crossed the bridge.
She's wild now. And free.
You should be very happy. And proud.
We've....
You've done something no one else has ever done.
And you should be very proud.
I am...
...of her.
Well, you might at least stop laughing.
-George?
-Yes?
Suppose we never see her again?
We will. We'll come back.
We'll come here as soon as our leave is over...
...before we do anything else.
And we'll find out how she's been.
Thank you.
Thank you very much for everything.
We did go back.
We had only a week in which to find her.
We camped in the same spot, and went to look for her every day...
...hoping that we wouId see her...
...and wondering what she wouId be like if we did.
But we never found any trace of her.
Finally, it was our last day.
Wait.
Let's try just once more.
Nothing. We start back today.
Elsa and her babies stayed with us all the afternoon...
...and she made it quite clear that she was happy to be with us again.
I was dying to pick them up and hoId them, as I had done with Elsa and her sisters.
But I knew that it wouId be wrong.
They were wild...
...and it was better now that they remained wild.
Her master's voice.
Jump up, Elsa.
We saw her many times again, born free and living free.
We saw her many times again, born free and Iiving free.
But to us she was always the same:
Our friend, Elsa.
I'd like another shot at that prize money.
Okay for next Sunday?
No, Jim. It ain't okay.
- Now, look, Bice, I know...
- No, you look.
All of my drivers are 18, 19.
You're too old for these kid snorts.
You're liable to get hurt in there.
You used to be a big track driver.
Ain't you got no pride?
I ran out of pride when
I ran out of cars.
Jim, you gotta look at yourself.
Okay, you start out all right.
You win a couple of tracks, you think you're on your way.
But it didn't work out, did it?
Much obliged.
You need any money?
Nope.
Hey...
What do you do with this stuff?
It's for a friend.
Hey, how'd it go?
Okay.
- I brought you something.
- Oh, thanks.
Oh, the poor thing.
I'll find a good spot for it.
You got hurt again.
- So?
- One of these days, you're gonna get wiped out entirely.
Why you gotta be a driver?
Maybe that's not your thing, racing.
How about all those car agencies down on Van Ness?
I bet that a top mechanic there gets a lot of good bread laid on him.
What is the matter with everybody?
Can't you understand?
I'm not a mechanic.
I'm a driver.
I know just how you feel, Jim.
Hey, I used to think that I was happy painting flower seeds.
Then one day, inside me, there was this little voice, says,
"Tennessee Steinmetz."
I said, "What?"
It said, "You ain't happy." Well, I...
Tennessee, would you tell me something?
Why is it the only thing we ever have in this house is parrot food?
I mean, we don't have a parrot.
Hey, eat that. That's good.
That's pressed kelp.
That aerates your liver.
Then this voice inside of me continued as follows...
"This is nowhere. You gotta make a new scene.
"You gotta change your bag."
That's when I split.
I went to Tibet, to a mountaintop with swamis and monks.
I discovered my real self.
It was wonderful.
I don't have to go to Tibet.
I know who I am.
I know what I want.
Hey, there are dirt track races at a carnival near
Bakersfield this week.
If I can get over there, I can pick up a couple of bucks.
Okay to use your wheels?
Yeah, okay, but I'm afraid you're gonna have a little trouble getting it started.
Where's the beast?
You didn't cut up the Edsel?
Came over me all of a sudden.
It was the only decent thing to do.
Believe me, Jim. It'll be happier up there.
Are you all right? Are you dizzy?
Oh, no. Well, there's a slight racking pain in my head.
Oh, I think you'd better sit down.
I'm really terribly sorry.
Well, it's not your fault.
I didn't mean to startle you.
Looks like you've been running into all sorts of things lately.
Yeah. Oh, oh, this is just a little...
Oh, lady.
Oh, really, sir.
Excuse me.
Over 400 cubes...
Dual quads, all synchro box, zero to 60 under five.
All right, Miss Bennett, I'll see to this gentleman myself.
May I be of service, sir?
I see that you're a person who appreciates fine things.
You're no doubt aware that this is the celebrated Thorndyke special.
And allow me to say, sir, that I think this car would suit you very well.
Yes. Yes, it would.
Yes, may I offer you a glass of sherry and a biscuit?
Go right ahead.
I take it that the question of price does not greatly concern a gentleman like yourself.
Oh, I wouldn't haggle, if that's what you mean.
What price range did you have in mind?
About $75.
I could go 80 in a pinch.
What do you have in the way of cheap, honest transportation?
Cheap, honest transportation.
I will bid you good day, sir.
Good day.
Hey.
Havershaw.
Now, where did this come from?
Mr. Thorndyke, yes, sir?
What is this thing doing in my showroom, may I ask?
Oh, I believe Miss Bennett may know something about this.
Yes, you remember when Mrs. Van
Luit purchased her new Bentley?
Well, she also requested us to buy a small used car for her upstairs maid.
Then why isn't her upstairs maid in her blasted vehicle?
The car was returned this morning, Mr. Thorndyke.
She was having some kind of difficulty with it.
- Get it out of here.
- Yes, sir.
What's that for?
I beg your pardon?
Why don't you let the little car alone?
Are you presuming to tell me what to do in my own establishment?
Okay, I'm outta line.
It just bugs me to see somebody abusing a decent piece of machinery.
Fascinating.
Well, now that we've had the benefit of your point of view, shall we regard our relationship as terminated?
Havershaw.
Get this eyesore out of my showroom.
And if ever I find it here again, someone is going to find himself in a great deal of trouble.
Yes, sir. Watch your knees there, boys.
Here we go.
Sorry. None of my business, is it?
Perfectly all right.
Goodbye.
Oh, goodbye.
Good morning.
Good morning. What do you want?
Police.
Right. What do you want?
Forgive me for pointing, but have you ever seen that car before?
No. No, I haven't.
Hey, he's a cute little fella.
Hey, wait a minute.
I think I saw that car at an agency yesterday.
Now permit me to inform you of the following.
First, say nothing that would jeopardise your constitutional rights.
Second, the minute that you get downtown,
I would advise that you get a good lawyer.
Shall we go?
Go? What for?
On suspicion of grand theft.
Look, now, wait a minute. There's something cock-eyed about this.
How did that little car get here?
I share your curiosity.
Shall we go?
I'll do it. Okay.
I'll do it, but I just want to go on record. I have seen some crummy stunts in my time used to sell cars, but this beats everything.
To plant this bug in the possession of an innocent man and then to accuse me of stealing it.
How dare you, sir.
Are you suggesting that I would stoop to such tactics?
That's exactly what
I'm suggesting.
In the first place, it might interest you to know that under normal circumstances,
I would never sell a car to someone with whom I'm not, well, shall we say, socially compatible.
Socially compatible?
Please, please, let's not go through that again.
I think we've worked it out very well.
Mr. Douglas needs a car, and for a very low amount down, and the usual monthly payments, the car will become his.
Very well, even though my personal inclination is to have Mr. Douglas tapped into jail, and this four-wheel contrivance dropped into the bay.
I think Mr. Thorndyke is being very fair.
Fair? It's not fair.
I'm being muscled.
I just want you to know that I know
I know it, and I don't like it.
I'll draw up the papers. Would you come with me, please?
Then get Mr. Douglas and his acquisition out of here before
I lose my temper.
What the...
What's the matter? You from LA or something?
Fine. I thought we'd run over to that new restaurant...
Have you gone mad?
Okay, what's the joke?
What do you mean?
I don't know how you rigged it, but I'm sure that car's a real cutup when a convention comes to town.
If I wanted a trick car, I would've bought one in a joke shop.
Allow me to say that I haven't the slightest idea what you're talking about.
You come blithering up in that beastly little car, and assault my personal Rolls-Royce.
I brought it back.
I want my money,
I want the papers I signed, and then I'll get out of here, and you two clowns can have your little laugh.
Mr. Douglas, if there is anything wrong with the car, would you be good enough to tell me what it is?
There's nothing essentially wrong with the car.
It's just that it wants to go one way, and I'd like to go the other.
Whatever it is, none of it is covered in our gilt-edged guarantee.
Oh, I'm sure of that.
If you examine paragraph 12...
Excuse me, Mr. Thorndyke, but if I sold this gentleman the car,
I feel a certain responsibility.
Do you mind if I try it?
Miss Bennett.
Our dinner engagement.
I won't be a minute.
Seems to be acting all right now.
Sometimes new car owners have a tendency to exaggerate their problems.
We get that all the time.
Believe me, when I was in this car alone, it was...
Just treat it gently at first.
It really is quite a fine little automobile.
Have you had much experience with cars?
Look, lady, by profession,
I'm a racing driver.
Oh, that Jim Douglas.
What do you mean,
"That Jim Douglas"?
Let's see. Two years ago at
Laguna Seca, you spun out, and hung a beautiful Buick
Special on the back fence.
At Willow Springs... Was it a year ago last February?
You sprayed a Lotus all over the infield.
How do you know all that?
I have trouble with names and faces, but I never forget a car.
I like good machinery.
Now, why don't you give this little car a fair chance?
You bought it. Enjoy it.
You can drive me back now.
How about it, Dad?
Want to give that doodlebug a workout?
I'll go easy on you.
Be serious, will you?
Did you see this thing take off?
One of your showboat tricks, Mr. Douglas?
I tell you, I had nothing to do with it.
Hey, we were turning.
Out of sight, man.
I wouldn't have believed it.
Groovy, Pop. Groovy.
Well, as long as the customer finally seems pleased,
I'll just step out and find myself a taxi.
Will you stop the car, please?
I'm trying. Look.
It's just like I told you.
This thing's starting to act up again.
How very odd. When I was driving, there was no problem whatsoever.
I can't seem to do anything with it.
Mr. Douglas, I'm asking you nicely to pull over to that kerb and let me out.
Look, I'm sorry about your date. I really am.
I didn't want you to miss your dinner engagement.
What's the rush, tiger?
We got all night.
Goodbye, Mr. Douglas.
Here, I'll help you.
I can get out, thank you.
What'll it be, chief?
Oh, hey, look, we have a little problem here.
Would you mind helping the young lady get her car door open?
Look, I'm busy.
And furthermore, I ain't no mechanic.
All I do here is sell food, and that ain't too good.
You want something, or don't you?
- Help.
- Two hamburgers and a coffee.
Help.
Can you help me, please?
Help. I'm a prisoner.
I can't get out.
We all prisoners, chickie baby.
We all locked in.
A couple of weirdos, Guinevere.
What... Wait a minute, now.
Hold it, hold it.
Let me open the door.
Hey, knock it off, will you, sis?
I ain't saying this is the classiest joint in town, but we gotta draw the line somewhere.
Come on, back in your seat.
Why don't you go up to Seabreeze Point?
Fuzz don't bother you much up there.
Thanks.
I wish there was some way I could make up for those hamburgers.
Mr. Douglas, please don't go on about it.
I'm quite sure that if I were driving, none of these things would've happened.
It's all yours.
Now I think you'll see what's what.
This is very embarrassing.
Yes, it is.
I would've preferred knowing you a little longer first.
Just a minute.
You don't for one solitary instant dare to think that I drove you here on purpose?
Oh, don't try to explain.
The point is, you brought me here.
I did not bring you here.
It's this nasty little car.
But you said yourself earlier, it's a very nice little car.
And as you said before, it does have some peculiar traits, and I agree with you completely.
As a matter of fact, bring it in tomorrow, and I'll find a replacement for you.
I don't want the car replaced.
As a matter of fact, I'm beginning to like it.
Oh.
Don't panic, don't panic.
There must be some place
I can call a taxi.
Hey.
You know, for a moment there, I thought you weren't going to stop.
What's the matter now?
Hey, look, this is ridiculous.
Let's get back in the car, huh?
Hold it. Hold it, everybody.
Just a moment, please.
Something the matter?
Is this man bothering you?
No, not exactly.
It's okay, we're together.
Is that your car?
My...
Well, yes. Yes it is.
Okay, then. Move along.
- Hey, bud.
- Yeah?
Not too smart wandering around the park at night.
Right.
I'll drive.
She'll drive.
I should've given you a citation.
You ought to have enough sense to put your brakes on while your car is stopped.
Well, then if everything that you say about this car is true, it's already starting to happen.
What's starting to happen?
Us human beings.
We had a chance to make something out of this world.
We blew it. Okay.
Another kind of a civilisation is gonna take a turn.
Give me an 11 mil wrench, will ya?
I'm sitting up on top of this mountain, right?
Right.
I'm surrounded by these gurus and swamis and monks, right?
- Right.
- I'm looking at my stomach,
I'm knocking back a little rice wine.
Got some contemplation going.
I see things like they are.
I could have told you all this was coming.
What's coming?
Jim, it's happening right under our noses, and we can't see it.
We take machines, and we stuff them with information, until they're smarter than we are.
Take a car.
Most guys spread more love and time and money on a car in a week than they do on their wife and kids in a year.
Pretty soon, you know what?
The machine starts to think it is somebody.
I'm not saying that a mechanical thing, it can't be a friend.
Like, when I was broke one summer, there was this giant claw machine in the Sutro Amusement Park.
And it would grab cameras and watches, and drop them down a hole to me.
And I would hawk them and buy lunch.
- You follow me?
- Yeah, yeah.
I think you were up on that mountaintop too long.
Contrariwise, the traffic light down the street hates my guts.
I don't know why, but in the last six weeks,
I haven't caught anything but a stop signal.
And it makes me wait six seconds longer than anybody else. I timed it.
There's things like that happen to lots of other people, too.
But the other people, they don't tell no other people, because the other people would say,
Tennessee, that traffic light is a lot of nuts and bolts.
This little car, lot of nuts and bolts.
Everything explains itself one way or the other.
You're not listening to me.
Don't lose your grip, old buddy.
This little car didn't do one thing tonight that can't be explained in terms of short circuits, sprung doors, grabbing steering, worn knuckles...
Maybe some advertising gimmick.
I'll fix it.
I don't think you got the picture.
I got a beautiful picture.
This baby happens to have an extra turn of speed, which is the only thing I care about.
You don't understand what happens, do you?
They make 10,000 cars, they make them exactly the same way, and one or two of them turn out to be something special.
Nobody knows why.
I know why.
I may be kidding myself, but I think I can make something out of that sad little bucket of bolts.
Save these. They'll be famous someday.
I'm your friend.
Want to take a ride?
I want to check those adjustments I made last night.
- Okay.
- Be right with you.
Hey. Come here.
All right, you guys, get out of there.
Out. Come on.
Who do you guys think you are?
Stop clowning around, will you?
Play it straight.
Don't give him any trouble.
You could have a good home here.
What's all that racket?
- Nothing, nothing.
- Oh. Hop in.
What'd I tell you?
Now it handles good.
All the bugs are gone.
Herbie's all right.
Who's Herbie?
This little car, named after my Uncle Herb.
He used to box middleweight.
Preliminary mostly.
Gradually his nose got shaped more and more like to remind me of this little car.
Do you mind?
Whatever you say, Tennessee.
Herbie.
I'll take them.
Thank you, sir.
What's that for?
An oil job.
Huh?
I got a small knock in my conscience.
Thanks.
Now we get down to business.
You gonna race?
What do you think?
Oh, boy, won't Herbie love that.
Le Mans, Monte-Carlo, thrills, glamour, the roar of the crowd.
He really does drive.
If you could give me one good reason for bringing me down to this ridiculous desert...
Isn't that the scruffy little car we had in the shop?
Now we're going.
You're doing terrific, Herbie, but don't make it look too easy.
Play it smart.
Okay, Jim, go ahead.
You're raring now.
So who cares? I'll tell you one thing,
I certainly don't intend losing any sleep over that absurd car.
Come on. Come on.
Now, Herbie, now. Now.
The winner, number 53,
Jim Douglas, driving a class D special.
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.
- Good race, Jim.
- Thanks, Ray.
Oh boy, was Herbie ever great today.
Hey, I was out there, too.
Wouldn't you say that was a fair piece of driving?
Hey, I'm not trying to take anything away from you, but you gotta admit that this little guy backed you all the way.
Yep. It's a nice little car.
You know something else?
For the first time in a long while, I felt my real self out there today.
I mean, a sense of authority, like the top drivers have, you know?
I kind of felt you felt that.
Tennessee, I wouldn't admit this to anybody else, but I was beginning to think
I'd never be anything more than a piston-happy, lead-foot punk.
Then this starts to happen.
I'm glad for you, Jim.
You know that.
Well, hello.
I see you finally learned how to handle this car.
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.
What have you done to this thing?
Oh, an adjustment here, an adjustment there.
Do you want to sell it back?
I own most of it anyway, you know.
Still 23 payments to go.
Well...
I'll tell you what
I'll do. I'll take the car and give you $1,000 clear.
Now what do you say to that?
No. You don't want to do that.
It's all right, Tennessee.
I know what I'm doing.
I think Mr. Thorndyke is a little mixed up as to who or what won that race.
And what does that mean?
Someday I'll teach you not to confuse the car with the driver.
I should welcome the opportunity.
Mr. Thorndyke, I think that's a very good idea of yours.
What is?
You're racing in the Libra Open at
Riverside the end of the month, right?
Yes.
I'm sure that Mr. Douglas would like to get the remainder of his payments off his back.
No doubt.
But why should I think that's such a good idea?
Well, if Mr. Douglas entered the race, he could bet his share of the little car against the remaining payment.
What do you say, Douglas?
Winner to become the sole owner of the car.
A moment ago you mentioned teaching me a lesson.
Do I now detect a note of timidity?
Racing.
That's the name of the game, isn't it?
Win or lose, put up or shut up.
You got yourself a deal, Thorndyke.
Splendid.
The drivers' meeting is over.
Now the third race of the afternoon will get underway here at Riverside.
You keep your eye on your friend in the bug, my dear.
I'm going to squash him.
Clear the grid.
Clear the grid, please.
Can't help feeling yippie.
If anything goes wrong, we lose Herbie altogether.
I thought you were the guy with all the faith in this car.
Yeah, I got it, yeah.
And now the starter has his flag in the air.
The engines are started, and in just a moment we'll have the start.
All the cars looking very smart on the grid.
Drivers signify that they're ready to race with their hands extended in the air.
The flag is up, and there they go.
All cars getting off to a very nice start.
Off the grid on the way to turn one.
We'll see how they shape up as they go into turn one.
Cars stretching out now.
All cars off the starting grid and through turn one.
To the open now.
Down the backstretch, all by himself now.
Here is the number
14 car of Thorndyke going into the sweeper turn.
The rest of the field all stretched out as they charge down the backstretch.
Not yet, Herbie. Not yet.
The standings at lap 23...
Thorndyke still leading,
Lesser running second, and Erwin in third place.
Now, Herbie, now.
Now car number 53, Douglas, starts to make a move.
Picking up cars as he goes by car number 20, into the sweeper very hard and fast.
Going through traffic, passing number 23 now, is car number 53, Douglas.
He has just come alive and is making a challenge in this race.
Passing cars as he goes down the back-straight.
Car number 53, Douglas, making his bid.
Into the straight now is
Thorndyke, car number 14.
Now the pressure's on.
Douglas, number 53, is drawing close on Thorndyke in the number 14 car.
Douglas has just come alive and is pressing the leader now.
Now making his bid to pass but he can't get by.
He's being shut off by Thorndyke in the number 14 car.
Goes slightly off course, takes out some oranges, and apparently is out of control.
And goes crashing into the number four shut off card.
Thorndyke continuing on as the number 53 car left...
Now he's making his re-entry.
Look out.
Hey, nice going, champ.
Thank you very much.
Hey, what a champ. Way to drive.
Just a moment, Mr.
Thorndyke, you don't have...
I demand that this thing is impounded and checked.
I tell you, there's more going on here than meets the eye.
Mucha luck, señor.
Thank you.
A usted también.
You don't look well in these pictures lately.
How could I look well?
I haven't been able to sleep.
That rotten car is driving me piffy.
Has it occurred to you that it may not be the rotten car?
Perhaps it's the way
Mr. Douglas drives.
Balderdash. There isn't a driver in the world who can get that speed out of a car like that.
No, he's done something to it, and I've got to find out what.
You've become obsessed by this whole thing.
There are other cars, other races.
Why don't you just forget it?
My dear child, how little you know me.
Yes, Mr. Thorndyke.
Carole?
How long have you been with us?
A year and a half, almost two. Why?
You know, I'm afraid I've been a little remiss in not telling you long before now how very well you've proved in all your duties.
Well, thank you.
And Carole?
As I realise you have the best interests of this organisation at heart,
I want you to accede to a somewhat unusual request.
Oh?
Peter Thorndyke.
It's for you.
All right, you can take it here.
Thank you.
Yes, good afternoon.
Oh, I think that should be quite all right.
7:30 will be fine.
Yes, bye.
I think I'll...
I'd like you to see this Douglas fellow.
Get to know him.
Who knows? If he has the talents of which I believe him capable, perhaps we can give him the opportunity of joining our organisation, racing under our colours, but first we must know something about him.
- How about tonight?
- Very good.
At 7:30?
Very good. Why waste time?
Oh, and, Carole, another thing.
Leave your car.
Take the special.
He likes that one.
Thank you.
I think I ought to tell you that that was Mr. Douglas who just called.
Excellent. Strike while the iron is hot.
In all honesty, I should like to point out that I agreed to have dinner with him before you suggested it.
Well, I salute your honesty, my dear.
A quality not necessarily to be despised.
Thank you.
A very loyal girl.
Got Herbie all polished out for you.
Carole Bennett called back.
She's gonna pick me up in the special.
You mean you're not taking Herbie?
He's looking forward to some relaxation just like you are.
The car is...
See you later, Tennessee.
Some thanks after what
Herbie did for you.
Don't let it get you, Herbie.
Jim didn't mean it.
Don't forget, he isn't the first guy ever to lose his head over a bucket seat and a paint job.
He'll come to his senses.
Good evening.
Sorry, the other rats are out for the evening.
No, no, please.
I didn't come by to see Mr. Douglas.
I just came by to pay my respects to that gallant little car.
Huh?
There it is.
What a marvel it is, indeed.
I don't get you, fella.
Oh, come, come, sir, I know a rare bit of machinery when I see one.
And after all, who should know it better than I?
I, who have been trounced time and again by this paragon.
You will forgive me for saying so, sir, but it does take class to know when it has been defeated by class.
You know something, Mr. Thorndyke,
I may have misjudged you.
Well, thank you.
I've been misjudging a lot of people lately.
Would you like a drink?
Some Irish coffee?
Speciality of the house, my own mother's recipe.
That's very kind of you, I'd love it.
I'll be back in a jiffy.
Well, that's most kind.
Thank you so much.
It's just incredible, isn't it, to think that this innocent-seeming object is capable of such great deeds.
How, indeed.
The trick is, always remember to have asbestos gloves when you make coffee this way.
Definitely, yes.
Yes, quite fascinating.
Here we go.
Ooh. Oh. Oh...
How very refreshing.
Well, thank you.
Up the Irish.
To the little car, a gallant adversary, and may the best car win at Riverside.
- May the best car win.
- Yes.
Oh, that's very good, isn't it?
Very good, indeed.
Like it?
What do you think?
I can't stand that hungry look any longer.
Take over.
You know what I said to myself the first time I saw you?
What?
I said to myself, now, there's a real lady.
This is how it ought to be.
Me and these kind of wheels.
Excuse me asking, but aren't you doing all right with the little car?
Sure.
But can you imagine how I'd make it with equipment like this?
Is it so important to you?
Without a real car,
I'm only half a man.
What part of Ireland did you say your mother came from?
Coney Ireland.
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
I'm gonna make some more coffee.
Well, would you like a spot of this?
I like a spot of anything.
I'm so sorry.
Then we're gonna drink to Herbie.
Greatest little car in the whole world.
Yes, quite right. Hear, hear.
Hear, hear.
To Herbie.
To Herbie. I'm so sorry about your hand.
I do apologise.
Herbie.
What do you know?
The engine stalled.
How about that? Door's stuck.
That's how it is with cars sometimes.
Yes.
Guess we'll have to wait and see what happens next.
Well, as someone very wisely once said,
"That's how it is with cars sometimes."
I just said that.
Oh.
I wonder if your reputation is altogether true.
What's my reputation?
Oh, I've heard that Jim Douglas is only interested in fast cars and easy money.
Not true.
Oh?
You know something else?
What?
When the light hits you just right, you're as beautiful as General
Grant on the $50 bill.
Oh, dear me.
You want to know the secret of the little car?
I do, indeed.
I'll tell you the secret of the little car.
No, just a minute.
All right, tell me.
It's heart.
That's what it is... Heart.
Heart.
Yes, well, I'm certainly going to make a note of that.
Headache gone?
All gone.
Anticipation of victory is the purest form of aspirin.
This is my day.
Clear the grid.
Clear the grid, please.
You seem very confident.
You know, I believe I am.
There is some passing as they leave the starting grid.
Going for turn one.
Field stretching out now.
Everybody into the turn went very nicely.
Very fine field of cars here, and coming through traffic now, making a move is Peter Thorndyke in the number 14 car, picking up a few cars in that turn.
Now he comes by and picks up three more cars, going into the lead now.
Thorndyke leading this race in car number 14.
Now making a move is car number 53, Douglas, who also picks up about three cars as he goes charging into the traffic, and is in hot pursuit of
Thorndyke in the number 14 car.
As they go down the back-straight, coming on very hard to pass now and Douglas, number
53, making the pass.
Attaway, Jimmy boy.
Go, Jimmy. Ha, ha, ha.
So far Jim Douglas seems to have everything pretty much to himself.
He comes through the S's into turn six well in control.
As we come down the back-straight,
Douglas is slowing down and Thorndyke goes rocketing by into the sweeper turn.
It looks as though the Douglas car is having trouble.
Yes, number 53 is fading fast.
It is developing a problem of some kind.
Come in. Come in.
Come in.
Irish coffee.
I'll be here all night if necessary. Ha, ha, ha.
I can take any amount of this.
Right, there we are.
Don't worry, little guy.
You'll be home soon.
There we are.
Right, right you are.
Do you mind standing clear?
They want me on my own.
I'll see you in a minute.
Poor little fella.
You got a temperature.
Don't worry, Jim will be back soon.
He never would have left if it hadn't been something important.
I know, nothing worse than an Irish coffee hangover.
That you, Jim?
Mind if I come in?
Sure, come on.
I wouldn't blame you if you threw me out.
On account of what Thorndyke did?
How can I blame anyone?
Thorndyke ruined the little car right under my nose.
- Where's Jim?
- Don't know.
He went out as soon as we got back.
Didn't say a word.
Left Herbie and me flat.
Doesn't he take care of his car after a race?
Can you do something?
Like what?
Well, help the little car.
I'm not a mechanic, but
I think it's suffering.
Suffering?
Please.
Mind if I use those coveralls?
Right.
Oh, look, I want to tell you so you don't have to worry.
I'm not with Peter
Thorndyke any more.
I don't think his way.
Oh, I know that.
How do you know?
Well, Herbie wouldn't like you, otherwise.
Herbie wouldn't like me?
Miss Bennett...
I gotta level with somebody.
I can't talk to Jim.
Oh, it would destroy him.
You don't know what it was like before the little car came along.
Jim was defeated. It was murder.
He couldn't get a job.
He got into trouble.
Everybody was on his back.
Then Herbie came into his life.
You remember that day?
I remember.
Well, Jim started winning races again, he got his self-respect back.
What am I gonna do?
Tell him that it was Herbie winning those races, not him?
Was it Herbie?
Well, I...
You fix the little car.
I'll tell you what's going on.
I didn't know nothing.
Then I went to Tibet.
I plugged into this contemplation thing...
How's that sound?
Like the song of a bluebird.
Well, the fuel lines are clean, plugs are clean, wiring checks out.
Looks like we're in pretty good shape.
Herbie and I sure appreciate it.
You don't believe a word I said about this little car, do you?
Well, there's always a first time.
I imagine Adam thought woman was a pretty funny piece of equipment when he met Eve.
Well, that's a start.
You can't believe it all right away.
It takes time.
- Well, hello there.
- Hi.
What's this?
You ever see anything so beautiful?
Very nice.
What's the big idea?
You already got a car.
Not after what happened today I don't.
Ah, shut up. You want
Herbie to hear you?
Now don't start that again, Tennessee.
Look, the El Dorado is coming up.
There are real cars lined up in there.
I need something that can cut it.
Herbie's cut it so far, hasn't he?
Of course he has.
Now, hold it, you two.
I've done great with this little car so far, thanks to a few changes I made and, if you don't mind, some pretty fair country driving.
But I gotta stop kidding myself.
I need a big, strong car.
Now I got it.
Don't pay any attention.
Don't even look at it.
Hello?
Peter Thorndyke here.
Well, well.
Yeah, yeah, Thorndyke, I know what you did to my car.
You need your brains kicked out.
Well, you can imagine how I must feel.
You see, I'm simply not responsible when I've been drinking.
You know how it is.
Forget it. And goodbye.
Wait, wait, wait.
I understand from a friend of mine that you purchased a new Lamborghini today.
So?
I'm also informed that you owe a great deal of money on it.
Now, myself, for sentimental reasons, I like the little car, and I'm perfectly willing to increase my previous offer and give you $1,500 for it.
Now, immediately.
I'm in the vicinity.
Thorndyke, I don't like you.
But I can use your money.
You got yourself a deal. Come and get it.
What do you mean you got yourself a deal?
- I'm selling the little car.
- You're what?
Don't make a fuss.
I need the money.
You crumb. You can't do that to Herbie.
Carole, will you tell him how it is?
Out in the real world?
Me? Ha.
Well, near as I can figure it,
I'm not too smart either.
I get rid of one heel just in time to find another.
Well, now, what happened to you?
I thought you'd be on my side.
Not when you do something like this to Herbie.
Has everybody gone nuts around here?
I can understand how
Tennessee feels.
He's just in off a flying saucer. But you... I thought you made sense.
Something tells me it's very, very wrong to sell that little car.
Well, thank you for your opinion, but what am I supposed to do?
Now, I need the money.
Tennessee, if I don't sell...
Don't talk to me.
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have butted in.
You're absolutely right.
As a matter of fact,
I don't know...
What are you doing here?
I wish I knew.
I really wish I knew.
If I weren't so young and innocent, a certain thought might enter my mind.
Such as?
Such as you went out with me last night so that Thorndyke could get a shot at the little car.
Is that what you think?
You gotta admit it's tempting.
Okay. Okay, you want to know what I was doing here?
Well, I felt sorry about what happened today.
So I quit Thorndyke and came over here like a full-grown idiot to find out if I could make up for it in some way.
Well, isn't that a beautiful thought for the day?
Very touching. Makes me glow.
I think it's just about time someone told you what the score is.
You see, Tennessee's too tender-hearted.
You really think it was you winning those races?
Yes, I think it was me winning...
What do you mean it wasn't me winning...
Pardon me.
All right. Do you want me to tell you something, my windbag friend?
I admit, I didn't believe it when Tennessee told me before, but now I see it makes all kinds of sense.
What?
That thimble head of yours has gotten all swelled up.
You're not winning any of those races.
You couldn't win a game of marbles from a 12-toed myopic rhinoceros.
Let me... Will you knock it off out there, Tennessee?
Can't hear myself think.
I'm not out there, crumb, I'm here.
Well, hold it down. I'll...
Well, then what's this noise?
No.
Stop it. Stop it. You don't know what you're doing.
Look. Look what it did to my car.
Okay, okay, maybe it was a little jealous.
Of course it's jealous.
It's always been jealous because I get credit for winning those races.
Go on. Realise what you're saying?
At a time like this, whatever kind of time it is,
I always say that money serves to ease the pain.
Good evening, my dear.
Here you are, sir.
$1,500 for the small car, just as I promised.
I note it's not in mint condition, but I am nothing if not always a man of my word.
What about 2,000?
It's the least I can do to help a fellow human at a time like this.
Shall we consider it a deal?
Yes.
$2,000 for that little beat-up car. Why?
Well, I suppose you could say I have a warm place in my heart for the dear little thing.
You don't have a warm place on your whole body.
What do you want it for?
You don't want it. I do. Take the money.
- You. You, too.
- There's no need to be abusive.
I'm simply trying to give you some money.
I don't want your money. What do you want the car for?
Well, I...
You believe it. You believe it, too.
Believe what?
Jim, it don't matter whether you believe Herbie or not.
Herbie don't believe in you no more.
What?
Well, where'd he go? Where is he?
Took off. What do you expect?
Well, come on, let's find him.
This is a private thing between the two of you.
Good luck.
Herbie.
Herbie.
A rum lot you've taken up with, my dear.
You better find that car before I do, my friend.
Operator.
Mobile KQX2942,
I want 567-3998.
Havershaw? I shall require the personnel of both our day and night shifts.
We have a small task to perform.
Herbie.
Herbie.
That's it.
Herbie.
Excuse me.
Havershaw, tear it apart.
All right, boys, you heard Mr.
Thorndyke. Tear it apart.
I'm gonna find out what makes it tick.
- After it.
- After it.
Go on, grab the brute.
Hang onto it, you fools. Hang on.
Herbie.
Give me police station.
Hello. Police station.
Herbie.
Hey, you.
Did a little car come by here?
Yeah, just did without paying the...
No, Herbie. Don't.
Herbie.
Herb. Back up.
Herbie?
Come on, baby, it's gonna be a beautiful day tomorrow.
Oh.
Herbie, give me some help.
Herb?
I can't hang on much longer.
Boy, was he lucky.
This little car saved his life.
What do you mean, the car saved his life?
That's what it looked like for a moment there...
You know how funny things can look in the fog sometimes.
I think you've been up on that
Haight-Ashbury beat too long.
Swing that light over here.
Aha.
- What's that thing?
- It's a dried squid, Sergeant.
- Here's the damages.
- Can you pay it?
I'm sorry. I have no money.
Then your car will be impounded.
My guess is, the judge will order you to sell it at auction and the proceeds given to Mr. Wu.
Wait a minute.
May I please speak to the gentleman, please?
I spent some time up on a Chinese-type mountain teaching English to some of them.
You taught English?
Let's don't get personal. It's a matter of talking their language.
You have a little feel for tradition and some courtesy, you'd be surprised.
You can unscrut the inscrutable.
Go ahead.
Ah...
- Herbie?
- Herbie.
Oh.
Oh. Things are shaping up.
He's a car buff.
Good, good.
Wow.
- What's the matter?
- We just got a new problem.
He likes the car so much he wants to keep it.
Okay, the car is his, but he has to let me drive it in the El Dorado.
Now, if I win, tell him he gets to keep the prize money, but he has to sell Herbie back to me for a dollar.
Now you speak my language.
Attention, drivers and owners, report to Mr. Granatelli at the president's headquarters.
Further, you must remain on the secondary roads, which have been posted for this race.
Other than that, we've tried to reduce the rules to a minimum.
Instead of all this technical mamby-pamby there's so much of today, we're putting the emphasis on speed, endurance, and courage.
The way it used to be.
As you know, this is open formula racing.
Anything goes.
Any style of car and crew you wish.
The object, gentlemen, is to win.
I wish you all the very best of luck.
Tang Wu, I understand that you are the new owner of the Douglas car.
As I, too, am interested in the vehicle,
I took the liberty of looking you up.
Thank you.
You will therefore forgive me, sir, when I say that you are perhaps not quite as naive as you look.
In point of fact, you are a very shrewd operator, one who has managed to acquire, by one means or another, legitimate means, of course, a number of varied enterprises.
It is truly written, one cannot lose them all.
In the light of this, would you entertain a sizeable wager on the outcome of the race?
Wager?
The goddess of fortune will always find me her most ardent suitor.
Splendid, splendid.
Shall we step in here?
A little more private.
You're Mr. Thorndyke. I've always wanted to meet you.
You've heard of me? How charming.
Are you not the gentleman who originated the idea of small print on bottom of automobile sales contract?
The very same.
A most worthy adversary.
You are most kind.
And now, sir, the terms of our wager.
What would you like?
What have you got?
Ahem.
Okay, let's mount up.
How's our little friend?
I hope it holds together.
Holds together?
It was so beat up, I had to cut the frame to straighten it out.
Excuse me.
Is this the morning bus to Fresno?
Thorndyke, this little car goes so fast, we need three people inside just to hold it on the ground.
Well, you certainly picked the right crew.
Toodle-oo.
Break a leg, Thorndyke.
Havershaw, I trust you've not been wasting your time.
Spent a few useful moments with the small car?
Yes, sir.
Based then on what you now know, what would you say are the chances of victory for the Douglas car?
I would say that they range from slight to impossible.
Havershaw, you are a rat after my own heart.
Thank you, sir.
Gentlemen, start your engines.
You're giving it a nice ride.
Okay to uncurl my toes now? We past everybody?
Everyone but Thorndyke.
Let's go to work.
They're coming up on us, sir.
Well, we're not too concerned, are we?
Now, Havershaw, aren't we coming to that rather dangerous, oily spot in the road?
Coming right up, sir.
Come on, push.
Push, you worm.
Jim, that's water.
Here we go.
Mr. Thorndyke, that isn't me.
Give me something to wipe my goggles.
Havershaw, did you ever think of having a manicure?
There they are.
Now watch me blow them off the road.
Who's the guy in the fur coat?
This is no time for eating, you fool.
Where are we? How far is Chinese Camp?
What's the matter with you?
Don't you even know how to open a map?
At the moment, the leaders of the race are approaching the historic mining towns of the mother lode.
In first position, as he moves past checkpoint three, is Jim Douglas.
Peter Thorndyke, in the special, has regained his relief driver and is rapidly making up lost ground as the two pacemakers near the famous old mining community of Chinese Camp.
- Now what?
- I don't know.
We can't be out of gas this soon.
Here.
Wait a minute. I got a suspicion.
What's the matter?
Just as I thought... Water.
They did it again.
Now what do we do?
Give me the map.
All right, it looks like Chinese
Camp's about three miles from here.
Now, if we come down the...
Hey.
What goes?
No sweat, man.
This is Uncle Wu's car.
You don't think he'd let anyone put it down, do you?
Easy, fellas.
The Jim Douglas car appears to have run into trouble.
There has been no sign of him past checkpoint nine.
Peter Thorndyke is refuelling at Chinese Camp.
Come on, come on, will you? I'm in a hurry.
Sure thing. I tell father.
My father say hurry is waste.
Waste is cracked bowl, which never know rice.
I don't care how cracked your father's rice bowl is.
What I want...
Hey. Some of you people get over here right away.
Okay, you're on your way.
Hooray. Hooray.
I'm getting out of here.
Not full. Can't go yet.
Oh, just you watch me.
As we come to the midway point in the first day's racing,
Peter Thorndyke, after a delay at Chinese Camp, is beginning to catch up with the rest of the field.
That knocked him off the
Christmas tree, sir.
This is our kind of terrain from here on out, all downhill.
How true it is that the best ways are the simplest ways after all.
That's what I always say, sir.
Oh, shut up.
We should be coming soon to what is either a rail tunnel or a bridge.
Oh, here's a tunnel.
That must be it.
What are you doing?
It's an elevator.
But Herbie doesn't fit.
Everybody out.
No sign of them.
You may open the wine now, Havershaw.
It's chilled the way you like it, sir.
All right, give me a hand.
Altogether now.
To you, sir. My unbounded admiration.
Thank you.
You know something about champagne, sir?
Havershaw, if you tell me that the bubbles tickle your nose,
I shall probably kill you.
Eek.
Get rid of that slop.
Shouldn't that wheel have come off by now?
It's long overdue, sir.
I'm terribly embarrassed by the delay. I don't know what...
Stop whimpering.
I'll just give them a friendly nudge.
Hey, where'd that wheel come from?
Hold it.
All right, don't do anything sudden.
Is it all right if I just cry real soft?
Carole, put your feet back here on the bumper.
Now give me your hand.
Let go, let go. Give me your hand.
I'm trying, but my mind don't get the message.
Come on, come on.
Now come right over the top.
Atta-boy.
All right, let's get the spare wheel on and get Herbie back on the road.
Thorndyke again.
He made a pizza out of it.
And now, here in Virginia City, the terminal point for the first day of the El Dorado, we're all looking down the road from the west.
And, actually, at any moment now, we should be seeing the car that will complete the first half of the El Dorado, the run for the gold.
Up in the judges' stand, the judges and the timers are ready.
Just a moment.
The first car is coming in sight right now.
He is really flying down the road.
And there he goes by us.
You making it all right, Tennessee?
Waah.
Whoa.
Stop, Jim, will you?
Waah.
Now, don't anybody breathe.
Ready?
Actually, at this hour, only one car is unaccounted for.
There's been absolutely no word of the Douglas special, which figured so very prominently in the early stages of the race today.
Well, I see the judges are closing down for the night, and, by golly, so are we, but we'll return to the El
Dorado at 7:30 tomorrow morning to bring you the start of the second and the final lap back to Yosemite Valley.
Good night, everyone.
A little bird's nest soup never hurt anyone.
Thanks.
Oh, thanks.
I hope this holds together. I'm putting welds on top of welds.
Mr. Wu, the wiring is mostly all burned off.
The cylinder walls are scored.
The carburettor is a mess.
The body's sprung.
This little car ripped itself to pieces trying to get us here.
It gave us everything it's got.
Now, maybe we could patch it back together,
I don't know, but...
How can I send it back into that rat race tomorrow?
It's got nothing left to give.
It's your car.
What do you say?
A wise man once said...
"When you come to last page,
"close the book."
You let that little car get under your skin, didn't you?
I don't know.
There's a lot of gloop been written about it.
The bond between a man and his automobile and how he hates it sometimes, mostly, how he loves it.
Showers gifts on it in the way of accessories and all that.
He gets hysterical if somebody scratches the paint or makes it lose face on the freeway.
Maybe some of those feelings got into the machinery, I don't know.
Tennessee thinks so.
Don't you?
There is something real about that little car, something that doesn't even have a name.
What I don't understand is, out of the millions of people in the world, why it picked a dog-eared second-rater like me.
You stood up for it once.
I guess it thought you were worth belonging to.
I understand that.
Ah, Douglas.
Didn't mean to disturb you.
We'll just take the car and go.
Take the car? What are you talking about?
I understand that you are out of the race.
What does that have to do with you?
Speaking as the new owner of the car, I regard your question as impertinent.
I'm going to hoist it up and drag it out.
Hold it.
Who said you were the new owner of the car?
Perhaps Mr. Wu would like to explain how he wagered the car on the outcome of the race.
Even as you, I believed in the little car.
I thought it would win.
More honestly, I could not resist the odds.
Thank you.
Good sir, would you say that this is a compact car?
You do not answer.
Well, let me tell you that you have never seen a compact car until you see what I'm going to do with this.
Mr. Douglas, I have a friend with a claw and hook auto wrecking company in San Francisco, and he's going to work on your car.
Maybe he'll transform it into a birdbath.
Or what about a nice doormat so I can wipe my feet on it every day?
Well, it's too bad this thing doesn't have the gumption to get up to the starting line this morning.
I should've enjoyed beating it.
Oh.
Why, you...
Take your hand...
Get your hands off.
Ooh.
Stop. Herbie, stop.
Hey, you know something?
Small car very angry.
And very strong.
The strength of 40 horses.
What do you think about that race coming up?
You know... I think now is chance to remove egg fu Yung off face.
Well, this morning, the second and the final lap of the El Dorado, from Virginia City to Yosemite, the run for the gold.
Out there, we see in first position and all ready to go,
Peter Thorndyke in his
Thorndyke special.
Don't worry... Hey.
Whoa.
These mechanics have done a real fine job in keying these engines up.
Come on, baby.
Come on, save it for the race.
One more foul-up like this,
Douglas, you're disqualified.
It seemed to be trying to get at us, sir.
Of course it was, Havershaw.
It's no use trying to blink the fact.
It's either us or it this time.
We're now getting reports from our checkpoint number 14, and this one tells us that the Thorndyke car is still holding first position at this time.
And while here in Virginia City, we're preparing to dispatch the last of our contestants.
That would be the Jim
Douglas special.
Hang tight. This may be a fast take-off.
Now.
Good stuff, Herb.
No more shortcuts like that last one, Jim.
Oh, this won't be anything like that last one.
Thorndyke.
Nice going, Herbie.
We've almost got him.
Hooray.
What fool laid out these streets?
But you're driving superbly.
Hey. You got something against driving on the streets?
Any sign of them?
Not a glimmer, sir.
Very well, then.
Now I've finished being generous George.
He's moving up.
There are times like this when I really don't like myself very much.
What happened to it?
I'd say it's gone for that last big lube job up yonder.
Ow. Ow.
Whoa.
Here it comes again, sir.
Havershaw, I am not a cowardly man, but I am beginning to sense that that thing is out to get me.
Now, none of that, sir.
We're not losing our nerve, are we?
Blast you, Havershaw. How dare you patronise me.
I am not losing my nerve.
No, sir. No, sir. Of course not, sir. No, no.
I think Herbie did something to himself that last fall.
What do you mean?
Well...
Like maybe he won't hang together much longer.
Yeow.
What happened to Thorndyke?
I don't know. It was like he disappeared.
Do you hear something?
Sounds like one of the cylinders.
That's impossible. The cylinders are in the back.
That's a point I find puzzling.
Get me out of here.
- Oh, my goodness.
- Get that side.
Oh. Ooh.
Here. Turn him around.
Okay, on your way.
Let's go.
Havershaw.
The leaders have now passed the final checkpoint.
We're now moving outside and we should be seeing them at the finish line in a very few minutes.
The word is the Douglas car is in the lead, but the Thorndyke car is moving up.
Oh. I think we got a problem.
Carole, turn around.
Grab hold of that strap and pull.
Ooh.
You okay?
Fine.
Look. There's another one.
I got it.
What goes on?
Just keep driving.
Try not to think about what I'm doing.
Well, that's that.
Yaah.
I can't weld that.
Give me your hand.
What are we gonna do, jump?
- No, pull.
- Why?
Whoa.
Whoa. Jim, help.
I think you better stop before someone gets hurt.
No dice. Herbie doesn't want to stop.
There it is.
I'll bomb the thing off the road once and for all.
Rotten sportsmanship, if you ask me.
Here at the finish, we're still waiting for our first glimpse of the leaders.
Yes. Yes, there they are.
The Thorndyke car now seems to have a slight edge on the Douglas car, which is hanging right in there.
You have him now, sir. Don't falter.
I'm not going to falter, you dimwit.
Good-o, sir, good-o.
You can't lose.
You can't possibly lo...
- We won. We won.
- Ha, ha, ha.
The little car takes first...
And third place.
Whoa.
Come on. Give us a picture.
Beautiful. One more.
What? Kiss? You better believe that.
- Oh.
- Come here.
"Couldn't lose," I think you said.
I don't like to remind you, sir, but if only you'd read the terms of that stupid wager you made with Mr. Wu.
Havershaw, you're despicable.
Havershaw, I shan't pretend I don't know what you're thinking.
However, I pride myself on being a good judge of character, and when I ask myself,
"Could this man be capable
"of such an act of pettiness and base...
"Base ingratitude." I accept that as your answer.
Ha, ha...
Thanks, Herbie. So long, Mr. Wu.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye, Mr. Wu.
- Bye, Tennessee.
- So long, Jim.
It's none of my business, but where are you going on your honeymoon?
We don't know. Herb hasn't told us yet.
Let's go, Herb.
Goodbye, Herbie.
Two thousand years ago and more,
Julius Caesar came, saw and... conquered the land of the Gauls after a long and bitter struggle.
The resistance was led by Vercingetorige.
This valiant young leader... was forced to lay down his arms at the feet of Caesar. lt's an historical fact that Caesar had a lot of Gaul but he didn't have it all.
One little region held out.
A fortified village surrounded by the... entrenched Romans and it is in this village that we shall meet the hero... of our tale, the mighty warrior Asterix.
There he is now, about to go hunting for wild boar, their habit.
You'll be back soon Asterix ?
- Yes l'll be back in time for dinner.
Ah something tells me there are
Romans around here.
What hit me ?
- The Gaul keeper's key.
The occupation of Gaul as we see was no Roman holiday.
And one sweet morning the legion leader , Bonus Belonus, was meditating.
Hail Bonus Belonus !
The patrol is back.
Hail Patroleum, lets hear the report !
- Hail Bonus Belonus.
By Jupiter, how did you men get so badly beaten, were you outnumbered ?
Well, were we outnumbered ?
- Outnumbered ? l wouldn't say that.
There was a boy.
And he wasn't too big either.
By Jupiter there is a deep secret to the Gaelic strength.
Well Asterix, anything special happened ?
- Oh no, oh yes, l crowned four Romans.
That all ?
- Obelix, how would you like some boar ?
Oh sure, just got a couple of these to drop off.
Yum yum roast boars. l guess the Romans were furious.
They are going to attack us again you'll see.
Why worry as long as Panoramix can cook up his magic potion.
That reminds me this is my ration day, let's go see the old Druid.
Come along Obelix ?
- You know we mustn't waste food.
Hear that ! That's him cutting mistletoe with his golden sickle.
Panoramix, Druid ?
What's the matter Panoramix ?
- You scared me, you made me... cut my finger with my sickle.
- Sorry,l've come to get my potion.
Shhh, it's a secret, come with me !
With stirring motion l mix the potion that gives us our magic powers.
The magic potion that increases your strength a thousand fold.
Exactly what do you put into that potion, oh druid ?
The origin of the potion is lost in the darkness of the ages.
A Druid can only repeat the secret to another druid, all that l can tell you... is that it contains mistletoe and lobster, the lobster is not necessary... but it tastes good.
Can l have some too ?
- No Obelix, no no you know you can't !
You fell into the potion when you were just a baby and the effects... of the potion on you are permanent, you know that.
Why don't you try out the effects of the potion for us ?
Sure here l go. lt works, old druid it works.
Those poor poor Romans, how sorry l feel for them.
And now lets see what the Romans are up to.
And in spite of our siege, these Gauls go on defying us ! lf they are going to fight one against four it isn't fair !
We have to find out their secret .
- You're right Marcus Sufrus. l must have a volunteer, who will go and spy on the Gauls ?
With so many volunteers l 'll decide by playing musical chairs.
This game which has come to us down through the ages. lt was played with one chair less than there were legionnaires ... when the music stopped... lt's Caligolaminus ! lt's Caligolaminus ! lt's Caligolaminus !
No no l won't go
- Caesar will reward you Caligolaminus.
No not me !
Either you volunteer or l will feed you to the lions. lf you insist, l'll go.
- Make a Gaul out of Caligolaminus.
Meanwhile in the Gaelic village...
Men it's a long time now since we last heard from the Romans, that's a bad sign.
We must be vigilant and remember to get your ration of the potion.
Hooray for Tunabrix, our chief !
Hooray for Tunabrix, our chief !
Chief ! Chief !
- Yes Obelix ?
Panoramix won't give me any potion, that's not fair. Because l feel weak.
You weak ?
- Oh my oh my, here comes Stopthemusic ! l shall now sing a lay in honour of Gaelic courage !
Barbarians, they can't appreciate my art.
Caligolaminus is now ready !
- Good, lets go and see.
Put him in chains.
You're going for a stroll near the village of the Gauls, when the Gauls see you ... they'll rescue you, when you'll be within their gates, you'll learn their secret.
Now how do you like my plan ?
- Well just between us l don't understand.
Take him to the enemy.
- Take it easy, easy man easy ! l'm a real Roman, l'm a Roman, hey ! l'd like to get into a good fight.
- Yeah but don't count on it Asterix.
The Romans are staying close to their camp, they're tired of getting beat.
What's that ?
The sound of chains
Somebody's arriving, up the tree.
How long are we going to have to walk like this.
Shut up, you'll be the only one spared when the Gauls attack, don't forget !
Romans coming, they've got a Gaul.
- Let's save him ! l feel better.
Let's we wake them up and start again.
No come on, it's getting late.
- Come along little fellow.
Mission accomplished.
Well lets take off his chains.
- But you can't do it without tools.
Tools ? Who needs tools ?
Well who are you ?
- l'm Cali... Caligoliminix. l live in Lutetia.
But the Romans and Gauls live in peace there, don't they ?
Well in their eyes l appear so foxy, that they think l am a spy.
The Romans take you for a spy ?
Are they stupid ?
The heroic patrol, commanded by
Marcus Sufrus returns to the camp.
At HamsweetHam.
Oh hail, the Gauls came they saw and they freed Caligolaminus.
What a great victory for us ! l hope that Caligolaminus will come back to us in a single piece. l hope so for him otherwise l'll grind his pieces to pieces.
And throw him to the lions.
Poor Caligolaminus.
We're approaching the village, there you'll be safe. There's only us Gauls.
Oh great !
Asterix and Obelix they brought company !
- l wonder who it is.
You'll have to meet our chief, the great Tunabrix.
Where are the Romans ? Let me at them !
Where are the Romans ?
Here we are ! l bid you welcome brother and l hope you'll feel at home.
Well, thanks.
And now l shall carol a song of welcome.
Stroll around the village till supper.
- All right. l'll find out what sort of tools these Gauls use to work their metal.
Hey come on Obelix , that stone !
- Here it is, coming right up.
Gosh They really are strong !
There must be a secret to this power.
Hey Caligoliminix ! Supper's ready !
Roast boar.
- Roast boar ? ls there a secret to your super human strength ?
Yup, but we can't tell it.
Why don't you eat ? lt'll get cold otherwise.
Why can't you tell me what the secret is ?
- Because it's a secret. lt's not fair ! lf we Gauls can't share our secrets, what's the use ? lf l was as strong as you l could get past the Roman line and get back to my home.
What do you say ?
- Well l say lets finish his roast boar.
My relatives are probably worried.
- Well lets go and see the Druid.
Panoramix ! Panoramix !
What do you want now Asterix ?
Me, nothing, but our new friend want to know why we're so strong. lts absolutely out of the question.
But l have to get home to get back to work.
What do you work at ? l'm a guide, l guide for Lutetia by night. National tourism.
No ! No ! And No !
All right, l get it, you don't want me. l'll get to Lutetia anyway and if the Romans throw me to the lions... at each bite l'll say,
''You can blame Panoramix the Druid !
You can blame Panoramix the Druid !
You can blame Panoramix the Druid !
Oh Well, all right !
- Come back Caligoliminix !
Come back, Caligoliminix ! l'll show you the secret of our power, l'll even give you a portion of a potion. lt's a secret you can drink ?
- Go call the others Asterix. lt's a secret you can drink ?
- Go call the others Asterix.
Get your magic potion !
Come and get your potion !
Come and get your potion !
Magic ?
- Potion ?
Come and get your potion !
- Magic ?
Potion ?
- The magic potion ?
A portion of this potion, can give you the necessary strength to return... to Lutetia but the effects of it disappear quickly. lt tastes like vegetable soup.
- l can make it taste like other things... lamb barbecue, clam chowder, cheese omelette, steak and onions...
But l don't feel anything special.
- Why don't you try lifting up that rock ?
But l will never be able to.
Hey little fellow, you have to be careful anyway.
What are we going to do now ?
- Were going to dance.
Lets the dance now begin !
Take your places !
Step to the right !
Step to the left !
Left row forward, right row back !
Mark your places, reach your partner.
Pull your partners moustache !
Pull your partners moustache !
These are removable moustaches,
They are the latest style in Lutetia.
Your are no Gaul, you're a Roman spy.
Get the Roman ! lt's no use Asterix, remember he just drank the potion. lt's because of you that he escapes.
By my golden sickle, you are the one who insisted that l give him some.
Lets forget it, he didn't learn much and the effect will disappear soon.
Hail Bonus Belonus ! l've learnt the secret of the Gauls. lt's a magic potion.
Where is this potion ?
- Here here here !
Come along Caligolaminus, l want to see what effects this potion produces.
Fight them !
Fight them ! l said fight them !
- Him ? Fight us ? By Jupiter, he can't !
We'll make mincemeat out of them.
That's that !
Wonderful ! Trouble is we don't have the potion to study ! l suggest we cut him open just like a rabbit.
You just try it, come on you just try it.
Your idea isn't bad, but
Caligolaminus refused to cooperate.
Sure l refuse !
How long is the potion effective ?
How long ? l don't know.
All right, lift that rock.
There you are.
What a man ! Now don't move, when that rock gets too heavy for you ... it'll mean the effects of the potion have completely disappeared.
Much much later...
Well now, you don't feel quite so strong ?
- No not quite. lf l can find out what's in that potion, l can become emperor, Bonus Caesar.
We leave Bonus Belonus to his dreams and return to the Gauls. l'm going to gather mistletoe.
- Do you want me to come along ?
No Asterix, you stay here and protect the village, your strength is ... due to my potion but your intelligence was yours from the day you were born.
Anyhow l won't be very long.
All right.
You Roman nincompoops !
We've captured the Druid, Bonus Belonus.
- Bravo, Julius Octopus, as a reward... you can have a pass to go to Rome and see the circus.
Rome, l'm going to the circus !
Rome, l'm going to the circus !
Druid tell me your secret.
- The secret ? Not on your life.
This man must talk, get me the torturer.
We'll see if he'll talk or not.
Cough !
Come on druid ! We've been torturing you for hours and it hasn't helped. lt has helped me pass the time.
- Speak, l'll make you powerful and rich !
No !
You will have lots and lots of money.
No
The magical powers of this Druid are much too strong for me.
And he's so stubborn, a stubborn as a mule.
What's the matter Asterix ?
You look worried.
The Druid went to gather mistletoe and he hasn't come back. l'm going to go and find him.
- Be careful Asterix !
You had your potion a long time ago.
- Well l'll just have to trust my brain.
Panoramix !
Druid, where are you ?
Panoramix !
Panoramix !
Panoramix !
Don't worry, don't sell your oxen.
- Then what ?
Just sell your cart .
- What ?
Just sell your cart and go home with your oxen.
What a brilliant idea that is !
Stop, stop enough !
Tell me, have you seen a Druid gathering mistletoe ?
No but l did see one being carried in a net, a group of legionnaires.
They were taking him to HamSweetham.
What ? You take me to Hamsweetham.
- But that is a way out of my way !
Hamsweetham is the biggest market around and it has a great used cart park.
How lucky for me to have met you,
Hamsweetham, here we come.
Why are you hiding ?
- To play a joke on my Roman pals.
That's great, l love jokes.
This jackass should get the laurel wreath for stupidity.
What are you carrying in your cart ?
- Nothing.
By Jupiter, are you laughing at me ?
What is going on here Cracsus Daris ?
This sap is laughing at me, l'll have to check his cart.
Let him enter, l know him he's not dangerous.
That idiot had almost got me caught.
Here we are in camp, are you going to play your joke now ? lt's dark, ln the morning it'll be funnier.
- Oh sure.
Goodnight... l better start looking for the
Druid, lets start there.
Lie down and dine, oh Marcus, my loyal right-hand. We must talk.
Thank you Oh gracious Bonus.
We must get the secret recipe the
Druid has for the potion, understand ?
And when we do we shall march on Rome and take the place of Caesar.
Julius Caesar ?
Right friend, Jules, and the two of us will form a powerful triumvirate. l have need of him now but later in Rome, l'll be the triumphant. l'll have him eaten by a lion in Rome, l shall become Caesar, just me, all alone.
This is very interesting but it doesn't help me find Panoramix the Druid.
Oh he's certainly being guarded in that tent. l beg your pardon, l've come to free Panoramix, my friend.
Don't let him get out, he's an unconquerable Gaul. l'll go get some help.
- Sure go.
Asterix !
- How are you ?
Have you gone mad ? Why did you come here you've walked into the lions den.
Chief ! Chief !
These asses can't do a thing against my magical powers. l know that, lets have some fun, with them, l 've got a few ideas.
Chief ! Chief !
Oh Bonus Belonus
- What now ?
We've captured a Gal, G, Gaul in the t, tent of the D, D Druid.
We need reinforcements or the prisoner is sure to get away.
By the great Jupiter, sound off the alarm !
Surrender, you Gauls, if not l'll order my brave legionaries to attack you. l hope he surrenders.
The suspense is killing me. l toss my weapon at your feet as
Vercingetorige, my chief, tossed his ... at Caesar's feet, come on, l'm surrendering. l've got no time to waste !
Seize that Gaul or l'll have you all fed to the lions.
Lions ?
- Fed to the lions he said !
- And he means it too.
Hey what's happening ?
The camps been invaded by a Gaul.
- Well that's not fair, he might have waited will l woke up to begin his joke.
He doesn't play fair, it's not nice !
So you refuse to speak, do you Druid ?
But tomorrow on the torture rack ... your friend may be a bit more gracious !
They've no idea how loquacious l'll be. l'll break the record for loquacit
Shh they're coming !
Bonus Belonus wants to see you.
You, do you know the secret of the magic potion ?
Me ? No !
- For the last time Druid... give me the recipe for the magic potion or l'll have your friend tortured.
You can't scare me Roman.
- l trust in the courage of my friend.
Well, we shall see, l want this Gaul tied to that table, and go get the torturer.
Here l am, you know my motto, always ready.
Pity please, don't hurt me, l can't take anymore !
Enough, l can't see him suffer like this, l'll tell you all.
Torturer, desist !
But chief l didn't even get started.
Oh pity please, pity please !
OK druid, let me in on the secret, if not l'll have him finish the job. l'll prepare the potion in front of you but l need a number of ingredients... that l can only find in the forest.
- What scared-i cats these Gauls are !
You will have what you need, go with him l will hold the other Gaul as a hostage. l'll need mistletoe... herbs and a few roots, and some flowers.
The Druid is back.
- Now he wants a big pot.
Then give him one !
Just a pinch of salt, a tiny touch of pepper and let it bubble.
Bubble ? Bubble oh make it bubble fast.
- Something is lacking.
An ingredient that is important,
- What ? What ? What ?
Strawberries.
- Strawberries at this season ?
Of course it won't be that easy, we could wait until the right season.
No, send out our fastest messengers, l want strawberries, strawberries !
Strawberries, strawberries !
Asterix, you get good ideas.
- You are the one who thought of ... sending them strawberry picking, while we lounge at Caesar's expense.
The messengers have been gone for days, not a single one has returned.
The messengers have come back !
- That's fine.
Hail Bonus Belonus.
- Hail my legionaries, did you find them ?
No, no sir !
- No strawberries Bonus.
- And we lost Julius Octopus.
Here l am Bonus Belonus, look l found the strawberry, l ran into a route... merchant just back from Greece, l had to pay their weight in gold !
That's good, you shall have a reward, l grant you a pass to Rome and you've... my permission to go to the circus.
- l'm going to the circus !
Druid, here are the strawberries you needed for your magic potion.
What do you think of them Asterix ?
- l'm not sure they are of fine quality.
Could be worse. l've changed my opinion they are excellent.
Yes, just what l needed for my potion, send for another basket. l've had about enough, you're driving me mad, you're not being fair.
All right, all right, take it easy, don't cry l'll prepare your potion.
Stop crying, he'll prepare it.
- Sure, l'll make it without strawberries.
Of course it won't be as sweet.
- Anyhow strawberries ... can give you a rash. lt's ready, it's best to serve it hot.
- l'll be first.
Where is the proof that your potion is not a poison, by Jupiter ? l'll be happy to taste it first if you are afraid.
No, if this potion is the real one it will increase your power ... and you will become invincible. l want a volunteer ! l said l am calling for a volunteer.
Oh Bonus Belonus, don't risk the life of a legionnaire, try the potion ... on some ordinary person for the experiment.
Good idea !
You come over here, friend.
- Who me ?
Are you well, my good friend ?
- No l am not, l was told l could sell ... my cart but no one wants to buy it, and it is all his fault ! l don't quite get what you mean but for consolation you may have some of this.
No thanks, l don't drink.
Drink it !
Why are you looking at me ? Didn't you ever see a cart dealer taking a drink ?
After drinking this potion, you are the worlds strongest man.
Me ?
You're so funny, he's a big joker.
We'll find that out, punch somebody !
- But l'm not mad at anybody.
A volunteer for a good wallop ! l would like a bit more enthusiasm when l call for a volunteer.
Me, l'll volunteer.
- You, that's an idea By Jupiter.
Go on !
- Go ahead hit him !
Go on, hit him !
- Hit him, you fool !
By Jupiter, its absolutely marvellous.
Did it hurt much ?
- l thought the sky dropped on my head.
Well you don't need me anymore so, l guess l'll go.
That potion is simply, that is its magic.
Forward, come and get your magic potion.
The road to Rome lies before us, oh Marcus, Caesar's days are numbered.
You Druid, you write down the recipe of the magic potion.
They will be cooked once it is in our possession, that will teach them a lesson.
A good idea yes.
Let us tryout our great new strength. l'm trying to over do it. l'll try that boulder.
A smaller one. l'm strong, l am a superman !
What great power !
- Yes ?
Bonus Belonus ?
- Yes ?
There is no powers in lifting that little stone.
You're right !
So you tricked me you Gauls, this potion is not magic.
Yes it is !
Oh Bonus Belonus, lets settle the hash of these Gauls.
How dare you appear before me without shaving ?
A good legionnaire should be clean shaven !
You are right but a legionnaire leader should set an example.
But, what, what is gong on ?
- Look at them !
What's happening here Druid ?
- lt's an old formulae for a hair growing... lotion, an extremely powerful one, the hair on you heads and on your face... will grow and grow with the fastest pace. l will have you killed.
Give me the anti-dote for this. lf you kill us who will make the antidote for you ? We are a little bit tired today.
- Yes, we are going to retire to our tent.
Hey you two ! Wait, hey !
What's wrong oh Bonus Belonus ? l caught my foot in my beard, imbecile ! l am at the mercy of these Gauls, l'll have to bargain with them.
Three thousand and seventy five.
- What ? lt's a new game we invented, one who sees a beard gets 15 points, 10 000 wins.
You've got your goal, you Gaul, well what do you want ?
Promise not to split hairs about it ?
- Don't you mention hairs again, you hear ?
That's for the beards.
- No wait, please.
All right but don't get in my hair again.
Oh to be exact to a hair we'll listen !
All right, l give up, just give me the antidote and l'll let you go free.
Well you see l don't feel very much feel like working now.
He gets a hand for being hair brained.
You wouldn't think he's just had a close shave.
All right, all right don't get so upset, l'll do it. l'll have to go out again and... get all the ingredients in the forest.
Yes but with an escort.
Why did you accept so fast, he's up to no good.
The effects of the potion l laid down aren't going to last very long.
Tomorrow there won't be any beards, so we had better try to get out of here.
As soon as l'm rid of this long hair and this beard, l'll murder those Gauls. lt will give me a riotous satisfaction.
We have come to escort you to the forest to gather the ingredients for the potion. l have a plan.
- That's great, we've got a million idea.
You will keep off my beard.
Keep your beard off from under my feet.
Come on hurry, our beards keep growing. l think that now l have got pretty much what is necessary. lt's only us.
- That's fine, well get to work. l've been working all morning, l hope l will be able to take a rest sometime.
Where are you going ?
- Can l see him prepare the anti -dote ?
No, better not, you would hinder us, you are too nervous.
You guards, watch this tent, see to it they don't escape.
Well that's good, you see Asterix, in the small pot l have prepared ... our real magic potion, l think we will need your muscles if we are to get out ... of here and here in the big pot l have prepared the anti dote. water, salt, vegetables and a marrow bone, since we have to taste it in front... of the Romans l thought you would like something good.
The magic potion is ready, might as well take a good portion.
All right now call our bearded hosts.
Hey Romans, soups on !
You bring that pot out here.
- All right, all right.
You taste it first. ls it good ?
- lt's fine but l like it with more salt. lt's your turn Bonus Belonus.
How can we really be sure that this potion keeps the hair from growing longer ?
You really are clever, watch my moustache you will see, it has stopped growing.
By Jupiter, it is true, drink men.
They swim like swine.
- Yes.
Now my guards, seize those two Gauls.
- The pleasure is mine.
Not by the hair of your chinny chin chin.
Let me go, please let me go, help me.
Run, we'll leave while they are picking up the pieces. l was just starting to have some fun.
- Halt you, get back in there.
Romans !
More Romans !
Many more !
More there ! We are surrounded.
Reinforcements, they got here just in time, what luck. lt's not so good.
Now l've got you Gauls, l'll have you eaten by the lions.
Oh Bonus Belonus, you are awaited in your tent, it's urgent.
Urgent ?
- Yes urgent.
Who's cloak is this littering my tent ?
Remnant of Caesar, that which is Caesar.
Julius Caesar ?
- ln person. l have come to find out what you are been doing about he Gauls.
And I want to know what has been going on here to keep your garrison... from receiving me with all due honour.
Well you see, l mean, we have been fighting what l mean is with some Gauls.
Fighting with Gauls ? How many Gauls ?
- Two.
By Cleopatra, show me the two man who are capable of standing up against... a garrison of my legionaries.
Well so there are the terrible Gauls ?
Tell me just what happened here ?
Caesar, Bonus Belonus was trying to steal our magic potion so he... would be invincible. He intended to become emperor.
Well, well
- Oh well, let me explain...
You need not bother, and go and shave will you ? You and your men will be... leaving for Mongolia, there're other barbarians there who tried to oust me.
But l could explain everything.
- And as for you, in exchange for the services you have rendered l shall... allow you your liberty, but we will meet before long, Gauls. l'll count on that Caesar.
By the Gods here they are.
Hooray Panoramix, Hooray Tunabricks our chief hooray Asterix,
Let us rejoice because our brothers have reached a decisive new victory.
Hooray for Tunabricks our chief.
Let the festivities start.
Under a star studded sky, the little fortified village of brave Gauls celebrated one more victory. Obtained through the protection of their Gods. lntelligence, magic and courage, they knew the future would bring them ... further victories over the Roman legions.

[ Katie ]
Just fine.
And you look gorgeous.
Now please, try to remain clean.
How about this one?
[ Alice ]
Do you like it better than the green one?
Oh, yes, dear!
It's just fine.
I always did love that dress.
I didn't see nothin' wrong with the white one you had on in the first place.
Oh, grandpa, do you really like that one better than this one?
I mean, do you think it looks better on me?
Honey, you'll have 'im bug-eyed and breathless no matter what dress you're wearin'.
I just didn't want to see her get her heart broke.

He sure thinks he is somebody.
Got a big, gold watch chain.

I hope you had a nice trip.
Yes, quite nice.
I-I don't... I don't think
I would have recognized you...
If we'd met on the street.
It's probably your moustache.
It...
Well, it-it makes you look so different.
Oh?
Um, would you have recognized me?
Well, I, uh...
I don't quite recall...
Well, from my picture, I mean.
Oh.

Well, I-i know it wasn't too good of me.

And I-i guess I don't have the best memory in the world.

My wife tells me what I should do...
Your wife?
Look, am I in the wrong house or something? I wanted to see a "rensselaer bower."
Now they told me...
Rensselaer?
Well, that's my grandfather.
[ Sighs ]
You mean you're not Joseph carder?
[ Laughs ]
I'm Henry white...
Of the Democratic national committee.
Oh! [ Laughs ]
Mr. bower has corresponded with postmaster Dickinson.
Something about a campaign song he's written...
And a family band he'd like to take to the convention in St. Louis.
Strange.
Grandpa? Grandpa, this man is here to see you.
[ Scoffs ]
He's from the Democratic national committee!
That must mean they're interested.
We're just as good as on the train to St. Louis.
[ Children cheering ]
It's sure nice of ya to come.
Mighty glad to see ya.
I promised postmaster Dickinson.
Well, eh, what I had in mind was the reason I writ down.
You see, I made up a campaign song for president Cleveland.
I know.
And what I thought might be a good idea...
To take the family band to St. Louis...
And sort of introduce it right there at the convention.
Put on a whole musical show if ya want.
I read the letter.
Well, first thing, of course, before ya decide, maybe you'd like to hear the song?
We do feel that a good, stirring song might inspire party workers...
To greater effort and devotion.
You sure come to the right place!
Been a lot of dirty, underhanded politics.
Republicans making a play for the undecided voters, the fence straddlers.
Trying to tell them grover
Cleveland hasn't lived up to his campaign promises.
Shh. My daughter-in-law, Katie, don't like politic talking in the house.

We're gonna play our campaign song!

Oh, how do you do?
You must be Mr. carder.
Yes. Mrs. bower? Joe carder.
We were just having a little celebration.
Would you excuse me, please?
Oh, of course. It's...
No! Go away!
Alice, it's me,
Joe carder!
Just leave me alone!
Go away!
Please!
[ Screams ]
Whoa!
Alice.
I can't imagine what you must think.
Then I'll tell you what I think.
I think you must be a lot more fun than I ever realized, than I even dared to hope!
The way you were doing that, you were...
What I mean is,
I've never seen anyone clown around like that...
And look beautiful all at the same time.
You want to know something?
I-I haven't slept in a week.
J-just thinking about what
I would do, w-what I would say when we first met.
I was afraid it would all be so formal like your letters.
And I-i wouldn't know what to say, I would j-just... i wouldn't think of anything.
Or maybe I'd...
And I would just start jabbering and not have enough sense to stop.
That's silly.
Why would anybody feel like that?
[ Giggles ]
Actually, I was the one who found the name of your newspaper.
I asked Alice to send that first letter.
[ Giggles ]
Well, I must not have done a very good job, selling you on Dakota.
Well, uh, it isn't always that simple.
You see, a family the size of ours, we put down a lot of roots.
But if you could just realize the opportunities there are in Southern Dakota.
We're about to become a state, you know?
Must be beautiful in the black hills: Trees, lakes, little streams.
Oh, I'm sure it's very nice, but we have a good life here...
And a lot of wonderful friends.
Yep, guess I'll have to go along with that, but...
I always keep thinking there might be someplace out west just a little bit better.
We've been lucky every time we've moved, and a man hates to quit when he's winning.
No place ever gonna be so wonderful that you couldn't dream up something better.
But you wouldn't say that,
Mrs. bower, if you'd just seen the black hills.
The air has a snap to it!
It's the scent of the pines.
And the sky's so blue...
You almost can't believe it.
I know what would be fun!
Why don't you and papa come along to the meeting?
Hear his lecture.
Oh, and, um, grandpa, you can come too, if you'd like.
[ Katie ]
Uh, well, I-i don't really know.
I'd be very flattered if you would come.
Have you gotten many people to move to Dakota?
Well, not just people,
Mr. bower, but the right people.
You see, the thing that first interested our state chairman, he found that you're...
Almost 100 percent republican through this whole area.
Oh? That's mostly what you're interested in, ain't it?
Gettin' Republicans to move up there?
That's right, sir. You see,
Mr. bower, this past year we've had almost a tidal wave...
Of shiftless, irresponsible democrats moving in.
A bunch of shysters and quacks and usury-type moneylenders.
And if we don't do something about it soon, they'll have us outnumbered!
Well, let me tell you somethin', young man. You're trumpetin' a flat tune on a worn-out horn.
'Cause you can't turn back a tidal wave, not by puttin' out a rabble-rousin', ragtag newspaper.
And not by speech-makin' to a bunch of poor, misguided
Republicans! And furthermore...
That's enough, grandpa.
Now stop it.
We have a very special little rule that I have to invoke,
Mr. carder, to, to make life bearable around here.
We do not discuss, we do not even mention politics in this house.
And the summer kitchen,
I consider part of the house.
I'm sorry, Mrs. bower,
I didn't know.
Oh, it's all right.
Oh, it's all right.
I don't blame you.
And I certainly didn't mean to offend you, Mr. bower.
- I just naturally assumed that you were republican too.
- [ Scoffs ]
Alice never happened to mention anything to the contrary in any of her letters.
Well, now that's all settled.
We'd be very happy to attend your meeting, Mr. carder, if you really want us there.
Come, Alice. Let's give
Mr. carder a nice piece of chocolate cake.
And another consideration.
There's enough land in Dakota so that each of your sons, as he comes of age, can take up a homestead, start out in life owning a good piece of land, instead of working all his life trying to get it, trying to pay off a mortgage.
Now, let me tell you something, truthfully.
You're the kind of people we need in Dakota.
Solid, decent, hard-working people, who will help to build, who'll always belong.
Who'll share in the golden future of a glorious land!
[ Crowd murmuring ]
Up in my neck of the woods, in the black hills,
you'll find rivers, lakes and babbling streams.
And that's sweet music, my friends.
Sweet music when you're reading about another drought spreading across the plains.
Now that's why this whole westering movement...
Appeals to thoughtful, far-seeing men, who want a better life for their families.
[ Crowd murmuring ]
[ Man ]
What are we waitin' for?
I'm gonna go home and start packing!
[ Murmuring gets louder ]
Don't forget to take along your snake-bite remedy!
- Do ya have snakes in Dakota?
- No more than most places.
And your frostbite remedy too. Ya might need that even worse!
How cold does it get in the winter?
That depends. We're a very large territory.
Ain't nobody really knows.
Thermometers always freeze up and bust!
[ Laughing ]
[ Crowd murmuring ]
I remind you, all of you, that Mr. carder is here as an invited guest!
And we're gonna listen to him tell us about
Dakota in his own way.
Without interruption!
[ Crowd cheers, applauds ]
I'd be glad to tell you some more about Dakota...

Okay.
Okay, grandpa.
I'll race you back!
Okay!
[ Children laughing ]
[ Katie ]
The first thing we do, we'll make a list of all the things we want to take with us.
Then try and sell off everything else.
[ Calvin ] We can't do it.
Can't do it?
Not this year.
Maybe later on if things work out.
[ Katie ]
But now, Calvin, you know very well that the very best land...
Will go to the first homesteaders that get there.
Yeah, that sounds logical.
And if we wait a whole year, all the good land will be gone.
[ Calvin ]
You've got to remember all the plotting and planning...
And scheming that went into it, to make this St. Louis trip possible.
We can't give it up now.
Well, we're not going to St. Louis...
Just so the children can get a ride on a train.
It's not the children
I'm thinking about.
They've got their whole lives ahead of 'em.
But what about grandpa?
When's he ever gonna get another chance like this?
We're not gonna have him with us forever, you know?
[ Katie ]
Yes, I know.
[ Calvin ] don't you worry.
We'll work it out.
I think we'd be a lot better off, all of us, movin' to rapid city, like your papa wanted to all along.
[ Groaning ]
What fun's a little old mud-street town like rapid city?
And ridin' on a wagon and gettin' a side ache instead of...
I wanna ride on a train!
I want to ride on a train too!
We want to go to St. Louis!
Shh, shh, shh!
Now, will you let me say what I'm gonna say?
I'll talk to Alice.
She'll be disappointed, but she'll understand.
I wish I'd thought ahead a little bit before talking to Sidney...
About him taking up his own homestead, later on.
It might be still possible that we get there next year.
Just suppose we don't get the best...

[ Crowd cheering, applauding ]
Now we met and we surpassed every requirement...
Congress could set forth.
[ Crowd ]
Right!
But do they Grant us statehood?
[ Crowd ]
No.
Do they take us into the union?
[ Crowd ]
No!
Do they live up to their end of the bargain?
[ Crowd ] No!
And why not?
Why not, I ask you?
What's wrong with us?
- Maybe you talk too much!
- [ Crowd jeering ]
Well, then they'd better get used to it...
Right!
'Cause there are a lot of things that need to be said.
[ Crowd agreeing ]
I'll tell you what the trouble really is.
They're afraid of us.
Who's afraid of you?
Because they know that when north and south Dakota become states, and we send our senators back to Washington, we're gonna send Republicans, right?
- [ Booing ]
- Sit down, you silly republican!
Why don't you be quiet, you dumb democrat?
And that just might break the stranglehold...
That grover Cleveland and his
Democratic congress have held upon this great country of ours.
That Joe gets himself wound up, don't he?
Yeah!
[ Laughing ]
[ Joe ] We'll declare ourselves the free and sovereign states of north and south Dakota!
[ Crowd cheering ]
One thing, they got a pretty good crowd out to cheer us across the finish line.
Really, grandpa?
Why do you always have to spoil a good story...
By asking,
"really, grandpa?"
[ Laughing ]
[ Crowd cheering ]
Isn't that Joe carder?
Right? We're free men.
We're free men.
We'll hold our own elections!
[ Crowd agreeing ]
We'll draw up a constitution for the sovereign states of north and south Dakota!
[ Crowd cheering ]
Now, grandpa, you're not gonna get into a political squabble...
Before we even got our feet on the ground.
You know what they're trying to do? They're trying to divide Dakota into two states!
The only reason's so they can send four republican senators back to Washington...
Instead of just the two they're supposed to have!
Now, take it easy.
Hey, Mr. carder!
We made it!
[ Children ]
Hello, Mr. carder!
- Another good republican family come to join us.
- [ Crowd booing, cheering ]
[ Crowd murmuring ]
Oh. Oh.
Why, thank you, sir.
Ah, Ernie stubbins at your service.
Alice.
Oh!
[ Giggles ]
You made it.
Good.
Oh, how are you?
Alice, uh, this is Ernie stubbins, one of our local... yeah.
We already swapped names and done our howdies.
Alice, uh, Mr. wrenn, the president of the school board.
I told Mr. wrenn that you might be interested in a teaching position.
Miss bower, it's a pleasure.
If you'll come this way, my dear,
I'll see that you're signed up.
Oh, well, we just got here...
And I haven't even, uh...
Miss bower, our school is closed for lack of a teacher. We can't afford to waste another day.
Oh, excuse me, Mr. wrenn.
Uh, Mr. and Mrs. Calvin bower.
How do you do?
[ Both ]
How do you do?
Mr. wrenn is president of the school board.
Oh, and their family.
[ Children ]
Hello, Mr. wrenn.
I've located a house for you, Mr. bower.
Good.
It's out on rapid creek.
It's not new, but it's big.
So, I guess you'd better get signed up here in town.
Save a trip back, huh?
This won't take long. Then
I must get word to the children that school opens tomorrow.
[ Children groan ]
Would you wait just a minute,
Mr. wrenn? I'll be right back.
♪ [ Banjo ]
Frank?
Yeah? Yeah?
Carry on for a few minutes, will you please? I'll be right back.
Who, me? All right.
All right, all you children wait here with grandpa.
[ Children ] All right.
But let's just look at the national situation and consider where we're drifting...
If something isn't done to clear up the mess in Washington.
[ Crowd ]
What mess?
What are ya talkin' about?
Let me ask you.
Let me ask you.
What has grover Cleveland ever done to reduce the federal surplus?
[ Crowd ] Yeah!
[ Frank ]
He just goes on...
Collecting his tariff and piling more and more dollars into the treasury.
[ Crowd ]
That's right!
[ Frank ]
Think what it will be like in another 50 or 75 years.
Right. Every dollar in the United States piled up in Washington!
[ Crowd yelling ]
We're gonna have the richest government...
And the poorest people in the history of the world!
[ Crowd agreeing ]
We've got to remember to send men back to Washington...
Who aren't too tightfisted to spend a dollar now and then. Right?

This is all just kind of in fun.
[ Crowd disagreeing ]
Wait a minute!
Wait a minute!
Look, this is a real fine, talented family:
The bowers.
[ Crowd clamoring ]
Now wait!
They've had a long trip.
And, as I've told you before, they're gonna be settling down here.
- Gonna be our neighbors.
- That's a mighty odd sense of humor!
Come to a statehood rally in Dakota and sing about grover Cleveland!
[ Clamoring ]
You own the streets here, do ya?
Keep 'em reserved just for speeches by Republicans?
[ Crowd laughing ]
I kind of thought this was a free country!
[ Crowd agreeing ]
Yeah, that's a good one.
"I thought this was a free country."
That's a good way to put it!
[ Crowd clamoring ]
- All right, grandpa. don't you think you've said enough?
- No, not nearly enough!
I'm gonna find out if we're still in the United States of America, or if we made a wrong turn back there somewhere!
[ Man ] You should have turned.
Now turn around and go back home!
We don't want ya here!
It isn't going to do any harm if they sing a little song about grover Cleveland.
[ Crowd disagreeing ]
Do you think that's all it would take to get him reelected?
[ Crowd ]
No!
Let me tell you somethin'!
Grover Cleveland's gonna be reelected by the biggest landslide in history!
[ Crowd scoffing, cheering ]
Well, that's what makes horse races.
Well, I'll bet ya!
I'll bet ya!
[ Crowd clamoring ]
I'm not a bettin' man.
Aw, come on!
Come on!
Wait a minute.
In the newspaper business, you can't afford to be.
- Wound up, I'll tell ya that.
- All right,
I'll tell ya what I'll do.
I'll give you a free ride down this here street in a wheelbarrow...
If Benjamin Harrison wins.
[ Crowd laughing ]
[ Crowd clamoring ]
That's right.
But now, listen, listen!
But you give me a ride if grover Cleveland wins!
- [ Crowd laughing ]
- You can afford that, can't ya?
[ Crowd ]
Come on, carder!
Come on, Joe!
All right, Mr. bower!
I'll take ya up on that!
[ Crowd cheering ]
Oh, mama,
I feel terrible not helping you with all these things.
It's just so hard to get ready.
Don't worry about me, dear.
I'm getting along just fine.
Grandpa's using your dresser mirror to shave.
[ Children talking ]
I hope we make a lot of friends.
Me too.
You're just starting to put on your hat?
Why don't all of you go on ahead?
Don't worry about me.
I'll be there.
Yes, Alice, dear,
I think that's a very good idea.
Come on, children, now.
Off to school. Come on now.
Good-bye, mama.
Got your lunch?
Got your handkerchief?
Bye, mama.
Good-bye. Oh, Quinn, do stop eating.
Bye, mama.
Good-bye, darling.
Bye.
Good-bye. Now, mind your manners. Bye.
[ Children laughing ]
[ Sighs ]
[ Sighs ]
Say, I'm all done with that mirror now, if you want it.
No, grandpa.
This is all right.
It's fine.
Say, this thing Joe carder's talkin' about yesterday, that they gonna set up their own state government...
If the president and the congress don't do it for 'em.
Grandpa, please, not now.
Now, you best listen 'cause something's being started...
That could hurt a lot of people.
A person, place or thing:
Boy, dog, St. Louis, chair.
Anytime men think they're gonna turn agin the president...
And the congress, take the law into their own hands...
A pronoun replaces a noun:
And set up their own government, he, him, she, it, they, us.
Then there's gonna be trouble.
A verb is a word that denotes action or state of being.
Grandpa, that will do!
Well, I'm just tellin' her for her own good.
Better off if she got somebody else.
Ah, say, that young cowboy that held that horse for ya yesterday.
What's his name again?
Um, Ernie stubbins?
[ Chuckles ]
You remember his name, huh?
[ Laughing ]
Sure is a handsome devil, ain't he?
Well, I don't know.
Yeah. Big he-man type.
You know, I like that.
Um, final inspection.
Oh, just lovely, dear.
Wish me luck, mama.
Oh, you'll be fine, Alice.
Grandpa, I love you.
Thank you.
If I said anything that upset ya,
I didn't mean it.
I just don't want to see ya get in over your head before ya realize it.
[ Knocking ]
Oh.
Oh, I'm glad
I caught you.
Good morning,
Mrs. bower. Mr. bower.
Alice, there's been a little problem come up.
It's a technicality, really, about your credentials.
The school board wants to meet with you and ask a few questions before you start teaching.
Before I start teaching?
Well, that's less than an hour.
[ Joe ]
You'll have to call off school, just for today.
I don't understand.
I thought everything was taken care of yesterday.
They told me that...
By now the children are probably on their way.
Mr. bower, uh, you know where the schoolhouse is, don't you?
Say, this thing you were talking about yesterday...
About how you were going to set up your own state government... grandpa, same rules as before.
There'll be no discussing politics in this house either.
Do you think you could go to the schoolhouse and send the children home?
Tell them there won't be any school today after all.
Do I think...
Thank you, sir.
Ah...
I'll bring her back, Mrs. bower.
And it's nothing to be concerned about, just a technicality.
All right.
Whoa. Whoa.
I just want to show you the place I wrote you about.
Remember?
But I don't think we should if the school board is waiting.
Alice, there are a couple of ladies on that school board...
That wouldn't get to a meeting before
It's the "what"
I'm worried about.
Look, it's nothing, believe me.
Mr. wrenn happened to hear about the ruckus in town yesterday...
When your grandfather sang his grover Cleveland song.
Oh, what's that got to do with me?
I guess he wants to talk to you.
Just to make sure that you're not inclined to stir things up.
Well, that's a very odd thing.
Maybe he wants to make sure it doesn't run in the family.
Oh?
[ Laughs ]
Come on!
[ Laughs ]
Wait.
There.
Oh, it is beautiful.
But let's come back some other time.
Why?
Well, we want to be there when the school board is ready to meet.
[ Stammering ]
Then I have to get back and help mom unpack.
Well, 'cause there are floors to be scrubbed and dishes to be washed...
And-and-and...
I want to plan more for my first day at school.

[ Children cheering ]
[ Children laughing, shouting ]

What's the matter, honey?
You get hurt?

What's your name?
Edna.
What are you crying for, edna, if you haven't been hurt?
I memorized a piece to speak...
And got dressed up...
And I slept all night...
With my hair put up in rags...
And now...
There's gonna be no school.
[ Sniffles ]
[ Chuckles ]
Why don't you speak it for me?
'Cause we ain't in school.
That's what I learned it for.
Well, now, wait a minute.
There ain't no reason why we couldn't have just a little bit of school.
But you said, "go on home."
What I meant...
I didn't mean right now.
I didn't say,
"go home right now."
I never said that.
[ Children laughing, shouting ]
Hey!
Come on back here, all of you!
Where you goin'?
Get back here!
Don't go tryin' to sneak off...
The minute my back is turned!
You told us to go.
You said there wouldn't be any school today.
Yeah!
I was just testin' you, that's all.
You gonna believe anybody that comes along, no matter what they tell you?
[ Grandpa laughing ]
You got a lot to learn, boy.
You better stay around.
[ Ringing ]
[ Ringing continues ]
[ Children chattering ]
[ Chattering continues ]
All right, sit down now.
Come on. Sit down.
Come on, get your seats.
Sit anywhere.
Hey!
Well, now, this here, as most of you know, is the first day of school.
[ Children booing ]
And, for the time bein',
I'm gonna be your teacher.
[ All ]
What?
Now, we're gonna have...
Just a few little things, and then I'll let you go home.
[ Cheering ]
Now, little edna here, she's learned a piece to speak, and she's gonna come right up in the front, and she's gonna speak it.
And you're gonna pay attention.
You don't need to wave good-bye.
We ain't goin' no place.
[ Laughing ]
I wanna ask you something.
What's your name, son?
Johnny dejohn.
- All right.
What you want to ask?
- Are you a regular teacher?
Well, no, my granddaughter Alice, she's gonna be your regular teacher.
I'm just fillin' in for the time bein'.
What I want to know...
Would you set yourself down?
Now, you go ahead, honey.
We're all listenin'.

Do you have a certificate to show you're a regular, qualified teacher?
Well, now,
I'll tell you this, boy.
If I know something you don't know, then I'm qualified to teach you.
Providing, of course, you got sense enough to learn.
[ Children laughing ]
Could I ask, sir, have you ever taught before?
Well, yes, you might say so.
I recollect a time there was about 50 men...
I learned them all to shoot and take care of their rifles.
I was the only teacher they had.
But in school?
That was in the army.
In the civil war!
Right there's the first thing
I'm gonna learn ya!
The proper name is
"the war between the states,"
'cause that's what it was!
[ Johnny ]
You can look in the history books.
They call it the civil war.
What about that?
Yeah!
I don't need to look in no books!
I was there,
Shiloh to appomattox, and you can take my word, there weren't nothin' civil about it!
[ Children laughing ]
That's 'cause you were a ringtail rebel!
Otherwise, you wouldn't object to it being called the civil war!
I done my fighting for the confederacy...
And general Lee, if that's what you mean.
I thought so.
I knew it from the start.
The important thing ain't what you know from the start, it's what you learn goin' along.
We should have learned one lesson from that war:
About our country staying united!
Abraham Lincoln said,
"a house divided against itself cannot stand."
[ Grandpa ]
Folks from Lincoln's own party...
Want to divide up Dakota, the north from the south.
It just don't make sense.
My father says majority rules, and they voted to make it two states.
[ Grandpa chuckling ]
You put your finger on it right there when you says...
They voted on it.
But who's gonna run this state after us old codgers is gone?
It's gonna be you young people, that's who!
But anybody ask you to vote?
[ Children shout ]
No!
[ Grandpa ] No, sir.
They try to tell you
they voted on it!
And you got no say-so!
That's your idea?
Just sit back and let them chop the wagon in two...
When you know it's gonna be you that's got to drive it?
How can we do anything about it if we're not old enough to vote?
[ Children shouting ]
Yeah!
There's always ways to do things once the body puts his mind to it.
I recollect a boy, wasn't much bigger than you are, if at all!

They say a rose that blooms in summertime...
Must die when winter comes, but the memory of its perfume lives...
Like the memory of those drums.
Well, now the war between blue and gray is fadin' in the past, but the courage of that drummer boy...
Is something that will last.
Wasn't that Johnny Shiloh?
Yeah, I guess that's what some called him after...
he was a yankee.
- He didn't fight for the confederacy.
- I never said he did.
But he was an American.
He didn't sit around and say,
"I'm only a little boy.
What can I do?"
I'll tell my pa,
"if I'm old enough to help with the milking,
I'm old enough to have some say about things!"
[ Children cheering ]
And we gotta keep talkin', talkin', talkin' like he kept drummin', drummin', drummin'!
What are you trying to do, Mr. bower?
Get Alice fired before she starts?
Oh, hold on... moving in, taking over a school.
I didn't exactly take over.
I asked you to send the children home, to tell them there wouldn't be any school today.
Now, Joe... the young'uns were already there.
Most of them was all gussied up, bein' the first day of school.
It just seemed a shame to send them home.
I don't think he meant any harm.
Right while you and I were meeting with the school board, giving our word of honor...
That nothing like this would ever happen!
It won't ever happen again.
I figured if Alice knowed enough to teach them for a whole year,
I knowed enough to teach them for one day;
Just part of a day, actually.
But that's just the point!
You didn't teach them!
Joe, please!
You got them cornered in the schoolhouse...
And then you delivered a political oration...
About not dividing Dakota, about making it one state!
It oughta be one state!
If you had a lick of brains, you'd see it for yourself!
Grandpa, that's enough!
I'm sorry, Mrs. bower.
Let's just hope none of the other students go home and start talking.
I wouldn't figure on that!
Joe! Joe.
After this, if it's anything to do with my family, just let me handle it.
[ Sighs ]
Look, it isn't just about your family.
That's a public school.
I know.
I also know that you don't know grandpa the way I do.
To you, he's probably just a cantankerous old man...
That's not the point!
He might be the sweetest man in the whole world!
But if he's gonna take over a public school, inject politics into the classroom, then...
Then it's not just a little thing that you can patch up at home.
I'll say one thing for you.
For a man that goes around preachin' treason agin our
United States government, you sure make a big fuss over a little thing like me teachin' school for a couple hours.
What do you mean
"treason," Mr. bower?
This business you keep talkin' about settin' up your own government, defying the president and the congress that's been elected by the people!
Mr. bower, I don't mind you arguing politics, so long as you don't do it in a schoolhouse.
You're entitled to your own opinion, even if it is completely ridiculous!
But when you go around, start accusing people of treason...
Joe, stop it!
Grandpa, get back in that house!
[ Joe ] I don't care if he is your grandfather, he's not gonna accuse me of treason!
It ain't just my idea.
It's in the Democratic digest!
Grandpa!
The president himself may send troops... be quiet!
I'm asking you as nicely as I know how, please leave.
Alice. Alice.
No!
[ Door slams ]
[ Whinnies ]
Best thing could have happened for Alice, break it off with a man like that.
Cause her nothing but heartache the longer she knowed him.
I... think it's time for the two of us...
To have a little talk.
In here as good a place as any.
Remember the last time
I took you to the woodshed?
When you fought that barros boy and bloodied his nose.
Never forget how you kept a'wigglin' around.
[ Chuckles ]
I had me a big old kindlin' stick, but mostly it kept a'whangin' away in the air, never connectin' with nothin'.
And all the time you was a'howlin' like a banshee.
I'm gonna tell you something.
Most of the time
I was missin' the purpose.
This isn't gonna be easy.
Just don't know how to say it.
"This is gonna hurt me more than it does you," is the customary way to start off.
Least ways, that's how
I always got into it.
You know, I had a hunch you never listened to me.
Pa...
I have tried, all the years that you've been with us, to make you feel welcome... wanted.
And you have been.
There have been times when, well, I've overlooked things that you've done...
More than I would for any other member of the family.
What kind of things?
But I won't have you making trouble for Alice and Joe.
Me cause trouble?
Joe carder's making his own trouble;
More than he realizes.
Thinks just 'cause he runs that little no-account newspaper...
I want you to promise me one thing:
That you will never again argue politics with Joe carder.
Well, now, it weren't just me.
Don't you ever say one word to him about whether Dakota should be one state or two.
Suppose he says something first?
I'm not talking about him,
I'm talking about you.
I'm talkin' about him!
What do you think I'm gonna do?
Just sit like a ninny and not say nothin' if he pops off?
I've said my say.
You've heard me.
That's the way it's gonna have to be.
Now, that's the way it ain't gonna have to be.
I'll tell you that much.
If you think I'm gonna give up my right of free speech...
That men fought and died for...
Just so Joe carder can have everything his own way...
Will you listen to me?
You think I'm gonna sit like a bump on a log...
Whilst maybe my own granddaughter is fixin' to marry some...
Benedict Arnold!
I'll tell you what I think!
If you're gonna remain here as a member of this family, then you better start to exercise a little self-control...
Just the same as everybody else!
You said that.
If'n I'm gonna stay here?
Every time i... hello, grandpa.
Hello, grandpa.
Mine is shinier than yours.
That has a little dent on it though.
[ Children continue chattering ]
Grandpa, what are you doin'?
I know when I ain't wanted.
I don't have to be hit on the head...
With a 10-foot pole.
What are you talking about,
"not wanted"?
I ain't so old or so feeble or so hard up that...
I have to stay with folks that don't want me.
Calvin, what's going on here?
I just made a very reasonable request of grandpa, no more.
Actually, a lot less than
I might make any day of any member of this family.
But i...
Excuse me, Katie.
Grandpa, please don't go.
Grandpa, you can't leave!
[ Crying ]
How can we practice or anything?
[ Children ]
Grandpa, please don't go!
You can't!
Grandpa, please.
Grandpa, please!
Grandpa, please don't go!
Please, grandpa.
Calvin, what did you do to him?
All I did... I asked him not to argue politics with Joe.
Then you better get it straightened out right now, before he gets his neck bowed any more than it is.
It took me a long time, Katie, before I finally got around to saying anything.
I don't believe
I've been unreasonable, and I'm not going to back down.
But...
I guess you know best.
[ Children pleading ]
Grandpa, please don't go!
[ Pleading continues ]
Thanks, Katie, for a lot of things.
I'll be seeing you again sometime.
Grandpa, please don't go!
Please, grandpa!
Grandpa, don't go!
Please, grandpa!
Papa, you've got to stop him.
You can't let him go.
We love you.
[ Crying ]
Please, grandpa!
Please don't go.
Grandpa.
Grandpa.
Grandpa.
[ Calvin ]
Mayo...
Come back here.
[ Crying ]
If grandpa's goin', then I'm goin' too.
[ Calvin ]
Mayo.
Did you hear me?
I wish we hadn't even heard about Dakota,
[ sobbing ]
Let alone...
Let alone comin' here.
[ Children crying ]
I don't see any reason to review what happened at the school that day.
Indeed, I think some of you parents have already heard more than you care to hear.
[ Crowd murmuring ]
I'm going to ask miss bower...
If she has any statements she would care to make.
[ Crowd chattering ]
I wish you would all understand this:
Anything my grandfather did, he did out of the goodness of his heart.
He didn't mean to do anything wrong.
[ Crowd groaning ]
[ Gavel pounding ]
You will all have your opportunity to speak.
Now, shall we behave like adults and allow miss bower to continue...
Without interruption?
[ Quiet murmuring ]
And actually,
I can't see the harm in anything my grandfather did.
He merely... miss bower, do you mean that you approve of what he did?
[ Crowd murmuring ]
I mean...
If we're going to educate the children,
I don't see why...
I can't see any harm...
In letting them hear both sides of the question.
What do you mean, "both sides"?
This question of statehood has already been settled.
[ Loud agreeing ]
We've worked hard to get it settled.
That's not what
I'm talking about.
[ Wrenn ]
Let me ask you one thing.
When your grandfather went there to the school to poison the minds...
Mr. bower's too much of a gentleman...
[ Shouting ]
[ Gavel pounding ]
Mr. wampler, sit down!
To poison the minds of the children, did he do so with your knowledge and consent?
I knew where he was going, yes,
[ crowd murmuring ]
But I don't think he poisoned any minds.
Now, wait just a minute!
Let me get one thing straight!
I was the one that sent her grandfather there...
To the schoolhouse that morning.
[ Crowd ] You were?
Not Alice.
Not miss bower.
Alice?
Joe, you promised.
I'm not gonna watch you get ripped apart...
For something that wasn't even your fault.
Don't say another word.
You just don't realize.
Your board questioned this young teacher extensively.
She assured us that nothing of thi...
[ man ]
Well, who invited him here?
What's he doing here?
[ Crowd murmuring ]
[ Man ]
Of all the nerve!
[ Murmuring continues ]
Now that Mr. bower is here,
I'd just like to ask him a couple of questions.
So would we.
Yeah, we would too.
Isn't it true,
Mr. bower... no! Stop it!
There's no need to go on with your meeting any more.
And there's no need to vote on whether or not to fire me...
Because I quit, as of right now.
[ Crowd ]
Good. That's good.
[ Joe ]
Alice, you're being foolish.
Maybe I don't know your grandfather as well as you do, but even he wouldn't want you to take the blame for something that he did.
Don't you understand anything at all?
He left because he thought we didn't want him...
I'm all for family loyalty.
I think it's a wonderful thing.
But there are limits to all things!
Including my Patience!
Now, will you just leave me alone?
Alice, will you listen?
[ Horse whinnies ]
Whoa!
[ Sighs ]
May I escort you up the street, miss bower?
Delighted, Mr. stubbins.
Until such time as we can find another teacher, meanwhile, the school will be closed.
Now, if there's no further business to be brought before the board...
I got something to say.
[ Angry murmuring ]
[ Gavel pounding ]
I will not have this meeting...
Turned into another political debate or debacle!
What I got to say,
I don't think anybody's gonna argue with.
If we was to pick out the worse thing that could possibly happen, that would be to have that school closed again...
When it just barely got open.
Yeah, that's right.
The point is...
If I'd have took time to thought about it...
I'd have realized
I was doin' wrong.
Movin' into that school that way, passin' on ideas that
I happen to believe in.
Well, I tell you, that's been one of my troubles...
All my life.
I don't generally stop and think...
'Til after it's too late.
But this time I got it all thought out ahead, and I'd like to make you just a little proposition.
What kind of a proposition?
[ Loud murmuring ]
What kind of a proposition?
Well, you get hold of Alice and talk her into takin' the job back as teacher...
And you'll keep that school open.
[ Crowd ]
That's a good idea.
That's fair.
And I give you my solemn promise,
I won't say one other word about politics...
Or whether Dakota oughta be one state or two...
Until the whole thing has been settled for good.
And then there ain't much use to say nothin' after that.
[ Crowd murmuring ]
He is absolutely right!
[ Loud chattering ]
[ Knocking ]
It ain't locked.
Just give a little push.
Just come over to tell you that both
Katie and I think...
It was a fine, generous thing you did this morning.
We were proud of you.
Goin' somewhere?
I thought maybe.
Any place special in mind?
You figure it'd be easier just to run off...
Rather than to stay here and face it day by day.
I just wonder what people...
What people might say, that's all.
You haven't forgotten that bet you made with Joe carder the first day we came to town.
Some of the boys have got a wheelbarrow all decorated up, ready for the payoff.
Seems like if you left town now, they might say that you were running out on a bet.
They probably figured you were afraid you'd lose.
Afraid I'd lose!
Do you want to know something?
In my whole life
I've never been more...
Well,
I can't discuss that without gettin' mixed up in something
I promised not to talk about.
Oh, and another thing.
The family band has been invited to play...
At the rapid city election carnival, the night the returns come in.
Trouble is, we haven't had a band practice since you left.
Confound it, Calvin!
You're supposed to be the head of the family.
You ought to see to it.
The whole family's been kind of upset.
Upset or not, that don't matter!
You gonna have a band, you got to practice, practice, practice!
Mostly we need you, pa.
Why don't you come home where you belong?
I know you'd let me wait my life out, you'd never give in.
So I'm askin' you.
Please?
For Katie and the children...
And me.
What do you say?
Seems like if we was to get started instead of standin' here talkin', maybe we'd get there in time for supper.
That election night thing is gonna be our first real chance to show off the family band.

I know some of you have been bitterly disappointed.
[ Crowd murmuring ]
I want to pass along to you...
Something that was told me many years ago...
By a man whom I have respected and admired...
More than any man
I have ever met.
A man who never wavered in his conviction...
That we here together can build the greatest...
United country in the whole bloomin' world...
If you'll just remember one thing.
There's a time to stand up and fight for what you believe in...
[ murmured agreements ]
And there is a time to join hands and work together,
or all the fighting doesn't mean a thing.
He's just makin' that up.
Wasn't no important man at all.
Just something I told him.
I know that this man...
Swallowed more disappointment than any of you did tonight.
This was back in '65...
When he had just returned home from appomattox.
My father, rensselaer bower.
Where is he?
Where is he?
Here he is!
Here he is.
And so I suggest that this is a time for joining hands, a time for making up.
Well, if he's gonna quote such a good authority,
I guess I can't argue with him.

[Inspiring music]
He was a good man, davie.
Yes, sir.
Here's the key to the schoolhouse, sir.
Thank you.
I'll go with you as far as the ford.
Yes, sir.
Well, davie, are you sorry to leave this place?
I could answer that, mr. Campbell,
If i knew where i was going or what was likely
To become of me.
'Tis a good place indeed.
But then i've never been anywhere else.
[Chuckles]
And now that my father's dead, i'm-
I'm no nearer to him here
Than i would be in the kingdom of hungary.
To tell you the truth, sir, if i knew i was going
Where i could better myself,
I should be leaving with a good heart.
Very well, davie.
Then it behooves me to tell you your fortune.
Or so far as i may.
You see, davie, when your father,
That worthy christian man, began to sicken for his end,
He gave me this letter, which he said was your inheritance.
"So soon as i am gone," said he,
"Give my boy this letter in his hand
"And start him off for the house of shaws near cramond.
It was there i came from," he said.
"And it's there it befits my boy should return."
The house of shaws?
What did my father to do with the house of shaws?
Who can say?
But the name of the family is the name you bear-
Balfour of shaws.
"To the hand of ebenezer balfour, esquire, of shaws,
"In his house of shaws,
This will be delivered by my son, david balfour."
Mr. Campbell, if you were in my shoes,
Would you go?
Indeed i would.
A lad like you should get there in but two days of walk.
Good-Bye, mr. Campbell.
May god be with ye.
And, davie!
Yes, sir?
Mind you do not shame us
In yon great house with all those domestics,
Upper and under.
Show yourself as nice and circumspect as any.
Yes, sir.
And as for the laird.
Remember, he's the laird.
I'll say no more.
It's a pleasure to obey a laird
Or should be to the young.
Of course, sir.
Good-Bye, sir.
Good-Bye, davie.
[Rattling]
Which way is cramond?
Down the road, mannie.
Have you heard of a house by there
That they call the house of shaws?
Aye.
'Tis a great house?
Aye.
But the folk that are in it?
Folk?
Are you daft?
There's no folk there
To be called folk.
Not mr. Ebenezer balfour?
Ou, ay, there's the laird, to be sure,
If it's him you're wanting.
It's none of my affairs,
But you seem a decent-Spoken lad.
And if you'll take a word from me,
You'll steer clear of the shaws.
Mother.
Which way is the house of shaws?
The house of shaws?
- Aye.
- That is the house of shaws.
Blood built it,
Blood stopped the building of it,
And blood will bring it down.
And if you see the laird,
Tell him what you hear-
That this makes the 1, 219th time
That jennet clouston has called down her curse
On his house, byre, and stable,
Man, guest, or master,
Wife, miss, or bairn!
Black be their fall.
[Tapping]
[Birds cawing]
[Knocking]
[Coughs]
Is anybody there?
[Coughs]
Is anybody there?
Is mr. Balfour there?
Open this door.
You can hear me!
Open this door!
[Creaking]
It's loaded.
I'm here with a letter to mr. Ebenezer balfour.
Then put it down on the doorstep, and be off with ye.
I will not.
'Tis a letter of introduction.
And i will deliver it to mr. Balfour's own hands.
And who are yourself?
A balfour just as he is-
David balfour.
Is your father dead?
Aye, he'll be dead no doubt,
And that'll be what brings you to my door.
Enter the kitchen, will ye?
And touch nothing!
Are you sharp-Set?
Can you eat that drop of porridge?
But no doubt that's your own supper.
Oh, i can do fine wanting it.
I'll take that bit of small beer.
It slockens my cough.
Now give me alexander's letter.
How did you know my father's name?
It'd be strange if i didn't,
For he was my born brother.
And little as you seem to like me
Or my house or my good porridge,
I'm your born uncle and you, davie,
My born nephew.
So the letter's for me and for nobody else in the world.
Now sit down and fill your belly.
Do you ken what's in this?
The seal wasn't broken.
You saw that yourself.
Aye, but what brought you here?
You'll have had some hopes, no doubt.
Aye, sir.
When i heard that i had kinfolk well-To-Do,
I did think they might help me in life.
But i want no favors that are not freely given.
Hoot-Toot, do not fly up in the snuff at me.
If you're done with that bit of porridge,
I could just take a sup of it myself.
Has your father been long dead?
Three weeks, sir.
He was a secret man, alexander-
A secret, silent man.
He'll never have spoken much of me?
I never knew he had a brother
Till you told me so yourself.
Dear me.
And the house of shaws?
He never spoke of that either, i dare say.
Not so much as the name.
To think of that.
Strange nature of a man.
And now come away to your bed.
Yes, sir.
[Key rattling]
We'll agree fine yet, davie, my man.
I'm just as glad i let you in.
Good night, dear davie.
Will you leave me no candle?
Did nobody ever tell you that a candle costs money?
[Key rattles]
Ebenezer balfour, esquire... of shaws... in his house of shaws.
Your breakfast's ready!
Bond, wholesome food porridge.
And cheap.
Aye, and cheap.
I don't imagine that you'd take small beer
To your breakfast.
I do, but don't put yourself out.
No, no, i'll deny you nothing
In reason.
[Chuckling] you see, davie,
You came to the right place
When you came to your uncle ebenezer
For i have a great notion of the family,
And i mean to do right by ye.
But i'm a poor man.
Never forget that.
For my father sinfully wasted the estate
When he began to rebuild this house.
Mind ye, i sent the workmen packing ten minutes
After he was dead, but it was too late, davie.
It was too late.
That's not how jennet clouston tells it.
Jennet clouston?
And what did jennet clouston say?
That blood built it,
Blood stopped the building of it,
And blood will bring it down.
And she told me to tell you
That this makes the 1,219th time
That she called down a curse on your house.
A witch. A proclaimed witch.
That's every day since i had her sold up.
I'm off to see the session clerk.
I'll have her roasted in red peats
Before i'm by with her.
There's too much here.
I can't leave you by yourself in the house.
I'll have to lock you out.
If you lock me out,
It'll be the last you see of me in friendship.
David, this is not the way to win my favor.
Sir, with a proper reverence for our common blood,
I do not value your favor at the penny's purchase.
And if you are all the uncle
And all the family i have in the world,
I wouldn't buy your liking at those prices.
Well-Ell, we must bear and forbear.
I'll not go.
That's all that's to be said of it.
[Lightning crashes]
[Thunder]
When my father was little,
Was he quick at his book?
Alexander?
[Chuckles]
Not him.
I was far quicker myself.
I was a clever chappie when i was young.
I found this on the shelf.
"To my brother ebenezer
On his fifth birthday."
In my father's own hand.
Yet you are the laird of shaws.
So wasn't he younger than you?
What made you ask that?
Because if he wrote this when he was only four,
He must have been very quick indeed at his book.
And take your hands from my jacket.
This is no way to behave.
You shouldn't speak to me of your father, davie.
That's where the mistake is.
He was all the brother that ever i had.
[Thunder]
Nevertheless, there are things that i don't understand.
And whether you like me to speak of my father
Or whether you do not,
I intend to find them out.
So be it, davie.
So be it.
Go on up there.
At the top of the tower, there's a wee room
With a chest in it.
Bring the chest down to me.
There are papers in it that'll tell you everything.
Very well.
Uh, do not take the light.
I'm not well, davie.
I'm an old man, and i'm not well.
Get along, lad.
Get along.
[Gasps]
[Thunder]
Are you alive?
Oh, man, are you alive?
That i am, and small thanks to you.
The wee bottle on the mantelpiece.
[Whimpers]
It's the trouble.
The trouble, davie.
It's the heart.
[Hiccups]
You're quite well enough to speak now.
So follow on with your explanation.
And now you have one more thing to explain-
Why you tried to kill me.
For pity's sake, let me go to my bed, davie.
I'll tell you everything the morning.
As sure as death i will.
Very well.
But this is where you'll sleep.
- Good night to ye.
- Good night, uncle ebenezer.
[Locks door]
[Knocking at door]
What cheer, mate?
Here's a letter for your master.
From captain hoseason himself.
And who might captain hoseason be?
Never heard of hoseason,
Captain of the brig covenant?
And a man what minds for nothing
In heaven nor on earth.
Why, he'd crack on all sail into the day of judgment, he would.
And i'm his cabin boy and proud of it.
You see, davie,
I have a trading venture with this man hoseason.
And now he writes that he's ashore at queensferry
And ready to sail.
Look for yourself.
He wants to meet me at the inn
For we have business to settle.
So have we.
And ours comes first.
No, no, davie man, do not be hasty.
For after all that's come and gone,
I doubt if you would believe me upon my naked word.
Your doubt is right.
But, you see, there he writes
Of mr. Rankeillor, the lawyer.
Now after we're done at the inn, we'll jog on to mr. Rankeillor,
And there's a man you will believe.
For he's lawyer to half the gentry in these parts-
An old man, forby, highly respected,
And he knew your father.
Very well.
We'll go to the inn
And directly afterwards to mr. Rankeillor.
What do they think of mr. Ebenezer here abouts?
That he's a wicked old man.
Many would like to see him dancing at the end of a rope.
Jennet clouston, all the other folks
He's hurried out of hearth and home.
He was a fine young fellow once,
But that was before the report went out about mr. Alexander.
Mr. Alexander?
What was the report about mr. Alexander?
Only that ebenezer killed him.
You never hear that, man?
What would he kill him for?
Just to get the place.
The house of shaws?
No other place that i ken.
Then my--Then alexander was the eldest son.
Indeed he was.
What else would he have killed him for?
Master davie, your uncle tells me great things of you.
I wish i was for longer here
That we might make the better friends.
But you must come aboard my brig for half an hour
Till the ebb sets and drink a bowl with me.
Well, i'm on my way to mr. Rankeillor, the lawyer.
And so is my uncle.
Aye, he passed me word of that.
But the boat'll set you ashore at the town pier.
Rankeillor's... take care of that old fox.
He means mischief.
Come on board till i can get a word with ye.
We must be fast on board.
Welcome to my ship, mr. Balfour.
And now let me show you the lie of her.
Mind ye, she's only a small, trading boat,
Sailing for the most part from here to the carolinas.
But she's home to me, mr. Balfour.
That's my berth.
Now since the mates are never off duty together.
They use the other- Turn and turnabout.
Here i keep all the valuable of the ship stores-
Brandy, for instance.
But to tell the truth,
My first mate's only too fond of that.
In here, pistols, powder, and shot.
You never know what sort of ruffian
You may ship up on your crew.
- Over here--
- Wasn't there something
You were going to tell me?
Something about my uncle?
Was there, young man?
Was something about my old friend mr. Ebenezer?
Where is my uncle?
That's the point, young man.
Come back!
Come back!
Bring back that boat!
[Creaking]
Take the boy out of this hole
And put him in the forecastle.
Why should he not bide here?
After what you did to him
And the fever he has in consequence,
It wouldn't be beyond him to die in a place like this.
Well, you was paid to get rid of him, wasn't you?
Mr. Shaun, you've been with me three cruises,
And if you'd spent less time at the bottle,
You might have got to know me.
I'm a stiff man, and i'm a dour man,
But i'm a man of principle.
And i'll have no part in murder.
Very noble of you.
Besides, if he's dead when we reach the carolinas,
He'll not be worth a scotch shilling.
Mr. Shaun, take the boy to the forecastle.
Drunk or sober, you'll obey my orders.
Take him to the forecastle,
And be quick about it.
Told you that's where he should have been
In the first place.
One day, he'll go too far.
Look. I'm sick and tired of being knocked about.
And, one day, i'm gonna use it.
Well, who got you into this?
My uncle.
Gah, i'm lucky.
Don't have no relations at all.
I had a father once, though.
I remember he kept a jackdaw in the parlor
What could whistle rule, brittania!
But i ain't heard tell of him or the jackdaw
Since i went to sea when i was nine.
I'd tell you how long ago that was,
But i lost count.
Come on.
Can you walk, matey?
I think so.
Lean on me.
I'm little, but i'm strong.
What did your uncle want to get rid of you for?
I don't know the whole fact of it yet.
But he's a crafty, old miser who's stolen an estate
That doesn't belong to him.
Who do it belong to?
Me.
And when i get out of here, i'll be rich.
Well, ain't that lucky.
But you know something, matey, it may be a longish time.
Didn't you hear what they said about the carolinas?
It's as plain as the nose on your face.
The captain's planning to sell you off as a 20-Pounder.
A 20-Pounder?
You know what they is.
Indentured servants on the plantations.
Yes, matey,
You may be rich,
But you'll be hoeing tobacco in the carolinas
For the next seven years.
Mr. Balfour, you mustn't think i hold anything
Against you personally.
An uncle must be judge of what's best for his nephew,
For the ways of providence are inscrutable.
Very well.
If you wish-
[Indistinct arguing]
Mr. Shaun!
Mr. Shaun!
[Boy screams]
I knew it would come.
Mr. Shaun has done for him at last.
Mr. Balfour... mr. Balfour, move your berth aft.
You'll serve in the deckhouse in his place.
You were not here before.
There was another boy.
Yes, sir.
I thought so.
The boy is dead, mr. Shaun.
The boy is dead?
That was the other boy.
The other boy's dead.
[Glass shatters]
You sot and you swine,
Do you know what you've done?
You've murdered the boy.
Balfour, put him in his bunk.
Go on.
Do as i say.
He made me throw away a bottle of brandy,
And there's no sense in that.
Here, get me another one from the locker over there.
Balfour, this night's work must never be known.
The lad went overboard, that's it.
That's what the story is.
And i'd give five pounds out of my pocket
If it were true.
[Snores]
Listening for the breakers.
We're not past the hebrides,
And weather like this you don't see in ireland,
You hear it.
Look out!
Starboard!
Hard to starboard.
Hard to starboard, sir.
A fishing boat from the shore.
We must have cut her in two.
What were they about on a night like this?
It's no use lowering a boat.
There's a man here on the bowsprit.
When we struck, her stern went in the air.
He must have jumped for the bowsprit.
There's something strange about this.
That's no ordinary fisherman.
Good evening to you, captain.
It seems to me you keep a poor lookout on this ship.
I could say the same about the crew of your boat.
You have nothing against them, sir.
They were my friends,
And now they're at the bottom of the sea.
You have a scottish tongue in your head,
But the french king's uniform on your back.
You see ill in that, sir?
Now there's no need to do a mischief
Before you see the need of it.
There's many a highland gentleman
Who fought for prince charlie in the year '45
And, when he was beaten, followed him to france.
Are you one of us, captain?
No, sir.
I'm for king george, i'm a true-Blue whig,
And i thank god for it.
But for all that, i can be sorry to see a man
With his back to the wall.
David.
Very well, i'll be plain with you.
I was on my way back to france,
And there was a french ship
Cruising here to pick me up,
But we missed in the fog.
And if i get into the hands
Of any of the red-Coated gentry,
Very likely it'll go hard with me.
So if you can take me to where i was going,
I'll reward you highly for your trouble.
To france?
No, sir, that i cannot do.
But to set you ashore where you came up from...
[coins clinking]
Now we might talk about that.
Half of what's here, and i'm your man.
The money's not mine.
It belongs to my chief.
And i wouldn't use it to buy my carcass any too dearly.
30 guineas if you set me on shore at the linnhe loch.
You can take it if you like, or do your worst.
And if i hand you over to the red coats?
You'll be making a fool's bargain.
My chief has forfeited, and his estates are in the hands
Of the man from hanover that they call king george.
And his officers collect the rents or try to,
Because, for the honor of scotland,
The tenants have not forgotten their chief in exile,
And they send their rents to him under the nose of king george.
And this is it--The money king george is looking for.
So, you see, sir,
You could bring it within reach of the government-
How much of it will come to you?
Little enough to be sure,
If they knew whose money it was.
But i think, if i was to try,
I could hold my tongue about that.
And i'll have you there too.
Play me false, and i play you cunning.
If a hand is laid upon me,
They'll know what money this is.
Very well.
What must be must.
30 guineas and done.
Here's my hand on it.
And mine.
[Door opens and shuts]
Well, boy, doubtless this is the first time
You've seen a wicked rebel.
Aye, sir.
By your long face, you should be a whig.
I am for king george, my lawful king.
He's not the--Well, we won't quarrel about that just now.
Your bottle's dry.
It's hard if i'm to pay
30 guineas to be denied a dram
On the back of it.
I'll fetch the key, sir.
It's not an easy thing with no pistols with us,
Only our cutlasses.
And the man has a look of a fighting man.
I take your meaning, mr. Shaun,
But i'll give you my word.
You'll get your finger on half the guineas in his purse.
Does that satisfy you?
Aye.
Better where he is.
He hasn't room to use his sword.
We'll keep the man in talk.
Well, what is it?
The gentleman's seeking a dram,
And the bottle's out.
Very well.
- David.
- Yes, sir?
Do you know where the pistols are?
In the locker by the other door.
You see, david, that wild highlander
Is a danger to my ship,
Besides being a foe to king george, god bless him.
Now the trouble is that all our firelocks
Are in the deckhouse under this man's nose,
Likewise the powder.
Now, if we were to go in and take them,
He might fall to thinking.
But a lad like you might snap up
A powder horn and a pistol or two
Without remark.
If you can do it cleverly,
I'll bear it in mind
When it'll be good for you to have friends-
And that's when we come to the carolinas.
Aye, sir.
One of our good captain's pipes
And his excellent carolina tobacco.
There's no other way, sir.
I have to tell you.
Tell me what?
That they're planning to kill you.
But it's true, sir.
They're all murderers here.
They've murdered a boy already,
And now it's to be you.
Would you stand with me?
I will.
It'll be the two of us against the whole ship.
I'll stand with you, sir.
Well, then.
What's your name?
David balfour... of shaws.
And mine's stewart.
Alan breck stewart.
Now, mr. Balfour, let's look to our defenses.
I have my sword and my dirk.
You'll have to make do with a sailor's cutlass.
I have the key to the pistols, sir.
Good. Then you can fight like a gentleman.
Now there are two doors, four windows,
All weather-Boarded.
You bolt your door... yes, sir.
And i'll open mine.
Why open it?
Now don't argue with me so soon, mr. Balfour.
That door is the best part of my defenses.
I only have one face,
And if the door is open
And my face towards it,
The best part of my enemies will be in front of me,
Where i would always wish them to be.
Your post is at the window.
And don't fire to this side unless they get me down.
I'd sooner have ten foes in front of me
Than one friend cracking pistols at my back.
This is a strange return of a hospitality.
Sir, i am come of kings.
And i bear the king's name,
And this sword has slashed the heads off more whigs
Than you have toes to your feet.
So call your vermin to your back... and fall on.
I'll mind this, balfour.
Now let your hand rule your head,
For the grip is coming.
Mr. Shaun, you will attack to the open door
Where no doubt they expect the main battle.
While you engage them there,
My men will break through the door on the other side.
As you will.
Ye afraid, mr. Balfour?
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir, i am.
Bravely said.
There's many a fine, handsome gentleman
That wouldn't a-Dared to say it.
Very well, mr. Shaun.
Come on.
[Shouting]
That's him that killed the boy.
Look through your window.
Right, break it down.
[Gunshot]
[Moans]
[Gunshots]
Hey, come back!
Come back!
I've settled two.
How about you, mr. Balfour?
- I think i winged the captain.
- Good.
That makes three.
There's not enough blood let.
They'll be back again.
[Muffled whispering] i can hear them.
I think they're planning something.
That's just what we want.
Unless we can give them a distaste of us
And be done with it,
There'll be neither sleep for you nor me.
[Creaking]
They're all around us.
Aye, mr. Balfour.
And this time, they'll be in earnest.
[Whistle blows]
[Gunshot]
[shouts]
Mr. Balfour, mr. Balfour!
Mr. Balfour!
Get below, you scurvy rats.
[Laughs]
[Footsteps]
Man, am i not a bonny fighter?
David balfour, i love you like a brother.
[Sobbing]
Oh, is it because you've killed a man?
I ken what you're feeling.
I remember it myself.
When i was an age to you.
It's rest you're needing.
I'll take the first watch
And clean up this filth.
There's one thing i mislike about your tale
Than the villainy of your uncle,
And that is that your minister has the name of campbell.
Mr. Campbell.
But he's a man you'd be proud to give your hand to.
I'd give nothing to a campbell,
Unless it were a leaden bullet.
If i was dying, i'd crawl on my knees
To a window to get a shot at one.
What ails you at the campbells?
I'm an appine stewart.
And the campbells have long harried and wasted
The people of my name.
Aye, and taken lands of us out of treachery
And never with a sword.
Heh. What happened
When the clans were broken at culloden,
And the good cause came down, and the horses ran up
To their fetlocks in the best blood of the north,
And my chieftain had to flee like a deer in the mountain
And his lady and his bairn?
And the campbells stripped him of his land
And plucked the weapons out of the hands of the clansmen
That held arms for 30 centuries.
Aye, and the very clothes from their backs,
For now it is a crime to wear a plaid tartan.
And a man may be cast into jail
That he has a kilt about his legs.
But the one thing they couldn't kill
Was the love they bore their chieftain.
These guineas are proof of that.
Then there steps in a campbell-
Red-Headed colin roy that men call the red fox.
He gets a paper from king george
That he's an agent in the lands of appin.
And when he finds out
The tenants are sending their rents overseas
To their chieftain, the black campbell blood in him runs wild.
Oh, will a stewart get a piece of bread
That i cannot prevent it.
So he's sending for lawyers and papers and red coats
To stand at his back.
And soon the kindly folk of the country
Will have to pack and tramp,
Each father's son from his father's home
And from the lands where he was fed and bred
And played as a lad.
[Chuckles]
The red fox-- If ever i get you at gun's end,
The lord have pity on you.
I mean that, david.
If a day comes when i have time and leisure
For a bit of hunting, there's not enough heather grows
In scotland that can hide him from my vengeance.
It seems to me, mr. Stewart,
That you're neither very wise nor very christian
To blow off so many words in anger.
For they will do the man you call the red fox no harm
And yourself no good.
That's a good observe,
Barring that about christianity,
Of which my opinion is quite otherwise,
But i'm much of your mind.
Opinion here or opinion there,
It's a known fact that christianity forbids revenge.
Aye?
It's easily seen that a campbell taught you.
It'd be a very convenient world for them and their sort
If there was no such thing
As a lad with a gun behind a heather bush.
[Chuckles]
But you're a grand man in a fight, david,
Even though you have whig blood in you.
These i had from my father.
And he from his father before him.
Here, a keepsake for the fight we made together.
And wherever you go, if you show that button,
The friends of alan breck will come around you.
Balfour, tell your friend i'm here for a parlay.
Will you give me your word you'll try no treachery?
I do.
I give my word.
Put those things up.
Have i not passed my word?
I doubt not your word is breakable.
Last night, you haggled and argle-Bargled
Like an apple-Wife, then gave me your word
And your hand to back it,
And you ken well what was the upshot.
Be damned to your word.
You'll get little good by swearing.
And there are other things to speak of.
You've made a sore hash of my brig.
I've not men enough to work her.
There's nothing left but to run south to glasgow
For fresh hands.
And you'll have a bonny tale to tell there.
A dozen tarry sailors on the one side,
A man and a halfling boy up on the other.
Oh, it's pitiful.
Tell 'em what you like.
But first set me ashore as we agreed,
And my friend too,
For i intend to see him on his way to his estate.
How can i put you ashore?
My first officer's dead.
You know best how.
There's none of us acquainted with this coast.
And it's one very dangerous to ships.
You want the 30 guineas or do you not?
If you do, set me on dry land at appine,
Morven, or ardgour-
Anywhere within 20 miles of my own country,
Excepting the country of the campbells.
That's a broad target.
If you miss it, you must be as feckless
At sailoring as i found you at fighting.
It's to risk my brig and your lives along with her.
Take it or want it.
As you will.
But if i'd lost less money on this unchancy cruise,
I'd see you with a rope's end before i risked my ship.
Are you acquainted with this coast?
I've been picked up and set down in it often enough.
Then come and help me pilot my ship.
Is this one of your tricks?
Do i look like tricks?
My brig's in danger.
What do you call that?
The sea breaking on the reef.
So you know where the reef is.
What better do you want?
Aye, if it was the only one.
If i'd known about these reefs, it's not 30 guineas,
No, nor yet 300 would have made me risk my brig
In such a stone yard.
I'm thinking that's what they call the torran rocks.
Are there many of them?
I'm no pilot, but it sticks in my mind
That there's ten miles of them.
Is there a way through them?
Doubtless, but where?
It also runs through my mind
It's clearer in under the land.
Very well, sir.
We'll try your way of it.
But i may as well trust to a blind fiddler.
Pray god you're right.
Pray god i am.
Hard to port!
Hard to port.
Hard to port, sir.
This is not the kind of death i fancy.
You're not afraid, are you?
No, but i'm more of a fighting man than a sailor man,
And you'll allow it's a very cold ending.
Clear water ahead, sir!
You were right, sir.
You've saved my brig.
And i'll mind that when we come to clear accounts.
Bring her up a point.
One more reef to leeward.
A point to port.
A point to port, sir.
Easy now.
Easy.
[Gusting wind]
[Wood creaking]
Look out, forward!
Hold on.
Hold on!
[Speaking gaelic]
You're wasting your breath.
I'm no highlander, and i have no gaelic.
[Speaking gaelic]
You mean you're going to steal from that stinking tub.
Don't fuss yourself, for i'll not interfere with you.
[Speaks gaelic] och, no.
I was swept ashore last night
On the other side of the island.
And all i want is someone to guide me to the mainland.
Well, that'll cost you two shillings.
So you do have english.
Only when it's needful.
Did you see anyone from the ship?
- Aye.
- Did any get ashore?
Aye, they went away to the mainland.
A man dressed like a gentleman
With a uniform under his coat?
Aye, there was a great gout like that.
Oh, no two shillings to guide you,
But then you'll be hungry, and i'll have to give you food.
And when i'm gone, maybe someone else will come
And find this wreck of mine
And take what doesn't belong to him.
All together it'll cost you five shillings.
You said two shillings!
Oh, well, find your own way then, manny.
Very well.
Five shillings.
Come then.
There's where you go, manny.
Over the hills and far away.
And where you go too.
I paid you good silver to guide me.
[Speaks gaelic]
I know what will bring your english back.
[Coins rattle] aye, another five shillings,
And i'll lead you to the ferry.
You're a cheat, and you're a liar.
And i'd starve to my death in the mountains
Before i gave you one penny more.
Give me five shillings in my hand.
[Dog barks; gulls cry]
Is it you that keeps a ferry?
Everybody knows that.
I'm seeking somebody,
And it comes in my mind that you may have news of him.
His name is alan breck stewart.
I am very much affronted.
This is not the way
The clan gentleman should behave to another.
The man you ask for is in france,
But if he were in my sporran and your belly full of shillings,
I would not hurt a hair of his head.
[Barks]
Now pick up your dirty money and be off with you.
Yes, sir.
Just a minute.
Are you, by any chance, a shipwrecked man?
Aye.
And have you, by any other chance,
A silver button?
Yes, sir.
Well, i think you might have started
With that end of the stick, whatever.
Now come you with me to my boat,
For i've the word to see you come safe.
Two things i tell you plain, young man.
There is a name you must never take in your mouth,
And that's the name of alan breck.
And there's a thing you must never do,
And that is to offer your money to a highland gentleman.
Well, i've just left one over on the other side
Who wouldn't do anything without it.
There are highland gentlemen and highland gentlemen.
And as you are only a lowlander,
You have not the sense to tell the one from the other.
[Dog barks]
It's the land of appin-
And a hard country for men to care as much about
As the appine stewarts do.
Yonder is duror of appin,
And there you must ask for james of the glens,
Who is brother to the chief.
Your friend is on his way there
And will join you when he can.
When he can?
The noise is that colin roy campbell,
The man they call the red fox,
Is coming with his soldiers to turn the stewarts
Out of hearth and home.
It's a chancy day in appin,
And you must take care to walk softly.
But i'm no jacobite or no rebel,
For i was born a true-Blue whig.
We can none of us help what we were born.
[Jangling]
Well, boy, where are you off to?
To duror of appin, sir.
And if you know it, i'd be obliged
If you'll tell me where i will find james of the glens.
James of the glens.
There's many a man who would think this is an omen.
Here am i on my road to duror
For the job that you ken,
And a young lad waits in a wood
And asks me for james of the glens.
This is an ill subject for jest, mr. Campbell.
Very well.
What does it mean?
Does it mean that james is gathering his people against us?
If you're thinking of me, sir,
I am neither of his people nor of yours,
But an honest subject of king george,
Owing no man and fearing no man.
Very well said, sir.
But if i may make so bold,
What does an honest man so far from his country?
And why does he seek james of the glens,
Brother to the chief of appin?
I have power here, sir, i must tell you.
I am the king's agent
With 12 files of soldiers at my back.
If you'd asked me for james of the glens
On any other day but this,
I should have set you right and bidden you godspeed.
But today when you ask me this,
Today-
Take care, sir.
[Gunshot]
[Gasps]
Mr. Campbell.
Mr. Campbell.
There he is!
Stop that boy!
He's an accomplice, posted here to keep us in talk.
Ten pounds if you take him.
Follow them!
[Gunfire]
- In here.
- Alan.
Come on.
Spread out!
Spread out!
There they go.
[Gunfire]
In here.
Come on.
[Sighs]
Well, yon was a hot burst.
[Groans]
Are you still wearied?
No, i'm not wearied now,
And i can speak.
I liked you very well, alan breck,
But now a campbell man lies dead on the road,
And your ways are not my ways,
And they're not god's ways.
And the long and the short of it is that we must part.
Oh, so that's it.
Well, let me tell you, mr. Balfour of shaws,
If i was gonna kill a man, i wouldn't do it
In my own country and bring trouble on my clan,
Nor would i set out to shoot him without any gun in my hand.
You mean you had nothing to do with it?
I swear by the holy iron
That i had neither art nor part, thought nor act in it.
Such a fuss about a campbell.
They're not so scarce.
That i ken.
Still, you do know who did do it.
Well, i wouldn't conscientiously swear to it.
But he must have run close past you.
Aye, to be sure.
But it's a strange thing that, just at that moment,
I was tying my shoe.
Further more, if i had seen him,
I have a grand memory for forgetting.
And another thing,
It seemed to me that, once or twice,
You exposed yourself to draw the soldiers after us.
That's very likely.
And if you were in the shoes of the lad that fired the bullet,
You'd be a deal obliged for it.
You see, mr. Balfour, them that haven't dipped their hands
In any little difficulty should be very mindful
Of the case of them that have.
And that's the good christianity.
Well, i'll not say it's the good christianity
As i understand it,
But it's good enough.
[Chuckles]
Tomorrow there'll be a fine to-Do in appin.
You and i must be far away.
You and i?
You may have reason to run from the red coats,
But it seems to me that i'm running away
From plain, common sense.
Alan, this is no quarrel of mine.
My quarrel is with my uncle,
And eager i am to get back to settle it.
So let me go my way as an honest traveler.
And if they take me,
I've done nothing wrong.
And i'll trust to the justice of my country.
Justice!
[Laughs]
Man, sometimes i wonder about you.
That was a campbell that was killed.
If you're taken, you'll be tried at inverara,
The head place of the campbells,
With campbells swarming all over the jury box
And the biggest campbell of them all lording it on the bench.
No, david, we're in the highlands,
And if i tell you to run,
Take my word and run.
Mind you, i'll be no small thing.
You'll have to lie bare and hard and brook many an empty belly.
Your bed'll be the moorcocks,
And your life will be like a hunted deer's,
And you'll drag many a weary foot ere we get clear.
But if you ask me if you have another choice,
I'll answer, "none."
Either you take to the heather with me, or--Ssk!
You'll hang.
Well, that's a choice very easily made.
I'll prove myself a gomerel.
The day has found us where we never ought to be-
Glencoe, and a pass they're bound to watch.
Well, now it's no worse to go forward than back.
Spread out on the right!
Down there.
Come on.
Come on. Jump!
Jump!
[Whinnying]
[Metal clacks]
[Shouts in gaelic]
I'm me, alan breck stewart.
Alan breck stewart.
[Speaking gaelic]
We couldn't have fallen better. These are cluny's men.
We're to bide with them until they get word
To their chief that i'm here.
Well, i do not ken who cluny is,
And i do not care for his men,
But i would like finally to get some sleep.
Well, mr. Stewart, come awa', sir,
And bring in your friend that as yet i do not ken the name of.
And how's yourself, cluny?
You do brawly, i hope, sir.
I'm proud to see you.
And to present my friend, the laird of shaws, david balfour.
I'm glad to make the both of you welcome to my house.
It's a queer, rude place for certain,
But since my estates are forfeit and there's a price on my head,
This is one of the burrows that serves me well.
And now we'll take a dram for luck.
And as soon as these rascals of mine have the venison ready,
We'll dine.
And then we'll take a hand at the cards
As every gentleman should.
My life is very dry.
I see little company.
Just sit and twiddle my thumbs
And think of a great day gone by,
And weary for another great day
That we all hope is upon the road.
And so here's a toast to it-
To the restoration of our own true king.
Mr. Balfour was born a whig.
But i believe he's learning.
And now, gentlemen, let's stick a hand at the cards, eh?
- Good.
- Come, mr. Balfour.
Sit you down.
I don't play at cards, sir.
You--You--You do not play?
Why not?
Well, i've no call to judge others,
But i was taught that it was wrong to gamble.
In the devil's name, what kind of whiggish, canting talk
Is this for the house of cluny macpherson?
Sir, i'll put my hand in the fire for mr. Balfour.
I bear a king's name,
And any man i call friend is company for the best.
But now mr. Balfour is tired and must sleep.
In this poor house of mine, i'll have you to ken
That any gentleman may follow his pleasure.
If your friend would like to stand on his head,
He's welcome, but if he or you or any other gentleman
Is not precisely satisfied,
I'll be proud to step outside with him.
Sir, i am very wearied, as alan says.
And what's more, as you're a man who likely has sons of your own,
I may tell you that it was a promise to my father.
Well... say no more.
Say no more.
There's good heather to lie on,
And you may sleep if you must.
Yes, sir.
Have you got any money?
- A little.
- Well, give it to me.
- What for?
- For the loan, man.
Just for a loan.
But why?
We'll need the money.
David, would you begrudge me a loan?
For five guineas... for five guineas, aye.
[Coins clatter]
[Birds chirping]
[Speaks gaelic]
Well, have you rested quite enough, mr. Balfour?
For the news is that the road is clear in the south.
The sooner we start, the better.
The little money we have has a long way to carry us.
I've lost it, and that's the naked truth.
My money too?
You shouldn't have given it to me.
I'm daft when i get at the cards.
Toots-Toots, man, you'll have your money back.
It's not to be supposed that i'd be a hindrance
To gentlemen in your situation.
But can i take it, sir?
For my friend fairly lost my money,
And it puts me in a painful position.
You attack my conduct, sir?
No, but i ask your advice,
For whatever i do, it must be hard on a man with any pride.
Aye, and it's hard on me too,
For you give me the look of a man
Who has cheated poor people to their hurt.
I wouldn't have my friends come to my house
To accept affronts, no, nor yet to give them
As it seems that you're doing.
You see, sir, there is something
To be said on my side-
That gambling is a very poor employ for gentlemen.
[Sighing] mr. Balfour,
You're too nice and covenanting,
But, i must confess, you're a gentleman of spirit.
On my honest word, you may take this money.
It's what i would say to my own son.
And there's my hand on it.
[Chuckles]
Uh, this is no way for two friends
To take a small accident.
I-I have to say i'm sorry,
So it's said.
If you have anything, you better say it.
- No, i have nothing.
- Nothing?
After i said i'm to blame?
Why, of course you're to blame,
And you must bear me out that i never reproached you.
No, you've done worse.
I've long owed you my life,
And now i owe you money too.
You must try to make that burden easy for me.
You ask me to speak.
Well, then i will.
You own that you have done me a disservice.
And now you blame me because i cannot laugh or sing
As if i was glad of it.
And the next thing will be that i'm to go down on my knees
And thank you for it.
You should think more of others, alan breck,
And then perhaps you might speak less about yourself.
And when a friend has passed over an offense
Without so much as one word,
You would be glad to let it lie
Instead of making it a stick to break his back with.
Oh, well, we'll say no more.
[Coughing]
Seems to me that you're ill and can stand no more.
I am ill.
I know i'm ill.
But as to the other,
I can stand anything you can, mr. Stewart.
Further down the burren, there's bound to be a croft
Where i can find you shelter.
And the red coats too?
What silly talk is that?
David, i'm not a patient man.
I never said you were.
Mr. Balfour of shaws,
You're a stiff-Necked, ignorant whig.
And you, sir, are old enough to know your manners.
And from now on, i'll thank you to speak civilly of my king
And of the campbells too, who have never done me any harm.
Have a care, sir.
Do not forget i'm a stewart.
Oh, i know you bear a king's name.
But since i've been in the highlands,
I've seen many of those that do,
And the best i can say of them is this-
That they'd be none the worse for a good washing.
There are some things said that cannot be passed over.
I never asked you to, for i am as ready as yourself.
And i am no blowhard and boaster like some that i could name,
So come on!
David, don't be daft.
I cannot draw on you.
That was your lookout when you insulted me.
David, i cannot, i cannot.
Defend yourself, mr. Stewart.
Defend yourself!
Defend yourself.
Defend-
David!
"Described as 5'10" in height,
"Brown, bushy hair,
"Round-Shouldered, and a little knock-Kneed.
Shabby with an inclination to be genteel."
[Chuckles] so you've finished your sleep at last.
I told you we'd find a croft along the burren.
And by good fortune, donald dhu maclaren is of the right party.
- Alan.
- Hmm?
Can you forgive me for what i've said?
Hoot-Toot, you were so taken with fever,
You didn't know a thing you did.
Besides, that's precisely what i thought i liked about you,
Is the fact that you never quarreled.
Now i find i like you better.
When i heard there was a stranger here,
I did not think i would be so unchancy
As to find an appine stewart.
And when yon door opened,
The last kind of man i hoped to see
Was the son of rob roy macgregor.
Oh, indeed, sir.
Then i must console myself
With the bill i found on the way,
Which tells me that this painful meeting may be turned
To the profit of 100 pounds.
By a macgregor, no doubt.
For your tribe have long held money above honor.
There are words that i could say to that, sir,
But i think i will have heard
That you are a man of your sword.
Unless you were born deaf,
You'd have heard a great deal more than that.
Now when my chief drew steel on a gentleman of your name,
I never heard that it was a macgregor
That got the best of it.
You mean my father, sir, rob roy macgregor?
I wouldn't wonder at it.
My father was an old man,
And the match was unequal.
You and i would make a better pair.
I was thinking of that.
Gentlemen, gentlemen,
I've been thinking of a different matter, whatever.
Here are my pipes.
And here are you two gentlemen,
Both acclaimed pipers.
It is an old dispute which one of you is the best.
Here is a broad chance
To settle it.
Well, sir, have you music?
I can play like a macrimmon.
That is a very bold word, sir.
I've used bolder words before this... and against better adversaries.
[Bag pipe music]
That's not very bad, mr. Stewart,
But you show poor device in your warblers.
Me! I'll give you the lie.
Do you own yourself beaten at the pipes
That you seek to change them for the sword?
Well said, mr. Macgregor.
So i'll appeal to donald.
You need appeal to no one, sir,
For it's the god's truth you're a creditable piper.
For a stewart.
Enough.
You can play the pipes.
Make the most of that.
You're a great piper, robin macgregor.
I'm not fit to play in the same kingdom with you.
A while ago, i could have given you a lesson with my sword,
But no more.
It'd go against my heart
To slice a man up that can play the pipes like you can.
[Laughs]
There it is, the old bridge of stirling.
When we get across that, we can throw our bonnets in the air.
We're away from the highlands.
Ah, to have come this far
And be bocked at the last step.
We could set about him.
And have the whole garrison after us at his first cry.
Could we swim across?
I swim like a stone.
But there are boats.
If i set my mind to it, doubtless i could steal one.
No. If you pass the bridge, you can tell no tales,
But if you leave a boat on the other side,
Somebody must have brought it.
And the whole countryside's in an uproar.
Well, there's nothing else for it.
We'll have to go back the way we came
And creep around the head of the river.
Look.
Well?
Did you not observe?
He didn't even turn his head to see
Whether it was a man or a woman,
Which means they're not on the lookout for us here.
They didn't think we'd be such gulks as to cross
Under the noses of the garrison.
David, it's a chief military principle
To go where you're least expected.
So this is where we cross.
Your very humble and obedient servant, madam.
Have you got a twist of tobacco?
For which i'll give you sixpence.
I'll need something to light it with,
So if you've got a tinderbox,
I'll give you a shilling.
But, madam, i'll need something to smoke it in.
So make it two shillings for your pipe.
May god bless you, madam.
What are those for?
I'll tell you, since you seem so inexperienced
In such matters.
Hunted men are always on the run.
- You'll grant that?
- Aye.
So we must seem to be in no hurry at all.
That's what i want this for.
I'll wander up there, and then light it
As slowly as can be.
You saunter by,
And after a while, i follow.
- [Chatter]
- Look at that.
- [Indistinct chatter]
- At least it's not raining.
Hoot-Toot, twice the redcoats, half the risk.
Now he's got someone to talk to,
Why should he fuss himself over us?
Now, david, keep a cool head.
If you lose your courage and take to your heels,
We're both dead men.
And what a time i had.
Didn't we just?
Five weeks in the punishing mountains
And not a thing to show at the end of it.
Fellow by the name of campbell, wasn't it?
I don't know.
One scotsman's just like another to me.
[Chuckles]
But we were supposed to be there
To guard him, so when he got done in, well,
We had to chase off after the two blokes what done it.
You never nabbed either of 'em, eh?
Nah, and couldn't they run?
Like a pair of blooming rabbits.
Took us over half of scotland they did.
I heard they got a reward out for 'em now.
Yeah, yeah, they have.
100 quid for the big one,
And 50 for the little one.
Bloody hell.
Blimey, what i could do with 150 quid.
Yeah.
Yeah, you know what i'd do?
Yeah, what?
I'd buy myself a nice, little pub
Right in front of the barracks.
[Laughs] i would.
And i'd sit there out in the sun,
Drinking me own beer from noon onward...
[dog barks; clopping hooves]
Mr. Rankeillor?
Are you mr. Rankeillor, the lawyer?
I am, but i do not know your name nor yet your face.
My name is david balfour, sir.
And i believe i have some rights on the estate of shaws.
David balfour.
And where did you come from, mr. David balfour?
From many strange places, sir.
'Tis six weeks since i started for that door,
But i was kidnapped on the way
By someone who did not want me to reach it.
And who was this villainous person, mr. Balfour?
Someone whom i think you know, sir-
My uncle ebenezer.
Pray come inside.
No, mr. David, your uncle did not steal
The house of shaws.
It came to him in a much more singular way
As the result of a love affair.
- A love affair?
- Yes, mr. David.
Your uncle was not always old,
And, what may surprise you more, not always ugly.
So when he and your father fell in love
With the same young lady,
Oh, he made mighty certain of the victory.
But when instead the young lady chose your father,
He screeched like a peacock.
Well, mr. David, the end of it was
That they came to a sort of bargain.
Your father took the lady, who became your mother,
But he left your uncle ebenezer with the estate.
They talk a lot about generosity,
But i often think the happiest consequences flow
When a gentleman consults his lawyer.
Certainly, your father's hasty decision brought no joy at all
To your uncle ebenezer, as you've seen for yourself.
I have indeed, sir.
Money was all he got out of his bargain.
And he came to think the more of money.
He was selfish when he was young.
He's selfish now he's old.
And the latter end to all this selfishness you know yourself.
Yes, sir, but in all this, what is my position?
Oh, the estate's yours.
Beyond a doubt, your father might give up his own rights.
He couldn't sign away yours.
So the day he died,
You became the laird of shaws.
However, getting possession-
Quite another question.
A lawsuit is expensive,
And a family lawsuit is always scandalous.
But what possible answer could my uncle have?
Well, he would begin, no doubt,
By denying you were his nephew.
How could he?
He as much as admitted it by having me kidnapped.
Very true.
How are we to prove that he had you kidnapped?
Mr. Rankeillor, i do not intend
To haul down my colors and leave my uncle
A fortune that isn't his.
Quite so.
So the only thing to do
Is to make him admit the kidnapping
In front of witnesses.
And just how are you gonna manage that?
Oh, i could not manage it,
And i do not think that even you could,
For it needs a violent man without too much concern
For what is proper and correct.
And for that, sir, i think i know just the man we need.
[Window screeches open]
Well?
[Chuckles]
Have a care with that blunderbuss.
They're nasty things to burst.
Who are ye, and what brings you here?
What brings me here is more your affair than mine.
And if you're sure it's what you'd like,
I'll set it to a tune and sing it to you.
Well, what is it?
David.
I'm thinking i had better let ye in.
I dare say that, but the point is, would i go in?
And i'll tell you what i'm thinking.
I'm thinking it's here upon this doorstep
That we must confer upon this business.
And it shall be here or nowhere at all,
For i'll have you to understand that i'm as stiff-Necked
As yourself, and a gentleman of better family.
Oh, well,
What must be must be.
One step nearer, and you're as good as dead.
A very civil greeting, to be sure.
This is a very chancy kind of a proceeding,
And i'm bound to be prepared.
And now that we understand one another,
You can name your business.
Well, you that are a man of understanding
Will doubtless have perceived that i am a highland gentleman.
My name has no business in my story.
But the country of my friends
Is not very far from the torran rocks.
Well, it seems that there was a ship that went aground there.
A gentleman of my family came upon a lad
That was half-Drowned.
He brought him to, and he and some other gentlemen
Clapped him in an old, ruined castle where,
From that day to this, he's been a great expense to my friends.
Now they, not being so particular about the law
As some i could name,
In finding out the lad owns some decent folk,
Asked me to give you a call and confer upon the matter.
And i can tell you this from the start-
That unless we can agree on some terms,
You're not likely to set eyes on the lad again.
For my friends are not very well off.
I'm not very caring.
He was never a good lad at the best of it,
And i have no call to interfere.
Oh, come on, you wouldn't desert your brother's son.
It wouldn't make you very popular in the countryside.
I'm not just very popular the way it is,
So that's idle talk, my buckie.
[Laughs]
Mr. Balfour, we thought you liked david,
Would pay to get him back.
But it seems that's not the case.
And i'm thinking you've very good reasons
For not wanting him back,
And, instead, you'll pay us to keep him.
That'll put as pretty a penny in our pocket as the other.
I do not follow you there.
Now see here,
You don't want the lad back,
What do you want done with him
And how much will you pay?
Come, sir.
I'm a highland gentleman,
Not a sniveling beggar to kick my heels at your hall door.
Either give me an answer in civility,
Or i'll run three feet of steel in your vitals!
Hey, sir, give me a minute.
I'm trying to be as civil as it's morally possible.
Just tell me what you'll be wanting,
And we'll agree fine.
In two words--Do you want the lad killed or kept?
Oh, kept, kept.
Have no bloodshed, if you please.
That'll be the dearer.
The dearer?
What for the dearer?
Killing is easier and quicker.
To keep the lad will be a troublesome business.
I'll have him kept, though.
I'm a man of principle.
And if i have to pay for it, i'll pay for it.
Ah.
What about the price?
Of course, i'll have to ken first
What you paid captain hoseason.
Captain hoseason?
What for?
- For kidnapping the boy.
- It's a lie!
It's a black lie.
He never was kidnapped.
He lied in his throat that told you that.
Hoseason wouldn't like to hear you say so.
What do you mean?
Was it hoseason that told ye?
How else you think i ken, you stupid, old runt?
Oh, hoseason and i are partners.
We gang shares.
But i'm bound to say you struck a fool's bargain
When you let a man like that sail a man so far forward
In your private affairs.
The point in hand is this-
How much did you pay him?
How much does he say i paid him?
That's my concern.
Well, i do not doubt that he lied.
I don't care what he said.
I tell you that he lied.
And the solemn god's truth is this-
I paid him no more than 20 pounds.
- You paid him 20 pounds?
- Aye.
- To kidnap the lad?
- I swear it.
20 pounds.
Mind ye, i'll be perfectly frank with you.
He was to have the selling of the lad in carolina,
Which would be 20 pounds more,
But not out of my pocket, you see.
Thank you, mr. Stewart.
I think we have just what we need.
Good evening, uncle.
It's a fine night, isn't it?
David, is that you, man?
Yes, it's me, uncle.
Then i have wasted my 20 pounds.
It's a braw new suit, mr. Balfour of shaws.
I don't have just the hang of it yet.
You're none too early, davie.
The tide's on the turn.
I'm waiting for a signal to go aboard.
So you have a ship.
There she is.
The captain's the right party.
I'll be in france within the week.
How about you?
It's all settled and sealed.
[Laughs] to think of it, davie,
Only a week ago, you lay under heaven with an empty belly
And in fear of death.
And now you're the laird of shaws.
I suppose so.
You don't seem very joyful about it.
I'll get used to it.
[Cannon shot]
There's the signal.
- When will you be back?
- [Chuckles]
The highlands will be no safe place
For alan breck for a while.
But, later on, when the noise dies down,
You'll come away one day behind a heather bush
Or watching you from the wood about you.
Well, good-Bye.
Good-Bye, alan breck.
{275}{358}About two thousand years ago|in the time of Cleopatra, queen of Egypt...
{361}{463}The Egyptians talked like this:
{1388}{1468}This language was rather|difficult to understand.
{1471}{1566}So the film you are about to see has|been dubbed into English. However ...
{1569}{1663}due to the fact that dubbing techniques|had not been perfected in this period ...
{1666}{1765}you may notice that the movement of|lips is not always synchronised exactly ...
{1767}{1866}with the words being spoken.
{1873}{2021}And now after this|interesting and instructive prologue, ...
{8782}{8881}...and as for the saying that we Egyptians,|who are the descended from the great...
{8883}{8984}Gods, have built things proudly...|Well it's a disgrace, it's a shame, ...
{8986}{9110}it's absurd, ridiculous and its just|plain silly and there's nothing else ...
{9113}{9261}to add unless it's to say that your|stable is infamous, oh Caesar!
{9275}{9353}But you really do have to face the facts|oh Queen, that Egypt is decadent.
{9362}{9469}My people have built the pyramids, the|tower of Souls and the temples, the Obelix!
{9473}{9612}A long time ago I might add.|- Enough!
{9495}{9594}I Cleopatra, will prove my people aren't|decadent! In exactly three months ...
{9596}{9695}I will have a magnificent palace built|for you, here in Alexandria.
{9705}{9802}Very well then.|If you win your bet I will admit the ...
{9805}{9904}Egyptian people are still powerful.
{9961}{10093}She's a nice girl but her nose is easily|put out of joint, it's a pretty nose too.
{10280}{10367}Edephus! I have summoned you because|you're the best architect in Alexandria, ...
{10370}{10447}not that that is saying very much,|your building crumble.
{10450}{10528}They are the laughing stock for those|that don't live in them.
{10531}{10663}Well you see, actually what I like|to build is pyramids.
{10666}{10753}Silence! you have three months to|make good, you are to build a ...
{10756}{10828}magnificent palace here in|Alexandria for Julius Caesar.
{10833}{10932}What three months?|- If you succeed I'll cover you ...
{10934}{11031}with gold, if not, I will have you|thrown to the crocodiles. Go!
{11034}{11157}Three months! Well I need someone|who can work magic to help me do that.
{11185}{11333}A magician, oh I got it,|I know the very man!
{12090}{12196}I'm training him to carry the menhirs|- In the meantime what about a boar?
{12764}{12885}Where do I find the Druid, Getafix?|- Up that tree, under the mistletoe.
{12892}{12989}Getafix!
{13005}{13102}What a pleasant surprise!
{13290}{13410}Meet my dear old friend Edephus, he's an|Architect from Alexandria.
{13449}{13579}Well I've been told to build a palace|for Caesar within three months, and ...
{13582}{13712}if I don't, Cleopatra will throw me|to the crocodiles.
{13715}{13791}Are crocodiles good to eat Asterix?|- Be quiet!
{13794}{13907}And if you won't help me,|I'll never get it done.
{13910}{14028}Now you mustn't cry Edephus,|I'm coming back to Egypt with you.
{14126}{14196}By yourself? Do you mean it?
{14200}{14274}We're off on a long sea voyage Dogmatix.|- You're not going to take him along!
{14276}{14353}Why not mister Asterix?|- Because he's far too small for such ...
{14356}{14440}a long journey Mr. Obelix,|so you go and pack.
{14444}{14570}Oh sure, I'm just an extra to fill in,|non one ever listens to me.
{14614}{14737}My friends, the best of luck to you and I|hope the sky never falls on your heads.
{14795}{14871}I will now sing a for you a|little farewell tune.
{14875}{14948}Oh no!
{15080}{15154}Philistine!
{15461}{15566}That was me barking, woof woof.|Can't I even bark now?
{15573}{15670}All right you idiot, let Dogmatix|out of the bag.
{15986}{16109}Weight anchor now, send the bags up|- Hoist the bags up
{16381}{16504}In Egypt we'll have to contend|with a lot of difficulties and ...
{16507}{16606}there's always the danger|of meeting pirates.
{16619}{16705}We'll look after the pirates, won't we?|- Oh sure.
{16736}{16810}Ship to starboard!
{16944}{17062}The pirates! The pirates!
{17419}{17567}Yoohoo, yoohoo wait for us|we are coming, yoohoo!
{17786}{17909}Right then me hearties, don't loose your|nerve. We'll comer them, we'll cut ...
{17912}{18035}their throats, we'll have their guts, we|will throw them in, sink the lot of them.
{18083}{18191}Same old drill as usual, wait till a I|give the word then board them.
{18194}{18342}Come on board them!|- Did you say board us?
{18980}{19041}I'll be right with you.
{19209}{19279}I hope I didn't keep you waiting.
{19310}{19358}That's not fair.
{19362}{19410}Did you say board us?
{19732}{19786}Did you say board us?
{20155}{20202}Obelix, come on.
{20337}{20411}Come on let's go.|- Right Asterix, but there's still one ...
{20414}{20562}pirate left up there!|- No, no!
{20739}{20862}You say board us?|-Same old drill as usual boy!
{20957}{21056}And one fine night after a long calm|voyage, unbroken by further incident ...
{21058}{21181}the ship approaches the end|of its peaceful voyage.
{21213}{21286}What's that light on the horizon?
{21292}{21389}That's the tower of Pharaoh, it guides|ship into the harbour, ...
{21391}{21453}we'll be in Alexandria tomorrow.
{21459}{21570}A tower for guiding ships in?|They're crazy these Egyptians.
{22228}{22353}Cleopatra' s bath!|- Queen Cleopatra's bath!
{22405}{22478}Queen Cleopatra's bath!
{22924}{23062}Bring Cleopatra's soap!|- Bring Cleopatra's soap!
{23065}{23177}Bring Cleopatra's soap!
{23760}{23894}Bring Cleopatra's lion!|- Bring Cleopatra's lion!
{23897}{23952}Bring Cleopatra's lion!
{26678}{26801}Oh my Queen, this are my friends from|Gaul, a powerful magician and ...
{26804}{26907}two brave warriors, who have|come to help me in my task.
{26911}{26971}Well get going, you really|don't have much time.
{27027}{27170}If you succeed there will be gold for all,|if not you'll be thrown to the crocodiles.
{27175}{27274}And by the way, I warn you that your rival|Ardefus isn't please that I chose you ...
{27276}{27386}and not him to build the palace and he's|jealous. If you want to know what I think ...
{27389}{27481}he'd love to see you wind up inside...|- A Crocodile
{27486}{27552}That is right. Now go!
{27557}{27646}She's bad tempered but what a pretty nose.|- Yes very pretty.
{27651}{27721}Now I'll take you to my place.
{27783}{27906}That's my work there.|I designed that one too.
{27942}{28025}And that is another one of mine.
{28189}{28263}That was one mine too.
{28330}{28408}And this is my house.|- I might have guessed it.
{28630}{28766}The door is jammed, it's the dampness.|- I'll just give you a little hand.
{28770}{28816}No Obelix!
{28887}{28953}Oh don't scold him the|wood is still too dry.
{29005}{29079}Welcome to my house.
{29438}{29512}Come this way please.
{29514}{29573}Coming Obelix.
{30223}{30271}And this is where I work.
{30321}{30440}Master, the architect Ardefus|demand to see you.
{30444}{30567}My rival, show him in.|- I'll come straight to the point, ...
{30570}{30693}let us build Caesar's palace together.|If we succeed then we divide the gold ...
{30696}{30844}between us, if not, you can be food for|the crocodiles by yourself, after all ...
{30847}{30995}there wouldn't be any need to give|them two when one will do nicely.
{30998}{31121}I refuse, you are a cruel, two-faced|schemer that's what you are.
{31127}{31275}Now get out of my home!|-You'll be sorry for this, you wait, ...
{31279}{31427}and I'll see you later in an alligator!
{31790}{31879}I'll take you to the building site.|- Yes do Edephus, It should be ...
{31882}{31956}interesting to see where you work.
{31962}{32026}Dogmatix!
{33036}{33148}Are they slaves?|- Oh no, those are free workers.
{33152}{33220}They are crazy these Egyptians.
{33824}{33921}This is lunch hour, come and see the|plans for the palace.
{33924}{33996}Why aren't those two stopping?|- They are getting a little overtime.
{34065}{34211}Here are the plans, I designed them.|- I recognise your style.
{34620}{34743}Good people, don't let that wretched|architect Edephus exploit you.
{34746}{34869}You have eaten too much and|you are paid too little, stop work now!
{34872}{34995}Take action against such as|exploiter, leave him in the lurch.
{34998}{35099}Go on strike, go back home!
{35708}{35818}Master the workers have just told me|that they refuse to do any more work.
{35821}{35910}Someone is stirring them up against me.|- But who?
{35913}{35996}Yes, who?|- Ardefus, your rival of course.
{35999}{36146}All this worry makes me feel ill, when the|crocodiles get me, I'll be uneatable!
{36149}{36299}You're eager to make them a good meal.|- Of course, they are sacred crocodiles!
{36299}{36361}After all, they are crazy,|these architects!
{36365}{36464}Let's see what is going on.
{36487}{36569}We refuse to go on working under|this condition, the work is too hard.
{36574}{36629}Right!
{36640}{36786}They don't want to go on working.
{36791}{36877}The work is too hard.
{36884}{36985}Asterix light me a good fire|under that cauldron.
{37241}{37387}No, not for you. You fell in the potion|when you were a baby.
{37391}{37482}Give them a little|demonstration Asterix.
{38285}{38408}It works like a charm.|- Of course, bring your men along, ...
{38411}{38528}a little portion of this magic potion|will do the trick.
{38829}{38902}No!
{39079}{39152}No!
{39225}{39298}No!
{39434}{39538}No!|- How does he manage to recognise me?
{41063}{41186}I must do something and fast. Crewcut!
{41191}{41323}Yes, oh Ardefus my master|- I know that Edephus's expecting stone ...
{41325}{41473}to come down the Nile from the south,|that stone must never arrive.
{41480}{41567}Here is gold, Crewcut for you|to settle this business.
{41574}{41675}I hear you and obey you and|Ardefus my master.
{41937}{42077}Take this gold and make sure that the|stone doesn't reach its destination.
{42081}{42182}Done by Osiris.|Thrown this stones overboard.
{43073}{43188}There's non stone left.|- This is Ardefus's doing.
{43205}{43328}No more stone, no palace,|no palace, the crocodiles!
{43336}{43397}Calm down, we'll get your stone for you.
{43401}{43477}Don't worry, we'll get it back|as soon as we can.
{43481}{43574}I hope, but we've only a month's|time left to finish the palace.
{43578}{43716}They must never come back from their|journey alive. I'm counting on you.
{43721}{43791}They won't ever arrive, oh master.
{43875}{43948}{Y:i}This is slow, too slow
{43959}{44036}Move all the ships to the back and|fasten them together with rope.
{44040}{44092}That's what I like, a little exercise.
{44335}{44416}I must say the boy never|fails to surprise me.
{44873}{44996}There's no much beer or boars here.|- You have to eat what is put before you.
{45143}{45266}Beer for Asterix!
{45839}{45938}Boars and beer for Obelix!
{46697}{46796}Bones for Dogmatix!
{49736}{49859}Look here, I've got one hump,|I'm a dromedary, not a camel!
{49862}{49966}Honest I ask you!
{50679}{50828}Tomorrow we shall go and see the Sphinx|and the pyramids, they are worth a visit.
{50897}{50945}What do you think of that?
{51050}{51198}Dogmatix, Dogmatix, come here!|Come here Dogmatix!
{51205}{51294}Dogmatix, you leave her alone Dogmatix!
{51450}{51549}There must be a great view|from up there
{51565}{51626}Dogmatix, you wait here.
{51917}{51992}Obelix!|- Oh dear! Oh dear! Oh dear!
{52155}{52226}We'd better get out of here, come on.
{52878}{53017}From the top of these pyramids here,|twenty centuries look down on you.
{53137}{53244}There must be a great view from up there.|- Obelix you stay here.
{53247}{53357}Oh pyramids, give me a menhir any day.|- Can't you forget Stonehenge?
{53364}{53490}I wonder if they would let us visit them.|- Yes of course, of course, I'm a guide ...
{53500}{53648}and I can take you noble foreigner|tourist for a visit inside the pyramids.
{53682}{53755}In that case we accept with pleasure.
{53810}{53888}Follow the guide.
{53901}{54000}This is no place for a nice little dog,|wait for me here, Dogmatix, ...
{54005}{54125}and if you're good|you'll get a nice bone.
{54428}{54520}Absolutely fascinating, these pyramids.
{55048}{55147}Dark blue sky told me, noble strangers,|without me you would never get out ...
{55149}{55275}of this labyrinth alive.
{55338}{55486}Come along in here, this room boasts|some magnificent hieroglyphics.
{55566}{55689}You will never get out of here|noble strangers.
{55692}{55811}This room will be you tomb.
{55913}{56012}Very interesting these old carvings.|- Yes, but our first concern is to find ...
{56014}{56068}our way out of here.
{56071}{56135}Non of this would never|have happened inside a menhir.
{56139}{56262}All things considered, Obelix for the|very first time, I'm going to give you ...
{56265}{56413}some of the magic potion.
{56491}{56639}Honest? I'm going to have some magic|potion! La la la!
{56883}{57031}I'm glad I came inside this pyramid.|- Obelix, after you.
{57083}{57156}Can I have a little bit more?
{57429}{57477}Well are you coming?
{57614}{57737}Very interesting, these mazes.
{57786}{57872}How about that door there?|- Can I have a little bit more?
{57876}{57975}No Obelix! No!|- It's just isn't fair! I hardly had time
{57977}{58076}to taste it and now he won't give me|any more, it's not fair!
{58325}{58412}I'm afraid that guide was right, it's|just possible we won't get out alive.
{58498}{58607}I'm sorry for poor Edephus, without us|he won't have his palace finished in time.
{58611}{58734}{Y:i}I'm sorry for Dogmatix that's outside!|- Dogmatix!
{58813}{58952}Dogmatix has tracked us down here thanks|to his nose, so he can find the way out.
{59033}{59114}You'll get two big bones.
{59322}{59395}You'll get lots and lots of bones.
{59519}{59621}Sometimes I think he understands|everything I say to him.
{59625}{59658}Follow the guide.
{60084}{60207}It's magic! You're all wizards.
{60461}{60584}It's magic, they're all magician, they|managed to get out of the Great Pyramid.
{60623}{60722}Those Gauls are really fantastic,|even so they still haven't reached ...
{60724}{60823}Alexandria, they still have to get back|up the Nile, we must stop them somehow.
{60928}{61051}I know just the men you need master.|It's a bold gang of pirates who lost ...
{61054}{61153}their ship on high seas|when they got on the wrong tack.
{61156}{61253}Send them to me.|- They are here master!
{61316}{61439}I'll give you a boat and you will sail|this boat down the Nile. Somewhere ...
{61442}{61565}you'll meet a fleet of ships carrying,|stone if those ships fail to reach ...
{61568}{61716}Alexandria, you will get gold,|lots of gold! Now look you, you board ...
{61723}{61871}them, cut their throats, have their guts|you do them in and then sink them.
{61893}{62006}Same old drill as usual boy.
{62254}{62391}These cruises are such a bore.|I'm bored Asterix!
{62469}{62553}I have the impression that there's|going to be some fun soon, Obelix.
{62557}{62669}There's a fleet of ships carrying|stone dead head.
{62674}{62756}Right then me hearties,|don't loose your nerve.
{62759}{62840}It's full of Gauls! Full of Gauls!
{62842}{62970}Full of Gauls? Full speed astern|let's get out of here, about turn!
{63063}{63162}Obelix, here's something to help you|pass the time, there are pirates up head.
{63167}{63266}Real pirates? Oh goodies, goodies.
{63391}{63521}Yoohoo wait for me!
{63525}{63648}Faster boys, faster!
{63996}{64078}Well I think we can get on|with our journey now Obelix.
{64082}{64203}Ah a bite, I'm not eating that fish.
{64382}{64523}Well, we are on the wrong tack again.
{64537}{64646}You know they are beginning to get me|down a little those Gauls.
{64680}{64828}Very well, if that's how it is,|I have an idea, a great idea.
{64832}{64980}You have an idea master?|- Right, a piece of cake, follow me.
{65204}{65352}Pestilential pastry. poisonous pancake.
{65355}{65416}Yes!|-Murderous bangers!
{65420}{65475}Not bad.|- Viper's venom topped with cream
{65478}{65550}Good!|- Cyanide custard pie.
{65553}{65652}Great!|- Special ice arsenic.
{65654}{65720}Oh yes!
{68829}{68943}A present for you oh Queen!|- Bring it in.
{69077}{69186}The three Gauls sent this cake as a gift|to the Queen of the Queens.
{69190}{69335}How sweet of them, you may thank them|in the name of Cleopatra.
{69342}{69393}My taster, send for my taster.
{69396}{69460}Coming! Coming!
{69467}{69577}Taste, tester.|- With pleasure my Queen.
{69716}{69864}Oh dear! Oh dear! Oh dear!
{69902}{69976}Finally my friends,|you are back at last.
{69987}{70088}And we bought you plenty of stone|enough for you to finish the palace.
{70106}{70180}Gauls, I arrest you|in the name of the Queen!
{70184}{70283}Shall I smash them one?|- No, Obelix you can't, let us see ...
{70285}{70345}what is going to happen next.
{70373}{70489}Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear.
{70501}{70591}Gauls you were trying to poison me|with that cake, weren't you?
{70594}{70666}Cake? What cake Queen?|- Throw them into the dungeon ...
{70669}{70737}until I have decided on their fate.
{70767}{70890}There's not a moment to loose,|lets drink this antidote.
{70907}{71006}This potion will neutralise|the effects of the poison.
{71011}{71145}They are just giving the royal|crocodiles their appetisers.
{71148}{71232}Step aside, we are coming out!
{71829}{71932}May we come in?|- Guards, guards seize those three men.
{71985}{72133}Gauls from far, sworn to destroy my power,|I shall show you how a Queen can die.
{72136}{72284}Now is the fatal hour, see how a Queen|can die, here I come, Osiris!
{72302}{72352}Gosh, she's a good actress.
{72356}{72435}No, no, calm down, we simply want to|know what we're being charged with?
{72439}{72509}What you're charged with? With that!
{72512}{72652}Looks like a very good cake.|- Obelix, will you find me a cake knife?
{72667}{72790}May I?|Now cut three pieces of this cake.
{72957}{73008}Three pieces I said!
{73012}{73103}That's right, three!|- Greedy pig!
{73283}{73407}I call that an excellent cake, my Queen,|what was so special about it?
{73413}{73537}Just ask my taster.|- Oh dear! Oh dear! Oh dear!
{73547}{73695}Ah lets see, he's just got a little touch|of indigestion, that's all it is.
{73786}{73934}Oh dear! Oh dear! Oh dear!|That's much better I'm hungry!
{73940}{74063}I've treated you unjustly, Oh Gauls,|I will set you all free, you may go!
{74070}{74169}Someone must have|wanted to hurt us.
{74171}{74237}Yes but who?|- Ardefus.
{74241}{74302}You mean Edephus's rival?|- Who else?
{74305}{74394}Suppose we pay him a little visit.|- That's just what I was going to suggest.
{74427}{74504}Where does Ardefus live please?|- Ardefus? That way!
{74511}{74600}Here is to our victory Crewcut.
{74603}{74696}The time has come for us to drink|to success.
{76147}{76295}Since you wanted to work on the palace,|we are going to give you your chance.
{76482}{76610}The construction of the palace is going|well, You will have it finished on time.
{76621}{76680}Cleopatra is going to be very pleased.
{76684}{76781}Very pleased. The palace is nearly built|Caesar and you know I think I'm ...
{76784}{76844}going to win that bet Julius.
{76847}{76927}Delighted to hear it, oh my Queen,|simply delighted.
{76980}{77103}I'm shall loose face with Cleopatra.|i was told that her architect Edephus ...
{77106}{77209}was only a nit wit, something odd|is going on here, go and find my spy.
{77311}{77398}Here I am. Here I am.|- Come nearer.
{77402}{77485}Go and see what's going on in|Edephus building site.
{77488}{77583}I want to know why the work|is getting on so fast.
{77592}{77722}Quite a job, hey.
{79197}{79322}Three Gauls? An old druid,|a cunning little one and a fat oaf?
{79328}{79476}Asterix, Obelix and Getafix, those three|men can perform any kind of miracle.
{79487}{79561}I must act now!
{79565}{79674}Send for my Egyptian|mercenaries and quick!
{79757}{79905}Hail Caesar, those that are to serve you|at reduced rates, salute you.
{79951}{80091}You 're to get onto Edephus's building|site, without anyone seeing. Then you ...
{80095}{80243}are to knock over the cauldron of magic|potion, and you're to get hold of that ...
{80246}{80388}Gaulish druid, a bag of gold if you are|successful. Get moving, by Jupiter!
{80392}{80540}We are moving oh Caesar, by Osiris.
{80953}{81061}I'll see about that cauldron, you two|take care of the druid.
{81071}{81154}We get it brother!|- Okay brother!
{81265}{81413}If that potion is all that it's supposed to|be, I won't be sharing that bag of gold.
{82015}{82133}Hey look at that, who are you and where|is our druid Getafix gone?
{82233}{82328}Julius Caesar sent us to capture your|famous druid.
{82335}{82444}But our big brother has double-crossed|us to get all the reward for himself.
{82449}{82597}Without the magic potion, without Getafix|we are lost, the sacred crocodiles will...
{82620}{82754}Lets go and get our druids back.|- All right Asterix.
{82809}{82935}Dogmatix I'm leaving you here to|guard the building site, watch out.
{83077}{83195}One of the mercenaries is back, Caesar!|- Send him in.
{83214}{83292}Mission accomplished oh Caesar!
{83295}{83441}You have deserved well Caesar mercenary|here is the reward I promised you.
{83445}{83575}Have this troublesome druid locked up,|I want him thrown into the dungeon.
{83617}{83765}I'm the hottest, I'm the|richest, I'm the...
{83837}{83920}Where is our druid?|- Caesar has had him shut up in the ...
{83923}{83997}dungeon of the palace, please don't|beat me anymore.
{84074}{84138}Coming Obelix.|- Yes Asterix.
{84167}{84315}It's big brother. Big brother, junior|and I want a word with you.
{84371}{84453}I only hope we'll be able to find our|poor old druid.
{84457}{84591}All these old dungeons are the same.|It's just as easy to get in as it is to get out.
{84604}{84684}Halt, you can't come in.|- So we can.
{84687}{84810}May I Obelix, if you don't mind.
{84945}{85018}Asterix, Obelix!
{85112}{85211}Step aside, we're coming out.|- Oh no, you're not coming out.
{85213}{85282}- Oh yes we are.
{85417}{85510}You meant, you're coming out.
{86043}{86166}What? The druid have escaped from|prison? Those Gauls will soon find out ...
{86169}{86292}what it means to brave Caesar' anger!|Tomorrow when they waken I will have ...
{86319}{86467}a little surprise waiting for them,|and I think you will like it!
{87056}{87182}Master, the building site is deserted,|none of the workers have come to work.
{87189}{87301}What's going on? What's happened now?
{87475}{87598}In the name of Caesar, we hear some|Gaulish troublemaker are hiding on this...
{87601}{87734}building site. we order them to surrender,|if they don't we shall attack, by Jupiter!
{87739}{87876}We don't want to fight, but if we have|t o, we've got the men and the stones!
{87880}{87934}You'll be sorry for this. By Mercury!
{87938}{88070}What are we going to do, by ourselves?|- We build our fortifications by Felenos.
{88074}{88148}You're quite right, my ben salaam.
{88152}{88249}Do you think we might go home now|by any job?
{89530}{89578}To the attack!
{90358}{90474}Return to the battle!|- Join the army, re-enlist the masses.
{90478}{90601}They are back again!
{91251}{91308}To the attack!
{91311}{91394}See the world, the man said.
{91741}{91820}To the attack!|- He's nut!
{91823}{91878}You're off your head!|- No kidding.
{91881}{91978}If that's the way it's going to be,|we'll have to bombard them.
{92276}{92412}Hey look, they've got guided missiles.|If they miss I'll be surprised.
{92415}{92463}Fire!
{92734}{92850}My palace! They are|breaking up my palace!
{92853}{92976}We ought to let Cleopatra know,|she is the only one who can get ...
{92979}{93078}Caesar to stop this attack!|- Good idea, I'll write Her a letter.
{93102}{93226}And Dogmatix will deliver it for you.|Dogmatix? But he's much too small.
{93229}{93326}Dogmatix is not too small.|- Obelix don't be pig headed, ...
{93329}{93419}Dogmatix can not deliver that message.|- Yes he can! Mr. Asterix does ...
{93422}{93477}everything, Mr. Asterix|has to be the boss!
{93480}{93528}You know what Mr. Asterix has to say?
{93531}{93630}No just what does Mr. Asterix has to say?|- Here is the message, but how are ...
{93634}{93731}we going to get it to Cleopatra?|We are being besieged.
{93737}{93824}Oh you had better ask|Mr. Asterix, he's boss.
{93831}{93932}Now, now Obelix, don't be cross|I was only teasing.
{93934}{93969}My dog is no good.
{93972}{94059}Dogmatix will deliver the message,|and I'll deliver Dogmatix.
{94070}{94157}Watch out, one of the Gauls|is breaking out.
{94342}{94435}He went the same way he came.|- He was only passing through.
{94821}{94944}Oh Gauls from a far, sworn to destroy|my power, I will show you how ...
{94947}{95020}a Queen...can die, now is the great love...
{95023}{95146}No, no, my dog has brought|a message for you.
{95184}{95258}Oh isn't he sweet? Someone bring a|bone for the dear little dog.
{95274}{95393}This will never do. By Osiris,|Julius Caesar isn't play fair.
{95396}{95491}Right oh Gaul, I will take care of this.
{95495}{95592}Watch out! One of Gaul is breaking in.
{95729}{95832}There you go Obelix, Dogmatix is back.|He carried out his mission perfectly!
{95834}{95892}Oh you see, I was right?
{96012}{96100}Let's hope Cleopatra acts quickly, those|Romans meddlers are demolishing ...
{96103}{96167}the whole palace!
{96169}{96262}You see Caesar, even if we don't capture|those three Gauls, it comes to the ...
{96265}{96360}same thing, the whole palace|will be destroyed.
{96363}{96420}Good excellent!
{96423}{96512}Hail Caesar, there is someone who wants|a word with you, there.
{96959}{97082}Oh my Queen, what a happy chance.|-That will do! When I heard what was...
{97085}{97184}happening I hurried out at once.|I didn't even stop to change my dress.
{97187}{97305}When you make a bet you're supposed|to play it fair and I had every right to...
{97309}{97412}call the Gauls, and I'll prove to you that|my Egyptians can still build a beautiful...
{97414}{97539}palaces, and I insist that the Roman leave|the builders alone and let me tell you...
{97543}{97691}Yes, yes, all right I apologise.|- Well I should hope so, let's go home.
{98007}{98130}Well, what do we do now Caesar?|- We lift the siege, you idiot.
{98663}{98789}Look, the Romans are lifting the siege!|- Victory by Tutatis!
{98793}{98872}Goodies, goodies!|- And it's all thanks to Dogmatix!
{98876}{98924}Now then, back to work.
{98987}{99086}Sure enough the work gets going|again and at considerable speed, ...
{99088}{99180}since you will remember when architects|did not finish the job on time ...
{99183}{99306}they were thrown to the crocodiles, a|good old custom sadly neglected today.
{99309}{99382}At last one fine morning...
{99402}{99510}Oh my Queen the palace is ready for you!|- You have kept you word Edephus, ...
{99513}{99633}I Cleopatra will keep mine.|By Osiris cover him with gold!
{100330}{100478}Oh My Queen! The loveliest of Queens!|I have lost my bet and now I yield
{100484}{100558}the victory to you, yours is the honour|of cutting this ribbon Cleopatra.
{100893}{101016}I know how much i owe you Gauls,|and you have earned my heart felt ...
{101019}{101136}gratitude, I will have you sent home|to Gauls on my own state galley.
{101141}{101220}It was nothing Cleopatra,|it was nothing, goodbye now.
{101226}{101294}Say, will there be any boars|on this galley of yours?
{101297}{101383}Obelix!|- Why does he have to keep ...
{101386}{101485}telling me off all the time? This state|galleys might be all very but if there ...
{101487}{101540}aren't any boars it's hardly worth|making all fuss over!
{101889}{102012}Everyone is eating, everyone is|drinking, everyone is joyful and ...
{102015}{102138}celebrating and the happy ending|of this story.
{102104}{102208}Everyone is drinking? Everyone is eating?|Everyone?
{102214}{102274}Well, nearly everyone.
{102544}{102667}And when spring comes ...
{102671}{102787}Cleopatra's magnificent ship approches|the coast of Gauls where the little village...
{102790}{102913}welcomes its heroes with its usual|enthusiasm and feasting.
Thank you.
Tonight, we celebrate with dancing and wine.
Then I'll ready my boat.
And between breakfast and readying your boat...
...I want you to kill everyone on Blefuscu.
But Lilliput is safe.
- I said, kill them!
- We've won. Isn't that enough?
Then force them to open their eggs at the little end.
No, I will not degrade anyone.
We don't need vengeance.
I need it!
On to the banquet.
How dare that man disobey you!
He didn't disobey.
His Majesty didn't insist.
I never had to insist before.
It's unheard of.
- Disgraceful.
- Humiliating.
I'm never humiliated.
But it was disgraceful.
- He won the war.
- He shamed the army and navy.
What's war without death?
Where's the sacrifice beyond the call of duty? The heroism?
I move the prime minister suggest a way...
...to dispose of this freak.
Well, Reldresal?
If we kill him, there would be a danger of an epidemic.
- The navy could float him out to sea.
- Too big. Cost too much.
I have it!
We'll send him to Blefuscu and have them kill him.
Superb idea, Your Majesty.
That way, he's their problem.
It may not be nice, but it's legal.
What if they decide to use him against us?
Shame! Shame! Shame!
How can you plot against Gulliver?
Now, dear, don't get excited.
Nobody's plotting.
You can't fool me. Criers are out proclaiming your kindness.
That means someone will be executed.
- Gulliver wouldn't do my bidding!
- That's no excuse for killing him!
Listen.
Such a sweet, gentle song...
...for such a big, powerful man.
- But I sing, and much better.
- Be quiet!
If he'd made a fool of you, you wouldn't be swaying like a maiden.
- You'd be spitting nails at him.
- Such vanity. Such vanity!
Nothing he does can offend me.
Fire!
Put out the fire!
Stay where you are. I'll put it out.
The uncouth, vile, filthy, evil, dirty spitting and spewing animal.
As I said, madam. As I said.
Destroy him. He's ruined my dress.
Destroy him!
- Precisely the way we all feel.
- Execute him.
Brilliant!
You're a man of action, Flimnap.
You're accused of treason. Flee!
- The emperor's mad.
- Executioners are coming.
Treason? But I saved Lilliput.
I was even decorated.
You made Galbet jealous. The admiral hates you for scuttling the fleet.
The empress is furious.
You ruined her dignity and her dress.
I stop wars, put out fires, feed people...
...give them hope, peace and prosperity. How can I be a traitor?
Treason, man, treason.
The emperor hates you because you're more important than he is.
Petty ambition, selfish people.
Go to freedom and eggs the way you want them.
- I never eat eggs.
- Neither do I. It's the principle.
You caused trouble, endangered your daughter, to win a point?
You promised the giant would solve our problems.
He will. You're the biggest.
Make everyone open eggs your way.
No one's big enough to stop your bickering.
It poisons everything.
Make them think like you.
That will end bickering and war.
Don't you see?
Then I'd be just like the emperor.
And so would you.
Using my strength to oppress others.
- Treason!
- False pride and vanity.
They destroy everything for lovers.
Elizabeth was right.
The only safety is in being obscure, in being nothing.
- Down with force and power.
- Kill him!
Call the guards!
Please, I need your help.
Halt!
- I must show this to the king.
- See the king's chamberlain.
- Welcome to Brobdingnag.
- Don't be frightened. You're safe.
Is that his name? Gulliver?
Yes, my dear. He belongs to Elizabeth.
She's told us all about him.
Now they're the prized possessions of your king.
I know how highly you value these little people, but I must warn you.
Little people are shrunken people, and shrunken people are dangerous.
Makovan, shrunken people are little and little people are toys.
And no one in the entire land of Brobdingnag has them except me.
Take your Gulliver inside.
He needs food and rest.
And the court tailor will make him new clothes.
You're going to be very rich, my girl.
Very rich.
- What did you say your name was, dear?
- Glumdalclitch.
There you are. That will keep your family happy for years.
I don't wanna sell him.
I brought him because law says:
" Little people should be brought to the palace at once."
That's quite right.
Only the king can own little people.
But he's mine. I found him.
My dear child, I've got a surprise for you. Come along with me.
What do you think of these?
My collection of the tiniest animals in the world.
- They're very nice.
- Nice?
It's the most unusual collection ever.
Come see my favourite.
See this tiny crocodile?
He's the fiercest fighting flesh of his size in captivity. Watch.
See how he snaps at it?
That's why we keep him alone.
He'd kill the others instantly.
Now, as a reward...
...l'll give you any of these animals, except my crocodile.
I don't want any. I want my Gulliver.
Come now, girl. Don't be stubborn.
Your king knows best.
He's a king for grownups. Children don't have a king to protect them.
I'm everybody's king.
You take things from children, like all grownups.
They never ask. They just take.
Why not let her stay here? She'll be an excellent guardian for them.
All right. Then I'll decree...
...that your parents let you live here. See? I'm your king too.
Thank you.
I'll protect them with my life!
I'll show you your room, and we'll get you a lovely new dress.
Pages, bring the castle.
You never saw anything of Pritchard or the crew?
After the Antelope sank,
I washed ashore here.
Let's hope that they were saved too.
I never stopped believing you were alive. Not for a moment.
When I think of what those little people might have done to you!
They were vain and selfish.
You're so right.
Wanting to be important and powerful is meaningless.
Our being together is all the importance we ever needed.
- Wait!
- Are you all right?
It's Glumdalclitch, the little girl who found you.
- How do you do? And thank you.
- You're welcome.
I'm going to sleep now, but if you want anything, just call.
Good night, dear.
Isn't this a beautiful place?
And no mortgage, either.
It's a paradise compared to Wapping.
I don't care where we are as long as we're together and safe.
- You got your strength back fast.
- Giant food agrees with me.
No, don't. We're not married yet.
Elizabeth, open the door.
Elizabeth!
Glumdalclitch, wake up!
- Wake the king. We want to be married.
- Now? But everyone's asleep.
Fetch the king, please.
All right. Stop shouting.
Grownups are silly. And little grownups are sillier than anybody.
Wake up in there! Wake up!
Why arouse everyone?
They want a simple ceremony.
If I have to be up in the middle of the night, so does everybody.
- You forgot your slippers.
- I want to do this and go to sleep.
Don't be so grumpy, dear.
Remember carrying me off by moonlight?
How impetuous you were!
How the fires of passion stirred you!
I wish they'd stir now.
It's cold in these halls.
- Please, Your Majesty.
- Yes, all right.
- Where are they?
- There, King Brob.
Pages, get the fire going.
These stones are cold.
They'll be a delightful couple.
Charming!
Forgive me for disturbing you.
Quite all right.
You sure you know what you're doing?
None of your jokes.
You're making them nervous.
They're supposed to be nervous.
Where's the licence?
Where'd they go, the little lovers?
For shame! Shame on all of you!
Stop this nonsense.
Marry them at once.
You're right, dear.
I'd better marry them at once.
I pronounce you man and wife by the authority vested in me, by me.
Live happily, long life, lots of children, that sort of thing.
He should kiss the bride.
He is, dear.
And now, can we go back to bed?
Wake up. Wake up, sleepyheads.
It's morning.
"On our honeymoon. Be back soon.
Love, Elizabeth and Lemuel Gulliver."
Oh, dear. No!
Darling, if we're gone too long,
Glumdalclitch might get into trouble.
She's a big girl. A very big girl.
She can take care of herself.
No more cares. No more worries.
Not a one. I only have to keep you happy, and I'll work hard to do it.
Work? What for?
- To get money to buy food.
- We get all our food free.
- Then, to pay taxes, at least.
- But there are no taxes on us.
- Then to save money for our family.
- The king will give us money.
Yes, but... I guess so.
I don't have a thing to worry about for the rest of my life.
Gulliver? Elizabeth?
Where are you? Answer me!
Elizabeth, here I am!
Down here!
Glumdalclitch, hurry. Over here.
- There you are. Where's Gulliver?
- Here I am!
Down here.
Down here!
- Don't run away again.
- Thank you for saving me.
- Why did you run away?
- We didn't run away.
When you're grown up... become an adult, you'll understand.
- You could have been killed.
- We won't do it again.
I love you both, but you must do what I say.
You must behave, or the king won't let me stay with you.
I have to take you back right now.
The queen is terribly worried.
You upset the queen.
- You cannot leave without permission.
- Where did you go?
On our honeymoon. Your country is as beautiful as England.
- We won't go out alone again.
- Sensible. She will take care of you.
- I can take care of Elizabeth.
- Good! I like little men with spunk.
There. Let's see the alchemist find a formula to get him out of that.
A clever move, sire.
He'll take your rook if you move there.
- I beg your pardon?
- I shouldn't have interfered.
You play chess?
- Quite often.
- He's very good.
Let's see how good he is.
Take over Makovan's game.
- May I study the board?
- Of course.
I'm ready, Your Majesty.
That's a strange move.
Really? I'd like to know more about him.
- What were you in your little country?
- I was a doctor.
A witchery doctor.
No, Makovan. A bodily doctor.
Baying at the moon or waving a cat won't cure a bladder ailment.
Stop that jabbering. It's my move.
Ridiculous. Impossible.
I can take your...
No, then you could take my...
This isn't a judging game.
You'd better let him win.
You win.
He can't help it if he's a bright man.
It isn't like you to be a bad loser.
He didn't lose. A witch tricked him into making false moves.
But I couldn't have been beaten by such a tiny witch.
Maybe he wasn't always small.
A witch can make himself any size he wants.
Have you seen the way he kisses that woman of his?
Witches aren't interested in that sort of thing.
Precisely.
Do married people kiss so happily?
Always, all the time?
You have a point there, Makovan.
My stomach!
Oh, it hurts!
Makovan, get me some herbs quickly.
They're angry with us.
Teatime's past, and they always invited me.
Is that the price? Loss of dignity?
- Losing the game isn't losing dignity.
- It's pretending to be stupid.
- You could try to humour them.
- I could educate them.
They're backward, they're in the Middle Ages.
Don't change them. That'd spoil everything. We're happy here.
- We can't be when we're nobodies.
- Try to be equal, they'll hate us.
If I don't, they'll laugh.
They laugh enough, they'll get bored.
Then they'll stop laughing.
Since that's all we're here for, they'll get rid of us.
- The queen is ill.
- When? We just left her.
I saw them carry her to her quarters.
- Who's caring for her?
- Makovan.
- She needs a doctor.
- No, please.
- She's healthy. She just eats too much.
- Please wait!
Take me to Makovan's laboratory.
I can't do that. The king won't allow it. It's forbidden.
Do as I say!
It's an evil place filled with Makovan's magic.
- I'll turn his magic into medicine.
- No! You'll be killed.
Don't worry. It's our best chance to live happily ever after forever.
Take me there.
This will soothe you. My special formula made of spirits of theriac.
- It's too hot, you fool!
- It must be hot, Your Majesty.
It's not helping her, Makovan.
Try another formula.
King Brob? Please, King Brob.
Let Dr. Gulliver help her.
What are you doing here?
Go away, child.
Just relax. I'm a physician, a doctor. I'll help you.
I'm dying.
You're not dying.
You merely have an upset stomach.
But it aches so.
I have prepared a solution of laudanum, a paregoric.
- Drink it and you'll feel better.
- Are you sure?
I know it will cure you.
I'm staking my life on it.
As a physician, I wish I could take madam's hand and soothe her.
Yes, doctor.
The medicine is on the table.
Drink it down like a good girl.
Yes, doctor.
She's calling for him.
She's losing her mind.
No, he's going to help her.
He's a doctor.
Help her? That little witch?
Where is he?
- Put it down! No, no!
- Away.
- All of it, madam!
- Yes, doctor.
He's poisoned her.
She needed help on the inside, not the outside.
There he is!
Catch him!
Stop it!
I feel better already.
- Are you sure?
- The pain's completely gone.
You gave me the scare of my life.
All of you leave.
I wish to consult with Gulliver.
You may leave too, dear.
Gulliver will be safe here with me.
I said I'd like a few minutes alone with my physician.
- Your what?
- My doctor.
Dr. Gulliver.
I can care for you.
Get rid of that man.
You didn't save my life. He did.
- I'm your husband.
- I want my doctor.
All right then. I'll take my doctor.
Dr. Makovan, come with me.
I told you he was a witch, sire.
Shall I burn him?
It's not fair to burn a witch without proving it.
Do you want me to burn him, then prove him a witch?
Or shall I prove it, then burn him?
I don't want the queen upset.
That's what I want.
Then I shall prove him first, and then burn him later.
Is that what you wish?
Must I always tell you what to do?
Show a little initiative.
- Can I watch you make him a witch?
- I'm not making him a witch.
- Can I watch you make him a witch?
- I'm not making him a witch.
He is one, I'll just prove it.
Can I watch? Are you going to burn him afterward?
Witches are always burned at midnight, after your bedtime.
- I was told to bring Gulliver.
- Yes. Just put him on the table.
Not with that cat here.
I'd better keep him in my basket.
The thing's a doll!
- You sent for me? Can I be of service?
- Perhaps.
This is my daughter, Shrike.
Darling, this is Glumdalclitch, guardian of this...
He's not a doll! He's my little man.
I'm not big enough to be your father, but I'm old enough.
He's silly looking and squeaks like a mouse.
You're jealous because you don't have one.
Now, girls. You both go outside and play.
King Brob told me never to leave Gulliver.
Out, I said. There'll be honey cakes and milk for you later.
It's all right. We have grownup scientific matters to discuss.
- What substance is that?
- Air, water, fire and earth.
Plus the spirits of alchemy?
- Mercury, sulphur, arsenic.
- You know those?
- Chemists know our debt to magicians.
- You know magic?
They called it magic when trying to change iron into gold.
- We call it chemistry now.
- You know how to make gold from iron?
It's easier to make a silk purse out of a sow's ear.
You can do that?
How did you know?
Stop that! Girls!
Stop that. Stop that, I say!
Easy. Daddy loves his little baby.
There, there.
He'll put you in the tanks! You'll turn blue! Lt'll prove you're a witch.
- He'll kill you.
- Don't worry. I can handle it.
Everyone he says is a witch, they turn blue in those magic waters.
What did you do?
You're not a witch, are you?
No, Glumdalclitch.
There, there, my sweet.
Leave her alone, you bully.
Sit here and watch me turn him blue.
Then can I stay up late and see the fire?
Turn blue? An innocent man?
A shrivelled man who beats the king at chess...
...cures the queen and makes a silk purse from a sow's ear must turn blue.
Climb down into that pan.
That's enough.
Get in the next one.
- Climb out, Gulliver.
- Yes, sir.
He didn't turn blue!
- Incredible!
- Merely a chemical reaction.
This contains lichen, which eats algae.
Anyone stepping into lichen and then into an alkaline, must turn blue.
- But you're red.
- Of course.
I changed the alkaline to acid.
Acid will then turn anything red.
Amazing witchery.
It's still colourless.
It's the same as your experiment.
It will turn you red.
Never!
Gulliver, the cat!
My cat! You've turned her red.
There, there, my sweet.
Daddy didn't do it, the witch did it.
Your hair will turn red!
Sure as science, and I'm not a witch.
It's turning!
It is, Daddy. It's red.
Your hair.
Little witch, you'll make a short but colourful flame.
Where does he get such power? To turn my hair red, to cure the queen?
Where does he get such power? To turn my hair red, to cure the queen?
I say destroy the witch, sire, before he destroys us.
- It wasn't magic!
- He's not a witch!
Invisible spirits. Evil spirits.
You turned Makovan's hair red.
- Only because I know chemistry.
- There's no such thing, or I'd know.
- No one knows it all.
- What he doesn't know, doesn't exist!
Brobdingnaggians are the wisest people in the world.
And I'm their king, understand?
Admit you never beat me at chess.
By fair means, I mean.
If I deny what I know, what I see and what I hear...
...then I deny all knowledge.
- And if the queen gets another ache?
- That has nothing to do with this!
Get that through your little thick head!
Deny anything they want, say anything! Save yourself.
I can't live without you.
Open the cage.
I'm ready to confess everything.
Confess, then.
I confess that the sun goes round the Earth.
I confess that the world is flat.
I confess that there is no such thing as...
...medicine or science.
And it would take a witch to beat me at chess.
It would take a witch.
Now he's more guilty than ever.
There was no medicine, so he cured the queen with nothing.
Only a witch could do that.
We must burn him.
I'm afraid we must. I'm sorry.
You promised I would be spared.
You lied!
You wear an ignorant's fear.
What you don't know, you destroy.
- Burn him!
- No!
Wait. I have a better way to destroy a witch.
Remarkable idea, sire.
There won't even be an ash remaining.
Go back to bed, child.
She must be spared.
She's done nothing.
- They are both alike.
- On with it!
Leave her there for now.
Open the door of the cage.
Dr. Gulliver! Take this!
- That's it! That's it!
- Come on!
Kill him! Get him, get him!
Hit him again!
- Kill him!
- Finish it!
Come on, kill him!
Come on, get him!
See what powers he has? The strength of a dozen his size. Burn him.
Gulliver! Elizabeth!
- After them!
- Come on!
- Don't let them get away!
- Stop them!
They're coming.
Where shall I hide you?
You can't stay here.
Animals will eat you.
You can't do anymore. Save yourself!
Where are they?
Where did you hide them?
I don't know!
Leave the child alone.
They're somewhere here. Find them.
They must be somewhere here.
- We can't let them escape.
- Set light to the brush!
We're going to die here.
If only I'd listened to you!
If only I hadn't tried to make you live my way.
If only I hadn't wanted everything my way.
There, at the stream.
Hurry! Into the basket.
Where are we?
I don't know.
Was it a dream?
As real as anything we think.
But the giants.
What if the giants come back?
They're always with us, the giants and the Lilliputians.
Inside us.
Their terrible world waiting to take our lives...
...waiting for us to make a mistake.
To be selfish again.
How can we bear it?
How can we live with such fear?
With love.
The way Glumdalclitch did.
Glumdalclitch. What happened to her?
She's waiting to be born.
Yes.
We're back in our world!
Pardon me. We're lost.
Perhaps you've heard of our country from a soldier or sailor.
- We come from far-off England.
- A town called Wapping.
Are you barmy? This is England.
And Wapping's just beyond that wood.
Thank you. Thank you, sir.

{3619}{3698}What are you doing with it this time?|Empty that thing and please put...
{3702}{3819}Adam. Adam. Give it to Mommy,|sweetheart. It's a no-no.
{3823}{3891}Adam, don't drop it, sweetheart.|Give it to Mommy.
{3900}{3943}It's a no-no. Give it to Mommy.
{3947}{4003}Adam, don't drop it.
{4132}{4231}That does it. George, Gabriel,|no television for you two tonight.
{4235}{4285}- What did we do?|- You never said anything...
{4289}{4379}...about paper bags out the window.|You just said cherry pits and marbles.
{4383}{4435}Anyway, we didn't drop them.|It was Adam.
{4447}{4527}- I suppose it was Adam's idea.|- Cokey-Cola.
{4533}{4609}Yes, I know, sweetheart,|it wasn't your fault.
{4678}{4797}If they murdered somebody, it'd be the|guy that shot the gun that'd go to jail...
{4801}{4845}...not the one that got the idea.
{4849}{4915}So Adam's the one that shouldn't|get to watch television.
{4919}{4974}I mean, if you wanna be fair.
{4990}{5054}Well, I don't wanna be fair.|What do you think about that?
{5058}{5151}So nobody gets to watch television,|including the attorney for the defense!
{5289}{5391}Just once in my life, I'd like|to get dressed without an audience.
{5395}{5487}Boy, if we made a mess like this|in our room, she'd sure carry on.
{5491}{5604}Listen, when I make a mess, I clean it up.|When you make a mess, I clean it too.
{5668}{5756}- What do you do that for?|- Make my eyelashes longer.
{5760}{5807}What do you want them|to look longer for?
{5811}{5883}Everybody wants them... Fellas, now,|you know I have to meet...
{5887}{5991}David, put that down. I'm very late.|Now, will you please have a heart?
{6022}{6082}Look whose better instincts|I'm appealing to.
{6086}{6116}- Mrs. Mackay.|- Yes?
{6120}{6202}Maybe I ought to feed the kids before|I go, seeing it's a new babysitter.
{6206}{6296}Let her have the pleasure. You better go,|Maggie. It's after 6. After 6? After...?
{6300}{6350}- For heaven's sake.|- See you in the morning.
{6354}{6419}George, this is my last warning.
{6423}{6514}You eat tomatoes in bed once more,|and you scrape the seeds off the sheets.
{6518}{6610}- Oh, Maggie, you always say that.|- I know.
{6621}{6670}- Bye.|- I'll get it!
{6683}{6737}I'll get it. I said, I'll get it.
{6741}{6846}Hello. Oh, hi, Mother. Mother, I can't talk.|I'm dressing to meet Larry.
{6850}{6938}What? Mother... Mother,|why did you promise?
{6942}{7022}Now, you know Larry only gets|two tickets for openings.
{7026}{7099}Mother, critics don't ask producers|for favors.
{7103}{7167}What if producers asked for favors back?
{7171}{7241}Well, Mother, I'm sorry,|you'll have to be mad.
{7245}{7283}Oh, for heaven's sake, I'm sorry.
{7334}{7383}I'll get it!
{7419}{7482}Hello. Yeah.
{7509}{7594}- Okay. It's for you.|- Who is it?
{7609}{7639}How should I know?
{7643}{7757}Hello. Oh, Alfred North, boy producer?|It's your godfather, dopey.
{7761}{7816}How are you?|Full of opening-night jitters?
{7821}{7889}Not a jitter to my name.|Just had our final run-through.
{7893}{7953}I've never been this happy|and relaxed about a show.
{7957}{8007}It's Larry I'm worried about.
{8011}{8116}His first signed review as a major critic's|important. Everyone will look for it.
{8120}{8179}Don't make him nervous.|Let him come to the theater...
{8183}{8234}...enjoy himself and write|what he feels.
{8238}{8294}Tell him that I'm feeling|pretty sentimental...
{8298}{8364}...about my opening night being|his opening night too.
{8368}{8449}He made a fine slobbery speech|on the very same theme this morning.
{8453}{8524}- Stop it! Not you, Alfred. George.|- What?
{8528}{8608}- Not you. Alfred.|- Dear, this is a very old vaudeville bit.
{8612}{8679}- What's the matter with you?|- I have four kids in this room.
{8683}{8741}That's what's the matter with me. Out!
{8745}{8817}Darling, I've got to go.|Well, of course we'll be at the party.
{8821}{8899}I've lost five pounds and bought|a new dress for it.
{8903}{8995}All right, darling. I'll be praying|when the curtain rises. Bye-bye.
{9017}{9097}Now, stop it! Now, I mean it, now.|Go on in there and play.
{9101}{9141}- Go play with Hobo.|- He's asleep.
{9145}{9225}- That's all he does. Eat and sleep.|- Well, he's a dog.
{9229}{9304}What do you want from him,|blank verse?
{9328}{9399}What about Adam? Why don't you go|and talk to Adam for a change.
{9403}{9456}What about? Cokey-Cola?
{9580}{9642}Maybe you should've lost 10 pounds.
{9881}{9980}Help me, huh? Help me, David.|Zip it up, now.
{10042}{10096}- Sorry.|- You just took a pound of old Mother.
{10100}{10168}Now, keep going, huh?|No matter how much I holler.
{10188}{10255}- All right. Up?|- Yeah.
{10259}{10312}Okay. Thank you.
{10316}{10381}- There. How do I look, fellas?|- Like you're gonna bust.
{10385}{10423}Flatterer.
{10438}{10509}Get it for me, will you?|It's the new babysitter.
{10513}{10562}And be nice. Don't scare her.
{10618}{10654}Hi.
{10674}{10735}- Does Lawrence Mackay live here?|- Yeah, but he's not in.
{10739}{10797}Wanna talk to my mother?|That's his wife.
{10801}{10835}Yeah, if she isn't busy.
{10839}{10924}She's not busy. Just getting dressed,|that's all. Come on in.
{11163}{11275}Cokey-Cola.
{11344}{11402}- What's the matter with him?|- Nothing.
{11416}{11470}Then what's he all locked in for?
{11474}{11522}So he won't get out.
{11569}{11651}- They cage you all when you were little?|- No. Just him.
{11655}{11737}Are you Mrs. Greenfield?|No, you're not Mrs. Greenfield.
{11779}{11848}I'm Joe Positano. You Mrs. Mackay?
{11852}{11926}There's a lady runs a pet shop|off East 62nd Street. Your mother.
{11930}{11984}- Yes, I know.|- She says I should see your husband.
{11988}{12038}You see, I only drive a hack|to make money...
{12042}{12103}Why does my mother want you|to see my husband?
{12107}{12197}I wrote this play. Wait till I tell you|the idea. It will knock you on your back.
{12201}{12280}- Excuse me. I'm in an awful hurry.|- It's a musical.
{12284}{12362}It's based on the first two books|of the Old Testament.
{12366}{12447}You know, the Bible.|How's that for universal appeal?
{12451}{12503}- Staggering.|- Ain't it?
{12507}{12566}All right, so now I got it.|I want an opinion.
{12570}{12631}A little advice, maybe,|how to improve it.
{12635}{12683}Mr. Mackay is not a playwright.
{12687}{12746}Who needs a playwright?|I'm a playwright.
{12750}{12826}I need a fella who will tell me|what's wrong, if anything. A critic.
{12830}{12873}My husband is a very new critic.
{12877}{12942}Well, he was a professor of drama|at Columbia, wasn't he?
{12946}{13011}Okay, who knows more|than a professor?
{13015}{13130}Besides, I've read a lot of his articles|and reviews of off-Broadway plays.
{13134}{13234}Pips, all of them. And on top of that,|the man's a square.
{13238}{13304}When he reviews a play,|he just doesn't make wisecracks...
{13308}{13407}...like the rest of those bums.|He takes it serious.
{13446}{13491}That's true, isn't it?
{13526}{13596}What do you say? Do I get to see him?
{13638}{13697}Why don't you drop by Sunday morning.
{13753}{13819}You got yourself a deal.
{13833}{13876}- So long, fellas.|- Bye.
{13880}{13911}Don't tell him the idea.
{13915}{13967}- Let it come as a surprise.|- Okay.
{13975}{14072}- I'm Mrs...|- You scared the daylights out of me.
{14076}{14151}- Come in. It is Mrs. Greenfield, isn't it?|- Yes, indeedy.
{14155}{14213}I got my cab if you're going|anyplace but Brooklyn.
{14217}{14285}How about Eighth? My husband's|at the New Drama Workshop.
{14289}{14359}I won't start my meter till you get down.|That's the sport I am.
{14363}{14400}Deal.
{14415}{14491}Mrs. Greenfield, you may think|I'm a beast, but I have to go now.
{14495}{14543}- Do you think you can manage?|- Certainly.
{14547}{14647}I can tell just by looking at your boys|they'll be perfect gentlemen.
{14739}{14822}Into the bedroom, perfect gentlemen.|I want a few words with you.
{14826}{14926}This one's all right. Just keep an eye|on him when you let him out.
{15009}{15149}Cokey-Cola.
{15191}{15231}I beg your pardon?
{15235}{15293}I saw how you looked at her,|so don't try to kid me.
{15297}{15369}Listen, be my good and true friends.|Don't fuss about supper...
{15373}{15442}...your baths or going to bed. Okay?|- Okay.
{15446}{15525}And please don't throw anything|out of the windows or down the john.
{15529}{15600}- Well, what if I feel spit-uppy?|- What, are you expecting to?
{15604}{15658}No, but if I do, we're not|supposed to throw...
{15662}{15727}Come on! Now, listen...|David, listen to me.
{15731}{15784}Before you do anything,|think about what I'd say.
{15788}{15851}Gee, Ma, you act as if we were monsters|or something.
{15855}{15950}Well, you are. You're just lucky that I|happen to be peculiar and love monsters.
{15954}{16034}Now, give me a kiss. Give me a kiss.
{16042}{16105}I'm just a kissless mother.|That's all I am.
{16109}{16169}The numbers where I can be reached|are on the desk.
{16173}{16263}The boys' supper is in the refrigerator.|I think that's everything. I hope.
{16267}{16319}Mrs. Mackay, do you mind my asking...
{16323}{16401}...what's the problem with the boy?|- Adam?
{16405}{16487}When I saw the barred windows and the|locked pen, my heart bled for you.
{16491}{16587}- Is he backward?|- Backward?
{16591}{16678}When you were 18 months old,|could you pick a lock? Any lock?
{16682}{16738}- Certainly not.|- Well, Adam can.
{16804}{16853}Good night.
{17032}{17087}There are many theories|about the drama:
{17091}{17158}That it should educate people|or inspire them.
{17162}{17225}That it should reflect life or change it.
{17229}{17323}Now, I believe it can do any of these,|provided it also entertains.
{17327}{17391}Because to my mind, the basic|function of all theater...
{17395}{17475}...from Greek drama to the circus,|is to entertain.
{17479}{17535}Bravo.
{17539}{17629}I'm sure we are all very grateful|to Professor Mackay.
{17633}{17771}Or shall I say ex-Professor Mackay, since,|as of today, he begins a new career...
{17775}{17891}...as one of the seven major drama critics|of the {y:i}New York Press.
{17895}{17947}Question. Question, Mr. Mackay.
{17959}{18047}The major drama critics have a great|influence on our theater and great power.
{18051}{18171}You yourself, as a part-time reviewer,|have been a constructive and fair man.
{18175}{18295}Do you think you can stay fair now that|you're one of the holy seven?
{18303}{18395}Well, to me, my job merely means that|I'll be able to spend much more time...
{18399}{18467}...doing the one thing I love most,|going to the theater.
{18471}{18535}But you won't be just any|loving theatergoer.
{18539}{18606}You'll be one of seven men who can|close any show in town.
{18610}{18667}- And I can guarantee that as...|- Just a minute.
{18671}{18774}You guys go to a play hoping it's lousy.|It isn't what's on-stage that matters.
{18778}{18838}It's how clever you can be|about trying to destroy it.
{18863}{18958}Well, I assure you that every opening|night, when the curtain goes up...
{18962}{19018}...I shall hope to see something great.
{19022}{19083}But I shall be paid by my newspaper|to give my opinion.
{19095}{19155}So, what else can I do,|except give it honestly?
{19159}{19193}That's what you say now.
{19197}{19248}Why should your opinion mean|more than others?
{19252}{19312}Who are you to set yourself up|in judgment, anyway?
{19316}{19347}Please!
{19363}{19414}- Of all the nasty little...|- Oh, they're young.
{19418}{19484}It's difficult for them, getting started,|to open a theater.
{19488}{19587}Still, they do seem to have|a certain hostility to critics.
{19591}{19639}I noticed.
{19707}{19755}Happy about tonight?
{19759}{19810}All lit up inside, you know?
{19829}{19884}Something about getting to the top|of your field.
{19888}{19943}Even if it's only the bottom|of the top.
{19947}{20001}And the fact I'm starting|with Alfred's show.
{20005}{20088}Very, very gratifying.
{20119}{20209}- You're pretty gratifying in that getup.|- Think so?
{20213}{20291}- Very handsome. Very distinguished.|- Thank you.
{20295}{20332}I may be starting a legend.
{20336}{20420}Mackay, never seen at an opening night|without two suits.
{20434}{20539}- I'll drop the stuff off at your apartment.|- Oh, Joe, you're an angel.
{20553}{20621}- {y:i}Who 's he?|- Darling, this is Joe Positano.
{20625}{20661}He's a friend of mine.
{20665}{20699}- Hi, Mr. Mac...|- Look out!
{20755}{20783}Dear.
{20787}{20824}Oh, boy.
{20855}{20926}Sure got off to a flying start with him.
{20963}{21052}I have a feeling there's something|about you two that I should know.
{21083}{21169}Well, actually, Joe's a friend|of Mother's.
{21173}{21238}No, that's not the point.
{21242}{21339}Well... Well, he's written a play,|and he wants you to read it.
{21343}{21395}There. Now you know.
{21495}{21603}Look how he looks. Wounded,|like a salmon caught on a hook.
{21607}{21677}What are you getting yourself|in an uproar for?
{21681}{21742}Look, there'll come a night|when you can't sleep.
{21746}{21823}You'll look for something to read.|Instead of {y:i}The Saturday Review...
{21827}{21911}...you read my play. What's so terrible?
{21915}{22006}- Okay. You got a deal. To the theater.|- Right.
{22343}{22400}What made me think Alfred|could do a musical?
{22404}{22483}What made Alfred think he could do one?|He knows nothing about music.
{22487}{22590}- His analyst said it'd bring gaiety to him.|- His analyst ought to see an analyst.
{22594}{22655}Honey, Alfred didn't make the show|terrible on purpose.
{22659}{22728}It just seems that way|when you look at it.
{22739}{22779}Yes?
{22783}{22870}All right, I won't be long. That's the|composing room. They're waiting.
{22903}{22942}Look, Alfred is our best friend.
{22946}{23031}Maybe I should just hold on to that|and give the show a rave.
{23042}{23112}No, I can't start off as the drama critic|for this newspaper...
{23116}{23246}...by writing a dishonest review.|Alfred wouldn't want that, would he?
{23263}{23375}The first day I got the job, he said,|"Larry, all I'll ask of you is the truth."
{23407}{23462}He said it just as he finished|his fourth martini.
{23501}{23577}I'm being ridiculous,|because Alfred's a real pro.
{23581}{23677}- He'll take this in his stride.|- Oh, darling, of course he will.
{23681}{23756}Besides, you didn't say a mean word|about anybody.
{23772}{23854}It was the kindest way anyone ever|didn't like a show.
{23883}{23986}Come on. Let's drink our wine|and forget it.
{24204}{24243}What do you want?
{24267}{24335}Just a hand.
{24381}{24419}Pete.
{24439}{24541}Yes, Mr. Mackay?|Oh, you finish already?
{24545}{24607}Keep the wine coming.|We've had a darling day.
{24611}{24679}Oh, is too bad. Excuse me.
{24851}{24907}Honey, look.
{24922}{24975}Aren't they cute?
{25051}{25132}How much there is to say|in the beginning.
{25136}{25207}Not the first couple of times|I took you out.
{25211}{25255}"Yes, Mr. Mackay." "No, Mr. Mackay."
{25266}{25352}Well, I couldn't get over your being|a professor, dear.
{25356}{25465}Remember how shocked I was|the first time you made a pass at me?
{25469}{25554}Of course, secretly I was dying for you|to make it.
{25558}{25663}But even so, it just didn't|seem dignified...
{25685}{25723}...for a professor.
{25727}{25835}- Well, at least it started you talking.|- That was big talk.
{25839}{25961}Life, death, who had|the happiest childhood.
{25965}{26045}Are you for or against modern art,|psychoanalysis, large families?
{26055}{26099}Against.
{26103}{26143}By the way, how are the kids?
{26147}{26211}- Impossible.|- That's good.
{26313}{26352}- Kate.|- Yes, darling?
{26356}{26427}There's one more thing|I want to tell you about Alfred.
{26438}{26515}Oh, you are such a mood-killer.
{27191}{27233}Let's go home.
{28247}{28279}Oh, hi.
{28297}{28387}I'm not complaining. I just wish you'd|fall asleep in my bed sometimes.
{28391}{28499}I'm sorry, darling. They wake|each other up. That's the trouble.
{28503}{28559}Once the boys have their own rooms,|things are...
{28563}{28603}- Larry, today's the day.|- What day?
{28607}{28699}The real-estate lady's coming.|Don't forget, we're looking at houses.
{28703}{28747}Great. In the country. Did you tell her?
{28751}{28827}- Not the chic country, the plain country.|- I told her everything.
{28831}{28895}That the boys' rooms have to be|in another county.
{28899}{28979}There has to be a little terrace|so that we can have breakfast alone.
{28983}{29074}Hey. There's a fair chance|we can do that right now.
{29099}{29149}Just the two of us?
{29173}{29239}I can't remember what it's like.
{29289}{29378}- Don't suppose you'd wait, just once?|- Do you think it's a chance worth taking?
{29382}{29444}I'll dress. Maybe the boys|will sleep longer. Who knows?
{29448}{29505}Who knows? I know.
{29863}{29924}Come on. Put the dish down, now.
{29974}{30017}- Morning, Dad!|- Morning, Dad!
{30021}{30095}Good morning, gentlemen.|Where's the paper?
{30099}{30130}In on the table.
{30134}{30202}It's oatmeal again, Dad.|Can't you talk to her about it?
{30206}{30252}You know what the moron|said to his wife?
{30256}{30303}We'll discuss the oatmeal|at a later date.
{30307}{30361}Certainly I know what the moron|said to his wife.
{30365}{30425}He said, "Let's have breakfast alone."
{30429}{30489}It was just a silly whim.|What would we talk about?
{30493}{30526}- Give me the cream.|- "Please."
{30530}{30580}- All right.|- Hey.
{30584}{30617}We could talk about Hobo.
{30621}{30730}If he can't walk in and out of elevators|on his own feet, he'll have to diet.
{30734}{30769}- Drink your milk.|- Kate.
{30773}{30863}Speaking of diets, could we please|have some real bread just once...
{30867}{30948}...instead of this no-calorie, no-taste...?|- The stores are open to all.
{30952}{31011}If you want it, go out and buy it.
{31015}{31061}I'm sorry.
{31071}{31123}David, see who it is, dear.
{31164}{31216}George, stop kicking the table|with your foot.
{31220}{31311}- I'm not kicking, I'm tapping.|- Stop tapping the table with your foot.
{31315}{31374}- Come on, angel.|- It isn't his foot, it's a fork.
{31378}{31412}Just one of the kitchen forks.
{31416}{31456}Look, will you stop doing anything.
{31460}{31516}- You want us to stop eating?|- For heaven's sake.
{31520}{31572}- Now pick up...|- Guess who's here.
{31589}{31621}Come sit near me.
{31625}{31720}- Hi, Uncle Alfred!|- Want some oatmeal? It's good for you.
{31724}{31856}Morning, George, Gabriel, Adam, Kate.
{31893}{31952}Morning, friend.
{31960}{32005}You're just in time for a cup|of coffee.
{32009}{32112}- I'm glad you came over, Alfred.|- Now, that's a funny line.
{32116}{32197}I was going to call you up, only I wanted|to make sure you were up.
{32201}{32268}Do you imagine I slept|after this betrayal?
{32272}{32328}- Won't you please have a cup of coffee?|- Kate!
{32332}{32396}If there's some coffee|that must be drunk, drink it!
{32400}{32494}Alfred, you must realize I would have|given my soul to have liked your play.
{32498}{32575}- I had to be honest, didn't I?|- In print? No!
{32588}{32656}Not if 20 years' friendship|meant anything to you.
{32660}{32757}I'll be glad to discuss it with you|after you've calmed down.
{32790}{32874}All right. Seems fair.
{33128}{33171}Cokey-Cola?
{33347}{33405}- Am I calm enough now?|- Alfred.
{33409}{33511}Before we say anything else, I swear to|you, I sweated blood over that review.
{33515}{33573}And your friendship means|a great deal to me.
{33599}{33715}Kid, if this was written by a friend,|I don't need any enemies.
{33735}{33795}"Whatever the theatrical season brings...
{33799}{33882}...this offering must be considered|its greatest disappointment."
{33886}{33949}- That's friendly?|- Read the rest of it.
{33953}{34030}"Because it comes from Alfred North,|whose magnificent record..."
{34034}{34106}- Then I list all your past glories.|- To show how low I've fallen.
{34110}{34158}You're going to misinterpret every word.
{34162}{34210}There's more than one way|to interpret this?
{34214}{34308}"Miss Deborah Vaughn, the star|of this piece, is no actress.
{34312}{34413}It seems unnecessarily cruel to say|anything more. " Charming.
{34417}{34482}If she'd been charming,|I'd have said so.
{34486}{34523}Mom, what are they so mad about?
{34527}{34599}They're not mad, dear.|They're having a difference of opinion.
{34603}{34662}Right. One of us thinks|the other of us is a louse.
{34666}{34716}- You better go!|- I'll go when I'm ready.
{34720}{34795}I've every right to be here.|I'm the godfather of these kiddies.
{34799}{34861}Their guardian, if anything happens|to their dear dad.
{34865}{34939}And that's not so far-fetched,|dear old Dad.
{34943}{34989}You're living dangerously these days.
{34993}{35043}I don't have to sit here|and listen to this!
{35054}{35103}- I'll call.|- Will you listen to me objectively?
{35107}{35198}You want me to take the kids|to the park and out of the way?
{35202}{35287}Now, look, Kate, I am not being|unreasonable. I hate Larry!
{35291}{35416}Salad without dressing, rye toast|without butter and black coffee.
{35420}{35535}It's crazy, isn't it, when you consider|what a nice shape Mrs. Mackay got?
{35539}{35608}Let's double-cross her. Give her|eggs Benedict, hash browns...
{35612}{35657}...and cheesecake.
{35661}{35738}- She'll kill you.|- Not till after she's eaten.
{36097}{36179}- You're Lawrence Mackay?|- Yes.
{36183}{36253}- I'm Deborah Vaughn.|- Yes, I know.
{36257}{36364}Good. In that case,|I'm sure you'll understand.
{36466}{36541}- Did you get it?|- Could I have one more just to be safe?
{36545}{36595}You bet your sweet life.
{36898}{36941}Larry, sit down.
{37006}{37073}We're not going to run and hide.
{37138}{37226}- Will you stop looking so guilty?|- I feel guilty.
{37246}{37325}That poor girl. She never would've|done that if she hadn't been...
{37329}{37374}...terribly upset by my review.
{37378}{37454}Now, wait a minute.|One slap, all right, she's upset.
{37458}{37507}But two slaps?
{37511}{37589}Because the photographer she brought|didn't get the first one.
{37627}{37691}- Well, how do you like that?|- I don't.
{37695}{37744}Next question.
{37962}{38003}Still burning?
{38007}{38081}I find I don't like having|my face slapped.
{38085}{38202}Don't think I'm gonna like seeing pictures|of it spread all over the newspapers.
{38237}{38329}Honey, us broads own the world.
{38343}{38409}You can't hit back at her|without being a cad.
{38413}{38519}I'm worse than that already.|I'm a first-string critic, a sitting duck.
{38523}{38582}The man you love to hate.
{38599}{38691}If it's love you're looking for,|I think you're in the wrong racket.
{38695}{38764}I'll settle for honest hate|if that's what the job brings...
{38768}{38815}...but a slap for publicity is not honest.
{38819}{38909}That's something you do to some poor|schnook who won't hit back.
{38921}{38994}Well, I might as well serve notice|right at the start.
{38998}{39048}"Hit me at your own risk."
{39052}{39099}If they treat me like Jack the Ripper...
{39103}{39194}...I'm not gonna respond like|John the Gent. May I?
{39215}{39331}Miss Vaughn may have the last slap,|but I'm going to have the last laugh.
{39395}{39442}Eggs Benedict?
{39559}{39603}Good morning, Alice.
{39682}{39754}- Are you decent?|- Come on in.
{39894}{39957}Congratulations.|Yesterday was a slack day.
{39961}{40023}Nobody started a war|or assassinated anybody.
{40027}{40079}There was nothing to put|on the front page.
{40083}{40122}Nothing but you.
{40187}{40303}Well. Sing hallelujah,|like the song says.
{40343}{40412}Read me the words, Alfred.
{40450}{40486}With expression, please.
{40490}{40564}Well, there's a description|of the battle itself.
{40568}{40670}Biographies of the two contenders,|yours mentioning that you're 29.
{40674}{40714}I have been.
{40718}{40815}Then there's a column headed, "He Who|Got Slapped," signed Lawrence Mackay.
{40819}{40865}An apology?
{40869}{40941}"I am a mild man. I have been known|to step aside...
{40945}{41002}...to give a caterpillar right of way.
{41006}{41117}I abhor physical violence,|especially when it is directed at me.
{41121}{41226}So when Miss Deborah Vaughn slapped|my face at Sardi's yesterday...
{41230}{41273}...I abhorred it plenty.
{41277}{41383}What unmentionable thing had I done|to merit such treatment?
{41393}{41479}Well, in a recent review, I said|that Miss Vaughn is no actress.
{41483}{41528}But that is a fact, and not debatable."
{41541}{41597}- This next is in capital letters.|- Go ahead.
{41601}{41647}"She cannot act.
{41675}{41747}Neither can she dance, sing|nor move scenery...
{41751}{41811}...all legitimate reasons|for being on a stage.
{41815}{41918}What she does do is wiggle her fanny.|Now, that is also..."
{42030}{42102}"This, too, justifies being on the stage.
{42106}{42177}It depends, to be blunt, on the fanny.
{42181}{42335}When it is Miss Vaughn's fanny, she still|has no reason for being on the stage."
{42344}{42479}Why, the lying slob! I'll match my fanny|against any fanny in America!
{42488}{42547}I want you to.|And I'm not alone in that.
{42551}{42629}We've had a very busy box office|since that came out.
{42633}{42750}- Well, well and well.|- Exactly.
{42754}{42846}I was going to close the show|on Saturday. But I can't now.
{42850}{42975}Not as long as the public insists upon|making up its own mind about your fanny.
{43088}{43126}Here you are, third week running.
{43130}{43187}This time they call you|"ex-gentle, ex-genial...
{43191}{43241}...ex-professor Lawrence Mackay."
{43245}{43315}They cut down trees to make paper|to print that?
{43355}{43459}The desk of Lawrence Mackay.|Who's calling, please?
{43471}{43503}Mr. Perkins.
{43507}{43577}- Your publisher?|- Tell him I'll call him tomorrow.
{43593}{43705}Mr. Mackay will call you tomorrow.|He's busy editing a poison-pen column.
{43719}{43774}You writing a book on all this jazz?
{43778}{43849}No, I'm writing a book called|{y:i}Presentations of Dramatic Art.
{43853}{43931}But until all this jazz,|nobody seemed to care.
{43974}{44052}Darling. How is the most ravishing|woman on 62nd Street?
{44062}{44143}Angel. It's my son-in-law,|Lawrence Mackay, the critic.
{44147}{44190}The one who got slapped.
{44194}{44304}No, dear, she isn't here yet.|All right, sweetie. I'll tell her.
{44308}{44363}Oh, an absolute darling, and brilliant.
{44367}{44446}Mrs. Robinson, Jeremy seems depressed.
{44450}{44538}Jeremy resented being bathed,|and he's looking for sympathy.
{44542}{44638}- Just ignore it.|- Thank you. Goodbye.
{44642}{44695}- Hi, Grandma!|- Hi.
{44699}{44768}- We got a deal for you.|- David will explain it. Only say yes.
{44772}{44825}- Say you'll say yes.|- Well, quiet, everybody.
{44829}{44863}Give Grandma a chance.
{44867}{44923}Kate, when I want quiet,|I'll ask for it.
{44927}{44962}Now, what is the deal?
{44966}{45047}George and I need a new turtle.|Ours got swept in the vacuum cleaner.
{45051}{45130}- And Gabe needs a new angelfish.|- On account of my old one got et.
{45134}{45192}But on our allowance,|we can't save enough money.
{45196}{45251}We thought you'd let us|pay for it by working.
{45255}{45346}Fair enough. Here. First you can|feed the fish. Now, divide that up.
{45350}{45390}Here. Here, come on.
{45394}{45476}Come on, sonny boy. Come on.
{45531}{45607}- Did you see Hector?|- There's your friend, sweetheart.
{45611}{45643}Hector, say hello to Adam.
{45647}{45699}Oops, dearie!
{45746}{45789}It's a no-no.
{45811}{45910}- He's learned a new word.|- Making a grand total of two.
{45914}{45947}My big boy.
{45951}{46026}Gabriel, don't get too close|to that monkey. He squirts.
{46030}{46096}When you were his age,|all you could say was "Daddy."
{46100}{46157}Keep it quiet, will you?
{46170}{46264}- Speaking of Dad, I'd better make a call.|- Larry called. He'll meet you at the party.
{46268}{46335}- Who's giving this one?|- Mona James.
{46339}{46383}The actress?
{46402}{46451}It's only our fourth this week.
{46455}{46535}I'm rapidly turning into a big,|fat, soggy hors d'oeuvre.
{46539}{46597}What's with this mutt?|I had to park a block away.
{46601}{46672}You think he'd walk? Not on your life.
{46684}{46741}He's very badly trained, Joe.
{46745}{46802}Now, don't look at me. He's Larry's dog.
{46806}{46870}Well, he's with you more.
{46874}{46943}Can't win. Joe will take me|to the party and come back...
{46947}{47006}...and drive you and the boys|to the apartment. Okay?
{47010}{47076}- All right. Have a nice time.|- Thanks a lot, darling.
{47080}{47159}Boys, come into my office.|Front and center.
{47184}{47264}All right, listen. Grandma's doing|me a favor by taking care of you.
{47268}{47322}- She likes it.|- Never mind she likes it.
{47326}{47394}- Don't make it a night to remember.|- Okay.
{47398}{47456}Don't forget to have the doorman|take Hobo out.
{47460}{47498}- Okay.|- Where's Hobo?
{47502}{47552}- Hobo?|- Hobo?
{47556}{47619}- Adam.|- Daddy.
{47623}{47659}Where are you?
{47663}{47693}Look.
{47697}{47729}Daddy.
{47892}{47940}There are interesting failures...
{47944}{47991}...there are prestige failures...
{47995}{48037}...and there are financial failures.
{48041}{48126}But this is the sort of failure|that gives failures a bad name.
{48181}{48223}- Mona.|- Oh, Kate. Kate, darling.
{48227}{48286}- I want you to meet Jane March.|- How do you do.
{48290}{48351}Mr. Mackay, I've been|longing to meet you.
{48355}{48387}She writes plays.
{48391}{48459}Kate, sometimes I loathe the theater.
{48463}{48505}The lying, the buttering.
{48509}{48584}If I had a simple life like yours,|with all those wonderful kids...
{48588}{48659}How many are there by now, darling?|I lose track.
{48663}{48725}- Just four.|- The girls are twins, aren't they?
{48729}{48826}- The girls? Yes, Lana and Mar...|- George, darling. You need a drink.
{48830}{48884}Angel, I must go and hostess.
{48888}{48967}- George, I'm so glad to see you, darling.|- Nice to see you.
{49191}{49251}- Hello there.|- Hello.
{49499}{49574}I've been watching you,|hoping you'd come over.
{49578}{49617}You have?
{49641}{49723}You don't belong in this room|full of spooks.
{49800}{49887}You're young. Alive. Beautiful.
{49891}{49934}Come on.
{49965}{49999}What are you...
{50004}{50049}...doing later?
{50132}{50181}Thanks anyway, sonny.
{50185}{50215}No dice?
{50219}{50258}Not a one.
{50267}{50358}In that case, would you mind moving|and giving somebody else a chance?
{50388}{50431}It's a pleasure.
{50454}{50519}- Good luck.|- Thanks.
{50691}{50770}- You thought I'd forgotten you. Here.|- It isn't gin I need...
{50774}{50839}...it's a nice juicy steak|with french-fried potatoes.
{50843}{50897}You do have a show to cover,|and if we don't...
{50901}{50935}There you are, you darling man.
{50939}{51023}I was terrified you'd gone without|telling me what to do with my third act.
{51027}{51074}- Have you met my wife?|- How do you do.
{51078}{51136}You will let me have him for a moment,|won't you?
{51140}{51209}He's going to tell me what to do|with my third act.
{51213}{51275}Go ahead, honey.|Tell her what to do with her third act.
{51279}{51375}Now, then, darling, I have a problem.|Excuse me. I have a terrible problem...
{51515}{51591}Hello. Would you please|get up off of me?
{51596}{51655}Heaven's sake.
{51711}{51756}- Mona.|- Put this out for me, darling.
{51760}{51790}Mona.
{51794}{51828}- Mona.|- Yes, dear?
{51832}{51898}I think your dog ate|one of my earrings.
{51902}{51977}It's so small. I don't think|it'll do her any harm.
{52138}{52188}Be my guest, chum.
{52499}{52546}Larry, darling.
{52550}{52588}Someone here to see you.
{52820}{52883}Dear Mr. Mackay, don't be frightened.
{52887}{52943}I have come not to slap...
{52947}{52994}...but to forgive.
{53129}{53207}- I insist on turning the other cheek.|- All right.
{53277}{53396}Now that the smoke of battle|has cleared, may I ask a question?
{53400}{53481}Are you flexible enough to reconsider...
{53485}{53567}...a perhaps hastily formed opinion?
{53571}{53601}I think so. I hope so.
{53605}{53645}Good.
{54003}{54044}I was wrong.
{54053}{54092}Thank you.
{54882}{54918}Alfred.
{54922}{54958}What are you doing in here?
{54962}{55013}Reading about the mad Mackays|in the columns.
{55017}{55102}Cocktail parties left and right,|among those seen at El Morocco.
{55106}{55165}Far cry from the simple souls|I once knew.
{55169}{55239}I'll bet Larry's loving this whole megillah.
{55243}{55283}Now, why shouldn't he love it?
{55287}{55371}Well, now, you know how shy|and unpushy he's always been.
{55375}{55467}- Why shouldn't he enjoy a little flurry?|- Little flurry? Listen, Kate.
{55471}{55555}Your own true love has set his foot|on the first step of the down-alator.
{55559}{55609}- The what?|- Opposite number of the escalator.
{55613}{55683}The down-alator. It leads to the|place where all bad critics go.
{55687}{55713}Come on.
{55717}{55773}For a critic, that first step|is his first joke.
{55777}{55809}People laugh.
{55814}{55856}Whole new world opens up.
{55860}{55910}He makes another joke, another.
{55914}{55970}Then along comes a joke|that shouldn't be made...
{55974}{56055}...because the show he's reviewing|is a good show.
{56059}{56119}But the joke happens|to be a good joke...
{56123}{56158}...and you know what?
{56162}{56201}The joke wins.
{56205}{56262}That will never happen to Larry.
{56266}{56351}It seems to me he's beginning|to find himself a very amusing fellow.
{56355}{56395}You're just being a stinker.
{56399}{56493}Right, and I shall go on being a stinker|until I've evened up the score.
{56536}{56617}Excuse me, please. If we don't go,|we'll miss the first act.
{56621}{56711}Might be a blessing to all concerned.|Especially the playwright.
{57016}{57046}Who's your money on?
{57050}{57096}Grandma or the monsters?
{57442}{57524}- What happened?|- The good guy just shot the bad guy.
{57528}{57578}That's nice.
{57593}{57638}- Did you hold the taxi?|- Yeah. Joe.
{57642}{57707}He's waiting and making big talk|about buying you a pizza.
{57711}{57756}- Then I better get my coat.|- Here it is.
{57760}{57802}Thank you, dear.
{57812}{57891}Isn't it time you made some big talk|about reading Joe's play?
{57895}{57943}Tomorrow. I'll give it all morning.
{57947}{58004}- Were the boys much trouble?|- Not a bit.
{58008}{58061}You're the only one|who can't handle them.
{58065}{58142}You're so right. Thanks, honey.|I'll call you tomorrow.
{58146}{58249}- Come on. I'll ride you down the elevator.|- I'll ride myself down in the elevator.
{58253}{58337}See what's ailing your wife. When Kate|won't pick a fight with me...
{58341}{58375}...something's wrong.
{58379}{58427}- Night, dear.|- Night.
{58804}{58892}- Tickles.|- That's a fine romantic reaction.
{58896}{58942}I'd better take a look at the boys.
{58946}{58987}Hey, hey.
{59011}{59067}Suppose you take a look at this boy.
{59099}{59174}Why do you always get embarrassed|when you're angry with me?
{59235}{59281}Then you are angry.
{59308}{59338}Confused.
{59342}{59397}- So? Say it.|- I love you.
{59405}{59483}Well, just fine, because I love you.
{59496}{59566}Not exactly a tragic situation, is it?
{59575}{59607}I mean, we're not...
{59611}{59706}...star-crossed lovers separated|by feuding families, are we?
{59710}{59775}We're home in our own room.
{59779}{59855}For once in their lives, all our|children seem to be asleep.
{59874}{59903}We're even married.
{59907}{59974}So, what's the problem?
{60041}{60076}Darling?
{60084}{60136}Did you slam the play tonight|just to be funny?
{60140}{60205}- Or did you really hate it?|- I hated it. Didn't you?
{60209}{60247}Yes, but that's not the point.
{60251}{60318}Did you make up your mind in advance|you wouldn't like it?
{60334}{60396}Of course not. Why?
{60412}{60460}Because of what you said at the party.
{60464}{60494}What was that?
{60498}{60555}That it'd be a kindness|to miss the first act.
{60559}{60626}Cocktail-party talk. That's all.
{60630}{60717}People standing around, I was on.|"Look at me, Ma, I'm the town wit."
{60731}{60779}- Honest?|- Of course, honest.
{60785}{60855}Oh, Kate. Is that's what's been|bothering you all night?
{60900}{60969}I just don't want you on that|down-alator, that's all.
{60973}{61008}The what?
{61012}{61050}Never mind.
{61054}{61091}Forget it.
{61109}{61147}Oh, boy.
{61151}{61250}It's a terrible thing when a man discovers|that the mother of his children is an idiot.
{61255}{61322}I imagine I should be quite upset|when I think about it.
{61326}{61372}A few hours from now.
{61376}{61425}I'm thirsty.
{61478}{61530}- Any of your brothers awake?|- Sure, all of them.
{61534}{61593}We chose for who'd come|and get you. I won.
{61597}{61639}We could ignore them.
{61644}{61718}Now, you know and I know|that's a no-no.
{61727}{61777}See you around sometime.
{62052}{62103}Brought you some coffee.
{62148}{62203}Doggy.
{62263}{62293}Hi, kid.
{62365}{62411}Getting a little stir-crazy?
{62415}{62461}I'll let you out.
{62657}{62708}Daddy?
{62739}{62778}Did he say "Daddy"?
{62782}{62819}To you?
{62898}{62947}Yesterday he said it to Hobo.
{62951}{63009}- He's getting warmer. I'm human.|- Adam.
{63013}{63055}I'm Daddy. Let's get this clear.
{63059}{63137}I'm Daddy. Daddy. Daddy.
{63153}{63255}Cut it out, will you, blabbermouth?|You wanna prejudice my case?
{63283}{63338}Big help you are.
{63501}{63566}Could you at least give me a clue|how you like it?
{63583}{63651}Joe, what made you|choose a biblical setting?
{63704}{63750}You got something against the Bible?
{63754}{63858}No. Why set your play in Jerusalem|when what you know is New York?
{63862}{63968}Every writer, particularly an inexperienced|one, should stick in his own back yard.
{63972}{64067}Well, I took lots of writing courses|at NYU nights.
{64071}{64113}Nobody said there was a rule about it.
{64117}{64212}No easier way to look ridiculous than|trying something you don't know.
{64216}{64247}I'll give you an example.
{64251}{64299}Here's Father Abraham...
{64303}{64371}...ordering a sacrificial lamb.
{64403}{64495}"I'll have a small sheep,|and make it quick, boy."
{64500}{64573}Sounds like some guy in Lindy's|ordering a hot pastrami sandwich.
{64577}{64628}You weren't trying to be funny,|were you?
{64632}{64683}No, I wasn't trying to be funny.
{64687}{64757}You'd have the audience rolling.|There's a couple more...
{64761}{64835}Never mind. You've had|your laugh for the day.
{64839}{64911}Just a minute. If you're gonna|be a pro, you can't be sensitive.
{64915}{64945}I can't?
{64949}{64979}Why not?
{64983}{65026}What'd you do, pass another rule?
{65030}{65099}Who do you think you are, Moses|handing down the Commandments?
{65103}{65189}I may not be Moses. I'm the man|you asked to read your play.
{65208}{65252}Oh, no, you're not.
{65259}{65319}You're another fellow altogether.
{65323}{65377}I wouldn't give you two cents|for his opinion.
{65381}{65415}Or anyone else's.
{65419}{65519}You're like every hysterical writer|in the world. All you want is praise.
{65527}{65578}Well, be my guest. You're a genius.
{65582}{65616}Boy, writers.
{65620}{65662}- Mr. Mackay?|- You want Mr. Mackay?
{65666}{65703}Take him!|Wear him in good health.
{65707}{65775}Writers. They're all alike.|Whining hothouse plants.
{65779}{65843}Dig up Chaucer. Dig up Homer.|And what do you find?
{65847}{65894}You find a guy just like that. Hello.
{65913}{65946}Oh, Mr. Perkins.
{65950}{65990}What's the problem?
{65997}{66027}Well...
{66031}{66063}How do you do.
{66067}{66151}Well, that makes the publication date|awfully close, doesn't it?
{66155}{66225}You do, huh? Big splash?
{66243}{66321}Yes, I guess I am a little|better-known now.
{66332}{66427}Yes, yes, I agree. We should have|much more bite than we ever...
{66459}{66488}Hey.
{66492}{66543}- What are you doing?|- Measuring.
{66547}{66619}- Nine feet.|- Measuring?
{66632}{66675}I'll call you back.
{66679}{66711}Who are you two, anyway?
{66715}{66793}I'm Justin Withers, from the rental office|which handles this building.
{66797}{66843}- This is Miss Smith.|- Eighty-one inches.
{66847}{66907}Who's taken a year's lease|on the apartment.
{66912}{66955}On this apartment?
{66959}{67017}But I live here,|with my wife and my little boys.
{67021}{67067}Not as of three weeks from tomorrow.
{67071}{67140}Your wife informed us months ago|you didn't care to renew.
{67144}{67232}- Fifty-two.|- Poor Mr. Mackay. Had you forgotten?
{67236}{67278}Let's take a look at the bedroom.
{67282}{67378}Miss Smith, look. We can't possibly|find a place to move to in three weeks.
{67382}{67448}Couldn't you stay where you are|for just a little while?
{67452}{67490}Why should I?
{67494}{67570}Well, as a favor, obviously.|One human being to another.
{67574}{67637}Why should I do you a favor?|I don't know you from Adam.
{67641}{67683}Daddy?
{67687}{67722}Daddy?
{67735}{67782}What's with him? Queer?
{67786}{67828}He's confused, like I am.
{67833}{67916}- Miss Smith...|- Mr. Mackay, I'm tired.
{67920}{67987}I don't like being awake in the daytime.
{67991}{68084}I know you're in a spot.|But it's your spot.
{68088}{68131}Let's take a look at that bedroom.
{68135}{68188}No. No. I'm sorry.
{68192}{68233}I can play tough too, you know.
{68237}{68331}I'm still the legal tenant, and your being|here at all is an invasion of privacy.
{68335}{68429}Not when it says in your lease|that the apartment may be shown...
{68433}{68505}...between 10 and 4 without notice.
{68509}{68589}I don't play tough, buster.
{68593}{68638}Excuse me.
{68696}{68750}Boy. That's a scary one.
{68754}{68822}I've been terrified all morning.
{68851}{68930}She doesn't like being awake in the day?|What is she, a vampire bat?
{68934}{68983}Mr. Withers.
{69071}{69106}Look, Dad. New shoes.
{69110}{69190}- I got loafers. Watch me, Dad.|- Settle down, everybody.
{69194}{69251}Boy, have I had it.
{69263}{69335}They can go barefoot|till they're in college.
{69348}{69404}My poor feet.
{69421}{69519}I just saw Joe pulling away|looking rather grim.
{69526}{69633}- What's ailing him?|- Never mind him. Something's ailing us.
{69641}{69718}- There's a strange lady in the bedroom.|- David, there is not.
{69722}{69779}Yes, there is.|There's also a strange man.
{69783}{69847}But it's the lady what's terrible.|She's the new tenant.
{69851}{69931}And in exactly three weeks|and one day, she's moving in here.
{69936}{70042}Well, she's got a lot of nerve.|The beds aren't even made.
{70077}{70128}Larry, why would you let...?
{70138}{70211}Three weeks and one day? Oh, Larry.
{70215}{70281}Kate. Why haven't you been looking,|for heaven's sake?
{70285}{70370}Because every time I made a date|to look, you canceled, for heaven's sake.
{70374}{70445}I didn't wanna find a house by myself.
{70464}{70535}It'd be like getting married by myself.
{70545}{70601}We'll have to ask her|for more time, that's all.
{70605}{70638}I've asked her.
{70642}{70685}I don't think she likes men.
{70689}{70728}Then I'll ask her.
{70732}{70791}I don't like women any better.
{70795}{70883}I don't want to be a squealer,|but the boys are jumping on the beds.
{70887}{70943}Mr. Withers, maybe you have|another apartment.
{70947}{71013}Preferably a larger one.|Perhaps on Park or Fifth?
{71017}{71082}Not even a smaller one. Nothing.
{71086}{71184}Poor Mr. Mackay.|And poor Mrs. Mackay.
{71237}{71286}Now, why did you ask him|about an apartment?
{71290}{71349}You know we don't want an apartment.|We want a house.
{71353}{71458}We don't want it on Fifth or Park.|We want it in the country. Always have.
{71462}{71530}- Well, it's just that...|- It's just that what?
{71534}{71593}I've been thinking.|It seems to me that if we...
{71597}{71652}You've been thinking about it|without telling me?
{71656}{71704}I do have the right to think, don't I?
{71708}{71803}I know, but we haven't thought about|a new lampshade without discussing it.
{71807}{71891}Well, I'm discussing this right now.|At least I'm trying to.
{71925}{71955}Okay.
{71959}{71994}Go ahead.
{71998}{72027}Discuss.
{72031}{72061}Okay.
{72080}{72166}It's just that in the past few months,|things have changed a little.
{72174}{72212}What's changed?
{72216}{72303}A girl slapped you at Sardi's,|you got a little publicity.
{72307}{72378}Now we go to the kind of parties|we used to hate.
{72382}{72435}- That's all that's changed.|- Not quite all.
{72439}{72503}My publisher thinks my book|may become a bestseller.
{72507}{72594}I've had offers to write articles for|what are known as "class magazines."
{72598}{72659}I've been invited to appear|on a TV show whose guest...
{72663}{72716}Guess what!|I did a double-back somersault.
{72720}{72804}Mazeltov. Whose guest last week was|an ex-president of the United States.
{72808}{72846}Mazeltov to you.
{72850}{72923}Larry, what has that got to do|with our moving to the country?
{72927}{73002}I like living in the city now.|I like being part of the theater.
{73006}{73073}I like being wanted and accepted|by the people who count.
{73077}{73115}By important people.
{73119}{73163}Names.
{73176}{73214}The kind you used to run from.
{73218}{73295}Maybe I was afraid they'd run,|so I ran first.
{73415}{73506}Is this what you've wanted all along?|To be a name?
{73510}{73577}If you mean accomplish things,|have your opinions count...
{73581}{73659}- To have your jokes quoted.|- To have a sense of importance. You bet.
{73672}{73766}Is there more virtue in being a nonentity?|Is that why you're trying to keep me one?
{73770}{73843}Always belittling, carping at every|good thing that happens to me.
{73847}{73909}Will you stop jumping on those beds!
{74304}{74347}Daddy.
{74550}{74594}Would you like a cup of coffee?
{74636}{74667}I'd love one.
{74671}{74748}Can we jump just once more if we're|careful? We wanna make a pyramid.
{74752}{74815}- Yes, of course, Davie.|- It's okay. Come on, it's okay!
{75238}{75305}I'm really not trying to cut you down.
{75315}{75354}And I'm so proud of you.
{75358}{75410}I always have been.
{75438}{75479}Darling, I know.
{75483}{75547}We both said things we didn't mean.
{75655}{75699}Don't go.
{75712}{75787}If they broke any important bones,|they'll yell.
{75823}{75907}Darling, I didn't mean to be so selfish.
{75919}{76018}Of course it's fun for you,|being lion-hunted.
{76033}{76113}- Of course you want to stay.|- It could be fun for you too.
{76117}{76183}Meeting interesting people,|making new friends.
{76187}{76281}Darling, interesting people don't wanna|make friends with housewives.
{76285}{76371}I wish you wouldn't call yourself a|housewife. You're much more than that.
{76375}{76439}So is every other housewife.
{76463}{76540}Anyway, what matters right now is you.
{76545}{76609}You are becoming a very important man.
{76613}{76675}And I act as if it were|an inconvenience.
{76686}{76771}Nagging you, grizzling about|what I want.
{76775}{76819}I can't just ignore what you want.
{76823}{76875}Well, you should. It's all I deserve.
{76879}{76922}Now, let's not go overboard.
{76926}{77002}I wasn't being completely selfish.
{77006}{77081}I think the country would be|marvelous for the boys.
{77085}{77181}Him, poor thing. He's never even seen|a tree without a railing around it.
{77185}{77252}I honestly did think about you.|Really, I did.
{77256}{77367}I don't know how you work with|all of us on top of you every minute.
{77371}{77424}I could work at the office.
{77443}{77472}No.
{77476}{77587}The nicest part about being married to a|writing-type fellow is he's around a lot.
{77598}{77643}There I go, being selfish again.
{77647}{77703}Your work has to come first.
{77707}{77751}We all live on it.
{77755}{77812}Parasites, that's what we are.
{77816}{77859}All of us.
{77931}{77964}Kate.
{77978}{78044}You are using what are known as|feminine wiles on me.
{78048}{78080}You've never done that.
{78084}{78117}Larry!
{78121}{78188}And you have absolutely|no talent for it.
{78192}{78290}If you want to go to the country badly|enough to put on this nauseating act...
{78294}{78319}Okay, we go.
{78368}{78445}Only, what sort of a house|we're gonna find in three weeks...
{78449}{78543}...with very little money,|four small boys and one large dog...
{78547}{78606}...I just don't know.
{79043}{79081}How do you like it?
{79085}{79119}It's like out of {y:i}Ivanhoe.
{79123}{79158}It's much older than that.
{79162}{79212}How come it's so big?
{79224}{79291}Because we couldn't afford|anything smaller.
{79302}{79358}Come on, let's take a look around.
{79363}{79399}Come on.
{82090}{82191}Well, here I am, about to start|a long life as a commuter.
{82203}{82267}Listen to the kids out there.|They're having a ball.
{82271}{82378}I don't hear any happy sounds bubbling|out of him. Hey, Adam, say something.
{82382}{82430}Cokey-Cola.
{82434}{82513}Great. Probably take a whole year|to work him up to "daddy" again.
{82517}{82564}- Say "daddy."|- Don't you worry about Adam.
{82568}{82610}He'll be just fine.
{82614}{82665}The worst is over.
{82684}{82714}Honey?
{82718}{82765}Sit down a minute, will you?
{82769}{82857}- Let's talk before you go.|- Okay. It's just a minute.
{82861}{82923}I'll give him some soup and cornflakes|and get him down.
{82927}{82978}How about you?|Do you think the worst is over?
{82982}{83023}Hasn't even begun.
{83027}{83073}Come on, smiley.
{83079}{83111}Cheer up.
{83115}{83183}I'll let you scatter some cornflakes.
{83332}{83371}Yoo-hoo!
{83390}{83460}Go right on in.|Mom and Dad are in the living room.
{83464}{83501}Thank you.
{83540}{83615}I'm afraid we're the|"Welcome to Hooton" committee.
{83619}{83703}- Your children showed us in.|- Oh, please come in.
{83707}{83793}We're such a mess. I'm Kate Mackay.|This is my husband, Larry.
{83797}{83873}We know all about you. How do you do.|I'm Mrs. Hunter.
{83877}{83921}- Mrs. Hunter.|- This is Dr. Sprouk.
{83925}{83966}- How do you do.|- How do you do.
{83970}{84027}How do you do, Mrs. Mackay.|This is Dr. McQuarry.
{84031}{84087}- How do you do.|- Mrs. Mackay and Mr. Mackay.
{84091}{84127}Nice to meet you.
{84131}{84201}We just wanted to say hello|and bring you these.
{84205}{84261}And to put the bite on Mr. Mackay.
{84265}{84335}- Excuse me, are you a lady or a man?|- George!
{84339}{84462}I'm a veterinarian, sonny.|It's somewhere in-between.
{84486}{84529}That's very interesting.
{84533}{84583}Would you please take those|out to Maggie?
{84587}{84649}- What for?|- Be good. Go with George. You too.
{84653}{84711}Didn't even open my mouth. Boy.
{84715}{84795}She's not getting any more kisses|out of me in a hurry.
{84801}{84852}Aren't they cute.
{84872}{84952}- Won't you come in and sit down?|- We don't want to take your time.
{84956}{84999}- You wanted to ask Larry...|- Oh, yes.
{85003}{85058}For some help with our|local dramatic society...
{85062}{85129}...called, unfortunately,|the Hooton Holler Players.
{85133}{85167}Yes, isn't it?
{85171}{85215}We're starting our annual show...
{85219}{85292}...which involves a lot of homegrown|talent and a worthy cause.
{85296}{85355}Now to get to the pitch.|We need your help.
{85359}{85399}I see.
{85413}{85491}I'll give you my wife.|She just loves to join things.
{85495}{85547}- How nice.|- We'd be delighted to have her.
{85551}{85633}But what we really need|is a brand-new play.
{85637}{85715}- And we thought, with your contacts...|- I see, but I'm afraid...
{85719}{85818}How about a musical based on the first|two books of the Old Testament?
{85822}{85877}We'd like a musical,|but the Old Testament?
{85881}{85950}What's the matter, you got something|against the Bible?
{86007}{86116}- Larry, Hobo has to go out, right now.|- Yes, dear. Come, Hobo, dear.
{86157}{86208}He's very amusing.
{86215}{86268}I laugh almost all the time.
{86541}{86607}This house is turning that dog|into a nervous wreck.
{86611}{86703}Here's some tranquilizers. Give him|two a day, he won't care where he is.
{86707}{86767}- Thank you.|- Save a couple for me, honey.
{86776}{86860}We'd better go. We're probably|the dreadful end of a dreadful day.
{86864}{86905}- We loved it.|- Well, I do hope...
{86909}{86964}...you can persuade Mr. Mackay|to find something.
{86968}{87013}- I'll do my best.|- Bye, Mrs. Mackay.
{87017}{87062}- Goodbye, Mr. Mackay.|- Bye.
{87076}{87142}I read your reviews.
{87205}{87247}Yes.
{87275}{87313}- Bye.|- Bye.
{87317}{87355}Bye.
{87359}{87393}Hobo, come on.
{87397}{87458}It wouldn't have killed you|to find them a play.
{87462}{87515}Amateurs bore me. You find them a play.
{87519}{87603}- Well, don't worry. I intend to.|- That's just fine.
{87607}{87661}Now, if you'll excuse me...
{87665}{87723}...I have to go and play|with the grown-up people.
{87750}{87847}You know what he did with those|daisies? He ate them.
{87851}{87893}What?
{87903}{87953}- He ate them?|- You didn't tell me not to.
{87957}{88008}I didn't eat them all.|They were full of ants.
{88012}{88053}- George.|- Fastidious, ain't he?
{88057}{88126}Well, what's so funny?|I don't know what to do for him.
{88130}{88191}- Or to him.|- Let nature take its course.
{88195}{88267}Go on, George. Have some soup|and wash it down.
{88271}{88344}- Right away, now.|- Larry, you'll be late for your opening.
{88348}{88441}You mustn't do that. How would people|know what to think tomorrow?
{88445}{88523}I'm glad you said that. I was beginning|to feel guilty about leaving.
{88527}{88568}Good night.
{88702}{88799}The first time he goes off alone, and|you have to make sure he goes off mad.
{88803}{88904}I know. But he keeps making|those snide little cracks.
{88908}{89026}What do you expect when you drag him|70 miles from where he wants to be?
{89030}{89134}I dragged him? Mother, it wasn't just my|idea to move to the country, you know.
{89138}{89214}We've only planned it for 10 long years.
{89218}{89324}Besides, he needs to get away from|New York, and now, for his own good.
{89352}{89391}Don't worry.
{89399}{89479}He'll love it.|And he'll love this house too.
{89483}{89567}I'm gonna make this place so beautiful|he'll have to love it.
{89571}{89632}I wouldn't push him too far.
{89636}{89703}Just let him stop hating it.
{90843}{90879}Deborah Vaughn.
{90883}{90936}A no-actress type.
{90949}{91002}I thought you might be ill.
{91006}{91064}No, I was just sleepy.
{91068}{91138}Good of you not to give me a hotfoot|while you had the chance.
{91142}{91215}- We made up, remember?|- That was in public, remember?
{91219}{91307}Let's do it again. In private.
{91342}{91380}There.
{91399}{91461}Friends at last.
{91469}{91530}- Pals.|- Chums.
{91567}{91611}You know something, chum?
{91615}{91716}That slap I slapped you|did you a world of good.
{91735}{91821}You're much more attractive|since you turned into a louse.
{91835}{91895}I'm utterly impervious to flattery.
{91899}{91993}Still, I might buy you a cup of coffee|without loss of principle. Pete.
{92047}{92109}Where's Madame?
{92113}{92173}Alfred tells me you're never|without her.
{92177}{92219}That doesn't mean I'm on a leash.
{92223}{92291}Come, come. You're talking to Mother.
{92315}{92365}- Yes, Mr. Mackay?|- Pete, bring some coffee...
{92369}{92444}...and another wine glass, please.|Anything else you'd like?
{92448}{92500}Just a little careless chatter.
{92504}{92550}How's the missus?
{92554}{92599}She's fine.
{92607}{92667}And the four boys?
{92671}{92721}They're fine too.
{92731}{92779}- So is the dog.|- That's good.
{92783}{92819}- They're all fine.|- That's nice.
{92823}{92879}I'm catching a train at 1: 10.
{92883}{92967}I'm sorry. I thought you were|just settling in.
{93035}{93105}- A train to where?|- Hooton. On the Hudson.
{93109}{93191}We moved in there this morning.|Because I'm so lucky.
{93195}{93246}Well, well.
{93250}{93303}Isn't that interesting.
{93307}{93398}I never saw the leash yet that could|stretch from Hooton to here.
{93402}{93475}- Are you driving at something?|- Naturally.
{93479}{93535}I'm thinking of going...
{93639}{93680}...on the make for you.
{93715}{93771}Shock technique. Effective, isn't it?
{93775}{93853}- It's staggering, but why?|- The usual.
{93875}{93931}I like the way you look.
{93939}{93973}Since when?
{93977}{94044}Does it have to be retroactive?
{94064}{94110}Oh, no, chum.
{94114}{94217}If you think I'm kidding, you're wrong.
{94293}{94333}Embarrassed?
{94357}{94389}Why?
{94425}{94471}I like my wife.
{94488}{94539}What's that got to do with this?
{94651}{94723}Don't tell me you've got morals!
{94819}{94863}Well...
{94876}{94927}That's that.
{94949}{95015}Go to sleep. I won't bother you.
{96783}{96850}What's the matter, old man? What is it?
{96866}{96915}Okay, he's up!|Hurry up, Dad. Get dressed!
{96919}{96964}Can I start school tomorrow?
{96968}{97017}But can't we always...?
{97082}{97151}You'll have to pick me up a timetable|on your way to school.
{97155}{97191}- I have a timetable.|- All right.
{97195}{97268}Good morning, darling.|Fellas, stop pestering Daddy.
{97272}{97351}Now, come on, you can go on outside|and play. But keep clean.
{97355}{97411}Okay. You poor baby.
{97421}{97487}- What happened?|- What do you mean what happened?
{97491}{97561}- What do you mean?|- He's shaking again. What happened?
{97565}{97619}What do you mean...?|Let's not start that again.
{97623}{97743}I'd better give him another tranquilizer.|How come you were so late last night?
{97747}{97859}I fell asleep at Pete's and then|I ran into Deborah Vaughn.
{97882}{97927}- Come on, Hobo.|- She's a funny girl.
{97931}{97962}Know what she said?
{97966}{98035}Oh, no. You're gonna take this pill.|What'd she say?
{98039}{98135}- Maybe it just sounded funny.|- Take it. Take it. Take...
{98139}{98239}If that's the way you wanna act,|help yourself. Get dressed. We'll be late.
{98243}{98361}Oh, before I forget, your publisher called.|They want four chapters by next week.
{98365}{98435}- I'm nowhere near ready.|- The minute we get back, you can work.
{98439}{98471}The study's messy, but quiet.
{98485}{98547}- Where are we going?|- Darling, school.
{98551}{98619}We start the boys this morning.|They want both parents there.
{98623}{98704}You know, full family participation.|You know, the whole bit.
{98708}{98770}Mothers, fathers, uncles,|aunts, sisters.
{98774}{98851}Maggie, where's the baby?
{99067}{99137}- Stop it.|- I got a itch.
{99172}{99235}The second grade is normal|for George and Gabriel.
{99239}{99347}But in the fifth, the average age|is 10. David is only 9.
{99358}{99446}Well, in New York, they seemed|to think he was quite bright.
{99529}{99579}- David.|- What's the matter?
{99583}{99631}Yeah, what's the matter?
{99659}{99743}Miss Bonney, George and Gabriel|will go to Miss Johnson's room.
{99747}{99795}David goes to Mrs. Van Oesen.
{99799}{99872}In New York, we didn't have|any homework.
{99891}{99920}Well, now you know.
{99924}{99995}- On your way. With our best wishes.|- Come on, boys.
{99999}{100063}- Good luck, fellas.|- Have a good day. I'll pick you up.
{100067}{100139}Be good boys. Bye.
{100143}{100221}- Will you sit down for a moment, please?|- Yes, of course.
{100240}{100328}It is our policy to draw school|and home closer together.
{100332}{100456}Therefore, we ask our parents to|volunteer for at least one school activity.
{100460}{100550}Will it be convenient for you to supervise|an after-school play hour...
{100554}{100657}...on Thursdays, from 3 to 4:30?|- Yes. Perfectly convenient.
{100661}{100698}Good.
{100702}{100749}Now, as to you, Mr. Mackay.
{100753}{100825}No, I'm sorry. I don't think|I'm going to volunteer.
{100834}{100897}Mr. Mackay is very busy right now.
{100901}{100965}It's not that. I just don't agree|with the policy.
{100969}{101027}- Shall I go on?|- Please do.
{101034}{101131}Well, in my opinion, elementary|schooling, the main purpose of it is...
{101135}{101223}...to keep the children out of|the parents' hair, and vice versa.
{101227}{101311}Those hours, when the kids are away|at school, have, for generations...
{101315}{101359}...been sacred to American parents.
{101363}{101411}That is when they are free.
{101415}{101511}And I don't have the faintest intention|of giving up that freedom.
{101515}{101547}Furthermore, if you could...
{101551}{101654}Then he said it was moral blackmail,|and he wouldn't buy it.
{101658}{101721}Boy, what a fine first impression|we're making.
{101725}{101776}- I'd like to gag him.|- Kate!
{101811}{101859}Kate!
{101863}{101938}- Yes, dear?|- Kate, you've got to make them stop.
{101947}{102001}Make who stop what?
{102031}{102093}- The carpenters.|- Can't they work in another part today?
{102097}{102214}- Yes, but you'll want it quiet tomorrow.|- Plumber's here. Where do you want him?
{102218}{102303}- I'll be there in a minute.|- Get him a hammer while he's waiting.
{102811}{102851}Yes?
{102894}{102955}It's your darling Dr. McQuarry.
{102968}{103021}Good morning, Dr. McQuarry.
{103037}{103120}Oh, yes. Yes, I'd love to be involved.
{103124}{103223}Well, I can paint scenery|or make costumes or whatever you need.
{103245}{103341}Yes, I did some acting in college.|Not very much.
{103368}{103431}As a matter of fact, I wasn't too bad.
{103439}{103493}Anyway, I'd love to try out.
{103536}{103576}- The play.|- Keep me out of this.
{103580}{103645}I'm neither a playwright, an agent|nor a clubwoman!
{103649}{103704}I don't think that'll be necessary. Really.
{103708}{103767}You see, I have my own contacts|in the theater.
{103771}{103837}Suppose I see what I can do,|and I'll call you later.
{103841}{103886}All right?
{103896}{103927}You're very sweet.
{103931}{103968}Bye-bye.
{104031}{104083}You're very sweet too.
{104101}{104201}I'm sorry. I'm just panicked about work,|that's all.
{104205}{104238}I'm sorry.
{104343}{104380}Look...
{104398}{104499}...this place is gonna be Bedlam, U.S.A.|for at least another week. It has to be.
{104503}{104538}So I have an idea.
{104542}{104583}Why don't you go away.
{104598}{104638}Like where?
{104642}{104703}Like a big luxurious hotel|in New York...
{104707}{104775}...full of silence and room service.
{104830}{104910}Live like a king, work like a dog|and come home to {y:i}House Beautiful.
{104914}{104956}And no carpenters.
{104974}{105012}- What do you think?|- Wonderful.
{105016}{105067}But isn't it running out on you?
{105087}{105202}Well, if you won't get mad, I'll tell you|a secret. I'd pay someone to remove you.
{105219}{105292}- I'm being a pain, huh?|- The worst.
{105296}{105331}Really.
{105357}{105402}It's not that I don't love you...
{105406}{105454}...but when does the next train leave?
{105469}{105527}Mother's going into town,|and I have to go to Macy's.
{105531}{105632}So you go pack a bag, and I'll drive us|all in and myself back. How's that?
{105636}{105700}As I said, it's not that I don't|love you, but...
{105704}{105742}...bye.
{106076}{106107}Operator?
{106111}{106203}Operator, I'm calling Murray Hill 3-9970.|New York City.
{106207}{106299}Are you out of your mind,|sending him off alone?
{106309}{106381}Are you sure you have thought this out?
{106391}{106465}Alfred North, please.|Mrs. Mackay calling.
{106469}{106550}- Thank you. I'll wait.|- Are you sure you shouldn't review it?
{106567}{106647}I don't know you as well as I did|when you were a child.
{106651}{106739}But you were one of the dumbest|children I ever met.
{106758}{106828}A girl's best friend is her mother.
{106843}{106888}Hello? Alfred?
{106897}{106966}How are you, dear? Good.
{106970}{107025}Alfred, I have a favor to ask of you.
{107029}{107095}Yes. I'm looking for a play.|A new play for the...
{107099}{107166}Now, Kate, if I had anything good,|I'd do it myself.
{107170}{107219}Why don't you ask your husband.
{107223}{107331}He may be neither an agent, a playwright|nor a clubwoman, but he certainly...
{107335}{107374}Hold on a second.
{107388}{107431}Martha.
{107519}{107560}Martha, I want you to think back.
{107564}{107633}Way back to when we first|started producing.
{107637}{107706}Larry Mackay sent us a play, remember?
{107791}{107924}"{y:i}So Passion Dies.|A tragedy by Lawrence Mackay."
{107931}{108010}Sure, we still have a bunch of copies.|They're in the drop-dead file.
{108014}{108110}Get them. Kate,|I may have something for you.
{108116}{108189}Really? What kind of something?
{108208}{108242}Oh, all right.
{108246}{108285}Surprise me, then.
{108289}{108335}Well, if you like it, I like it.
{108339}{108396}Now, listen, Alfred,|there's one problem.
{108400}{108493}They want to start rehearsals right away,|so I'll have to get hold of it fast.
{108497}{108559}Well... Well, I'm coming into town today.
{108563}{108622}Look, if you're coming in anyway...
{108626}{108685}...how about a drink at the Colony?
{108691}{108731}Macy's?
{108852}{108922}I found it, Mrs. Mackay.|This one looks like you.
{108926}{108956}That's pretty.
{108960}{109021}Can't you see this|in a sea-foam-green room?
{109025}{109098}With an alabaster bowl|on a dark coffee table.
{109102}{109174}And for accent, one shining red apple.
{109178}{109239}Yes. Yes, I can see that.
{109253}{109342}If the kids ate the apple, all we'd have|is an alabaster bowl with an apple core.
{109346}{109418}- You could get a marble apple.|- They'd eat that too.
{109422}{109521}I just have to make up my mind here.|I think it's one of these two. Definitely.
{109620}{109720}Alfred, which of these two fabrics|do you like best?
{109724}{109767}I hate them both.
{109780}{109830}So do I.
{109866}{109995}Oh, hey. Mister? Mister? This is it.|This is it. I have to have it. Please.
{110022}{110069}I couldn't describe it,|but when I saw it...
{110073}{110127}I'll measure what you need,|charge and send it.
{110131}{110188}It's been a pleasure, Mrs. Mackay.|Thank you.
{110201}{110267}He's just afraid I'll change|my mind. Coward.
{110271}{110355}Alfred, the play! You're a dear.|What's that?
{110359}{110430}{y:i}Ghostly Music by Irving O'Reilly.|That sounds marvelous.
{110434}{110501}There's only one performance,|to make money for the hospital.
{110505}{110573}One performance may be enough.|Say, Kate...
{110577}{110640}...Larry's such a tearer-downer.|- Thanks.
{110644}{110695}- Don't let him read this.|- He won't be around.
{110699}{110754}Say, come down to garbage disposals|with me.
{110758}{110787}- All right.|- All right.
{110817}{110884}Larry's living here at The Plaza|till the house is ready.
{110888}{110957}Why don't you call him up.|It's time you two made up.
{110961}{111052}Not quite yet. Why not skip garbage|disposals and have a drink with me.
{111056}{111152}Haven't you heard? I'm no longer|a member of the cocktail-party set.
{111159}{111227}I'm the lady in Hooton|with a rich, full life.
{111244}{111292}Down, please.
{111349}{111399}Next car, please.
{111436}{111488}Down, please.
{111492}{111542}Oh, it's just wonderful.
{111546}{111623}And it isn't just getting a house ready|and the boys settled.
{111627}{111672}It's much more than that.
{111676}{111789}It's putting down roots in the community.|Making a niche for us. You know?
{111793}{111880}From now on, the Mackays|are really gonna belong somewhere.
{111945}{112010}While you're living the rich,|full life in Hooton...
{112014}{112083}...what's Larry doing at The Plaza?|- I sent him there.
{112087}{112193}As a matter of fact, I ordered him there.|It's the smartest thing I ever did.
{112245}{112304}Hooton, New York, 346.
{112471}{112565}Hello. Is Mrs. Mackay at the PTA,|the garden club, the dramatic society?
{112569}{112658}I am in none of those places.|I am in your study, mixing paint.
{112662}{112711}You can hang up now, Maggie.
{112735}{112871}A silly question. I'm mixing because|I didn't like the paint the painters mixed.
{112875}{112923}How are you, darling?
{112938}{112980}You didn't!
{113008}{113071}Three chapters in one week?|That's marvelous!
{113075}{113131}I'm proud of you.
{113178}{113235}- You what?|- I said, I miss you.
{113243}{113296}What do you mean,|when did that happen?
{113300}{113379}It happened when I typed the last word|in the third chapter.
{113391}{113456}Well, don't argue about it.|Just pop on the 11:30...
{113460}{113525}...and come right down,|have lunch with me at Sardi's.
{113537}{113575}That's my good girl.
{113991}{114055}Sweetheart. Come on.|Give Mommy her shoes.
{114083}{114116}That's a good boy.
{114154}{114187}Cookie.
{114191}{114223}No, darling.
{114227}{114306}Mommy's just gonna go into New York|and have lunch with Daddy.
{114310}{114359}And I'll be right back. Okay?
{114363}{114430}Okay? Okay.
{114434}{114507}Mrs. Mackay. Mrs. Mackay.
{114511}{114549}The upholsterers are here.
{114553}{114671}Open the material from Macy's and show|it to them, Maggie. I'll be right there.
{114707}{114759}Come on, my big boy.
{114867}{114940}Hobo, come on. Hobo.
{115085}{115132}How do you like that new material?
{115136}{115175}I always have.
{115179}{115219}What do you mean?
{115383}{115434}I knew I liked it the minute I saw it.
{115438}{115472}Maybe you can take it back.
{115476}{115535}No, no. I wouldn't dare.
{115555}{115607}We'll cover the chairs. The club chairs.
{115611}{115645}Okay.
{115652}{115744}Oh, for heaven's sake!|It was that idiot salesman.
{115748}{115828}He unnerved me.|Him and his alabaster apple.
{115832}{115904}Okay, lady. That'll be about|10 days on these.
{115908}{115951}- Three days.|- Oh, no.
{115955}{115997}Oh, please?
{116005}{116043}Five days.
{116047}{116104}Okay. Take it away, pushover.
{116108}{116148}And, thanks.
{116225}{116263}Hello?
{116267}{116314}This is she speaking.
{116327}{116404}What? I'll be right there.
{116418}{116484}They want me at school.|It's one of the boys.
{116500}{116550}- What is it?|- Now, control yourself.
{116554}{116599}- It's very simple to saw it off.|- Oh, no.
{116603}{116697}I'm sorry, Miss Yule, I've just never told|him not to put a chair on his head.
{116701}{116758}All right, clever, brace yourself.
{116762}{116831}- Hey!|- Shut up, stupid.
{116890}{116932}You want some crackers to nibble on...
{116936}{116985}...you shouldn't get plastered?|- No.
{117441}{117495}- Stood up?|- No.
{117504}{117575}You always have a martini|and an old-fashioned for lunch?
{117579}{117653}My wife. She probably missed her train.
{117662}{117764}Or maybe somebody told her that we|ran into each other last week.
{117768}{117839}I did. Didn't worry her at all.
{117845}{117896}Bless her stupid little heart.
{117900}{117988}There's nothing I like better|than an understanding wife.
{117994}{118056}And she's turned you loose|for a while...
{118060}{118130}...I hear from Alfred "Grapevine" North.
{118134}{118182}You know, I wish you'd cut this out.
{118186}{118277}Why should it bother you,|if I don't bother you?
{118281}{118335}- You don't.|- You're a liar.
{118339}{118460}- You just make me nervous, that's all.|- That'll do nicely for the time being.
{118575}{118632}You can relax now. I'm leaving.
{118636}{118683}I have a performance to give.
{118687}{118758}- You've been giving one.|- Just a warm-up for a cold critic.
{118762}{118839}I'm not cold. I'm just not available.
{118843}{118895}Don't be silly, sweetie.
{118899}{118971}Everyone's available who isn't dead.
{119141}{119175}Hello?
{119181}{119233}Oh, hello, Kate.
{119247}{119375}It's all right. Just thought you might've|called to say you'd changed your mind.
{119395}{119447}What? Which one?
{119451}{119481}George?
{119485}{119529}Is he all right?
{119544}{119596}Got his head caught in what?
{119653}{119756}As long as his brains are intact and you|come have dinner with me, I forgive you.
{119783}{119847}Skip the... Skip it. Skip the rehearsal.
{119861}{119925}Now, look, darling. Honestly, I can't.
{119933}{120042}But, Larry, I'm playing the lead, and if I|don't show up, there's no rehearsal.
{120046}{120117}David, stop it. Stop it. David.
{120135}{120199}Now, don't make me feel bad.
{120208}{120256}Will you call me tomorrow?
{120260}{120307}Early?
{120315}{120384}Because I love you, that's why. Dope.
{120819}{120850}Hey! Hey!
{121491}{121529}Kate?
{121539}{121607}Kate? Maggie?
{121675}{121712}Maggie?
{121750}{121788}Boys?
{122300}{122359}Operator, I know this sounds silly...
{122363}{122475}...but do you know where the|Hooton Dramatic Society rehearse?
{122479}{122541}Oh, that's... Would you put me...?
{122547}{122602}Well, how do you know|there's nobody there?
{122616}{122651}Oh, you're in the play.
{122655}{122695}I see.
{122718}{122747}Well...
{122751}{122877}...would you put me through|to the Hooton primary school, please?
{123013}{123044}Yeah?
{123048}{123100}Yeah, this is school.
{123175}{123251}It closes 3:00, school.
{123267}{123377}No, there isn't nobody here but me,|and I gotta go home now.
{123509}{123575}Okay, form your lines, now.|Nice and straight.
{123579}{123631}Girls here, boys here. Two and two.
{123635}{123687}Nice and straight. Get your partners.
{123691}{123750}Gabe, honey, give me the uke.
{123754}{123824}Now, straight. Nice and straight.|That's a boy.
{126464}{126511}Ridiculous waste of time...
{126531}{126595}Thank you. Thank you very much.
{126653}{126702}- Hi!|- Hi, Daddy! You gonna stay?
{126706}{126787}Well, darling, when did you get here?|What happened to your suit?
{126791}{126854}What a marvelous surprise.
{126858}{126914}Don't you have an opening tonight?|Say hi to Daddy.
{126918}{126987}I got here long ago,|when the century was young.
{126991}{127067}I had to climb in through a window,|which accounts for my suit.
{127071}{127151}It was wonderful for me, spending|the afternoon with a phone book...
{127155}{127195}...trying to find my wife.
{127199}{127295}And, yes, I do have an opening tonight,|to which I'm going, right now!
{127299}{127352}Someday, when you have|nothing better to do...
{127356}{127431}...you might try to explain|just where you've been all day!
{127435}{127474}Thank you very much!
{127603}{127675}I was having a rendezvous|with Rock Hudson!
{127681}{127824}Me, David, George, Gabriel,|Adam and Hobo. All of us!
{127921}{127971}- Hi.|- Hi, darling.
{127975}{128032}How did rehearsal go?
{128036}{128071}Fine.
{128124}{128215}- Larry call?|- No, he's mad. He won't call.
{128219}{128268}Why don't you call him.
{128415}{128459}What's the matter?
{128478}{128528}Ten years of not dancing.
{128532}{128595}Too much bone in my bones.
{128599}{128689}- How'd I get older than you?|- No character, that's why.
{128693}{128765}Hey, guess who's on television. Daddy!
{128780}{128810}Daddy?
{128815}{128867}{y:i}You children are double-crossing me.
{128871}{128984}{y:i}I try to bring together impossible|{y:i}interviews, enemies, feuders.
{128988}{129029}{y:i}Uur feuding days are over.
{129035}{129074}{y:i}Yes, like in the movies.
{129087}{129141}{y:i}Hate has turned to love.
{129151}{129212}{y:i}Well, let's say it's turned to friendship.
{129228}{129288}{y:i}My friend is a cautious man...
{129293}{129402}{y:i}... with an unnatural fear|{y:i}of coffeehouses and guitars.
{129467}{129523}{y:i}That's a private joke.
{129650}{129698}- Very funny.|- We can see him anytime.
{129702}{129769}- I wanna see {y:i}Frankenstein.|- Is there a difference?
{129779}{129852}Sneaking out with that two-bit vamp.
{129856}{129943}- Sneaking out? On a TV screen?|- He's been seeing her off that screen.
{129953}{130043}- He just happened to run into Deborah.|- As long as he tells you about it.
{130047}{130146}An honest truck driver cheats on his wife,|he's polite enough to keep it to himself.
{130150}{130255}But the eggheads, the diploma boys,|they tell you everything.
{130259}{130311}That way, if you're jealous,|you're wrong.
{130315}{130375}- Listen to me.|- Please don't give me that...
{130379}{130423}..."you made him move" bit.
{130427}{130503}I have no intention of beating|a dead horse.
{130507}{130551}If you mean me, thanks.
{130555}{130626}Kate Robinson, you stop being so fresh.
{130630}{130663}I'm sorry.
{130667}{130738}Up to now, I don't think anything|has happened between Larry...
{130742}{130798}...and that nasty-looking girl.
{130805}{130856}She is nasty-looking, isn't she?
{130860}{130932}But if you go on neglecting him,|something will happen.
{130936}{130992}Did you see the dress she had on?
{130996}{131030}Falsies.
{131034}{131093}He doesn't know it. I hope.
{131103}{131174}Did you see her makeup, her hair?
{131187}{131286}What am I supposed to do? Wear a|black-lace negligee to the supermarket?
{131290}{131352}No, that is not|what you're supposed to do.
{131356}{131462}Here's what you're supposed to do. Pull|yourself together. Get this house in order.
{131466}{131571}Get on the phone, call Larry. Tell him you|miss him, love him, want him home.
{131575}{131693}I've been married to Larry for 10 years.|If I have to start playing tricks...
{131697}{131747}What do you mean, tricks?
{131751}{131807}Don't you miss him? Don't you love him?
{131811}{131862}Don't you want him to come home?
{132559}{132630}This is a strange place for you|to choose.
{132634}{132711}It's a place, like all the others.
{132718}{132761}Full of strangers.
{132765}{132804}You really do have the blues.
{132808}{132862}What's the matter? Do you want to say?
{132882}{132927}Just sad.
{132931}{132989}Been adding up my life.
{132993}{133071}It should add up very well.|You're awfully successful.
{133095}{133135}That's what I wanted.
{133139}{133170}Rake in the loot.
{133191}{133296}Like Helen Hayes,|have the theaters named after her.
{133317}{133387}All of a sudden, it doesn't seem enough.
{133410}{133450}I go to the theater.
{133454}{133483}I work.
{133487}{133599}I sit over a drink or a cup of coffee|because I don't wanna go home.
{133603}{133648}And then I go home...
{133652}{133704}...and there's nothing there.
{133708}{133760}I'm alone.
{133776}{133839}My choice, of course, but...
{133864}{133901}...well...
{133905}{133968}...we don't always like|what we've chosen.
{133972}{134040}I always think of you|at big, gay, noisy parties...
{134044}{134103}...surrounded by big, gay, noisy people.
{134115}{134164}Good act, isn't it?
{134171}{134209}So is this one.
{134213}{134284}Sad music, guitars,|the dark coffeehouse...
{134288}{134343}...beautiful woman, glamorous,|successful...
{134347}{134403}...and lonely, lonely, lonely.
{134407}{134463}- Oh, Deborah.|- Well, this one isn't polished yet.
{134467}{134597}I mean, it's the first time I've tried it.|And it almost got you. Admit. Almost.
{134601}{134703}Way back in the section where you|went home and there was nobody there.
{134722}{134799}I think I'll try a whole new tack|next time.
{134813}{134871}Why don't you meet me, say, Friday.
{134875}{134921}Just to see what I can come up with.
{134949}{135010}No, I think I'll go up to Hooton instead.
{135050}{135097}Run, sheep, run.
{135101}{135159}And live to fight another day.
{135438}{135475}- Maggie.|- She'll kill herself.
{135479}{135556}- Why?|- You're not supposed to be here till 7.
{135560}{135643}Hey! Darned if it isn't {y:i}House Beautiful.
{135647}{135691}And Maggie Beautiful.
{135707}{135765}- Wait till you see your study.|- Yeah?
{135771}{135810}Well, well.
{135814}{135887}You know what she got you?|An electric pencil sharpener.
{135891}{135978}- There'll be boiled lobster for dinner.|- She hates boiled lobster.
{135982}{136011}I know.
{136015}{136091}All the same, there's something missing.|The patter of lots of feet.
{136095}{136157}Not to mention|the click of Hobo's toenails.
{136162}{136199}Where is everyone?
{136240}{136286}- It's beautiful.|- Isn't it pretty?
{136290}{136321}Really beautiful.
{136325}{136405}The missus sent Hobo and the boys|home with Grandma.
{136409}{136515}She thought it was about time that you|had a weekend alone, the both of you.
{136519}{136545}Where is she?
{136554}{136606}At a rehearsal. Now, don't get excited.
{136610}{136691}It was supposed to be tonight, but|she told them unless they switched...
{136695}{136753}...and she was finished by 7,|she wouldn't be there.
{136757}{136831}I'll get the ice out, make you a drink.|And you look around.
{136835}{136880}No. I'll drop in at the rehearsal.
{136884}{136923}- That'll be nice.|- Where is it?
{136927}{136989}You go down the road|and turn right at the big elm.
{136993}{137035}You can't miss the high school.
{139363}{139402}Applause.
{139406}{139443}Continue.
{139458}{139506}Drinks for everybody.
{139510}{139548}- On Nerissa.|- That's wonderful.
{139552}{139591}Enjoy yourselves.
{139595}{139677}Norman, is it...? Norman?
{139681}{139751}- Dr. McQuarry?|- Dr. McQuarry?
{139762}{139798}I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
{139802}{139854}I should be drummed out|of the company.
{139876}{139977}Forgive me, Kate. My boys' confirmation|class was packed with young devils.
{139981}{140052}Wait till my David's old enough.|You'll really have trouble.
{140056}{140097}Norman.
{140101}{140145}Norman, is it really you?
{140149}{140222}Yes, Nerissa, it is I.
{140226}{140273}But what are you doing here?
{140277}{140315}This is such a surprise.
{140331}{140380}A happy surprise, Nerissa?
{140384}{140430}Tell me that it is a happy surprise.
{140453}{140568}Norman, I have dreamed so many times|of our meeting again.
{140575}{140619}But not like this.
{140623}{140678}Not in this evil place.
{140703}{140781}What matter where? I have found you.
{140785}{140823}No, Norman.
{140832}{140903}- I have changed.|- Not to me.
{140978}{141076}Between the girl I was|and the woman I am...
{141080}{141144}...stretch too many days, my dear.
{141148}{141195}Too many nights.
{141236}{141287}I care nothing for your yesterdays...
{141303}{141373}...so long as your tomorrows|belong to me.
{141377}{141416}Stop that!
{141440}{141515}- What do you think you're doing?|- Larry.
{141519}{141551}It's just make-believe.
{141555}{141629}How dare you give them this play|without asking my permission.
{141633}{141667}Your permission?
{141671}{141721}- We have Irving O'Reilly's permission.|- Who?
{141725}{141787}- What's he got to do with my play?|- Your play?
{141791}{141878}- Larry, you've never written a play.|- Yes, I have. And this is it.
{141882}{141971}Here it is, in black and white.|{y:i}Ghostly Music by Irving O'Reilly.
{141975}{142048}Can't you see this is a new title page|just tacked on?
{142052}{142135}Kate, the title of this play is|{y:i}So Passion Dies.
{142139}{142209}I wrote it when I was in college.|I wanna know how you got it.
{142226}{142267}I got it...
{142287}{142332}You got it from Alfred North!
{142336}{142371}That dirty double...!
{142375}{142463}He said he was gonna pay me back,|but to trick you into joining him...
{142467}{142501}You are mixing me up.
{142505}{142574}How does our doing it pay you back|if your name isn't on it?
{142578}{142627}Is it possible he meant it|as a nice surprise?
{142631}{142661}It is not possible.
{142665}{142719}This is a trap,|and I don't intend to fall into it.
{142723}{142790}- Sorry. I cannot give you permission.|- Mr. Mackay.
{142794}{142864}The performance is next Friday.|It's a benefit for a hospital.
{142868}{142945}And we're sold-out.|Oh, you're wrong about Mr. North.
{142949}{143032}Why, he sold 78 tickets for us.|And to important people too.
{143036}{143111}Actors, writers, directors.|Friends of yours, probably.
{143115}{143171}There it is. Now do you get it?
{143175}{143267}Do you think North's not gonna tell|these friends of mine whose play it is?
{143271}{143339}If you'll forgive a colloquialism,|so what?
{143355}{143445}It's a very bad play, Dr. McQuarry.|Though maybe you haven't noticed.
{143449}{143548}I noticed. We all did. But fortunately,|it was so bad it was funny.
{143552}{143608}And Dr. Sprouk wrote us|some lovely songs.
{143612}{143691}And Dr. McQuarry rewrote the play|and turned it into a comedy.
{143695}{143729}That's funny already.
{143733}{143783}I'm pleased the doctors are so talented.
{143787}{143871}Now they can write a new play,|because you're not gonna do this one.
{143875}{143913}Oh, Mr. Mackay.
{143917}{143988}- I've lost half my business.|- I can't believe it.
{143992}{144049}Mr. Mackay,|you can't leave us like this.
{144100}{144163}Please. I know how you feel.
{144183}{144227}I'm as miserable as you are,|believe me.
{144231}{144343}But you can't just leave them like this.|You don't know what it means to them.
{144347}{144381}They've worked their heads off.
{144385}{144451}They've given of their time,|neglected their businesses.
{144455}{144519}It's terribly important to them.|We can't do this.
{144523}{144568}What do you mean we can't? I can.
{144572}{144659}I'm not gonna look like an idiot|to prevent people I don't care about...
{144663}{144715}...from a rather silly disappointment.
{144719}{144766}Larry, what's happened to you?
{144787}{144851}Other people's feelings used to be|important to you.
{144855}{144915}Before you got so important.
{144919}{144964}Well, let me tell you something.
{144968}{145035}The bigger you're getting,|the smaller you're getting.
{145039}{145115}It's hardly the time for critical analysis|of my character.
{145119}{145188}It won't take long.|It's not much of a character.
{145223}{145275}You're getting to be a mean man, Larry.
{145287}{145345}Almost as mean as your reviews.
{145349}{145400}Well, I think Alfred was right.
{145404}{145463}It might do you some good|if people did laugh at you.
{145467}{145531}They're not gonna have the chance.|It's still my play.
{145535}{145647}- I haven't given you permission to do it.|- You have every right to take it back.
{145651}{145765}Well, you go ahead. But if you do,|I'll never forgive you.
{145807}{145884}If you cared anything about me,|you couldn't say that.
{145928}{146057}I care a great deal about you,|and I do say it.
{146150}{146259}I wouldn't dream of coming between you|and the Hooton Holler Players.
{146263}{146328}Such as it is, the play is yours.
{146579}{146648}A kid at school says there's hugging|and kissing in that show.
{146652}{146741}Mom and the minister. I don't think|that's nice for a married lady.
{146745}{146808}Well, it's just|for one performance, fellas.
{146825}{146879}Oh, and how I wish it weren't tonight.
{146897}{146962}- What's that clock say, Mag, 6: 15?|- Yes, ma'am.
{146979}{147038}- Better get going.|- Do you need any help?
{147042}{147123}I have everything at the auditorium.|I'll come in before I leave.
{147127}{147239}Right. All right, clean up that stew, and|there'll be chocolate cake for everyone.
{147243}{147294}- Oh, boy.|- Hey, can Hobo have some?
{147298}{147339}No. He's liable to get worms.
{147343}{147390}He might like them.
{147394}{147423}Yeah.
{147625}{147661}Hi, Katie.
{147665}{147707}Oh, Alfred.
{147730}{147812}He calls the boys every day|and doesn't even ask for me.
{147816}{147895}If he feels this way, how will he feel|when everyone's laughing at him?
{147899}{147936}Come on.
{147967}{148017}No one's going to laugh at him.
{148038}{148090}He beat everyone to the punch, Kate.
{148116}{148202}Reviewed the show himself,|and he's come out smelling like a rose.
{148206}{148313}We haven't even done it yet. He only|saw five minutes of the rehearsal.
{148317}{148356}He says that's all he needed.
{148360}{148417}That the Hooton Players are charming...
{148421}{148508}...particularly their leading lady.|- I wish I were dead.
{148512}{148564}They're wasting time|on a 20-year-old play...
{148568}{148632}...written by a man with no talent|for writing plays.
{148636}{148683}Namely, himself.
{148727}{148785}"It was rejected by every|Broadway producer...
{148789}{148877}...in terms so outraged that I determined|never to write another one...
{148881}{148963}...thus saving myself years of futile|effort and frustration."
{148983}{149051}Here comes the cherry|on the banana split.
{149055}{149131}"I have been under attack of late|by my near and dear...
{149135}{149196}...for what they consider my cruelty|as a critic.
{149200}{149294}But this glimpse of my past monstrosity|has made me so grateful...
{149298}{149399}...to those I once thought cruel|that I shall go on yelling 'Tripe'...
{149403}{149455}...whenever tripe is served."
{149471}{149551}Well, we certainly taught him a lesson.
{149579}{149692}This whole nonsensical thing is costing|me everything important in my life.
{149747}{149807}Do you think he'll come|to the performance?
{149845}{149912}"Tonight, when the curtain rises on|{y:i}So Passion Dies...
{149916}{149975}...I shall be far, far away.
{149979}{150095}And, dear reader, may I wish you|the same good fortune."
{150245}{150336}- What's the matter with everybody?|- Something bugging you, Mr. Mackay?
{150340}{150445}Have you ever been in a situation where|you're right and everybody is wrong...
{150449}{150495}...but you just can't get them to see it?
{150499}{150623}Every day of my life. With my wife,|my kids, the busboys, everybody.
{150632}{150695}Better eat your steak before it cools off.
{150756}{150821}You can get awful lonesome being right.
{150889}{150922}Thank you.
{151049}{151093}I've been trying to locate you all day.
{151097}{151155}- Finally I called the pet shop and...|- Joe!
{151159}{151232}Why didn't you tell me it was you?|Come on in.
{151236}{151315}- Hey. I'm pleased to see you. Sit down.|- Oh, thanks.
{151319}{151387}- Let me get you a drink.|- I'm just gonna stay a minute.
{151391}{151447}- I figured I owed you an apology.|- What for?
{151451}{151535}What I've been thinking about you|since the day you made fun of my play.
{151539}{151632}Then I read the column you wrote about|your own play, and I saw I was wrong.
{151636}{151703}You see, it's sort of hard for me,|giving up writing.
{151707}{151790}- Ever since I was a kid, the one thing l...|- What do you mean?
{151794}{151854}You stopped writing|because of something I said?
{151858}{151961}Oh, sure. You see, where I was off was|blaming you instead of blaming myself...
{151965}{151998}...for not having talent.
{152002}{152099}- Actually, you were doing me a favor.|- Joe, you're crazy. You do have talent.
{152103}{152145}Are you kidding? Remember me?
{152149}{152235}I'm the genius who made Abraham|sound like the guy ordering a sandwich.
{152239}{152348}Don't you understand? You didn't give|me a chance. You flew off the handle...
{152352}{152411}Sit right there. I wanna talk to you.
{152495}{152575}I hate people who drop in|without calling, don't you?
{152627}{152716}- Well, don't let me overexcite you.|- Please, come in.
{152720}{152798}I just came by to tell you|your column was wonderful.
{152813}{152843}Hello.
{152847}{152913}Oh, I'm sorry. Miss Deborah Vaughn,|Joe Positano.
{152917}{152963}How do you do, Miss Vaughn?
{152967}{153053}Joe was a very talented writer,|till I convinced him he should stop.
{153057}{153095}Oh, he's kidding.
{153122}{153180}Some column, wasn't it?
{153235}{153333}"I shall yell 'Tripe'|whenever tripe is served."
{153379}{153452}That's a declaration of war, chum.
{153456}{153487}From now on...
{153491}{153571}...whenever you walk into a theater,|they're gonna shiver and shake.
{153575}{153638}I don't want anyone to shiver and shake.|I love theater.
{153642}{153693}This boy doesn't read his own reviews.
{153710}{153760}- Even I'll admit...|- Thank you.
{153764}{153848}...since you turned mean, people started|taking an interest in you.
{153852}{153920}I've never turned mean.|Nobody thinks I'm mean.
{153924}{153962}Except my wife.
{153966}{154045}Well, she can't always be wrong.
{154051}{154109}- I'll get it. I gotta go.|- Stay there. I wanna talk.
{154113}{154161}- But I haven't had supper yet.|- Eat mine.
{154208}{154262}I guess you thought|I was seeing the show.
{154266}{154334}I told Kate she was wrong|not to withdraw it.
{154338}{154390}I've washed my hands...|Well, for heaven's sake.
{154394}{154457}- Evening, Mrs. Robinson.|- I haven't seen you for...
{154461}{154529}Miss Deborah Vaughn.|Miss Suzie is my mother-in-law.
{154543}{154626}- How do you do.|- I didn't get here first. Joe did.
{154630}{154690}As long as you don't leave last.
{154694}{154834}Larry, I have something to tell you.|Would you excuse us, please?
{154988}{155033}Come on, sit down.
{155042}{155104}Kate just called me.|That's why I came over.
{155108}{155138}She was blubbering.
{155142}{155184}- Oh, no.|- Oh, yes, she was.
{155188}{155290}- Oh, poor baby. I must call her.|- That's exactly what you mustn't do!
{155294}{155402}Larry, don't go near that girl|until she calls you and apologizes.
{155406}{155468}But I don't want her to be unhappy.|I love her.
{155472}{155513}Oh, loving her is one thing.
{155517}{155579}Letting her think she's intelligent|is another.
{155583}{155625}And look where it's got you.
{155629}{155750}Into a house you don't want and a lot|of ridiculous interference in your career.
{155754}{155808}Well, she's good and scared now.
{155812}{155921}And that's the way you keep her,|right under your thumb.
{155925}{156007}Think I ought to make her say,|"{y:i}Heil, Larry," first thing every morning?
{156011}{156047}Wouldn't do a bit of harm.
{156055}{156151}You've turned into a strong man|in the past few months. Don't stop.
{156171}{156220}I'm proud of you.
{156224}{156282}I'm proud of me too.
{156286}{156363}It's just wonderful to have everybody|scared of me.
{156367}{156453}One clever word from me,|and a new writing talent gives up.
{156457}{156539}If I play my cards right, they may not|even bother to open plays anymore.
{156543}{156585}That's how scary I am.
{156589}{156700}And to make my own wife crawl?|That would be the final triumph.
{156708}{156759}It's intoxicating, all this power.
{156763}{156861}Oh, darling, you're exaggerating|because you're upset.
{156920}{156959}I should be.
{156981}{157035}If it's a play you've got,|I'm looking for one.
{157039}{157087}Oh, I got one, but it's lousy.
{157091}{157152}I may like it. I have terrible taste.
{157463}{157504}We're going up, sir.
{157612}{157656}I was just coming home.
{157673}{157750}Oh, Larry, were you?
{157759}{157799}Pardon me.
{157803}{157851}Pardon me, please.
{157887}{157958}It was my fault. Everything.
{157962}{158014}No. Don't you say that. It was not.
{158018}{158071}And anyway, now it doesn't...
{158091}{158123}Matter?
{158147}{158211}Eleven out. Down, please.
{158299}{158335}How was the play?
{158339}{158383}They liked it.
{158395}{158491}- Honey, we'll sell the house.|- No, I love it. I love the house.
{158516}{158588}- Darling, I'll be so different.|- No!
{158621}{158666}I beg your pardon!

NARRATOR: And it came to pass that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be taxed, and all went to be taxed, everyone, to his own city, for to disobey the Roman emperor meant certain death.
Oh, there were young people and old people.
There were the famous and mighty, and some not yet known, but whose names would eventually linger and be revered for all time.
There were good people who could ill afford the cruel tax about to be imposed upon them, and there were others.
And there were others.
Observe, Ali, the little drummer boy Aaron.
Are those animals dancing, Ben haramed?
BEN: They certainly are.
Faster, old friends. Faster.
You, samson, smile.
Hee-haw!
And you, bimbaba, be lighter, happier.
Baa!
Baa!
Oh, Joshua, you can do better.
[BRAYING]
[BRAYING]
Oh, with this marvel in my show caravan,
I will be as rich as Solomon.
But it is said
Aaron dislikes all humans.
He will not join us willingly.
BEN: Fool! Why do you think we brought the rope?
Ah!
Ah!
Let me go! Do you hear me!
Let me go!
Let me go!
Get the camel!
Get the camel!
BEN: Ah! The donkey, too, fool!
BEN: Ah! The donkey, too, fool!
The lamb, you oaf!
Grab the lamb!
How? I have only two hands!
Stop concerning yourself with details!
Do it!
Do it!
Drummer boy, you may not believe me, but this is the luckiest day of your life.
But this is the luckiest day of your life.

NARRATOR: The little drummer boy Aaron fought Ben haramed and Ali with all his might.
He most definitely did not want to join the showman's caravan, a journey into the crowded city,
FOR IT WAS TRUE:
Aaron hated people...
All people.
No! No! I won't go with you!
Stop struggling, boy!
There is money to be made.
We can be rich!
While those taxpayers are waiting to be counted, they will grow bored.
They will crave the entertainment which only I...
Ben haramed, king of the desert showmen... and of course you, too, can provide.
But I do not want to go near that mob.
I hate people! All people!
Do you think ilovepeople?
What a beautiful world it would be without people.
But, alas, one must exist with people.
And indeed, it is better to be crowded and rich...
Than crowded... And poor.
Than crowded... And poor.

NARRATOR: Oh, Ben haramed was a wily old desert jackal.
Only he could have talked Aaron into visiting the crowded city.
For you see, Aaron truly did hate all people.
Now, it wasn't always this way, for Aaron was once a happy farm lad, the son of a Shepherd.
Father! Mother!
Father! Mother!
And why this exceptional greeting today, my son?
Oh, no reason.
Happy Birthday, Aaron.
Oh, father! Mother!
Did you bring me something?
I don't suppose...
This would interest you, young man?
A drum!
My very own drum! Oh, father!
Try it out, Aaron!
NARRATOR: And perhaps because it was a gift of love, the drum had an almost magical quality.
And the animals, when they heard it, began to dance to its sound.
And the animals, when they heard it, began to dance to its sound.
But Aaron's happiness was to end all too soon, for one night, bandits of the desert attacked.
For one night, bandits of the desert attacked.
What's going on out there?
Father!
You must run, my son. Escape!
But... run!
But... run!
NARRATOR: They burned the farm and took the sheep, and Aaron's happy life had changed forever.
And so, Aaron roamed the land a lonely orphan, his only friends 3 of the farm animals who had escaped.
He vowed to hate all humans for what they had done to his family, and he kept that vow.
And he kept that vow.
BEN: Ah, Jerusalem at last.
Here we shall make our fortune.
AARON: All these people!
Aha! The rest of my show caravan.
Hello! Hello!
Jameel and mesaal!
Jameel and mesaal!
Set up our performing carpets, and let us be on with the show.
And let us be on with the show.
[HORN]
[HORN]
Ladies and gentlemen!
Fellow taxpayers!
The day need not be all gloomy.
For I, Ben haramed, king of the desert showmen, have brought at great expense direct from the palace of the emperor of China, the toast of royalty, mesaal and jameel, tumblers extraordinary!
Hup! Hup!
Hup! Hup!
Wonderful, wonderful!
Perhaps you will show your appreciation for such a performance.
For such a performance.
Philistine!
And now, let's move it right along with Ali of Arabia, greatest juggler under the stars.
Greatest juggler under the stars.
Boy, you perform next.
The crowd is restless.
You must appease them.
Are you ready?
I'm ready.
No, no. Smile. Smile!
See, only a smile pleases the crowd.
Smile. Smile!
I cannot.
Not at... Them.
You stubborn little fool!
Then wear a painted one.
There. That's better.
When do I go on?
Now, before the dope juggles me out of my life savings!
Now, before the dope juggles me out of my life savings!

More! More!
More! More!
You heard them! More! More!
Don't let them get away before I pass the hat!
NARRATOR: But as Aaron looked at the faces of the cheering mob, a great rage rose up inside him.
How dare they laugh and be happy after what their kind did to his family!
Stop! Quiet!
I hate you all for what you did!
You're all preying thieves and bandits and knaves and... and knaves and... run for it!
NARRATOR: And so, the troupe was chased out of Jerusalem by the mob.
BEN: Boy, you shall pay for this indignity.
Ben haramed! Look!
Ben haramed! Look!
BEN: By the hounds of heaven, it is the caravan...
Of a king! We're in luck!
Can I believe my luck?
Two kings!
Hold me up! Three!
Three kings!
Three kings!
NARRATOR: And behold, there came wise men from the east, three kings of the orient, and lo, the star which they saw went before them.
Went before them.
Yes, it was the star of Bethlehem which shone so brightly and graced the lonely darkening desert with its silver light.
But the little troupe did not see the star's beauty, for the souls of Ben haramed and
Ali were too filled with greed and the heart of Aaron too overflowing with hatred to take any note of the wonder just above them.
Now you listen, drummer boy.
If you give this one performance, half the money shall be yours.
Then you are free.
NARRATOR: Aaron agreed, only because he knew that with the kings' money, he would be free to go his own way and never again have to trouble himself with humans.
AND SO THEY APPROACHED
THE THREE KINGS:
Melchior, caspar, and balthazar.
'Tis night. We must break camp.
And swiftly!
The star waits not for us.
Strike the tents!
Pack the camels!
Strike the tents!
Pack the camels!
No! Don't go!
We just got here!
Halt! Out of my way!
We must perform!
Down, knave! Down!
Ben haramed... A knave?
Ben haramed... A knave?
I am crushed.
Lower your Spears.
These desert vagabonds seem to mean us no harm.
Why do you come to us?
We are a troupe of players, your majesty... uh, majesties.
We have no time for making merry, as you see.
We break camp, and... well, that's ridiculous.
Begging your pardon.
Nobody travels the desert by night!
We do...
For we follow the star.
For we follow the star.
BEN: How very... Convenient.
But, uh...
Enough.
Begone.
Now, to resume our journey.
Now, to resume our journey.
So close.
My fortune was so close!
And see what they load on the camels, great one.
Gold!
Oh, it's too painful.
[MOANING]
AND MORE VALUABLE
EVEN THAN GOLD:
The precious eastern resins frankincense and myrrh.
Frankincense and myrrh.
She is too weak to go on, your majesties.
Poor creature.
She has been weakened by the long journey.
Have we no extra beasts?
All are laden, almost beyond their strength.
MELCHIOR: Wait!
Did that player not own a camel?
Perhaps he would sell it.
No!
No!
You strike a hard bargain, player.
I've had a hard life.
CASPAR: Now load the beast, and let us be on our way.
And let us be on our way.
Gold. Ah.
I adore the feel of it, the weight of it, the look of it.
Ahh.
Ahh.
Your share.
I don't want it!
I don't want any part of you!
Come, samson, baba.
We must find our old comrade.
No!
BEN: Let him go!
We're done with him!
Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha!
NARRATOR: Aaron climbed the tallest hill he could find, but the royal caravan was nowhere in sight.
But the royal caravan was nowhere in sight.
Baa!
What is it, baba?
Samson?
Samson?
The star?
Yes.
The kings were following that star.
If we follow it, we are sure to catch up with them.
Come, quickly!
NARRATOR: And so they followed the gleaming star, little realizing where it was leading them.
CHORUS:
♪♪ you can hear the music ♪ ♪
♪ ♪ If you listen with your heart ♪ ♪
♪ ♪ One star in the night ♪ ♪
♪ ♪ Shone on Bethlehem... ♪ ♪
AARON: The town of Bethlehem.
NARRATOR: And as Aaron glanced back out over the countryside, he saw what seemed to be a gentle army of poor Shepherds, all of them being led toward the tiny town.
Why... They're all following the same star.
Why... They're all following the same star.
[CHOIR CONTINUES]
[CHOIR CONTINUES]
♪ ♪ One star in the night ♪ ♪
Look, samson! Baba!
By that old stable up ahead.
See?
[CHOIR CONTINUES SINGING]
[CHOIR CONTINUES SINGING]
The royal caravan!
We found it!
See, there is old Joshua!
Joshua!
NARRATOR: Their hearts were so full of joy that they did not look where they were going.
Suddenly, something came careening out of the darkness.
DRIVER: Out of my way, ragamuffin!
Baba!
Baba!
Oh, baba, you mustn't die! You mustn't!
Who could help me?
Who could help me?
Yes. The kings.
The kings are wise.
They will be able to save baba.
They will be able to save baba.
Please, I've got to get inside to see the kings!
You must let me through!
NARRATOR: And when Aaron came to the entrance of the stable, he could hardly believe what he saw.
He could hardly believe what he saw.
And she brought forth her firstborn son and wrapped him in swaddling clothes and laid him in a manger because there was no room for them in the inn.
Oh, your majesty!
You must... shh.
You must... shh.
Oh. The player boy.
My lamb has been injured.
You must save him.
He is near death.
Oh, lad, there is nothing I can do.
But... But you're a king!
A mortal king only.
But... There is a king among kings who would save your little friend.
The babe?
But I do not understand.
CASPAR: It is not necessary that you understand. Go to him.
But... I...
I have no gift to bring.
Go. Look upon the newborn king.

NARRATOR: And as Aaron looked at the babe, he thought it was the most beautiful sight he had ever seen.
AARON: And yet, there is something more about him...
So much more.
Your gift, little drummer boy, given out of the simple desperation of a pure love, is the one favored above all.
See?
NARRATOR: Aaron's heart was filled with joy and love, and he knew at last that the hate he had carried there was wrong, as all hatred will ever be wrong.
For more powerful, more beautiful by far than all the eons of sadness and cruelty and desolation which have come before was that one tiny, crystalline second of laughter.
Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.
For they shall see God.

While the city sleeps
Every night he creeps
Just surveyin' his domain
He roams around like he owns the town
He's the king

He knows every trick
Doesn't miss a lick
When it comes to keepin' fat
Some city slicker
No one is quicker

That darn cat
Every nook and cranny
And garbage can he inspects

Nose like a Geiger
Oh, what a tiger is

He's a sly old codger
An artful dodger
A scrounger unsurpassed

Hey, what do you say, fella?
Hey, you're taking my food, huh?
[Chuckling]
Iggy.
- What kept you?
- The lousy buses.
- Where'd you leave the car?
- Outside of Fresno, Route 99.
All right. Okay. They found it.
- The scan came in on the radio.
- What'd I tell you?
The fuzz'll fall for the whole deal, hook, line and sinker.
Maybe. We've got the federal fuzz on us this time.
So what? Who cares?
Wait till they pick up them hot 20s
I've been dropping off all the way up the valley.
They're gonna lose their minds.
Look at us, livin' in this solid pad, a block and a half away from where we pulled the job.
What about them headlines?
We're big news.
Front page, every one of them...
- Shut up, will you?
- Shut up? Sure.
"Two bank robbers stage daring, daylight holdup."
Hey, how about that, huh?
"Daring... daring."
"Two armed men wearing Halloween masks robbed the North Valley bank early today...
- I gotta look.
...seizing a teller,
Miss Margaret Miller, to shield their getaway."
Wow. Does this turn you on, huh?
Two hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
- Iggy.
- Wow.
Iggy, we don't get 250,000 like the papers say.
We get 160 grand.
A hundred and six...
- Are you tryin' to snow me?
- Get your hands off me, meatball.
Get 'em off.
Don't you do that again.
A hundred and sixty.
How come the papers don't say that?
- Do you believe the papers or me?
- What do I know?
I've been out risking my neck, laying phony leads.
You've been in here, sitting on the glue.
Well, why don't you ask
Miss America there?
She's the money lady.
Hey, it was a quarter million, wasn't it?
Two hundred grand?
One lousy hundred sixty...
[man] Don't do it, Iggy.
What I want to know is, how come it don't bother you, huh?
Two of you wouldn't have cooked this up?
Oh, come on, Iggy.
You're more of a drag than she is.
All right, what are we gonna do about her?
[Man] To tell you the truth, she's been a pretty good girl.
No hysteriaville, no gas.
No struggling.
She's got consideration for other people.
I say we ought to turn her off right now.
Is that another one of your big ideas?
You see this?
Everyone in town is gonna be lookin' at our girl's picture.
They dig her now, all those helpful little citizens.
And that one little old man,
Eyewitness Charlie, with 20l20 vision.
Who always happens to be looking out a window when you're dragging out a body.
- [Iggy] What's the action then?
- We cool it, cool it, all of us.
- Cool it.
- Mother, I'm gonna take this gag off.
You got any ideas about noise?
All right. That's good...
...because I've got sensitive ears, and when someone yells,
I do things.
Things like make me hate myself in the morning.
Now, Mother, here's the picture.
We hole up here a few days.
We're stuck with you.
Now, we don't want you getting sick or scared or finking out.
That's no good.
Not for us. Not for you.
[Stammering] What are you gonna do with me?
Well, first you've got to believe one thing.
One killing, more or less, won't make any difference.
We've got nothin' to lose.
Anybody we knock off from here on in, is just a little more gravy, see?
- I understand.
- That's solid, Moms.
Come on.
Let's make with the cookin'.
Iggy brought groceries. Come on.
We got steaks, we got salmon.
What's it gonna be?
Steak. I'll have mine rare.
Make mine well.
I can't stand the sight of blood.
Some desperate character
I got for a partner, huh?
[Door rattling]
[Meowing]
All right, fleabag, get out of here.
- Let him stay a while, Dan.
- What for?
- I like cats.
- You like cats?
Yeah. I ever tell you about
Acey-Deucy, my old cat?
- No, and you ain't going to.
- As long as he was alive, I was lucky.
- He was a real friend.
- You're breaking my heart.
Come on, I want to talk to you.
Don't stand there flapping your ears.
Make with the cooking.
I like the cat.
Don't forget, I'm watching you.
I don't trust that dame.
I don't trust her.
I don't want you to trust her.
The thing is, she might play along if we con her into thinking we might turn her loose.
- You wouldn't, would you?
- Are you out of your mind?
[Indistinct murmuring]
[Dan] Nah, you're kidding.
[Iggy] What's holding you up?
Move it, will you?
I think my watch stopped.
What do I care?
What's with the watch?
- I wanted to time the steaks.
- That's a clock, ain't it?
Move it, will you?
[Meowing]
What do you think you're doing?
Not that way, Dan, somebody will hear.
[Stammering] He wanted to go out.
I... I didn't make a break.
I... I wouldn't do it. I wouldn't.
Okay.
Okay.
Because I got friends.
Ten little lead-nosed friends in here.
And they all run faster than you do, Moms.
[Stammering] I know.
Now, let's get one thing straight.
Don't touch that door again.
Not that door, or any window in there.
- You got that straight?
- Got it?
- Yes.
- You just used up all your luck, lady.
Now, don't try me again.
How about Thursday night at the drive-in?
- What's playing?
- Night of the Surter.
- What was that we saw tonight?
- Surter Beach Party.
- And the night before last?
- Son of Surt and Sinbad the Surter.
- Double feature.
- Canoe...
Do you ever get a spooky feeling that we keep seeing the same movie over and over?
And all they do is change the titles a little?
Yeah, it's terrific stuff, isn't it?
Couldn't we, just once, see a nice quiet movie, where boy meets girl, they have problems which aren't weird, they fall in love, and live happily ever after?
Why would you want to see unhealthy stuff like that?
Oh, I don't know. Maybe once
I'd like to go to a movie where I don't get seasick.
I'll make you a deal.
You go with me Thursday night, next time I'll take you to one of those happily ever after clambakes. Deal?
- I guess.
- Where's the thing playing?
Oh, who knows? Maybe they don't make movies like that anymore.
Well, sure.
You wanna know why?
Because people don't want to be depressed by all that slop.
Ha! That Henderson boy went right into the house with her.
[Shouting] Right into the house.
She and the Henderson boy, the two of them.
Why shouldn't he go in the house?
He's been hanging around since he was old enough to wave bye-bye.
Nevertheless, they happen to represent two separate and distinct members of the opposite sex.
- Alone, in that house.
- You tell them, kid.
With their parents all over Europe, someone's got to keep an eye on those girls.
Meantime, by authority of the Federal Communications Commission, and the grace of a kindly Providence, which gave me the power of not having to listen to people,
I am now going off the air.
Don't you dare take that thing off!
I haven't finished talking.
Good night, old woman.
I can't hear what you're sayin', but whatever it is,
I disagree with you 100 percent.
[Canoe] You're out of peanut butter.
How come there aren't any olives?
- [Girl] Put them on the shopping list.
- Okay.
- Hi, DC.
- [Meowing]
You know, Patti, sometimes you worry me.
You don't eat enough to keep a bird alive.
Canoe. This is just a wild idea, but has it ever occurred to you there's more to life than surfing and eating?
- Like what?
- Forget it.
I just realized
I was talking to myself.
- Hey, your folks are in Venice.
- I know.
Your father got indigestion from a clam sauce, but feels better now.
Huh.
Bills, bills, bills.
Look at this, nothing but bills.
Surf news should be comin' up about now.
You listen. I'm gonna straighten up and go off to bed.
- Okay.
- Hi, DC.
Watch the crumbs, will you, fellas?
Pass the word. Watch the crumbs.
[TV announcer]
According to authorities, the desperados and their victim may have traveled north in an effort to escape this area.
- Their car was discovered on...
- That's Miss Miller.
...outside of Fresno.
- Who?
Miss Miller, the Christmas Club window at the bank.
- I've known her for years.
- Oh, yeah, so have I.
She goes to our Laundromat.
Kind of creepy, isn't it?
All this happening in your own neighborhood, to people you know.
Want me to stick around until your sister comes home?
- You know, the protecting bit.
- No, thanks.
All right.
[TV] And now, surters, here's the word for tomorrow.
This is your Weather Gremmie with the beach news for the a.m.
Goleta to Zuma, sea conditions light to moderate.
Malibu, moderate in the early morning, with some real heavies expected.
Hey, Pat, surf's up tomorrow at Malibu.
You want to go?
Yeah, sure.
Good night. [kisses]
Good night. [kisses]
That's all for tonight, surters.
The word is "go."
See you at the beach.
Mmm. Come on, here. Come on.
That's a good boy.
Good one.
Wow. 11:15?
Man, I gotta get some sleep.
[Motor rewing loudly]
[Tires screeching]
- I thought we'd almost had it there.
- Sorry, one of Patti's friends.
Oh. [chuckling]
- Is it a date, then?
- Mm-hm.
You won't regret it, I'm sure.
Mother is an extremely fine cook.
- I'm sure she is, Gregory.
- Mother cooks the best duck.
And as for the duck, did I tell you it was a Gadwall?
No, I don't believe you did.
I, uh, stood all day in a duck blind to get it.
In the pouring rain.
I almost got pneumonia.
- Oh, I'm so sorry.
- No. It's all right. It was worth it.
Well worth it.
It's a beautiful creature.
Perfectly beautiful. Superb eating.
Mother... Mother prepares duck in the classic, old-fashioned way.
She hangs it out on the screen porch for 48 hours before cooking.
It makes all the difference in the world.
- All the difference in the world.
- [Girl] I, um...
I'm looking forward to meeting your mother.
I've heard so much about her.
I know you two are gonna be the very best of friends.
And now, uh...
- Good night.
- Good night.
- I'll see you in the morning.
- Mm-hm.
- Same time as usual?
- Hmm.
[Barking]
[Growling]
[Growling]
[Tearing]
- [Barking]
- Quiet, Blitzy.
Good night, my little beauties. [cooing]
[Growling]
[Meowing]
Oh!
[Knocking]
Okay, where's the duck?
- I beg your pardon.
- I want my duck!
Your duck?
If you please.
I'm sorry,
I really don't know...
[growling] Where is that sneaky, miserable guttersnipe?
- He's got my duck.
- What duck?
Don't you dare pretend with me.
- I saw him come in here with it.
- You saw who come in?
Patricia Randall,
I have had all I can take.
That rotten cat of yours, he molests my prize albino fantails, crawls all over my car every time
I wash it with his muddy paws.
He digs up Mother's bulbs.
He's driven my dog to the brink of a nervous breakdown.
You mean DC?
Well, I'm sorry, but actually, he isn't my cat.
He isn't anybody's cat.
What are you talking about?
He lives here, doesn't he?
Of course, but don't you see?
You don't own someone like DC.
He's family.
[Sighing] Oh, but what am I gonna do?
Shoot. I spent all day in a duck blind.
Humph! Pouring rain.
And I get one duck.
One single Gadwall.
And that flea-raddled fiend had to go and steal it.
I know you're upset, but be honest. It was dark, wasn't it?
It could have been that nasty cat from across the street.
The one who does everything that DC gets blamed for.
- [Meowing]
- Now, do you think...
Oh, DC, how could you?
Hold this.
DC, give that to me this instant.
[Meowing]
I want you to know
I'm very, very disappointed in you.
Oh.
Oh, Gregory, I am sorry.
I can't think what could have come over him.
Bad, bad cat. Ah!
"Bad, bad cat"?
You're a menace to the whole neighborhood.
Mark you, if I had my way, the authorities would do away with you.
Now, wait a minute, Gregory.
DC's a cat.
He can't help his instincts.
He's a hunter, just like you are, only he's not stupid enough to sit out in the pouring rain all day.
Well!
Just let me make myself quite clear.
You better keep him locked up at night.
The next time I find him at our place,
I'll give him a pantsful of buckshot.
Nine times, if necessary.
[Meowing]
I know.
I don't care for him much, either.
But he does have a point, don't you think?
Was that Gregory
I heard down there?
- Correct.
- He sounded angry.
Yeah, I believe he was.
- What goes on around here, anyway?
- Nothing, nothing at all.
DC just happened to take a duck off Gregory's back porch.
- "Happened" to take a duck?
- Yes.
Gregory came stamping and banging over here to find it.
Furious. Made a perfect fool of himself.
I don't think he's a stable person.
- There goes my duck dinner.
- Your what?
He invited me to his house for dinner.
His mother was gonna fix the duck.
Fix the...
Ingrid, don't you see?
You're walking into a trap.
For goodness sakes, Gregory drives me to work in the morning.
At night he picks me up and he takes me home.
If he wants to go to all that trouble, the least I can do is be courteous if he asks me to dinner.
How can you be so blind?
It began with the old car pool routine, right?
Why shouldn't it? His law office happens to be next door to where I work.
But the point is, there used to be five people in that car, then Gregory traded in his sedan for a two-seater sports car.
And Mr. Burke,
Miss Patters and Miss Mosely were ruthlessly squeezed out to find other transportation, correct?
- Now, listen...
- Creeping matrimony, that's what it is.
The car pool, the duck dinner, a movie here and there.
Inky, you're taking the gas and you don't even know it.
Thank you, dear,
I'm sure you mean well, but I think I can handle the Gregory situation in my own bumbling way.
I'm sorry, but I suppose at your age, when that important person hasn't come into your life,
- well...
- Well, what?
Well, I suppose a tinge, just the faintest tinge, of desperation, begins to blow your judgment.
Good night.
I can assure you, there is no tinge of desperation in my outlook.
- And my vision is exceptionally clear.
- Good.
Which, I might add, brings us to your friends.
- My friends?
- Yes, dear.
The one we've been tripping over all these years.
Canoe? That's very unfair.
Canoe is... well, he's just defenseless.
He's very sweet and young, and...
...needs help.
- I certainly agree he needs something.
Doesn't he do anything but mope around in shorts
- and eat us out of house and home?
- Just shows how little you know him.
- Canoe has plenty of ambition.
- What?
To be the first 50-year-old surfer at Santa Monica?
If you ask me, he's...
What's the matter?
DC's wearing a wristwatch.
Well, what will that dear, sweet, innocent cat be bringing home next?
The Hope Diamond, I imagine.
- Where do you suppose he got it?
- I don't know.
Probably some child slipped it on, or some teenager put it on for a joke.
Good night. Check with lost and found in the morning.
[Patti] Ingrid?
Look. Someone started to scratch something on the casing.
See? "H-E," and that looks like part of an L.
H-E-L...
I'll bet somebody was trying to write
"help" and they were interrupted.
Somebody's in trouble.
What cooks in that wild little head of yours now?
Somebody's in trouble.
I feel it in my bones.
You bet. Now get out and let me go to sleep. I'm a working girl.
Don't you think we ought to do something?
Good night.
Come on, DC, give.
Someone does need help, don't they?
I know you could find a way to tell me if you really wanted to.
A smart cat like you.
You can be such a rat sometimes.
Don't say anything, just point me towards the coffee.
What's wrong with you?
I didn't close my eyes once last night.
Oh, I've got huge dark circles under my eyes.
- And me so young.
- What's bothering you?
I just couldn't stop thinking about this watch.
Especially that pitiful cry for help on the back.
Oh, you're not going to start that, so help me...
You know, I thought and thought and thought, and I think I finally know the answer.
The watch belongs to her.
- The kidnapped woman?
- Yeah.
Come off it. How far out can you get?
Does it have a name?
- [Honking]
- No, but it's exactly the sort of watch a woman like that would wear:
Feminine, yet... bank tellerish, if you see what I mean.
Patti, you are absolutely impossible.
Have a nice day at the office, Inky.
You've got that terrible butter-won't-melt-in-your-mouth expression.
I know what's going on in your little mind,
- and I forbid it.
- What do you mean?
You're not going to overdramatize this, like you do everything else.
I absolutely forbid you to get the police stirred up with another of your hallucinations about people in trouble.
You're not to go near the police with that watch.
- Certainly.
- Bye.
- [Gregory] Good morning, Ingrid.
- Good morning.
Naturally, I wouldn't go to the police.
This is a job for the FBI.
May I help you?
- Yes, I'd like to see a, uh...
- We call them agents here.
- Yes, I'd like to see an agent.
- May I ask what about?
I have information about one of your crimes.
- Thank you. Would you wait over there?
- Yes.
- These are for you, Mr. Hart.
- Thank you.
- I'm back at 11:00.
- Yes, sir.
- Morning, Hart.
- Good morning, Mr. Kelso.
- Hi, Vicky, anything for me?
- No, sir.
[Kelso] If Mr. Paul calls about the bank records, put him through.
See you around.
- Is he an agent?
- Yes, he is.
- Nice face, hasn't he?
- Why, yes.
[Buzzing]
Yes, Mr. Ellender?
The messenger hasn't arrived yet.
I can put a tracer on it.
We haven't heard from Denver all morning.
I'll connect you with Agent Morrow.
He's got the reports on that case.
[Phone ringing]
[Clearing throat]
Well, we've got 22 Howards in Los Angeles County.
Better start right at the top.
Mr. Kelso, I have something to report on one of your cases.
It's a family cat.
He's called DC.
That means "Darn Cat."
Daddy named him, he called him something worse,
Mother won't let us use that.
Excuse me.
First, what is your name?
Patricia Randall,
808 Pendelton Avenue.
Uh-huh, and what is this information you have, Miss Randall?
It's DC, our cat.
He likes to prowl around at night, as cats do. Nothing wrong with that.
And he likes people, as a general rule, if they're nice and give him food.
He goes back.
I think he has a regular route to pick out food, sort of like a milkman in reverse.
- And this relates to one of our cases?
- Yes. Yes, it does.
Last night
DC was out roaming around, and stole a duck from Mr. Benson down the street.
Ah, Miss, um, Randall...
I'm afraid that that's a police matter.
You see, our jurisdiction is limited to certain fields of investigation.
At the present time, duck stealing is not one of them.
How about bank robbery and kidnapping?
Maybe I'd better hear the rest of your story.
Thank you.
Well, last night DC came home wearing a wristwatch.
- Wearing a wristwatch?
- Yes.
- Instead of his collar.
- Oh.
And I couldn't help thinking what
I would do if I were poor Miss Miller, held prisoner by two hoodlums,
- and a stray cat came wandering in.
- Mm-hm.
Don't you see? I'd try to put something of mine on the cat as a clue.
Like a wristwatch, maybe even try to scratch something on it.
Do you have this wristwatch?
Mr. Kelso, I knew you'd understand.
That's why I selected you personally.
Here.
You see, of course, on the back, where she started to scratch the word "help,"
- and was interrupted.
- Uh-huh.
"H-E..."
And that squiggle could be an "L."
Well, that doesn't quite spell "help," does it?
She was wearing a wristwatch at the time of her abduction.
We have only a superficial description.
- This may or may not be the watch.
- But wouldn't it be enough to start on?
I wonder if you could wait here for just a few moments?
Of course. My entire day is at your disposal.
Thank you, Miss Randall.
- It's a goofy idea.
- That's what I thought too, sir.
- The only thing is, I like it.
- You do, sir?
I don't like this paper chase someone's leading us on.
Those 20-dollar bills from the bank we've been picking up
- at convenient towns up the valley.
- They went in another direction?
Or stayed here in the city.
This watch lead ties in with that.
- How's your workload, Kelso?
- Me, sir?
Uh, well, I'm going over old bank records on Johnny the Cooch.
- We're ready to trip him up.
- The Cooch can wait.
Kidnapping takes priority.
I want you to set up surveillance and tail this cat.
- Tail the cat?
- He may take us to the criminals.
That's all.
Actually, I don't have any experience in tailing cats.
For that matter, who does?
Sorry, sir. You wish me to set up a surveillance on this informant, exactly as if we thought of him as a person?
Unless, of course, it works out better to think of him as a cat.
Sir, I think it's only fair to tell you,
I don't get on well with cats.
There's a kind of an antagonism between us.
- Is that so?
- Yes, and I have a slight allergy.
Allergy? I know the medical records of every man in this office.
Have you been keeping something from me?
It's a very small allergy, sir.
- Hardly worth mentioning.
- Don't.
Stay in touch. I'm available on this case 24 hours a day.
Yes, sir.
Sir, it's just that every time
I'm around c...
C... [loud sneeze]
Gesundheit, and good luck.
Thank you, sir.
[Sneezing]
Yes, a lot of people are gonna be sorry for the things they said about DC.
[Laughing] Wait till they find out he's working with the FBI.
I don't think we should expose your cat's relationship with us at this time.
I'd like to remain as inconspicuous as possible.
You don't want everyone in the neighborhood to know who you are?
Exactly. People tend to become overstimulated when they discover an FBI man in the neighborhood.
It interferes with the quiet, orderly process of investigation.
- Hmm.
- Especially kidnap cases.
See, this places the life of the kidnap victim into additional jeopardy.
We've gotta not generate too much heat?
The kidnappers'll chicken out, kill Miss Miller, dispose of the remains and take off?
Uh, that's one way to put it, yes.
Oh.
You go first.
Remember, everything quiet, calm, inconspicuous.
Quiet, calm, inconspicuous.
[Whistling]
That brazen creature.
Right in broad daylight!
What are you cackling about now?
A strange man just went into the house with Patti.
- So what?
- He was carrying a bag.
Don't get yourself up in a sweat, old woman.
- It's probably the plumber.
- It was not the plumber!
- This man was nicely dressed.
- That's the way plumbers dress now.
The prices they charge these days,
I'm surprised he wasn't wearing a tuxedo.
[Kelso] Do you have any friends?
People who are in and out all the time?
I'm afraid so.
Father always complained we were running a rehabilitation center for punch-drunk juveniles.
Uh-huh. I'd prefer a room on the second floor, actually.
To reduce the chance of somebody coming in and finding me at work.
- This your room?
- Ingrid's. My sister.
- Oh. Would she mind?
- No, not at all.
- She'd be only too happy to help.
- Good.
That's the side door from the kitchen?
Yes, that's the exit DC uses when he goes out for an evening on the town.
Uh-huh. Tonight, we'll set up our communications unit in here.
Whatever you like.
All right. And now, I suppose
I'd better meet the c... c...
- [sneezes]
- Bless you. What did you say?
[Rapid breathing]
I said I...
...suppose I...
...better meet the...
- Oh.
Ah, DC. He's probably goofing around under the bed or something.
That's his favorite spot.
- Ah, your sins have caught up with you.
- [Meowing]
This is your FBI.
Well. [chuckle] This is the...
...informant, as we say down at the office.
Hear that, DC?
You're the informant now.
Nice little kitty cat.
Good, good kitty cat.
- Is he friendly?
- Mm-hm.
He almost got me that time.
He's all right.
Don't make any sudden moves because it tends to set off his reflexes or something.
Uh-huh. Oh, yeah.
Doesn't seem to like me, does he?
I guess that's a bad sign, the kind of people
- that animals don't like?
- It doesn't mean a thing.
DC and Daddy loathe one another, and Daddy's the Lamb of the Year.
Say, I wonder if you would excuse me for just one minute. I think we better get this show on the road.
- What are you going to do?
- I have some work to do with DC before we start our surveillance.
Photos and so on.
- Oh, for the papers, you mean?
- No, for our own people to study.
See, there's finger... pawprints, plaster impressions...
...samples of his fur...
Bless you.
You're catching a terrible cold.
DC, pull yourself together.
You want me to get you something?
No, no. I'm fine. It's just a slight allergy I have around c... c...
- Around, uh...
- Oh.
Wonder if you'd put him on the bed and let me get a picture of him?
- There you go.
- Could you get him to stand up?
- I'll get a full-figure shot.
- Oh, yes.
Uh...
There we go.
Come on, DC, cooperate.
Come on, DC, you're working for the FBI now. There.
There.
Uh, that's not any good.
We can't see him properly.
Wait a minute.
Here's what he likes.
Here.
[Meowing]
Where'd he go?
- Back under the bed.
- [Hissing]
I should've taken the pawprints first.
You're right.
He's not about to come out.
Can't we just get ahold of him there and drag him out?
Sure, if you want to lose a hand.
[Growling]
The Bureau has spent $19,800 of the taxpayers' money training me for emergencies.
They expect something for their cash.
I have no intention of being intimidated by this c... c...
...animal.
- Well, you are a very brave man.
- Thank you.
All right, when I count three, we'll both grab him at the same time.
- But move fast.
- Let's go.
- You ready?
- Let's go. Yeah.
- [Yowling]
- One, two, three.
[Yowling, snarling]
Oh, DC. You're bleeding.
No, it's nothing.
Probably just an artery.
Say, would you get him down for me, please?
You're not going ahead with this?
I'm afraid you underestimate me.
We shall proceed with the pawprinting.
All right.
[Growling]
Come on now, DC, don't be difficult.
- What's that?
- It's ink.
Ink? Can't we do that in the bathroom?
Ingrid will murder me if we get ink on the rug.
Oh, sure. Let's go.
- [Meowing]
- Don't make such a fuss, DC.
You should be ashamed of yourself.
Sorry about the washing.
Girl's bathroom, you know.
- It's okay.
- DC!
- Come on.
- Good old kitty cat.
- Nice, nice kitty cat.
- [Hissing]
[Whispering] Spread this out over there.
Let's see. I guess I'll put the pawprint in the space for the thumb.
Oh, hurry.
I can't hold him any longer.
Oh, all right.
Here we go, now.
Just relax there.
Take it easy, there, now.
It won't hurt a bit.
- [Growling]
- [Knocking]
Oh, Canoe.
- Can I what?
- No, he's a friend of mine.
- I promised to go to the beach.
- That's not so good.
Is he one of the kids that hangs around?
Yes, and he has kitchen privileges, and he's as easy to get rid of...
Try to get rid of him.
It's important.
- What do I say?
- Anything. Just keep him away.
All right.
Hurry back, for the love of heaven.
- [Knocking]
- [Meowing]
Okay, tiger, it's either you or me.
[Growling]
- Patti?
- [Weakly] Yes?
What kind of a get-up is that to go surfing in?
Want the crowd to think you're an eccentric?
Please go on without me.
I don't think I can make it today.
Well, Patti, are you all right?
I've never seen you like this before.
- Can I help?
- It's all right.
I just feel terribly, terribly weak.
[Straining] If you're so weak, how come I can't get through the door?
Please go, Canoe.
I can't bear you to see me looking like this.
- [Loud scream]
- [Meowing]
- What was that?
- [Meowing]
- What was what?
- That bloodcurdling scream.
- [Crashing]
- Canoe, will you please go?
I'm sorry. I didn't realize
I was butting in on a murder.
- Oh, don't be silly.
- [Crashing]
You know how DC hates water.
He's having a bath.
By himself?
All right. If you won't go to the beach,
I'll make myself a sandwich.
Kitchen privileges are temporarily withdrawn.
[Yowling]
He's gone.
Pawprints everywhere!
Yeah, except on the card.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Aha. The best pawprint I ever made.
The first point I wish to make is that time is not on our side.
The word is move, and move swiftly.
We're gonna follow an informant whose information may or may not be reliable.
However, he could lead us to the Miller kidnappers.
Okay, here's the physical.
Name of the informant: DC Randall.
Nationality: Siamese.
Sex: Male.
Eyes: Blue.
Weight: 17 pounds.
- Seventeen pounds?
- Exactly.
Hair, or in this case, fur:
Black streaked with tan and white.
- You did say "fur"?
- Correct.
- You want us to follow a cat?
- That's the assignment.
How do you follow a cat?
They go through fences and culverts.
They climb trees and phone poles.
Wither he goest, you will go.
- You have a question, Graham?
- I've got an old dog who's a lot better at tracking cats than I am.
We don't have time for comments.
I'd like to remind you, a woman's life is involved here.
- Sorry.
- Okay.
Now, tonight you'll take up your initial positions in the area surrounding the Randall house, here.
When the informant leaves, it'll be our job to contain him loosely, within a moving, fluid perimeter.
It's important he doesn't become aware of us as this might alter his regular nocturnal behavior.
Hold it.
Who do you think you're kidding?
- What do you mean?
- You think I don't know
- what's going on upstairs?
- You do?
I didn't come in from Stupidsville on last night's bus.
- You've got a woman in that apartment.
- Hold it. What does that mean?
Don't double-talk me.
I've got ears, haven't I?
Uh, it's Dan's mother.
She come in unexpected, sudden-like.
We didn't know. That's all.
I don't care if it's Pocahontas.
You got three people living there, and that'll cost you another 20 dollars.
- I'll bring it right down.
- Don't bother.
I'll come up and get it.
I like to know my tenants.
- Can't. She's sick.
- What's wrong with her?
- Nothing catching, is it?
- It's her nervous system.
It's all fouled up.
She can't stand visitors.
Iggy.
- We gotta leave, gotta get out of here.
- What for?
The old battle-ax knows we got a dame up here.
She heard her talking.
I told her it was your mother.
Why didn't you tell her it was the TV?
I told you a million times, the TV.
- I gotta talk to you. Private.
- Why private?
- We got no secrets from Moms.
- Come on, will you? Please.
All right, all right.
Go in the kitchen and get a glass of water.
And stand by the sink, where I can see you.
Okay, fill me in.
Well, I found a place.
Where?
I got a big bin I spotted in an alley two blocks away.
Back of a store, where they dump trash.
Not so good. It's too close.
Anyway, I don't like bodies.
They always turn up at the wrong times.
We gotta unload her. The lady downstairs is gonna start nosing around.
[Dan] I say we got it made, just as long as we sit tight.
- [Iggy] I say we make a move.
- [Dan] We sweat it out right here.
Listen, Dan...
...anything else I play it your way, right?
- Just one condition.
- Who says you make conditions?
- Just one.
- Such as?
She goes.
All right. But not until later.
And not in the trash bin.
See if you can't lose the car somewhere, get her out of the city.
[Kelso] You sure your sister won't mind us using her room?
No, not a bit. I told you, she'd be happy to help.
Good.
Spires, this is Control.
Do you read me?
Sweet and clear. You reading me?
Affirmative. Excuse me.
What's your exact position?
In the alley, about 30 feet from the Randall back gate.
You're the only one who can see the informant when he hits the alley.
Let me know which way he turns.
Cahill, what's your field of vision?
West of Whittier, east of the bend in Wetherby Drive.
- Stand by. About three minutes to go.
- You're young to be doing this work.
- I mean, it's terribly responsible.
- I'm really not that...
...not that young.
Kelly, are you settled in?
Affirmative. South side of Maple,
50 feet from the junction with Wetherby.
Got it.
You're very athletic looking.
Do you surf?
Uh, no, not anymore.
My legs always looked ridiculous in those shorts.
Besides, I was scared to death half the time.
I don't believe that.
Look at the brave, wonderful things you FBI people do in your job.
Maybe we could chat some other time, huh?
As you very properly pointed out today, a woman's life may depend on what we do.
I'm sorry.
Do you want me to leave?
Maybe that would be best, yes.
Oh, all right.
I only thought if DC happened to wake up and find a strange man in the bedroom...
I just don't know how he's gonna take it.
Uh, you've got a point there.
- Graham, are you settled in?
- Opposite the west end of the alley.
If the informant goes west, you've got him.
If he goes the other way, stand by.
I'll give you a new position.
- Who's the square red one?
- The informant.
- The informant?
- Yeah.
Oh, DC. Oh.
Say, are you sure he always goes out at 9:00?
Oh, yes.
Unless, of course, it's one of his contrary nights.
[Snoring]
[Chiming]
All agents now stand by.
- For goodness sake, act casual.
- What?
Don't let him suspect anything's going on.
Oh, oh.
Nice kitty cat.
[Kelso] Good old kitty cat.
[Chuckling] You can save the hypocrisy.
- He knows you don't like him.
- Oh.
[Chirping]
You're all tensed up.
He's getting the idea something's wrong.
Can't you act casual?
Well, certainly nice weather we're having, isn't it?
And there's a bit of a wind coming up from the east.
[Whispering] That's terrible.
Can't you do any better?
- Well...
- And be careful what you say.
[Meowing]
He can't understand what I'm saying, can he?
Not everything, of course.
He's just a cat.
But mostly everything.
I told you before, let my stuff alone.
And come on in the house, snoopy.
- I thought he's supposed to go out.
- Shh.
Spires, he's on his way.
I have the informant in sight.
He's turning west on the alley, toward Whittier Drive.
Graham, he's coming your way.
Can you pick him up?
I've got him.
He's in the backyard of the next-to-last house on Maple.
I'm going to investigate.
Spires and Cahill, the informant is moving north.
Stand by for new positions.
He's looking up at the side windows of the house.
- Who lives here?
- The Hendersons.
- They moved in last winter.
- Forget it. He's moving to the street.
Kelly, next-to-last house on Maple, informant coming through.
I make him, Control.
He's on Maple Street, bearing toward the business area.
All right, Kelly, leave the car and follow on foot.
Spires, move to the junction of Whittier and College.
[Agent] The informant is approaching the junction of Whittier and State.
Okay, Graham, move to Seventh and State.
Junction Seventh and State.
The informant has now turned west onto State Street.
Cahill, move to Eighth Street, about a half block south of Main.
The informant is moving down the alley leading from State Street to Main.
The informant is stopped on Main Street in front of a delicatessen.
That's Mr. Bartel's delicatessen.
DC always hangs around there and it drives Mr. Bartel out of his mind.
[Meowing]
Get out of here.
Informant's moving, crossing to the south side of the street.
Stay put for a minute, Kelly.
Graham, move to Seventh and Main.
Cahill, had a visual on the informant yet?
Have him, Control.
He's approaching my position.
Informant passed my position, proceeding toward the middle of the block.
Informant has gone into the side yard of an apartment building.
Stick with him.
- Does DC know anybody on Eighth?
- Who knows?
[Meowing]
He's still in the yard. He's interested in something on the second floor.
[Whistles] Let's start pulling in our perimeter.
Kelly, move down Eighth to the building.
Cahill, stay with the informant.
Graham, cut through the backyards and come behind the apartment.
- DC won't be hurt?
- I have to ask you to be quiet.
Spires, start your car and move towards the location with your lights off.
[Meowing]
Back away from that window.
Why don't you let her stick her head out the window and yell for help, meathead!
What'd I do?
Hold everything.
Informant's on the move again.
He's proceeding north on Eighth Street the way he came in.
Oh, no.
Cahill, stay with the informant.
Others return to positions.
I thought we had something there.
I love DC, but he can drive you up the wall sometimes.
We didn't expect to find what we were after on the first pop.
Good, DC makes a scene all over town.
- He must have dozens of stops.
- Dozens?
- [Cahill] Informant's crossing Main.
- Stay with him.
Maybe I shouldn't have said that, but I don't want to see you tense.
- It can't be good for you.
- Excuse me, but I do not get tense.
We are trying not to be emotional.
Alert, yes. Tense, no.
Oh, I am relieved.
Ingrid, when you come to dinner at the house, would you mind wearing something in yellow?
Gregory, I look yuck in yellow.
Do make an effort, dear.
It's Mother's favorite color.
Control, I'm getting hot.
- The informant is suspicious.
- Try and stay with him to the alley.
- Graham's coming in down there.
- Okay.
[Clanking]
Control, the informant has broken off contact.
I've lost him.
All agents, abandon present positions.
Converge on the alley running from Wetherby to Maple...
- Say!
- Hi.
- Shh!
- What do you mean, "shh"?
- What's going on here?
- Quiet, please.
- Report to me when you reach it.
- How dare you tell me to be quiet?
- What's this man doing here?
- I want you to meet Mr. Kelso, from the Federal Bureau of Investigations.
Please stop chattering, or leave the room.
Listen, mister, where do you get off telling me to leave my room?
I really have to ask you to be quiet, and that goes for...
Hi, there.
Cahill, what happened to you?
- What's going on here?
- Ingrid, be still.
It's a matter of life and death.
I'll explain it to you later.
You'll get Tom Swift and his electric scoreboard out of here,
- or I'll call the police.
- Don't call the police about the FBI.
- They won't come.
- Approach the alley from the east.
- Rendezvous with Cahill.
- I don't know about that.
That makes everything official.
Control, we've reached the rendezvous.
All negative.
[Agent] Okay.
[Screeching]
There he is.
- [Cahill] I've got him.
- Graham, Kelly, stay behind.
Cahill, Spires, circle ahead.
We can't lose him again.
There he goes.
I'm not going to have hysterics.
I am going to ask everyone nicely to please leave my room.
- If you'll come out to the hallway...
- I'm not going in the hall.
- Graham, where are you?
- Not sure. I doubled back so much.
Never mind.
Keep the informant in sight.
Bingo.
There he is, moving along a tree branch toward a light frame house.
[Agent] Control, I see him too.
There's a door on the balcony.
He's trying to work it open.
- There are people in the room.
- How many?
It's hard to tell,
I just see shadows.
They're probably armed.
Wait for Graham and the others.
I'm moving around to the front,
Kelly's behind me.
- They're closing in.
- Closing in what?
Spires and I can go in by the balcony.
There won't be any shooting?
DC's in the middle of everything.
I hope not.
We'll try to surprise them.
Oh, man.
- Front door is unlocked.
- Good, use the stairs.
Cahill, Spires, are you in position?
Ready.
Go on in.
[Screaming]
- What's the idea?
- The cat came in here.
Are you guys out of your mind?
There's no...
[wheezing, sneezing]
What's the matt... Oh!
[Meowing]
Oh, you poor darling.
Frightened to death.
That... [sneezing] cat!
[Honking]
- Oh, good morning, Mr. Benson.
- Good morning, Mrs. MacDougall.
I hope Ingrid is feeling better this morning.
- Better? Is something wrong?
- Well, I figured she was sick.
She had the doctor over last night.
Or leastwise,
I assume he was the doctor.
Who else would be up there, in her room?
Exactly.
Mrs. MacDougall, exactly what time was this?
Look at the old buzzard.
I can imagine what she's telling him.
"Of course it's none of my business, but there were men in Ingrid's room."
You won't tell him they're FBI people?
No one must know.
What am I supposed to say? The Kiwanis
Club is having fall maneuvers here?
You're a love. I know you won't give everything away.
Remember, Miss Miller's life hangs in the balance.
So does my car pool.
My reputation won't be worth a plug nickel unless you get them out.
We've got to think of Miss Miller and cooperate.
Of course, but the FBI has gotten along all these years without using my room as a base of operation.
I want Mr. Whoever-He-ls, and his ham radio or whatever-that-is, out of my room by the time I get home, or I'll become very difficult.
- Is that clear?
- Yes, quite.
- Have a nice day.
- Good morning, Ingrid.
- How do you feel this morning?
- Be careful, Gregory.
Be extremely careful what you say.
I haven't had my coffee, and I'm in no mood for stupid, irresponsible remarks.
Oh.
- [Knocking]
- Come in.
- Kelso.
- Yes, sir.
I was just looking at your report.
It probably sounds peculiar on paper.
If I might amplify...
Only thing missing is Chester Conklin and the Max Sennett Bathing Girls.
That's very good.
- However, we did learn something.
- Oh?
There are too many men on the detail.
The informant, that is, the cat, became suspicious.
I felt that we were crowding him a little too much.
That's about the same conclusion I reached.
- I've assigned the men to other work.
- I won't need them.
As a matter of fact, I'm about to forget this whole cat angle.
You can go back to work on Johnny the Cooch.
As you know, I never wanted to be involved in this cat thing.
However, I would like to try one more time by myself.
How, single-handed and at night, are you gonna follow this animal?
- I'll use a small transmitter.
- A trans...
- You wanna bug the cat?
- That's right.
Okay, one more night.
One. No more.
- Thank you, sir.
- And don't try to be a hero.
- If you turn up anything, bring us in.
- Absolutely, sir.
- I sure appreciate your help.
- It's all right.
Our parents are away, so I can use their room.
Don't worry about your reputation.
When it's over, we can explain
- what the men were doing in your room.
- Thanks.
Then we'll restore your image as a nice, quiet, respectful girl,
- who wouldn't get involved with men.
- Oh, please, dear.
I don't mind being respectable, but I don't want to be a cold potato.
I don't think there's danger of that, do you, Mr. Kelso?
- No, I hardly think so.
- Thanks.
The collar's ready.
- Shall I slip it on the informant?
- Oh, yes, please.
You'd never guess, would you?
That's the bug.
- Bug?
- Microphone.
And look, here's a miniature transmitting set.
Sweet, isn't it?
Wherever DC goes, Mr. Kelso can hear everything around him.
Conversation, music, footsteps, anything.
But suppose DC simply shakes him off his trail?
He did last night, didn't he?
Lmpossible. That's where the direction finder goes to work.
- Hey, be careful with that thing.
- Absolutely.
DC has a built-in beeper in his collar, which sends out signals.
And the signals are picked up on this.
Just by turning it, Mr. Kelso can tell by that needle exactly where DC is.
- Oh, come on, Patti.
- I'll prove it to you.
Look, I'll borrow the spare collar and hide you somewhere in the house,
- and we'll get Mr. Kelso to find you.
- Don't be ridiculous.
I've got things to do, and I'm sure...
Don't you want to see how they spend your tax money?
You don't want him to think you're stuffy.
I couldn't care less whether he thinks I'm stuffy or not.
Go in there, it'll be fun.
Here's the collar.
- Hey, this lock sticks.
- No, it works like a charm.
See?
- Okay, Ingrid's all ready.
- Good.
- Ready for what?
- [Knocking]
Oh, Canoe.
- I promised I'd go to the drive-in.
- It's almost 9:00.
- Can you get rid of him?
- Yes, I'll do the Camille bit again.
- Is he liable to keep hanging around?
- Possible.
- He's sweet, but flypaper.
- Hey, keep your date with him.
Get him out of the neighborhood.
This is my last chance.
I can't risk gumming it up.
I wanted to help.
This will help me.
Now, please...
And, uh, hurry.
- All right.
- [Knocking]
[Grunts]
- I'm ready. Let's go.
- What's your hurry?
- I was gonna make a sandwich.
- Are you out of your mind?
Do you want to miss
Night of the Surter, starring Git Gladsby,
"King of the Roaring Surf"?
- I thought they made you seasick.
- Of course.
Don't they everybody?
Mr. Kelso, if you don't mind...
...let's get going.
- It's not 9:00 yet.
Say that again.
[Lngrid] Let's get going.
Now, wait a minute.
Let's just try and pull ourselves together here a minute.
[Lngrid] Patti, you little wretch.
Let me out of here.
Oh.
Hey.
- [Pounding] Patti! Let me out of here!
- I'll get you out.
- Patti's gone to the movies.
- Gone to the movies!
Something seems to be stuck here.
Well, open it.
There's no air.
- I'm suffocating!
- I'll go get a screwdriver.
[Lngrid] I'm suffocating!
Let me out of here!
I'm sorry, but the cat's going out.
I've got to follow it.
[Lngrid] Don't you dare follow that cat!
Get me out of here.
[Pounding]
There's no air!
I'll be back just as soon as I can.
Probably just an hour or two.
Lie down on the floor.
There's usually more air there.
I'm gonna scream.
Worst thing you can do.
Uses up all the air.
[Screaming]
I distinctly heard a woman scream.
Right, and if you don't keep away from that door, you'll hear another.
Okay, push.
I'd have that latch fixed, especially if you go in there a lot.
Excuse me, I've gotta run.
I just hope I haven't lost the cat.
Go ahead and follow that cat.
When you find him, do me a favor.
The both of you, just please stay there.
[Beeping]
[Loud rewing]
[Moans]
What?
[Barking]
Thank you, sir.
Turn off your lights, please.
Good evening, sir.
Enjoy the show.
Hey! You can't drive in without a car.
Come on.
[Meowing]
Lost something, mister?
Your car, perhaps?
- What's that in your hand?
- It's a litter meter.
Measures litter in public places.
- What business is it of yours?
- Health inspector.
Boy, this place is a mess. Look at that.
Pushes the needle off the scale.
I'll bet you got a lot of mice.
Sir, a mouse is no more permitted here than a man without a car.
Then how do you account for all these cats?
There goes another one.
- Inspector, where's your badge?
- [Honking]
[Canoe] All I can say is, there's something weird going on.
[Patti] What do you mean, "weird"?
Well, like whose car is parked outside your house all the time?
Will you please stop grilling me and watch the screen?
[Patti] Look at that one.
Isn't he something?
That's another thing. How come you're interested in surfing pictures?
I thought they made you seasick.
If you ask me, you're the one who's weird lately.
You always used to be so sweet.
I don't know what's happening.
I'm all churned up inside.
Tell you what.
Why don't you go to the snack stand and get yourself a pizza to settle your stomach.
I don't feel like a pizza.
For Pete's sake, stop grumbling and watch the movie!
Oh, all these surfing pictures look alike.
- DC!
- Hmm?
Oh, DC, what are you doing here?
- You should be out prowling.
- What are you getting hysterical about?
- If he wants to stay, let him stay.
- I will not.
You know what you're supposed to do.
Now get with it.
Make the scene.
Take off.
[Coughing]
Does my smoking bother you?
[Patti] I love the smell of tobacco, it's the fumes from the matches.
- Can't you keep it lit?
- All right, forget it.
I'm sorry. I guess neither of us are in a very good mood tonight.
You can say that again.
Why don't we just settle down and watch this fascinating movie?
[Many cars honking]
It's DC.
What on earth's he doing there?
[Honking continues]
What are you... Don't do that.
You'll disturb him.
- What do you think he's doing?
- I'm sorry.
- You're not gonna upset that cat.
- Get that cat down.
Burton, you stay right here.
Burton, keep your paws off of that cat.
[Honking continues]
Excuse me.
[Crashing]
Well, that was a fun picture.
- Take me home now, Canoe.
- Home?
Haven't you seen enough of this thing?
I thought you liked it.
It isn't halfway through.
Oh, please, Canoe.
You know, sometimes you're not the easiest person to get along with.
[Birds cooing]
That, uh, car's still here, I see.
Don't start that again.
Good night, and thank you for the movie.
- I suppose I'm not coming in, huh?
- Correct, and good night.
I warn you, sometime you're gonna push me too far.
I demand to know what's going on here.
Oh, don't be such a drag.
Go home.
Well, you don't have to go away mad.
[Door slamming]
All right, let's go back to beddy-by.
Who, may I ask, put that table there?
I haven't the faintest idea.
- Which way did he go?
- [Gasping]
Don't answer the door.
Someone's shooting someone outside.
I know it's DC. They've shot him and are bringing back his lifeless body.
- [Screaming]
- DC's all right. They missed him.
- You're lying. He's hurt.
- Hold it down. I gotta call in.
I had a feeling he'd blow this case open.
- The robbers are in this neighborhood?
- I don't want to jump to conclusions, but we stirred up a hornet's nest.
Kelso requesting Control. Emergency.
- [Sneezing]
- [Knocking]
Oh, DC, there you are.
Did they hurt you?
However did you find them?
I was trailing DC through a yard down the street, and he roused up some pigeons, and person unknown ripped off a shotgun blast at us.
- Main Control, go ahead.
- Agent Kelso here, sir.
- I have something worth looking into.
- That wasn't robbers.
That was your nasty Gregory.
Shooting at DC.
- Who's Gregory?
- He lives down the street.
- He keeps pigeons.
- Go ahead, Kelso.
- Oh, boy.
- Kelso!
The situation I was just talking about, it just checked out.
Negative.
[Loud pounding]
Step aside, please.
Where is he?
Where do you think you're going?
To shoot DC?
I didn't shoot your rotten little beast, but I should have.
- Is anything wrong?
- There most certainly is.
You're not going upstairs to murder DC in cold blood.
I am not after your moronic cat.
I'm after the man that was following him.
Yes, a prowler behaving in a very peculiar manner.
- Why don't we all go talk about it?
- Ingrid!
I am going to go through every inch of this house
- and make sure he didn't sneak in here.
- I've got to break communications.
- I hardly think that's necessary.
- Nevertheless,
I am going up.
[Gregory] After all, there's just you two girls here, and I would never forgive myself if I woke up and found one of you had been murdered.
You've got nerve, bursting into my room.
[Gregory] Now, Ingrid,
I want you to believe that my paramount thought is for your safety.
[Patti] We're perfectly safe.
There's no prowler here.
[Gregory] I am not a man for half-measures.
I shall not be content until I have searched every inch of this house.
Gregory Benson, I will not have you tramping around my room this way.
And put down that ridiculous thing before you shoot somebody.
Let me assure you, I am familiar with the handling of this firearm.
[Lngrid] I'm warning you, if you don't get out this instant, this very instant...
[Gregory] I have no intention of leaving...
[meowing]
Excuse me. The wiring seems okay, Miss Randall.
- Wiring?
- Yes, but don't hesitate to call.
- No, thank you.
- Just a minute. Now you just wait!
I hope you don't think I am goof enough to believe that ridiculous story about you being in that closet to fix that wiring.
- If I may...
- Because...
...if you think I think that, you have another think coming.
Miss Randall, I'm afraid we'll have to take him into our confidence.
You will take me into nothing.
- I want nothing to do with you.
- I'm certain when you hear...
I have borne witness to all the circumstances I care for one evening.
How come he knows your name?
Is he one of the men
Mrs. MacDougall was talking about?
I couldn't say.
Who do you think he is?
I shudder to think.
I really do.
I can say, it does open up a fascinating area for conjecture.
Oh, don't be such a complete floop, Gregory.
This is all perfectly easy to explain.
Don't say another word, or I'll slap your face.
- We're explaining nothing to him.
- Well.
I hope you realize that Mother is going to take this all very badly.
- Doesn't she usually?
- Ingrid.
There's no reason for you to cast a slur upon my mother.
At least she, after all, is an innocent party.
Yeah. Good night.
Oh, and just one more thing.
I suggest you find yourself another car pool.
Well, goodbye, Gregory.
Oh, Inky, I'm sorry.
It was all my fault.
It's all for the best, I suppose.
Um, well, goodbye and thanks very much for your cooperation.
- Goodbye?
- I've been assigned to a new lead.
I've got orders to wrap up the operation here.
Why?
Well, my boss thinks we're not getting anywhere with our cat surveillance.
I haven't come up with a shred of evidence to connect the cat with the criminals.
But what about Miss Miller's watch?
The office just completed their report on all the jewelers and watch repair people in this area.
Nothing turned up to indicate it belonged to Miller.
But it does.
You know it does.
I don't know. It's a theory and without evidence, we can't waste time.
Oh, I think that's horrible.
What about Miss Miller? Hmm?
You're gonna abandon her to the mercy of those criminals?
That's enough. Patti tends to overdramatize things.
What's worse, she has this diabolical knack of getting everybody involved.
No, it was a good idea, in a way.
We had to be sure.
So long, Patti.
Goodbye.
Oh, I'm sorry.
- Excuse me.
- Sorry. Goodbye, now.
I don't know what you must think of me.
Every time we met, I lost my temper.
That's all right.
We meet all kinds.
That wasn't what I meant to say.
- I, um...
- It's okay.
- So long, now.
- Bye.
That fellow has a most attractive way of putting his foot in his mouth.
- What'd you say his name was?
- Zeke Kelso.
Hmm. Well, no matter.
Let's go to bed.
Tomorrow, if you don't mind, let's get the house back to normal.
Whatever you say.
More evidence.
That's what they want, is it?
Hey! Get out of it.
- No! No, no, no, no!
- Why?
I wouldn't hear of it, absolutely not.
And besides, it's none of my business.
- That's all.
- Of course it's your business.
That's ridiculous.
We can and we must save Miss Miller.
- No, I'm no hero.
- Oh.
Look at me.
Do I look like Elliot Ness?
- No.
- That's the thing. I'm not a hero.
I wanna tell you, not only will I not get mixed up in this thing,
I'm extremely disinterested in the whole thing.
Don't get excited.
Just do me a favor. Leave...
Please leave me alone.
- I'm very busy.
- Just listen to me for a moment.
I know you very well, and I know you're a sweet man, and you would never forgive yourself if something terrible happened, and it could.
I can just see the headlines.
"Mr. Hofstedder.
He Could Have Saved Her."
Would it say that?
Of course, it would.
Wait a minute, don't get excited.
You don't have to do a thing, just back me up if I get in trouble.
- Who are you calling?
- It's all right, just the FBI.
Oh, the FB... The FBI?
Well, sir, I just hated to give up on this cat angle.
Zeke, you know as well as I do, we haven't an iota of evidence
- to connect Miller with that watch.
- [Buzzing]
- Yes?
- Emergency call for Agent Kelso.
Put it through.
Agent Kelso speaking.
[With accent]
This is Daphne Hofstedder speaking of Hofstedder's Jewelry Store,
1833 West Mapleton Avenue.
Yes, may I help you?
I heard you were looking for information concerning a certain watch.
- Yes, we are.
- Well, a couple of weeks ago, a woman came into the shop to buy a band for her watch.
Uh, what was the name? Oh.
- A Miss Margaret Miller.
- Margaret Miller?
Would you describe this band that you sold to Miss Miller?
Uh... expandable.
Uh... it was gold-plated.
Rather inferior, not expensive.
- And the watch?
- Seventeen jewels, rather rectangular-shaped, with raised filigree... things on the face.
Rectangular with raised filigree.
May I ask why you haven't come forward earlier with this?
Well, I was away... on my holiday...
...to Mexico, on a bus.
Will you be in town?
Yes, I will be here anytime you want to talk to me... on the phone.
Thank you very much for your cooperation.
Goodbye.
That's it, the tie-up.
- Can I move?
- Just a moment.
- Miss Hargrave?
- Yes, sir?
Would you get me Mr. Hofstedder at 1833 West Mapleton, please?
- He's a jeweler.
- Yes, sir.
- I don't buy that just yet.
- Yes, sir.
I want to cross-check.
Let me see that watch again.
[Buzzing]
- Yes?
- Mr. Hofstedder on the line, sir.
Thank you.
How do you do?
I'm speaking for Mr. Kelso at 626-0025.
Did you place a call to this number moments ago?
[Whispering] It's the FBI.
Mr. Hofstedder?
Yes?
Yes. That was us.
My niece, from Mexico, you know.
Oh, the wristband. She...
She sold it.
She's from Mexico.
No, I'm Mr. Hofstedder.
My niece sold it.
Thank you very much.
I appreciate the cooperation.
We won't forget you. Goodbye.
Okay, that's it. Let's go.
Oh, thank you, thank you.
You are a darling. Thank you.
I wonder what they meant when they said they wouldn't forget me.
- [Knocking]
- It's me, Iggy.
- Found a spot. Found a spot.
- Cool it.
Go into the kitchen.
We got business.
Don't kill me.
I won't give you away.
Now, take it easy.
This has nothin' to do with you.
Now, into the kitchen, okay?
Don't let him do it, Dan.
You're not a murderer.
You're not like he is.
Hey, wow.
Listen to the con woman.
I... I don't want to die.
Who said anything about killing?
Come on, into the kitchen.
Come on.
[Iggy and Dan talking]
How do I know you won't botch it?
This ain't amateur night.
You happen to be talking to a pro.
Nice try. Another minute, you'd have had the fire department.
What did I tell you?
You can't trust anybody.
Sorry, Moms, you can see how it is.
We can't afford to have you around no longer.
Come on.
[Coughing] Wait.
What goes on in that pea brain of yours?
I forgot about the loot. Forgot, forgot.
[Knocking]
- Who is it?
- It's the landlady, Mrs. Tabin.
Go away, we're busy.
[Sniffing]
Is that smoke smell coming out of there?
No, it ain't, now beat it.
[Tabin] You open that door!
I've got my pass key.
I'm coming in.
What's the idea?
You can't keep me out of here.
City ordinance four, section 16.
We weren't trying to keep you out, just straightening up a bit.
- Don't like you to see it crumbed up.
- That smoke smell is coming from here.
Those rotten cigars Iggy smokes.
Kinda turn your stomach, don't they?
- Okay, where's the woman?
- Who?
Your old lady. She's sick, ain't she?
I brought her soup.
Now, that's very kind of you.
- Mmm. Smells good.
- Vegetable.
She's in the bedroom.
Too sick to see anyone.
- She's in rough shape, really bad.
- [Under breath] Shut up.
I can't tell you how much we appreciate you coming.
Never mind the snow job. There are three people living in this apartment, and that'll cost you...
Twenty bucks!
That makes us even.
Goodbye, and don't worry about Mother.
She ain't gonna be with us long.
- You can say that again.
- That don't mean you get the 20 back.
Of course not, Mrs. Tabin.
Good night and sleep well.
You're going to bed as usual right after the news?
Just hold the noise down up here.
My sister come for a visit and she don't sleep good.
- Your sister is staying here?
- Right, from Corona.
She's the prison matron out there.
Lucky I got that 20 back, right?
What if that hot serial number turned up in a drug or grocery store?
Forty thousand pads in this city.
And you gotta pick one on top of a human radar station!
She's got a sister that can't sleep nights, because she's a head roach at the state birdhouse. Nice?
Now we got two of them flapping their ears, waiting for us to do something stupid.
Control, Agent Graham in.
Our unit in position.
Graham, you will monitor
Agent Kelso's movements.
But initiate no action until you get the word from me. Clear?
[Graham] Affirmative.
Be prepared for the possibility of strong armed resistance.
All units, now stand by.
I've got a funny feeling about DC going out tonight.
Poor thing. Alone and helpless in the middle of all this.
Pull yourself together. That cat's as helpless as the U.S. Marine Corps.
[Phone ringing]
- Hello?
- Hi, Patti.
- Hi, Canoe.
- You feel all right?
- Fine.
- Whatcha been doing today?
Oh, uh, nothing much.
Funny thing, I happened to be driving by the house a little while ago, and you know, that same blue car is still parked out in front.
Really?
Well, um, [clears throat] is it all right if I come over for a while?
No, not tonight. I, uh...
Oh, I've got this ghastly headache.
You just said you felt fine a minute ago.
- Well, I meant fine,
- [chiming]
Considering the condition I'm in.
Can't you ever understand?
Would you mind cutting that short?
Who was...
Who was that talking?
Ingrid. Yes, it was Ingrid.
She always has this real deep voice when she first comes out of the shower.
Thanks a lot, dear.
Okay. You just get yourself a good night's sleep, and I'll see you tomorrow.
Good night, Canoe.
Okay, dream girl, if that's the way you want to play it.
[Whispering] How about a push to get him started?
I'm afraid not, Mr. Newton.
See, that's the trouble.
None of you really understand cats.
Now, if someone was to go along tonight, someone whom he trusts...
No, Miss Randall.
But supposing DC loses you again?
He's really diabolically clever.
[Kelso] Look.
- Don't you think I...
- [lngrid] No!
[Bird tweeting]
He's on the back porch listening to a bird.
[Tweeting]
How I let myself be talked into this...
I thought Mr. Kelso said you were going to give up the cat theory.
We were, but a new lead came up today to support it.
Mr. Hofstedder rang Mr. Kelso about the watch, or rather, his niece did. She...
How did you know about Hofstedder?
Well, um, his store is only a few blocks away from here, and we're very good friends.
I mean, his niece and I are good friends.
Did Agent Kelso mention it to you?
- [Kelso] He's starting to move.
- Easy, Zeke. Easy does it.
Well, as long as you won't be needing me...
- Where are you going?
- None of your business.
I'm happy to get you out of the house,
- but what do you think you're doing?
- There's something fishy next door, and I won't close my eyes to it like you do.
I won't be an ostrich and bury my head in the sand.
Why don't you try it?
It might improve your appearance.
I know my duty.
Good luck, old woman.
I always say, if you got a duty, you ought to do it.
Get me the police.
Police?
I want to report a prowler.
Yeah, he's dressed like an old woman.
Running around looking in windows.
No telling what he's up to.
Yeah, and tell your men to be careful.
He's dangerous.
That's the 402, all right.
- [Screams]
- All right, relax, buddy.
- Just take it nice and easy.
- [Screaming]
Never mind the hokey scream.
We know who you are.
- Careful, this guy might be dangerous.
- Guy?
I don't know what you're talking about.
[Laughing]
I don't want to tell you how to run your business, but if I was on a job,
I wouldn't wear women's clothes.
You don't have the face for it.
Now, come on.
[Screaming]
[Squelching]
[Squelching]
[Motor rewing]
Control, I've lost visual contact with the informant.
- You make him on the scope?
- I have a faint signal.
He's headed towards the pike.
[Kelso] On a line 100 feet north of this position.
Okay. Report as soon as you pick up your visual.
Yes, sir.
Oh, it's unloading time
It's unloading time
It's unloading time
Oh, it's unloading time
Unloading time
Unloading time
- [knocking]
- Iggy.
Hey. Know what I got?
You ready for this?
I got a laundry truck, filled with old bags of laundry.
- She's in the bedroom. Make it quick.
- Will I. Will I!
- [Meowing]
- What'd you bring that thing in for?
Hey, fella, where did you come from, huh?
You just wait here one minute.
I got a little business to do, then I'll give you milk.
- [Meowing on radio]
- [Dan] Get rid of that cat, and go in and finish her off.
[Iggy] Think it's best to do the job here or in the truck?
[Dan] Here, we don't have to fight her down the stairs.
This is it, Control.
132 Eighth Street.
Okay, we got it.
All units, move in.
Kelso, hold off till we get there.
- [Meowing over radio]
- I can't wait, sir.
I've got a situation here that's breaking wide open.
Iggy, get this thing off of me, will you?
- Get it off!
- It's just my old buddy.
Your old buddy.
Get him out of here.
What's the matter?
- Hey, look.
- Shh.
- You stupe, the cat's bugged.
- [Knocking]
Hello, there. I thought you could help.
I seem to have lost a cat.
Oh, yes, I was wondering who that cat belonged to.
- Come right in.
- Thank you.
You know, till you have a pet of your own, you really...
- Ah, there it is.
- [Meowing]
- I hope he hasn't bothered you.
- No, not at all.
I guess you've been missing your old daddy, hmm?
- He likes to play games.
- Doesn't seem to like you very much.
Actually, it's my wife's cat.
Yes, to be very honest with you, we barely tolerate each other.
- [Dan] You live in this building?
- [Kelso] Near the front.
- Funny, I haven't seen you.
- Funny.
I work nights.
Engineer at the aircraft plant.
Interesting thing about that cat, had a thing on its collar.
I could be wrong, but it looked like a miniature radio transmitter.
I tell you, he is a character.
Always saying to my wife,
"What's he gonna drag home next?"
[Dan] You know something, mister?
I don't think that's your cat.
And I don't think you're an engineer at the aircraft plant.
And I don't think you have a little wife who lives upstairs near the front.
[Knocking]
- Iggy.
- [Meowing]
Oh, there you are, lambie pie.
And you found him!
Oh, my sweet darling.
We've been so worried about you, haven't we, dearest?
Yes, we certainly have.
I'd rather handle it now, dear.
You run back upstairs.
- Not at all. I want to help.
- Aren't you young to be married?
Why not? We were in love.
L'amour toujours, you understand.
Too bad lambie pie didn't buy you a wedding ring.
She's always losing things.
- I found your cat. You run along.
- Why don't we all go?
No need to impose on these nice gentlemen anymore.
- Come on.
- [Dan] One minute.
Now who's kidding who, huh?
Dear, would you let go of my arm, please?
Iggy, get the money together.
We're cutting out.
- What about the old broad?
- Change of plans. Forget her.
We'll take Miss Nosy here instead.
- And I'll take care of you, copper.
- You'd be advised to leave her out.
- You're telling me what to do?
- That's right.
- Please be careful.
- Now, sweetness, I wouldn't hurt you.
I don't care about you, but DC's getting frightened, and he always behaves so badly when... Get him, DC!
Hold it.
Hey!
What are you doing?
No, no, that's my money.
Go away.
Let me go. Ow!
My money, my money.
- Oh, no.
- [Meowing]
[Iggy] That darn cat.
[Patti] Is that too much?
If DC wasn't bad enough before, there'll be no living with him now.
Look at this one.
He's not a bit afraid.
He has a nice jawline, and this picture makes it look as though
- he had a double chin.
- Who?
Zeke. Can you imagine the girl that marries him?
Mrs. Zeke Kelso.
It sounds like something that got caught in a clothes dryer.
Wow. Would you like to see how your gentleman friend spends his nights?
Canoe! [laughing]
The poor darling.
How do you suppose he did that?
- I don't know. I'll get it.
- [Honking]
What in the world was he doing caught in a garage door?
I haven't the faintest idea.
- Good morning.
- Gregory, I'm surprised to see you.
Good morning, Patricia.
Ah, how is our little celebrity this morning?
Ow!
- Bad cat.
- Quick little rascal, isn't he?
I may not be home for dinner.
I'll phone you later.
- Fine, have a nice time.
- I knew all the time, of course, that nothing was wrong. I felt happy to see in the morning papers that my faith in you was justified.
Mother said I should hurry over here as though nothing had happened.
She forgives you for all the anxiety you've caused her.
Thank you, Gregory.
- Thanks, old man.
- I believe you two have met.
Mr. Kelso, Mr. Benson.
Mr. Kelso is in law enforcement.
- Mr. Benson is a duck hunter.
- Really?
I hope you have a license for it.
So long, now.
Goodbye, Gregory.
Regards to your mother.
Well!
[Crashing]
- Sorry, Mr. Benson.
- Hi, Canoe.
I, uh, wondered who that car belonged to.
Mm-hm.
Ingrid's new car pool.
- Great, isn't he?
- Yeah.
Uh, Patti, I don't know how to say this.
- I'm kind of ashamed.
- Canoe.
Whatever happens, you must never be afraid to look me in the eye.
Oh, that's not it.
I got a stiff neck last night.
How did you get stuck in that door?
Well, that's just it.
It happened when...
Well, that guy there...
- Well, I was following you.
- Following me?
- Why?
- Well...
...you and that guy, and you wouldn't let me in the house.
Well, what was I supposed to think?
Canoe, don't tell me you were jealous.
And you didn't think of your stomach, not once?
- How do you feel now?
- Like, miserable.
You do?
Why, that's marvelous.
You're really beginning to mature.
Tell you what, let's go into the kitchen, and you can make a big weird sandwich, and you can tell me all about it.
- Okay.
- Okay.
You might as well wait for me.
It'll save time.
I'm going into the house to murder someone.
Oh, Wilmer, don't try to hide.
Come out and take your medicine like a man.
Wilmer!
Now, our cat's been paid every accolade
And he's earned all his acclaim
In a blaze of glory
He ends our story
In the feline Hall of Fame
But the way life goes
In a year, who knows
From the family he begat
You may wind up with one of
May be the son of
That darn cat
"Is it worth the waiting for if we live till 84?
"All we ever get is gruel
"Every day we say our prayer
Will they change the bill of fare?
"Still we get the same old gruel!
"There’s not a crust, not a crumb can we find
"Can we beg, can we borrow or cadge?
"But there’s nothing to stop us from getting a thrill
"When we all close our eyes and imagine

What?
Please, sir...
...I want some more.
More?
- "Catch him!
- "Snatch him!
- "Hold him!
- "Scold him!
- "Pounce him! Trounce him!
- "Pick him up and bounce him!"
"Wait!
"Before we take the lad to task
"May I be so curious as to ask
His name?
"Oliver"
Oliver Twist, Mr. Bumble.
- You named him so yourself.
- So that’s who he is!
"Oliver! Oliver!
Never before has a boy wanted more!
"Oliver! Oliver!
"Won’t ask for more when he knows what’s in store
"There’s a dark, thin, winding
Stairway without any banister
"Which we'll throw him down, and
"Feed him on cockroaches
Served in a canister
"Oliver! Oliver!
What will he do when he’s black and blue?
"He will rue the day
Somebody named him Oliver!
"Oliver, Oliver
Never before has a boy wanted more!
"Oliver! Oliver!
"Won’t ask for more when he knows what’s in store
"There’s a long, thin, winding
Stairway without any banister
"Which we’ll throw him down, and
"Feed him on cockroaches
Served in a canister
"Oliver! Oliver!
"What, heavens pray, will the governors say?
"They will lay the blame
On the one who named him
"Oliver!"
Out!
"One boy
"Boy for sale
"He’s going cheap
"How much, then?
- "Only seven guineas
- "How much?
"That or thereabouts
"Fine boy
"Boy for sale
"He’s yours to keep
"For 1,000 pennies
"You can work it out
"That’s slightly under four guineas
Knocked down from seven guineas
- "Three pounds, ten shillings
- "Three pounds what, sir?
"Certainly not, sir
"Any advance on three pounds ten, then?
"Going, going
"Gone
"I could not say
He isn’t very greedy"
"I dare not
"I'd be telling you a tale
"One boy
"Boy for sale
"Come take a peek
"Have you ever seen
As nice a boy for sale?"
- How much did you say?
- Only three guineas, Mr. Sowerberry.
- A bargain, if ever there was one.
- I was looking for a boy.
All right, bring him in, Mr. Bumble.
My love, I said we might consider taking this boy...
...to help in the shop.
Dear me. He’s very small.
He is rather small, there’s no denying, but he'll grow, Mrs. Sowerberry.
I dare say he will.
On our bittles and our drink!
These workhouse boys always cost more than they’re worth.
- Where did he come from?
- Mother came to us destitute.
She gave birth to him and promptly died, leaving no forwarding name or address.
Here he is, yours for three guineas.
Cash on delivery.
No, cash upon liking. A week on approval.
If he works hard on a little food, then we’ll keep him.
He can help put the shutters up.
Do you hear, now?
- Then he can clean around the house.
- I'll look after him, missus.
My dear, it occurred to me, he’ll make a delightful coffin-follower.
That expression of melancholy.
Interesting, don’t you think so, my love?
I don’t mean a regular coffin-follower to attend grown-up people, no...
...just at children’s funerals.
A mute in proportion, so to speak?
Precisely. A superb effect, don’t you think?
Do you think you could look like that gentlemen up there?
Perhaps, if I had a tall hat.
Look, it’s Oliver!
- Noah, come on.
- No.
How’s your mother, workhouse?
You leave my mother out of it. She’s dead.
What did she die of? Shortage of breath?
You’d better not say anything about her to me.
Don’t be cheeky, workhouse.
Your mother, she was a nice one, a regular right-down bad one.
What did you say?
It’s a good thing she died when she did
"cause she’d be in prison doing hard labour.
Help!
Get away! Get away from him!
What’s going on down here?
What are you trying to do, wake the dead?
It’s you! Get out of here!
He started it!
Come here, you!
- Quick!
- Hurry up.
Oh, dear!
I'm going off. Water!
Noah, run over to the workhouse.
Get Mr. Bumble. Tell him to come quick.
Where is he? Where is the young rascal?
- Oliver?
- Yes, I'm here.
- Do you know this voice?
- Yes, I do.
Ain't you afraid of it?
Ain’t you trembling when I speak?
No, l’m not!
- He’s gone mad to speak to you like that.
- It’s not madness, it’s meat.
- Meat?
- Meat, ma'am! You overfed the boy.
You raised an artificial spirit in the lad unbecoming to his station in life.
This wouldn’t have happened if you’d fed him gruel. l’d be glad to give you the recipe.
- Having a rest, Mr. Bumble?
- He’s sitting on Oliver.
- Quite right. We must all sit on Oliver.
- You’ve been drinking again?
- I met a friend in the cemetery.
- Help!
Who’s in there?
That coffin should not have been occupied until tomorrow.
It’s reserved for a very important client.
Stand back!
- What’s your explanation, you scallywag?
- He called my mom a name.
And what if he did, you ungrateful wretch?
She deserved what he said and worse.
- She didn’t!
- She did!
It’s a lie.
- Hold your tongue, boy.
- Put him down in the cellar.
It’s really quite comfortable.
Stay there till we decide what to do with you.
Here’s your baggage, workhouse.
Three pounds, indeed!
You can take him back.
"Where is love?
"Does it fall from skies above?
"Is it underneath the willow tree
"That I've been dreaming of?
"Where is she

What you staring at?
Haven’t you never seen a toff?
No, never. I’m sorry. I didn’t...
That’s all right.
- Hungry?
- Yes, I am. I’ve come a long way. l’ve been walking for seven days.
- Been running away from the beak?
- The what?
Don’t say you don’t know what a "beak" is?
It’s a bird’s mouth, isn’t it?
My eyes, how green can you get!
For your information, a beak is a magistrate.
- Who you running from, your old man?
- No, l’m an orphan. l’ve come to London to make my fortune.
You have, have you?
Got any lodgings?
- Money?
- Not a farthing.
Do you live in London?
What the...
I suppose you want someplace to sleep tonight.
Do you know of anywhere?
I know a respectable old gentleman who'll give you lodgings for nothing.
And never ask for the change, if a gentleman he knows introduces you.
Don’t you know me?
He must be a very kind old gentlemen.
Yes, he’s very kind.
And l’m a particular favourite of his.
Now, if you’re coming along, l’d better know who you are.
My name’s Oliver Twist.
And mine’s Jack Dawkins.
Better known as the Artful Dodger.
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Dodger.
Sure the old gentleman won’t mind?
Mind?

Up you go.
- Not again.
- Get out.
Fagin, I brought my new friend to see you.
Oliver Twist.
Sir.
I hope I shall have the honour of your intimate acquaintance.
We’re glad to see you, Oliver.
Aren’t we, my dears?
Yes, Fagin!
Give me back my things. Leave it!
Leave him alone!
Take off the sausages.
Lay a place at the table for Mr. Twist.
Dodger tells me you’ve come to London to seek your fortune.
Yes, sir.
We must see what we can do to help you, mustn’t we?
- Thank you.
- These sausages are mouldy!
Shut up and drink your gin!
You’re staring at the pocket handkerchiefs, my dear?
We just hung them up ready for the wash, that’s all.
- Is this a laundry then, sir?
- Yeah, a laundry!
Not exactly. A laundry would be a very nice thing indeed.
But our line of business pays a little better.
Don’t it, boys?
You see, Oliver...

In the bank, large amounts!

"You’ve got to pick a pocket or two, boys
"You’ve got to pick a pocket or two
"Large amounts don’t grow on trees

Let’s show Oliver how to do it, my dears.
Just a game, Oliver, just a game.
"Why should we break our backs
Stupidly paying tax?
"Better get some untaxed income:
Better pick a pocket or two
"You’ve got to pick a pocket or two, boys

Get out and pick a pocket or two
"You’ve got to pick a pocket or two, boys
"Robin Hood was far too good

"Take a tip from Bill Sikes:
He can whip what he likes
"I recall, he started small
He had to pick a pocket or two
"You’ve got to pick a pocket or two, boys
"You’ve got to pick a pocket or two
"We could be like old Bill Sikes

"We have to pick a pocket or two!"
Put them all back in the box.
All of them.
Come here!
Good boy. What a crook!
We’ve all been hard at work today, haven’t we, my dears?
What have you got, Dodger?
- A couple wallets.
- Lined?
Only the best.
Not as heavy as they might be.
But, very nicely made.
- Ingenious workman, ain't he?
- Does he make these himself?
- With his own lily-white hands.
- What have you got, Charlie?
- A couple of wipes.
- Very good ones.
But you haven’t embroidered them too well though, Charlie.
We’ll have to pick the initials out with a needle.
- You'll need to learn how to do this, too.
- Yeah, the trademark.
In the meantime, you must learn how to make wallets.
- Like the Dodger. Would you like that?
- Yes, if you'll teach me.
Certainly, my boy, no fee.
Just do as Dodger and the others do.
Make them your models, especially Dodger.
He’s going to be a right little Bill Sikes.
Who’s Bill Sikes, Mr. Fagin?
He’s a very clever gentleman.
You’ll meet him tomorrow.
Maybe now. Is it possible, by chance...
...that my kerchief is protruding from my pocket?
- Yes. I can just see the edge.
- Can you?
See if you can take it out without my feeling it...
...like you saw the others do.
"You’ve got to pick a pocket or two, boys
"You’ve got to pick a pocket or two"
Is it gone?
Yes, Mr. Fagin. Look!
Well, that’s a surprise, I must say.
You’re a clever boy, Oliver.
I never saw a sharper lad.
Here’s a shilling for you.
I have to go to the bank.
Bedtime, all of you!
There’s a hard day’s work ahead!
Put up the shutters.
Where do I sleep, sir?
Over here, my dear.
Settle down!
Dodger, take your legs off his bed.
Where’s your manners?
Here, my dear, have a good sleep.
If you go on...
...the way you’ve started...
...you will be the greatest man of all time.
Sweet dreams, Oliver.
Sweet dreams.
Goodnight, sir.
"You’ve got to pick a pocket or two, boys
"You’ve got to pick a pocket or two"
Is he here?
Mr. Sikes. Has he come yet?
Nancy’s inside waiting for him.
- How’s business? Nice and brisk?
- Don’t burn your fingers, will you?
I never do, my dear. Not if I can help it.
Nancy! He’s back! He’s here!
Beautiful.
You’ve done well, Bill.
All one job?
Such a professional.
Now, Bill...
Carry cash? At this time of night?
All those thieves and robbers lurking in dark alleys?
I wouldn’t dare.
Besides, l’ve got to price it first.
Nancy’s waiting. Give you a good supper.
Tomorrow, Bill.
My word on it.

Can I help it? This is my private treasure.
My little pleasure. A cup of coffee...
...and a quick count-up.
I mean, who’s gonna look after me in my old age?
Would you, birdie?
Will you?
Why are you watching me?
Quick! Speak out!
I want to know every detail you saw! l’m sorry.
- Did you see where the box was?
- I don’t think so, sir.
- Be sure!
- Quite sure!
If you’re sure, then l’m sure.
Of course, I knew all along.
I didn’t mean to frighten you.
Brave boy, Oliver.
Did you see any of those pretty things, my dear?
Yes, sir.
They’re mine, Oliver.
My little treasure.
All I got to live on in my old age.
A terrible thing...
...old age.
Yes, sir. I’m sorry.
Can I go back to sleep now, sir?
Certainly, my boy, go to sleep.
Pleasant dreams.
Same to you, sir.
Sauce boat, George IIl, scroll handle, £5.
Tiara, George Il, rose-cut diamond paste, half a crown. l’m coming.
Bill, your breakfast is ready.
For God’s sake.
I'll warm it up for your supper.
Go down to Fagin’s and get the cash, will you?
All right.
I am trying to sleep.
You do love me, don’t you?
Of course I do! I live with you, don’t I?
That bit’s for me, Emmett Fagin.
Eat, eat, eat. Appetite.
Come on, finish your breakfast, it’s time for work.
Hurry up, you’ll miss the morning trade.
- Ain’t there no more sausages?
- You want supper tonight?
Who wants some bull’s-eyes?
Wait a minute! One at a time!
Go on and share them.
Miladies, they must meet our new boy.
What have we got here?
Ladies, I forgot that you must meet our new lodger...
...Mr. Oliver Twist, Esquire.
Nancy and Bet.
Charmed.
We’re all ladies and gentlemen around here. We’re all quality.
Don’t you take no notice of him. Just
"cause you got manners and they ain’t.
Whatcha mean I ain’t got no manners? l’m a regular gent, I am.
Permit me to assist you across the road?
I was going to the palace.
Doorman, a cab, if you please.
Allow me the privilege to escort you in my own carriage.
After you, Your Grace.
Sir Arthur, you are too kind.

Get to work, then. No argument.
There’s fine pickings in the street.
- Go and earn your keep.
- You said we could see the hanging!
Be sure it ain’t your own.
Fagin, l’m waiting.
Waiting, my dear? What for?
Bill will give you what for, if you don’t fork out. Hand over, start counting.
- Rush.
- What do you think we are?
- You and Bill, you’ll be the ruin of me!
- That’s right.
If it’s all the same to you.
- What was that for?
- For getting caught.
I was only practising.
I'll die a pauper yet. Here, take it.
I'll starve. You’ll find me in the gutter with me feet in the air.
Bill might think the count is a bit short, wouldn’t you say?
I only wish you had to get rid of the stuff, that’s all I wish.
He still might, come on.
So me and the boys we’ll live on air till I find a customer?
Heartless, that’s what I am.
Come on, Bet. Ta-ta, kids.
Young Oliver wants to come on the game with Charlie and me.
What’s that? On the job, you mean?
Can I? Please? I’d like to.
Would you? Well, why not?
You got to start somewhere.
You couldn’t do it in better company.
- Look after him, Dodger.
- Hats on, boys. Time we’re off.
- Then I can go, sir?
- Good luck on your first job, my dear.
I'll be waiting for you here when you come back.
- Line up!
- Line up!
- Single file!
- Single file!
- Quick march, left.
- Right.
- Left.
- Right.

Come on!
Come here, boy. Give that back to me.
Give that back, come along.
Stop that boy!
Thief! My wallet! Stop that boy!
Hold that boy!
Stop, thief!
- Leave him to us.
- Stole a gent’s wallet.
We’ll catch him.
He went that way.
- Have you seen him?
- He’s disappeared, he’s gone.
Come here.
Come here, you!
Watch where you’re going!
There’s the gent he stole from.
Can you identify this boy as the thief?
Yes, I saw him run away.
Why didn’t you look after him?
Why didn’t you bring him back with you?
How can I help it?
A fine thing, Oliver in jail, and tomorrow he’ll be before a beak!
For pinching a wallet.
He goes to jail, what’s it matter? l’m afraid he may say something which will get us into trouble.
That’s very likely, Fagin.
You see, you’re blowed upon.
And l’m afraid, you see, that...
...if the game was up with us...
...it might be up with a good many more.
It would come out rather worse for you...
...than it would for me.
Why you miserable, sneaking, treacherous old...
You go down to that court in the morning...
...and you will find out what happens.
Me? Go to court?
With a magistrate sitting there?
I'll go, they won’t know me.
Good girl. Clever girl.
And if he does talk, you’ll come and tell us quick...
..."cause then we’ll have to look after ourselves, won’t we?
You won’t have to look after yourself.
"Cause l’ll look after you, believe me.
I always believe you. Have another drink.
Silence in court.
What crime is this one charged with?
He looks a thorough reprobate, to me.
Speak up, man! What’s he charged with?
He’s not charged, Your Worship.
This gentlemen appears against the boy.
- What boy? I see no boy.
- The boy in the dock, Your Worship.
- Yes. Stand up, boy!
- He is standing up.
Don’t be impertinent.
Put him on a box or something.
- What’s he charged with?
- Picking pockets, sir.
What’s your name, boy?
Does your father know you’re here?
He says he’s an orphan.
Where do you come from?
Where do you live?
Who looks after you?
He doesn’t seem able to say where he lives or anything else.
A liar as well as a thief.
And insolent, too. That settles it.
The boy is committed to three months with hard labour.
This is disgraceful! I demand to be heard.
You have not yet...
- I was there.
- Remove this lunatic! Clear the court.
I will speak, I saw what happened.
He was outside my shop.
Two other boys stole the wallet.
This child had nothing to do with it.
But sentence has been passed!
Hasn’t it?
He didn’t talk. Case was dismissed.
What a great judge! Fetch the boy.
- I’ve done my share.
- Look!
Now, come on.
Where are we going?
At least I can make some amends.
You’re coming home with me. Jump in.
- After them.
- Let the kid go.
- He can still blab on us, can’t he?
- Leave him be.
Don’t lose him.

We’ve got to get him back, do you hear?
Nab him the first time he sets foot out of the door.
He never goes out alone, you know that.
Don’t you back answer me, my girl.
Three days since I spotted him...
...and what have you done about it?
Nothing!
We’ve got to get hold of him somehow.
Now, who’s coming?
- Suppose it'll have to be me.
- Shut your trap, Dodger.
You’ve caused enough trouble already.
It’s going to be done quiet, no fuss.
Someone who has the boy’s confidence...
Nancy, my dear, what do you say?
It’s no good trying it on with me.
And just exactly what do you mean by that remark?
What I say. I’m not going!
Why can’t you leave the boy alone?
He won’t do you no harm!
Why can’t you leave him where he is?
Where he’ll have the chance at a good life?
You’ll bring him back here, my girl...
...unless you want to feel my hand on your throat.
Nancy, my dear, we must have that boy brought back.
If he talked, think what would happen to us. Think what would happen to Bill.
It would be the gallows for him, the drop.
You wouldn’t want that to happen, would you, my dear? Not to Bill.
- She'll go, Fagin.
- No, she won’t!
Yes, she will, Fagin!
She’ll go.

- Can I answer it, Rose?
- Thank you, dear.
- Books from Mr. Jessop.
- Thank you.
- Please sir, these books came for you.
- Good.
- Wait, there’s some to go back.
- Boy’s gone, sir.
Can I take them for you?
I know where the shop is.
Please let me take them. I'll be quick.
All right. Mrs. Bedwin, the books are on the table beside my bed.
You’ll take those books to Mr. Jessop.
Tell him you have come to pay the £4.10 that I owe him.
This is £5 note, so there'll be 10 shillings change.
You understand?
She’s a very pretty lady, isn’t she, sir?
Yes.
I'll take the books for you.
In a new suit, with a set of valuable books, and £5 note in his pocket...
...you expect him back?
- Don’t you?
- If he does, l’ll eat my head with my hat.
- Look at that portrait.
Do you see a likeness to the lad?
- That’s your niece, isn’t it?
- That’s what I mean.
Wasn’t she the girl who...
Who ran away?
A young, innocent face, nothing more.
Mere coincidence. l’m not so sure.
Born in a workhouse at Dunstable, he thinks.
That’s all he can tell us. Very well.
"Who will buy this wonderful morning?"
- "Morning.
- "Morning.
"Such a sky you never did see
"Who will tie it up with a ribbon
And put it in a box for me?"
- Help!
- Get in the cart.
Bull’s-eye, come here.
- Oliver’s back.
- Look at his togs.
- He’s got books, too. Quite the little gent.
- Lovely bit of stuff.
Delighted to see you’re so well, my dear.
Dodger will give you another suit in case you spoil that Sunday one.
Look at this!
I'll bank it for you.
What’s that?
- That’s mine, Fagin.
- No. Mine, ours.
- You shall have the books.
- You hand it over, you old skeleton.
That’s for our share of the trouble.
You keep the books. Start a library.
Mr. Brownlow will be here after you if he finds out you’ve got his books and money.
So he’ll be here, will he?
Out here, after us?
- What did you tell him about us?
- Nothing.
I'll wager this young rat’s told him everything.
What did you tell him?
- No, leave him alone.
- You stand off me.
No violence.
You’ll have to kill me before you lay a hand on that boy.
Don’t you tell me. You keep out of this.
If he says he didn’t tell them, he didn’t tell them.
Hit me, would you?
I won’t stand by and see it done.
Let him be, or l’ll put my mark on you...
Nancy, you’re wonderful tonight!
Such talent! Such a joker!
You take care, I don’t know, but do it, Fagin...
...or l’ll put the finger on all of you, and I don’t care if I hang for it.
- Do you know who you are? What you are?
- You don’t have to tell me.
- A fine one for the boy to make a friend of.
- Yes, I am, God help me.
And I wish l’d been struck down dead before l’d laid a hand to bring him back.
From tonight he’s a liar...
...and a thief, and all that’s bad.
Ain’t that enough for you without beating him to death?
Come, come, Sikes.
We must have civil words.
Yes, you deserve them from me, don’t you?
I thieved for you when I was half his age.
- It’s your dirty work I been doing since.
- It’s a living isn’t it?
- He’s right, Nancy, a living is a living.
- Some living, Lord help me. Some living!
Get to bed, all of you.
Get to bed, I said!
All this violence, all these scenes, screams, dramas! l’m asking you, is it necessary?
Not yet, Fagin.
But if this godforsaken little good-for-nothing’s uttered one word...
If he has, the little devil...
...we sit down, talk it over, we think it out, we decide a safe action, we stay calm.
Do we? And while we’re sitting here...
...thinking, and talking, and staying calm...
...our collars get felt.
And it’s, "Come with me, if you please."
No, thank you.
You thought us into this lot.
You can think your way out of it.
From now on, Bill Sikes takes the law into his own hands.
These hands.
Have you ever heard the sound of a chicken getting its neck wrung?
Can’t say I have...
They squawk, Fagin, they squawk.
Not a very pretty sound.
No, Bill.
And then they die, don’t they?
Yes. I mean, no.
They say some even start squawking before that even.
They get what you might call a premonition.
You’re wouldn’t be having no premonition of that sort, would you?
Not me, Bill. The lips are sealed. l’m glad. Because if anyone here should lead the law to me...
...and I gets to hear of it, then it will be your neck.
Your scraggy old neck.
You think about it, Fagin.
A violent man, Dodger.
A very violent man.
When that man’s back is up, no one is safe.
Look after him, Dodger.
And l’ll look after myself.
A man’s got a heart, hasn’t he?
Joking apart, hasn’t he?
"Though l’d be the first one to say that I wasn’t a saint
"l’m finding it hard to be really as black as they paint
"l’m reviewing the situation:
"Can a fellow be a villain all his life?
"All the trials and tribulation!
Better settle down and get meself a wife
"And the wife would cook and sew for me
And come for me, and go for me
"And go for me and nag at me
The finger she would wag at me
"The money she would take from me
A misery, she’d make from me
"I think l’d better think it out again!
"A wife you can keep, anyway l’d rather sleep, anyway
"Left without anyone in the world
And l’m starting from now
"So, how to win friends and to influence people?
"So, how?
"l’m reviewing the situation
"I must quickly look up everyone I know:
"Titled people with a station
Who’ll help me make an impressive show!
"I will own a suite at Coleridge’s and run a fleet of carriages
"And wave at all the duchesses
With friendliness, as much as is
"Befitting of my new estate
Good morrow to you, Magistrate!
"I think l’d better think it out again
"So, where shall I go? Somebody?
"Who do I know? Nobody!
"All my dearest companions
Have always been villains and thieves
"So, at my time of life I should start
Turning over new leaves?
"l’m reviewing the situation:
"If you want to eat you’ve got to earn a bob!
"Is it such a humiliation
For a robber to perform an honest job?
"So a job l’m getting, possibly
I wonder who my boss'll be?
"I wonder if he’ll take to me?
What bonuses he’ll make to me?
"I'll start at 8:00, finish late
At normal rate, and all, but wait!
"I think l’d better think it out
"I think l’d better think it out again
"What happens when l’m 70?
"Must come a time, 70
"When you’re old, and it’s cold
And who cares if you live or you die?
"Your one consolation’s the money
You may have put by
"l’m reviewing the situation:
"l’m a bad 'un and a bad 'un I shall stay!
"You’ll be seeing no transformation
But it’s wrong to be a rogue in every way
"I don’t want nobody hurt for me
Or made to do the dirt for me
"This rotten life is not for me
It’s getting far too hot for me
"There is no in-between for me
But who will change the scene for me?
"Don’t want no one to rob for me
But who will find a job for me?
"I think l’d better think it out again!"
So, when I heard about dear little Oliver,
I decided to come to London.
- I decided.
- It was good of you to come.
What have you got to tell me?
This locket once belonged to the boy’s mother.
Found by the wife after she passed away.
The boy’s mother, that is, not my dear wife.
- You’ve kept this all these years?
- Why should I not?
Didn’t it occur to you that it might provide the answer to the boy’s parentage?
- His identity! His name!
- He had none. The mother was unmarried.
It is your clear duty to show this evidence to some higher authority.
- Your behaviour, madam, was shameful.
- How dare you speak to me so!
I only came here to help you.
You came here to profit from your own greed and dishonesty.
- You don’t think it belongs to my wife?
- Be quiet.
Your reward and something for the locket.
Your lucky you’re not in the law’s hands.
- Show these people out.
- There’s gratitude for you!
I hope this unfortunate circumstance won’t deprive me of my parochial office?
My hope, sir, is that it will.
But it was all Mrs. Bumble.
I knew nothing till yesterday.
No excuse. In the eyes of the law you are the more guilty of the two.
The law supposes your wife acts under your direction.
If that’s what the law supposes, sir, then the law’s an ass.
If that’s the eye of the law, sir, then law’s a bachelor.
The worst I wish the law is that it’s eye be opened by experience. By experience!
Sir, the locket, I didn’t really see it.
I recognised it at once. I gave it to my niece, Emily, on her 18th birthday.
So it wasn’t just her young man jilting her that made her run away?
No.
She must have made her way to that workhouse and had her baby there.
What’s going on?
- Why have you brought the boy here?
- "Cause he’s coming on a job...
...with me.
But, why him?
Because I need a little one. That’s why.
And he’s nice and thin.
And on this particular job, that’s what counts.
Must I go?
One word out of you...
...while you’re out with me and you know what will happen.
Bill, you can’t do this to him.
Please! You can’t!
- I won’t let you...
- No more of that.
You just be at the tavern at 11:00.
- I’ve come about Oliver. Tell Brownlow...
- You better come inside. Mr. Brownlow!
- No. I just want to leave a message.
- But he’ll want to see you.
- Please! I can’t stay!
- Sir, this person wants to...
- Who is it?
- It’s about the boy, sir.
- Is there news of him?
- He’s in danger.
He was dragged off the day you sent him out.
- Who took him?
- Me and someone else.
- You took him by force?
- Yes!
- Now I wish I had never been part of it.
- Where is he now?
Who is this other person?
Can you take me to him?
You want to help the boy.
Why else are you here?
- Then tell me where he is!
- I can’t!
I'll bring him to you. Not here. It’s too far.
Where, then?
London Bridge, tonight at midnight.
But you’ve got to come alone.
Promise you’ll come on your own!
You don’t trust me, do you?
But you’ve got to.
- I'll be there.
- Thank God. Let me go.
Wait! Is the boy hurt, ill-treated?
I can’t say no more. Please!
He’ll kill me as it is if he finds out.
- Who is this man?
- No, I won’t tell you.
Whatever I do, I won’t turn on him.
You wouldn’t understand. l’ve got to go back.
I want to go back.
- Promise you’ll come?
- At 12:00.
Remember, you little worm, the front door.
There.
Hurry!
Look above you.
Who is it? Who’s there?
Rufus! Dragon! Come down, seize him!
Seize him! Good dog!
Why worry, my dear? He always turns up!
Maybe he’s taken Oliver back to my place.
- He said he was coming straight here.
- And that’s what he’ll do.
- Everything all right, Bill?
- No it’s not, Fagin.
- The brat woke them up. We had to run.
- Anybody see you?
No.
I'll just take the boy and put him to bed.
I'll be back.
Put him back.

Bull’s-eye...
Bull’s-eye, watch him, will you? Go on!

There’s blood on your coat.

Bill Sikes, what did you do?
She won’t peach on nobody no more.
You shouldn’t have done that.
- She peached? Are you sure?
- She must have, mustn’t she?
She was handing the boy over to Brownlow on the bridge.
He was there, waiting for her.
What did you come here for?
Get out! Do you hear? Get out!

Man: GET THIS ON THE TWIX,
WILL YOU, NELL?
I'VE SAID IT ONCE,
I'VE SAID IT A HUNDRED TIMES!
I KNOW, D.J.
NOW, ABOUT SEATTLE --
DON'T MISS THE MEETING
ON THE 23rd.
Woman: MR. MULROONEY,
- THE BOSTON PLANE IS ON TIME.
THEN I'D BETTER BE GOING.
CAN'T KEEP THESE PEOPLE WAITING.
HOW ABOUT
THE HENDERSON DEAL?
I WANTED YOU TO OKAY THIS,
D.J.
OH, NOT ANOTHER ELECTRONICS
COMPANY, PAUL.
WELL, WE CAN PICK IT UP
FOR A SONG,
AND SINCE WE'VE GONE
INTO PLASTICS SO HEAVILY --
PLASTICS, TOYS,
ELECTRONICS -- WHAT NEXT?
THERE'S ONE THING
YOU YOUNG FELLOWS
SEEM TO FORGET --
WE ARE IN THE LUMBER BUSINESS.
WE STARTED OUT IN LUMBER,
AND LUMBER IS STILL NUMBER ONE.
OF COURSE, D.J.
BUT IF IT'LL MAKE YOU HAPPY,
GO AHEAD AND BUY IT.
WELL, THANK YOU, SIR!
OH, NOT THAT ONE, GREGG --
THE ROLLS.
THE ROLLS -- RIGHT, SIR.
MAY I HAVE YOUR UNDIVIDED
ATTENTION FOR 30 SECONDS?
YES, RALPH.
I CAN'T EMPHASIZE ENOUGH
THE SUCCESS
OF THE SEATTLE DEAL
DEPENDS ON YOUR BEING THERE.
WELL, I'LL DO MY BEST
TO MAKE IT,
BUT IN CASE I MISS,
YOU'VE GOT ALL THE FACTS.
THEY DON'T WANT ME
OR LOGAN OR WINKLER!
THEY'VE BEEN PROMISED
D.J. MULROONEY.
THEY WANT THAT 50,000 ACRES
OF TIMBER! THAT'S OUR BAIT!
BUT IF YOU'RE NOT
IN SEATTLE,
THE WHOLE DEAL
GOES DOWN THE DRAIN.
I'LL BE THERE, RALPH.
NOW, WILL YOU PLEASE
STOP WORRYING?
AH, THERE SHE IS --
AS BEAUTIFUL AS THE DAY
I FIRST BROUGHT HER HOME.
WE HAD JUST PUT TOGETHER
THAT SAGATUCK LUMBER DEAL.
AND ALL THE PROFITS
WENT RIGHT INTO THIS CAR.
I REMEMBER PERFECTLY.
THAT WAS IN THE DAYS
WHEN I ONLY HAD $1 MILLION.
YOU STILL
HAVE TO IMPRESS PEOPLE.
I'LL BE DOING MY OWN DRIVING.
YES, SIR.
SPECIAL OCCASION.
I'M MEETING
SOME VERY IMPORTANT PEOPLE.
YOU'VE ONLY GOT A HALF AN HOUR
TO GET TO THE AIRPORT.
DON'T WORRY, I'LL MAKE IT.
I ALWAYS DO, DON'T I?
[ TIRES SCREECH ]
FIVE MINUTES EARLY!
WHY DON'T YOU RUN
YOUR PLANES ON TIME?!
IT WAS THE TAIL WIND,
MR. MULROONEY!
WELL, IT'S VERY IMPORTANT
THAT I SHOULD BE HERE
TO MEET THEM.
WHERE ARE THEY?!
WHERE --
GRANDFATHER!
HI, GRANDFATHER.
HI, RODNEY.
MY GOODNESS,
BUT YOU'VE GROWN!
AND ELIZABETH...
YOU LOOK MORE LIKE YOUR MOTHER
EVERY TIME I SEE YOU.
HOW IS SHE?
FINE. SHE TOLD ME
TO GIVE YOU HER LOVE.
AND DAD SAID HE'LL BRING YOU
CHAMPAGNE FROM PARIS.
THAT'S THE SORT OF
SON-IN-LAW I LIKE.
HOW WERE THESE PASSENGERS?
WELL BEHAVED, I HOPE?
THE PERFECT TRAVELERS.
IT WAS A PLEASURE TO HAVE THEM.
GOODBYE, ELIZABETH.
- GOODBYE.
GOODBYE, RODNEY.
[ CHUCKLES ]
WHERE ARE WE GOING,
GRANDFATHER?
I THOUGHT MAYBE WE'D
HEAD UP THE REDWOOD HIGHWAY.
I USED TO TAKE YOUR MOTHER THERE
WHEN SHE WAS YOUR AGE.
THEN WE'LL FOLLOW OUR NOSES
ON UP TO SEATTLE.
SEATTLE!
CAN WE GO ON THE YACHT?!
I'VE GOT A NEW ONE NOW --
4,000 HORSEPOWER DIESEL.
DOES 25 KNOTS
IF SHE'S PUSHED.
OH, BOY!
COST NEARLY
$1 MILLION DOLLARS.
WELL, HOW COME
IF YOU'RE SO RICH
YOU DRIVE A FUNNY OLD CAR
LIKE THIS?
FUNNY OLD CAR?!
I TELL YOU, YOUNG MAN,
THIS IS A FINE CAR!
YOU WON'T FIND ITS LIKE
ANYMORE.
WELL, IT'S CERTAINLY
A PRETTY CAR.
YES, BUT HOW FAST
DOES IT GO?
OH, FAST ENOUGH
TO GET US THERE.
WHEN I GET A CAR,
IT'S GONNA BE A MASERATI.
RODNEY, YOU'RE ALWAYS
TALKING SO BIG!
THERE'S NO HARM
IN THAT, SON.
WHEN I WAS A YOUNG LAD
IN IRELAND,
I ALWAYS DREAMT OF OWNING MYSELF
A JAUNTING CAR.
A JAUNTING CAR?
NEVER HEARD OF THAT MAKE.
WELL, RODNEY, MY BOY,
IT WAS THE MASERATI
OF ITS TIME -- REAL COOL.

LUNCHTIME.
GREAT!
WHERE'S THE RESTAURANT?
RIGHT HERE -- I THOUGHT
IT WOULD BE FUN
TO HAVE OUR FIRST MEAL TOGETHER
IN THE OPEN AIR!
LOOK, RODNEY!
"MULROONEY GROVE."
GRANDFATHER, ARE THESE
WONDERFUL TREES ALL YOURS?
EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM --
MINE, YOURS, EVERYBODY'S.
WHAT DID YOU DO,
BUY 'EM?
ALL THAT SIGN MEANS IS
THAT I HAD THE PRIVILEGE
OF SEEIN' THAT
THEY'LL ALWAYS BE HERE.
JUST FOR PEOPLE TO LOOK AT?
EXACTLY.
MY, THEY'RE BIG!
MUST HAVE TAKEN
A LONG TIME TO GROW.
4,000 YEARS
FOR SOME OF THEM.
TUNA...
HAM...
IT'S SO BEAUTIFUL...
LIKE BEING IN FAIRYLAND.
NOW, DON'T GO
TOO FAR AWAY NOW.
RODNEY'S HUNGRY,
AND THERE MIGHT NOT BE
ANYTHING LEFT
WHEN YOU GET BACK.
THERE'S NO PEANUT BUTTER
AND JELLY.
OH, DIG DOWN.
THEY'RE PROBABLY
DOWN THERE IN THE BOTTOM.
YOU KNOW, SHE --
SHE COULD BE THE ONE.
I WOULDN'T IF I WERE YOU.
DON'T DO IT.
WELL, BUT OF ALL OF 'EM
I'VE SEEN,
SHE'S THE ONE
I THINK I COULD TRUST.
YOU CAN'T TRUST ANY OF 'EM.
THAT'S RIGHT, THAT'S RIGHT!
BUT I HAVE TO TALK
TO SOMEONE.
TALK TO ME...
ANY TIME.
AND US --
JUST AS MUCH AS YOU LIKE.
I HAVE TALKED TO YA --
ALL OF YA --
AND THERE'S NOT ONE OF YOU THAT
CAN HELP ME WITH MY PROBLEM!
DON'T DO IT, JASPER.
ONLY MEAN TROUBLE.
WHAT TROUBLE?!
GNOME HUNTERS, THAT'S WHAT!
GNOME HUNTERS
ALL OVER THE PLACE!
OUR WOODS WILL BE FULL OF 'EM!
AND NONE OF 'EM
CAN KEEP THEIR MOUTHS SHUT!
BLAB, BLAB, BLAB!
NO PEACE FOR ANY OF US
ANYMORE.
NO PEACE AT ALL.
NO PEACE AT ALL.
MY MIND'S MADE UP.
AAH!
I, UH, DIDN'T MEAN
TO FRIGHTEN YA.
OH, YOU DIDN'T.
BUT I'LL BET YOU'RE SURPRISED
TO SEE A GNOME.
OH, NOT REALLY.
I WAS JUST THINKING
WHAT A LOVELY PLACE
THIS IS FOR GNOMES.
ARE THERE MANY OF YOU
LIVING HERE?
WELL,
THAT'S MY PROBLEM.
IF IT WEREN'T FOR THAT,
I WOULDN'T BE SHOWIN' MYSELF
TO A DOO-DEEN.
A DOO-DEEN?
THAT'S WHAT WE CALL
YOU BIG PEOPLE.
AM I THE FIRST DOO-DEEN
YOU'VE EVER SPOKEN TO?
YEAH, YEAH.
ALL MY FRIENDS
ADVISED AGAINST IT,
BUT I HAD TO TALK
TO SOMEONE!
IF I'M THE FIRST DOO-DEEN
YOU'VE EVER SPOKEN TO,
HOW SHOULD YOU SPEAK
SUCH GOOD ENGLISH?
UH, ENGLISH?
THE LANGUAGE
WE'VE BEEN TALKING!
WELL,
DON'T THAT BEAT ALL?!
AND HERE
I'VE BEEN WONDERIN'
HOW YOU SPOKE
SUCH GOOD GNOMISH!
AND ME FATHER NO MORE THAN TOOK
HIS EYES OFF THE LEPRECHAUN
FOR LESS TIME
THAN IT TAKES TO SAY,
"SEANNY O'SHANNON'S SHILLELAGH,"
WHEN WOOSH!
THE LITTLE CREATURE
UP AND DISAPPEARED ON 'EM.
YOU DON'T REALLY BELIEVE
IN THAT SILLY STUFF,
DO YOU, GRANDFATHER?
THERE'S STILL
NO PEANUT BUTTER.
OH, THEY PROBABLY
GOT THE LABELS MIXED.
GRANDFATHER, COME QUICKLY!
I PROMISED HIM WE'D BE BACK!
PROMISED WHO?
THE GNOME!
- THE WHAT?!
THE GNOME, AND HE'S GOT
A SIMPLY AWFUL PROBLEM!
OH, NOT JUST A GNOME,
BUT A GNOME WITH A PROBLEM!
NOW, THAT IS SOMETHING!
HEY, I FOUND ONE!
GRANDFATHER, HE'S WAITING
TO TALK TO YOU!
BUT WHY ME?
BECAUSE I TOLD HIM
IF ANYONE COULD HELP HIM
WITH HIS PROBLEM, IT WAS YOU!
HE'S WAITING!
WELL, COME ON, RODNEY.
WE GOT TO GO TALK
TO A GNOME.
NOW, ELIZABETH...
ON THE POSSIBILITY
THIS FELLOW ISN'T THERE --
ABOUT 6 INCHES HIGH?
TALLER THAN THAT.
LITTLE YELLOW CAP
AND BUCKLES ON HIS SHOES?
HIS HAT WAS GREEN.
IN ALL THE STORIES
ABOUT LEPRECHAUNS --
I DIDN'T SAY
HE WAS A LEPRECHAUN!
HE SAID HE WAS A GNOME!
OH, A GNOME!
WELL, THAT'S DIFFERENT!
THAT'S THE PLACE!
I'M HERE -- I'VE BROUGHT HIM!
YOO-HOO!
JASPER!
HIS NAME'S JASPER.
OH?
JASPER!
JASPER!
JASPER!
JASPER!
JASPER!
JASPER!
THE GIRL -- ALL RIGHT.
I MAYBE COULD GO ALONG.
BUT HOW ABOUT HIM?
YOU EVER SEEN
A FIERCER-LOOKIN' CRITTER?
HE, UH --
HE DOES LOOK AWFUL SHIFTY
ABOUT THE EYES.
JASPER! JASPER!
MAYBE THIS IS
THE WRONG PLACE.
FORESTS CAN FOOL YOU.
BUT, GRANDFATHER,
THIS WAS THE PLACE!
IT COULD BE
THE LITTLE LEP-- GNOME
HAD SECOND THOUGHTS --
ON SEEING ME, I MEAN.
NOW, A LITTLE GIRL --
THAT'S ONE THING,
BUT AN OLD CURMUDGEON
LIKE MYSELF...
[ CRYING ]
AND IT COULD BE
IN HER IMAGINATION, TOO.
I DIDN'T IMAGINE HIM!
I DID SEE HIM!
OF COURSE YOU SAW
A GNOME, DARLING,
BUT NOT WITH THESE EYES --
THESE UP HERE.
THAT'S WHERE
ALL THE LITTLE FOLKS LIVE,
LIKE GNOMES, ELVES,
LEPRECHAUNS.
BUT, GRANDFATHER,
HONEST, I TALKED TO HIM!
JASPER, JASPER!
They're makin' her into a fool, and all on account of me!
COME ON, DARLING,
WE BEST BE GETTING BACK.
NOW, YOU MUST BE
REALLY HUNGRY --
BUT HE WAS RIGHT THERE!
HE WAS RIGHT THERE!
I can't let it end like this.
HEY, YOU!
SHE DID, TOO, SEE A GNOME!
WHO SAID THAT?!
I THINK IT'S HIM!
Uh-oh.
Now you done it!
COME ON OUT
AND SHOW YOURSELF!
DON'T DO IT, JASPER,
DON'T DO IT!
WHAT KIND OF A TRICK IS THAT
TO PLAY ON A LITTLE GIRL?!
COME ON, DARLING.
OH, GRANDFATHER.
HOLD ON, YOU!
JASPER!
SEANNY O'SHANNON'S
SHILLELAGH!
THERE, GRANDFATHER, YOU SEE?
WHY, UH...
YES...
A GNOME.
YOU SEE HIM, RODNEY?
I STILL THINK
IT'S ELIZABETH'S IMAGINATION.
JASPER, THIS IS
MY BROTHER RODNEY
AND MY GRANDFATHER.
GLAD TO SEE YOU, JASPER.
SAY HELLO TO HIM, RODNEY.
HI.
IS THIS THE WIZARD --
THE ONE WITH ALL THE SOLUTIONS?
SO, YOU'RE THE GNOME
WITH THE PROBLEM.
TELL HIM WHAT YOU TOLD ME!
WELL, INSTEAD OF THAT,
SINCE SEEIN' IS BELIEVIN'
WITH YOU DOO-DEENS,
FOLLOW ME!
COME ON!
WELL, THERE'S MY PROBLEM.
MY OLD GRANDPA JUST LIES THERE
GROWIN' MORE SEE-THROUGHISH
WITH EVERY PASSIN' HOUR.
WHAT'S MAKING HIM
SO SEE-THROUGHISH?
WELL, I'M NOT
AN AUTHORITY ON GNOMES,
BUT IF THEY'RE ANYTHING
LIKE LEPRECHAUNS,
THEY LIVE ON AND ON...
BUT ONLY IF THEY WANT TO.
YOU MEAN
THEY JUST FADE AWAY?
JASPER, HAVE YOU ANY IDEA
WHAT MADE HIM LOSE
HIS WILL TO LIVE?
[ SIGHS ]
GRANDPA'S GIVEN UP ALL HOPE
OF EVER SEEIN' ME MARRIED
AND HAVIN' YOUNGUNS
OF MY OWN.
WHY IS THAT?
WELL...
GRANDPA AND ME,
WE'RE, UH...
WE'RE THE LAST OF THE GNOMES.
THERE'S NO GNOME MAIDENS
FOR ME TO MARRY UP WITH.
WELL, NOW, THAT IS
A SERIOUS PROBLEM.
JASPER...
JASPER, BOY...
IS THAT YOU I HEAR?
I-IT IS, GRANDPA.
I'M, UH -- I'M TALKIN'
WITH SOME FRIENDS.
OH...THAT'S NICE.
THAT'S NICE.
I'M HAPPY FOR YA.
T-THEY'RE, UH...
DOO-DEEN FRIENDS.
MMM, GOOD, GOOD.
NOW, GO A-- DOO-DEENS!
NOW, GRANDPA,
THEY MEAN TO HELP US!
YOU GONE PLUMB
OUT OF YOUR SENSES?!
IT'S DOO-DEENS THAT'S BEEN
THE CAUSE OF ALL OUR TROUBLE!
THESE BIG ONES
ARE DIFFERENT!
THERE AIN'T NO SUCH A THING
AS A DIFFERENT DOO-DEEN!
THAT'S WHY
IN ALL MY 900 YEARS,
I NEVER LET ONE OF 'EM SO MUCH
AS LAY AN EYE ON MY BOOT!
NOW, GRANDPA, IF I MAY --
NOT ONE STEP FURTHER!
AILIN' I MAY BE,
BUT NOT ENOUGH
TO LET YOU GET AHOLD OF ME
WITHOUT PUTTIN' UP A FIGHT!
BUT MY GRANDFATHER
JUST WANTED TO HELP.
HELP?! SAYIN' YOU COULD HELP,
WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO?!
BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT A PROBLEM,
AND MY GRANDFATHER IS GOOD
AT SOLVING PROBLEMS.
WELL, YOU DON'T SAY.
JASPER TOLD ME THAT THERE
ARE RUMORS ABOUT GNOMES
LIVING IN OTHER FORESTS.
AH, IDLE CLUCKIN'
OF GOSSIPY ANIMALS!
AND GRANDFATHER'S GOT
A WONDERFUL CAR,
AND HE'LL DRIVE YOU ANYWHERE,
WON'T YOU, GRANDFATHER?
NOW, JUST A MINUTE, DARLIN'.
AND WHAT ABOUT THE YACHT?!
OH, PLEASE, GRANDFATHER!
WELL, DEAR, I DO HAVE TO BE
IN SEATTLE.
SUPPOSIN' I WAS
TO GO WITH YOU --
I HEAR TELL HOW YOU BIG ONES
TREAT FREE THINGS
IN THE FOREST --
HOW YOU PUT 'EM IN CAGES
AND SELL 'EM AS CURIOSITIES --
EXHIBIT 'EM
TO OTHER DOO-DEENS!
OH, WE'D NEVER DO THAT,
WOULD WE, GRANDFATHER?!
WE'LL GIVE YOU OUR WORD
WE WON'T MENTION
YOUR EXISTENCE
TO ANOTHER SOUL!
NOBODY'D BELIEVE US, ANYWAY.
IT'S OUR ONLY CHANCE,
GRANDPA.
WHAT DO YOU SAY?
NOT THAT I GOT ANY HOPES
OF FINDIN' GNOMES, MIND YOU,
BUT YOU DO GOT SOMEWHAT OF AN
HONORABLE LOOK ABOUT YOUR EYES.
YAHOO, WE'RE GOING!
YAHOO!
OH, GRANDFATHER,
YOU'RE WONDERFUL!
YIPPEE!
WE'RE GOING!
WELL, IF I MAY COIN A PHRASE,
HE'S JUMPIN' OUT OF

WELL, I MUST SAY,
JASPER WAS RIGHT FOR ONCE.
YOU DOO-DEENS ARE DIFFERENT.
THANKS, GRANDPA.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
KEEP CALLIN' ME GRANDPA.
THE NAME'S KNOBBY.
KNOBBY, JUST CALL ME D.J.
EVERYONE DOES.
D.J. -- DON'T COME
MUCH SHORTER THAN THAT.
GRANDFATHER, WHERE DO WE START
THIS GNOME HUNTING?
I FIGURE THE MOST LIKELY PLACE
WOULD BE A VIRGIN FOREST.
NOW, I HAPPEN TO KNOW
OF A 50,000-ACRE PATCH OF TIMBER
THAT'S NEVER BEEN TOUCHED BY --
BY DOO-DEENS.
IS IT VERY FAR?
WE CAN'T MAKE IT TONIGHT.
WE'LL HAVE TO STOP OVER
SOMEWHERE.
BUT WE'LL MAKE IT EASY
IN THE MORNING.
JASPER, WHAT HAPPENED
TO ALL THE OTHER GNOMES?
WELL, I WAS TOO LITTLE
TO REMEMBER MUCH ABOUT IT,
BUT I'VE HEARD IT SAID
THAT THEY MIGRATED.
WEREN'T THAT AT ALL!
WHAT ABOUT
THE FOOD GETTIN' SCARCE?
I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU HEARD!
I WAS THERE!
IT WAS THE CHOPPIN' DOWN
OF THE TREES
THAT MADE
THE GNOMES DISAPPEAR!
I REMEMBER IT
LIKE IT WAS YESTERDAY!
EVERYTHING WAS SO PLEASANT
AND PEACEFUL --
EVERYBODY MINDIN'
THEIR OWN BUSINESS.
THEN, ALL OF A SUDDEN,
"TIMBER!"
TREES STARTED
A-COMIN' DOWN, A-FALLIN'.
AND A-CRASHIN' LIKE GIANTS,
THEY COME DOWN!
IT WAS "TIMBER!" ON THE RIGHT
AND "TIMBER!" ON THE LEFT,
AND THE GNOMES A-PANICKIN'
AND A-RUNNIN'
AND A-FALLIN' DOWN
AND A-BUMPIN' INTO EACH OTHER,
AND COMIN' RIGHT BEHIND 'EM
ALL THE TIME
WAS THE BIG AXES A-SLASHIN'
AND A-CUTTIN' AND "TIMBER!"
GRANDPA, I REMEMBER --
YOU DON'T REMEMBER NOTHIN'!
YOU WEREN'T NO BIGGER THAN THAT!
I GRABBED YOU
AND STARTED TO RUN!
AND RIGHT BEHIND ME I HEAR,
"TIMBER!"
AND I LOOKED BACK
OVER MY SHOULDER,
AND HERE COME ONE OF THEM GIANTS
FALLIN' RIGHT AT ME!
HOW DID YOU ESCAPE?
I DIDN'T!
IT LANDED RIGHT ON ME!
DID IT KILL YOU?!
NOPE. I DUCKED
DOWN A RABBIT HOLE.
BUT I WAS UNDER THAT TREE
FOR 40 DAYS AND 40 NIGHTS!
AND WHEN I FINALLY
DUG MYSELF OUT,
THERE WERE DEAD TREES
EVERYWHERE
AND NARY A GNOME IN SIGHT!
HOW AWFUL!
OH, THE CARNAGE!
AND THEM INFERNAL
AXE-SWINGERS --
THEY WOULDN'T GIVE UP!
THEY KEPT A-COMIN' AND A-COMIN'!
AND THE WORST OF 'EM ALL
WAS THAT MULROONEY OUTFIT!

- BUT, GRANDFATHER!
SHH! DON'T INTERRUPT
WHILE HE'S TALKING!
I NEVER SEEN
THE BLACKGUARD HIMSELF,
BUT I SEEN THEM HENCHMEN
OF HIS OFTEN ENOUGH --
A-SLASHIN' AND A-CUTTIN'
AND A-DESTROYIN'!

WE CALLED 'EM!
NOW, JUST A MINUTE!
IT SO HAPPENS
THAT MY GRANDFATHER IS --
IN COMPLETE ACCORD
WITH YOU, KNOBBY!

INDISCRIMINATELY OUGHT TO BE --
WELL, HE OUGHT TO BE TAKEN OUT

HAVE GOTTEN KIDNAPPED?!

HAVE TO FIND THE ANSWER TO!

IT'S THE OLD MULROONEY LUCK.
FALL IN A GLASSHOUSE
AND COME UP SMELLIN' LIKE A...
PETUNIA.
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.
[ ALARM BLARING ]
WHAT'S WRONG?!
HE'S GONE!
D.J. -- OH, NO!
FASTER, GRANDFATHER!
I'M GOIN' AS FAST AS I CAN!
THERE HE IS!
COME ON!
AFTER HIM, DUKE!
[ DOG BARKS ]
UP OVER THE TREE!
WATCH OUT, GRANDFATHER!
[ BARKING ]
COME ON, GRANDFATHER!
GRANDFATHER!
[ BLARING CONTINUES ]
[ GROWLING ]
COME ON, GRANDFATHER!
D.J., COME BACK!
COME BACK!
HELP ME!
[ ENGINE TURNS OVER ]
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE IT, D.J.
ANYBODY ON OUR TAIL?
NOBODY IN SIGHT.
WHAT DO WE DO NOW?
CAN'T SAY, DARLIN',
BUT ONE THING'S FOR SURE.
WHATEVER IT IS,
WE DO IT ALONE.
SURE CAN'T COUNT
ON THAT MULROONEY TEAM.
THE FIRST QUESTION IS,
WHO COULD HAVE SEEN
THE GNOMES?
THE DESK CLERK?
I DOUBT IT.
MAYBE THE BELLBOY!
I KNOW! THE FELLOW
WITH THE FANTASTIC FREAKS!
FANTASTIC FREAKS?
HE WAS IN THE LOBBY
PUTTING UP POSTERS,
AND HE GAVE ME THESE.
UH-HUH --
"QUAXTON'S FANTASTIC FREAKS.
"HIGHWAY 175,
SOUTH OF HOMERVILLE," HUH?
RODNEY, MY BOY,
YOU'VE JUST HIT
ON A VERY POSSIBLE
POSSIBILITY.
D.J.: HERE IT IS.
Rodney: SURE IS
A CRUMMY-LOOKING PLACE.
Elizabeth: OH, I DO HOPE
THEY'RE ALL RIGHT.
YOU TWO WAIT HERE.
THIS SHOULDN'T TAKE LONG.
QUAXTON!
HOLD IT, YOU!
WHAT'S HAPPENIN', CHA--
BREAKIN' AND ENTERIN',
LOOKS LIKE TO ME!
BREAKING AND ENTERING?!
LOOK -- "FIVE OAKS"!
AIN'T THAT SOME KIND OF
A NUTHOUSE OR SOMETHIN'?!
I'M PERFECTLY SANE,
AND I CAN EXPLAIN ALL THIS!
GET ON THE PHONE, ETTA.
CALL THE COPS.
I'LL KEEP THE LOONY COVERED.
IF YOU TELL ME WHERE I CAN FIND
QUAXTON, I'LL BE ON MY WAY!
ETTA, CALL THE COPS!
GRAB 'EM, MEN!
FREEZE, MISTER!
I DON'T CARE WHETHER
YOU BELIEVE ME OR NOT.
I WANNA KNOW WHERE
THIS QUAXTON FELLER IS!
THERE'S NO TIME TO ARGUE!
TWO LIVES ARE AT STAKE!
AND I'M WARNING YOU,
I YOU HOLD ANYTHING BACK
AND ANYTHING HAPPENS
TO THOSE TWO --
TO THOSE TWO LIVES,
I'LL PERSONALLY SEE TO IT
THAT BOTH OF YOU
ARE ARRESTED AS ACCOMPLICES!
LOOK, MISTER, WE ONLY WORK
FOR QUAXTON!
YOU DON'T BELIEVE THIS LOONY?!
I BELIEVE ALMOST ANYTHING
ABOUT HORATIO QUAXTON!
AND THAT PHONE CALL --
QUIET!
QUAXTON'S UP TO SOMETHIN',
AND YOU KNOW IT!
WHAT PHONE CALL?!
FIVE OR SIX HOURS AGO,
HE SAID WE WAS TO RUN THINGS
TILL HE GOT BACK.
GOT BACK FROM WHERE?!
HIS MOUNTAIN CABIN, PROBABLY.
I TOLD YOU TO KEEP QUIET!
WHERE IS IT?!
SOMEWHERE AROUND HOMERVILLE --
A ROAD CALLED "OLD WILLOW."
BUT WE AIN'T SURE
HE'S THERE, MIND YOU,
BUT HE COULD BE.
WELL, IN CASE
WE DON'T FIND HIM THERE,
AND YOU HEAR
FROM HIM AGAIN,
THERE'S DOUBLE THAT
IN IT FOR YA.
[ CAR DOOR CLOSES,
ENGINE TURNS OVER ]
OH, CHARLIE, LOOK!
"I OWE YOU $5,000 --
D.J. MULROONEY."
HUH!
TOLD YOU HE WAS TETCHED.
FILL 'ER UP.
HOLD IT A MINUTE.
HOW MUCH MONEY
YOU KIDS GOT?
39 CENTS.
HOW ABOUT YOU, ELIZABETH?
UM, A QUARTER
AND TWO NICKELS.
BETTER MAKE IT 2 GALLONS.
A MAN NAMED QUAXTON
HAS A CABIN AROUND HERE.
DO YOU KNOW WHERE IT IS?
NOPE.
DO YOU KNOW HIM?
NOPE.
WELL, I KNOW HE HAS
A PLACE HERE.
WELL, THAT PUTS YOU
ONE UP ON ME, DON'T IT?
HOW ABOUT THE OLD WILLOW ROAD?
DO YOU KNOW WHERE THAT IS?
YEP.
WELL, WHERE?!
ABOUT TWO DIRT ROADS
BACK.
THANKS.
THAT'S 72 CENTS.
HERE'S 74 --
KEEP THE CHANGE.
LAST OF THE BIG SPENDERS.
[ RATTLING ]
Knobby: OH, WHY DID I
EVER LEAVE MY REDWOODS?
THIS IS ALL MY FAULT,
JASPER.
Jasper: I'LL GET YOU
OUT OF HERE.
IF I HAD SENSE ENOUGH
TO STAY WHERE I BELONG,
WE'D NEVER BE
IN THIS MESS.
IT'S NO USE, JASPER.
NOW, GRANDPA,
WE'LL GET OUT OF HERE,
BUT WE GOT TO DO IT
BEFORE HE GETS BACK.
DON'T BOTHER ABOUT ME.
I'M ONLY A BURDEN TO YA.
I'M TOO OLD.
NOW, GRANDPA...
ENDIN' UP
COOPED UP LIKE THIS!
OH!
COME ON, GRANDPA.
[ GROANS ]
OH, ME POOR LEGS!
I CAN'T EVEN CLIMB OUT
OF HERE, LET ALONE ESCAPE.
YOU LEAVE THAT TO ME.
MAYBE IF YOU GO
WITH THAT QUAXTON FELLA
AND BE IN HIS SHOW,
YOU'D MAKE OUT.
NEVER.
I WOULDN'T SPIT ON
A DOO-DEEN LIKE THAT QUAXTON.
WELL, MAYBE SO.
DO AS YOU LIKE.
I'M WANTIN' TO FADE AWAY
AND CALL IT QUITS.
THAT'S ENOUGH
OF THAT KIND OF TALK.
WE'RE GETTIN' OUT OF HERE.
SUPPOSIN' WE DO ESCAPE.
WHAT GOOD'S IT GONNA DO US?
WE'RE THE LAST OF THE GNOMES,
YOU AND ME.
THIS IS THE --
IT'S THE END OF THE LINE.
GRANDPA, THERE'S A BEAUTIFUL
FOREST DOWN THE ROAD.
YOU'LL FEEL MORE YOURSELF
WHEN WE GET YOU BACK
WHERE YOU BELONG.
[ VEHICLE APPROACHES ]
QUICK -- THAT'S HIM!
I KEEP TELLIN' YA, BOY,
I'M TOO OLD!
[ KEY RATTLES IN LOCK ]
THERE -- THERE WE ARE, GENTS.
GNOME BURGERS --
HEY, YOU SNEAKY, LITTLE WEASEL!
COME BACK HERE!
KEEP GOIN', GRANDPA!
I'LL CATCH UP WITH YOU
LATER!
OH, NO, YOU WON'T!
ON, NO, YOU DON'T!
AW, NOW LOOK, LITTLE FELLA,
YOU AND ME HAVE GREAT THINGS
AHEAD OF US --
GREAT THINGS!
OH, YOU HAVE NO IDEA.
OH, I GOT IDEA ENOUGH.
OH, NOW,
DON'T BE LIKE THAT!
HA, HA,
WELL, WELL, WELL,
AREN'T YOU THE LIVELY,
LITTLE FELLOW, THOUGH, HUH?
WHICH IS MORE THAN CAN BE SAID
FOR YOUR OLD GRANDPA.
OH, BUT NEVER MIND HIM.
DON'T YOU SEE? WE DON'T
HAVE TO CUT HIM IN ON THIS.
IT'S JUST YOU AND ME
AND $1 MILLION --
ONE WHOLE COOL MILLION DOLLARS
WAITING FOR US
TO COME AND PICK IT UP.
UNH-UNH.
STAND BACK, QUAXTON.
I'M -- I'M WARNIN' YOU.
COME ONE STEP CLOSER,
AND I'LL SHOOT!
OH, COME ON, NOW,
LITTLE FELLOW.
I'M NOT TRYING
TO HURT YOU.
BESIDES, THE GUN
ISN'T EVEN LOADED.
[ GUN HAMMER CLICKS ]
SEE,
WHAT DID I TELL YOU, HUH?
NO, YOU SHOULD, UH --
SHOULD LEARN TO LISTEN TO ME
ONCE IN A WHILE.
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE THAT,
LITTLE FRIEND.
YOU JUST MIGHT HAVE HURT ME.
FACT IS,
YOU MIGHT HAVE KILLED ME!
ALL RIGHT, QUAXTON.
CARE TO TRY AGAIN?
OW!
UH...GOTCHA!
DON'T FIGHT IT!
AH!
[ LAUGHING ]
OH, BACK YOU COME!
OOH!
[ LAUGHING CONTINUES ]
Quaxton: I'M WARNING YOU,
NOW, DON'T MAKE ME MAD!
WHEN I GET MAD,
I GET DANGEROUS, AND I'LL WRING
YOUR NECK IF I HAVE TO!
NOW, REMEMBER, YOUNG FELLA,
I CAN MAKE AS MUCH MONEY
WITH A STUFFED GNOME,
SO FROM NOW ON,
I THINK YOU BETTER
PLAY IT MY WAY, HUH?
I MEAN IT!
THIS IS YOUR LAST CHANCE!
I'M THROUGH BEING NICE!
NOW, YOU HOLD STILL,
OR I'LL BREAK YOU IN PIECES!
JASPER,
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?!
YEAH, BUT GRANDPA'S GONE,
AND I'M WORRIED ABOUT HIM!
HE'S WANTIN' TO FADE AWAY!
YOU SKUNK!
- NO, NO, NO --
YOU LOW-DOWN,
UNMITIGATED SCOUNDREL!
JUST WATCH YOUR LANGUAGE!
YOU UNSCRUPULOUS DOO-DEEN!
I WASN'T TRYIN' TO HURT THEM.
I WAS ONLY TRYIN'
TO MAKE A LITTLE DEAL!
WAIT JUST A MINUTE!
HE'S MY GNOME!
YOU SAID YOU WANTED
NOTHING MORE TO DO WITH THEM!
WHERE'S KNOBBY?
THERE'S A FOREST DOWN THE ROAD.
I SAID I'D MEET HIM THERE.
MR. MULROONEY,
YOU'RE A BUSINESSMAN.
I HAVE A PROPOSITION
TO MAKE YOU ON A GOOD THING!
LISTEN,
YOU'RE MISSING A BET!
NOW, THERE'S A FORTUNE
IN IT FOR ALL OF US!
MULROONEY!
[ CRYING ]
HAVE YOU SEEN ANYTHING
OF AN OLD GAFFER
AND A COUPLE OF KIDS
IN A ROLLS-ROYCE?
ROLLS-ROYCE...
LIKE THAT ONE?
YES, LIKE THAT ONE.
HEY, THAT'S IT! WHAT ARE WE
WAITING FOR? AFTER HIM!
HEY!
[ TIRES SQUEAL ]
[ BELL DINGING ]
OH, NO!
OH! OH!
[ WHIMPERING ]
OHHHHH!
GRANDFATHER, THERE'S
SOMEBODY TAILING US.
ANYBODY WE KNOW?
IT'S MR. YARBY.
MR. YARBY?!
WELL, WELL, WELL.
KEEP OUT OF SIGHT,
JASPER.
ALL RIGHT, MR. MULROONEY.
BUT WHY, GRANDFATHER?
WHY NOT STOP
AND LET THEM SEE HIM?
THAT WOULD PROVE
YOU WEREN'T CRAZY.
NOT ON YOUR LIFE, HONEY.
IT'LL BE A COLD DAY
IN THE TROPICS
WHEN D.J. MULROONEY
DOES ANYTHING
JUST TO PROVE TO RALPH YARBY
THAT HE'S GOT ALL HIS MARBLES.
FASTER, MAN, FASTER!
YES, MR. YARBY.
THEY'RE GAINING ON US!
THEY WON'T FOR LONG.
LET'S SEE HOW WELL
THEY KEEP UP
WHEN THE GOING GETS ROUGH.
JASPER, I THOUGHT I TOLD YOU
TO KEEP OUT OF SIGHT.
I'M TRYIN' TO,
MR. MULROONEY!
OH!
LOOK WHERE YOU'RE GOING!
I CAN'T SEE THE ROAD
FOR THE TREES!
DON'T STOP, STUPID!
GET GOING, GET GOING!
GET THAT HOOD CLOSED!
WE CAN'T SEE WHERE WE'RE GOING!
I KNOW, MR. YARBY,
BUT HOW?!
GIVE 'ER THE GAS!
FULL SPEED AHEAD!
I SAID AHEAD!
PUT ON THE BRAKES!
MAYBE YOU'D CARE TO TRY.
THEY'RE WITH US AGAIN!
WELL, LET'S SEE
HOW THEY ARE ON CORNERING.
HOLD TIGHT, EVERYBODY!
WHEE! I TAKE IT
ALL BACK, GRANDFATHER!
THIS IS SOME CAR!
OH!
JUST SOME FENDERS --
NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.
TURN, TURN, TURN!
MR. YARBY,
WOULD YOU CARE TO DRIVE?!
I --
AAH!
WHAT DID WE LOSE NOW?!
ONLY THE REAR WHEELS!
LOOK OUT, RALPH!
THEY DON'T MAKE 'EM
LIKE THEY USED TO, HUH, RALPH?
GRANDPA!
GRANDPA!
D.J.: KNOBBY!
Children: KNOBBY!
YOO-HOO, KNOBBY!
KNOBBY!
WHERE ARE YOU?!
GRANDPA!
GRANDPA, SHOW YOURSELF!
KNOBBY!

YOU DON'T THINK
HE'S FADED AWAY?
OH, NO -- KNOBBY!

- WHERE ARE YOU?!
SHH! I THINK
I HEAR SOMETHING.
YAHOO!
YIPPEE!
YAHOO!
YAHOO! YIPPEE!
GRANDPA,
WHAT'S GOTTEN INTO YOU?!
MULROONEY, YOU WERE RIGHT!
WE AIN'T THE ONLY GNOMES
IN THE WORLD!
YEE-HAY!
RUFUS?
- YES?
COME ON OUT AND MEET
MY DOO-DEEN FRIENDS!
ANY FRIEND OF KNOBBY'S
IS A FRIEND OF OURS!
HELLO, DOO-DEEN.
WELCOME.
WELL, THANK YOU.
IT'S NICE TO BE HERE.
HI.
AND IS THIS THE YOUNG ONE
WHO WOULD LIKE TO MEET
SOME OTHER GNOMES?
YES, SIR, I SURE WOULD.
GOOD.
WELL, ALL RIGHT.
MY BOY...
IF YOU WERE AFRAID YOU
WERE THE LAST OF THE GNOMES,
TAKE HEART.
THERE'S LOTS OF US,
AND HERE'S THE PROOF.
YOU NEEDN'T EVER BE
LONESOME AGAIN.
SOMETHIN' THE MATTER
WITH YOU, BOY?
AIN'T YOU GLAD
TO FIND MORE GNOMES?
WELL, YEAH, GRANDPA,
ONLY, UH, UH...
WELL, W-WHAT ABOUT
THE, UH, UH...
WELL, YOU KNOW
WHAT I MEAN!
ALL RIGHT, OUT WITH IT!
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?!
KNOBBY...
I THINK THE BOY'S TRYIN' TO SAY,
"ARE THERE ANY GIRL GNOMES?"
WELL, OF COURSE!
HOW STUPID OF ME!
RUFUS HERE HAS MORE GIRL GNOMES
THAN HE KNOWS WHAT TO DO WITH!
RIGHT, RUFUS?
OH, AND YOU KNOW I HAVE!
MY GOODNESS,
HAVE I GOT GIRLS?!
I GOT BIG GIRLS,
AND I REALLY MEAN BIG ONES,
AND LITTLE GIRLS
IF YOU WANT A LITTLE ONE.
I GOT MEDIUM-SIZE ONES.
HAVE I GOT GIRLS?!
WHY, I'VE GOT SOME --
I'LL SHOW YOU.
GIRLS?!
GIRLS?!
COME ON OUT, GIRLS!

[ SCREAMING AND GIGGLING ]

NOW, DON'T LOSE
YOUR HEADS, GIRLS!
BACK THERE, BACK THERE!
GO LINE UP. LINE UP, NOW.
GIRLS ARE SO SILLY!
DON'T YOU THINK SO?
NO.
WHICH ONE DO YOU LIKE,
GRANDFATHER?
WELL, NOW, IT'S
KIND OF HARD TO SAY.
I LIKE 'EM ALL.
WELL, DON'T STAND THERE
LIKE A STUMP, BOY!
YOU COME LOOKIN' FOR A BRIDE!
GET GOIN'!
GO ON, GO ON!
THIS IS NO TIME
TO BE BASHFUL!

GO AHEAD!
THAT ONE'S POPPY.
AND THE NEXT --
THAT'S PETUNIA --
NAMED AFTER A FLOWER,
YOU KNOW.
THAT'S HEATHER...
AND THAT ONE IS MORNING GLORY.
THAT'S A LOVELY NAME.
OH, JASPER,
THAT'S SNAPDRAGON.
BY THE WAY, SHE'S
MY NIECE, JASPER.
SHE'S THE ONE
I THINK HE'LL LIKE.
[ GIGGLES ]
SHE'S THE ONE
I THINK YOU'LL LIKE.
OH, THAT NEXT ONE --
THAT'S BUTTERCUP.
THAT'S DAISY -- DAISY --
THAT'S A PRETTY NAME.
YEAH.
HE MUST BE GETTING OLD --
AND THISTLE DOWN...
AND THAT'S PRIMROSE.
AND THERE'S DEWDROP --

SO PRETTY, THAT --
AZALEA...
AND THAT'S PEARBLOSSOM.

THAT'S TWO WORDS
MADE INTO ONE, YOU KNOW.
AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST,
POOR VIOLET, THERE.
A BIT BASHFUL,
I'M AFRAID.
UH...
H-HI.
WELL, COME ON, BOY!
IF THAT'S THE ONE,
GO AHEAD AND TAKE HER!
Rufus: OH, NO, YOU DON'T!
AND WHY NOT?
HE PICKED THE ONE HE WANTS!
"THE ONE HE WANTS!"
OH, MY GOODNESS! IT'S NOT
THE MALE THAT PICKS HIS MATE.
IT'S THE SHE-MALE
THAT PICKS THE DATE.
IT'LL ALL END OUT ALL RIGHT.
IT'S THE OLDEST LAW IN NATURE.
I NEVER HEARED
SUCH NONSENSE!
WHAT ARE YOU TALKIN' ABOUT?
YOU KNOW THAT WHENEVER
WE HAVE A BUMPER CROP
OF FEMALES,
WE LIKE TO GIVE
EVERY MAIDEN A CHANCE.
WELL, YOU MEAN HE'S STUCK
WITH WHOEVER PICKS HIM?
NOW YOU'RE GETTING IT.
PREPARE THE ELIGIBLE GNOME!

Freddy, go and find a cab.
Do you want me to catch pneumonia?
Don't just stand there, Freddy.
Go and find a cab.
All right, I'll get one.
Look where you're goin', dear.
Look where you're goin'!
I'm so sorry.
Two bunches o' violets trod in the mud.
A full day's wages.
-Freddy, go and find a cab.
-Yes, Mother.
He's your son, is he?
If you'd done your duty as a mother should...
...you wouldn't let 'im spoil a poor girl's flow'rs and run away without payin'.
Go about your business, my girl.
And you wouldn't go off without payin', either.
Two bunches o' violets trod in the mud.
Sir, is there any sign of it stopping?
I'm afraid not. It's worse than before.
If it's worse, it's a sign it's nearly over.
Cheer up, Capt'n, buy a flow'r off a poor girl.
I'm sorry, I haven't any change.
I can change 'alf a crown.
Take this for tuppence.
I told you, I'm awfully sorry.
Wait a minute.
Oh, yes. Here's three ha' pence, if that's any use to you.
Thank you, sir.
You be careful.
Better give 'im a flower for it.
There's a bloke here behind that pillar...
...takin' down every blessed word you're sayin'.
I ain't done nothin' wrong by speakin' to the gentleman.
I've a right to sell flow'rs if I keep off the curb.
I'm a respectable girl, so help me.
I never spoke to him except to ask him to buy a flow'r off me.
-What's the bloomin' noise?
-A tec's takin' her down.
I'm makin' an honest livin'.
Who's doing all that shouting?
Sir, don't let 'im charge me.
You dunno what it means to me.
They'll take away me character and drive me on the streets...
...for speakin' to gentlemen.
There, there. Who's hurting you, you silly girl? What'd you take me for?
On my Bible oath, I never spoke a word.
Shut up! Do I look like a policeman?
Why'd ya take down me words?
'Ow do I know you took me down right?
You just show me what you wrote ab'ut me.
That ain't proper writin'. I can't read it.
I can.
"l say, Capt'n, now buy a flow'r off a poor girl."
Oh, it's cause I called him "Capt'n."
I meant no 'arm. Sir, don't let him lay a charge against me for a word like that.
I'll make no charge.
Really, sir, if you are a detective...
...you needn't protect me against molestation from young women...
...until I ask you.
Anyone could tell the girl meant no harm.
He ain't no tec. He's a gentleman.
Look at his boots.
How are all your people down at Selsey?
Who told you my people come from Selsey?
Never mind, they do.
How do you come to be up so far east?
You were born in Lisson Grove.
What 'arm is there in my leavin' Lisson Grove?
It weren't fit for pigs to live.
I had to pay four and six a week.
Live where you like but stop that noise!
Come, come, he can't touch you.
You've a right to live where you please.
I'm a good girl, I am.
-Where do I come from?
-Hawkestone.
Who said I didn't?
Blimey, you know everything, you do.
You, sir, do you think you could find me a taxi?
Madam, it's stopped raining.
You can get a motorbus to Hampton Court..
Isn't that where you live?
What impertinence!
Tell 'im where he comes from, if you wanta go fortune-telling.
Cheltenham, Harrow...
...Cambridge and...
...India?
Quite right.
He ain't a tec, he's a bloomin' busybody.
Do you do this sort of thing for a living at a music hall?
I have thought of it.
Perhaps I will one day.
He's no gentleman, he ain't, to interfere with a poor girl!
How do you do it, may I ask?
Simple phonetics. The science of speech.
That's my profession. Also my hobby.
Anyone can spot an lrishman or a Yorkshireman by his brogue...
...but I can place a man within six miles.
I can place 'im within two miles in London.
Sometimes within two streets.
Ought to be ashamed of 'imself, unmanly coward.
-Is there a living in that?
-Oh, yes.
Let him mind his own business and leave a poor girl alone.
Cease this detestable boohooing instantly...
...or else seek the shelter of some other place of worship!
I have a right to be here if I like, same as you!
A woman who utters such disgusting, depressing noises...
...has no right to be anywhere, no right to live.
Remember, you're a human with a soul...
...and the divine gift of articulate speech.
Your native language is the language of Shakespeare and...
...Milton and the Bible. Don't sit there crooning like a bilious pigeon.
"Look at her, a prisoner of the gutters"
"Condemned by every syllable she utters"
"By right she should be taken out and hung"
"For the cold-blooded murder of the English tongue"
Heavens, what a sound!
"This is what the British population"
"Calls an elementary education"
Come, sir, I think you've picked a poor example.
Did l?
"Hear them down in Soho Square
Dropping H's everywhere"
"Speaking English any way they like"
"Hey, you, sir, did you go to school?"
"What ya tike me for, a fool?"
"No one taught him 'take' instead of 'tike"
"Hear a Yorkshireman, or worse
Hear a Cornishman converse"
"l'd rather hear a choir singing flat"
"Chickens cackling in a barn
Just like this one"
"Garn!"
"l ask you, sir, what sort of word is that?"
"lt's 'aoow' and 'garn' that keep her in her place"
"Not her wretched clothes and dirty face"
"Why can't the English teach their children how to speak?"
"This verbal class distinction by now should be antique"
"If you spoke as she does, sir, instead of the way you do"
"Why, you might be selling flowers, too"
I beg your pardon.

See this creature with her curbstone English...
...that'll keep her in the gutter till the end of her days?
In six months I could pass her off as a duchess at an Embassy Ball.
I could get her a job as a lady's maid or a shop assistant...
...which requires better English.
What's that you say?
Yes, you squashed cabbage leaf!
You disgrace to the noble architecture of these columns!
You incarnate insult to the English language!
I could pass you off as the Queen of Sheba.
You don't believe that, Capt'n?
Anything's possible.
I, myself, am a student of Indian dialects.
Are you? Do you know Colonel Pickering, the author of Spoken Sanskrit?
I am Colonel Pickering. Who are you?
I'm Henry Higgins, author of Higgins' Universal Alphabet.
I came from India to meet you!
I was going to India to meet you!
-Where are you staying?
-At the Carleton.
No, you're not.
You're staying at 27A Wimpole Street.
You come with me.
We'll have a little jaw over supper.
Indian dialects have always fascinated me.
Buy a flower. I'm short for me lodgin'.
Liar!
You said you could change half a crown.
You ought to be stuffed with nails, you ought!
Here, take the whole bloomin' basket for a sixpence!
A reminder.
-How many are there actually?
-How many what?
Indian dialects?
No fewer than 147 distinct languages are recorded as vernacular in India.
Shouldn't we stand up, gentlemen?
We've got a bloomin' heiress in our midst.
Would you be lookin' for a good butler, Eliza?
Well, you won't do.
"lt's rather dull in town
I think I'll take me to Paris"
"The missus wants to open up the castle in Capri"
"Me doctor recommends a quiet summer by the sea"
"Wouldn't it be loverly?"
Where are ya bound for this year, Eliza?
Biarritz?
"All I want is a room somewhere"
"Far away from the cold night air"
"With one enormous chair"
"Oh, wouldn't it be loverly?"
"Lots of chocolate for me to eat"
"Lots of coal makin' lots of 'eat"
"Warm face, warm 'ands, warm feet"
"Oh, wouldn't it be loverly?"
"Oh, so loverly sittin'"
"Absobloominlutely still"

Come on, Alfie, let's go 'ome now.
This place is givin' me the willies.
Home? What do you want to go 'ome for?
It's nearly 5:00.
My daughter Eliza'll be along soon.
She ought to be good for 'alf a crown for a father that loves 'er.
That's a laugh.
You ain't been near 'er for months.
What's that got to do with it?
What's 'alf a crown after all I've give 'er?
When did you ever give 'er anythin'?
Anythin'? I give 'er everythin'.
I give 'er the greatest gift any human being can give to another:
Life!
I introduced 'er to this here planet, I did, with all its wonders and marvels.
The sun that shines, the moon that glows.
Hyde Park to walk through on a fine spring night.
The 'ole ruddy city o' London to roam around in sellin' 'er bloomin' flow'rs.
I give 'er all that.
Then I disappears and leaves 'er on 'er own to enjoy it.
If that ain't worth 'alf a crown now and again...
...l'll take my belt off and give 'er what for.
You got a good 'eart.
But you want a 'alf a crown out o' Eliza...
...you better have a good story.
Leave that to me, my boy.
-Good mornin', George.
-Not a brass farthin'.
Not a brass farthin'.
There she is.
Why, Liza, what a surprise.
Hop along, Charlie, you're too old for me
-Don't you know your daughter?
-You don't know what she looks like.
I know 'er, I know 'er.
Come on, I'll find 'er.
Eliza, what a surprise.
Not a brass farthin'.
Hey, you come 'ere, Eliza.
I ain't gonna take me 'ard-earned wages...
...and let you pass 'em on to a bloody pubkeeper.
You wouldn't send me 'ome to your stepmother...
...without a drop o' liquid protection, would ya?
Stepmother, indeed!
Well, I'm willin' to marry 'er.
It's me that suffers by it.
I'm a slave to that woman, Eliza.
Just because I ain't 'er lawful 'usband.
Slip your ol' dad just 'alf a crown to go 'ome on.
Well, I had a bit o' luck meself last night.
But don't keep comin' around countin' on 'alf crowns from me!
Thank you, Eliza. You're a noble daughter.
"Beer, beer, glorious beer
"Fill yourself right up"
See this creature with her curbstone English...
...that will keep her in the gutter till the end of her days?
In six months, I could pass her off as a duchess at an Embassy Ball.
I could get her a job as a lady's maid or a shop assistant...

How many vowel sounds did you hear altogether?
I believe I counted 24.
Wrong by 100. To be exact you heard 130.
Listen to them one at a time.
Must l? I'm really quite done up for one morning.
Your name, please?
Your name, miss?
My name is of no concern to you whatsoever.
One moment, please.
London is gettin' so dirty these days.
I'm Mrs. Pearce, the housekeeper.
Can I help you?
Good morning, missus.
I'd like to see the professor, please.
Could you tell me what it's about?
It's business of a personal nature.
One moment, please.
-Mr. Higgins?
-What is it, Mrs. Pearce?
There's a young woman who wants to see you, sir.
A young woman?
What does she want?
She's quite a common girl, sir.
Very common indeed.
I should've sent her away, only I thought...
...you wanted her to talk into your machine.
-Has she an interesting accent?
-Simply ghastly.
Good. Let's have her in.
Show her in, Mrs. Pearce.
This is rather a bit of luck.
I'll show you how I make records.
We'll set her talking, then I'll take her down first in Bell's Visible Speech...
...then in broad Romic.
Then we'll get her on the phonograph..."
...so you can turn her on when you want with the written transcript before you.
This is the young woman, sir.
Good mornin', my good man.
Might I 'ave a word with you?
Oh, no. This is the girl
I jotted down last night.
She's no use. I got the records I want of the Lisson Grove lingo.
I won't waste another cylinder on that.
Be off with you. I don't want you.
Don't be so saucy.
You ain't 'eard what I come for yet.
Did you tell 'im I come in a taxi?
Nonsense. Do you think a gentleman like Mr. Higgins cares...
...what you came in?
Oh, we are proud.
He ain't above givin' lessons, not 'im.
I 'eard 'im say so
I ain't come here to ask for any compliment...
...and if my money's not good enough,
I can go elsewhere.
Good enough for what?
Good enough for you.
Now you know, don't ya?
I'm come to 'ave lessons.
And to pay for 'em, too, make no mistake.
Well!
And what do you expect me to say?
Well, if you was a gentleman, you might ask me to sit down, I think.
Don't I tell you I'm bringin' you business?
Should we ask this baggage to sit down...
...or shall we just throw her out of the window?
I won't be called a baggage.
Not when I've offered to pay like any lady.
What do you want, my girl?
I want to be a lady in a flow'r shop...
...'stead of sellin' at the corner of Tottenham Court Road.
But they won't take me unless I can talk more genteel.
He said 'e could teach me.
Well, 'ere I am ready to pay 'im.
Not asking any favor and he treats me as if I was dirt.
I know what lessons cost as well as you do and I'm ready to pay.
How much?
Now you're talkin'.
I thought you'd come off it for a chance to get back...
...a bit of what you chucked at me last night.
You'd had a drop in, 'adn't you?
Sit down.
-If you're goin' t' make a compliment of it--
-Sit down!
Sit down, girl. Do as you're told.
What's your name?
Eliza Doolittle.
Won't you sit down, Miss Doolittle?
I don't mind if I do.
How much do you propose to pay me for these lessons?
Oh, I know what's right.
My lady friend gets French lessons for 18 pence an hour...
...from a real French gentleman.
You wouldn't have the face to ask me the same...
...for teachin' me my own language as you would for French
I won't give more than a shillin'.
Take it or leave it.
Do you know, Pickering, if you think of a shilling...
...not as a simple shilling, but as a percentage of this girl's income...
...it works out as fully equivalent of...
...60 or 70 pounds from a millionaire.
By George, it's enormous.
It's the biggest offer I ever had.
Sixty pounds? What are you talkin' about?
Where would I get 60 pounds
-I never offered you 60 pounds!
-Hold your tongue!
But I ain't got 60 pounds
Don't cry, silly girl. Sit down.
Nobody's going to touch your money.
Somebody'll touch you with a broomstick if you don't stop sniveling.
Sit down!
Anybody'd think you was my father!
If I decide to teach you,
I'll be worse than two fathers to you.
What's this for?
To wipe your eyes. To wipe any part of your face that feels moist.
Remember, that's your handkerchief and that's your sleeve.
Don't confuse one with the other, if you want to become a lady in a shop
It's no use to talk to her like that.
She doesn't understand you.
Give the 'andkerchief to me.
He give it to me, not to you!
Higgins, I'm interested.
What about your boast...
...you could pass her off as a duchess at the Embassy Ball?
I'll say you're the greatest teacher alive if you do that.
I'll bet you all the expenses of the experiment that you can't do it.
I'll even pay for the lessons
You're real good. Thank ye, Capt'n.
It's almost irresistible.
She's so deliciously low.
So horribly dirty.
I ain't dirty! I washed my face an' hands before I come, I did.
I'll take it. I'll make a duchess of this draggle-tailed guttersnipe.
We'll start today. This moment.
Take her away and clean her.
Sandpaper, if it won't come off.
Is there a fire in the kitchen?
Take her clothes off and burn them and order some new ones.
Just wrap her in brown paper till they come.
You're no gentleman, you're not, to talk o' such things.
I'm a good girl, I am.
And I know what the likes of you are, I do.
We want none of your slum prudery here, young woman.
You've got to learn to behave like a duchess.
Take her away, Mrs. Pearce.
If she gives you any trouble, wallop her.
I'll call the police, I will.
I've got no place to put her.
Well, put her in the dustbin.
Come, Higgins, be reasonable.
You must be reasonable,
Mr. Higgins, you must.
You can't walk over everybody like this.
I?
Walk over everybody?
My dear Mrs. Pearce, my dear Pickering,
I had no intention of walking over anybody.
I merely suggested we should be kind to this poor girl.
I didn't express myself clearly because I didn't wish to hurt her delicacy...
...or yours.
But, sir, you can't take a girl up like that...
...as if you were picking up a pebble on the beach.
Why not?
Why not? But you don't know anything about her.
What about her parents?
She may be married.
Garn!
There. As the girl very properly says, "garn! "
Who'd marry me?
By George, Eliza...
...the streets will be strewn with the bodies of men...
...shooting themselves for your sake before I'm done with you.
I'm goin'.
He's off his chump, he is.
I don't want no balmies teachin' me.
Mad? All right, Mrs. Pearce, don't order those new clothes
-Throw her out.
-Stop! I won't allow it.
Go home to your parents, girl.
I ain't got no parents.
She ain't got no parents. What's the fuss?
Nobody wants her. She's no use to anyone but me. Take her upstairs!
What's to become of her? ls she to be paid anything?
Do be sensible, sir.
What'd she do with money?
She'll have food and clothes.
She'll drink if you give her money.
You are a brute! It's a lie!
Nobody ever saw the sign o' liquor on me.
Sir, you're a gentleman.
Don't let 'im speak to me like that
Does it occur to you, Higgins, the girl has some feelings?
No, I don't think so.
No feelings we need worry about.
Well, have you, Eliza?
I got me feelings same as anyone else.
Mr. Higgins, I must know on what terms the girl is to be here.
What'll become of her when you've finished teaching?
You must look ahead a little, sir.
What'll become of her if we leave her in the gutter, Mrs. Pearce?
That's her own business, not yours, Mr. Higgins.
When I'm done, we'll throw her back.
Then it'll be her own business again.
That'll be all right, won't it?
You've no feelin' 'eart in ya!
You don't care for nothin' but yourself.
I've 'ad enough of this. I'm goin'!
You ought to be ashamed of yourself!
Have some chocolates, Eliza.
'Ow do I know what might be in 'em?
I've 'eard of girls bein' drugged by the likes o' you.
Pledge of good faith.
I'll take one half.
And you take the other.
You'll have boxes of them, barrels of them every day.
You'll live on them, eh?
I wouldn't 've ate it, only I'm too ladylike to take it out o' me mouth.
Think of it, Eliza.
Think of chocolates, and taxis...
...and gold and diamonds.
I don't want no gold and no diamonds.
I'm a good girl, I am.
Higgins, I really must interfere.
Mrs. Pearce is quite right.
If this girl will put herself in your hands for six months...
...for an experiment in teaching, she must understand thoroughly what she's doing.
You are to stay here for the next six months...
...learning how to speak beautifully like a lady in a florist shop.
If you're good and do what you're told, you'll sleep in a proper bedroom...
...have lots to eat, money to buy chocolates and take rides in taxis.
But if you are naughty and idle...
...you'll sleep in the kitchen amongst the black beetles...
...and be walloped by Mrs. Pearce with a broomstick.
At the end of six months, you shall be taken to Buckingham Palace...
...in a carriage, beautifully dressed.
If the king finds out that you are not a lady...
...the police will take you to the Tower of London where your head will be cut off...
...as a warning to other presumptuous flower girls.
But if you are not found out, you shall have a present of...
...seven and six to start life with as a lady in a shop.
If you refuse this offer...
...you will be the most ungrateful, wicked girl...
...and the angels will weep for you!
Are you satisfied, Pickering?
I don't understand what you're talking about.
Could I put it more plainly or fairly,
Mrs. Pearce?
Come with me.
That's right.
Bundle her off to the bathroom.
You're a great bully, you are!
I won't stay here if I don't like it.
I won't let nobody wallop me
Don't answer back, girl.
I've always been a good girl, I 'ave.
In six months...in three, if she has a good ear and a quick tongue...
...l'll take her anywhere and I'll pass her off as anything.
I'll make a queen of that barbarous wretch!
I've never had a bath in me life.
Not what you'd call a proper one.
You know you can't be a nice girl inside if you're dirty outside.
I'll have to put you in here.
This will be your bedroom.
I couldn't sleep in here, missus.
It's too good for the likes o' me.
I should be afraid to touch anythin'.
I ain't a duchess yet, you know.
What's this?
This where you wash clothes?
This is where we wash ourselves, Eliza.
And where I'm going to wash you.
You expect me to get into that and wet meself all over?
Not me!
I shall catch me death.
Come along now.
Come along.
Take your clothes off.
Here, come on. Help me take these--
Take your hands off me!
I'm a good girl, I am!
It ain't right! It ain't decent!
Get your hands off me!
I'm a good girl, I am!
Forgive the bluntness, but if I'm to be in this business...
...l shall feel responsible for the girl.
I hope it's clearly understood that no advantage is to be taken of her position.
What, that thing? Sacred, I assure you.
Come now, you know what I mean.
This is no trifling matter.
Are you a man of good character where women are concerned?
Have you ever met a man of good character where women are concerned?
Yes, very frequently.
I haven't. The moment I let a woman make friends with me...
...she becomes jealous, exacting...
...suspicious and a damned nuisance.
The moment that I make friends with a woman I become selfish and tyrannical.
So here I am, a confirmed old bachelor and likely to remain so.
Well, after all, Pickering....

Get out of 'ere. Jamie, you get out, too!
Come on, Doolittle. And remember, drinks is to be paid for or not drunk.
Thanks for your 'ospitality, George.
Send the bill to Buckingham Palace.
Well, Alfie, there's nothin' else to do.
I guess it's back to work.
Work! Don't you dare mention that word in my presence again.
Look at all these poor blighters down here.
I used to do that sort of thing once.
Just for exercise
It's not worth it. Takes up your whole day.
Don't worry, boys.
We'll get outta this somehow.
How do you think you'll do that?
How? Same as always.
Faith, hope and a little bit o' luck.

You'd make a good suffragette, Alfie.
Why, there's the lucky man now.
The Honorable Alfie Doolittle.
What are you doing in Eliza's house?
Her former residence!
You can buy your own drinks now,
Alfie Doolittle.
Fallen into a tub of butter, you have.
What are you talkin' about?
Your daughter, Eliza.
You're a lucky man, Alfie Doolittle.
What about Eliza?
He don't know.
Her own father an' he don't know.
Moved in with a swell, Eliza has.
Left here in a taxi all by herself, smart as paint.
An' ain't been home for three days.
Go on.
And this mornin' I gets a message from 'er.
She wants her things sent over...
...to 27A Wimpole Street...
...care of Professor Higgins.
An' what things does she want?
Her birdcage and her Chinese fan.
But she says:
"Never mind about sending any clothes."
I knew she had a career in front of 'er.
We're in for a booze-up.
The sun is shining on Alfred P. Doolittle.

The mail, sir.
Pay the bills and say no to the invitations.
You simply cannot go on working the girl this way.
Making her say her alphabet over and over...
...from sunup to sundown, even during meals.
You'll exhaust yourself. When will it stop?
When she does it properly, of course.
Is that all, Mrs. Pearce?
There's another letter from the
American millionaire, Ezra D. Wallingford.
He still wants you for his Moral Reform League.
Throw it away.
It's the third letter he's written you.
You should at least answer it.
All right, leave it on the desk, Mrs. Pearce.
I'll try and get to it.
If you please, sir. There's a dustman downstairs, Alfred P. Doolittle...
...who wants to see you.
He says you have his daughter here.
I say!
Well, send the blackguard up.
He may not be a blackguard, Higgins.
Nonsense. Of course he's a blackguard, Pickering.
I'm afraid we'll have some trouble with him.
No, I think not. Any trouble to be had, he'll have it with me. Not I with him.
Doolittle, sir.
-Professor Higgins?
-Here!
Where?
Good morning, Governor.
I come about a very serious matter,
Governor.
Brought up in Houndslow.
Mother Welsh, I should think.
What is it you want, Doolittle?
I want my daughter, that's what I want.
See?
Of course you do.
You're her father, aren't you?
I'm glad to see you have a spark of family feeling left.
She's in there. Yes, take her away at once.
What?
Take her away. Do you think I am going to keep your daughter for you?
Now, is this reasonable, Governor?
Is it fairity to take advantage of a man like that?
The girl belongs to me. You got 'er.
Where do I come in?
How dare you come here and attempt to blackmail me!
You sent her here on purpose!
Don't take a man up like that, Governor.
The police shall take you up.
This is a plan...
...a plot to extort money by threats.
I shall telephone the police.
Have I asked you for a brass farthin'?
Domnu say '.
I leave it to this gentleman 'ere.
Have I said a word about money?
Well, what else did you come for?
What would a bloke come for?
Be 'uman, Governor.
Alfred, you sent her here on purpose.
So help me, Governor, I never did.
How did you know she was here?
I'd tell you, Governor, if you'd let me get a word in.
I'm willing to tell ya.
I'm wanting to tell ya.
I'm waiting to tell ya!
You know, Pickering, this chap's got a certain natural gift of rhetoric..
Observe the rhythm of his native woodnotes wild.
"l'm willing to tell you. I'm wanting to tell you. I'm waiting to tell you."
That's the Welsh strain in 'im.
How did you know Eliza was here if you didn't send 'er?
Well, she sent back for her luggage and I got to 'ear about it.
She said she didn't want no clothes.
What was I to think from that, Governor?
I ask you, as a parent, what was I to think?
So you came here to rescue her from worse than death, eh?
-Yes, sir, Governor. That's right.
-Yes.
Mrs. Pearce!
Eliza's father has come to take her away.
Give her to him, will you?
Now wait a minute, Governor.
Wait a minute.
You and me is men o' the world, ain't we?
Men of the world, are we?
Perhaps you'd better go, Mrs. Pearce.
I think so indeed, sir!
Here, Governor.
I've took a sort of a fancy to you and...
...if you want the girl, I ain't so set on 'avin' her home again...
...but what I might be open to is an arrangement.
All I ask is my rights as a father.
You're the last man alive to expect me to let her go for nothing.
I can see you're a straight sort, Governor.
So...
...what's a five pound note to you?
An' what's Eliza to me?
I think you should know, Doolittle...
...that Mr. Higgins' intentions are entirely honorable.
Of course they are, Governor.
If I thought they wasn't, I'd ask 50.
You mean, you'd sell your daughter for 50 pounds?
Have you no morals, man?
No, I can't afford 'em, Governor. Neither could you if you was as poor as me.
Not that I mean any 'arm, but...
...if Eliza is gonna have a bit out o' this, why not me, too? Why not?
Look at it my way. What am l?
I ask ya, what am l? I'm one o' the undeserving poor, that's what I am.
Think what that means to a man.
It means he's up against middle-class morality for all the time.
If there's anything goin' an' I ask for a bit of it, it's always the same story:
"You're undeservin', so you can't have it."
But my needs is as great as the most deservin' widows that ever got money...
...out of six different charities in one week for the death o' the same 'usband.
I don't need less than a deservin' man,
I need more.
I don't eat less 'earty than he does and I drink...
...a lot more.
I'm playin' straight with you.
I ain't pretendin' to be deservin'.
No, I'm undeservin'...
...and I mean to go on bein' undeservin'.
I like it an' that's the truth
But will you take advantage of a man's nature...
...do him out of the price of his own daughter, what he's brought up..
...fed and clothed by the sweat of his brow...
...till she's growed big enough to be interestin' to you two gentlemen?
Is five pounds unreasonable,
I put it to you?
And I leave it to you.
You know, Pickering, if we took this man in hand for three months...
...he could choose between a seat in the Cabinet and a popular pulpit in Wales
-We'd better give 'im a fiver.
-He'll make bad use of it, I'm afraid.
Not me, Governor, so 'elp me I won't.
Just one good spree for meself an' the missus...
...givin' pleasure to ourselves and employment to others.
An' satisfaction to you to know it ain't been throwed away.
You couldn't spend it better.
This is irresistible. Let's give 'im ten.
The missus wouldn't have the 'eart to spend ten.
Ten pounds is a lot o' money.
Makes a man feel prudent-like, and then goodbye to 'appiness.
No, you just give me what I ask, Governor.
Not a penny less, not a penny more.
I rather draw the line at encouraging this sort of immorality.
Why don't you marry that missus of yours?
After all, marriage isn't so frightening.
You married Eliza's mother.
Who told you that, Governor?
Well, nobody told me.
I concluded, naturally....
If we listen to this man for another minute we'll have no convictions left.
-Five pounds, I think you said.
-Thank you, Governor.
Are you sure you won't have ten?
No. No, perhaps another time.
I beg your pardon, miss.
I won't say those ruddy vowels one more time.
Blimey, it's Eliza.
I never thought she'd clean up so good-looking.
She does me credit, don't she?
What are you doin' here?
Now, you hold your tongue and don't you give these gentlemen none o' your lip.
If you have any trouble with 'er, give 'er a few licks o' the strap.
That's the way to improve 'er mind.
Well, good morning, gentlemen.
Cheerio, Eliza.
There's a man for you.
A philosophical genius of the first water
Write to Mr. Ezra Wallingford and tell him...
...if he wants a lecturer, to get in touch with Mr. Doolittle...
...a common dustman, one of the most original moralists in England.
What did he come for?
Say your vowels.
I know me vowels.
I knew 'em before I come.
If you know them, say them.
-Ahyee, e, iyee, ow, you.
-A, E, I, O, U.
That's what I said. Ahyee, e, iyee, ow, you.
That's what I've said for three days an' I won't no more.
I know it's difficult, Miss Doolittle, but try to understand.
There's no use explaining.
As a military man you should know that.
Drilling is what she needs.
Leave her alone or she'll turn to you for sympathy.
Very well, if you insist, but have a little patience with her.
Of course.
Say "A".
You ain't got no 'eart, you ain't.
I promise you, you'll say your vowels correctly before this day is out...
...or there'll be no lunch, no dinner, and no chocolates.
"Just you wait, 'Enry 'lggins
Just you wait"
"You'll be sorry
But your tears will be too late"
"You'll be broke and I'll have money
Will I help you? Don't be funny!"
"Just you wait, 'Enry 'lggins
Just you wait"
"Just you wait, 'Enry 'lggins
Till you're sick"
"And you screams
To fetch a doctor double-quick"
"l'll be off a second later
And go straight to the theater"
"Ho, ho, ho, 'Enry 'lggins
Just you wait!"
"Just you wait
Until we're swimmin' in the sea"
"And you get the cramp a little ways from me"
"When you yell you're gonna drown
I'll get dressed and go to town"
"Just you wait!"
"One day I'll be famous
I'll be proper and prim"
"Go to St. James so often
I will call it St. Jim"
"One evening the king will say"
"Oh, Liza, old thing"
"l want all of England your praises to sing"
"Next week on the 20th of May"
"l proclaim Liza Doolittle Day"
"All the people will celebrate the glory of you"
"And whatever you wish and want
I gladly will do"
"Thanks a lot, King,' says I in a manner well-bred"
"But all I want is 'Enry 'lggins' 'ead'"
"Done!"
"Says the king with a stroke"
"Guard, run and bring in the bloke'"
"Then they'll march you, 'Enry 'lggins, to the wall"
"And the king will tell me"
"Liza, sound the call"
"As they raise their rifles higher"
"l'll shout: 'Ready, aim, fire!"
"Ho, ho, ho, 'Enry 'lggins, down you go"
"Just you wait!"
-All right, Eliza, say it again.
-"The rine in Spine stais minely in the pline."
"The rain in Spain stays mainly in the plain."
Didn't I saiy that?
No, Eliza, you didn't "saiy" that.
You didn't even "say" that.
Every night before you go to bed, where you used to say your prayers...
...l want you to say:
"The rain in Spain stays mainly in the plain."
Fifty times.
You'll get much further with the Lord if you learn not to offend His ears.
Now for your "H's."
Pickering, this is going to be ghastly.
Control yourself, Higgins.
Give the girl a chance.
I suppose you can't expect her to get it right the first time.
Come here, Eliza, and watch closely.
Now, you see that flame?
Every time you pronounce the letter "H" correctly the flame will waver...
...and every time you drop your "H" the flame will remain stationary.
That's how to know you've done it correctly.
In time, your ear will hear the difference.
You'll see it better in the mirror.
Now listen carefully.
"In Hartford, Hereford and Hampshire...
"...hurricanes hardly ever happen."
Now you repeat that after me.
"In Hartford, Hereford and Hampshire, hurricanes hardly ever happen."
"In 'artford, 'ereford and 'ampshire
'urricanes 'ardly hever 'appen."
Oh, no, no!
Have you no ear at all?
-Should I do it over?
-No, please.
Start from the very beginning.
Just do this.
Go on, go on..
Does the same thing hold true in India?
Have they the peculiar habit of not only dropping a letter...
...but using it where it doesn't belong, like "hever" instead of "ever"?
The girl, Higgins!
Go on. Go on.
"Oh, poor Professor Higgins"
"Night and day he slaves away"
"Oh, poor Professor Higgins"
"All day long on his feet"
"Up and down until he's numb"
"Doesn't rest, doesn't eat"
"Doesn't touch a crumb"
Again, Eliza.
"How kind of you to let me come."
No. "Kind of you."
Kind of you.
"How kind of you to let me come."
No. "Kind of you."
"Kind of you". lt's like ''cup of tea.''
Cup of tea. Say, "cup of tea."
Cuppatea.
No. "A cup of tea."
It's awfully good cake.
I wonder where Mrs. Pearce gets it.
First rate. And those strawberry tarts are delicious. Did you try the pline cake?
Try it again.
-Did you try the--
-Pickering!
Again, Eliza.
Cuppatea.
Oh, no.
Can't you hear the difference?
Look, put your tongue forward until it squeezes on the top of your lower teeth.
And then say "cup."
Then say "of."
Then say "cup, cup, cup, cup, of, of, of, of."
By Jove, Higgins, that was a glorious tea.
You finish the last strawberry tart.
I couldn't eat another thing.
-I couldn't touch it.
-Shame to waste it.
Oh, it won't be wasted. I know somebody who's immensely fond of strawberry tarts.
"Poor Professor Higgins"
"On he plods against all odds"
"Poor Professor Higgins"
"Nine p.m., ten p.m."
"On through midnight every night"
"One a.m., two a.m., three..."
Four.
Five.
Six marbles.
I want you to read this and I want you to enunciate...
...every word just as if the marbles were not in your mouth.
"With blackest moss, the flower pots...
"...were thickly crusted, one and all."
Each word, clear as a bell.
"With blackest moss the flower pots."
I can't!
I say, Higgins, are those pebbles really necessary?
If they were necessary for Demosthenes they are necessary for Eliza Doolittle.
Go on, Eliza.
"With the blackest moss the flower pots were thickly crusted one and--"
I can't understand a word, not a word.
Perhaps the poem is a little too difficult for the girl
Why don't you try something simpler, like The Owl and the Pussycat?
Yes, that's a charming one.
Pickering, I can't hear a word the girl is saying
What's the matter?
I swallowed one.
It doesn't matter. I've got plenty more.
Open your mouth. One, two....
"Quit, Professor Higgins"
"Hear our plea, or payday we will quit"
"Ay' not 'l', 'O' not 'ow'"
"Pounding, pounding in our brain"
"Ay' not 'l', 'O' not 'ow'"
"Don't say 'rine' say 'rain'"
"The rain in Spain...
...stays mainly in the plain."
I can't!
I'm so tired!
For God's sake, Higgins, it must be 3:00 in the morning.
Do be reasonable.
I am always reasonable.
Eliza, if I can go on with a blistering headache, you can.
I got a 'eadache, too.
I know your head aches.
I know you're tired.
I know your nerves are as raw as meat in a butcher's window.
But think what you're trying to accomplish.
Just think what you're dealing with.
The majesty and grandeur of the English language...
It's the greatest possession we have.
The noblest thoughts that ever flowed through the hearts of men...
...are contained in its extraordinary, imaginative...
...and musical mixtures of sounds.
And that's what you've set yourself out to conquer, Eliza.
And conquer it you will.
Now try it again.
"The rain in Spain...
...stays mainly in the plain."
What was that?
"The rain in Spain ...
...stays mainly in the plain."
Again.
I think she's got it.
"By George, she's got it
By George, she's got it"
"Now once again
Where does it rain?"
"On the plain, on the plain"
"And where's that soggy plain?"
"In Spain, in Spain"
"In Hartford, Hereford and Hampshire"
"Hurricanes hardly happen"
"How kind of you to let me come"
"Now once again
Where does it rain?"
"On the plain, on the plain"
"And where's that blasted plain?"
"In Spain, in Spain"
We're making fine progress, Pickering.
I think the time has come to try her out.
Are you feeling all right, Mr. Higgins?
Yes, I'm feeling fine. How are you?
-Very well, thank you.
-Good.
Let's test her in public and see how she fares.
Mr. Higgins, I was awakened by a dreadful pounding
Do you know what it might have been?
I didn't hear any pounding.
Did you, Pickering?
If this goes on, you'd better see a doctor.
-I know. We'll take her to the races.
-The races?
My mother's box at Ascot.
-You'll consult your mother first, of course.
-Yes, of course.
No, I think we'd better surprise her.
Now let's go to bed.
First thing in the morning, we'll go and buy her a dress.
Now get on with your work, Eliza.
But, Mr. Higgins, it's early in the morning.
What better time to work than early in the morning?
Where does one buy a lady's gown?
Whitely's, of course.
How do you know that?
Common knowledge.
Let's not buy her anything too flowery.
I despise those gowns with weeds here and weeds there.
We'll buy something simple and modest...
...and elegant. That's what's called for.
Perhaps with a bow.
Yes. That's just right.
You've all been working too hard.
I think the strain is beginning to show.
Eliza, I don't care what Mr. Higgins says.
You must put down your books and go to bed.
"Bed! Bed! I couldn't go to bed"
"My head's too light to try to set it down"
"Sleep! Sleep! I couldn't sleep tonight"
"Not for all the jewels in the crown!"
"l could have danced all night"
"And still have begged for more"
"l could have spread my wings"
"And done a thousand things l've never done before"
"I'll never know what made it so exciting"
"Why all at once my heart took flight"
"l only know when he"
"Began to dance with me"
"l could have danced, danced, danced..."
"...all night!"
It's after three now.
Don't you agree now?
She ought to be in bed!
"l could have danced all night"
"And still have begged for more"
"l could have spread my wings"
"And done a thousand things l've never done before"
"I'll never know what made it so exciting"
"Why all at once my heart took flight"
"l only know when he"
"Began to dance with me"
"l could have danced, danced, danced..."
"...all night!"
It's all been grand, dear.
But now it's time to sleep!
"l could have danced all night"
"And still have begged for more"
"l could have spread my wings"
"And done a thousand things l've never done before"
"I'll never know what made it so exciting"
"Why all at once my heart took flight"
"l only know when he"
"Began to dance with me"
"l could have danced, danced, danced..."
"...all night!"
"Every duke and earl and peer is here"
"Everyone who should be here is here"
"What a smashing, positively dashing"
"Spectacle, the Ascot opening day"
"At the gate are all the horses"
"Waiting for the cue to fly away"
"What a gripping, absolutely ripping"
"Moment at the Ascot opening day"
"Pulses rushing"
"Faces flushing"
"Heartbeats speed up"
"l have never been so keyed up!"
"Any second now"
"They'll begin to run"
"Hark! A bell is ringing"
"They are springing forward. Look!"
"lt has begun"
"What a frenzied moment that was"
"Didn't they maintain an exhausting pace?"
"lt was a thrilling, absolutely chilling"
"Running of the Ascot opening race!"
Mother!
Henry! What a disagreeable surprise.
Hello, Mother.
How nice you look.
What are you doing here? You promised never to come to Ascot. Go home.
I can't. I'm here on business.
You must. I'm quite serious.
You'll offend all my friends.
The moment they meet you
I never see them again.
Besides, you aren't dressed for Ascot.
I changed my shirt.
Mother, I've got a job for you.
A phonetics job. I've picked up a girl.
Not a love affair. She's a flower girl.
I'm taking her to the annual Embassy Ball but I wanted to try her out first.
-I beg your pardon?
-Well, you know the Embassy Ball.
So I invited her to your box today, do you understand?
Common flower girl?
I taught her how to speak properly.
She has strict instructions as to her behavior.
She's to keep to two subjects: the weather and everybody's health.
"Fine day! " and "How do you do?"
Not let herself go on.
Help her along. You'll be quite safe.
Safe? To talk about one's health in the middle of a race?
She's got to talk about something.
Where is the girl now?
She's being pinned. Some of the clothes we bought her didn't fit.
I told Pickering we should have taken her with us.
-Mrs. Eynsford-Hill.
-Good afternoon, Mrs. Higgins.
You know my son, Henry.
How do you do?
-I've seen you somewhere before.
-I don't know.
It doesn't matter. You better sit down.
Where the devil can they be?
Colonel Pickering, you're just in time for tea.
Thank you, Mrs. Higgins.
May I introduce Miss Eliza Doolittle?
My dear Miss Doolittle.
How kind of you to let me come.
Delighted, my dear.
-Lady Boxington.
-How do you do?
-Lord Boxington.
-How do you do?
-Mrs. Eynsford-Hill, Miss Doolittle.
-How do you do?
How do you do?
And Freddy Eynsford-Hill.
How do you do?
How do you do?
Miss Doolittle.
Good afternoon, Professor Higgins.
The first race was very exciting,
Miss Doolittle.
I'm so sorry that you missed it.
Will it rain, do you think?
"The rain in Spain stays mainly in the plain."
"But in Hartford, Hereford and Hampshire, hurricanes hardly ever happen."
How awfully funny.
What is wrong with that, young man?
I bet I got it right.
Smashing.
Has it suddenly turned chilly?
I do hope we won't have any unseasonable cold spells.
They bring on so much influenza.
And the whole of our family is susceptible to it.
My aunt died of influenza, so they said.
But it's my belief they done the old woman in.
Done her in?
Yes, Lord love you.
Why should she die of influenza...
...when she'd come through diphtheria right enough the year before.
Fairly blue with it she was.
They all thought she was dead.
But my father, he kept ladling gin down her throat.
Then she come to so sudden she bit the bowl off the spoon
Dear me!
Now what call would a woman with that strength in her...
...have to die of influenza?
And what become of her new straw hat that should have come to me?
Somebody pinched it.
And what I say is:
Them 'as pinched it, done her in.
Done her in? "Done her in," did you say?
Whatever does it mean?
That's the new small talk.
"To do somebody in" means to kill them.
But you surely don't believe your aunt was killed?
Do I not?
Them she lived with would have killed her for a hatpin, let alone a hat.
But it can't have been right for your father...
...to pour spirits down her throat like that.
It might have killed her.
Not her. Gin was mother's milk to her.
Besides, he poured so much down his own throat he knew the good of it.
Do you mean that he drank?
Drank? My word. Something chronic.
Here, what are you sniggering at?
The new small talk.
You do it so awfully well.
Well, if I was doing it proper, what was you sniggering at?
Have I said anything I oughtn't?
Not at all, my dear.
Well, that's a mercy anyhow.
I don't know if there's time before the next race to place a bet...
...but come, my dear.
I have a bet on number seven.
I should be so happy if you would take it.
You'll enjoy the race ever so much more.
That's very kind of you.
His name is Dover.
Come along.
"There they are again"
"Lining up to run"
"Now they're holding steady"
"They are ready for it. Look!"
"lt has begun"
Come on. Come on, Dover.
Come on, Dover!
Move your bloomin' arse!
Oh, my dear.
You're not serious, Henry. You don't expect to take her to the Embassy Ball.
Don't you think she's ready for it?
Dear Henry, she's ready for a canal barge.
Her language may need a little refining, but--
Really, Henry, if you cannot see how impossible this whole project is...
...then you must be potty about her.
I advise you to give up and not put yourself...
...or this poor girl through any more.
It's the most fascinating venture
I've ever undertaken.
Pickering and I are at it from morning till night. It fills our whole lives.
Teaching Eliza, talking to Eliza, listening to Eliza, dressing Eliza.
You're a pretty pair of babies playing with your live doll.
Here's the car.
Good evening, sir.
-Is dinner ready? I'm famished.
-Immediately, sir.
Good evening, Professor Higgins
"When she mentioned how her aunt bit off the spoon"
"She completely done me in"
"And my heart went on a journey to the moon"
"When she told about her father and the gin"
"And I never saw a more enchanting farce"
"Than the moment when she shouted
'Move your bloomin'--'"
-Yes, sir?
-Is Miss Doolittle in?
Whom shall I say is calling?
Freddy Eynsford-Hill.
If she doesn't remember who I am...
...tell her I'm the chap who was "sniggering" at her.
Yes, sir.
And will you give her these?
Wouldn't you like to come in?
They're having dinner, but you may wait in the hall.
No, thank you. I want to drink in the street where she lives.
"l have often walked down this street before"
"But the pavement always stayed beneath my feet before"
"All at once am I several stories high"
"Knowing I'm on the street where you live"
"Are there lilac trees in the heart of town?"
"Can you hear a lark in any other part of town?"
"Does enchantment pour out of every door?"
"No, it's just on the street where you live"
"And, oh, the towering feeling"
"Just to know somehow you are near"
"The overpowering feeling"
"That any second you may suddenly appear"
"People stop and stare, they don't bother me"
"For there's nowhere else on earth that I would rather be"
"Let the time go by"
"l won't care if I"
"Can be here on the street where you live"
I'm terribly sorry, sir.
Miss Doolittle says she doesn't want to see anyone ever again.
But why? She was unbelievable.
So I've been told, sir.
Is there any further message?
Tell her that I'll wait.
But it might be days, sir, even weeks.
But don't you see? I'll be happier here.
"People stop and stare, they don't bother me"
"For there's nowhere else on earth that I would rather be"
"Let the time go by"
"l won't care if I"
"Can be here on the street where you live"
It really is, Higgins.
It's inhuman to continue.
Do you realize what you've got to teach this girl in six weeks?
You've got to teach her to walk, talk, address a duke, a lord...
...a bishop, an ambassador.
It's absolutely impossible.
Higgins, I'm trying to tell you that I want to call off the bet.
I know you're a stubborn man, but so am I.
This experiment is over.
And nothing short of an order from the king could force me to recant.
You understand, Higgins? It's over.
Higgins, if there's any mishap at the Embassy tonight...
...if Miss Doolittle suffers any embarrassment...
...it'll be on your head alone.
Eliza can do anything.
Suppose she's discovered?
Remember Ascot.
Suppose she makes another ghastly mistake?
There'll be no horses at the ball, Pickering.
Think of how agonizing it would be.
If anything happened tonight,
I don't know what I'd do.
You could always rejoin your regiment.
This is no time for flippancy, Higgins.
The way you've driven her the last six weeks...
...has exceeded all bounds of common decency.
For God's sake, stop pacing.
Can't you settle somewhere?
Have some port. It'll quieten your nerves.
I'm not nervous.
-Where is it?
-On the piano.
The car's here, sir.
Good. Tell Miss Doolittle.
Tell Miss Doolittle indeed.
I'll bet you that damned gown doesn't fit.
I warned you about these French designers.
We should've gone to an English shop.
They would've been on our side.
-Have a glass of port?
-No, thank you. re you so sure this girl will retain everything you've hammered into her?
Well, we shall see.
Suppose she doesn't?
I lose my bet.
There's one thing I can't stand about you, your confounded complacency.
At a moment like this, with so much at stake...
...it's utterly indecent that you don't need a glass of port.
And what about the girl? You act as though she doesn't matter at all.
Rubbish, Pickering. Of course she matters.
What do you think I've been doing all these months?
What could possibly matter more than to take a human being...
...and change her into a different human being by creating a new speech for her?
It's filling up the deepest gap that separates class from class...
...and soul from soul.
Oh, she matters immensely.
Miss Doolittle, you look beautiful.
Thank you, Colonel Pickering.
Don't you think so, Higgins?
Not bad. Not bad at all.
Maestro! Maestro!
Don't you remember me?
No. Who the devil are you?
I'm your pupil. Your first, your greatest, your best pupil.
I'm Zoltan Karpathy, that marvelous boy.
I made your name famous throughout Europe.
You teach me phonetics.
You can't forget me.
Why don't you have your hair cut?
I don't have your imposing appearance, your figure, your brow.
If I had my hair cut, nobody would notice me.
Where did you get these old coins?
These are decorations for languages.
The Queen of Transylvania is here.
I'm indispensable to her at these official international parties.
I speak 32 languages.
I know everyone in Europe.
No imposter can escape my detection.
Professor Karpathy.
The Greek ambassador.
Greek, my foot!
He pretends not to know English, but he can't deceive me.
He's the son of a Yorkshire watchmaker
He speaks English so villainously that he cannot utter a word...
...without betraying his origin.
I help him pretend, but make him pay through the nose. I make them all pay.
Excuse me, sir, you are wanted upstairs.
Her Excellency asked for you.
Viscount and Viscountess Saxon.
Baron and Baroness of Yorkshire.
Sir Guy and Lady Scot-Auckland.
The Count and Countess Demereau.
The Viscount and Viscountess Hillyard.
Mr. and Mrs. Richard Lanser.
Lord and Lady Clanders.
Miss Eliza Doolittle,
Colonel Pickering.
Professor Higgins.
-Your Excellency.
-Miss Doolittle
How do you do?
-Good evening, Colonel.
-Good evening.
What an enchanting young lady you have with you this evening.
Well, who is she?
Oh, a cousin of mine. And Higgins.
Excuse me.
Professor Higgins.
Such a faraway look, as if she's always lived in a garden.
So she has. A sort of garden.
Henry gotta go home.
Here is an expert in languages.
-Sort of, you know, "imposterologist."
-I beg you pardon?
The young lady with Colonel Pickering....
Find out who she is.
With pleasure.
The whole situation is highly explosive.
Tell me, Zoltan, some more about the Greek ambassador.
Gladly, but first I would love you to present me to this glorious creature.
Does he really come from Yorkshire?
Her Majesty, the Queen of Transylvania...
...and His Royal Highness Prince Gregor.
Charming. Quite charming.
Miss Doolittle, Madam.
Miss Doolittle, my son would like to dance with you.
Absolutely fantastic.
A lot of tomfoolery.
It was an immense achievement.
Well, Mr. Higgins?
A triumph, Mrs. Pearce. A total triumph.
Higgins, you were superb, absolutely superb.
Tell us the truth now, weren't you a little bit nervous once or twice?
Not during the whole evening?
Not when I saw we were going to win.
I felt like a bear in a cage hanging about.
It was an immense achievement.
If I hadn't backed myself to do it,
I'd have given up two months ago.
Absolutely fantastic.
Yes, a lot of tomfoolery.
Higgins, I salute you.
The silly people don't know their own silly business.
"Tonight, old man, you did it
You did it, you did it"
"You said that you would do it
And indeed you did"
"l thought that you would rue it
I doubted you'd do it"
"But now I must admit it
That succeed you did"
"You should get a medal
Or be even made a knight"
"Oh, it was nothing, really nothing"
"All alone you hurdled
Every obstacle in sight"
"Now wait, now wait
Give credit where it's due"
"A lot of the glory goes to you"
"But you're the one who did it
Who did it, who did it"
"As sturdy as Gibraltar
Not a second did you falter"
"There's no doubt about it"
"You did it!"
"l must have aged a year tonight
At times I thought I'd die of fright"
"Never was there a momentary lull"
"Shortly after we came in
I saw at once we'd easily win"
"And after that I found it deadly dull"
"You should have heard
The 'oohs' and 'aahs'"
"Everyone wondering who she was"
"You'd think they'd never seen a lady before"
"And when the Prince of Transylvania
Asked to meet her"
"And gave his arm to lead her to the floor"
"l said to him: 'You did it
You did it, you did it'"
"They thought she was ecstatic
And so damned aristocratic"
"And they never knew
That you..."
"...did it"
Thank goodness for Zoltan Karpathy.
If it hadn't been for him
I would've died of boredom
Karpathy? That dreadful Hungarian?
Was he there?
Yes, he was there all right and up to his old tricks.
"That blackguard
Who uses the science of speech"
"More to blackmail and swindle than teach"
"He made it the devilish business of his"
"To find out who this Miss Doolittle is"
"Every time we looked around
There he was"
"That hairy hound from Budapest"
"Never leaving us alone
Never have I ever known"
"A ruder pest"
"Finally I decided it was foolish
Not to let him have his chance with her"
"So I stepped aside
And let him dance with her"
"Oozing charm from every pore
He oiled his way around the floor"
"Every trick that he could play
He used to strip her mask away"
"And when at last the dance was done
He glowed as if he knew he'd won"
"And with a voice too eager
And a smile too broad"
"He announced to the hostess
That she was a fraud"
No!
"Her English is too good,' he said
That clearly indicates that she is foreign"
"Whereas others are instructed
In their native language"
"English people aren't"
"Although she may have studied with an expert dialectician and grammarian"
"l can tell that she was born"
"Hungarian"
"Not only Hungarian but of royal blood"
"She is a princess"
"Her blood,' he said
Is bluer than the Danube is or ever was"
"Royalty is absolutely written on her face"
"She thought I was taken in
But actually I never was."
"How could she deceive
Another member of her race?"
"l know each language on the map"
Said he
"And she's Hungarian
As the first Hungarian Rhapsody"
"Congratulations, Professor Higgins"
"For your glorious victory"
"Congratulations, Professor Higgins"
"You'll be mentioned in history"
Well, thank God, that's over.
Now I can go to bed without dreading tomorrow.
-Good night, Mr. Higgins.
-Good night, Mrs. Pearce.
I think I'll turn in, too. Good night.
It's been a great occasion.
Good night, Pickering.
Mrs. Pearce?
Damn, I meant to ask her to give me coffee in the morning instead of tea.
Leave a little note for her will you, Eliza.
And put out the lights.
Must be downstairs. Oh, darn it.
I'll leave my head behind one of these days.
What the devil have I done with my slippers?
Here are your slippers!
Take your slippers and may you never have a day's luck with them.
What on earth? What's the matter?
Is anything wrong?
No, nothing's wrong with you.
I won your bet for you, haven't I?
That's enough for you!
I don't matter, I suppose?
You won my bet?
You presumptuous insect! I won it!!
Why did you throw the slippers at me?
Because I wanted to smash your face.
I could kill you, you selfish brute!
Why didn't you leave me where you picked me up?
You thank God it's all over. Now you can throw me back again! Do you?
Oh, so the creature's nervous after all?
Claws in, you cat!
How dare you show your temper to me?
Sit down and be quiet!
What's to become of me?
How do I know what's to become of you?
What does it matter?
You don't care. I know you don't care.
You wouldn't care if I was dead.
I'm nothing to you.
Not as much as them slippers.
Those slippers!
Those slippers! I didn't think it meant any difference now.
Why have you suddenly begun going on like this?
May I ask if you complain of your treatment here?
No.
Has anybody behaved badly?
Colonel Pickering, Mrs. Pearce?
No.
Well you don't pretend that I have treated you badly?
No.
Well, I'm glad to hear that.
Perhaps you're tired after the strain of the day.
Would you have a chocolate?
No, thank you.
Well, it's only natural that you should be anxious, but it's all over now.
Nothing more to worry about.
No, nothing more for you to worry about.
Oh, God, I wish I was dead.
Why? In heaven's name, why?
Now listen to me, Eliza.
All this irritation is purely subjective.
I don't understand. I'm too ignorant.
It's just imagination. Nothing's wrong.
Nobody's hurting you.
Go to bed and sleep it off.
Have a little cry and say your prayers.
You'll feel very much more comfortable..
I heard your prayers.
"Thank God it's all over."
Don't you thank God it's all over?
Now you're free, and you can do what you like.
Oh, what am I fit for?
What have you left me fit for?
Where am I to go? What am I to do?
And what's to become of me?
That's what's worrying you, is it?
I wouldn't worry about that if I were you.
I'm sure you won't have any difficulty in settling yourself somewhere or other.
I didn't quite realize you were going away.
You might marry, you know.
You see, Eliza, all men are not confirmed old bachelors like me and the Colonel.
Most men are the marrying sort, poor devils.
You're not bad-looking.
You're really quite a pleasure to look at sometimes.
Not now, when you've been crying.
You look like the very devil, but...
...when you're all right and quite yourself you're what I would call attractive.
Go to bed, have a good rest, get up in the morning...
...and have a look at yourself in the glass.
You won't feel so bad.
I daresay, my mother might find some fellow or other who would do very well.
We were above that at Covent Garden.
What do you mean?
I sold flowers, I didn't sell myself.
Now you've made a lady of me,
I'm not fit to sell anything else.
Oh, tosh, Eliza.
Don't insult human relations...
...by dragging all that cant about buying and selling into it.
Don't marry the fellow if you don't want to.
What else am I to do?
Oh, there are lots of things.
What about the old idea of a florist shop?
I'm sure Pickering'd set you up in one.
He's got lots of money.
He'll pay for all those togs you're wearing.
And that with the hire of the jewelry'll make a big hole in 200 pounds.
Come on now. You'll be all right.
Well, I must be off to bed.
I'm really devilish sleepy.
I was looking for something. What was it?
Your slippers.
Oh, yes, of course. You shied them at me.
Before you go, sir.
Do my clothes belong to me or to Colonel Pickering?
What the devil use would they be to Pickering?
Why bother about that in the middle of the night?
What may I take away with me?
I don't want to be accused of stealing.
Stealing?
You shouldn't have said that.
That shows a want of feeling.
I'm sorry. I'm a common, ignorant girl and in my station I have to be careful.
There can't be any feelings between the likes of you and the likes of me.
Please, will you tell me what belongs to me and what doesn't?
Take the whole damned houseful if you want.
Except the jewelry. That's hired.
Will that satisfy you?
Stop, please.
Will you take these to your room and keep them safe?
I don't want to run the risk of them being missed.
Hand them over! If these belonged to me and not the jeweler, I'd...
...l'd ram them down your ungrateful throat.
The ring isn't the jeweler's.
It's the one you bought me in Brighton.
I don't want it now.
Don't you hit me!
Hit you? You infamous creature!
How dare you suggest such a thing!
It's you who've hit me.
You've wounded me to the heart.
I'm glad. I've got a little of my own back anyhow.
You've caused me to lose my temper.
That's hardly happened to me before.
I don't wish to discuss it further tonight.
I'm going to bed.
Leave your own note for Mrs. Pearce about the coffee..
...for it won't be done by me!
Damn Mrs. Pearce, damn the coffee and damn you!
Damn my own folly for having lavished my hard-earned knowledge...
...and the treasure of my regard and intimacy on a heartless guttersnipe!
"Just you wait, 'Enry 'lggins
Just you wait!"
"You'll be sorry
But your tears will be too late"
"You will be the one it's done to"
"And you'll have no one to run to"
"Just you wait"
"l have often walked down this street before"
"But the pavement always stayed beneath my feet before"
"All at once am I several stories high"
"Knowing I'm on the street where you live"
"Are there lilac trees in the heart of town?"
"Can you hear a lark in any other part of town?"
"Does enchantment pour out of every door?"
"No, it's just on the street where you live"
"And, oh, the towering feeling"
"Just to know somehow you are near"
"The overpowering feeling"
"That any second you may suddenly appear"
"People stop and stare, they don't...."
Darling.
Freddy, whatever are you doing here?
Nothing. I spend most of my nights here.
It's the only place where I'm happy.
Don't laugh at me, Miss Doolittle.
Don't you call me "Miss Doolittle," do you hear? Eliza's good enough for me.
Freddy, you don't think
I'm a heartless guttersnipe, do you?
Darling, how could you imagine such a thing? You know how I feel.
I've written two and three times a day telling you. Sheets and sheets.
"Speak, and the world is full of singing"
"And I am winging higher than the birds"
"Touch, and my heart begins to crumble"
"The heavens tumble
Darling, and I'm--"
"Words, words, words
I'm so sick of words"
"l get words all day through
First from him, now from you"
"ls that all you blighters can do?
"Don't talk of stars burning above"
"If you're in love, show me"
"Tell me no dreams filled with desire"
"If you're on fire, show me"
"Here we are together
In the middle of the night"
"Don't talk of spring
Just hold me tight"
"Anyone who's ever been in love'll
Tell you that"
"This is no time for a chat"
"Haven't your lips longed for my touch?"
"Don't say how much, show me"
"Don't talk of love lasting through time"
"Make me no undying vow"
"Show me now"
"Sing me no song, read me no rhyme"
"Don't waste my time, show me"
"Don't talk of June, don't talk of fall"
"Don't talk at all, show me"
"Never do I ever want to hear another word"
"There isn't one I haven't heard"
"Here we are together in what ought to be a dream"
"Say one more word and I'll scream"
"Haven't your arms hungered for mine?"
"Please don't explain, show me"
"Don't wait until wrinkles and lines"
"Pop out all over my brow
Show me now!"
-Where are you going?
-To the river.
-What for?
-To make a hole in it.
Eliza, darling, what do you mean?
-But I've no money.
-I have.
-Where are we going?
-Where I belong.
Darling, shall I come with you?
"With one enormous chair"
"Oh, wouldn't it be loverly?"
"Lots of chocolate for me to eat"
"Lots of coal makin' lots of 'eat"
"Warm face, warm 'ands, warm feet
"Oh, wouldn't it be loverly?"
Buy a flower, miss?
Yes, please.
Good morning, miss. Can I help you?
Do you mind if I warm my hands?
Go right ahead, miss.
Excuse me. For a second
I thought you were somebody else.
Who?
Forgive me, ma'am. Early morning light playing tricks with my eyes.
Can I get you a taxi?
A lady shouldn't be walkin' alone...
...around London this hour of the morning.
No, thank you.
"Someone's head restin' on my knee"
"Warm and tender as he can be"
"Who takes good care of me"
"Oh, wouldn't it..."
"...be loverly?
Loverly"
Do come again, Mr. Doolittle.
We value your patronage always.
Thank you, my good man. Thank you.
Here. Come 'ere.
Take the missus on a trip to Brighton with my compliments.
Thank you, Mr Doolittle.
Jolly spot this, Harry.
We must visit it more often.
Father?
Oh, no. You see, Harry, he has no mercy.
Sent her down to spy on me in me misery, he did. Me own flesh and blood.
Well, I'm miserable, all right.
You can tell him that straight.
What are you talking about?
What are you dressed up for?
As if you didn't know.
Go on back to that Wimpole Street devil.
Tell him what he's done to me.
What's he done to you?
Ruined me, that's all.
Tied me up and delivered me into the hands of middle-class morality.
And don't you defend him.
Was it 'im or was it not 'im wrote to an old
American blighter named Wallingford..
...who was giving $5,000,000 to found Moral Reform societies...
...to tell him the most original moralist in England was Mr. Alfred P. Doolittle...
...a common dustman?
Sounds like one of his jokes.
You may call it a joke.
It's put the lid on me. Proper.
The old bloke died and left me
4,000 pounds a year in his bloomin' will.
Who asked him to make a gentleman outta me? I was 'appy. I was free.
I touched pretty nigh everyone for money when I wanted it, same as I touched him.
Now I'm tied neck and 'eels and everybody touches me.
A year ago I 'adn't a relation in the world...
...except one or two who wouldn't speak to me.
Now I've 50. Not a decent week's wages amongst the lot of them.
I have to live for others now, not for meself. Middle-class morality.
Come on, Alfie, in a few hours we have to be at the church.
-Church?
-Yeah, church.
The deepest cut of all.
Why do you think I'm dressed up like a ruddy pallbearer?
Your stepmother wants to marry me.
Now I'm respectable, she wants to be respectable.
If that's the way you feel, why don't you give the money back?
That's the tragedy of it, Eliza.
It's easy to say chuck it...
...but I 'aven't the nerve.
We're all intimidated.
That's what we are, intimidated.
Bought up. Yeah. That's what I am.
That's what your precious professor's brought me to.
Not my precious professor.
Oh, sent you back, 'as he?
First he shoves me in the middle-class, then he chucks you out for me to support.
That's all part of his plan...
...but you double-cross him.
Don't you come back home to me.
Don't you take tuppence from me.
You stand on your own two feet.
You're a lady now, you can do it
Yeah, that's right, Eliza.
You're a lady now.
It's getting awfully cold in that taxi.
Here, Eliza, would you like to come and see me turned off this morning?
St. George's, Hanover Square, 10:00.
I wouldn't advise it, but you're welcome.
No, thank you, Dad.
Are you all finished here, Eliza?
Yes, Freddy, I'm all finished here.
Good luck, Dad.
Thank you, Eliza.
Come along, Alfie.
How much time have I got left?
"There's just a few more hours"
"That's all the time you've got"
"A few more hours"
"Before they tie the knot"
There's drinks and girls all over London.
And I gotta track 'em down in just a few more hours.
Set 'em up, me darlin'.
"l'm gettin' married in the mornin'"
"Ding dong, the bells are gonna chime"
"Pull out the stopper
Let's have a whopper"
"But get me to the church on time"
"l got to be there in the mornin'"
"Spruced up and looking in me prime"
"Girls, come and kiss me
Show how you'll miss me"
"But get me to the church on time"
"If I am dancin'
Roll up the floor"
"If I am whistlin'
Me out the door"
"For I'm getting married in the mornin'"
"Ding dong, the bells are gonna chime"
"Kick up a rumpus
But don't lose the compass"
"And get me to the church"
"For God's sake
Get me to the church...
...on time"
"l'm gettin' married in the mornin'"
"Ding dong, the bells are gonna chime"
"Some bloke who's able
Lift up the table"
"But get me to the church on time"
"If I am flyin'
Then shoot me down"
"If I am wooin'
Get her out of town"
"For I'm getting married in the mornin'"
"Ding dong, the bells are gonna chime"
"Feather and tar me
Call out the Army"
"But get me to the church"
"Get me to the church"
...on time"
"Pull out the stopper
Let's have a whopper"
''Girls, come and kiss me
Show how you'll miss me"
"But get me to the church on time"
"If l am dancin'
Roll up the floor"
"If l am whistlin'
Me out the door"
"Drug me or jail me
Stamp me and mail me"
"But get me to the church"
"Get him to the church"
"For God's sake
Get me to the church on time"
"Some bloke who's able
Lift up the table"
"But get me to the church on time"
"Starlight is reelin'
Home to bed now"
"Mornin' is smearin' up the sky"
"London is wakin'"
"Daylight is breakin'"
"Good luck, old chum"
"Good health"
"Goodbye"
"l'm gettin' married in the mornin'"
"Ding dong, the bells are gonna chime"
"Hail and salute me
Then haul off and boot me"
"For God's sake
Get him to the church on time"
Didn't she say where to send her clothes?
I told you, sir, she took them all with her.
Here's a confounded thing. Eliza's bolted.
Last night Mrs. Pearce let her go without telling me about it!
What'll I do? I got tea this morning instead of coffee.
I don't know where anything is, what my appointments are.
-Eliza'd know.
-Damn it, she's gone!
Did either of you frighten her last night?
We hardly said a word to her.
You were there.
Did you bully her after I went to bed?
She threw the slippers at me.
I never gave her the slightest provocation.
The slippers came at my head before I uttered a word.
She used the most disgraceful language.
I was shocked! I don't understand.
We always gave her every consideration.
She admitted it.
I'm dashed!
Pickering, for God's sake, stop being dashed and do something!
Phone the police. What are they there for?
You can't give Eliza's name to the police...
...as if she were a thief or a lost umbrella.
But why not? I want to find the girl.
She belongs to me.
I paid five pounds for her.
Quite right. Hello. Scotland Yard, please?
Get me some coffee, would you please?
Scotland Yard?
This is Colonel Pickering speaking.
27A Wimpole Street.
I want to report a missing person.
Miss Eliza Doolittle.
About 21.
I should say about 5 foot 7.
Her eyes? Let me think now. Her eyes....
-Brown.
-Brown.
Her hair? Good Lord.
Sort of a nondescript neutral sort of--
Brown, brown, brown!
You heard what he said?
Brown, brown, brown, yes.
No. This is her residence. 27A--
Yes, about between 3:00 and 4:00 this morning, I understand.
No.... She's no relation, no.
Well, let's call her a good friend, shall we?
I beg your pardon?
Listen to me, I don't like the tenor of that question.
What the girl does here is our affair.
Your affair is to get her back so she can continue doing it.
Well, I'm dashed!
"What in heaven could have prompted her to go?"
"After such a triumph at the ball"
"What could have depressed her?"
"What could have possessed her?
I cannot understand the wretch at all"
Higgins, I have an old school chum at the Home Office. Perhaps he could help.
Think I'll give him a ring.
Whitehall: 7244, please.
"Women are irrational
That's all there is to that"
"Their heads are full of
Cotton, hay and rags"
"They're nothing but exasperating lrritating, vacillating, calculating"
"Agitating, maddening
And infuriating hags"
I want to speak to Mr. Brewster Budgin, please.
Yes, I'll wait.
Pickering, why can't a woman be more like a man?
I beg your pardon?
Yes, why can't a woman be more like a man?
"Men are so honest, so thoroughly square
"Eternally noble, historically fair"
"Who, when you win
Will always give your back a pat?"
"Why can't a woman be like that?"
"Why does every one do
What the others do?"
"Can't a woman learn to use her head?"
"Why do they do everything
Their mothers do?"
"Why don't they grow up
Well, like their father instead?"
"Why can't a woman take after a man?"
"Men are so pleasant, so easy to please"
"Whenever you're with them
You're always at ease"
"Would you be slighted
If I didn't speak for hours?"
"Would you be livid
If I had a drink or two?"
"Would you be wounded
If I never sent you flowers?"
"Well, why can't a woman be like you?"
"One man in a million may shout a bit"
"Now and then
There's one with slight defects"
"One perhaps whose truthfulness
You doubt a bit"
"But by and large
We are a marvelous sex"
"Why can't a woman take after a man?"
"Cause men are so friendly
Good-natured and kind"
"A better companion
You never will find"
"If I were hours late for dinner
Would you bellow?"
"If I forgot your silly birthday
Would you fuss?"
"Would you complain
If I took out another fellow?"
"Well, why can't a woman be like us?"
Is Mr. Brewster Budgin there?
Bruzzie, you'll never guess who this is.
You're quite right, it is. Good heavens.
By George, what a memory.!
How are you, Bruzzie?
Nice to hear your voice.
What? You don't say.
Has it really been 30 years, Bruzzie?
Right. Yes, oceans of water
Listen, Bruzzie, I'll tell you why I rang up.
Something rather unpleasant has happened. Could I come and see you?
I could, yes. Now, straight away?
Right. Good. Thank you.
Goodbye, Bruzzie. Thank you very much.
Mrs. Pearce, I'm going along to the Home Office.
I do hope you find her, Colonel Pickering.
Mr. Higgins will miss her.
Mr. Higgins will miss her, eh?
Blast Mr. Higgins, I'll miss her
-Mrs. Pearce?
-Yes, sir.
Where's the Colonel?
He's gone to the Home Office, sir.
There you are. I'm disturbed and he runs for help. Now there's a good fellow..
Mrs. Pearce, you're a woman.
"Why can't a woman be more like a man?"
"Men are so decent
Such regular chaps"
"Ready to help you
Through any mishaps"
"Ready to buck you up
Whenever you are glum"
"Why can't a woman be a chum?"
"Why is thinking
Something women never do?"
"And why is logic never even tried?"
"Straightening up their hair ls all they ever do"
"Why don't they straighten up
The mess that's inside?"
"Why can't a woman behave like a man?"
"If I was a woman
Who'd been to a ball"
"Been hailed as a princess
By one and by all"
"Would I start weeping
Like a bathtub overflowing?"
"Or carry on as if my home were in a tree?"
"Would I run off
And never tell me where I'm going?"
"Why can't a woman be like me?"
You mean that after you'd done this wonderful thing for them...
...without making a mistake...
...they just sat there and never said a word?
Never petted you, or admired you, or told you how splendid you'd been?
Not a word.
They just congratulated each other on how marvelous they'd been.
The next moment, how glad they were it was all over...
...and what a bore it had all been.
This is appalling. I should not have thrown my slippers at him.
I should have thrown the fire irons.
Who's that?
Henry. I knew it wouldn't be too long.
Now, remember...
...you not only danced with a prince last night, you behaved like a princess.
Mother, the most confounded thing....
Do you--
You!
Good afternoon, Professor Higgins.
Are you quite well?
Of course you are. You are never ill.
Would you care for some tea?
Don't you dare try that game on me.
I taught it to you.
Get up, come home and stop being a fool.
You've caused me enough trouble.
Very nicely put indeed, Henry.
No woman could resist such an invitation.
How did this baggage get here?
Eliza came to see me this morning and I was delighted to have her.
If you don't promise to behave yourself
I'll ask you to leave.
I'm to put on my Sunday manners for this...
...thing that I created out of the squashed cabbage leaves of Covent Garden?
That's precisely what I mean.
I'll see her damned first.
However did you learn good manners with my son around?
It was very difficult. I should never have known how ladies and gentlemen behave...
...if it hadn't been for Colonel Pickering.
He showed me that he felt and thought about me...
...as if I were something better than a common flower girl.
You see, Mrs. Higgins, apart from the things one can pick up...
...the difference between a lady and a flower girl isn't how she behaves...
...but how she is treated.
For Professor Higgins,
I will always be a florist ...
...because he always treats me as a flower girl and always will.
I'll always be a lady to Colonel Pickering...
...because he always treats me as a lady and always will.
Henry, don't grind your teeth.
The bishop is here.
Shall I show him into the garden?
The bishop and the professor?
Good heavens, no!
I should be excommunicated.
I'll see him in the library.
Eliza, if my son starts breaking up things...
...l give you full permission to have him evicted.
Henry, I suggest you stick to two subjects: the weather and your health.
You've had a bit of your own back, as you say.
Have you had enough and will you be reasonable or do you want any more?
You want me back to pick up your slippers...
...and put up with your tempers and fetch and carry for you.
I didn't say I wanted you back at all.
Then what are we talking about?
Well, about you, not about me.
If you come back you'll be treated as you always have.
I can't change my nature or my manners.
My manners are exactly the same as Colonel Pickering's.
That's not true. He treats a flower girl as if she were a duchess.
I treat a duchess as if she was a flower girl.
I see. The same to everybody.
The great secret is not a question of good manners...
...or bad manners or any particular sort of manner...
...but having the same manner for all human souls.
The question is not whether I treat you rudely...
...but whether you've ever heard me treat anyone else better.
I don't care how you treat me.
I don't mind your swearing at me.
I shouldn't mind a black eye.
I've had one before this.
But I won't be passed over
Get out of my way, for I won't stop for you.
You talk about me as though
I was a motorbus.
So you are a motorbus. All bounce and go and no consideration for anybody.
But I can get along without you.
Don't you think I can't!
I know you can. I told you, you could.
You've never wondered, I suppose, whether...
...whether I could get along without you?
Don't you try to get around me.
You'll have to.
So I can, without you or any soul on earth.
I shall miss you, Eliza. I've learned something from your idiotic notions.
I confess that humbly and gratefully. ell, you have my voice on your gramophone.
When you feel lonely without me you can turn it on. It has no feelings to hurt.
Well, I can't turn your soul on.
You are a devil!
You can twist the heart in a girl just as easily..
...as some can twist her arms to hurt her.
What am I to come back for?
For the fun of it. That's why I took you on.
You may throw me out tomorrow if I don't do everything you want.
Yes. And you may walk out tomorrow if I don't do everything you want
And live with my father?
Yes, or sell flowers.
Would you rather marry Pickering?
I wouldn't marry you if you asked me and you're nearer my age then what he is.
-Than he is.
-I'll talk as I like, you're not my teacher
That's not what I want and don't you think it is.
I've always had chaps enough wanting me that way..
Freddy Hill writes me twice and three times a day. Sheets and sheets.
In short, you want me to be as infatuated about you as he is, is that it?
No, I don't. That's not the sort of feeling
I want from you.
I want a little kindness.
I know I'm a common, ignorant girl, and you're a book-learned gentleman...
...but I'm not dirt under your feet.
What I done...what I did was not for the taxis and the dresses...
...but because we were pleasant together and I come to...came...
...to care for you.
Not to want you to make love to me...
...and not forgetting the difference between us, but...
...more friendly like.
Well, of course. That's how I feel.
And how Pickering feels.
Eliza, you're a fool!
That's not the proper answer.
It's the only answer till you stop being an idiot.
To be a lady, you must stop feeling neglected...
...if men don't spend half their time sniveling over you...
...and the other half giving you black eyes.
You find me cold, unfeeling, selfish, don't you?
Off with you to the sort of people you like.
Marry a sentimental hog with lots of money...
...and thick lips to kiss you, and thick boots to kick you.
If you can't appreciate what you have, then get what you can appreciate.
I can't talk to you.
You always turn everything against me.
I'm always in the wrong.
Don't be too sure you have me under your feet...
...to be trampled on and talked down.
I'll marry Freddy, I will, as soon as I'm able to support him.
The poor devil who couldn't get a job as an errand boy...
...even if he had the guts to try?
Don't you understand?
I have made you a consort for a king!
Freddy loves me.
That makes him king enough for me.
I don't want him to work.
He wasn't brought up to do it as I was.
I'll go and be a teacher.
What'll you teach, in heaven's name?
What you taught me. I'll teach phonetics.
I'll offer myself as an assistant to that brilliant Hungarian.
What, that imposter? That humbug?
That toadying ignoramus?
Teach him my methods, my discoveries
You take one step in that direction,
I'll wring your neck!
Wring away! What do I care?
I knew you'd strike me one day.
That's done you, 'Enry 'lggins, it 'as.
Now, I don't care for your bullyin' an' your big talk.
"What a fool I was"

Eliza, you're magnificent.
Five minutes ago you were a millstone around my neck...
...and now you're a tower of strength.
A consort battleship.
I like you this way.
Goodbye, Professor Higgins.
You shall not be seeing me again.
Mother!
What is it, Henry? What's happened?
She's gone.
Well, of course, dear.
What did you expect?
What am I to do?
Do without, I suppose.
And so I shall.
If the Higgins' oxygen burns up her little lungs...
...let her seek some stuffiness that suits her.
She's an owl sickened by a few days of my sunshine.
Let her go. I can do without her.
I can do without anyone.
I have my own soul!
-My own spark of divine fire!
-Bravo, Eliza.

Oh, we are proud. He ain't above givin' lessons, not 'im. I 'eard 'im say so.
I ain't come here to ask for any compliment...
...and if my money's not good enough,
I can go elsewhere.
Good enough for what?
Good enough for you.
Now you know, don't ya?
I'm come to 'ave lessons.
And to pay for 'em, too...
...make no mistake.
What do you want, my girl?
I want to be a lady in a flow'r shop,
'stead o' sellin'...
...at the corner of Tottenham Court Road.
But they won't take me unless I can talk more genteel. He said he could teach me.
Well, 'ere I am ready to pay. Not askin' any favor, and he treats me as if I was dirt.
I know what lessons cost as well as you do and I'm ready to pay.
I won't give more than a shillin'.
Take it or leave it.
It's almost irresistible.
She's so deliciously low.
So horribly dirty. I'll take it.
I'll make a duchess of this draggle-tailed guttersnipe.
I washed my face and 'ands before I come, I did.
Where the devil are my slippers?
[Wolf howling]
[Howling]
[Man]
* around the lonely campfire
* when the wolves begin to call *
* the riders tell the story
* of the bravest wolf of all *
* the king of all the hunters
* born to lead the rest
* his name became a legend
* across the great southwest
* lobo
* lobo
* lobo
* lobo
* your name will survive
* for no man could bring you in *
* dead or alive
* lobo
* lobo
* lobo
* lobo
* your name will survive
* for no man could bring you in *
* dead or alive
[Man narrating]
Like everything else,
A good legend's got to have a good beginning.
The right bloodline, you might say.
This one began even before lobo's time...
With a wolf famous in his own right.
He was a big, rangy fella.
He used to roam a wide piece of the territory...
Back when it was still empty and mighty fine to look at.
Around the neighborhood, he was known as the fierce one.
In the local Spanish,
El feroz.
The vaqueros had a great deal of respect for him too.
Fact is, it amounted to a kind of a superstition.
Some of 'em claimin' he was a spirit wolf.
Well, this El feroz was lobo's father.
So for breed and blood, lobo came from a good line.
It was in the spring of '89 he was born,
A litter of five pups, two brothers and a couple of sisters.
That's about the usual family for wolves.
Now, these young 'uns are off to a good start on a number of counts.
For one thing, they were lucky just havin' El feroz for their dad.
It's a common thing in nature for the male animal to kill his offspring,
If he can get to 'em.
But the wolf's different.
He's about the best parent there is,
Because he's gentle with his young.
[Whimpering]
The wolf's loyal too.
Somethin' most folks don't realize is that wolves mate for life.
It's for all time.
The male and the female both being devoted to each other and the family.
For a real fine domestic arrangement,
There's probably not another one like it anywhere in nature.
At six weeks of age, lobo wasn't much of a legend,
Not yet anyway.
He was bright-eyed and full of mischief,
But he looked exactly like his brothers and sisters.
And at this stage of the game, nobody would have bet on him as a future king of the range.
About the only thing different maybe,
He was a little more curious than the rest of the litter.
He sort of liked to follow his nose,
Find out what is goin' on around the neighborhood.
But bein' a little new at this, he sometimes followed it too far.
[Yelps, whimpers]
Well, if you're gonna leave your common sense at home when you go travelin',
You're bound to land in trouble.
[Yelping]
Still, the school of hard knocks isn't a bad place to start an education,
And lobo caught on fast.
The truth was, all of his life, he'd be one to learn from experience...
And, what's more important, store it up and remember it.
By now it was plain that the pups were growin' fast...
And about ready for good red meat.
So El feroz checked over his boneyard to see what was left.
The bone he finally dug up was the last one.
Pretty slim pickin's for a hungry family.
[Growling]
About all it was good for was a tug-of-war.
There wasn't enough nourishment in this old soup bone to feed a canary.
[Growling]
El feroz knew it was time to go huntin' again.
* he'll feed his hungry young ones *
* El feroz searched for game *
* but there was not a scent of prey *
* throughout his wild domain
* across the endless wastelands *
* his lonely trail had led
* and then at last he spied them *
Pronghorn antelope, his favorite prey.
* his family would be fed
An antelope's faster than a jackrabbit on the takeoff,
But he can't keep it up forever.
The wolf, on the other hand, is a stayer.
He can hold the pace for hours on end when he wants to.
He can even outlast a good strong horse.
So this is how it was.
El feroz was countin' on one of the herd fallin' behind.
Sure enough, a big pronghorn buck pulled up winded and heavin',
Too tired to go another step.
Now the chase was over.
The rest would be easy,
Except that El feroz wasn't in a hurry to move in for the kill.
He began to work this antelope like a good cuttin' horse,
Headin' it back in the direction they had come.
This was an old, old trick.
If a wolf chased his prey Miles away from where he wanted it...
Say, a half day's journey from a hungry family...
He didn't end things too soon.
Instead, he'd send it along home under its own power.
Back at the den, these little young 'uns were bein' as patient as they could,
Exceptin' it wasn't natural for pups to be very patient when they were hungry.
They growled a little, grumbled a little,
Chewed on things and generally felt sorry for themselves.
If they'd only known it, they really had somethin' to complain about.
A cougar was pokin' around in their vicinity.
And if he found 'em, it could mean trouble.
Real bad trouble.
When one of these big cats was circulatin', nothin' was safe.
Stealthy, tricky,
He'd sneak up soft and silent, never betrayin' his presence,
Never givin' a warning either.
[Snarling]
[Growling]
[Cougar growling]
Seemed like right about now, the wolves had been dealt a losing hand.
[Growling]
Then at the last minute, a wild card turned up.
[Cougar growling]
There was somethin' about cougars that just naturally...
Brought out hatred in cowpunchers.
Of course, the big cats were death on horses and other livestock,
But the resentment seemed more than that almost.
It was kind of unreasoning, and it generally took the form of a rifle bullet.
Now, this went for wolves too.
And right at this moment, little lobo couldn't know how close he was...
To gettin' a lead slug of his own.
About that time, El feroz came home with part of his kill.
Right off, he knew somethin' was wrong.
It didn't take him long to unravel the mystery.
He could have figured it out by the scent alone...
And catchin' sight of the riders only confirmed his conclusions.
Humans had been here, and they'd probably be back.
It was time to pull up stakes and move on.
When the whereabouts of a wolf's den isn't secret anymore,
He'll find himself a new one,
'Cause the one thing he's got to have is privacy.
Of course, when that day comes, father just acts as guide.
It's mother who does all the totin' and carryin'.
All right, dear.
Get a move on.
Let's get goin'.
Since there was only room for one passenger at a time,
Each of the pups had to wait his turn,
But lobo wasn't in the mood for waitin'.
Like a stray on the tail end of the herd, he came taggin' along behind,
Doin' his best to keep up.
[Whimpering]
[Whimpering continues]
[Barks softly]
It was gettin' plainer every minute that he wasn't any Mountain goat.
But if he wanted it this way, his mother seemed willing to let him work it out.
He wasn't a quitter.
No, sir.
He stayed with it, and in the end, he came out on top.
Now, once on the trail, the parents moved along at a steady lope.
It was a little tough on the pups,
Bein' short coupled with short legs tryin' to keep up.
Now, there was no time for the sights,
No time to fool around with strangers.
Bein' the curious one, lobo stopped to say howdy.
The tortoise wasn't much on hospitality.
He just wanted to mind his own business.
Trouble was, he was gettin' a lot of unwanted help.
Finally figurin' to sidetrack his escort,
The old slowpoke veered off the trail.
The sashayin' was over, but the pup was a little late gettin' the point.
By now lobo had forgotten all about his parents.
It was sort of mutual.
Being concerned with house hunting, they had their minds on other things too.
The pup, meanwhile, had taken up with a new sidekick,
Another funny-looking critter in a suit of armor.
Seemed like everybody around here wore it.
Maybe this is what made 'em all so standoffish.
Well, in a matter of bein' friendly,
Lobo decided it was up to him to make the first move.
Now, an armadillo's got tender ears,
About the only thing on him that's unprotected.
Hurt his ears and you've hurt his feelings, for sure.
All this time the family had been coverin' more and more ground,
Gettin' farther and farther away,
And still they hadn't missed lobo.
So at a rather young age, he was left playin' lone wolf...
And findin' it a bit tedious.
He was hot, tired and thirsty.
[Whimpering]
To make matters worse, his feet hurt.
It kind of dawned on him along about this point...
That he was travelin' in circles.
He was lost, just about as lost as they come.
Purely by accident, he stumbled onto a catch basin of rainwater.
Just enough left for a quick drink and a soothing cooling bath...
For his achin' feet.
His wet tracks would have been easy to follow...
If anybody'd come along in time, but that wasn't likely.
The family was a couple of canyons away before they hauled up to count noses.
Now, wolves don't excite easy.
The fact that a pup was missin' didn't mean much.
They figured he was still bringin' up the rear as usual,
And he'd be along in his own good time.
In makin' his rounds,
El feroz had had his eye for quite a spell...
On a deserted badger hole.
With a little fixin', it'd do just fine for a den,
So he took possession.
[Animal snarling, feroz growling]
It appeared the place wasn't vacant, after all.
Tenant was livin' here,
And he wasn't figurin' to move.
Badger's a tough critter to handle, even for a wolf,
And this one wasn't gonna budge for anybody.
[Growling]
[Hissing]
[Badger growling]
He might be small, but he was fast on his feet...
And dead game.
Fact is, it turned out to be quite a dance.
Heel-and-toe and do-si-do all around the hall.
[Snarling]
Finally, El feroz decided to call it quits.
He wasn't gettin' anywhere in this game.
Besides, he had a lost pup to worry about,
And it was time he went lookin' for him.
The first move was to try to pick up his trail.
It would still be fresh enough to follow if the parents could find it,
But that was the big "if."
[Howling]
They tried callin' to him the old pack rallyin' cry,
Hopin' he'd hear it and know enough to answer it.
[Yipping, howling]
There wasn't even an echo, nothin' but silence.
One thing was certain.
They'd better catch up with him soon,
'Cause lobo was courtin' disaster.
[Rattling]
A rattler has a built-in warning system for those who know what it means.
But bein' a greenhorn, lobo didn't get the message.
[Rattling continues]
Sensing he was in danger, he began to call for help.
[Whimpering, howling]
Lucky for him, his parents were within earshot.
[Whimpering continues]
[Rattling continues]
It didn't take long to size up the situation.
They knew exactly what to do.
Draw the snake's attention to themselves.
If they could just keep the rattler busy,
The pup might slip out of the danger zone.
Trouble with this plan, the way out was squeezed a little narrow.
Besides, would the pup know when to come?
[Rattling continues]
From the sidelines, El feroz could see it was a standoff,
And he decided it needed a quick ending.
Once the rattler was rooted out, his play was over.
Now lobo could rejoin his family,
Sore-footed and tuckered out maybe,
But glad to be back where he belonged.
As the weeks went by, lobo branched out more and more on his own,
Traipsing around exploring the countryside.
One fine mornin', he was amblin' along...
Not doin' much of anything,
When he came upon a sight that stopped him in his tracks.
A young antelope was feelin' his oats.
He didn't seem to mind where he was goin'...
Just so long as he got there in a jiffy.
He was a kind of a crazy little cuss,
Rambunctious and full of the old vinegar.
To watch him knock this pup around,
You'd think he'd never heard of wolves eatin' antelopes.
Well, like as not at his age, he hadn't.
[Whimpering]
These two weren't old enough to know they were supposed to be enemies,
So an unusual friendship developed,
One of those things that sometimes happens in nature.
In the weeks that followed, they sort of grew up together.
And when they were three months old, they were still goin' around as pals.
Often as not, their trail led to their favorite hangout,
A little creek runnin' through the neighborhood.
It was a real inviting spot for a couple of dry country young 'uns.
And they didn't need to be told what a swimmin' hole was for.
Naturally, the pup favored the dog paddle.
The other fella's style wasn't as neat maybe,
But it got him where he was goin' just the same.
While all this was goin' on,
They were being spied on by a non-too-friendly raccoon.
She kind of took the attitude that water belonged to water critters...
And not to landlubbers like these.
The raccoon had a family to worry about, too,
And that tended to make her leery of strangers.
Nups are like that though.
The kids couldn't see anything wrong with the visitors.
If it was to be a swimmin' party, they'd join in right now.
Three of 'em would anyway.
The fourth one... well, it took him a little longer to make the plunge.
Whenever you get a passel of small fry together,
It's about the same in nature as with humans.
After a while, their animal energy is apt to bust out in a squabble.
[Growling]
[Screeching]
So the party ended, and wolf and antelope moved on.
Something else had ended too:
Their unusual friendship.
It's just not natural for enemies to prolong an acquaintance.
And as it had to be in such things,
These two came to the fork in the trail.
By the time he was six months old,
Lobo was ready to run with the family pack.
He was bigger now, heavier, more like his dad in every way.
Every way except one, he wasn't much help yet with the hunting.
To El feroz, meantime,
It seemed the hungrier his family got, the scarcer the game got.
More and more civilization was pushing into the parts,
Killing off his prey or crowdin' it out.
* it seemed to old El feroz *
* the trail herd that he saw
* was some new breed of buffalo *
* movin' through the draw
* again there would be plenty
* the wolves would have their fill *
* and so he brought his family *
* to join him in the kill
[Snarls]
Makin' a kill wasn't exactly easy though.
It was a tricky business, even downright dangerous.
If the timing was off, a wolf could get himself kicked senseless.
And if the set-to was a challenge for
El feroz, the old master,
It was somethin' more than that for his pups.
Just when lobo thought he had the thing down pat,
He found himself with a bull by the tail and afraid to let go.
What in blazes do ya do now?
[Calf bawling]
[Lobo growling]
About that time the calf had sense enough to join the rest of 'em.
And now it had protection that was gonna be hard to beat.
El feroz kept dancin' around, keepin' his eye on the calf.
For one thing, it was nearer his size,
And he was figurin' there might be a way to slicker the guards out of position.
Of course, he wasn't foolin' anybody really.
The steers were wise to him and quick to match his move.

[Growling continues]

There'd be another chance.
Put wolves and cattle together and sooner or later there will be a killin'.
When the buffalo were wiped out,
It left cattle as the wolves' only hope for survival.
So El feroz took what seemed his rightful share,
But the cattlemen weren't sharin' with anybody.
And from the very beginning, it was open warfare.
Along about that point, the cowboys got lucky.
The mother was knocked down.
She got right up and went on,
But she wasn't in any shape for a long grindin' chase now.
El feroz lagged back from time to time,
Encouragin' her, hopin' she'd catch up.
But he had the young ones to think of, too, and he had to go on.
The female was gettin' near the end of her rope.
A wounded animal knows when it's reached its limit.
And typical-like, she went off to find a resting place.
Maybe the riders would miss the turnoff...
And give her a much needed breathing spell.
But that's not the way it was to be.
[Gunshots]
* lobo, lobo
* remember this day
* man's bullets have taken
* your mother
* away
* lobo, lobo
* there's no lookin' back
* now you must abandon her
* run with the pack
Never again would lobo forget the smell of gunpowder.
He got to know rifles by sight,
And he wouldn't let man nor horse come within a thousand yards of him.
Yet all the time, he and the family pack kept takin' more and more cattle.
Before long, the cattlemen's battle seemed to be a losin' one.
The enemy was almost too smart.
Maybe it was a war calling for more than guns.
To catch a wolf in those days, the cowman had to learn to think like one.
The trick was to make him outsmart himself.
A wolf's an intelligent critter.
Fact is, there's not many to match him when it comes to figurin' things out.
So if a trap was gonna fool him, it had to be rigged up with some extra special trimmings.
A little dogie was about the most delectable come-on.
There was something about young veal that was well-nigh irresistible.
Once the decoy was staked out,
The next thing was to plant the trap where the wolf would have to pass.
The trap could be most any standard make.
It had to be strong though, like, say, a well-made number 4.
Not big as a bear trap maybe, but big enough...
And smooth workin' with a fast action.
Well, these preparations had been pretty thorough.
You might say they had a touch of genius about 'em,
'Cause next morning it looked like nature herself was in on the deal,
Playin' it on the cattlemen's side.
El feroz came on in the lead.
He was still headin' up the family pack.
And quick as a wink, he spotted the calf.
Naturally, he was tempted, and why not?
A free meal like this.
But before he made any move hasty-like, he sniffed around a bit just checkin' on things.
This all seemed a little too good to be true.
Might be that was what was wrong with it.
Maybe he'd better back off and size things up again.
[Snarling, growling]
Like an unexpected gunshot, the trap sent the young wolves a-scatterin'.
They ducked out of sight quick, all except lobo.
[Snarling, growling]
He sensed something wasn't right.
[Whimpering]
There wasn't much he could do for El feroz except lend him the comfort of his company.
Still, there's a kind of nobleness in the wolf.
In the unexplained way of the breed, he stayed by,
Prepared to keep watch to the end.
Then the riders came back.
Lobo knew he'd have to leave.
He had no choice.
For all wild animals, there comes the moment when they must go their own road.
And for lobo that moment was now.
* the time had come for lobo
* to make his way alone
* and loneliness and hunger
* were things he'd never known *
* all through the long, long winter *
* beneath the frozen sky
* lobo learned he must be strong *
* he must be wise or die
By the next spring, lobo had been a loner about long enough.
It was time to start lookin' for a mate,
And his wanderings took him far from his old haunts into new territory.
One fine morning he met up with some wolves he'd never seen before.
He was of a mind to join 'em.
According to pack law, he might be accepted and he might not.
It sort of depended on whether they wanted him.
As it worked out, they were kind of hankering for a new face too.
Right off, lobo was made welcome.
In the midst of all the jubilation,
He caught sight of a dark beauty on the sidelines,
And he knew his searching was over.
The black female seemed charmed with lobo too.
Before long, an old-fashioned courtship was underway.
Takin' himself a mate wasn't gonna be quite this simple though.
There was a kind of a catch to it.
The one who really had the say was the pack leader,
Surly old brute who right away took a dislikin'...
To the young fella from out of the hills.
The pack leader could see he wasn't winnin'.
And when you're not winnin', you might as well do your losin' the easiest way possible.
No sense gettin' yourself killed just for show.
He just tucked his tail between his legs and gave up, simple as that.
And so the lobo legend began to get a little bigger.
From that time on, lobo ran at the head of the pack...
With his mate at his heels...
And a following of the biggest, strongest wolves in the vicinity.
When the mating season came on, the pack split up for a while,
Each pair of wolves goin' off by itself.
Some of 'em had dens left over from last year.
But lobo and his mate, bein' new at this,
Had to set up housekeeping somewhere brand new.
One day in their scouting, they made a mighty interesting discovery.
Across the canyon was an old Indian cliff dwelling.
Looked like it would just about fill the bill.
Only drawback was, there didn't seem to be any way of gettin' over to it.
Well, where there's a will, there's generally a way.
And it turned out, there was a sort of a crossing.
It was one of those
"as the crow flies" things,
And a wolf wantin' to use it was gonna have to be mighty eager to get on the other side.
This didn't seem to bother lobo though.
After lookin' it over good, he undertook to give it a try.
The wolf's a surefooted critter with strong nerves and a steady eye,
And lobo had all the confidence of the breed.
His mate, meanwhile, hung back.
She wasn't near so sure of herself.
Bein' the female, maybe she wasn't so foolhardy.
Finally, after lobo had showed it could be done,
She got up nerve enough to follow him.
Once underway, it wasn't so bad.
Fact is, in time, these wolves would come to use this bridge practically every day.
It came to be a part of the lobo legend.
The cliff dwelling, when they got to it, looked real inviting.
The scent of man was long gone.
Besides, to these two, it wasn't a house but a cave...
With all the proper advantages of same.
Dry floor, sheltering walls and a good roof against the rain.
This was it, their new den.
The both of 'em were pleased with their find...
And, what's more important, with each other.
These two had mated for life,
And right about now the life ahead looked good.
The next few weeks were pleasant ones, and the days passed quickly.
Then the time came when lobo's mate didn't hunt with him anymore.
One morning when he got home from makin' his rounds, he found out why.
Sure was a handsome litter.
Lobo was as proud as a new daddy could be.
[Mooing]
* as leader of the wolf pack
* his fame began to spread
* for many hundred Miles around *
* a price was on his head
* by every law of nature
* the cattle were his prey

A thousand dollars, a darn sight more than most human outlaws were worth.
Lobo was a legend for sure,
The most notorious name in the whole southwest.
[Hounds baying]
One day a professional hunter from
Texas rode into the territory,
Hopin' to take the famous wolf that nobody else could catch.
Bounty hunting was his full-time trade,
And he came equipped for it.
He had a killer wolfhound so mean it had to be kept muzzled.
This was his hole card.
But first, a wolf had to be brought to bay.
And for this job, he had a pack of the finest trackin' hounds ever gathered together.
If anybody could bring in lobo, looked like this was the man.
[Hounds baying]
[Baying]
[Baying continues]
It didn't take the hunter long to see he'd been outsmarted.
This lobo was a lot wiser than he'd figured.
The truth was, he had a kind of a begrudging admiration...
For a wolf that could think up a strategy like this.
Well, if the dogs couldn't bring this fella in, there were other tricks to be tried.
In lookin' over the situation, he'd noticed somethin' important,
A clue about lobo's habits that just might prove his downfall.
[Jangling]
To anybody who could read the signs,
The giveaway was printed on the ground beside the log.
The wolf tracks here told their own story.
It was plain as anything...
The wolves always came off the log at this spot.
This was the place for a trap.
The hunter took a lot of care in settin' this one.
He picked an extra strong trap with a hair-trigger action.
Used a special trick to keep the dirt from cloggin' it.
Now it was just a matter of time.
It so happened lobo didn't make his usual rounds that day.
He'd stayed home with the family sort of takin' things easy.
His pups were about three months old now,
Gettin' more active every minute.
One of 'em was lobo's particular pride and joy,
The dark little female who was a dead ringer for her mother.
With a family to raise, lobo was apt to be watchin' his step pretty carefully.
The only thing was, this time the man who was out to get him...
Was the best in the business.
When the hunter came back, the trap was gone.
Just as he figured, lobo had come passin' by...
And had stepped down right where he thought he would.
The fact that he wasn't in sight was no cause for worry.
He couldn't have got far
'cause the trap was chained to a heavy drag.
It was leavin' a well-marked trail that would be no trouble at all to follow.
[Whinnying]
It was a wolf, all right, but the wrong one,
Lobo's mate, not the old outlaw himself.
Well, since exterminatin' was his business,
He might as well exterminate her on general principles.
Then a better idea hit him.
If it was lobo he wanted, maybe here was a golden opportunity.
Taken alive, this female was a sure way of gettin' at lobo.
When his mate didn't come home, lobo began to get restless.
He sensed somethin' was wrong.
It wasn't like her to stay away from her pups like this.
He set out to find her, just as the hunter reckoned he would.
At the other end of the bridge, lobo picked up the trail.
His nose told him his mate had been in trouble.
Mixed with her scent was another one, hated and bitter,
A taint in the air he wouldn't ever forget.
* the scent of man told lobo *
* that he must find his mate *
* but the bounty man was usin' her *
* to lure him to his fate
* the trail was plain to follow *
* he traveled hard and fast
* but he would have searched forever *
* to find his mate at last
* lobo
* lobo

* lobo
* there's danger below
* but true to your loyal code *
* there you must go
* lobo
* lobo
* there's danger below
* but true to your loyal code *

Lobo knew the chance he was takin',
The odds against him.
He came on, steppin' soft,
Followin' the fence for protection.
His mate was somewhere near.
His keen nose said so.
Then he found her.
[Whimpering]
She was alive.
Now his problem was how to get to her.
[Whimpers]
[Gunshot]
[Howling]
[Wolves howling]

Well?
Zeus, king of the gods of the Greeks...
...write in the ashes so that I may read the future.
I see...
...a great tree at the end of the world.
And in its branches there hang the skull and the skin of a ram.
They gleam and shine...
...for it is a prize of the gods, a Golden Fleece.
We've no time for riddles and mysteries. Tell me of tonight.
Pelias, you will conquer tonight.
You will overthrow the kingdom of Thessaly.
You will kill the king, Aristo, and wear his crown.
You will do all these things without fear or wound...
...because Zeus commands it.
If I'm protected by Zeus,
I will have no need of this.
I will lay it on the fire as a thank offering to the gods.
Pelias...
...it is also foretold that although you will win the throne of Aristo...
...you will, when Zeus ordains, lose it...
...to one of Aristo's children.
- Then Aristo will have no children.
- He has three, Pelias.
Two daughters,
Philomela and Briseis...
...and a son, Jason.
Then two daughters and a son will die with their father tonight.
Hera, queen of gods, protect this child, my sister Philomela.
And if I, Briseis, am worthy...
...take me into your protection.
Are you Briseis, the daughter of Aristo?
Be silent. She is praying.
For her sister and for her murdered father, Aristo.
Are you a priestess?
I serve the gods.
Then tell me, has Briseis called upon the goddess Hera?
She has.
And has the goddess heard her prayer?
Yes.
Then pray for me.
It is the will of Zeus.
It is not the will of Zeus.
It is your will.
Zeus has given you a kingdom.
The rest will be your own doing.
The gods abandon you, Pelias.
A one-sandaled man shall come...
...and no god shall protect you from him.
A one-sandaled man?
The child who has escaped you:
Jason.
Then why was I not told the whole prophecy?
Why did Zeus drive me to kill this girl...
...when the only one I needed to kill was Jason?
Zeus cannot drive men to do what you have done.
Men drive themselves to do such things...
...that the gods may know them...
...and that men may understand themselves.
The killing of Jason would do you no good.
Kill Jason and you kill yourself.
Zeus, my godly husband, did you, for some reason...
...order the profanation of my temple in Thessaly?
That was entirely the thought of Pelias.
Not content with winning the throne of Thessaly, as I wished...
...he tried to avoid losing it as I have commanded.
I know that you've been insulted, my dear.
But be content.
The boy, Jason, has escaped.
- He will avenge you.
- How?
You must know by now I never arrange exact and precise details...
And because you are neither exact nor precise, a young girl was killed...
...and my temple was profaned.
- I want to help Jason.
- No.
You may help the infant, Philomela, if you wish. She's a girl.
The rest is man's work.
No. I want to help Jason.
As you wish.
How many times did Aristo's daughter
Briseis call upon you?
- By name?
- Five.
Well, then you can help her brother five times.
Five times only you can help him to overthrow Pelias.
And that is my final word.
It will be 20 years before Jason becomes a man.
Oh, an instant of time here on Mount Olympus...
...but a long 20 years for King Pelias.
He cautiously travels the roads of Thessaly.
Yes, Pelias, you have had years of watching and waiting...
...for the man who must come to kill you.
The man with one sandal.
I owe you my life.
That was as good a way to ford a river as any.
But I seem to have lost a sandal in doing it.
Where are you traveling?
To the palace of the king.
- Pelias?
- Pelias of Thessaly.
Then I can put you on your way.
But first, you must accept the hospitality of my camp.
Come.
Be seated.
You have not yet told me your name.
I am Jason, the lawful king of Thessaly.
One of my father's soldiers rescued me and brought me up in exile.
Now I've returned to claim my kingdom.
I have waited for you for 20 years.
And in that 20 years,
Pelias has turned my kingdom...
...from the pride of Greece to a savage, evil land.
I shall need your help.
When your father defended his throne, no man fought harder than I.
This time it will not be enough to fight.
I could fight.
I could find Pelias and kill him.
But the people need more than a leader.
They must believe the gods have not deserted them.
- They need a miracle.
- And where will you find this miracle?
I have heard there is a tree at the end of the world...
...with a fleece of gold hanging in its branches.
I have heard this too.
So have many men.
They say it is a gift of the gods.
It has the power to heal, bring peace and rid the land of plague and famine.
If I could find this prize and bring it home to Thessaly...
...then it would inspire the people, wipe out the years of misrule.
They would know the gods have not abandoned them.
My land would be rich and strong again...
...as it was before this tyrant, Pelias, murdered my father.
Jason...
...be advised by me.
First, search for this Golden Fleece.
Do not reveal yourself to Pelias, but build a ship...
...and find a crew, and when you have this prize...
...then and only then...
...return and kill Pelias.
And now rest yourself.
My companions are yours to command.
Father, why do you let him live?
If I destroy him, Acastus,
I destroy myself.
While he is searching for the Golden Fleece...
...he is at the ends of the earth and I am safe.
And if he finds it?
You will be there.
Have you come to pray to the gods, Jason?
If I had, I wouldn't have chosen a fallen one.
Only a statue.
Sometimes the gods argue amongst themselves.
Then great winds blow...
...and temples fall.
- Hermes.
- Yes?
No, I said the statue was the god Hermes.
- Hermes.
- Yes.
A bringer of dreams and a prowler of the night.
Jason.
No man can tell you how to find the fleece.
Is it not time you asked the gods?
They will not answer those who believe in them.
Why should they answer one who doesn't?
Come with me.
Why?
So that you will believe...
...and be answered.
You win, my lord.
That is, the battle, not the war.
Oh, those waters are far too shallow for galleys.
Hera, my dear, you really must learn to win without cheating.
Or at least to lose gracefully.
- Greetings, Hermes.
- Greetings, my lord Zeus.
There seems to be a piece missing.
Perhaps I can help.
Welcome to Olympus, Jason.
Jason come to Mount Olympus at last.
No man calls upon the gods unless he wants something.
We arranged for you to be brought here by Hermes.
I wouldn't have believed a mortal could ask the help of the gods...
...much less visit them.
Well, at least you're honest.
Which is more than I can say for most other mortals.
What is it you want?
A ship? A crew?
No. Those I can find myself.
And what are you going to use in place of gold?
The hearts of men.
I am Hera, queen of the gods and your protector on this voyage.
But my lord Zeus has decreed a limit to the number of times...
...I may help you when you call upon me. Do not speak now.
I know what you must ask of me.
Does the Golden Fleece exist?
And if so, where is it?
That's two questions.
And I shall help him with only one answer.
Search in the land of Colchis.
Then it does exist.
But Colchis...
That's the end of the world.
No Greek has ever sailed there.
Now that you've heard that...
...are you so sure that you will not need my help?
Think carefully.
I offered him a ship.
A ship and a crew.
And he refused me.
Refused the help of the gods?
What ship is strong enough to reach to the edge of the world?
What crew brave enough to sail in her?
I shall tell the shipbuilders of Greece...
...that the richest cargo in the world waits in Colchis.
The Golden Fleece is worth a kingdom.
I shall say that only the strongest ship ever built will survive the voyage.
The athletes of Greece are proud.
I'll tell them only the best can expect a place...
...in the most perilous voyage in history.
I shall announce a games...
...invite the strongest and bravest of the Greeks.
No greater games shall ever be held...
...unless the gods decree otherwise.
I did well to choose you, Jason.
The gods are best served by those who want their help least.
Welcome, Polydeuces.
Castor of Sparta.
Acastus of Thessaly.
Well done, Acastus.
Phalerus of Athens, champion archer of Greece.
Euphemus of Taenarum.
Spyros of Syracuse.
Hercules!
He's here!
I mean to sail with you, Jason. Tell me which champion you want me to beat.
No one. I know you can beat us all.
Your place is reserved.
Hercules. Yes.
- Hercules?
- Yes.
My name is Hylas.
Like you, I came too late to compete in the games.
But it occurs to me that if I can beat you at something...
...Jason couldn't refuse me a place on the ship either.
After all, he might need brains as well as brawn.
Shall we compete?
Discus?
Come on.
- See that rock?
- Yes.
No thrower has ever reached it.
And is the contest to hit it or pass it?
You'll be lucky if you get halfway.
- Now, go on.
- No, after you, Hercules.
I've never thrown a discus before.
I'd like to see how it's done.
Let Hylas have his moment of triumph while he may.
You shall have your place, Hylas.
Hail Hylas!
I have found the finest crew in all Greece.
Now for a ship that is worthy of them.
Argos.
- Argos.
- Hello?
Is that you, Argos?
- Who's there?
- It's Jason.
Come aboard.
So you've come back again.
She's a fine ship.
Yes.
She is a fine ship.
She's ready to sail.
We've yet to give her a name.
I'll call her the Argo, after her builder.
The Argo?
Well, you'd better have a look at the figurehead.
It might make you change your mind.
No, this way.
- Is it forward?
- No, it's astern.
We'll have to move it.
It's supposed to watch over the water ahead of the vessel.
I can't help that.
Something made me put it here.
Hera, queen of the gods.
- What?
- Nothing.
You don't object to it here?
- No.
- Nor do I.
It makes me feel someone friendly is watching over us.
- When do we sail?
- Tomorrow.
Don't waste it.
There isn't enough left to make any difference, Jason.
Oh, let him rest.
But the sooner we find some island with water, the better.
We can't row much longer on three sips a day.
Take my advice. Put back to Icos.
But we'd lose five days' sailing.
We haven't water enough for tomorrow...
...let alone the time it would take to reach Icos.
Don't worry, Hylas.
I don't expect him to take my advice.
But I wish he'd listen to someone.
Still grumbling?
Sailors always grumble.
These sailors have something to grumble about.
Hardly any water. Blistered hands.
- They should use brine.
- Brine?
It toughens the skin.
Well, go down and treat them.
I'll steer.
Hera.
You said you could help me a certain number of times.
So far, you've told me of Colchis.
And I threw Pelias from his horse and dragged him beneath the water.
Pelias?
So that was King Pelias.
I know your need.
Set sail and steer north.
- You will reach land at noon.
- Where?
The Isle of Bronze.
I've never heard of it.
No mortal has.
It was the foundry of the gods.
Hephaestus labored there, making armor and weapons for Zeus.
Oh, do not fear. Hephaestus himself has long departed.
I will see that you reach the Isle of Bronze.
But listen to me, Jason.
Listen very carefully.
- Take the helm.
- Yes, sir.
Set sail.
We reach land at noon.
Then you can fill your bellies until they grumble as much as your tongues.
Now, mark this.
It will be safe to take food and water.
But nothing else.
Absolutely nothing else.
That doesn't include women?
If there are any on the island, yes, it does.
If I meet a girl with a firm leg, a full bosom and a warm heart...
...let no man try and stop me.
- Talos will.
- Who's Talos?
You do mean there's a man there who wants a fight?
I spoke of no man.
Food and water, Hercules.
That's all.
Jason, who told you of this island?
The goddess Hera.
Port helm.
Steady as you go.
Furl the sail.
Ashore for food and water.
- Are goats good sailors?
- Goats? What are you talking about?
What do you want with goats onboard ship?
Well, some of us might be hungry...
...or thirsty.
Come on.
Here's one for the pot.
Hercules.
Isn't he one of the Titans?
He might be. He's big enough.
Didn't Jason say something about Talos?
This must be where Hephaestus molded the statues of the gods.
Yes. And set them up for all the world to see.
Hercules.
It's a treasure chamber.
The treasure chamber of the gods.
Look at this.
And this.
A pearl.
It's a javelin.
Don't be silly. In a jewel box?
It's a brooch pin.
Well, whatever it is, it'll make a useful weapon.
Let's get back to the ship.
- Hercules.
- Well, what is it?
- You'd better put it back.
- Why?
- Remember what Jason said?
- It won't be missed.
Anyway, if the gods leave all this lying about unguarded...
...they obviously don't want it.
Come on.
It must have been the wind.
And you saw nothing of them after that?
Perhaps Hercules found a woman after all.
Talos.
- Back water.
- Back. Back water.
Back.
I warned you, Jason.
This is Hercules' doing.
Talos will try to kill all of you.
How can I fight him?
Think before you waste the gift of the gods.
Against a man of bronze, our weapons are useless.
I repeat that question.
Then I must answer it.
Fight Talos with your wits rather than your courage.
And look to his ankles.
His ankles?
There is nothing else I can tell you.
Jason.
You disobeyed my order.
Lure him to these rocks, but stay out of reach.
- And what will you do?
- I shall hide here, Acastus.
I shall do my very best to send him to you, Jason.
My very best.
Mind his foot!
Quick, get back to the rocks.
Hylas.
Hercules, you've left your...
- Well?
- We searched, Argos.
And I will search again.
Hylas was with us.
We saw him running.
But then he disappeared.
He could've been hurt, not able to get back to the ship.
Like Palinuros.
We had to carry him aboard.
Hercules, Hylas is dead.
The gods decided it.
Why kill a boy for my grave fault?
But I should have stayed with him.
Search until nightfall.
We won't sail till then.
Sail when you please, Jason.
I cannot leave this island till I've found Hylas.
Jason.
Will you abandon Hercules, the best man among us?
- I, for one, won't sail without him.
- Nor shall I.
Nor I.
Come with me.
Hylas!
Is there any man here who does not obey the gods?
We will do as the goddess Hera commands, if she will speak to us.
This is your last chance, Jason.
The last time that I can help you.
I understand.
Then know this, Argonauts.
- Hylas is dead.
- Hylas is dead.
As for Hercules, he is not fated to go further with the Argo.
Zeus has other tasks for him.
And for us, Hera?
Sail to Phrygia.
Seek out Phineas, the blinded man.
Only he can guide you now.
We set sail.
Come on, back to your places.
Back to your places.
Get forward there.
Go away!
Devils! Demons!
Lord Zeus, I was a sinner.
I've never tried to deny it.
But I didn't sin every day.
Why, then, do you punish me every day?
What in the name of the gods are they?
Jason.
- Are you Phineas?
- Yes.
Take my arm. I can't see yours.
Don't flinch.
Zeus gave me the gift of prophecy, but I misused it...
...so I was blinded.
Zeus ordered the Harpies to torment me.
You, Jason, now listen to me.
The gods have ordered me to tell you whatever you want to know.
But the gods have gone too far with me.
They can punish a man so much, and then one day he abandons them.
He says, "All right, Zeus.
Throw a thunderbolt.
Let the earth swallow me.
I defy you."
You growl away all you like, Zeus.
I mean what I say. Jason.
I'll tell you what you want to know...
...only if you'll meet my price.
What is your price then?
Free me from these tormenting Harpies.
If Zeus sent those creatures to plague him...
...we'd be unwise to interfere.
That's my price.
Then we'll meet it, Phineas.
We'll make you the master of the Harpies.
Get to the ropes!
Now.
Castor. Phalerus.
Find some wood to build a cage.
Here you are, you hungry fellow.
A big fish for you and some more wine.
Well, Phineas, we've completed our part of the bargain.
- What is it you want to know?
- The way to Colchis.
The way to Colchis is through the Clashing Rocks.
Steer northwest and you'll reach them in five days.
Northwest, eh?
After the Clashing Rocks, you turn northeast.
Before long, you'll sight the shores of Colchis.
But tell me, what gods protect you?
None now.
Then you won't pass the Clashing Rocks.
- What are the Clashing Rocks?
- They speak for themselves, don't they?
All I can offer you is this.
It's not much reward for what you've done...
...but it's all I have.
If that's all you can tell us, then goodbye.
The gods be merciful to you.
Phineas, from now on, they'll witness a banquet every night...
...and eat the scraps you leave.
Good appetite.
There's not much water here.
Steady as you go. Row easy.
Easy, all.
Easy, all!
It's a narrow channel...
...but I can't see what made Phineas so frightened.
It looks calm enough.
Too calm.
Acastus!
I know the sea god's moods.
But most of them are dangerous.
Acastus, take a sounding.
The rest of you, be prepared to row when I give the word.
But an easy stroke.
Save your strength.
They may need it later.
Ship ahoy!
There she is.
She doesn't seem to be in any great difficulty.
A whole ship's crew.
And Lynceus from the masthead.
There was no hope of saving him, not in that sea.
Are we going through?
- Yes.
- But it's...
All right, we're going through.
Back to your places.
There's no turning back now.
No, Acastus.
There's no turning back on this voyage.
Drummer, beat out the stroke...
...but keep it easy.
The gods want their entertainment.
Jason goes too far.
Because he speaks the truth when the gods themselves go too far?
Turn back, Jason. We're trapped.
- Trapped, Hera.
- It seems so.
You've left me only one move.
Pray to the gods, Jason.
The gods of Greece are cruel.
In time, all men shall learn to do without them.
Pull! Pull!
Get back to your place.
Pull!
Pull till your hides crack and your backs break.
Pull!
Keep the stroke going.
Jason dared to speak of the end of the gods...
...and yet you let him live.
If I were to punish every blasphemy,
I'd soon lose all loyalty and respect.
You are the god of many men.
Yet when those men no longer believe in you...
...then you'll return to nothing.
You understand that, and yet you remain with me.
You think it weak of me, my lord?
Not weak.
Almost human.
Whichever god or goddess helped us...
...is to be thanked.
Those others weren't so fortunate.
What's that?
Who are you?
Your ship was lost.
We found only two other survivors.
They're being looked after.
Here. Drink this.
When did you sail from Colchis?
Dawn, this morning.
Dawn?
Then our journey is nearly over.
- Where have you come from?
- Thessaly.
But that's the other side of the world.
You don't look like a merchant.
Your vessel's a fighting ship.
We'd be foolish to sail unarmed.
By all accounts, your king, Aeetes, fears the gods...
...and we were sent by the gods.
But I'm gonna talk to him alone, peacefully.
Now you answer a question.
What was your ship doing in such dangerous waters?
We came to sacrifice to the gods of the rocks...
...to throw flowers onto the sea to make it safe for our ships.
I'm afraid our gods were angry, not so powerful as yours.
Are you a priestess?
I serve in the temple of Hecate.
A dancer.
Is Hecate the god of the Colchians?
The goddess.
But I'd heard they worship some strange idol...
...the skull and skin of a ram.
No ordinary ram.
Its fleece is of gold.
A gift of the gods themselves...
...and it's brought our city great peace and prosperity.
We'll put you ashore at dawn tomorrow.
Perhaps you will show me the way to the city.
Now, tell me your name.
Medea.
And you can answer my first question.
- Who are you?
- My name is Jason.
Within a few hours, we shall sight Colchis.
I'm coming in quietly by night.
Now the voyage is over,
I don't want the trouble to begin.
Won't be any trouble, Jason.
Just tell us where the city is and when we attack.
We don't attack.
But that's foolish. You have the finest fighting men in the world.
Forty fighting men against a nation?
Better 40 than one, Jason.
We're not pirates, Phalerus.
What's that girl done to you?
We thought you were a fighting man.
I'm going up alone in the morning to see what the situation is.
Oh, you mean spy out the land.
Well, why alone?
Why not take a few of us scouting?
The fewer who go, the less can get caught.
- What's the fewest you can think of?
- One, of course.
Right. I accept your advice.
But I don't.
Having sailed this far together, we're free to speak our minds.
And what's on yours, Acastus?
We nose our way upstream, rush the guards and seize the fleece.
We'd be out into the open sea while Aeetes is still asleep.
- A night attack?
- Yes.
And in the dark, during the attack, a man will die.
That man will be me.
A javelin in my back.
A Greek javelin, Acastus.
Maybe your javelin.
- You'll die for that, Jason.
- Keep back.
Euphemus.
It's Euphemus. He's dead.
Look at this. Slashed and bloody.
Acastus must be at the bottom of the sea.
I wonder.
- Make sail.
- And Euphemus?
The sea was his kingdom while he was alive.
Let it take his body now he's dead.
Make sail.
Make sail!
You're wounded.
We have a flower in Colchis which heals and soothes.
Tomorrow, I'll show you.
What do you call the flower?
It has no name.
It grows on a double stalk.
They say it sprang from the blood of Prometheus.
And it has been used over the years for its soothing and curing powers.
The sun's getting higher.
We must be on our way.
Follow the road to the east.
You're not coming further?
I go another way.
The goddess Hecate has spoken.
There will be one among us today...
...from the ends of the world.
His name is Jason.
Any man of whom he asks his way...
...shall say this:
"Aeetes, king of Colchis...
...awaits him in the temple of Hecate."
And that is all any man shall say to him.
Come forward, Jason.
You have done all of us a great service.
Tonight, we shall feast you.
We know of your great heroism, and it deserves celebration.
Return, then, to your companions and bring them to my palace.
I thank you, my lord...
...but I do not understand.
- Medea?
- Welcome to Colchis.
I give you Jason and the Argonauts.
Jason and the Argonauts!
Tell me, Jason, why did you come to Colchis?
In peace.
I said "why," not "how."
Altogether, how many men have you?
Enough.
And you say you do not threaten us?
Envoys who come to me in deceit remain in death.
I know you've come for the fleece.
I know, too, that if you cannot win it by bargaining, you plan to steal it.
But we'll never part with it, Jason.
It is a gift of the gods.
It has brought wealth and peace to Colchis.
Should we ever let it go, it would mean plague and famine...
...and the destruction of our country!
We can no longer welcome or entertain you...
...but treat you as you deserve.
As thieves...
...as pirates...
...as murderers.
We give our thanks to one person.
The person who exposed a criminal attempt on our kingdom:
The son of King Pelias of Thessaly...
...Acastus.
Hail!
Hecate, queen of darkness...
...you've always helped me.
Tell me now what I must do.
You, who gave me the gift of foresight...
...why didn't you reveal to me
Acastus' treachery?
He who sits drinking with Aeetes...
...while Jason...
...imprisoned, condemned to death.
If I help him now in the quest for the fleece...
...I shall be a traitor to my country...
...and to you, Hecate.
And if not...
...to myself.
Help me, Hecate.
Medea.
Why did you come here?
Was it Aeetes who sent you?
I came to ask you to give up your quest...
...and sail away with the Argonauts in peace.
Never return.
Never to think of the Golden Fleece?
Never to think of the fleece.
Then it was Aeetes.
You tell him I will fulfill the task the gods have sent me...
...and never betray the Argonauts, whatever he offers me.
Even if it's Medea, high priestess of Hecate.
Please...
...forget the Golden Fleece.
I fear for your safety.
If you're set on carrying it away...
...I must come with you.
I'll go alone.
No.
I have to go with you.
I have no country now.
And I love you.
Castor, Phalerus, Dmitrius, get to the door.
The rest of you, back to your places.
- The priestess.
- Argos, listen to Medea.
When you're clear of the palace, go to the ship and row downstream.
There's a break in the cliff and a path through the woods.
Anchor there. We'll join you.
Well, what is it?
- Jason has escaped.
- And his men?
They were all gone. I was making my rounds, found the guards drugged.
Drugged?
Then there's an accomplice.
- Where's Acastus?
- He's not in his quarters.
Acastus help Jason?
But there's no reason to it.
Unless it was Medea who mixed the drug.
The high priestess of Hecate?
I saw how Medea looked at Jason.
If Medea's helping them, then she's guiding them to the Golden Fleece...
...and the Argonauts will take ship.
The landward way is shorter.
Muster your men, captain.
Listen.
Soldiers.
Phalerus, Castor, you come with me.
- No, not you, Polydeuces.
- But, Argos...
You stay aboard with the rest of the men and guard the ship.
Jason.
Aeetes and the Colchians.
We heard them from the ship.
They must be somewhere near.
Get the fleece.
Guards, follow them up there and that way.
Wait.
Hecate, queen of darkness...
...revenge yourself against the Thessalians.
Deliver to me the children of the Hydra's teeth...
...the children of the night.
The teeth.
Fetch me the Hydra's teeth, quickly.
Against the children of the Hydra's teeth...
...there is no protection.
The fleece. Give me the fleece.
It has the power to heal.
It's true.
It does have the power to heal.
Jason!
Hold the guards back, captain, or they may die...
...killed with Jason and his pirates.
Rise up, you dead, slain of the Hydra.
Rise from your graves and avenge us.
Those who steal the Golden Fleece must die.
Argos, get down to the ship.
- Take Medea.
- Come with me.
There.
And there.
And still another.
Wait.
And more.
Destroy them!
Kill!
Kill, kill, kill them all!
Get back.
I think that proves at last that I'm a worthy opponent, my lord.
Where are you going?
- To clear the board. The game is over.
- It certainly is not.
For the moment let them enjoy a calm sea...
...a fresh breeze and each other.
The girl is pretty, and I was always sentimental.
But for Jason there are other adventures.
I have not yet finished with Jason.
Let us continue the game another day.
Will you stop your daydreaming,
Tommy Stubbins?
- Hello, Matt.
- Come and help me select a suitable dinner...
- for me clients here.
- Can I push the barrow?
Well, it's not gonna push itself now, is it?
It's against my religion to do anything violent till the end of the day.
God bless all Irishmen.
You know what I was thinking, Matt?
- No, what was that?
Not for you, me darling.
It'll make your fur fall out.
I was thinking that if you sold your fish barrow, and I sold my grandfather's watch, we could buy a boat and go to China.
Oh. Oh, you're the middle and two ends of a fine fellow, Tom.
It's a beautiful proposition, but don't you see the problem?
- What's that?
- Well, do you speak Chinese?
- No.
- Then, if you sell your grandfather's watch, and we go to China, how are you goin' to tell the time?
- I never thought of that.
- Ah, well, you see, you have to plan ahead.
It's very important.
I mean, the whole secret of my success with the fish barrow... was years of planning ahead.
Thank you, Charlie.
May the 17 holy men of Donnybrook reward you in heaven.
I'd sooner you rewarded me down here.
- Who's this then?
- Wild duck off the marshes.
- Is that a fact?
- Flew straight into the mast, cross-eyed fool.
Can you imagine that now?
He was probably under the influence.
He looks Irish to me.
Don't worry.
I'll fix him up.
Bring him back.
That's my dinner.
Now don't ask me to do that, Charlie.
As Secretary for the Preservation of Irish Ducks, it's more than me job is worth.
You never told me you were secretary of Irish ducks.
Oh, well, now I don't talk about it much.
- I'm a very modest fella.
- What are we going to do with it then?
Well, now, as soon as
I finish me deliveries, we'll take him over to John Dolittle.
- Here.
- Who's John Dolittle?
Eat hearty, me lovelies.
- And heaven bless all Catholic pussycats.
- Who is John Dolittle?
John Dolittle is the greatest animal doctor in the world today... and a close personal friend of Matthew Mugg.
He lives right here in Puddleby, he does.
- Out on the Oxenthorpe Road.
- What does he do?
He's a genius. That's what he does.
He can talk to animals.
- Talk to them?
- Speaks their language, he does.
Just like you and me's chatting now.
He'll have a word with that little fellow in wild duck talk... and put him straight in no time.
Oh, the darlin' man.
He'd think nothin' of travelin' halfway round the world to cure a sick sparrow.
Only last week, he went all the way to Africa.
Ask me why.
- Why?
- Why? I'll tell you.
To look after a crocodile with toothache.
He's altogether a marvelous man.
And he understands the Irish.
And any man who understands the Irish
Can't be reckoned altogether bad
The same way that the lunatic
Whose patron saint is Patrick
Can't be reckoned altogether mad
The doctor's very smart
He's an Irishman at heart
His favorite color
Sure it must be green
And also he's a man
Who'll blarney when he can
Let me explain the sort of thing I mean
My friend the doctor says the moon is made of apple pie
And once a month it's eaten by the sun
And that is why up in the sky
You'll find as every month goes by
Somebody in the sky is making another one
My friend the doctor says the sun is made of cheddar cheese
The doctor even knows the reason why
The facts are these
Try if you please
Pretending you're a lonely cheese
Wouldn't you want to try finding an apple pie
Of course you would.
Maybe what the doctor tells me
Isn't altogether true
But I love every tale he tells me
I don't know any better ones
Do you?
My friend the doctor says the world is full of fantasy
And who are you and I to disagree
Let's hope and pray that is the way
The life we love will always stay
For my friend the doctor
And me
La, la, la, la
Here, Tom, catch!
My friend the doctor says the stars are made of lemon drops
The bigger ones are lollipops and ice  Come on!
The clouds have shops up on the top
That sells you sweets and soda pop
What do they call the place
-  Isn't it paradise
My friend the doctor says that every time it starts to rain
And people run indoors again in swarms
If you remain out in the rain
You'll think you're drinking pink champagne
And you'll spend your life praying for thunderstorms
Maybe what the doctor tells me
Isn't altogether true
But I love every tale he tells me
I don't know any better ones
Do you?
My friend the doctor says the world is full of fantasy
And who are you and I to disagree
Let's hope and pray that is the way
The life we love will always stay for my friend the doctor
My friend the doctor and me
What was that?
- Ah, now, that's just some of his pets.
- Pets?
Polynesia, me lovely little darling.
Give us a kiss then. Here.
And, Chee-Chee, how are you, me old rascal?
I'd like you to meet one of me dearest friends. Master Thomas Stubbins.
Tom, this is Miss Polynesia.
How do you do, Master Stubbins?
How do you do, Miss Polynesia?
You wanna watch out for her, Tom.
She's 199 years old.
She can remember every single word that's been spoken to her... since the execution of Charles I in 1648.
- Isn't that right, Polynesia?
- No, Matthew, 'twas 1649.
'Twas a Tuesday.
Oh, yeah, right.
You see what I mean?
And this is Chee-Chee.
- How do you do, Chee-Chee?
- Where's the good doctor?
- He's working in the library.
Show them in, Chee-Chee.
I know he's in there.
Good heavens, Matthew.
Oh, I'm terrible sorry. I must have frightened them out of their lives.
Matthew, you're soaking wet.
You're a little on the damp side yourself, sir.
Oh, it's these fish languages.
They really only work underwater.
It's fascinating.
The basic system is mouth movements and bubble signals.
At the moment,
I can only make big bubbles, and they keep telling me I'm shouting.
Beggin' me ignorance, sir, but what can you hope to get out of a conversation with a goldfish?
Matthew, I'll show you.
The legendary great pink sea snail.
For hundreds of years, sailors have claimed that they've seen it.
Oh, poor devils.
It's that rotten stock they drink.
But, uh, what has this got to do with goldfish?
I don't believe it's legendary.
I believe it actually exists.
What's that got to do with goldfish?
Well, I'm planning a voyage to find it.
That is, if I can get enough money together.
Oh, may the saints reward you, sir.
But, uh, what's that got to do with the...
Well, if I find it, Matthew,
I'm going to want to talk to it.
Therefore, I have to acquire a knowledge of ancient shellfish, which is extremely complicated.
So, I'm starting with basic fish languages, like halibut, mackerel and goldfish.
Ah, there, you see? I knew it had something to do with goldfish.
Now, about your last voyage, Doctor.
Did, uh, did you find the crocodile with a toothache?
Crocodile?
Oh, yes, in the Congo, yes.
I got back on Saturday.
- Look.
- Isn't that a beauty now?
Make a marvelous bottle opener.
Look at that, Tom.
Oh, forgive me, Doctor.
- This is me ol' pal, Tommy Stubbins.
- How do you do, sir?
- He's brought a patient for you.
- It's a duck, sir.
- It's a drake.
You're sopping wet too.
- Yes, sir, it's raining.
He's hurt his wing, sir.
- Yes, so he's been telling me.
Oh, quack, quack.
Oh, poor chap, yes.
Sorry.
Quack, quack.
He had a row with his wife and wasn't looking where he was going.
He told you all that?
They're very neurotic creatures.
You'll be all right by the morning.
Yes, I'll get word to your wife.
Quack, quack, quack.
Now, while our friend's convalescing,
I'll try and find you something dry to wear.
Then, we all can have some food together.
- Polynesia, two more for dinner.
- Yes, Doctor.
Oh, and, Matthew, hold on to that crocodile's tooth.
Must be a bottle somewhere you can open with it.
Gub-Gub.
Will you please stop making that infernal noise?
A few pork sausages and a bit of bacon.
The way you're carrying on, you'd think we were cooking your entire family.
Chee-Chee, make him behave.
But you can hardly blame him for being a bit upset, Doctor.
I'd be upset meself if you started frying Irishmen.
You know the problem as well as I do, Matthew.
I've nearly 600 mouths to feed, including the mice.
- Six hundred!
- Yes. So if the butcher... gives me a string of sausages now and then, I take it, whether it upsets Gub-Gub or not.
Anyway, he eats more than any of us.
Sure you won't be having anything?
- Quite sure. Thank you, Matthew.
- Aren't you hungry, Doctor?
Yes, but I follow a very special diet, Stubbins.
- It's highly nutritious and very good.
- Oh, I see.
The doctor's in rather an awkward position, you see, Tom.
- Aren't you, Doctor?
- What do you mean, Matt?
You understand, Stubbins, he means meat.
It upsets the animals if I, uh...
- Oh, of course.
- So I don't.
As a matter of principle, one should always try to avoid eating one's friends.
The day that I became a veterinarian
I had a sudden overwhelming wish
To be a pure and simple vegetarian
And give up eating all that meat and fish
- I think that's marvelous.
- Meat is very unhealthy for you.
So now I live on healthy food instead
Like apple cores and parsnip juice
And chunks of plain brown bread
All right, all right.
I'm coming.
When I see my fellowman consuming sirloin steak
And I find myself enjoying tea and Dundee cake
There is really only one conclusion I can make
I'm a devoted vegetarian
No, no, no, no, you've had yours.
When my host at dinner offers succulent roast beef
Proudly I refuse it
People stare in disbelief
Lost in admiration as I nibble on a leaf
A very noted vegetarian
I wouldn't even eat horseradish, in case I upset the horses.
I stay away from deviled ham on principle
I wouldn't eat roast duckling if I could
Willpower has made me invincible
My word
Those sausages look good
Where's my dinner gone?
They've done it again.
Come on. Own up. Who's got it this time? Who's got my dinner?
It's bad enough to have to eat this muck in the first place.
Just 'cause I eat this instead of eating them, they think they can take advantage of me.
You've no idea what I put up with on their account.
I eat every flowering shrub there is except for gorse
Sometimes I get luxuries like beetroot leaves, of course
My life's much the same as that of any English horse
Why should I be a vegetarian
Turnip pie and peanuts
That's the sort of filth I eat
Any sort of rubbish that is wholesome and discreet
Why don't I admit that my hypocrisy's complete
If I should live to be a centenarian
Become our most adored humanitarian
I'll never make a decent vegetarian
I'm a cheat, I love meat
I'm a cheat, yes, I am
I love red-blooded juicy chunks of meat
Legs of lamb, sides of beef
And chops and steaks and veal and pork, of course
-  My favorite meal
And then I hear poor Gub-Gub squeal
Oh, me, oh, my
A reluctant but sincere
Vegetarian
Am I
So, you see, Stubbins, being an animal doctor has its problems.
For one thing, you don't get paid anything, at least not in money.
You get bones or nuts or worms... or whatever the particular animal's currency happens to be.
And secondly, most of the animals who come here as patients like it so much, they stay here permanently.
It's hardly what you'd call a profit-making enterprise.
But who looks after the animals?
They look after themselves, for the most part.
Animals are much better at that than human beings.
And how did you become a veteran?
No, Stubbins, the word is "veterinarian."
But say "animal doctor."
It's less pretentious.
It all happened rather suddenly, actually.
My entire life changed in one day, didn't it, Matthew?
It was my sister, Sarah, who started it all.
Sarah.
Oh!
Did you know that an ant has more intelligence than a hippopotamus?
And that a grasshopper... in relation to his size... has more power in his hind legs than a kangaroo?
Absolutely fascinating.
There's no doubt about it. Animals are much more interesting than people.
Good heavens, Sarah.
What on Earth are you doing down there?
There are pigeons in the linen cupboard.
- Oh, yes, I thought it would be warmer for them.
- You knew?
Yes, I put them there. It gets so terribly chilly on the roof at night.
And two tortoises in the guest room.
That's where they are.
I wondered where they got to.
- And white mice in your chest of drawers.
- That's right.
And the grass snakes are in the roll top desk under the envelopes.
Grass snakes?
John Dolittle, if those animals aren't out of this house by tonight...
Oh, dear!
Nine o'clock precisely.
That will be Lady Petherington.
I wonder what she's found wrong with herself today.
All right, Sarah.
Show her in, please.
I mean it, John.
I shall leave.
Those animals, they're destroying your practice.
You won't have a decent patient left soon.
Not unless you answer the door.
I don't understand the things that go on around this house with those animals.
And we'll probably never see the vicar's wife again... after giving her that glass of milk with a frog in it.
I really don't know what you expect me to do.
Oh, good morning,
Lady Petherington.
Are we feeling better today?
We're no better for being left to freeze to death on Doctor's front doorsteps.
Oh.
Dr. Dolittle, oh, it's my nerves.
You must do something for them instantly.
Oh, you'll never guess what happened.
It's quite the worst experience of my life.
Uh, won't you come in,
Lady Petherington?
I was giving this dinner party last night... up at the Grange for the Duke of St. Albans.
Fifty guests. The most embarrassing moment of my entire life.
A mouse ran across the table.
Oh, I thought I'd die.
I may still.
Can you imagine? A mouse.
Do you know who was there, hmm?
Well, of course, everybody.
The humiliation.
Crown Prince Angelicus of Brandenberg.
He's so well-bred, he doesn't even know what a mouse is.
Fainted dead away.
I haven't slept all night.
Of course, I discharged my entire staff, especially the gardeners.
I'll be struck from the social directory.
A mouse. Hmph.
- Vicar, what a surprise!
- Bless me.
How is your frog?
I mean, your wife.
Oh, the less said about her the better.
I mean, that incident.
Most unfor... for... for... fortunate.
Bless me.
Miss Dolittle, it's my hay fever.
The Bishop of Glastonbury is attending my sermon this evening,
- and it's most important, you understand.
- Of course.
- But my hay... hay...
Oh! Oh! Oh!
But... But... Oh!
- Oh!
- Sir Rupert, I'm so sorry!
Where in the heavens does that woman think she's going?
- Get out of my way, Vicar!
Oh!
Ow!
Oh!
Oh!
Ow!
Oh, let me out of this madhouse!
- Oh! Oh!
- Sir Rupert, I'm so sorry!
Ow!
John!
Yes, Sarah?
I shall give you just five minutes to make up your mind.
Either you get rid of every hideous bird, beast and reptile... in this ridiculous menagerie immediately,
- or I am leaving... today!
- But...
- Five minutes.
- Sarah, I can't just...
Oh, yes, you can just.
I don't think five minutes is very long.
Anybody home?
Oh, come in, Matthew.
Well, l-I didn't know you was having a party.
What are we celebrating?
You know, Matthew, today I made a great discovery.
Oh? What was that then?
I'm a terrible doctor.
I'm probably the worst doctor in the world.
Good for you.
I like a man who knows his worth.
I have absolutely no interest in the health and welfare of my patients.
I can't begin to communicate with them.
I don't even want to communicate with them.
I've come to the conclusion that, with the possible exception of yourself,
I have nothing in common with the human race.
You know, the trouble with you,
John Dolittle, is you prefer animals to people.
But animals are so much more fun than people.
Then be an animal doctor.
- What was that?
- I said, "Be an animal doctor."
Animal doctor?
You know more about animals than anybody I've ever met.
I could get every sick animal within miles to come to you.
Aye, so could I.
At least all the dogs and cats.
All the rich ones, that is.
The Pekes and the poodles.
I could slip a little something into their meat.
Shh, Matthew.
What do you mean?
I mean, there isn't one good animal doctor in the west of England.
Farmer Green's cow was saying only the other day... she just will not have another calf until she gets a decent doctor.
You mean, you spoke to her?
At the Animals' Welfare League.
We meet every Wednesday.
She's chair-cow.
You mean, animals actually talk to one another?
Well, of course, we can.
Do you think we're all dumb?
L... No, no.
I knew parrots could talk.
Parrots are the finest linguists in the animal kingdom.
I speak over 2,000 languages, including dodo and unicorn.
- Unicorn?
- I have a classical education.
Polynesia, could I learn to talk to animals?
I don't see why not.
You're quite intelligent.
Oh, thank you.
If I succeeded, I could become... the greatest animal doctor in the world.
Oh, no question.
Mind you, it isn't easy.
I'm the only parrot in the world... who actually understands what she's talking about.
Well, if you can do it,
I don't see why I shouldn't.
I like your attitude.
Why have I never thought of this before?
Polynesia, I want you to teach me everything you know.
What, 2,000 languages?
Certainly. We'll start at 8:00 tomorrow morning.
But it took me over a hundred years.
Then we'll start at 7:00.
There's not a moment to lose.
Matthew, think what it would mean...
If I could talk to the animals
Just imagine it
Chatting to a chimp in chimpanzee
Imagine talking to a tiger
Chatting to a cheetah
What a neat achievement that would be
If we could talk to the animals
Learn their languages
Maybe take an animal degree
I'd study elephant and eagle buffalo and beagle
Alligator, guinea pig and flea
I would converse in polar bear and python
And I would curse in fluent kangaroo
If people asked me
Can you speak rhinoceros
I'd say, of course-eros
Can't you
If I conferred with our furry friends
Man-to-animal
Think of the amazing repartee
If I could walk with the animals
Talk with the animals
Grunt and squeak and squawk with the animals
And they could talk to me
If I consulted with quadrupeds
Think what fun we'd have
Asking over crocodiles for tea
Or maybe lunch with two or three lions
Walruses or sea lions
What a lovely place the world would be
If I spoke slang to orangutans
The advantages any fool on Earth could plainly see
Discussing Eastern art and dramas
With intellectual llamas
That's a big step forward
You'll agree
I'd learn to speak in antelope and turtle
My Pekingese would be extremely good
If I were asked to sing in hippopotamus
I'd say, why not-amus and would
If I could parley with pachyderms
It's a fairy tale worthy of Hans Andersen or Grimm
A man who walks with the animals
Talks with the animals
Grunts and squeaks and squawks with the animals
This is the most exciting thing that's ever happened to me, Polynesia.
I can't wait to start.
Just the very thing.
For instance, Polynesia, how would I say...
"good morning" to our friend there?
In pig talk, I mean.
That's simple.
- Was that it?
- Why, yes.
It's remarkable.
What was all the leg-shaking business?
That's part of "good morning."
Most animal languages are a mixture of sounds and movements.
A short snort means "good."
Shaking the leg means "morning."
And you... And you just put the two together?
That's right.
Didn't answer me.
No, that's your right leg.
That means "good night."
Oh.
She answered.
Did you see that? She answered.
All I went was...
Did it again.
Good heavens. I speak pig.
Where are we going?
I want to say good morning to every animal in Puddleby.
It's incredible.
It's impossible.
But it's true.
A man can talk to the animals
It's a miracle
In a year from now I guarantee
I'll be the marvel of the mammals
Playing chess with camels
No more just a boring old M.D.
I'll study every living creature's language
So I can speak to all of them on sight
If friends say
Can he talk in crab or pelican
You'll say, like helican and you'll be right
And if you just stop to think a bit
There's no doubt of it
I shall win a place in history
For I can walk with the animals
Talk with the animals
Grunt and squeak and squawk with the animals
And they can squeak and squawk
And speak and talk
To me
Needless to say, Stubbins,
I've neither seen nor spoken... to dear sister, Sarah, from that day to this.
But I do have the consolation of being able to speak 498 animal languages.
Any one of which is more fun than talking to Sarah.
Four hundred and ninety-eight?
With goldfish, it will be 499.
When you get to 500, Doctor, we ought to have a party.
We must.
You'll need more than languages before we can search for the great pink sea snail.
Voyages cost money, you know.
Mm, quite.
Now, gentlemen, if you'll forgive me, animals are earlier risers than human beings, and I've got to be up at 5:30 to open the clinic.
Good heavens.
You can't go home in that.
Matthew, you can make up a bed here, if you don't mind Gub-Gub snoring.
Stubbins can sleep on the sofa in the library.
Polynesia will go over to your house and tell your parents you're all right.
Good night.
- Good night.
- Good night.
He's a genius.
Uh-hum.
I think you're next.
What did you tell her?
To take two of these pills three times a day after meals.
Polynesia, remember that lady owes us a gallon of milk.
- All right, Doctor.
- Now, what next?
This mouse. He has a bent tail.
Oh, it's you again.
Well, that's the third time this week.
What's that machine?
It's a whisker and tail straightener.
My own invention.
These field mice are always getting caught in General Bellowes' pantry... up at the Grange.
Being a military man, he has a regular defense system of mousetraps, and they're all having very narrow escapes, like this one.
There we are.
That should do it. Good as new.
There.
But, uh, keep away from General Bellowes' pantry.
Next.
Good morning, Sheila.
On the desk, please, Stubbins.
Yes, sir.
- Oh, I see.
- What's the matter?
Apparently one of her children have got flat feet.
This one? Yes.
Very dangerous in hunting season.
Can't run fast enough.
I'll work out some form of exercise.
Bum-bum. Bum-bum.
Bum-bum. Something like that.
Anyhow, we'd better see our other patients first.
I can get on with this later.
Good boy, Jip.
Uh-oh.
Ah, Toggle.
Oh, yes, of course.
Toggle's getting a bit shortsighted in his old age.
There now.
We'll just, uh, test these.
Now, I'm sure this will be better than the last time.
Good Lord. That's excellent.
Polynesia, remember
Toggle owes me a free ride... next time I have to go to Plymouth or Penzance.
Yes, Doctor.
What the devil! Emma, I'll murder him if I lay my hands on him!
- That's Bellowes' voice.
- Damn it! What's the matter?
Out of my way!
Out of my way!
Get out of my way!
Get out of my way!
There he is.
We've caught him red-handed.
- Emma, you're a witness.
- A witness to what?
The most flagrant display of organized animal stealing... in the history of Puddleby crime.
Organized? I beg...
I am a doctor, sir.
You are a horse thief, sir.
That is my plow horse.
It's no good your trying to disguise him.
He's wearing glasses because he's shortsighted.
I'd recognize him anywhere.
Take them off. At once, sir.
Shortsighted. That won't sound very convincing in front of the magistrate.
- Magistrate?
- I'm prosecuting, and I don't fancy your chances in court.
I'm the magistrate, and if I weren't late for my foxhunt,
I'd report you for cruelty to animals.
Don't you dare lay a finger on her.
- She's one of my patients.
- One of your what?
She's been chased by your wretched foxhounds three times in two weeks.
You've already murdered her husband.
If anything happened to her, these babies are going to be orphans.
It's all right, Sheila.
I won't let him hurt you.
I've never heard... Sheila?
Just the sight of you is enough to give her a heart attack.
Look at her.
She's a complete nervous wreck.
She'll be more than that by the time I'm finished with her!
- You'll never catch her.
- Tallyho!
There are times when the English are rather tiresome.
Bellowes, no!
Out of my way!
- Out of my way! Out of my way!
- Oh, well.
"Never catch her," eh?
What do you think this is?
My horse!
- Where did they come from?
- North America.
We formed an Anglo-American
Fox Protection Society.
Purely volunteer, of course.
Fox Protection Society?
Yes. During the hunting season, a skunk will always run with a fox.
The idea is to put the hounds off the scent.
I never dreamt it would work so well.
- How dare you!
- I beg your pardon?
- General Bellowes...
- He certainly does.
- Is my uncle.
- I'm sorry.
- Is that an apology?
- I'm sorry he's your uncle.
And I'm sorry I'm his niece.
- It must be terrible.
- What do you mean?
Having a name like Bellowes.
- My name is Emma Fairfax.
- Oh, that's a bit better.
What I meant was that if I were his nephew instead of his niece...
If you were his nephew, you'd hardly be called Emma Fairfax.
- If I were a man...
- Fred Fairfax?
I have never in my entire experience... known anyone treat people as appallingly as you do.
I don't treat people, madam.
I treat animals.
You treat people like animals too.
And I have nothing but contempt for people whose idea of pleasure... is to take a defenseless animal and make a social event out of a ritual killing.
- That's it, John Dolittle. You tell her.
- Matthew, I am telling her.
- You make it sound...
- Furthermore...
- Don't keep interrupting me!
- I'm sorry. What did you wish to say?
Oh, I've forgotten!
Very well. Furthermore, I would deem it a favor if in the future... you and your bloodthirsty relatives... would avoid coming here and upsetting the animals.
In any case, I find it hard to believe that a grown man... can waste his entire life playing with animals in the first place.
And I, madam, find it equally hard to believe... that a grown woman could spend her entire life doing absolutely nothing.
You got to admit that for someone called Fred, she's a fair-looking fellow.
If I were a man
I'd scratch his eyes out
I'd tear his hair out by the roots
And kick his shins in with my boots
And I would bite his hand as only I can
If only I could be a man
A great man would not hesitate
To put Dr. Dolittle to death
Attila the Hun
To name only one
Would chuckle at his dying breath
It seems a man can be as rude as he likes
Crude as he likes
Lewd as he likes too
But a girl must be discreet as she can
Sweet as she can
Neat as she can too
But that's not the life
That I want to lead
Normal and formal as homespun tweed
I need the freedom to go
Where I please
But where
Do I please
I don't know
That's the trouble
I don't know
Here I stand at the crossroads of life
Childhood behind me
The future to come
And alone
Nothing planned at the crossroads of life
But life will find me
More grateful than some
It has known
Grateful to see
All the wonderful things I see
Grateful to be
What life expects me to be
So I stand at the crossroads of life
This way or that way
Well, which shall I go
Towards the left or the right
Towards the day or the night
Towards the dark or the light
Only my heart can know
Only my heart
Can know
- What is it?
- Ha. I don't know, Doctor.
It just arrived for ya.
- It's making funny noises.
- Extraordinary-looking thing.
- It's from Tibet.
It's probably that pink sea snail you was lookin' for.
No, it's not big enough for that.
What do you suppose it is?
Well, we could always open it and find out.
Oh, yes. What a good idea.
Ah. Oh, look, it's a llama.
Come on, boy. Come on, boy.
I think he's nervous. Open up the other end and give him a push, Matthew.
Here.
There's another one at this end.
There's two of them.
Two llamas? How thoughtful of somebody.
People are awfully nice.
- What are you going to do with them?
- We could make ourselves... a couple of nice overcoats for a start.
Come on, boy. Come on, boy.
This way, lad. Come on. Come on.
That's a good fella.
I don't believe it. It can't be.
- It is! It is!
- What? What? What?
It's a pushmi-pullyu.
- Look.
- Holy O'Reilly. Forgive me.
I'll never touch another drop.
Stubbins, pat the other end.
They're very timid.
This is without doubt the first one that's ever been captured.
If I had a head at each end,
I'd take a bit of catchin' too.
- What's he saying, Doctor?
- It's rather difficult to understand.
It's a camel dialect with rather a thick accent.
- A message? Oh, a message for me.
- Is this it?
Ah, yes, it's from Long Arrow.
I should have guessed.
Who's he when he's at home?
The greatest naturalist in the world and a very old friend.
- He's a Red Indian gentleman.
- With a name like Long Arrow,
I didn't think he was Irish.
- What's all them drawings, Doctor?
- Picture writing.
It's the only way we can communicate.
You see, this means the pushmi-pullyu is a gift.
The open hand, you see?
For me. That's me.
From his friend, Long Arrow.
To make money to take a ship... to search for great pink sea snail.
Signed Long Arrow.
Oh, that's marvelous.
But tell me, Doctor, how do you make money with a pushmi-pullyu?
I thought it was obvious. Stubbins, what would you do if you had two heads?
- I'd join a circus, sir.
- Exactly.
Excuse me. I'm looking for the proprietor.
You've found him. Albert Blossom.
- Splendid. How do you do?
My name's Dolittle.
- I'm not interested.
- I thought you might like to see a rather unusual...
- No, I wouldn't.
It's probably something you haven't seen before.
I've seen everything before.
- Then you aren't interested?
- That's right. I'm not interested.
Come along, Matthew.
- Sorry to have troubled you. Good day.
- Good day.
- It's a trick.
- No, it's no trick.
Why... But... I've never seen anything like it.
- Neither has anybody else.
- Hey, whoa! I say, come here!
Just a minute.
Hey, hey! I mean, l-I've never seen anything like it.
I mean, I've seen the world
I've been around
I can tell you stories that would quite astound you
I'm not a fool
I went to school
I've been from
Liverpool to Istanbul
Istanbul, I'm no fool
And anyone will tell you that
I'm sharper than a knife
But I've never seen anything like it in my life
- It's a pushmi-pullyu.
- Is it?
Well, I've never seen anything like it
I've never seen anything like it
I've never seen anything like it in my life
- It's the rarest animal on Earth.
- It certainly is!
Hey, hold up a moment. Hey!
I mean, I know the game
I've seen them all
I could tell you stories that would quite enthrall you
I know me job
Pleasin' the mob
I give 'em what they want for just two bob
Just two bob
Well, that's my job
But this is so fantastic
I can't wait to tell the wife
Gertie, you've never seen anything like it in your life
Come on out!
You've never seen anything like it
I've never seen anything like it
You've never seen anything like it in your life
It's a bicranium, madam.
Arthur! Charlie! Joe!
Come and have a look at this!
Beverly, get Joe!
I thought I'd seen every wonder in the world
I've seen the Colosseum in Rome and the Acropolis
I've made the biggest blunder in the world
'Cause I've never seen anything quite like this
Now look what you've done!
You've frightened him!
Hey, come back! Come back!
I'm down to earth
I'll tell you straight
I could tell you stories that would fascinate you
I know the trade
I know the tricks
I once bought an elephant for two pound six
Two pound six
Taught it tricks
But for your pushmi-pullyu
I'd pay three pounds
Four pounds!
Five!
'Cause I've never seen anything like it that's alive
I tell you what.
I'd even pay for it in cash.
Five? That wasn't exactly what we had in mind.
Because, you see, pushmi-pullyus are remarkable creatures
Of all God's animals they're the cleverest
They develop these remarkable features running up and down Mount Everest
- No!
- Yes! Absolutely true.
Runnin' up and down
Mount Everest?
Exactly. You see...
Running up and down the mountain gives them very nimble feet
Put them on the right rope
They could walk a tightrope
That should give the audience a rare old treat
And this extreme agility begets a rare ability
Shared only with the mountain goats of France
The pushmi-pullyu loves to dance
I'll give you anything you want.
- The terms are quite simple.
- Anything you want!
- Four-week engagement.
- Right!
- Share all profits equally.
- Right.
Two performances a day.
Oh, uh, no, uh, four performances a day.
Just a minute.
We have a problem.
Well, what do they want?
Three shows a day.
And four on Saturday?
They agree.
Done!
La, la-la, la
La, la, la, la, la
- My dear Dolittle!
- Oh, I'm awfully sorry.
You've never seen anything like it!
I've never seen anything like it.
Dolittle, me.
Thank you.
- Me.
- No, Dolittle.
I mean, you're not a fool
Neither am I
I could tell you stories that would stultify you
Open your eyes
What do you see
This thing's a miracle for you and me
Guarantee
I agree
Within a meager month
I've seen my wildest dreams come true
'Cause I've never seen anything like it nor have you
Oh, I've never seen anything like it
Never seen anything like it
I've never seen anything like it
In all my
Life
What's the matter with you, Sophie?
Come on, Sophie. Catch it.
Try again, Sophie.
Come on, Sophie.
- That's yours.
- Oh, thanks.
Right, well,
I'm off to the bank.
Ah, here we are now. "Seals are notoriously sentimental creatures.
Prolonged separation from those they love can result... in complete lack of interest in their usual activities."
That would explain why Sophie keeps dropping things in her act.
It isn't like her.
I'm sure she's pining for some reason.
I must go and have a chat with her.
This fellow obviously knows what he's talking about.
- Who wrote the book, Doctor?
- Uh, oh, I did.
- Hmm.
- Just a moment!
I have something to say to you,
- Mr. Dolittle.
- Doctor.
Doctor?
I've heard of some hypocrites in my time, but you are contemptible!
All that sanctimonious claptrap about protecting defenseless creatures, and here you are an animal trainer in a cheap circus!
Exhibiting freaks!
Come, lad. Why don't you go and make some cocoa?
- I don't want any cocoa, do you?
- I'd love some, lad. Yes. Off you go.
Hello, Fred.
He is... He's very rude.
Who, the doctor?
Oh, no, not at all. He's a darlin' man.
Did you hear what he said about my uncle?
Oh, that, yeah, well, he's a darlin' man, but he's very rude.
Of course, I wouldn't mind so much except everything he said was true.
You should never believe anybody who goes around tellin' the truth.
They're not to be trusted.
Ya have to do it both ends.
Otherwise it gets jealous.
He was too ashamed to say anything just now, of course.
- Too nice.
- Nice?
He's the kindest man on God's Earth, Fred.
He understands animals better than you and me will ever understand anythin'.
Well, I certainly don't understand him.
Ah, sure, now.
He's one of the beautiful people.
And I'm sure now he's one of the horrible people.
You're wrong, sweetheart.
I can't explain what it is that he is
But he is what he is for a very good reason
I can't explain why he does what he does
But he does what he does
'cause his heart is pure
Of that much
I am sure
I'm sure as I told young Tom the other day
He lives in a world of fantasy
And that is a world
I plan to see, fantasy
Can't you see
The world is full of beautiful things
Butterfly wings
Fairy tale kings
And each new day undoubtedly brings
Still more beautiful things
The world abounds with many delights
Magical sights
Fanciful flights
And those who dream on beautiful nights
Dream of beautiful things
Beautiful days for sunshine lazin'
Beautiful skies and shores
Beautiful days when I can gaze
In beautiful eyes
Like yours
Our lives tick by like a pendulum swings
Poor little things
Puppets on strings
But life is full
Of beautiful things
Beautiful people
Too
Beautiful people
Like
You
I see. I see.
I'm sorry. Hmm.
Ah, cocoa.
Come in, gentlemen.
You know Sophie, don't you?
Oh, yes, of course you do.
It seems we have a problem on our hands.
Sophie's just been telling me how much she misses her husband.
That's why she couldn't concentrate on her performance, just as I thought.
- Where is her husband?
- The North Pole. That's the problem.
They were on their way there when Sophie was captured.
If she doesn't get back to him, she feels she's going to go completely to pieces.
What do you want us to do?
Go to the North Pole?
Unfortunately, there isn't time, but it's very pleasant up there.
But the North Pole hasn't been discovered yet.
Not officially.
I'd never say anything about it.
I promised the polar bears I wouldn't.
Anyway, that's beside the point.
What we've got to do is to get Sophie back to her husband.
Now, if I could get her to the Bristol Channel, she could swim it in about a week.
You go along there, around that bit, then straight on and then slightly to the left.
Oh, that's great, but how does she get to the Bristol Channel?
- Well, she'd have to escape.
- Escape? A seal?
I can hardly go to Blossom and say she wanted to go to the North Pole to see her husband.
He wouldn't believe a word.
- You know something?
- What?
- She's gonna have to escape.
- Tonight.
Shh. Shh.
- Is everything all right, sir?
- It's my grandmother.
She's not very well.
I'm taking her to Bristol.
- Can you smell fish?
- Fish?
It's Granny.
She's on a special diet.
Very wise, sir.
Are you all right, dear?
Enjoying the trip?
Oh, that's good.
Whoa! Whoa!
What's the delay?
What's going on there?
Jack Fitch, the highwayman, has been seen on this road.
We have to search all coaches.
Help yourself.
You'll find no surprise in here.
All right, driver.
All right, get up.
All right, go on.
Come back here, Nelly!
Nelly, come back here!
Where are you going?
Where are you going, Nelly?
Come on back!
Come back here, I tell ya!
Well, here we are. Sorry it was such an uncomfortable journey, but it was really the only way.
There, there, there, Sophie.
Don't get upset.
I can't bear females who cry.
Shh. Don't look at me like that, Sophie, or I'll get upset too.
Dear Sophie, you understand so much, don't you?
When I look in your eyes
I see the wisdom of the world in your eyes
I see the sadness of a thousand good-byes
When I look in your eyes
Shh, shh.
And it is no surprise
To see the softness of the moon in your eyes
The gentle sparkle of the stars in the skies
When I look in your eyes
In your eyes I see the deepness of the sea
I see the deepness
Of the love, the love
I feel you feel for me
Autumn comes, summer dies
I see the passing of the years in your eyes
And when we part, there will be no tears, no good-byes
I'll just look into your eyes
Dear Sophie
Those eyes so wise
So warm, so real
Isn't it a pity you're a seal
Well, she's on her way.
- What did you throw her in for?
- She wanted to go back to her husband.
No, you don't understand at all.
She wasn't a woman. She was a seal.
- A seal?
- Yes.
Dressed in a bonnet and shawl?
That's right. Yes. I'd sort of borrowed it from this lady in the tavern.
The bonnet had a little brown ribbon through...
Never mind about the brown ribbons.
You then took the seal to Bristol in a stagecoach... and upon arrival promptly threw her over a cliff.
Exactly.
May one ask why?
Uh, certainly. Um, she wanted to go to the North Pole to see her husband.
- Her husband?
- Yes.
What makes you think this seal wanted to go to the North Pole?
- Well, she told me.
- She told you?
Yes, we discussed it in great detail.
Are you in the habit of talking to animals?
Yes, I am.
I do it all the time.
I thought perhaps you did.
With all due respect to
Your Worship, I think I detect a note of skepticism in the court.
I would, therefore, like an opportunity... to prove the point by talking to any animal you care to nominate.
Very well then.
My dog Rufus is outside. Bring him in!
Oh, that's very kind of you.
This way, please.
Oh, thank you very much.
Yes, Rufus will be only too happy to answer any questions you care to ask.
Oh, I think we can dispense with that formality.
Uh, ask him what I had for dinner last night.
Very well.
Did he?
Well, really? Did he?
Good Lord. Well, well.
Did he really?
Well, well, well.
What did he say?
I'm grateful that Your Worship acknowledges the fact that the dog was talking.
For dinner last night,
Your Lordship enjoyed the following:
Two helpings of boiled trout, four helpings of roast pheasant, roast potatoes, brussels sprouts and gravy,
Followed by six large portions of blackberry pie with whipped cream.
It's not true! I only had five helpings of blackberry pie!
Your Lordship also drank a great deal of wine and brandy... and later in the evening sang noisy songs with your friends about a woman from Swansea...
That's enough!
The court is adjourned until tomorrow morning, pending inquiries about the bonnet and shawl stolen from the tavern in question.
Hmm. Thank you.
Well, by my calculation, the trial will be over by 11:00 tomorrow morning.
Polynesia, how much did we earn from the circus?
206 pounds, seven and fourpence, halfpenny.
Ah, it's more than enough.
I see no reason why we shouldn't set out to find the pink sea snail right away.
Matthew, go to the house and pick up my clothes.
Have the boat ready to sail by 12:00.
We'll catch the noontide or whatever it's called.
We haven't got a crew, so we'll have to make due with you and Stubbins and the animals.
I can come too?
If your parents say so and you know how to tie a knot.
Hear that? We're going to help the doctor find the pink sea snail.
I should wait until you see his boat before you get too excited.
It isn't by chance it's called the Flounder.
No sailor in his right mind would touch it.
I'm not asking a sailor in his right mind. I was asking you.
What do you say?
I say that for a man who's about to be hanged for murder... to be gettin' ready to go on a pleasure cruise shows a very nice outlook.
- Fred!
- To what do we owe this, uh, pleasure?
- I've brought dinner.
- Dinner?
- Yes, for Matthew and Tommy.
- Oh.
Set it down there, Hubert.
Steak and kidney pie and oxtail and roast beef.
- Would you like some?
- Uh, no.
Oh, come on, Doctor.
Ya haven't had a bite all day.
- No, thank you.
- He's a vegetarian.
Oh, no!
It, uh, seems a pity to waste it.
It's all right, Matthew.
Um, carry on.
I'm sorry, Doctor.
Come on, Tom.
Doctor?
Um, Rufus was right.
He did have six helpings of blackberry pie.
Thank you.
Oh, thank you, Chee-Chee.
It seems that a bonnet and shawl were, in fact, removed... from the tavern in question on the day in question.
The lady who owns them, for reasons best known to herself, has no wish to prosecute.
You are, therefore, acquitted of the charge of murder.
Thank you very much.
However, your performance in this courtroom in the past two days... has left little doubt in the minds of my distinguished colleagues and myself... that your lunatic activities with animals infringe upon the public safety... and are not to be tolerated.
Happily, Her Majesty's farseeing benevolence provides a sanctuary for sad people like you... who think they can talk to animals and want to treat them like human beings.
Therefore, it is the judgment of this court... that you be committed indefinitely to an asylum for the insane.
Have you anything to say?
I do not understand the human race
It has so little love for creatures
With a different face
Treating animals like people is no madness or disgrace
I do not understand the human race
I wonder why do we treat animals like animals
Animals treat us so very well
The devoted way they serve us and protect us when we're nervous
Oh, they really don't deserve us
All we give them is hell
Tell me how else man repays them
Do we ever think to praise them, no, we don't
And this dismays them
You can tell
We are riddled with ingratitude
We give no love or latitude
In every way our attitude is well, like animals
No, no. That's not what I mean. I mean...
Why do we treat animals like animals
How can people be so inhumane
Cows and chickens work to feed us
Dogs and horses show they need us
And though cats don't always heed us their affection is plain
What do we do, we neglect them
We do nothing to protect them
We reject them
Don't expect them to complain
We ignore them or we beat them
When we're hungry then we eat them
It's appalling how we treat them, it's insane
Like animals
We humiliate and murder and confine them
We create their wretched status
Then we use it to malign them
I mean, why should we say
Treat him like a dog
Why should we say
Working like a horse
Why should we say
Eating like a hog
When what we mean is
Eating like a man
Don't we, of course
A man of ill repute is called a weasel or a rat
A woman you dislike becomes a vixen or a cat
A family that is blessed with healthy reproductive habits
Occasions the remark, well, you know them, they breed like rabbits
He's as stubborn as a mule
He's as stupid as an ox
He's as slimy as a snake
He's as crafty as a fox
Remarks like that really get my goat
Why don't we say
Noble as a frog
Or why can't we say
Wealthy as a hen
True, we say
Devoted as a dog
What we should say is
Chic as a giraffe
Pretty as a pig, eh
That will be the big day, won't it
But when, but when
But when, when will we stop treating them like animals
Is the human race entirely mad
Women see a baby goatskin or a lambskin or a stoatskin
And to them it's just a coatskin
Oh, it's terribly sad
When you dress in suede or leather or some fancy fur or feather
Do you stop and wonder whether for a fad
You have killed some beast or other
That you're wearing someone's brother
Or perhaps it's someone's mother in which you're clad
Like animals
Like animals
Like animals
Well, it's true
We do not live in a zoo
But man is an animal too
So why can't you
Like me
Like animals
Animals
Now, the prison faces the road here.
So what we do is we tie the ropes from the bars of the cell to the elephant, and he pulls the whole wall off.
How can you go on the voyage if the doctor's still in prison?
We can't. That's why Matthew's got this marvelous plan to get him out.
Then this second elephant... he's bigger than the first elephant...
All the doctor has to do is step through the hole in the wall onto his back.
- You'll never get away with this.
- Listen, here's the clever part.
He slides down the elephant's trunk onto a waitin' rhinoceros and away they go!
Just the three of you are going off on this boat?
Oh, no. Chee-Chee, Polynesia and Jip are coming too.
Then there's these six tigers, you see, to stop anyone followin'.
To look for a pink sea snail?
They'll be standing on the other side of the road while I'm settin' off the dynamite.
- Dynamite?
- Oh, sure.
If we blow up the road, they'll have to go all the way around the town to get to the harbor, which gives me time to nip back here... and blow up the bridge while you're gettin' on the boat.
That's the beauty of this whole plan... its simplicity.
- Are they really going to keep the doctor in prison?
- Oh, no, no.
They're moving him across to the loony bin at 12:00.
- Today?
- Aye.
I've also an idea.
You get the boat ready.
Leave the doctor to me.
We sail at 12:00. Avast now.
Aye, aye, sir.
We're a fine bunch, takin' orders from a parrot.
Matthew, how did you enjoy the food I brought you in the prison the other night?
'Twas the best meal
I ever had in me life.
They say that prison food is terrible.
I won't hear a word against it.
I was thinking.
Wouldn't it be nice if you were to have those kind of meals on your voyage?
Oh, true now.
It would be marvelous.
The only way we could do that is if you was to...
If we was to, uh...
Ah!
I'll tell you one thing, Fred.
I only hope there's no stowaways on that boat.
Because if there was,
I wouldn't know where to look for them.
Anyway, once we're out at sea with an escaped convict, there's no turnin' back.
Oh, Matthew!
I love you!
Who would have thought that one little kiss
Soft and sweet from the lips of a lovely girl
Would to change my life
But by my life
It will
After today nothing will be the same again
After today I'll make my claim to fame and then
The grass will be greener
And the air will be cleaner
And my life be serener
Than heaven knows when
Heaven knows when
After today I shall have bid my fears good-bye
After today I shall have no more tears
To cry
I'll learn to live with laughter to stay
After
Today
After today nothing will be the way it was
After today I'll say
Oh, what a day it was
My heart will be lighter
And my smile will be brighter
And I'll be twice the fighter
That ever I was
Clever because
After today I shall have bid my fears farewell
After today I shall have no more tears
To quell
I'll learn to live with laughter
To stay
After the tears comes the laughter
After today
Chee-Chee.
Run! Run!
Stop!
Don't follow the doctor!
Don't obey! Don't obey!
Right!
Come on! This way!
Don't sit down!
- Get up!
- After them!
Go after him!
This way. Come on. After him. This way.
- This way! No, this way!
- Ta-ta.
- Stop them!
- Stop them! Stop them!
It's all right, Doctor.
You can come out now.
- There's not a policeman in sight.
- Oh, thank you, Matthew.
Makes a very good little reading room, this. I must use it more often.
Now, let's see where we are.
Ah, I see.
He says there's a faint smell of garlic coming from the southeast.
- What does that mean?
- It means we're about ten miles off the coast of France.
I've got about the best navigational system on the high seas today.
Jip's got this incredible sense of smell, and Polynesia gets marvelous weather reports from the passing birds and fishes.
- Everything all right at the house?
- Yes, Doctor.
Good. Keep an eye on everything and don't bump into anything like Ireland.
Aye, aye, Doctor.
- A very well organized escape.
Thank you.
- Don't mention it.
I doubt if there's a ship afloat with flowers like these.
Look at these geraniums.
Absolutely glorious.
Have you seen my azaleas on the starboard side?
- No, sir, I can't say as I have.
- They're doing wonderfully.
How are you enjoying life on the rolling deep?
If the good Lord meant us to take to water, He'd have given us flippers.
No, Stubbins, move your mouth about more.
You must reread my essay on basic chimpanzee, page one.
I must cut these roses back.
There's so much to do on a ship.
What a marvelous smell, Matthew.
What have you been cooking?
I'm absolutely starving.
Will this do?
Do come on while it's still hot.
What are you doing here?
I thought someone capable ought to look after Tommy on the voyage.
Stubbins is perfectly capable of looking after himself.
I must turn the ship around and go straight back to Puddleby... uh, well, immediately after lunch.
They'll, uh... They'll put ya inside if you go back, Doctor.
Oh, yes, that is a point.
What are we going to do with her if she stays?
You make me sound like a stray cat.
A cat would be most welcome.
Don't worry. It's vegetarian.
- It's delicious.
- It's marvelous.
Mmm. What is it?
- Algue marine en croute.
- Oh, yes.
- What's that in English?
- Seaweed pie.
Mmm! It's really rather good.
- Well, where are we going?
- To hunt for the great pink sea snail.
And where do you expect to find it?
I haven't the faintest idea.
But as one place is as good as another, it's high time we decided.
- Otherwise, when we get there, we won't know we've arrived.
- Good thinking.
- Thank you.
- Are your voyages always as well planned as this?
When possible. Unfortunately, one doesn't always have time to go into minute details.
- Such as knowing where you're going?
- That sort of thing.
But then how do you decide?
We play a little game I invented.
One of us opens the atlas at random, sticks a pin in the open page.
Wherever it lands, that's where we go.
- You can't be serious.
- I'm very serious.
That is the most ridiculous thing
I have ever heard of.
You could end up in all sorts of terrible places.
That's absolutely true.
I remember going to the Sahara Desert four times in succession... before I realized Chee-Chee had stuck down all the other pages of the atlas with jam.
Marvelous trips. Lots of sand.
But that is exactly what I mean.
It's all right now. I cleaned all the jam off. Little bit there.
How you can sit there and say what you're saying I just don't know.
I must admit the Sahara is one place
I'm praying we just won't go.
You know, that's absolutely typical of a woman.
There are so many fabulous faraway places to see
She makes one seaweed pie and goes mad.
Such as Mexico, Sweden
Hawaii, Japan and Capri
Who does she think she is?
There's so many exciting and wonderful places
Much more inviting than desert oases
Pleasant as home is it isn't what Rome is
So why stay there
When there are so many fabulous faraway places to see
As though the seaweed pie was all that marvelous.
Why should Spain and Tahiti and Rio
- Just be only names to you and me
- Is there any more?
I feel certain there are people we'd be glad to know there
So tell me why don't we get up and go there
Go to those fabulous places where we long to be
Go to Bangkok and Hong Kong and Paris and Venice
Tokyo and Cairo and Lisbon and London
Wonderful, fabulous places
We're longing to see
When I think of the warm Caribbean
I see a new world for you and me
I'd give anything just to have one single day there
Once we get there
I know that we'll stay there
Stay in those fabulous places where we long to be
-  Such as Siam
-  Sienna
-  Vienna
-  Verona
- Java, Jamaica
- Jamaica, Bombay
-  Barcelona
- Ole!
- Ole! Ole! Ole!
- El toro!
- Ha, ha!
- Ole! Ole! Ole!
Show me those fabulous places
I'm longing to see
My dear Miss Fairfax, you seem to have entirely missed the point.
I'm aware there are fabulous places wherever we sail
- Will we see them?
- We will.
But the point of the journey is science and finding the snail
An incomparable thrill
We shall question the sharks off the coast of Tobago
Interview swamp life in Tierra del Fuego
-  That sounds horrendous
-  No, no, it's tremendous and well worthwhile
We'll make detailed inquiries of every crustacean we meet
- Crustacean?
-  Shellfish, they're sweet
We will sail to the ends of the earth
Till our search for the snail is quite complete
We'll interrogate beetles and bugs in Nigeria
And if we have to spend weeks in Siberia
Eighty below but a place that we all ought to see
But I haven't brought the right clothes for Siberia
Those are the fabulous places you'll visit with me
Sounds as if we're in for a good time.
Well, Siberia is one place you'll never see me go
Stick in the pin
Where the pins goes, then we go
- Ireland!
- Romania!
- No, Ruritania!
We'll chase that sea snail from here to Tasmania
Show me those fabulous places
I'm longing to
I'm longing to
See
It doesn't count.
You landed in the sea.
No, she hasn't. Look. There.
Well, that doesn't look very interesting.
- What is it?
- "Sea Star Island.
Last reported position."
Last reported position?
What can that mean?
The Sea Star Island. That's faintly familiar. Yes, yes, yes, yes.
"Seashore, sea slug, sea snail.
Sea Star Island."
It's that floating island.
It moves all over the world like a ship.
It's a freak of nature.
This time of year it's sometimes sighted off the coast of Africa.
How terribly exciting.
I think you have chosen rather well.
I don't think it's exciting at all.
Couldn't we go to...
Couldn't we go to Monte Carlo?
Miss Fairfax, this is a serious zoogeographical expedition.
It's not a pleasure cruise for your personal benefit.
I promise to ask for no special privileges.
I promise to grant none.
A ship is no place for a woman.
The simple answer then is to treat me like a man.
I intend to.
Well, good-bye.
Twelve.
Uh-huh. How is the score, Stubbins?
And the arithmetic?
You're winning, sir, I think.
Ah, well, that's the first sure sign we've been at sea too long.
Polynesia spoke to some swallows.
They said there's a terrific storm up ahead. Isn't that marvelous?
No, it isn't.
Can't we drive round it?
I shouldn't think so.
The latest long-range fish forecast wasn't too encouraging.
Jip said he could smell thunder.
- I didn't know thunder had a smell.
- It does if you're a dog.
Uh, 82. Mind you,
Jip does tend to exaggerate.
If you ask me, bein' at sea is very much the same as bein' in prison, except at sea ya stand a better chance of drownin'.
That reminds me. One of the ship's rats came to see me this afternoon.
Said he had a distinct tingle in his tail, a sure sign the ship was going down.
So his lot are preparing to leave, according to rat tradition.
He highly recommended we should do the same.
There's nowhere we can go.
- Exactly. That's what I told the rat.
- Two.
- What was that?
- A bit of lightning. That's all.
When you finish clearing up, you better batten down the hatches and stay below.
Women are always scared stiff of storms.
Well, I'm not.
I'm a man, remember?
I dread to think what this is going to do to my azaleas.
August 10.
Signs of inclement weather.
Crew's morale remains high.
Steady as she goes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much, indeed.
- Any sign of her, Polynesia?
- Not yet.
Ah, good morning, Stubbins.
Beautiful day.
Yes, sir, good morning.
What happened to the ship?
Very good question.
If we ever find enough bits, we'll put them together and find out.
Come on, Matthew.
Rise and shine.
I told ya Flounder was a terrible name for a boat.
Nonsense. The flounder's a most reliable little fish.
It's survived the sea for thousands of years.
Aye, below the surface.
Anyway, we're all safe.
That's the main thing.
- At least, we will be as soon as we find Miss Fairfax.
- Poor Fred.
I said all along a ship was no place for a woman.
Heaven knows I did my best to make the voyage pleasant for her.
You can't spend your life running after a woman, waiting on her hand and foot when there's important work to be done.
I think under the circumstances
I treated her very well.
Probably too well.
Spoiled her, in fact.
And I tied her very securely to that raft.
I hope she's all right.
That's all.
- We'll make a full-scale search as soon as we get ashore.
- Ashore?
Sea Star Island.
That's where we're going, isn't it?
Apart from the fact that we're shipwrecked, that we have no means of gettin' there, and that we don't know where it is anyway, yes.
You mustn't worry about things like that, Matthew.
By my calculations, we were sort of coming down in this direction like this, and the floating island was sort of coming down in that direction like that.
Then we sort of somehow or other sort of more or less meet... somewhere round about here.
Is that a fact?
Ah! There it is now.
Well, shall we go ashore?
Giddyap.
I must remember to get meself one of those.
Hmph. Any sign of Fred?
Not yet. I only hope she caught the island.
It won't be passing here again for months.
You and Stubbins search the beaches.
I'll go inland.
- Meet back here in two or three hours.
- Yeah. Tommy?
Polynesia, I want every living creature on this island looking for that girl.
Yes, Doctor.
- Every bird that can fly I want airborne until she's found.
- Yes, Doctor.
She can't be at sea.
We'd have heard from the fish by now.
- You sure she'll be all right, Polynesia?
- Yes, Doctor.
She's standing right behind you.
Good morning.
Oh, good morning.
Um, afraid we had a bit of a storm last night.
Thank you for telling me.
Pity you got lost. You could have given us a hand getting these ashore.
I'm sorry. I was fully occupied getting myself ashore.
No mind. We managed. Some of these books are very heavy though.
Saved all your books, I see.
- Yes, most fortunate.
- You lost all my dresses.
Yes, most unfortunate. I saw your trunk floating amongst the wreckage.
However, the outfit you're wearing this morning... is the nicest thing I've seen you in since you left England.
This is my underwear.
Oh. Anyway, it suits you.
I'm terribly glad to see you.
Are you?
Uh, well, we got a tremendous lot to do.
We've got to unload the raft, find food and build whatever it is one has to build.
- What are you trying to say?
- Hmm?
Why don't you say what you mean?
What do you mean, say what I mean?
For a month or more
I have listened and dreamed
While the moon has glistened and a million stars have gleamed
-  Waiting
- Waiting?
-  Waiting
- What for?
What for?  For a man
I know who is clever and kind
But a man who never ever seems to know his mind
Waiting
Waiting
Waiting for you to say you like me
Or hate me or miss me or kiss me or something
But nothing
Nothing do you say
At all
Little wonder I feel sorely neglected
Unwanted, rejected and small
Little more than two feet tall
Lucky to be here
At all
Emma?
I think I... like you.
Yes, I think I do.
I think I like you.
I'm almost sure that I do
I think I like the way you look
The way your eyes reveal your mind
Like a precious book that's hard to find
I think I'm learning something strange and new
But it's well worth learning
Because I'm learning about you
Like dawning sunshine
When a new day is due
I think I like you
And I think you like me too
Do you?
Do you?
Do you?
Good afternoon. Good afternoon.
Good heavens. I do believe that's a great crested oriental moonbird.
It's terribly rare.
I'm so glad we came.
Great crested oriental moonbird.
What a bit of luck.
Ah, that's better.
Thank you very much.
Bye-bye.
The locals aren't a very friendly lot, are they?
I bet you anything you like they're going to kill us.
Whoever said children had beautiful minds had obviously never met you.
Bein' in prison is much the same as bein' on a boat, except in prison there's less chance of drownin'.
And less chance of our getting back to Puddleby.
I must have a serious talk to whoever runs this place.
I promised to get Stubbins home in time to go to school.
I'm sure if you tell them that we'll be out of here in no time.
Give me a leg up.
I want to see what's going on out there.
Good heavens.
All right, Matthew. Down.
- Why is it so cold?
- It's like being back in England.
There's a bit of frost. That's all.
It's quite clear what happened.
The storm that sank the Flounder must have blown the island off its usual course.
We're drifting too far north.
If we don't do something about it, that marvelous vegetation is going to die of frostbite.
To say nothin' of our dear selves.
This is obviously the gentleman to talk to.
Good morning.
Me Dr. Dolittle.
Search for great pink sea snail.
Small boy late for school.
Here very cold.
They all go home
Puddleby, yes?
What a funny accent.
Oh, I beg your pardon.
Actually, that's what
I came to see you about.
My name is William Shakespeare, the Tenth. You may call me Willie.
Come with me, please.
Thank you.
We've had lots of shipwrecks, of course.
Being a floating island does tend to make us a bit of a danger to shipping.
We've bumped into lots of things over the years.
But on the credit side, it enabled us to build a marvelous museum... and public library... books and art treasures from all over the place.
Everybody on the island speaks nine or ten languages.
We even name our children after our favorite authors.
That's why my name is William Shakespeare.
Do forgive this paraphernalia.
We're rehearsing now
The Merchant Of Venice for our Shakespeare drama festival.
- Do sit down. Milk or lemon?
- Milk, please.
Must be a near perfect civilization.
Then what are we doin' in prison?
Purely a precaution, old boy, a sort of quarantine.
Most of the white men who have come here in the past... usually started killing people before they've been introduced.
- Extraordinary. Help yourself to sugar.
- Thank you.
But they never stay long.
They can't stand the peace and quiet.
I love peace and quiet, but unfortunately we won't be able to stay long either.
We've got to continue our hunt for the great pink sea snail.
You haven't by any chance heard of it being in the vicinity?
At the moment you have a bigger problem than looking for snails.
According to popular superstition, newcomers to the island are responsible for all our misfortunes.
So the elders of the village are blaming you for this frost.
I don't know what we can do about that. Perhaps there is something I can think of.
I do hope so for your sake.
You see, it's written here in the law book.
"He who brings sunshine to the coldness of our days... shall bask in the splendor of a thousand summers."
- That's very nice.
- Yeah.
Yes, but it goes on.
"He who brings winter into the summer of our lives... shall die the death of a thousand screams."
- Oh.
- I prefer the first one.
Yes, so did I.
The elders are also blaming you for what's happened to the animals.
What has happened to the animals?
They've all caught colds.
They're coughing and sneezing all over the place.
I must do something about this immediately. Come along, Polynesia.
We've got work to do.
Bless you.
Gesundheit.
Ha.
Here you are, Tommy. Another little baby lion for you to take care of.
Yes, sir.
Bless you.
That inhalant seems to be working very well.
Bless you.
I was hoping this mustard bath would work.
Still very hot.
How soon will my cough mixture be ready?
- Five minutes. Smell.
- Mmm!
I'd give it to the baby elephant first, if I were you.
- Why?
- She's got a terrible cold.
I want to control it before she gives it to the family.
When a herd of elephants start sneezing, it's like a hurricane.
Might drive the island even further off course. Thank you very much.
If we was to point them in the right direction, perhaps they could blow us back on course.
Pretty good theory, but terribly difficult to organize.
If elephants could swim, one good shove... and we'd be back in a southerly current before we could...
Why didn't I think of that before?
- They can swim.
- What, elephants?
No, no, no, Matthew. Tommy, what's as big as an elephant that can swim?
A whale, sir.
Exactly.
Emma, get on with the cough mixture.
Bless you.
Now, how do you get in touch with a whale?
I'll talk to him immediately.
Splendid.
Good morning. Marvelous, if the giraffe doesn't mind.
Extremely kind of you.
I do appreciate it.
Bless you.
You'll explain? Good.
Here he comes.
It was very decent of that turtle to put us in touch with him.
My word! He's a big fellow.
Now, if he gave a shove below us, that should just about do the trick.
Good morning.
One... shove... here.
We really must learn to speak a few words of whale.
Apparently they're very nice, but nobody ever talks to them.
Look!
Why is it doing that?
The island is bound to roll a bit after that shove.
It set that balancing rock in motion.
- It'll soon calm down.
- That would be highly desirable.
It says here in the law book,
"He who causes the great rock to fall into the hot mountain... shall die the death of 10,000 screams."
- Uh, how many screams did you say?
I shouldn't have thought it was worth more than five.
- I cannot tell you how upset I am about this.
- You're upset?
We realize it isn't your fault.
I've been through the law book from cover to cover.
There is nothing I can do.
- This is the tradition.
- Oh, well, we hate to break a tradition.
I once heard a story about a tribe that burned people alive, then et them for dinner.
I bet that's what they're going to do to us.
Will you please put a curb on your lurid imagination?
I'm sorry about this, Emma.
It hasn't been very relaxing the last few days, has it?
I think we've bumped into something.
Stop!
Release them!
Holy Pat.
What did we do now?
We've collided with the mainland.
The two pieces fit perfectly.
- How extraordinary.
- Not really.
The oldest legend of the island has always maintained... that we are a bit of Africa that has been missing for 5,000 years.
Is there a reward for finding it?
Oh, indeed, yes.
"He who brings back the lost island from the sea... shall live as a god for a thousand moons."
Thank you. Thank you.
That's very pleasant, but if you will excuse me,
I must get back to the hospital, in case the elephant sneezes and blows all the other patients away.
What will you do when the animals are all well again?
I have one great ambition.
I came to find a great pink sea snail.
I intend to find it.
The great pink sea snail is more than mythical.
I always thought that, too, Willie.
No, no. You can see the animals as they come out.
- Guard the gate, Matthew.
- Oh!
Come on. Come on.
- Why does he have the animals in there?
- All right, all right.
I'll tell ya.
Behind these gates is the most wonderful place in all the world.
- Can we see it?
- Can we see it?
- Shh!
- Shh!
This is the world of Dr. Dolittle
The wonderful world of Dr. Dolittle
Where crocodiles talk and elephants sing
And animals do most any old thing
Where polar bears wear top hats
And leopards with spots wear spats
Well, that's life in the world of Dr. Dolittle
Doves start to coo when they see Dolittle
He has a profound philosophy
If animals can be friends says he
Well, then why can't we
Matthew, open the gate.
Come on, baby. Up!
See they're all right, Matthew.
Say how do you do to the world of Dr. Dolittle
Say how do you do to the world of Dr. Dolittle
Life is a zoo to Dr. Dolittle
Life is a zoo to Dr. Dolittle
Where antelopes lope
-  And ostriches fan
-  And ostriches fan
And kangaroos do what kangaroos can
To make the hyenas laugh
As long as a long giraffe
Every calf starts to moo when they see Dolittle
Even the few who used to moo little
For all of the birds and beasts agree
He has a profound philosophy
And so why can't
We.
All of the birds and beasts agree
He has a profound philosophy
And so why can't we
Do little things to help them
Why
Can't
We
Oh.
Well, thank goodness they only had head colds.
Think how terrible it would have been if they'd had sore throats.
Our last two patients.
Well done, Emma.
Well, not a sniffle left on the island.
Interesting noise. Can't be.
You mean, the great pink sea snail...
Precisely, and by the sound of it, he seems to have caught a chill too.
So sorry.
I've never seen anything like it.
- Yes, I see.
Well, just a minute. Amazing!
- What is?
We've been searching for weeks for the great snail.
He's been with us all the time.
Lives in an underground cave and moves about with the island.
I was quite right. He's got a shocking cold. I told him I was a doctor, and if he'd come on the beach,
I'd mix him a batch of my special tonic.
It'll need to be rather large, won't it?
What's that?
- What is it?
- He's purring.
Thrilled with his medicine. Feels much more relaxed, almost like a new snail.
- Wanted to know if there's anything he can do for us.
- Is there?
Yes, he can take you all safely back to Puddleby.
Oh, well. Well, that's a bit of an imposition.
Puddleby's a long way away. All you did was give him a little medicine.
He's 2,000 years old.
He's lonely. It'll be company for him.
He'd been planning to visit his cousin in Scotland for 300 years and put it off.
Be a great opportunity for him.
- His cousin in Scotland?
- You've heard of the Loch Ness monster?
- Yes.
- Well, it's a cousin.
- Good heavens.
- Travel under the sea?
But it's bad enough on top.
We'd all drown, Doctor.
No, the shell is completely watertight.
It'll be like traveling in a big pink bubble.
Yes, he says he can get you back to Puddleby by two weeks from Tuesday.
This must be the only snail in the world with four bedrooms.
Oh, and, Polynesia, don't forget to remind the snail to surface twice a day for his cough mixture.
It will fix up his cold, and stretch your legs and get some sea air.
- Yes, Doctor.
- Oh, good.
I'd hate to miss my turn on deck.
And, Chee-Chee, don't eat all the bananas. Leave some for the others.
Shh, shh. Don't be sad.
That's all, sir.
Good-bye, Stubbins.
Go up to the house whenever you like.
Yes, sir. And, Doctor, come home soon, sir.
Well...
Well, I'll, uh... I'll send your other high hat back from Puddleby, Doctor.
The snail can bring it back with him.
Yours is looking a little grubby now.
You'll probably find it a bit difficult to get one here.
Yes, uh, probably.
Well, thank you, Matthew.
Well, uh, good-bye.
Bye.
Uh, give my love to everyone at home, to Gub-Gub and Dab-Dab and everyone.
Good-bye, John Dolittle.
Take care!
Well, Tom, I still wish he was comin' with us.
I've never driven one of these things before.
Sure you won't change your mind and come with us?
I can't, Emma. Your uncle will put me away the moment I set foot in Puddleby.
But you have to come back one day.
I hope so. A lot of animals depend on me.
One or two people too.
Puddleby's going to seem very dull after all this excitement.
I mean, what are you going to do here?
I think I'll start planning my next voyage.
Where are you going this time? The moon?
- Very probably, yes.
- You're not serious.
- Oh, yes.
- How?
On the giant lunar moth.
Magnificent creature.
Flies backwards and forwards between the earth and the moon.
When it reaches one, it's attracted by the light of the other and flies back again.
Willie tells me there's one on the island.
My idea is to build some sort of saddle arrangement,
- very secure, so I don't fall off halfway.
- Can I come?
Hmm?
Can I come with you?
Emma, I'm afraid...
I'm not very good with people.
L... I'm all right with animals, but people...
I'm not very good with.
I never have been.
I don't know why.
I'll write to you.
I'll organize an air postal service with the seagulls.
I'll miss you, John Dolittle.
Well, I'll tell you one thing, Tom.
If we ever drown in this thing, it'll be in a flood of tears.
Sophie. What are you doing here?
No. Oh, how do you do, sir?
Really? Good Lord.
Sophie, that's marvelous news.
Thank you very much, indeed.
Good-bye, Sophie.
Thank you. Thank you!
"Good night, sweet Prince, and flights of angels sing thee to thy rest."
Willie! Willie!
Wonderful news.
Sophie, the seal, and her husband have come to tell me... all the animals in England are on strike.
They refuse to do any work until I'm reprieved.
- You can go home?
- Yes. The local magistrate is begging me to go back.
The whole country's paralyzed without the animals.
- Congratulations.
- Thank you very much.
I think that tree is about the right size.
It's a 60-foot overall wingspan.
- But you've missed the snail.
- I've got a better idea.
I'm going to fly home.
Can you imagine their faces when they see me on the quayside waiting for them in Puddleby?
- Fly home?
- Since you say there's one on the island, on the lunar moth.
- Help me make a model so I can gauge where to put the saddle.
- Certainly.
I've got to allow for a very steep rate of climb.
Now, you see, you'll be the wings.
All of you. That's it.
Just sit down inside those lines I've just drawn.
Everybody. That's the idea.
Good. Yes, I think it's going to work splendidly.
As soon as I've built this saddle, we'll go and have a chat with the lunar moth.
I only hope he understands common house moth. That's all I speak.
Then as soon as the moon comes up, we'll be off to Puddleby.
Wonderful night for flying.
By my calculations I should be home in time for breakfast.
The stars are made of lemon drops
The bigger ones are lollipops and ice
The clouds have shops up on the tops
That sell you sweets and soda pops
What do they call the place
Isn't it paradise
Maybe what the doctor tells me
Isn't altogether true
But I know every tale he tells me
I don't know any better ones
Do you
My friend the doctor says the world is full of fantasy
And who are you and I to disagree
Let's hope and pray that is the way
The life we love will always stay
For my friend the doctor
And me
Are you hurt, Sister?
It's a miracle we weren't both killed.
Couldn't you see me, Sister?
Oh, yes, I-- Of course--
Are you all right?
I had the right of way, Sister. I was coming right down the center of the road.
Right down the center, in plain sight.
You just couldn't miss me.
I almost didn't.
-Oh, thank you.
-Are you sure you're all right?
Oh, yes.
Oh, I'm all right.
I just hope the scooter's all right.
You see, we all drive it at the convent.
What a world.
The last thing I expected to see coming at me is a nun on a scooter.
What kind of nuns are they making at that convent nowadays?
Hard-headed ones, thank God.
Oh, my.
Go on, here.
I know. Who wants that? There you are.
Tsk, tsk, tsk. Oh, dear.
There's someone at the door!
-I'll go.
-1 hope it's Father Clementi with more paint.
I have to attend to everything.
I can't be two places at once.
-I'm getting it--
-Don't bother.
I was only peeling potatoes for stew.
-Nothing to do but answer doorbells.
-Well, as long as you're not busy.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I thought this was out of order.
Oh, no.
It worked perfectly with every pull.
I'm Sister Ann.
Oh, yes. I'm Sister Cluny.
We were expecting you earlier.
I'm a little late. I came on the scooter.
I put it under the shed outside.
Oh, I'm sorry.
That, uh--?
That is part of your effects?
Sister Adele's in here. My guitar.
-Guitar?
-Yes, Sister.
I would suggest the best place for her is in the music closet.
I'll take good care of her.
What's that funny smell?
It's either fresh paint or my stew.
Well, let's hope it's the fresh paint.
Sister Ann, welcome.
Oh, my dear child.
Welcome to Samaritan House.
Thank you, Mother.
I'm so happy to be here.
You must be tired after your trip.
And hungry too, I imagine.
I was beginning to worry about you.
You are a little late.
I know, but I was riding along pretty fast on the scooter...
...when this barge captain whistled at me.
The boat whistled.
This farmer in a cart landing on my head...
...and these cobblestone streets,
I'm still bouncing.
Well, anyway, you are here.
Did you have any difficulty in finding us?
No, but when I turned the corner,
I thought I had the wrong address.
The streets are so-- And the people.
We know.
That's why this is the ideal spot for us, don't you think?
Of course, Mother. I just hadn't pictured it as quite this ideal.
-I'm glad you brought your guitar.
-I'll put it away.
No, Sister Cluny. It's quite allowable for Sister Ann to keep it with her.
She won't be a nuisance, Sister.
-Sister Ann.
-Sister Elise.
We wondered when you'd be here.
You're usually early.
-I'm a little late--
-Sister Ann.
Sister Brigitte.
Sister Mary.
Sister Ann.
Oh, this is a fine reunion.
It's so good to see you.
-Guess how I got here?
-How?
-l was permitted to borrow the scooter.
-No.
-Not really?
-It turned out to be quite an adventure.
This is going to be the community hall when it's finished.
All this?
- It's enormous.
- We have all our meals here too.
And it'll be for dances and meetings and--
- And singing and parties.
- For all the neighborhood people.
Father Clementi promised to make us some chairs and whatever else we need here.
He's a wonderful carpenter.
Chairs?
Oh, we could put six along that wall and four over there and--
Oh, I'm sorry, I get carried away.
I'll have the curtains ready in a day or so.
When we're finished, this place won't look so empty.
Empty? Oh, I don't think it looks empty.
I think it looks wonderful.
And if we just move the piano over there--
I'll give it a push.
You see what I mean.
Would you like to see the rest of the house now?
I'd love to.
-I'm being taken on a tour of inspection.
-Good.
Start with the kitchen.
You'll be spending your time there.
I don't mind.
Well, what do you think of her,
Sister Cluny?
Talks a lot.
She has a natural enthusiasm.
It may be just what we need around here.
We need workers, Mother, not enthusiastic guitar players.
-The guitar goes where she goes.
-A personal possession?
A material remembrance of her past life?
Is this part of our liberalization too?
-Yes, and I think for the better.
-Maybe.
Why, she ever came here unaccompanied, on a scooter.
Her true and greatest protector was still with her.
Why, I hoped they'd send us a more mature sister.
Ah, but we need our young nuns,
Sister Cluny.
They come to us fresh from their tranquil convents...
...and still fired with their ambition to become missionaries.
Eager, hopeful and--
Well, yes, I must admit it, inexperienced.
They're like girls graduating from school into the world.
And their training here won't be easy.
Some of their bright dreams of becoming missionaries may fade...
...in the harsh reality of hard work.
Some of them may even fail us...
...or we may fail them.
But those that go on, Sister Cluny, they will be nuns.
I still say this brand-new one doesn't seem to have any special skills...
...except playing that guitar.
Don't be too hard on that guitar.
It belonged to her father.
And she was a very little girl during the dreadful war years when he--
Well, the guitar is really the only family she's ever known.
It's going to get noisy around here.
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.
Oh, Father Clementi.
I was hoping to run into you.
Mr. Messeraux asked me to tell you that barrel of flour for the sisters...
-...will be sent from the bakery tomorrow.
-Oh, thank you.
They're grateful for any help.
And the merchants in this neighborhood have been so kind.
-Oh, we're happy to be able to help, Father.
-Well, we appreciate it. Thank you again.
Yes, Mr. Muller, I'm afraid we've run out of paint for the walls.
What was the last color I gave you?
-Beige.
-Beige.
-How are you, Mrs. Muller?
-Marvelous.
No, two gallons, please.
Anything else, Father?
Well, we could use a pound of tenpenny nails.
Tenpenny nails. Mm-hm.
And I need another pot of glue for those chairs I am finishing.
Pot of glue.
There you are.
Oh, and some steel wool to hand rub a pulpit for the choir.
Oh, some steel wool.
Yes, Father.
Oh, good.
-Anything else, Father?
-No, that will do it.
How much is all that, huh?
I hate to charge the nuns for things they need.
Why, thank you.
That's more than generous.
I wish I could do something for you in return.
Father, if you ever have a free moment,
I do need shelves next to my stove.
It's a bargain. I'll have them finished, put them up for you...
...by Saturday morning, all right?
Thank you again, so much.
Forget something?
The sisters mentioned a few hooks for the closets.
I'm sorry. I'm getting so forgetful.
Next time, I'll make a list. All right?
Yes, hooks.
How many?
A dozen?
Lead us not into temptation but--
I've forgotten "deliver us from evil."
I have it.
Good.
All right.
Deliver us from evil.
Oh, I did it again.
And we are minus a cup.
Oh, well, never mind. I'll consider it mine and drink out of the saucer.
There's no need to worry.
They will understand you.
My music should give me a good ear...
...but I suppose I'm so happy to be here,
I'm just not thinking.
Can you imagine how excited I will be if someday we are sent to Africa?
You must not expect a Garden of Eden.
It is burning hot there and so poor.
Don't you want to go?
Of course I want to go, Sister.
But more than that, I want you to go.
And learn how my people sing the Mass.
But first we must learn to live here.
"Eat as those around you eat.
Share their suffering, share their poverty and your love of God."
That's what Saint Dominic said.
No use hiding the evidence.
Sister Cluny counts the china every night, instead of sheep.
Well, she does?
Sisters, Father Clementi is here.
Wait till you see the harvest he's reaped for us.
Father Clementi!
Oh, wonderful.
Nails, glue, paints, and hooks for the closets.
-Thank God.
-And wonderful.
The Mullers were so generous...
...I promised to make shelves
Mrs. Muller's been needing.
Here, I'll take it out of your way.
Excuse me.
It goes to my workroom.
Well, Sister.
I haven't seen you before, have I?
Let me guess. Ah!
I have it. You are our latest and very welcome addition.
Sister-- No, Sister Mary, don't tell me.
-Sister Ann, am I right?
-Yes, Father.
And I am Father Clementi of this parish.
Here, let me get rid of this.
Now I can welcome you properly.
I assure you, you are most welcome,
Sister Ann.
I'm most fortunate to be here, Father.
She brought a guitar.
Oh, wonderful!
For our recreation hour, we always have a little music here.
Up to now, just the best we could do with a piano, but a guitar?
That will add spice to our familiar "Brother John."
-Will you get your guitar and join us, Sister?
-Of course, Father.
Now we have an orchestra.
-1 always do the piano, Father.
-Of course. Of course.
-And beautifully.
-Thank you.
Ah. Just in time for our evening concert, Mother.
I never miss it.
Don't tell me you've never noticed my fine alto, Father.
Have you an E, Sister Cluny?
No, you have to get along with an A.
Are you ready?
There's a smile on your face
Brother John
Brother John
There's a smile upon your face
Brother John
Brother John
When there's a smile upon your face
Then the world's a happy place
When you wear a gloomy frown
The world comes tumbling down
Won't you smile for us all, Brother John?
-Brother John
-Brother John
-Brother John
-Brother John
When there's a smile upon your face
The world's a happy place
Won't you smile for us all, Brother John?
-Brother John
-Brother John
-Brother John
-Brother John
When there's a smile upon your face
The world's a happy place
Won't you smile for us all, Brother--2?
Well, what happened?
Why did we all stop?
You sing very well, Sister!
I say my prayers with my guitar, Father.
Well, compared to you,
I'm a croaking frog.
Do you mind singing a little prayer without the frog?
You tell them about "Sister Adele."
Oh, yes, please.
Sit down, Sister.
Thank you, Father.
I will sing of Adelita
I will sing of Sister Adele
‘Twas never a servant so faithful
She wants but to serve the Lord well
Adele is my dear companion
Together we've traveled so far
Together we sing as we worship
Adele is my Spanish guitar
Though you're only a wooden guitar
And so humbly the music you play
If there's love in your heart
Wherever you are
The Lord will not turn you away
And so together
We'll sing his praise
And the music the Lord shall hear
We'll tell his glory in a thousand ways
And we'll plead for his love so dear
That was marvelous.
Mother Prioress, is this liberalization?
Make a joyful noise unto the Lord.
Come before his presence with singing.
Come on, kick it!
Kick it! Get it!
Come on, kick it!
Come on, kick!
-Come on.
-Come on, let's go.
Come on.
You kicked me.
My foot missed the ball.
No, your aim was perfect and you hurt my shin.
Why don't you wear stockings?
I do.
You can't play soccer in long skirts.
Why do you wear long skirts?
The same reason you wear stockings, to keep my legs warm.
Oh, no, no, no, you don't. Mm-mm.
I want to talk to you.
Now.
You don't look like a young man who would kick anybody.
Why did you?
I wanna get back to the game.
Oh, oh, you don't.
-What's your name?
-Dominic. Dominic Arlien.
Oh, I'm surprised you won't answer me...
...because you're named after a very great man, Saint Dominic.
-Would he have answered you?
-He would.
And he never would have kicked me.
You two gonna play or not?
- I'm wounded.
- Come on.
Mothers are here.
Time to go, boys and girls.
Mothers are here.
Hey.
Well, time to go.
Mothers are here.
Come on. Come on. Come on.
Bye-bye.
Dominic?
Your mother did not come for you?
I-- I haven't got a mother.
I haven't either.
-You haven't?
-No.
Well...
...maybe you don't need a mother anymore.
-Do you need one, Dominic?
-Uh-uh.
I'm a good fighter. I don't need anybody.
Somebody may need you though.
-Who?
-A lot of people.
They don't like me. They're afraid of me.
Maybe you don't give them a chance.
First, you have to start by liking them.
And then their liking you will come as easy as anything.
Who cares? I could lick you.
What muscles!
With all that power, you could be a real leader.
Once a boy named Dominic
To whom I sing this song
Kicked someone in the shins
And knew that he had done wrong
Now if this boy named Dominic
Ever tries another whack
He's going to be sorry
When that someone kicks him back
But he wasn't really a bad boy
And he grew up big and strong
And he fought for all the good things
Instead of the things that were wrong
If this boy was really sorry
This could end up a true story
-You made that up.
-That's right.
I made it up for you.
Dommie?
Dominic!
-That's my sister. I gotta go now.
-Run along, Dominic.
-l kicked you on purpose.
-1 know.
-Hurry up, Dom!
-Oh, Nicole!
Tuck your shirt in.
Are you ready to go?
I'm Sister Ann, Nicole.
We're very happy having Dominic here.
I wonder if you heard we're going to have young people's dances every Saturday?
Why, no, I didn't.
We hope you'll come and bring an escort.
I can't. I work Saturdays.
What a shame.
What sort of work do you do, Nicole?
I'm a maid. These people entertain a lot.
We have to go now, Dominic.
Say goodbye.
Bye, Sister.
Can we finish the game tomorrow?
Of course. See you tomorrow, Dominic.
Goodbye, Nicole.
It's too bad you didn't come earlier, Father.
We could've used a good goalie.
Oh, I went to see a fellow I know who works for Primavera Records in Ghent.
Records we could play at our dances,
Father, if we had a juke box?
This time, it was the other way around,
Sister. I wasn't taking, I was giving...
...giving them a chance to make a recording of you.
-Of me?
-Yes.
Why, they probably expect and I--
What did you tell them?
Not them.
I just talked to my friend for a while.
Well, give or take an hour or so.
And he more or less gave in.
How do you feel about it?
Well, I don't know.
I only sing hymns, my own thoughts.
-Besides, Mother Prioress wouldn't allow it.
-She did.
Truly now, Sister,
I've given this a great deal of thought.
Oh, the record will only be sent to convents, you see?
So that sisters all over the world can find joy in your songs.
But I'm so busy here...
...and the time it takes to ride back and forth to Ghent--
Oh, all right.
-When?
-Tomorrow.
Oh, no.
-It'll be just another minute, Father.
-Thank you.
It won't be long now, Sisters.
But when she took her drums,
I hoped I never saw her again.
-Hello there.
-Hello.
Would you like a cigarette?
No, thank you.
What's the name of your act?
Our act?
Oh, what's the name of yours?
We're the Mexican Marauders.
Oh, we're the Dominican Desperadoes.
-Cute.
-Sisters.
Thank you.
I will see you later.
Mr. Gerarde will see us now.
Sorry to have kept you and the sisters waiting.
I might've known a high-pressure character like you would be ahead of time.
No apology needed, Robert.
We are deeply grateful for your kindness.
Think nothing of it.
I've arranged to put you in Studio B.
Right this way.
-Where are you taking the jukebox, boys?
-To the storeroom.
Is it out of order?
No, we just don't need it anymore.
Studio B is to the left.
Give me an idea of how many records you'll need for the convent.
-As a guess, a thousand.
-A thousand.
And upwards.
Here we are.
-Not very large, I'm afraid.
-Oh, it's large enough.
Imagine, Mr. Gerarde, if we had had these facilities at the conservatory.
Paris Conservatory. Lucienne.
Sister Ann, Robert.
Five years ago, I lost track of you.
-How do you want this, Mr. Gerarde?
-Tape it.
We studied at the conservatory together.
She graduated, I quit.
If I saw you on the street,
I wouldn't recognize you--
I know.
You cannot tell one nun from another.
But it's easy.
This is Sister Michele, Sister Mary,
Sister Ann.
Sister Ann? Good Lord.
Exactly.
-You'd better lower that all you can.
-Yes, sir.
Emile, be sure of the balance on this.
I promised Father Clementi a perfect job.
Right.
Adele, you're looking well.
Sister Adele now, Robert.
-You got her too, did you, Father?
-She's a very devout guitar.
She never told you about the night she spent in a pawnshop...
-...to pay for my fine when I was arrested.
-She does not tattle.
And he'd only been speeding, Father.
Usually he was a very hardworking music student.
What do you do here, Robert?
Mr. Duvries and I are partners.
I suppose I'm an executive.
Sounds impressive, but what do you do?
This and that. Discover new talent, shape and groom their careers.
Make sure their affection for Primavera Records is deathless.
-And legally binding?
-Both ways, Father.
-We're all set here, Mr. Gerarde.
-Fine.
-Father, won't you be seated over there?
-Thank you.
What will you sing, Sister Ann?
-A little hymn. Sister Michele.
-Thank you.
A little hymn?
All Sister Ann's songs are like prayers.
Well, I really must be leaving. Back to--
Emile will take good care of you.
Good luck on your hymn.
Thank you, Robert.
-Sister.
-Thank you, Sister Mary.
Could I hear a few bars?
Far beyond the stars
That's fine, thank you.
Far beyond the stars
My soul is longing to go
There beyond the sun
To a better place I know
Through the darkest night
I can see the heavenly glow
-Far away
-Far away
Beyond the stars
-Far away
-Far away
Beyond the stars
Time ages of time
Yet is my time, so dear
The bells hasten to chime
Warning the hour is near
The road leads far away
And soon the days disappear
And I sing hallelujah
Unto him
Alleluia
Far beyond the stars
My soul is longing to go
There beyond the sun
To a better place I know
Through the darkest night
I can see the heavenly glow
-Far away
-Far away
Beyond the stars
-Far away
-Far away
Beyond the stars
Yeah
Love that baby, yeah
Oh, that baby
Baby, you're all mine
She's my baby, yeah
Love that baby, yeah
Oh, that baby
Gerarde, one moment, please?
Gerarde, we need Studio B and it's full of nuns.
They should be through by now, Duvries.
Let's see.
There beyond the sun
To a better place I know
Through the darkest night
I can see the heavenly glow
Far away
Far away
Beyond the stars
Far away
Far away
Beyond the stars
Not bad for a nun.
Not bad at all. Perfect, Sisters.
Is that all?
-That is all.
-Thank you.
Well, Robert? I didn't oversell her, did I?
You have a job as manager if you ever decide to take off that collar.
Sorry. It's nailed on. Heh-heh.
And you, you were absolutely--
What can I say?
I'm so happy you liked our little hymn,
Robert.
- Liked it? Emile, we'll do another.
- Right.
-Another?
-Yes.
-You have something else?
-Yes, Robert.
May I see?
Here you are.
That's not what sleeves are for.
Here.
I didn't know you had a pocket in that dress.
I have one here and another here.
This is for my prayer book and my other rosary, see?
You could hide a lot of stuff in there, couldn't you?
Certainly could.
I only got room for my bottle tops and corks.
-No room for the rosary?
-1 don't need one.
Oh, I do.
-I count the beads when I say my prayers.
-You could count in your head.
Oh, I say so many, I might get mixed up.
You're not very smart, are you, Sister?
Not very.
Come on.
Here it is.
Hello, Papa.
Who's this?
I'm Sister Ann from Samaritan House,
Mr. Arlien.
Well, he's a big boy.
He doesn't need to be walked home.
Usually Nicole is with him.
She didn't come for him today.
You can never tell about her.
Aren't you gonna let Sister in, Papa?
Well, if she wants to.
The place doesn't look like much, but with Nicole out working all hours...
...and with me not feeling up to it, what do you expect?
I understand, but that should not stop us from having a visit.
Well, I was just gonna go down to the corner.
-You mind if I stay? Nicole may possibly--
-No, no, that's quite all right.
That's quite--
You just make yourself at home.
Papa goes to the corner when he feels terrible.
Hey, look, another cork.
-You wanna see my room?
-Yes.
This is Papa's room. Now, come with me.
Nicole and I sleep here.
This is Nicole's bed and this is mine.
Oh, dear.
I tell you what we'll do. Uh....
Let's surprise Nicole and straighten things up for her. Hm?
You take the blankets and the sheets off the bed...
...and then we'll make them up.
I'll pick up her things.
What's the use?
They only get messed up again at night.
But you sleep better without the lumps.
Men don't make beds.
Soldiers do in the army.
Bed-making time.
Resting time.
You can't get by that easily. Let's go.
Nicole's gonna be home any minute.
Come on.
All right.
Dommie? You home?
Uh-huh.
Good.
Dominic, you stay here and go on working.
I'll keep her in the other room. Hm?
All right.
Papa go out?
Nicole?
What are you doing here?
I came home with Dominic.
We wanted to surprise you and straighten your room.
I found these.
You--
-You snooping-- You--
-I'm sorry.
-No, I'm glad. I'll have an opportunity--
-You showed them to Dommie?
Of course not, Nicole.
-Why did you?
-Why don't you leave me alone?
Not until we have a talk.
I cannot turn my back now that I know about these.
I want to help you.
I don't want your help.
Help from God, then.
He hasn't paid the rent so far.
And you can get this straight.
I'll keep on making these pictures.
And if I get enough money,
I'll make more and more.
What pictures?
Oh, it's all right, Mr. Arlien.
Nicole and I were just talking.
-You give me those.
-Mr. Arlien, let me handle this.
You don't expect me to support this family and buy your liquor mopping floors, do you?
Oh, stop. Keep your hands off her!
You come back here.
You come back here!
How dare you treat her like that?
You must use kindness and understanding.
-Oh, understanding?
-And love, I beg you.
Yeah, I only understand one thing.
That's my daughter.
That's my flesh and blood.
It's none of your business.
It has to be somebody's business.
I'll talk to her.
I want you out of here. I don't need you around my children. Out. Out.
Get out. Out and stay out.
It all started because
I wanted to clean up her room.
-l wanted to be helpful.
-But were you being helpful?
Or were you interfering?
Nicole was not there to accept your offer of help...
...but you decided to give it anyway.
But after I found the pictures,
I had to try to talk to her.
Yes, of course. Yes.
But even though you only suspected Nicole was at fault...
...yet you accused her in front of her father.
Now in future, try to make sure that any suspicion of sin...
...remains strictly a private matter between you and the sinner.
And I involved her father.
Well, you never know what you'll uncover in some places.
The truth is, I find it difficult to love a girl like Nicole.
I wanted to do so much when
I came here and I've made a bad start.
Don't expect to win great victories here, my child.
Or even in Africa someday.
Be thankful for small ones.
And try to keep in mind always that your motive is what is important.
To serve our Lord.
I have a lot to learn.
I'll give you a rule to go by.
If you can't be helpful, be silent.
Thank you, Mother.
And thank you, Sister Cluny.
A million dollars?
That is what I think one album of hers ought to make.
Her share would go to our order, be allotted to various missions.
Under no circumstances would we consent to anything...
...that might disturb
Sister Ann's vocation.
No, of course not.
But it could be a great blessing.
A million dollars usually is.
Good afternoon, Mr. Gerarde.
-Robert, what are you doing here?
-Waiting for Father Clementi.
He's in talking with Mother Prioress.
I'd like to talk to you.
-I'm very busy. I don't think I could take--
-May I sort of follow you around?
I would like you to see the place.
-l guess it's all right. This way, Robert.
-Here. Let me.
-Thank you.
-Lucienne-- Sister Ann.
-It's difficult for me to call you that.
-Yes.
I've been playing your record over and over. That's why I'm here.
To ask permission to sign you to a contract.
Do you think there's a market for my hymns, Robert?
Sister Mary?
-Sister Mary set up our dispensary.
-Sister.
Nothing elaborate, but a start.
-Hello.
-Hello, muddy Maurice.
Milk time.
Oh, look at that pretty face.
That boy could find a mud puddle in the middle of the Sahara.
Well...
Come on, let's have a little drink.
Oh, come on, please?
Let me live down what I said about your hymns.
Exciting, good music. You're an artist.
You should be proud of yourself.
Thank you, Robert.
But if we believe God is in all artists...
...then we should be only humble for what he has given us.
All right. But as an artist, you should be heard.
-Oh, I am heard here. Ask Sister Cluny.
-Here?
I'm talking about a--
I'm talking about an audience of millions.
People all over the world.
People who have never heard your kind of--
Would you like some milk?
-Hello. Would you like a little refreshment?
-Thank you.
-We're running out of tires, Sister.
-We'll have to go see Gaston again.
What are they doing?
Putting rubber heels on shoes.
Saving money.
Saving pennies.
When I'm trying to make you understand that just one album of yours--
Would you care for some milk?
Here you are.
- Yeah.
- We have another--
I don't know much about the protocol of talking to a nun...
...but I knew you once.
What made you give up everything for this?
It's depressing that you should be here.
But I want to be here.
You know what I mean.
What kind of girl wants to get up in the middle of the night...
...eat a Spartan breakfast, put in a back-breaking day...
...among people like these...
...and live in a tomb?
-No girl would.
-That's what you do.
Not I.
I get up in the middle of the night to go to Mass.
And then I have a Spartan breakfast.
Followed by doing the dishes, studying, visits in the neighborhood...
...playing with the children, feeding them, doing more dishes...
...and then more prayers. You see?
Much more glamorous and fascinating than you thought.
Isn't it?
How can you joke about it?
Because I'm very happy.
I even have a dispensation to laugh once in a while.
Good. I still like to laugh with you.
But I don't think you realize how much there is in this world you're missing.
Maybe you don't understand how much there is outside this world you're missing.
Maybe I don't.
Now, about the album, will you?
Robert, I told you, I'm very happy here.
I'm doing what I want to do.
My, you have become a stubborn girl.
-I've become a nun.
-So you turn me down?
Yes, Robert.
Can't you understand the joy I feel working for God?
Don't, please don't pity me.
Well, I tried. I'm sorry.
Don't be.
I have good news, Robert.
Mother Prioress has no objection to your making the album.
Providing the bishop gives his consent.
I don't see why not.
No, in view of everything,
I don't really see why not.
You know I'm inclined to be blunt,
Monsignor.
Suppose--
Suppose she has to sing before an audience.
Sister, you sing in church, don't you, in front of an entire congregation?
Well, not with a guitar.
And not because someone pays me.
Someday you will get your reward and a harp in heaven, Sister.
Do your singing, Sister Ann.
You will spread the word of God much better and much further than I ever shall.
Yes, Monsignor, if that's what the order wants me to do.
Does this settle the issue?
Thank you, Monsignor.
Thank you, Monsignor.
Sister Ann.
I can tell you now that I knew you'd reach out and take this chance.
Yes, Father.
With you I shall walk
All of my life
With you I'll always be
With you I shall spend
The rest of my life
My love in eternity
I was worried, wondering where you were at this late hour, my daughter.
And found you, safe with God.
I was troubled, Mother.
And now, are you more at peace?
I think so.
If you ever--
Remember, I am here too, my daughter.
Thank you, Mother.
Put on your pretty skirt, my soul
You rendezvous
You rendezvous
Put on your pretty skirt, my soul
The Lord we love is waiting for you
You wear a happy smile
You can't help but rejoice
For in a little while
You'll hear our Master's voice
Put on your pretty skirt, my soul
You rendezvous
You rendezvous
Put on your pretty skirt, my soul
The Lord we love is waiting for you
I'd like to be as free as the wind
That sings everywhere
I'd like to be as free as a cloud
That floats in the air
I'd like to be the flame of a fire
That lights the skies with my desire
To be with you
My Lord, with you
Raindrops, raindrops
Fall upon my window
Sparkle on the leaves
Of a thirsty apple tree
Raindrops, raindrops
Down the hill and through the meadow
No time to stop
On their journey to the sea
See the pretty raindrops
Dance upon the rooftops
Tumble down the chimneys
Then go splashing on their way
To every church and steeple
The world and all her people
There's a miracle of heaven
In every rainy day
Raindrops, raindrops
Fall upon my window
Sparkle on the leaves
Of a thirsty apple tree
Raindrops, raindrops
Down the hill and through the meadow
No time to stop
On their journey to the sea
The brook becomes a river
And the river flows forever
Till the--
- Is it all right if I rest a few minutes?
- Yes, of course.
I'll be right with you.
Andre, get some tea or something, will you?
That'll be all for tonight, gentlemen.
Thank you.
I didn't mean to fade off that way, Robert.
I just wanted to stretch a little.
No wonder, 14 songs.
I was having a wonderful time listening,
I forgot how exhausting it must be for you.
Why don't you sit down for a bit and relax?
That's a fine idea.
Five years ago, I'd have taken you out to a fine restaurant...
...for a bottle of wine and some good jazz.
Five years ago, I would have accepted.
Seems to me, I did.
I wish you could have heard yourself.
Your voice came across very clear.
No echo.
I left my echo at home.
Good thing too.
That one song, number four.
-"Alleluia.”
-Yes.
You put a little pause in there. I like that.
That's my kind of song.
The music always spoke a special language to you and me.
But you've grown.
You have a whole new dimension you never had then.
It comes from being very happy, Robert.
-You know who'd be proud of you?
-Hm?
-Professor Von Hoffritz.
-Oh.
"That guitar, Fraulein, is a musical instrument...
...not a defensive weapon.”
"Do not clutch it to your bosom like it was your first-born.
Do not point it like it was a machine gun in those American gangster films...
...and do not strangle it as if it was this beloved music professor."
Oh, you've come a long way from that music student I used to know.
-You've come a long way too, Robert.
-l suppose I have.
I wonder just how did I become a typical business executive.
What happened to your music, Robert?
It just got lost.
I needed more discipline and encouragement to work alone.
And perhaps the inspiration I once had.
It's too bad. You were very good.
I was so certain you would use your talents to brighten the world.
Did you ever finish it, Robert?
Sister Ann?
Ah, Lucienne.
What happened to the wonderful plans we made?
The good times we had together?
Where did I go to?
What did you say, Robert?
I didn't say anything.
Sister Ann, wait till you see what we bring.
Wait till you see.
We have a feast here.
- Oh, thank you, Robert. Look.
- You must be starving by now.
-Cheese, meat, salami.
-Oh, it's lovely.
-Some tea? Would you like some tea?
-Thank you very much.
Here, Sister. Help yourself.
-Oh, thank you.
-You, Robert.
Hey.
Oh, my.
That girl. Oh, my gosh.
-Does anyone here know this girl's name?
-That's Jeannette. Miss Jeannette.
That is a needle, Sister, not bayonet.
-Oh, dear.
-Now, try again.
The trouble is,
I keep thinking about the next step.
When I aim this thing at a live arm.
When you have to inoculate a hundred screaming children in Africa someday...
...you will not have time to think. Here.
Uh, thank you. I-- Oh.
-Put her there.
-What happened?
She was dancing and she just fainted.
-Her name is Jeannette.
-Thank you, Sister. We'll take care of her.
Here you are, Sister.
Thank you.
Feeling better?
Yes, thank you.
Have you had many of these fainting spells?
Some. I'm pregnant.
Well, congratulations.
I hope you have a nice, healthy baby.
I'm not going to have a nice, healthy anything.
I'm going to have an abortion.
You shouldn't even think such a dreadful thought.
-Why not?
-Having a baby is a wonderful thing.
Oh, now, just a minute--
And you're planning to have your baby deliberately killed.
-What did you say?
-1 said, you're planning to have your--
Sister, sister.
I understand how you feel.
You're not women, you're just stupid nuns.
Listen to me, Jeannette.
I was born in Africa in a mud shack.
Four children were born there before me.
Not one lived to see even six months of tomorrows.
There was no food, no sanitation.
So my mother went to the village medicine man...
...full of bitter tears. Just as you are.
And they tried, with all kinds of voodoo concoctions.
But every day of my life, since I have been old enough to understand...
...I prayed my thanks that they failed.
What do you hope to do about your baby, Jeannette?
Won't you come back?
We will do everything we can to help you.
She had no right to call me a murderess.
I hope she'll come back.
Yes, I know you do.
I wanted to help her.
But I didn't, though, did I?
It was a delicate, a very personal thing for her.
Maybe you attacked with too much fervor.
-Attacked?
-Yes.
Even if you believe there is a war between right and wrong...
...be sure you do not enjoy the battle too much.
When am I going to learn?
You will.
You will learn.
Amen.
Amen.
Are you not coming, Sister Ann?
Do you mind?
I wanna work on my music.
Won't you sing for us?
Oh, I'm sorry, Sister Mary, not tonight.
Sister Ann?
Don't you feel well?
Oh, yes, I'm just a little tired.
Well, in that case, maybe you'd better postpone working so much...
...with your music and rest.
Oh, I can't.
I have an idea for a new song.
-It isn't quite right yet.
-l see.
You have been very much in my thoughts the last few days, daughter.
I ask myself if perhaps we're not making a mistake...
...by placing too much importance on your music.
And if you might not be risking everything...
...by this misjudgment.
Oh, music has always been important to me, Mother.
I know. That's just what I'm afraid of.
When I was a young nun, to be sent somewhere as a missionary...
...was all-important to me.
And then I found the people strange...
...I didn't understand them and so I couldn't love them.
-And I thought I was a miserable failure.
-1 know.
The way I've been a failure with the people here.
But my music makes up for that.
I think I can do some good.
Why can't I love to sing and learn to love all people too?
How much love have you to give, my daughter?
People need all you have.
A little love is not enough.
Are you sure that your love for your music is not interfering with your other duties?
I hope not.
I will pray to God to help me.
Well, come with me a moment.
I have something to show you.
This is from Primavera.
They're giving a garden party at Mr. Duvries' home.
Publicity for your album.
They ask if you'll be good enough to come and bring your guitar...
...and be prepared to sing.
You don't have to accept, you know.
I'd like to.
And I'll be happy to sing for them.
Perhaps I should give them something after all they've given us.
I'm only concerned with what you give to God, my daughter.
But it's my way of doing good.
Don't you want me to go, Mother?
I think you've already made that decision yourself.
I'll write and tell them you accept.
How [ love to go
For a walk along the street
Just to smile "Hello"
To the people that I meet
And to watch the show
Of their happy. happy feet
And I say to myself it's a miracle
As I walk along
I sing a melody
It's a happy song
I'm sure you will agree
And when things go wrong
Oh, how it comforts me
Then I say to myself
It's a miracle
Allelu, alleluia
I sing as I walk along
Allelu, alleluia
God gave me such a happy, happy song
Can't you feel his love
And joy in everything
In the wonder of
The sparrow on the wing
In the stars above and the song I sing
In the joy of his love
In the stars up above
In the song that I sing
It's a miracle
"Brother John."
There's a smile on your face
Brother John
There's a smile upon your face
Brother John
When there's a smile upon your face
Then the world's a happy place
Won't you smile for us all
Brother John?
Brother John
Brother John
When there's a smile upon your face
Then the world's a happy place
Won't you smile for us all
Brother John?
When you wear a gloomy frown
Brother John
And when you wear a gloomy frown
Brother John
When you wear a gloomy frown
Then the world comes tumbling down
Won't you smile for us all
Brother John?
Brother John
Brother John
Brother John
When you wear a gloomy frown
Then the world comes tumbling down
When there's a smile upon your face
Then the world's a happy place
Won't you smile for us all, Brother John?
Brother John
Brother John
And when your heart is full of love
‘Tis a blessing from above
When you wear a gloomy frown
Then the world comes tumbling down
There's a smile upon your face
Then the world's a happy place
Won't you smile for us all
Brother John?
I have a confession to make, Sister.
I'm senile.
I was against her album.
Religious music, I said.
What made you think of combining folk music with prayers, Sister?
Perhaps I felt God might be tired of our formal, traditional hymns...
...and would enjoy a different kind of prayer once in a while.
May I have your autograph?
Oh, I'm sorry. I can't do that.
You see, I'm not a singer who happens to be a nun.
I'm a nun who happens to like to sing.
-She's quite witty too.
-Yeah.
This way, Sister.
Can you believe you're really a nun?
Yes, easily. I'm a Dominican nun.
What does that mean exactly?
There are different kinds of orders.
Sister, you haven't touched your pheasant.
Go ahead, eat.
-Where are you appearing next, Sister?
-Appearing?
Oh, we have great plans for this girl.
We'll be sending out releases.
-Robert, you take care of that.
-That's a little premature, don't you think?
-Sister, may I get you an ice?
-Yes, thank you.
She seems to be enjoying herself.
You can't blame her for being pleased with her bit of success.
It will be over soon.
I wonder how the big stars live through it.
The world at their feet? It must be a glorious feeling for a little while.
A heady feeling.
Well, she's become a top recording artist.
Robert tells me they're today's new nobility.
Strange that none of us thought of this.
-Mr. Gaston?
-Mr. Gaston.
We've used up our last tire.
-You sisters must be rough on rubber heels.
-Well--
Help yourselves.
Glad to get them out of the way.
You're very kind.
Oh, this is best.
-Thank you.
-Thank you.
Now, you watch me.
Good, bravo. Look at that.
Hey, look. It's Sister.
Dom, come back here.
-Hello, Sister.
-Dominic, what are you doing out so late?
Piet invited us.
He's a rich sailor.
Why don't you let him buy you a drink?
- No, thank you.
- Come on, Dom.
- Just a minute, Nicole.
- Go back to the table, Dom.
Go on!
Why is Dominic with you in this place and in such company?
They're my friends. Where do you think he ought to be, home alone?
Home, with you.
You have a duty to your brother.
And it's late for a girl your age to be out too.
You're out pretty late yourself, Sister.
If you must go out, you can always leave him with me.
-He'll be safe, then.
-He's safe with me.
- I don't think so.
- 1 think it's time we left, Sister.
I'm taking Dominic with me.
- Oh, no, you're not. He's staying with me.
- Dominic?
I said, I think it's time we left,
Sister. There's nothing you can do here.
That's right. You tell her, Sister.
He's my brother.
What are you gonna do about it?
-Here. Go on, have a puff.
-No, thank you.
Go on, take a try.
Well, what got into you?
More letters, Mother.
-They're all for Sister Ann.
-Well, set them over there, Sister.
May I come in, Mother?
What is all this?
I believe it's called fan mail.
That is wonderful. Marvelous.
And I bring more good news.
I have with me a very important gentleman who's waiting to see you.
Mr. Ed Sullivan.
Who is he?
Millions of people in America watch him every Sunday night on television.
Well, that need not concern us here.
-Excuse me, Mother.
-But--
But the convent in Copenhagen wired to ask for 20 more albums.
Where do you want these?
There. Don't bring any more until we find room for them.
Mother, he has come over 3000 miles just to have a few words with you.
-Didn't you get the letter about his arrival?
-We haven't had time to open our mail.
-Nevertheless--
-Excuse me.
Three busloads of boys from Saint Stephen's have arrived.
They want to sing their school song for Sister Ann.
I'll see them later.
Mother, please, Mr. Sullivan--
Well, I suppose it wouldn't be very courteous not to see the gentleman...
...if he's traveled so many miles.
Mr. Sullivan, Mr. Fitzpatrick...
...I'm sure you didn't come all the way from New York to Belgium just to visit me.
So my I ask why, even though I think
I can guess the answer?
I'm quite certain, Mother, you're not familiar with our TV show in America.
Well, you're right, Mr. Sullivan.
I'm afraid I'm not familiar with it.
-It's a very clean, family-type show.
-Oh, very nice.
To get to the point, Mother...
...we'd like to present on our show your Sister Ann.
But why, Mr. Sullivan?
People can hear her on records.
But they'd like to see her.
And honestly, if you'd give us permission...
...I can assure you that we'll present her in all dignity and respect.
Well, I wish to thank you, Mr. Sullivan.
And I regret that I must answer in the negative.
Well, just one favor.
Could I meet her? Because when I go home
I would like to say that I had met her.
Well, of course, Mr. Sullivan.
Come this way, won't you?
Can I help you, Sister Cluny?
Over there, Mr. Sullivan.
Sister Ann, this is a very great pleasure.
-Oh, no. Down there, Mr. Sullivan.
-Oh.
Sister Ann, this is indeed a great pleasure.
I'm a great fan of yours.
My name is Ed Sullivan.
I come from New York.
And I'm here to ask you to sing on our television show.
New York?
-I'd like that.
-Of course I told him no.
Oh, and I regret that, Mother, because our cardinal in New York had proposed...
...perhaps we get something for your order that would be badly needed.
Oh, we could have used a jeep,
Mr. Sullivan.
Particularly when we reopen our Africa missions.
I was thinking of several jeeps, Father.
Several jeeps?
It would be a great help if a jeep could've been delivered to our mission.
-One or two? Or three?
-Sure.
One is all we will need, Mr. Sullivan.
-Thank you, Mother.
-And thank you, Mr. Sullivan.
Excuse me, miss, what's the voltage here?
I had no idea putting on a television show was anything like this, Mr. Sullivan.
May I, please?
My only theatrical experience was when I directed a Passion play in Bruges.
-This must be quite a contrast, Father.
-Oh, yes, and very exhilarating.
Max.
They look too white. They're like spooks.
Can't you put something on them?
That lady says nix. No makeup.
No makeup.
- Hi.
- I am sorry, children.
-Do you mind, Father?
-Hm?
Oh, I'm sorry.
- Okay, Mr. Sullivan?
- Okay, Fitz.
-All right, girls, if you'll take your places.
-Mr. Fitzpatrick, please. Sisters, not girls.
Oh, thank you, miss.
All right, Sisters, right this way.
There you are. If you'll get on the stool.
Fine.
May I, Sister?
Thank you.
No, it's too much white.
Do you sisters have any change of clothing?
Something dark blue, perhaps?
No? Well, I guess we're stuck with the white.
- What about the lights?
- Okay.
Ready, Mr. Sullivan.
-Yes, Fitz.
-Stand by. Quiet.
Five, four, three, two.
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
Tonight is a very special feature...
...of this very special show.
From Belgium, we are going to bring you the voice...
...of a very dedicated young woman who composes and sings her own songs.
So now, ladies and gentlemen, here is The Singing Nun, Sister Ann.
Dominique, nique, nique
1 will tell of Dominique
His goodness to acclaim
And I pray the song I sing
Will some simple pleasure bring
That the world shall know his name
1 will tell of Dominique
As I sing this little song
And when [I sing the chorus
All the world will sing along
Dominique, nique, nique
It was good Saint Dominique
He lived for you and me
From the labors long ago
Came a better world I know
And his love shall always be
Though I'm poor, said Dominique
As he spoke unto the Lord
I will be your humble servant
And your love is my reward
Dominique, nique, nique
1 will follow Dominique
His burdens will I share
For his courage will I pray
His teachings to obey
His words shall be my prayer
By the kindness of his heart
And the labor of his hand
He brought love and understanding
As he wandered through the land
Dominique, nique, nique
1 will tell of Dominique
His goodness to acclaim
And I pray the song I sing
Will some simple pleasure bring
All the world shall know his name
Dominique the mighty warrior
Was a soldier of the Lord
His armor was devotion
And the gospel was his sword
Dominique, nique, nique
It was good Saint Dominique
He lived for you and me
From his labors long ago
Came a better world I know
And his love shall always be
Through the blazing heat of summer
And the chill of winter snow
1 will follow Dominique
In his footsteps I will go
Dominique, nique, nique
1 will follow Dominique
His burdens will I share
For his courage will I pray
His teachings to obey
His words shall be my prayer
-Oh, Sister Ann.
-It was really beautiful.
It was beautiful.
Well, we must be sure to thank Mr. Gerarde for making it possible for us to see this.
It was really very kind of him, wasn't it?
But now it is over and we must get back to our work...
...which has suffered a bit.
Not that a little luxury isn't good for the human spirit once in a while...
...but in small doses.
Too many luxuries can become as everyday and as expected...
...as, well, Sister Cluny's nightly stew.
So, daughters, let us be thankful that tonight...
...Samaritan House will be once more in repose.
She's forgotten we promised to be at Primavera to sign those papers.
May the Lord keep thy soul
May the Lord keep thy coming in
And thy going out
From henceforth now and forever
I want to talk to Sister Ann.
Well, she's not here just now.
May I help you?
It's got to be her.
I'm sorry, but she's in Bruges.
Some business about her recordings.
-We expect her back later tonight.
-That won't help.
Well, Sister Ann isn't the only nun here.
I'm quite willing to help if I knew what you wanted.
I only wanted her because Dom likes her.
My father's been dragged off.
Dom's all alone.
Hell, forget it!
Wait.
-Wait.
-"You can always leave him with me."
That's what she said.
"I want to help you. I'll pray for you."
All that bunk.
Where is she when you need her?
-But she isn't the only nun here. I'll take--
-1 didn't come for anyone else.
You're a stranger to Dom.
She tells him stories. What could you do?
-Well, I can tell him stories. I can--
-I'm gonna take him with me.
I don't need her. I don't need any of you.
Dominic?
-There doesn't seem to be anyone--
-Someone's in there.
Dominic? It's Sister Ann.
Dominic?
Open the door, dear.
I'm so glad.
Dominic, have you been here all alone?
Oh, your hands are like ice.
Nicole said you couldn't come.
Well, I came as soon as I could.
Oh, my. Now--
-Oh, God bless you.
-God bless you too.
Feeling better?
-Where's your father, Dominic?
-In jail.
And Nicole, where did she go?
To work. We didn't have any money.
Well, you were very brave to stay all by yourself.
I know. Is there any more?
Well, let's see what we can find.
Well, that won't do.
Oh, there's nothing in here but two big brown B-U-G-S.
Dead, thank goodness.
Oh, we have a lot of them here.
That settles it. He can't stay here.
How'd you like to spend the night at Samaritan House?
-We'll put a cot in the big room downstairs.
-All right.
I'll get his things ready.
His pajamas and whatever else he needs.
I sleep naked.
I did too when I was your age.
Very well, then. He'll need a sweater.
I'll leave a note for Nicole so she won't worry about you.
It's all right.
What are you gonna say?
"Dom will stay with us...
...until you call for him.
I promise to take good care of him,
Nicole...
...so do not worry.
He is safe with me. Sister Ann."
-Good.
-Good.
Down.
Up.
-Down.
-That's my place.
Down, up, down.
All together now.
Oh, how I wish I were a Pied Piper
I'd play a happy song
Sing, Michel.
When I dance down the street
The children would follow
And sing as we go along
Very good.
Everybody come.
Who wants to be the Pied Piper?
-All right, Dom. You be the Pied Piper.
-I'm the Pied Piper. Everyone follow me.
And when the grownups
Heard the little children
Sing the Pied Piper's song
Then maybe they'd learn
To love one another
And sing as we go along
Oh, Mrs. Bouchet, please, the gate must remain closed at all times.
Oh, I'm sorry, Sister. Run along, Rene.
Come, Rene, you're late. Come on.
Who's first?
Slide down. I'll catch you.
There she is, Robert.
Come on, Dominic, that's a boy.
I want to try it too.
Whee. Oops. Oh.
Thank you, dear.
Whoo!
-Robert!
-You're surprised to see me.
I came to tell the famous Singing Nun...
...that Primavera wants to send her on a world tour.
-You must be joking.
-No.
-Can we talk somewhere without the music?
-Oh, yes.
Children, play by yourselves for a while.
-Dom, you're still the Pied Piper.
-Right.
-So, Pied Piper, pipe.
-Right.
Rats and mice, follow Dominic.
Think of it, Lucienne.
Paris, London, New York,
California, Japan.
All those wonderful places.
And doing what you like to do best, singing.
With Sister Adele, singing all around the wide, wide world.
But, of course, I cannot go.
-Why can't you go?
-Because my life is here.
I admit you had this wonderful dedication.
You tried it and I respect that.
But things have changed.
You have a chance for a life in the world.
Is the good you do for a handful worth more than what you'd do for millions as a singer?
-l can't listen.
-Let me finish.
Take a close look at what you do as a nun.
Taking care of other women's children?
My God, what a waste.
You should be having children of your own.
The children.
Dom.
I didn't see him until the last minute.
He ran right in front of me.
- No, no, don't move him, Sister Ann.
- I didn't mean to.
-Call an ambulance. Quickly.
-Yes, Father.
With you, I shall walk--
With you--
Father?
Any word?
Then we keep praying, huh?
I've been trying to pray, Father.
But I cannot.
It was an accident.
You mustn't blame yourself.
Can't pray?
No. I've tried.
Father, I need your help.
God deserved better from me, but I've given him nothing.
What have I given anyone?
Your songs, your music. Don't you think you've won a great victory through them?
What kind of victory, Father, if I've lost myself winning it?
I am a priest.
That means, I suppose, that I should be able to give you some answers.
You see, I pray with this in my hand.
Oh, it means a great deal to me.
How much does your music mean to you?
It was a friend, a gift from God.
I sang to him with my guitar.
But I used it for my own glory.
My own importance.
I liked being made a fuss over, Father,
I like being The Singing Nun...
...who could make millions.
And I cheapened his gift and he's taken it from me.
He's taken nothing from you.
He's not a vengeful God, Sister.
-Then why can I not pray now?
-You can pray.
If there is anything I know in this life, everyone can pray.
You are praying right now.
No, I'm not.
I'm not and I have not been.
Oh, Father, can't you see?
I've been living half in one world...
...and half in another and I'm lost.
Lost between them.
I've been aware of that.
Do you want to leave the convent?
No.
You answer so quickly. Think.
And don't expect anyone else to make that decision for you.
That decision was made long ago.
Father, when you see Robert, would you give him a message for me?
Of course.
Will you--?
Will you tell him I hope...
...his life will be fulfilled?
And what about your life?
Make certain, Sister Ann, search your heart.
Thank you, Father.
What have I done to you?
What have I done to you?
Amen.
Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee.
Blessed art thou amongst women.
Blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.
Holy Mary, mother of God...
...pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death.
Holy Mary, mother of God, pray for us sinners now and at the hour of--
Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you, God.
Thank you.
Sister, guess what.
I can leave my cast on for another whole week.
-You must have a very nice doctor.
-Yes.
I came to say goodbye, Mr. Arlien.
Yes, I guess you heard we were leaving this town.
We're going to my grandma's.
She has a farm and a pig and everything.
Oh, pigs are lovely.
Yes.
We'll be all right now, Sister. I--
I think there's enough man left in me to give him what he needs...
...and to get from him what I need.
I'm glad for you and Dom and Nicole.
I don't think the fresh air and the fresh life appeal to her.
I wanted to say goodbye to you alone.
I wanted to tell you how sorry I am about what happened to Dom.
You won't have to worry about him anymore.
You won't have to worry about any of us.
We'll be out in the country with the pigs.
You'll like it there.
-Is that what you came to tell me?
-Yes.
Well, you've told me. Goodbye.
I haven't been much of a friend to you,
Nicole.
You always thought I interfered.
Perhaps I did.
But I care what happens to you...
...and wherever you go or I may go,
I will always care what happens to you.
Why?
Why should you care? No one else does.
Because we're so much alike.
You see, I've been bewildered and confused and frightened too.
Then you know I've been blaming you for everything.
I should have been taking care of him...
...but I left him alone because I wanted to go out.
I was sick of him. I was sick of this place.
I was sick of everything.
I wanted to have some fun.
Oh, God, Sister, fun!
That's all over, Nicole.
Things will be different for you now.
Better, happier.
Do you really believe that?
Yes, I do. Completely.
Well, they're waiting for me.
Nicole, before you go...
...I want to give you this.
Your guitar, Sister?
I don't know how to play.
It doesn't matter.
I wanted to give you something.
It's all I have. Please take it.
And when you feel all alone, it may speak to you as it did to me...
...and remind you that God is with you, always.
-Let me have that bag, Sister.
-Oh, thank you.
Goodbye, Sister.
Goodbye, Dom.
I want my name to be Dominic now.
Then goodbye, Dominic.
Goodbye, Mr. Arlien.
Goodbye, Sister.
Robert, you didn't have to come in the back door.
-Next time, try coming in the front, huh?
-I'll do that.
-Do you mind?
-No.
How's the recording business?
That record you persuaded me to make,
Father.
It opened up a whole new world to me.
If I'd have known it would end like this,
I'd have turned you down.
If I'd have seen my own part in it, there would have been no deal.
I've decided I am a priest, not a promoter.
I can't even find her.
She's left my life as abruptly as she reentered it.
I've been to the Samaritan House.
They told me she was not there.
That's all they would say.
Do you know where she is?
I know she's happy.
Isn't that the greatest thing a man can wish for someone he loves?
Oh, I know, it is more gratifying to think that he brings the happiness.
But for some, joy is a bird soaring upwards.
It cannot be earthbound.
Will you accept this, Robert?
If only I could be certain the choice were her own.
It was.
Please realize and respect the fact that she closed the doors between you, herself.
Thank you, Father.
Spoon next to the knife.
Spoon next to the knife.
Spoon next to the knife.
Sisters?
A letter from Sister Ann.
-Sister Ann?
-Yes, Sister Ann.
A very quick worker, great help to me in the kitchen.
Sets a beautiful table.
Spoon next to the knife.
- Sisters.
- Well, shall I read it now?
Yes, please.
Thank you.
"Dear Mother, dear Sisters:
The schoolbooks you sent arrived and were most welcome."
Oh, good. And we were so worried.
"And while I still have some difficulty with the dialect...
...l try to teach in the language of sympathy...
...which is understood by all.
We travel many miles every day to visit remote villages.
We start very early in the morning...
...because Africa is a country where everybody...
...and everything starts early.
We travel long hours through a beautiful country...
...along dirt roads, carrying a heavy load of supplies.
And we pray for Mr. Ed Sullivan every day for giving us our most prized possession...
...the intrepid Dominique.
Every day in this wonderful land holds its own surprises.
And we're learning to accept them gracefully.
I feel we're beginning to establish a wonderful rapport everywhere we go.
And I can assure you that we're making many fast friends.
We've set up small clinics.
And the villagers give us such a warm welcome...
...that we no longer feel like strangers."
Gemini to ground control.
Reading you loud and clear.
Liftoff smooth.
Ready for checklist.
Fuel is go,
1.2 "G" cabin, 14 P.S.I.
Oxygen is go. Telemetry is go. All systems go.
Thank you. Thank you.
Control! Control!
I have a red on meteorite warning.
Meteorite warning!
Meteorite.!
We are now passing through a meteorite field.
You will undoubtedly hear small meteorites peppering the outer skin of the capsule.
Small meteorites are peppering the outer skin of the capsule!
Meteorites.!
Meteorites.!
Meteorite light off.
Nothing to be afraid of, kids.
We are now passing over the Hawaiian Islands.
Our flight plan will carry us to the recovery area 100 miles southeast of the Bahamas.
We are starting our retrorocket countdown.
Five, four... three, two, one.
Firing retrorockets-rockets.
We will be touching down in 20 minutes.
I have to go to the bathroom.
We have just touched down.
Everybody, out. Mary first.
Come on, Mary.
Bye, Mr. Spaceman.
Okay, bye.
Bye, Mr. Spaceman.
He can't stand heights.
I enjoyed the ride,
Mr. Spaceman.
Ned!
You got me?
Gotcha. Gotcha.
Easy. Easy.
Steady, now.
One more step.
Atta boy. Now, you're on the ground.
I'll be back in a minute, Ned.
Bye, and thank you,
Mr. Spaceman.
Oh, anytime, honey.
Hi, Ellie.
Hi, Roy. How's it goin'?
Oh, I had to cut the orbit short.
A personnel problem.
I know. I helped her with her buttons. Ah, well.
How's everything in the soft drink game?
Fine.
Oh, that's cold.
Cold hands, warm heart.
You, uh... You're lookin' mighty pretty today, Ellie.
Thank you, Roy.
Beauty is as beauty does.
You got that look in your eye again. What look?
That crazy basset hound look.
Well, flattery'll get you everywhere.
Oh, Roy.
Guess what, Ellie?
Hmm?
A bunch of us were standin' around the corner... in front of the drug store last night, and guess what?
- What?
- Well, a lot of'em were sayin' that it's... gettin' kinda obvious that... I got a crush on you.
Oh, Roy, would you hand me that scouring pad, please?
Sigmund Crane said I'd crawl a mile over broken glass just to get a kiss from you.
Sigmund Crane drinks too much.
Well, even so...
"I think that
I shall never see... a poem so lovely as a tree, a tree that..."
Roy, when you're trying to be romantic, you don't recite poems about trees.
Excuse me while
I throw out the trash.
Scouring pad.
To each his own.
Got another load, Roy.
Smart aleck.
Uh, listen, Ellie, I gotta go. Will you please go out with me tonight?
I can't really, Roy. Oh, come on,
I've been askin' you for months.
Well, l... It's Saturday night.
We'll make a big evening out of it.
First, we have dinner right here. Then we take a little walk through the park.
And then over to your place and watch that George Raft movie on television.
Let's go, Roy.! What do you say, Ellie? It's Saturday night.
I've gotta stay late tonight and take inventory. I'll come by here.
All right, Roy.
Until tonight, cherie.
Everything A-Okay, crew? Yes, Mr. Spaceman.
Okay, board the spacecraft.
Be careful.
Roy.! Roy.!
You're wanted on the telephone.
I'll be right back, Ned.
It's your mother.
She sounds excited.
Hello? Hello!
Hello, Ma?
Yes, well...
Right away?
We're right in the middle...
Well, wha... Okay,
I'll be home right away.
Bye, bye.
I'll see you later, Ellie.
I gotta get home right away.
Take over, will ya, Ned? Check.
Oww, Suzie!
Oh, Royal! Oh, Royal, your father has really done it this time.
What'd he do?
Roy, sit down.
You better brace yourself.
What? What is it?
You remember when your father sent that application into the government?
You mean the one for me to be an astronaut?
We don't have to worry about that.
We have to worry about it now,
Roy, because they have accepted you.
What?
It says so right there.
It says that they have accepted you as a WB-1074.
Your father took one look at that and then he ran outdoors... and he's telling everybody in town about it.
An astronaut?
Me? An astronaut? I can't even get up on the chair to get the marmalade.
- Oh, my poor boy.
- Why is Pa always tryin' to run my life?
Well, after all, he was a corporal in World
War I and you know how bossy they were.
But, Ma, that war's been over for ages.
Not to your father. He loves that war as much today as he did then.
An astronaut?
Me? An astronaut?
Oh, I should've studied up more on fear of heights and things when you were young.
I'm so tired of Pa thinkin' he's still in the army and orderin' me around.
Burt Lancaster was terribly afraid of the water... and today, he is a movie star.
Look, Ma,
I'm 35 years old!
Okay, so I do live at home. I still don't have to do everything he tells me!
Burt was the most unforgettable character that month.
Well, I'll tell you something right now, Ma! I've had it! H-A-D, had it!
And the minute he comes in that door, I'm gonna tell him, "No soap! I'm not goin'!"
Hi, Mother. Roy!
Roy! Roy! Roy.
Roy, ya made it, boy!
Ya made it!
My boy, an astronaut.
Hey, the whole town knows it, Roy.
Your name is on every tongue in town.
They're all sayin' it:
"Buck Fleming's boy, astronaut!"
Royal has something to tell you, Arbuckle.
Oh, yeah, that's right,
Pa, I do. Well, shoot.
Well, maybe you better sit down. Ah.
Go ahead, Roy.
Get it off your chest.
Well, Pa... Ya know, I stopped by the paper. Gave them the whole story.
Pa, you're not listenin'.
Huh?
I hate to tell you this, but most of the time when I talk to you, you don't listen.
I don't listen? Got something you wanna tell me right now? Yeah, I have!
Well, go ahead.
I'm listenin' to every word.
Well, okay, now, i-it's like this.
Now, it isn't because
I don't love you, because I do.
You heard that, Mother?
And that's what makes it all the harder to tell you.
Now, you see, I'm not really cut out for this astronaut thing... because in the first place,
I've always had a fear of heights... and to tell you the truth, I don't think you've ever been aware of that.
The boy loves his father.
You heard him say that?
- Yes, I did Arbuckle.
- Mother, please!
Pa, I know how proud you are and I know what all this means...
Hello-oo. Plank?
Plank. Plank.
Yeah, isn't that somethin'?
My boy, an astronaut.
Yeah, he leaves tomorrow. Hey, why don't you come over after supper. We'll celebrate.
Right.
That was Plank Woodman.
He's comin' over later. We'll have a little nip and celebrate.
Let me say what I have to say! Say away, boy.
Well...
Hello. Rush. Rush!
Yeah, isn't he somethin'?
Well, he's right here now.
We're havin'a real heart-to-heart talk.
Rush says, "Congrats."
Right. Why don't ya come over later?
We'll celebrate.
Right. Go ahead, boy.
Now, look, Pa. I think it's time we faced the fact that I'm 35 years old...
and I have a say in my own life!
Hello! Uh...
It's for you, Mother.
Mother, for pete's sake, is that all you do, talk on the phone?
Now, doggone it! I can never say what I wanna say! Now, Roy.
No, now I'm gonna say it! You're getting all keyed up. You need a nap.
No, I don't need a nap!
Ten-hut!
Right face!
Forward, march!
Hut, two, three, four!
Column, left, march!
Pa, I'm 35 years old.
Oh, I met a girl in gay Paris
Parlez vous
I met a girl in gay Paris
Parlez vous
I met a girl in gay Paris
Oh, what a mess she made of me
Inky, dinky parlez vous

The colonel got the Croix de guerre There's the boy!
Hi, Pa. Come on in and see the boys.
I got a date, Pa.
Come on. Come on.
Roy! Roy!
Congratulations.
A-Okay, there.
The boy's got a date.
Who's the lucky dame?
Oh, EllieJackson.
The hot dog girl, huh?
Say, she's quite a dish. Too bad you didn't come in for a haircut, Roy.
I've been kinda busy, Bert.
We're doggone proud of you.
You should be. Roy, do us a countdown.
Huh? Do us a countdown!
Come on, Roy, just this once. Come on.
Please, Roy, just one time?
Well...
Five, four... three, two, one.
Aw, terrific!
A toast! You do the honors, Rush.
Give us one of your good ones.
To Roy Fleming: a credit to his town...
to his father, to his nation... and now, the entire universe!
Hear, hear.
Well, l...
I guess
I better be goin'.
I can't keep the little lady waitin'.
Kiss the girls and make 'em cry, boy. Love 'em and leave 'em.
Bye, don't worry.
Roy! Boys.
To the next man to die.
Hi, Ellie. Roy. Oh, I forgot all about you.
My mother called and I think she's got the flu. I'm gonna have to rush home.
That's a shame.
Have you heard?
Heard what? Oh, what time does the drug store close?
Oh, 7:00 or 8:00 or around there.
But you mean you really haven't heard?
I can't understand that. It's all over town. What a day. What a day.
Well, see, what happened was my-my father sent in this application for me... about a month ago... Tell me about it tomorrow. I'm in an awfully big hurry.
Well, there won't be any tomorrow. I'm sorry about the date.
Yeah, but, Ellie, you see...
Ellie, I'm gonna be an astronaut!
I'm gonna be an astronaut.
Have you got your ticket,
Roy? Yeah, I got it right here.
I've never been out to the airport before. This is all new in through here.
Yeah, it seems like only yesterday this was all beets as far as the eye could see.
You got your ticket now, Roy?
Yeah, I got it right there.
A-Okay, there.
Missouri Trunk Lines super deluxe twin engine flight number one...
Well, that's me.
Got your ticket, Roy?
Yeah, got it right here.
Roy.
Passengers all aboard, please.
Over the top.
Right, Pa.
Well, good-bye, everybody.
You got your ticket?
Yeah.
I don't have my ticket.
Haven't got your ticket?
Oh, here...
Here it is.
Oh. I was kinda hopin' it was lost.
Well, maybe you can tell the pilot not to drive too high. Well...
Bye, Ma.
Roy.
Ellie! I almost didn't make it. I just heard about it this morning.
Oh, well, I tried to tell you last night.
I realize that now, and I'm sorry, Roy. Heck, that's all right.
I mean, listen...
Flight number one.
Passengers all aboard, please.
All aboard. Well, I guess I gotta go now. l... I'm... Well, it was real swell of you to come out, Ellie.
Will you write to me? Oh, yeah, sure will. Yeah, I'll do that.
Well, bye, everybody.
Bye, Roy.
He's a real Fleming, Mother.
Give you a lift? Oh, sure. Thanks.
Hop in.
Fred Gifford. Where're ya headed?
Roy Fleming. Personnel office.
I gotta go up there and check in.
I've been on a bus since...
Fred Gifford!
That's right.
Hey, Fred Gifford!
Boy, I saw your flight on Channel 11 last week.
They wouldn't let you stay up two more orbits, would they? Well, orders are orders.
Fred Gifford.
Boy, you were one of those guys that's been right up there into space.
And I'm sittin' right on the same seat with ya.
Mind if I touch ya?
You're gonna be working at the Space Center? Yeah.
Mind if I ask you a couple of questions? Go ahead.
Well, when you shoot off, do ya faint or black out or anything?
Oh, no, no. You take a couple of"G's", but not enough to make you faint.
Oh, it sounds awful. About how high in the sky do you drive that thing?
Anywhere from 90 to a couple hundred miles.
I bet you wouldn't look down for a million dollars. Sure, it's a beautiful sight.
Never get me to look down.
I don't care how darn beautiful it is.
Reentry's what rough. Suddenly, you just start to drop there.
And you're sitting backwards, wondering if that drogue chute...
is ever gonna open and you're falling and falling and falling.
That's enough.
Don't say anymore.
Makes me dizzy just to think about it.
That's the personnel office over there. Oh, well, thanks a lot.
By the way, whatcha gonna be doing? I'm gonna be an astronaut.
Yes, sir?
I'd like a cup of coffee, please.
That all you're having? I'm gonna go into the astronaut training program... and I'm not really sure what I'm supposed to eat yet.
Attention.
Will all astronauts report immediately to Building 9-G.
Oh.
Oop. Ah.
I have to go. Oh, where's Building
9-G? Down the walk out front.
Cut through the docking simulator building, then right. You can't miss it.
Oh, uh...
Those are my S-H-O-R-T-S.
See, what happened was I was, uh, going down the hall there and...
I'm a new astronaut and I was looking for Building 9-G.
All new personnel report to the personnel office. The loudspeaker...
Are you new here?
Very.
All new personnel report to the personnel office. The personnel office!
Thank you.
Roy Fleming to the desk, please.
Roy Fleming, please.
I'm Roy Fleming.
Donelli.
Your man Fleming,
Donelli.
You'll go with Mr. Donelli. Mm-hmm.
Oh, I had a little trouble with my underwear.
I mean, the bag over in the...
Follow me!
Mm-hmm.
Captain.
Donelli.
Fleming!
Gee, Mr. Donelli, I don't think I'd ever be able to do anything like that.
Don't worry.
You'll never have to.
This is your locker. Oh, yeah. Fleming.
Right.
Here you are.
In the mornings, you sweep all locker area and boiler room.
In the afternoons, you wet down and mop.
Now, the tops of the lockers should be kept... clean at all times.
They'll be inspected by me personally daily at 1700 hours.
Now, in the morning...
Excuse me, sir? Uh...
Is this all sort of like a part of a training program?
- What training program?
- You know... space.
This is your space, from there to there.
And I expect you to keep it clean, Fleming.
Now, then... You mean, l-l-l... I'm a janitor?
Why, of course not.
My boy, you are WB-1074, apprentice janitor.
I expect you every morning at 8:00 sharp.
Ajanitor.
I'm a janitor!
Ajanitor.
Oh, Pa.
Operator. Operator, I'd like to call Sweetwater, Missouri.
That's Sweetwater-7143.
Just a moment please.
That will be one dollar for three minutes, please.
Thank you.
Hello.
Hello, Ma, it's me, Roy. I'm here and
I'm not an astronaut. I'm a janitor.
This is the Sweetwater operator.
Here is your party. Uh, Ma?
That you, Roy?
You phonin' long distance?
Oh, hi, Pa.
Yeah, listen, Pa.
We expected to hear from you earlier, if your plane got there on time.
Well, they had to put in a couple of extra rest stops on account of a lady.
How are ya, boy?
Are you okay?
Everybody here's talkin' about you. They're all sayin'...
They're sayin', "Looky there, there goes
Buck Fleming, father of the astronaut."
Yeah, well, listen, Pa, there's something I gotta tell you.
And I bet I know what it is too. You wanna thank me for putting in your application.
Shucks, son, that's what pa's are for: to put in applications.
Pa, will ya listen for a minute?
You're usin' up too much money on the telephone, Roy. Bye, now.
But, Pa...
Over the top.
Pa!
Notice how important it is to conserve your strength, gentlemen.
Excessive breathing has resulted in clouding of the face mask... impairing the vision.
Keep in mind that old third law of Professor Newton:
"For every action, there is an opposite and equal reaction."
A dirty floor is a bad floor.
Especially when you go to wax it.
Now, you have got to clean it first.
If you don't clean it, then, brother, what you've got is trouble.
Now, take a close look at the trouble this man is having.
This, gentlemen, is the Zlobnik.
To the best of our knowledge, it is the Russian counterpart to our...
fully automated personnel capsule, the Eclipse.
Intelligence tells us that they're getting pretty close to a launch date.
That's why we're accelerating your training schedule. Please bear with us.
Well, I don't think I've got anything else. Oh, yes, Major Gifford?
I'd like to see you and the rest of the "A" team in the training hangar for a press photo...
in five minutes.
Yes, sir.
Now, this here is our new
Jiffy Super 120-C.
And if you don't think it's important, remember this:
A grain of dust in the wrong place... could wreck the entire space program.
That's all for now.
Get to your stations.
- Oh, Fleming!
- Oh, yes, sir?
Fleming, you've been here two weeks now... and I don't think your mind has been on your work for one second!
Well, to tell you the truth, my heart really isn't in this.
We are not interested in your heart,
Fleming. We want your elbow grease.!
Well, you see, when I came here, this isn't exactly what... Fleming.
You're a disgrace to Maintenance Engineering.
Did you get your new
Jiffy? No, sir, I didn't.
Take mine.
Thank you, sir.
That's the greatest little mop in the world, Fleming. Use it properly.
Yes, sir. Roy! Fleming.
I'm sorry.
You're impossible!
Oh, I'm sorry.
Oh, l-l... I'm sorry...
I'm sorry, Major.
No sweat.
I didn't see you comin'. Forget about it. What's the deal? You with maintenance?
Oh, uh, well, uh... That's kind of an involved story there.
Yeah, I can imagine. What happened? Well... remember when I told you I was gonna be an astronaut? Yeah, yeah.
Well, you see, my father, uh...
Oh, you wouldn't wanna hear about that. No, no, go ahead.
Well, I got this letter from the Space Agency...
Say a couple of you fellas in the back move down in the front here.
And perhaps this tall man can move to the rear. And also, the front row kneel.
So, ya see, I'm livin' a lie. Everybody in Sweetwater thinks I'm an astronaut.
I can't sleep. I can't eat. I'm gettin' thin.
Don't let it throw you, pappy. It'll all work out.
There he is.
That's him all right.
Buck Fleming's boy.
A-Okay, there.
Doggone it, Buck, you did it again!
I always give Uncle Sam the best I got.
I did it in '18 and I'm doin' it now.
E Pluribus Unum.!
Say, Buck, how come
Roy's holdin' a mop?
You don't think they're gonna put that kind of information in the paper, do you?
Oh, clever government.
E Pluribus Unum.! You better believe it.
A- okay, there, Roy.
Fleming to Control. Fleming to Control. How do you read me?
Loud and clear!
You realize you are smoking inside an expensive piece of equipment? Sorry, sir.
You're sorry, sir? Here's your mail. Yes, sir.
You got five minutes to read it, and then get busy. Understand? Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Hi, Roy.
Oh, hi, Major.
Well, this has just gone too far.
It's just gone too far.
Oh, I gotta stop this.
Mr. Donelli, uh...
Mr. Donelli, I uh...
I have to have a little time off? Time off?
You've only been here three weeks. I know that.
But, you see, uh... Well...
There's a little matter back home.
See, something has, uh...
Well, it's kind of an emergency, actually.
What it is is, uh...
My father's son is in trouble.
- Your father's son? You mean your brother?
- No, he's an only child.
Look, what are ya talkin' about?
The man obviously has a problem,
Donelli. Why don't you let him go?
Well, if it's uh... If it's an emergency, but don't take too long.
Oh, no, no. A day or two will be plenty. Thank you, Mr. Donelli.
Thank you.
He gets very excited. Oh, you just can't get good help anymore.
Hiya, boy.
Hi, Pa.
Got your wire. Couldn't wait for you to get here. Couldn't wait!
Well, I'm here.
Of course you are.
Come on in.
Let me look at you.
Ah, you look great.
Oh, well. Hard as nails. Brown as a berry.
Let me feel that arm.
It's a whole new arm.
Well, uh... Uh...
Listen, Pa, the reason I came home is there's something I gotta tell you.
I bet you got a million things you wanna tell me. Yeah, that's true.
But there's one thing in particular, Pa. You see, the...
Ten-hut!
No, no, no, Pa.
Come on, get those shoulders back. Pa...
Suck in that gut!
Pass in review!
Surprise!
Oh, kiss your Uncle Roy.
Oh. Oh, I'll never wash her face again.
Remember me?
Well, sure, Aunt Zana.
I used to change his didies.
I remember.
Frieda Wilcox.
Oh, Frieda Wilcox, for heaven sakes, sixth grade.
What's the capital of Wisconsin?
Uh, capital of Wisconsin?
Pingo remembers him.
Look. Oh, Pingo remembers Roy.
Oh, yeah,
I remember Pingo too.
Let the mother through, folks.
Let the mother through. Oh, Roy!
Oh, Ma. Oh, it's so nice to have you home, son.
- Well, it's nice to be home, Ma.
- My boy is home, Mother.
I see that, Arbuckle. Back off, everybody. Back off.
I wanna get a picture of
Roy and Buck together. Well.
Put your arm around him, Buck. Ah.
All right, smile, smile.
Somebody say money.
That'll make 'em smile.
One, two, three.
A-Okay, there. Hi, Plank. How are ya?
Is Ellie here?
She'll be along soon.
I used to change his didies.
Here comes the cake.
Oh, Clara, that is just marvelous. Come on.
That's a space cake for ya.
Roy, you have to cut the first piece.
Well, all right. Hold it,
Roy. I wanna get a picture.
Oh, well wait, honey.
All right.
Wait. You're just a little too sweet.
All right. All right.
Mother.
Everybody smile.
One, two, three.
Oh.
Cut the cake, Roy.
Yeah.
Oh, Roy, wait! I forgot.
We have a little surprise for you.
Your nieces, Karen...
and Lorna and Nancy and Darlene... have made up a little song just for you.
Well, bless their hearts. All right, girls.
"The Song Of Space," dedicated to Uncle Roy.
They wrote it theirselves.
Up and down, around and around
Up and down we go
Here and there, around the air
Satellites aglow
We will flit in orbit
Spinning out in space
Roy, Roy, atta boy
You are no disgrace
That's Roy.!
They're so sweet.
They're so sweet.
I used to change his didies.
Roy, you better cut the cake.
Roy, before you do... how about doin' a countdown for us?
Do a countdown for us.
Everybody wants to hear it.
Come on, Tiger.
Just one time.
Go on, do it, Roy.
Well.
Five, four...
three, two, one.
Oh, that was beautiful.
You're the greatest.
Cut the cake.
Oh, yeah.
Well... let's see.
Right down the center.
Pingo wants to see the cake.
Let Pingo see the cake.
My cake!
Look at Pingo!
Look at him.
He loves cake.
Ooh! How dare you!
Come with Mama.
We'll get away.
Hey.
Uh, cake, anyone?
I think I'll just have some coffee.
He only tasted one piece of it!
Oh, I hate Pekingese!
You never know what they're thinking.
I guess you have a lot of technical equipment up there, right, Roy?
Technical equipment. You wanna talk about technical equipment, huh?
Well, I'll tell you about your technical equipment.
That place is just full of great big things. Oh.
What about them stimulators?
Oh, Plank.
Not stimulators.
That's simulators.
Yeah, that's it.
What about them?
Well, you wanna know about simulators.
Well, I guess you all heard a lot about simulators... but I'm gonna tell you something about 'em you never heard before.
They gotta be dusted everyday and wet-mopped once a week underneath.
Uh, if this is secret stuff, you don't have to...
No, no, that's okay, Pa.
It's okay. Rush?
Roy, you read a lot about them centrifuges.
What are they like exactly, technically speaking?
Technically speaking...
Well, I guess, technically speaking... you'd say that that's where us guys go to get our "G's."
Oh.
"G's?" Uh, slip of the lip will sink a ship.
Uh, I better not go too far into that, Plank. But I will tell you this.
That thing goes so fast that all the paint starts to peel.
And that paint has to be scraped and sanded down.
The whole thing has to be waxed.
That's your centrifuge.
During your reentry, when do you open your drogue parachute?
Uh, the usual time.
Uh, next question?
- When is that?
- Uh, when it's time. Bert?
Specifically when?
When I darn well please, that's when! Bert?
Uh... what do they get for a haircut at the center, Roy?
Well, I wouldn't know about that, Bert.
Nobody touches this head but you.
Phoney!
I've got a question.
Why don't we all dance?
Ellie.
Oh, that's a fine idea.
Uh, excuse me. Arbuckle, why don't you put something on the phonograph.
You sure got a way with words, Roy.
Well it's all just a matter of knowing your subject.
Hi, Ellie.
Hello, Roy.
Boy, I sure am glad you came. I wouldn't have missed this for anything.
You look good, Ellie. Three weeks sure hasn't hurt you none.
Well, you look like they've been treating you well.
I've been wearing suede shoes and eatin' chow mein every night.
Say, it's gettin' kinda hot in here.
Why don't we step outside and get a breath of fresh air, huh?
I haven't really had a chance to say hello to anybody yet. You'll have time for that later.
Come on.
All right.
Aren't you proud of him, Buck? I sure am.
You know what we ought do? We oughta go down to that space place someday and visit Roy.
Hey, that's a good idea.
We'll do that! The three of us.
Yeah.
Tell me all about what you've been doing.
I'm kinda all talked out on that. I bet it's exciting.
Well, yeah, it's-it's exciting.
You know, Roy, the whole town is really very proud of you.
Well.
You too?
Especially me.
Really?
Mm-hmm.
I'm really very proud of you, Roy.
Uh, Ellie?
Hmm?
You know, I-I never told this to anybody before.
I guess it's because
I never been away before... but while I was away, I missed you more than I've ever missed anybody.
You're very sweet, Roy.
Oh, a tire swing!
Well, can we both fit in there?
Gimme a push, Roy.
Well, all right.
There you go.
"I think that I shall never see a poem so lovely as a tree."
Oh, Roy, you're delightful. Get behind me and give me a great big push.
I'm delightful?
Whee-ee!
Roy?
Roy?
Roy?
I'm sorry, Roy, but I don't like to be taken by surprise. I don't wanna talk about it!
Oh, wait a minute, Roy. I think my father was calling me.
Now, wait a minute, please.
Come over here and sit down.
Now, take the handkerchief away and let me see it. Uh-uh.
Come on.
No.
Now, let Ellie kiss the hurt.
There ya are, boy.
I've been waitin' up for ya.
You're a real Fleming, boy.
Kiss the girls and make 'em cry.
Well.
Come on, Roy. We'll have a little schnapps together before we go to bed.
Some party, eh?
Yeah.
Well, this made us wiser than the Kaiser.
Hey, Roy. You had something you were gonna tell me when you first came in. What was it?
Hmm?
Oh, yeah.
- Yeah, I did.
- Shoot.
Well, Pa, it's like this.
Now, the thing is that I don't want you to feel bad or anything... and I know what this whole thing means to you, but the actual, factual matter is... that the...
Well, I'm gonna quit the astronaut program.
You're gonna quit?
Did these old ears of mine hear Buck
Fleming's boy say he's gonna quit?
Now, Pa, I know all about your war record and I'm darn proud of it; have been for years.
But you see... Now, me,
I'm not cut out for it.
But, Roy... you can't quit, boy.
- Why not, Pa?
- Well...
I'm gonna tell you somethin' about myself that you never heard before.
Sit down.
Your old man is a fake.
What do you mean?
It's my war record. Yeah,
I'm darn proud of it.
Well, don't be.
You know what I really did during the Great War?
I was a librarian at Fort Dix.
I didn't even leave the country.
Librarian?
At Fort Dix?
What about your pension?
Your wound?
The Encyclopedia Britannica fell on me.
"B" to "D".
You mean to tell me that all this time... That's right.
Well...
Oh, Pa.
So you see,
I've been countin' on you, Roy.
Oh, Pa!
Please, Roy!
But th... But th...
D-Don't you worry, Pa.
Ah, I'll, uh...
I'll work it all out somehow.
Eh... D-Don't you worry.
Good night, Pa.
I've never been out to the airfield before. You were here three weeks ago!
I mean, outside of that.
Royal, I hear you and Ellie spent a lot of time in the garden last night.
Yeah, that's right,
Ma, we did.
Have you got anything to tell me? No, we're just good friends.
...past Altoona and connections forward.
Well, looks like we're leavin' kinda early today.
Now boarding at gate number one.
Passengers, all aboard please.
Roy!
I got off work early.
Oh, that's wonderful. Gee, I-I didn't think you were gonna be here.
Oh, what's that?
She was my favorite when I was a little girl.
Do me a favor. Take her into space with you.
Oh, uh, why, sure, sure.
Now boarding at gate number one.
Passengers, all aboard, please.
Well, guess it's time to go.
Ma... bye.
Bye, son.
Plank.
Good luck, Roy. Rush. Bye, Roy.
I can't find no words, son.
It's okay, Pa.
Bye, Ellie.
We're just good friends, Ma.
Houston.
Running away from home?
Mama.
Now this here is the monitor control center.
But that's none of your business.
You just get busy and wax the floor. Yes, sir.
You know, you've been back a week and haven't caught up on your work yet. Well, l...
I'll plug it in for you. Oh.
Oh, thank you, sir. Well, I'm not completely rotten, you know.
I'll be back in an hour to see how you're getting along. Yes, sir.
Uh, excuse me, sir.
Are you getting Sweetwater? What water?
Sweetwater.
Sweetwater, Missouri.
No, that's right outside the building.
The place is full of tourists.
Right outside the building?
Oh, the tourists won't bother you. They're just...
I've never been on the indoors of a space airfield before.
Well, you have now. You're tellin' me.
This is the place, all right.
But I sure don't see no Roy.
Maybe he's up in space.
Ah, they'd have sent Buck a postcard or something.
Yeah.
"Representation of lunar surface."
This here is what your moon looks like. Ohh.
Take a picture of me standin' on the moon. That ain't really the moon.
- We don't have to tell anybody.
- Oh, yeah.
Ready? One... two, three.
Oh!
Oh!
Uh-oh! I better get down off the moon.
Howdy, sir. I'm looking for my son, Roy Fleming.
He's one of your own kind. Pa, what in the world are you doin' here?
Roy! Hey, Roy's inside there!
Well, doggone!
Ain't that a sight!
We thought we'd come down and surprise ya. Well, you sure did!
Course, I am kinda busy, you know. A-Okay there, boy.
Roy, I'm so doggone proud of you I can't stand it!
Well... Uh, how come somebody else's name is on there?
Ain't that your suit?
Uh, no... mine's at the cleaner's. Oh.
Neatness counts, you know.
Boy, they sure don't want you to lose that silver satchel, do they, Roy?
This is your air conditioner. Air conditioner?
Yeah, you can control your own air. That's your switch there.
Wow!
You don't want your blood boilin' when you're doin' space stuff.
The things they have to know.
Yeah.
Roy, would you give us the grand tour?
Well... all right.
Now, this, of course, is your, uh, your training area in here.
Now, this here is a... capsule... and this here is a, uh, your rocket.
Now, this, this here is your, your rail.
I don't know if you've noticed, but there's no smoking in this area at all.
This floor used to be covered with cigarette butts.
What do you think of this floor, by the way? Sure is shiny.
This is your floor.
Got a nice shine to it.
This place is just full of gadgets.
This is where the astronauts... get their... Pa?
Huh?
Pa! Turn off the switch!
Turn the air-conditioning switch.
Aa-Aa-Aah.!
Turn the air-conditioning!
Turn the switch! What?
Huh? The air-conditioning switch! Turn it off!
Find it! Find it! Is there a switch there?
Where's the switch, Roy? Are you all right?
It's cold! It's snow! Gotta get you out of this thing.
Here, here!
Is that the switch, now,
Roy? Snow! Ooh, it's cold!
You warm enough yet, son?
Ah, don't worry about me, Pa.
This body is a finely-tuned space instrument.
I hope they don't get mad about that hole in your suit there.
I'll sew it up.
Good.
Now, son, what is this here that we're standing in front of?
Uh, this here is your, uh, low-pressure chamber.
It's an environment simulator.
You want to conduct this tour?
Heck, no... You think you know more about it than I do?
I didn't say that.
Then tick-a-lock. Okay?
But it says right there,
"Environment Simulator".
Well, look! Do you think that... in a highly-classified place like this you can believe everything you read?
Oh! Oh-ho-ho!
I'm sorry!
Yeah.
Now, where was I?
Oh, yeah.
We're now standing in front of the "environment simulator"... and this is a very highly-secret... classified piece of equipment.
Why don't you get inside and let me get a picture? Oh. All right.
Close the hatch,
Roy.
Look out, now.
You all set?
All set.!
One... two... three!
Hey, how come it worked?
I don't know. I touched the same button and all. Pa?
Pa.!
What?
It's me, Pa.
You wanna just try and get that hatch open?
What's the matter?
Can't you get out?
Of course I can get out. Just open the hatch. Which one, Roy?
Any one.! Just open the hatch.!
You stuck in there? Yeah, I'm stuck in here.! Open the hatch.!
What're you doin'out there?
Get me outta here.!
Uh, Roy, there doesn't seem to be any knob on this thing.
Now, is there something in there that you could push out?
Roy!
Roy, you all right?
Stand back!
You tore the guy's suit!
The guy's suit is all...
Okay! All right! Now...
Now, the next thing
I'd like to demonstrate...
Roy, are you gonna get in trouble for wreckin' this thing?
Don't worry about it. Don't worry about it. Just follow me.
Hey, there's Gifford. Yeah.
Major.
Howdy, boys.
Hey, look at that!
Hey!
Boy, I hope it's one of ours. Heh-heh-heh!
Now, this little baby is really somethin' to see.
This here is your high-speed rocket sled. I'll bet she goes like 60.
Sixty?
Plank.
This little sweetheart'll take ya up to 1100 miles per.
That's one-one-double zero, fella!
Get in it, Roy. Let's see how ya look. Oh, well, I, uh...
Go on, Roy, get in.
Go on, Roy, get it.
Well, all right. I'll just get in here and show you how she looks.
Roy, put on your helmet. I wanna get a picture. Uh, oh, all right.
Be careful. She might take off with ya. You don't have to worry, Pa.
See here?
"Rockets will not fire unless, 1: master switch 'A' is turned on."
Let's see, it'd be this right here. track-release ratchets are activated by pulling lever 'B"'.
Lever "B"'d be that.
And "3: ignition button cover is removed." There ya are.
And "4, ignition button is depressed."
See there?
When you got this much power in a thing...
you gotta be careful to arrange everything so just not anybody...
Whoa, boy!
I think I can tell you what went wrong there! That was wonderful, Roy!
You see, the thing is, I didn't mean to... Just great! A real treat!
- Mr. Donelli!
- Fleming!
Who is this guy? I'm ashamed to say, one of my apprentice janitors.
Janitor? That's right. The worst 1074 we've ever had.!
Fleming, pick up your check in the morning. You are fired!
Well... I'll see you at the front gate.
I recall I left my hat at the training center.
Got my hat.
Uh-huh.
Well, I suppose I'll be home by supper, the way Plank drives.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
Be home 'bout supper.
The way Plank drives.
Yeah.
Well, I'll be seeing ya.
Pa?
You shoulda told me, boy.
I'm sorry.
Guess you'll be along tomorrow after you get your pay?
I'll see ya.
Pa?
Ten-hut.
No, son.
We're just a couple of losers.
Four, three, two, one...
ignition, blastoff!
Come on, let's go.
Come on, now, let's go.
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three... two, one, ignition, blastoff!
Here we go.!
Ten, nine, eight, seven... six, five, four, three... two, one, ignition, blastoff!
Go get 'im, boy! Go get 'im, Charlie!
Atta boy!
Hey, come on! Take a turn, slim! Come on in!
Come on! Get on the pad, boy! Get in there!
Here you go. Have a drink! Here we go. Come on.
Ten, nine, eight, seven... six, five, four, three... two, one, ignition, blastoff!
Come on there, slim! Atta boy, slim! Go, go, go, go!
Put it right down there, slim! Go, go, go, go!
Sorry to keep you waiting, gentlemen. Dr. Bowen.
Cervantes.
Your permission, sir.
Let's get at it. Anything further from intelligence? Not since that last report.
Can I have your attention, please, gentlemen?
As you know, the projected launch date for the Eclipse... was to be in the middle ofJuly.
Major Gifford here was going to man the capsule.
However, the Russians have thrown us a curve.
Oh, thank you.
Here it is.
In exactly 48 hours,
1500 Greenwich time... the Russians plan to launch their fully-automated capsule.
That's bad enough, but on top of beating us to the punch...
In order to fully demonstrate the reliability of their automation... their capsule will be solely occupied by an individual who... now get this... is neither an aviator nor an astronaut.
This is ridiculous! They are in fact, gentlemen, sending up a dentist!
They must be kidding! A man with no experience in space technology whatsoever.
I don't get it.
It's very simple.
They're going to show the world that their automated capsule... is so foolproof, they can send anybody up in it.
- Scotty, what's the story on Eclipse?
- We've got a vehicle ready.
We can mount Eclipse on it and be ready for launch in 36 hours.
- Bob, how 'bout weather?
- C.A.V.U. will hold, all down the range.
That would give us a
12-hour jump on the Russians.
Now our most pressing problem is finding the man to take this ride:
The least qualified individual you can possibly think of.
In other words, the last man on earth that you would send into space.
Sir, I have a suggestion.
Ten, nine, eight, seven... six, five, four, three... two, one, ignition, blastoff!
Wonderful, Roy!
You mean you fired him?
That's right. He was always... Where'd he go?
I don't know. I saw him leaving the center about two hours ago.
Come on, Charlie.
One more time! Ten, nine, one, 'nition, 'lastoff!
Atta boy!
Go, go, go, go!
Well, let's try down on "B" Street.
Oh, no. He's not the type to hang out in bars.
The way he's feeling, he's liable to hang out anywhere.
Do you live with your folks?
Oh, come on!
Hey, nice goin', slim! Hey, you're welcome!
Hey, bartender, another beer!
Would you like another little drinkie? No, thank you.
I have had an elegant sufficiency.
You're a high school grad, aren't ya?
Of course!
Do you happen to know with whom you happen to be with?
Whom?
Exactly.
Watch out for that, slim! Right, right.
Hey, bartender, where's that beer?
Do you know what I did today... that just happens to be highly-secret... classified information?
No.
I soloed, by myself... a rocket sled at 11,000 miles an hour.
What do you think about that?
Hey, bartender!
S'that other beer?
- Hold out your hand this time.
- A-Okay, there!
Fire one!
Uumph! Uuh!
Aah, Maj!
Oh, Maj, listen, I'm really sorry about today.
I'm gonna buy you all a new sled.
In fact, you tell Mr. Cervantes I'm pretty sure my car insurance will cover all that.
Roy, forget about the sled.
No kidding, I'm really sorry!
Now, listen, snap out of it. Uh... Yeah...
Come on, now. I've got something very important to tell you. Yeah?
Like what? What could be worse? My own father doesn't love me anymore!
Listen, there's a good chance for you to go up in space. What're you talking about?
That's right. They want to send you up in the Eclipse.
Me? How come me? We'll explain it to you later.
Will you do it, Roy? Come on, Roy, what do you say?
Will you go into orbit?
You put her on the pad, boys.
I'll take her up.
G'nother beer, bartender!
All you have to do, Fleming, is go for the ride. You'll have no duties to perform.
Repeat this number: 41, 36... 41.
Ever had fits of depression?
You're not listening. 36.
You get finished here,
I'll fly you to the launch area.
You'll be able to communicate with us, but don't touch anything.
Ever contemplated suicide?
I won't touch anything.
Ears look all right.
He hasn't answered me.
My ears look all right. Well, how about it, is he all right?
As far as I can see...
I would say that...
Good. I want you to know that you're doing this... of your own free will, understood? 36.
That's good enough for me!
Come on!
Everything all right back there, Roy?
Roy? Roy?
Cape Kennedy.
Cervantes or Fleming arrive yet?
Cervantes arrived five minutes ago, but
Fleming isn't with him. He's not with Cervantes?
- We'd better scratch.
- T-minus 14 minutes and counting.
I thought for sure he'd be with Cervantes.
Holy Toledo!
Oh, no.
No, not me.
They're not gettin' me up in that.
Quit? Did these ears hear Buck
Fleming's boy say he's gonna quit?
You see... Me, now,
I'm not cut out for it.
The whole town's talkin'.
They say, "There goes Buck
Fleming, father of the astronaut. "
A toast, Rush.
Roy Fleming: a credit to his town, father, nation...
and now, the entire universe.
Over the top, boy.
Ten-hut.! About face.!
Hut, two, three, four.!
Hut, two, three, four.!
Hut, two, three, four.!
T-minus eight and counting.
Still green, still green.
Is he ready? He's on his way to the gantry.
Now, look. You just take the ride. Let us handle it.
Good luck, Fleming.
Uh, about how high up are we now?
'Bout 15 stories.
You guys wanna hear something funny? I can't stand heights.
And you wanna know why?
Well, when I was little, my cousin Elwood and me... we climbed up in this big apple tree, you know, to steal apples.
Well, it was a real tall tree. Taller than my father's room. You could see all over.
Well, we got up there and the wind began to blow... and that tree began to shake and sway.
I really was scared
I was gonna fall.
So, ever since that time, I've been afraid of heights and that's why I don't wanna go.
I said I don't wanna go!
I don't wanna go, guys!
T- minus one minute.
Clear the launch area.
Guys, I don't wanna go!
T- minus 50 seconds.
Still counting.
Waah! Hey!
Uh! Aah!
T- minus 30 seconds.
Green condition, all go.
Not yet! I'm not in!
Hey, aah! Aa-Aa-Aah!
Fifteen, fourteen, thirteen...
twelve, eleven, ten...
nine, eight, seven, Hold on. Hold on! Oh!
six, five, four...
three, two, one,
zero, ignition.
All systems are go.
Looks good.
How's Fleming, Dr. Lowe?
Heart rate, high; blood pressure, high; temperature, high; respiration, erratic.
Take it easy, Roy, take it easy.
Good liftoff, real good.
Thank you.
- All lights green.
- Tracking radar, go.
- Ground telemetry, go.
- Communications, go.
Booster engine cutting off.
Stand by for staging.
First stage separating.
Uhh!
Hello! Hello down there!
She broke!
She broke!
I felt a big hunk fall off!
Take it easy, Roy. Take it easy.
Your first stage separated.
Nothing to worry about.
Everything's going real good.
You'll be coming into range of the Bermuda Tracking Station now.
Gee, I've always wanted to go to Bermuda.
Uh, heart rate, blood pressure, respiration, approaching normal.
Uh, about how high up am I now?
Altitude: approximately 90 miles.
Rapid increase in pulse rate, blood pressure and respiration.
Coming up on second stage. Roy.
In 15 seconds your second stage is going to fall off. Now, nothing is broken.
It's all right.
Second stage gone.
No sweat, chickie.
Atta boy, Roy. Atta boy.
Say, uh, Fred? Uh, there's something I forgot to ask you.
Eh, it's kind of important right now. How do you...
Oh, yes. Well, the procedure on that...
What you do is...
You're kidding!
We interrupt the showing of Doughboys in Action with a news bulletin.
Doggone interruptions, interruptions!
The war'll be back in just a minute, Arbuckle.
The United States has scored a beat on the Russians... by putting the first untrained layman in space.
Ajanitor named Royal Fleming from Sweetwater, Missouri...
has been launched in the Eclipse 1, the space agency's first fully-automated capsule.
Stay tuned for more details. Mother, did you hear that? They launched our son!
Mother!
Wake up, Mother!
Wake up! They, they...
Doggone, I wonder if the boys are watchin'?
Mother, Mother, they...
Oh, Arbuckle, l...
Yes, ladies and gentlemen,
Eclipse control has confirmed... that after five minutes and 30 seconds into mission...
Roy Fleming, the courageous janitor, is in orbit.
Hey! Hello?
I'm loose!
I'm floating!
Get me down! Hello!
You should be strapped in your seat, Roy. Get back in there.
Hey, you guys!
Help!
How're you doing, Roy?
Hey-ey-ey! Aah!
Roy, are you all right?
Hey! Hey!
Hey, you guys!
Showing a 360-degree-per-second roll.
Hey! What's going...
Wha...
Hey, stop this thing!
It's turning!
Roy, don't touch those controls.
Let go of that handle.
Roy.!
Let go of that handle.!
Okay.
Uhh...
Roy, you all right?
Come in, please.
Come in, Roy, come in.
Come in, Roy, come in.
Mama.
What was that?
Mama.
Roy, are you all right?
He might be suffering from hallucinatory regression as a result of cosmic bombardment... or it's possible he's inhaled some helium and it's affected his vocal chords... or...
Or what?
He's had a baby.
Fleming's orbit is going very well.
Within minutes, Eclipse will be picked up...
by the Grand Canary Island Tracking Station, the next monitoring base in the network.
That doggone kid!
Now it's all clear to me.
He had to lie to me.
It was a government secret.
Buck Fleming's boy in space! A-Okay there!
Hello? Hello? Hey, you guys,
I got in the chair all right.
He seems to have settled down some.
Good, good. Let's try the eating experiments.
Okay. Roy, we'd like to conduct some eating experiments. How would you like some crackers?
Uh, no thanks,
I had an apple on the bus.
Have some crackers anyway. Reach down on the left side of your command seat.
You'll find a plastic packet.
Have you got it?
A-Okay on the crackers.
Fred, is there any peanut butter?
You'll find a plastic tube in the food cabinet below your left elbow.
At last report, astro-janitor Fleming is enjoying a hearty meal...
while orbiting the earth at 17,000 miles an hour.
Chew each bite
28 times, dear.
I'm getting a red on the flight programming computer.
No!
Check that again.
No, still getting a red.
Control to Eclipse. Roy, we're getting a minor malfunction... on your flight programming computer tape.
Will you check it, please? It's above your head to the right.
We're full of it here.
It's a mess.
Roy... can you very carefully put that tape back on those reels?
Well, I'll try.
Is it all right if I don't finish the crackers?
It has been confirmed the Eclipse is in trouble.
The difficulty lies in the programming computer, which is similar to a tape recorder.
This tape carries the impulses which tell the Eclipse what to do and when to do it.
In other words, the mechanical brain of the capsule.
Without it, astro-janitor Roy Fleming may be doomed to stay forever in orbit.
How are you doing, Roy? Got that tape back on the reels? I'm workin' on it.
If anything happens to that boy, I'll never forgive myself.
This emergency is being handled with great courage by Fleming.
This young man, never before in space...
is calmly rewinding the computer tape by hand. Buck Fleming's boy.
No.
Roy Fleming.
How you doing, Roy?
Don't worry about it, Fred.
I got it all back on. It's fine.
Roy, we still have a red on the computer here.
Well, I do have some crackers and peanut butter mixed in with it. Is that important?
Hello?
Roy?
Standing by.
Without that, you won't be coming down again.
You're kidding.
Pulse rate, blood pressure and respiratory: emergency readings!
We should've used a monkey or a dog or something.
Roy.
What? You should be over our tracking station on Canton Island.
Look out the window. Oh, no, I'm not gonna look out the window!
Look out the window.
That's an order!
Well... all right.
I'm looking out.
Uh, hey.
Holy smoke!
How're you doing, Roy?
Now listen to me. In a few seconds, you should be over Kauai in the Hawaiian Islands.
When you see that...
He's gone dead. We're transmitting.
He's not getting through.
Roy? Roy, come in, Roy. That poor devil.
The trouble's in the Eclipse.
There's no malfunction here.
Fred! Fred, talk to me!
I-I read you, Roy.
Can you read me?
Fred! Mr. Cervantes!
Anybody at that end!
Listen, you guys, I just saw Hawaii.
What was I supposed to...
Hawaii.
Hawaii!
We are now passing over the Hawaiian Islands.
Our flight plan will carry us to the recovery area 100 miles southeast of the Bahamas.
Starting our retro-rocket countdown.
Five, four, three, two, one.
He's bringing her down!
See anything, Al?
No.
I don't understand it.
He should be splashing down.
Radar says he's definitely in this area.
Fleming! Captain Ferguson. Welcome aboard.
Thank you! What'd you think of my little joke there?
Well done, Fleming. You deserve a great deal of credit.
Well, it's all a matter of keeping a clear head... and solving your problems one by one as they come up.
That's about all there is to it. Follow me below.
The doctors are waiting to give you a medical debriefing.
Well, I'm sure they'll find me in shipshape, skipper.
And as soon as they're finished, a jet fighter will have you ashore in 15 minutes.
Jet fighter?
Uh, how long does the ship take?
I'm proud of you, Roy!
Be happy, son!
I'm proud!
Good-bye.
Good luck!
Bye-bye, Papa.
Good-bye, darlin'.
Be happy.
Bye. All right, be happy now.
I hope she has a good time.
Miss Lemmon! Miss Lemmon!
Miss Lemmon!
What?
Doctor Warfield!
Miss Lemmon, get Professor
Kelp in here immediately.
But, Dr Warfield, I think Professor
Kelp has a class right now.
He had a class. Can't you hear?
Now, get him!
Fire's up here.
Get the axe! Get the axe!
All right, men, all together at the door.
Look out! Look out! Look out!
Oh, oh... I beg your pardon.
Oh, but this is terrible!
Oh...!
Oh... Oh...
Oh, my...!
Professor Kelp?
Are you all right? And if you are, where are you all right?
Oh, my...
Dr Warfield wants to see you in his office.
- Dr Warfield?
- Yes, right away.
I used too much...
Kelp.
How long have you been on the faculty of this university?
Well, now, I would say, er... prior to my exposure as a student counsellor, USC, three years...
No, I went to post-grad, naturally, two years... No...
I had a botany exposure in one particular school...
I had decided, pre-med, botany, whatever,
I would prefer the sciences...
I think I should go back to when I graduated...
How long?!
Two years and 22 minutes now.
Kelp, as I recall, upon your arrival here,
I told you and the other new faculty members,
I will not stand for any member of staff utilising the university's facilities for his or her own personal experiments.
Did I not make myself perfectly clear?
Good, I knew my memory served me well.
And Kelp, wasn't it approximately six weeks later that you conducted a rather interesting experiment before your class?
Let me see... I think it had something to do with an additive to gasolene for the purpose of increasing the efficiency of the combustion engine.
- Right?
- Yes, it was something to that effect...
Do you recall what that additive was?
Yes, as a matter of fact, now that you bring it up, the additive was
3 parts carbon, 5 parts hydrogen,
1 part nitrogen, 3 parts oxygen.
- Which, of course, is?
- Nitroglycerine.
- The results were?
- Negative.
- And?
- Noisy.
Noisy!
It was the worst explosion in the history of this or any other university.
That was two years ago and they're still talking about it today.
Now you mention it, I saw young Phips the other day.
You recall Arnold Phips was in my class that day?
Yes, really, what did he have to say?
He's feeling much better and the bandages should be off in two weeks.
Oh, well, a couple... Exactly!
That's exactly what I mean!
You are a menace.
Professor Kelp, believe me, I know what I'm talking about.
Kelp, it's human nature.
Kelp, people just don't like teachers blowing up their kids.
Kelp, try to understand that I understand that scientists and creators have their little eccentricities.
Einstein hated haircuts, da Vinci loved to paint and Newton...
Didn't he have something to do with figs?
So therefore I, too, realise that you have many of the same eccentricities.
Leave them in the locker when you come in in the morning, Professor.
And feel free to take them home at night.
All right, Kelp, simmer down and relax.
I'm sure we won't have to have another talk like this again. Am I correct?
Oh, without question, you're absolutely... yes, we'll never have to correct our talk.
We won't ever speak...
That is, we'll never have to talk again.
We just never will discuss talking.
Er, we shouldn't really converse about speaking.
Professor, our discussion has come to an end.
- Thank you, Dr...
- Kelp.
Yes?
Your watch... does it... always?
Oh, no, just when I open...
Those are your greens.
Hi, how are you?
"Therefore, through history,
"man has been curious..."
- Professor Kelp.
- Yes, Worfshefski?
- I have to go...
- You have to go?
Since when did you find it necessary to ask permission to go?
No, well, what I meant to say,
Professor Kelp, was that...
I have to go to football practice.
Football practice?
At this hour?
What about your studies?
Well, Mr Coughman, the coach, he asked me to try and get off my first class this morning...
Get off your first class?
Did he, now? To get off your first class?
Mr Worfshefski, had you learned anything in your first class, and I refer to the elementary class, you might not be in such dire need of learning now.
Your request is denied.
Please sit down.
I don't want to hear another word about your stupid practice.
You don't have no call to go yelling at me like that, Professor Kelp.
Worfshefski, I might have been a little rash.
That wasn't very nice calling my practice stupid.
I meant I was stupid in assuming practice was stupid.
Naughty, naughty, naughty.
- Teacher!
- Well, you shouldn't be upset.
W... W... Worfshefski, you're breaking my...
There goes the tibia. Worfshefski, you're... Worfshefski!
You must realise that...
You don't realise what you're doing, Worfshefski.
Worfshefski, you don't realise what you're doing.
Well, just don't do something, sit there!
Er, that is... class dismissed!
You may go.
Can I be of any assistance,
Professor Kelp?
Oh, er...
Thank you, Miss Purdy, you're very, very considerate.
Actually, I would appreciate the assistance for were it not for you assisting me
I might very well be here all semester.
Well, er, let's start with the book.
Yeah... I don't know, I...
You have to... The, er...
Wait, it's connected, you better not press that.
Just pull it out, Miss Purdy.
Oh, that really snapped.
- I'm sorry.
- That's all right.
- Try leaning.
- Oh, no, no, no, no...
Let me just... Let me have this arm...
Just may I have that arm? All right, you just hold some of the body...
Thank you, thank you.
- Thank you, Miss Purdy.
- Are you all right, Professor?
Oh, yes, this is very embarrassing, Miss Purdy.
Why don't you call me
Stella, Professor?
I thought it was Stella Purdy.
Oh, you mean to call you Stella?
How stupid of me. Sorry.
I will, stupid... Er, Stella.
I'm very upset. It's very embarrassing.
Honestly, Professor, you shouldn't let a big ox like that bother you.
He's the typical bully that loves picking on a small man.
Yes, yes, you're right, Miss Purdy, but you'd best run along or you'll miss your next class.
You're all right?
Oh, yes, as I said, I'm just embarrassed. I'm fine, thank you.
Er, Miss Purdy...
Miss Pur... Excuse me.
The, er...
He's a typical bully that loves picking on a small man... picking on a small man... picking on a small man...
I think I broke myself.
Wrong way, sir. This is the gym.
I take it you're new?
- Well, I'm not brand new.
- No, I mean a new student.
I'm terribly sorry, sir.
Are you hurt?
Well, actually, if you would say that a man with an ulcer, a nail in his shoe and a splinter in his finger was then struck by lightning...
If you could say he wasn't hurt then I'm not hurt.
Good. By the way, we don't wear glasses at Vic Tanny's.
Fine, I'll just take these off.
I didn't realise that you're not supposed to, er...
There's nowhere really that I...
Is there some place I could put?
- Shall I put these in a locker?
- I'd appreciate it. You're very kind.
I would've put them there had I known that there was a restriction.
Some people use them for a façade, I wear them for eyes.
You see, "for eyes", it's a play on "eyes".
I hope I did nothing wrong by wearing them. I didn't realise.
If we could get started. I do have a class and need to get going.
- Come with me.
- Wonderful.
I've never done this before.
I don't know where to begin.
We start right here.
Identical twins.
- No, that's a pulling machine.
- A pulling machine? What does it do?
- You pull it! 15 or 20 pulls to begin with.
- Oh, I see.
- And take it easy.
- Naturally.
I wouldn't strain myself for the world. Thank you very much.
You're welcome. Er, happy muscles.
Yes, I certainly do.
Oh, yes, I've seen that in those magazines.
Oh, that's invigorating.
Oh, that's terrific.
I'm going to have a great deal of fun with this, I can tell.
"the various aspects, of course, is relativity to hydrogen.
"There is hydrogen, duly explosive and more devastating than the atomic.
"There is equally the devastation in nitrogen... nitrogen, equally..."
I couldn't help but notice -
I was standing here - that's amazing, the way you push those things up there.
It must take a great deal of patience.
And a little muscle.
Oh, yes. Well, you certainly are...
Yes, you are...
I'd love to be able to... I would really enjoy trying that some time.
I don't think you'd have the patience for it.
I have the other thing you mentioned: A little muscle.
I say, that was, er, sort of a corker!
Here, enjoy yourself.
I, er... I suspect it was somewhat heavier than I...
- uncanny.
- I agree, Doctor.
But there are a couple of points that I neglected to mention.
Specifically, the day I went to
Vic Tanny, I got on the scale, as they normally do, to check you in, and I weighed 153 pounds, and then after six months,
I weighed myself on that very same scale, and I found that I weighed 151.
Very interesting, Professor Kelp.
But I am surprised that a man with your education and background should be intimidated by a bully to this extent.
Plus, you must know, only some men react to bodybuilding exercise, whereas others just don't.
Professor, revenge can't be that important to you.
I must take objection there, Doctor.
Revenge might have been the motivating force, but I feel that curiosity has taken over where revenge began.
I am more or less being compelled by completing something that I started.
I must finish what I start, finish what I start.
I admire a man who likes to see something through, but your six months have failed.
- What will you do now?
- I actually don't know, Doctor.
That's why I wanted to see you.
I had one plan and I thought
I'd mention it to you.
Chemistry is probably what I know best, that's all I know, really.
Some of the world's finest pharmaceutical companies make bodybuilding minerals, vitamins, chemicals all based on chemistry, so I'd approach it from a chemistry standpoint.
To prove a point, I'll show you...
Oh, Professor, excuse me,
I seem to have run out of time.
I'm due at the hospital.
I'm terribly sorry, I never realised the time. In fact, I have a class...
Go ahead, but I'd like to browse around if it's all right.
Not at all.
- I hope you find what you're looking for.
- You're terribly kind. Thank you.
Let's see, anatomy, body structure, structure of body muscle...
"Man's growth, physically and mentally.
"A man's mind, from childhood to old age, never stops growing.
"Not in size or by measure, but by constant learning and knowledge.
"On the other hand, man's body stops at a point,
"that of completion of the anatomy,
"yet we have learned, through chemistry... " Ha, ha, ha!
"man can grow further with the aid of additional elements."
Seven weeks and 13 experiments have gone by with little or no strides made, but today I'm certain my formula will work, so certain that I plan trying it on myself tonight.
Tonight.
Oh, I'm really...
Oh, Miss Purdy, I'm terribly sorry.
Just let me get you up there, dear.
That's just ridiculous. I never...
I just swung the door...
It's all right. You just knocked the breath out of me.
- So stupid of me.
- I'm perfectly all right. No harm done.
- That's fine.
- Did anyone invite you for tonight?
Invite me? I don't think so... Where?
The class is having a mid-term party at the
Purple Pit. We'd love you to join us.
Thank you, it's terribly considerate and kind of you, and I appreciate it, and I've always said there should be a closer interrelationship between the student and the faculty based on better learning, yet the Purple Pit is off limits to the faculty of the university.
Didn't you know?
Oh, I forgot. I'm sorry, Professor.
I guess it slipped my mind, but the Pit's never been what it's supposed to be, by reputation anyway.
You know, I, too, have heard it's a wild, terrible place, when it's really just a quaint spot where the students can talk and relax and just generally get acquainted.
And when you really get down to it, it's quite dull.
- broads.
- They'll be glad. You gotta do it.
Why not?
Stella, couldn't you talk Kelp into coming?
Can you imagine the professor here?
He'd break into a rash.
Don't be too sure. Professor Kelp's just the kind of guy who might fool you.
I bet he likes to get out on his own a little.
I'll bet you right now he's probably on his way to a secret rendezvous with a mysterious, dark-haired female.
Come in, Julius.
Er, how are you tonight, Jennifer?
- How are you, Julius?
- I'm fine.
I am, too-lius.
Now, be very quiet, Jennifer.
We have a lot of work to do.
- Tonight's the big night.
- Keep very quiet.
He's got a lot of work to do.
Tonight's the big night. The big night.
Well, we're just about ready, Jennifer.
You might be ready, Julius, but if
I were you, I'd think about it.
Think, think, you'd better think.
Better think about it.
I told you, Julius.
I told you, Julius.
I told you, Julius. I told you...
Thank you very much, sir.
We know you'll be very happy.
And you look just stunning.
And we'll have your other suits and things no later than next week.
- What'll it be?
- Ah, that's no way to talk! Tsk-tsk!
"What'll it be?" That's no way to treat a customer.
Come here. Pay attention.
You'll feel better and customers'll be happier.
Try this: "What'll it be, hmm?" Try that.
Come on, we haven't got all night. Try it.
What'll it be... mmm?
Good, that was wonderful. Did anyone ever tell you you couldn't sing?
Nice. Make me an Alaskan Polar Bear
Heater on the double. Come on.
Say, why don't you pick on somebody your own disposition?
Oh, please, Mr Bar-room Brawler, don't hurt me or anything like that.
- Did you say Polar Bear Heater?
- No, you did.
- I said an Alaskan Polar Bear Heater.
- I never heard of that.
Until now. All right, pay attention.
- Two shots of vodka.
- Two shots of vodka.
- A little rum.
- A little rum.
- Some bitters.
- Bitters.
- And a smidgin of vinegar.
- And a smidgin of...
You gonna drink this or rub it on your chest?
That was terrific! Did you hear that, folks? A regular George Bernard Shaw.
Good boy! And he did it all by himself.
You did it all by yourself without help.
That's terrific. And with your own big mouth.
If you don't want the cocktail shaker in your gums, shut up and pay attention.
- Is that clear? Repeat after me: I'll...
- I'll...
- I'll pay attention.
- I'll pay attention.
All right, let's continue.
- A shot of vermouth.
- A shot of vermouth.
- A shot of gin.
- A little gin.
- A little brandy.
- A little brandy.
- Lemon peel.
- Lemon peel.
- Orange peel.
- Orange peel.
Cherry.
- Some more Scotch.
- More Scotch.
Now, mix it nice, then pour it into a tall glass.
I never tried this.
Mind if I take a sip?
Go right ahead.
Not bad.
Hi.
I don't know any better place to get to know a lovely lady than on the dance floor.
- I hope you don't refuse.
- I'm sorry, I'm with...
- Move along, sonny. She's with us.
- Sh! Sit down.
Come here, honey. Stand up a minute.
Just there. I'll be right back.
We don't want trouble, do we? Sit like nice boys.
Would you like me to tell Dr Warfield, my personal friend, of your bad manners?
He would be very displeased. So cool it.
If you're nice lads, cute little chappies, later on I'll let you twirl my key-chain.
Now, relax.
It's all straight, baby.
Put your arm up there.
Remember how they do that in the movies? They walk like high class.
Dancing, nice. We're hugging.
It's wonderful.
Clear the floor.
I know what you're thinking.
Where's he been all my life, right?
No, not exactly.
And that you're happy the way I handled those three goons, right?
Well, normally, I would have belted them.
But I didn't want to muss myself up, and have you dance with a sloppy guy. Dig?
Then, you restrained yourself, just for little old me.
I knew you'd appreciate it.
I do a lot of nice things.
Is that really the case or is this line 27 a for young college girls?
Aw, now, you see?
You went and done it.
One of the rare times in my life when I dig down into the soul, and you doubt my veracity?
Well, that hurts.
Well, it's not your veracity that I doubt.
- The music's stopped.
- Yeah, I heard.
Hold it a second. Hold... Hold it.
We'll make our own music, gorgeous. Just hold it.
You and you stay. Tubby, go rest your thumbs. I'll drive.
- Sweetie, go get your lips pressed.
- Split. - Listen...
You listen. Sit down. You'll be thrilled. Believe you me.
Sit and listen and watch.
Mood is wrong!
Innkeeper, got sexy lights?
Lay it on me.
Better. Better. Now, watch, baby.
Every move a picture.

Back. Back! Thank you, kiddies. You're all very nice little boys and girls.
If you're real nice, tomorrow night I might ration out a little more of this rare talent.
Now, back to your seats, back. Go on, go on.
Back, back, back.
They're nice kids, all nice.
All nice kids.
They have very good taste, I might add.
I'm glad. It would be a shame to waste the genius of yours on the riff-raff.
Honey, I always say, if you're good and you know it, why waste time beating around the bush, true?
And I always say that to love yourself is the beginning of a lifelong romance, and after watching you, I know you and you will be very happy together.
Just a minute, sweetheart.
I don't recall dismissing you.
You rude, discourteous egomaniac.
You're crazy about me, right?
This morning, looking in the mirror,
I enjoyed what I saw so much,
I couldn't tear myself away.
Have some, baby?
If I were your baby,
I'd be swinging from a tree.
- Aw, Stella, that's not nice.
- How do you know my name?
Well, we were introduced.
No, we weren't introduced, or I would have remembered your name.
Tell me how you knew.
You've heard of ESP, extrasensory perception. I'm a firm believer in ESP...
Hey, buddy, you really sang up a storm.
Yeah, I know. Thanks a lot.
Well, you heard him.
Everybody knows Buddy.
- Buddy?
- Yeah.
Well, is that it? Or do you find it difficult remembering two of them?
Hey, you're kooky. That was cute.
"Do you find it difficult remembering two of them?"
Wonderful! I knew you'd be a barrel of laughs.
No, I don't find it difficult remembering two.
- ♪ Love, love, love... ♪
- Buddy...
Love. That's it. Buddy Love.
Buddy Love?
Of the Los Angeles Loves.
But that's of no consequence.
- Shall we make a move?
- Where?
- Do you have a car?
- Of course.
- Crazy. Let's split.
- Let's split what?
- Is it new?
- Not brand new.
- I've driven it a whole week.
- Nutty! Let's go.
Here, baby. Wipe the lipstick off, slide over here and let's get started.
We have started and finished. And for an encore, get an earful of the following.
I'll admit you're a very sharp-looking guy.
And you certainly have that proverbial gift of the gab.
I've only gone this far because when you meet someone like you, your curiosity gets stirred up.
Well, mister, this is one kitten that won't be smitten by that little old devil.
So turn this car around and take me right back where you picked me up.
That is, where we met.
I said wipe the lipstick off.
Was it something I said?
You must be deranged.
If you don't believe in idle chatter and a lot of small talk, yeah, I'm deranged.
You'd prefer I conduct myself like the little boys you usually date?
Nothing delights us more than being enjoyed, appreciated or just plain liked by someone, right?
You're not going to tell me that you're here with me now because I don't appeal to you.
And I'm sure that you can see I dig you pretty good, too, right?
Well, isn't it easier to say so?
Would you prefer I used that phoney dialogue
I'm sure you've heard at least a half a dozen times before?
So you see, Stell, when I tell you that you're a vibrant, beautiful, exciting woman, you can believe me, you can bet it's the truth.
Because I'd have to be a complete idiot not to want to hold you and kiss you, and make our time together a warm, wonderful moment that could grow and develop into many moments, many hours, and into something really important.
Nobody ever said anything like that to me before.
Nor can I ever remember a more honest approach to two people being together.
That's what I want you to understand.
Actually, I've never had, er... er, that is, er... er, what I mean is, er...
Miss Purdy...
Hello, Miss Purdy!
Oh, I'm terribly sorry, Professor.
That's perfectly all right, Miss
Purdy, I hope I didn't wake you.
I don't recall excluding you from the other class members from taking this test.
I'm terribly sorry, Professor,
I was just getting ready to start.
Oh, just getting ready to start.
Splendid, splendid. Just getting ready.
Students, please be aware that the test papers must go on my desk for marking, also please be equally aware of tomorrow's problem:
H20 plus NO2 as we did the other day, if you recall.
I'm awfully sorry, and if it would be agreeable,
I'd like to stay after my last class and take the test.
Well, that's highly irregular, Miss
Purdy, but, er... we... we're...
Are you all right, Miss Purdy?
I'll know better tonight. I mean, yes, sir, I'm quite all right.
Oh, fine, then I'll see you tonight...
That is, after your last class, as you said, to take the test.
- Yes.
- Fine. I'll hold your paper.
- Thank you.
- You're quite welcome.
Be certain that it's after your last class.
I'll be marking these papers accordingly.
Professor.
Ye... Ye... Oh, yes, Gibson?
- I've got that book you asked for.
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.
- Yeah, wonderful.
Oh...
Now, then...
As you might very well recall, yesterday in "Discussing Biology":
"The long legs of the beetle and the wonderful body of the ant."
No, what I meant to say was:
"The beautiful hair of the blonde fish."
No, actually...
Er, no... "The legs..."
"terrific looking..."
I am completely aware of what chemistry and drugs can do to assist and aid the body and mind.
Yet I don't really believe what happened to me comes strictly from chemistry.
There must be an explanation for this phenomenon.
- Jennifer...
- Hi, sweetie.
I knew I was on the right track, but I never figured on anything like this.
I must have hit on heredity. Yep.
That's it. Heredity. Let's see...
Elmer...
Elmer!
If you're not in here in 10 seconds, your dinner will go to your family: The hogs!
Elm...!
Don't you sneak up on me.
I was just finishing the ironing of your underthings, Edwina, darling.
Love... Angel...
And all the other nice things I wish I could think of, so you won't hit... or yell...
- Honey...
- Honey?!
Don't you "honey" me, you... you artificial son of a lizard.
Now, sit down, and for the third time today, make a slob of yourself trying to find your mouth.
Idiot!
- Can't you eat with your mouth closed?
- Not until I get something in it, dearest.
What was that?
Nothing, nothing.
It's quite all right.
You're right. You're always right.
My poor Dada.
My poor Dada.
Well, Jennifer, if that's what's to be then I'll be it.
You know what they say,
Julie-baby: Que sera, sera.
Oh, Jennifer, you know what I'm thinking?
If this formula were to fall into the wrong hands, the consequences could be devastating.
Now, it's much too complicated to memorise and far too vitally important to destroy.
The only two people that I know
I can trust are my mother... and my father.
What I should do... is mail my formula, a copy, to Mother and Father with instructions that were anything to happen to me, they are to send a copy of the formula and my original copy to Washington.
George or Martha?
No, Washington D...
You're a silly bird with a big mouth.
- Professor Kelp...
- Yes?
- I'm ready, Professor.
- That's very... Yeah... What?
Did you forget about my test?
No... er...
Actually, no... I... I'm terribly sorry... I did... I have it here...
Why don't you sit down at your table and I'll get your paper.
I actually didn't, er, really forget. I, er...
I have so many members of the... class, it's difficult to...
Oh, yes, here we are.
It's very difficult to...
You do want me to take the test?
I'm terribly sorry, Miss Purdy.
Certainly, of course, it's necessary for you to take it.
- Miss Purdy...
- Yes, Professor?
I was going to say, I sincerely hope that you don't mind if I don't linger.
I have some very essential matters that I must take care of.
Certainly, Professor Kelp. And thank you for understanding.
I understand far better than you would ever believe, honey...
Er, Miss Purdy, that is.
You just go right on and thank you for...
Julius! In the afternoon?
Hiya, chicky-baby.
- How's it going?
- Fine.
Crazy. I thought I'd visit your little land of learning. Cute. Cute pad.
What happened to you last night?
What d'you run away like that for?
I thought you saw a ghost or something.
Oh, yeah. How about that?
That's why I stopped by.
I thought I'd lay it on you, but this ain't the place to talk.
What do you say we meet later at the
Purple Pit? We could talk better there.
I don't know. You're pretty weird.
And I don't want...
- Sh, sh. 10 o'clock?
- Perfect.
Figures.
Hey, honey, you look a little drawn.
Did you find it a little difficult going all this time without seeing me? Sh, sh.
Don't fight it.
I don't want to hang you up, honey.
I see you're doing your little test here.
But don't worry, beautiful.
Science'll do fine without you.
But man needs you the most.
This man. Come here.
That's good for you. If you want more, call for refills.
Later.
Write nice.
I just told you the time.
It's still 11.15.
- Yeah, I know.
- OK, kids.
You can all relax.
Watch where you're going, Mac.
Now that your desperate attempt at having a good time's flunked, have no fear, Buddy's here.
Let the good times roll.
Hiya, baby.
There's my date.
That sharp-looking chick's my date.
Cheer up, baby, your prize package has arrived.
- Hello, stale ones.
- You're pretty late, Mr Love.
Hold it, baby, you got it a little mixed up.
You're just way too early, that's all.
Be a nice girl and plant one over there. You'll feel better.
Come on, the best things in life are free.
And you'll admit, you've got one of the best things. Lay it on me.
You're impossible.
Yeah, well, have some impossible. Come on.
See, wasn't that worth waiting for?
Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-UH!
You gotta admit, I'm not one of the run-of-the-mill-type creeps that hang around this joint, right?
You got a good thing, don't louse it up.
Isn't it enough that you've got the swingingest and the best?
You want me to be on time, too?
- OK, OK, you win.
- Naturally.
Please tell me why you ran away last night and left me just sitting there?
Hey, hey, don't get all riled up.
Cool it! Cool it!
I don't want to get into no discussions on an empty stomach anyhow. This is flat.
Vampira, bring your kit.
You rang?
You don't sound exactly too thrilled to serve the leader.
On the contrary, I find it a rare privilege to serve His Royal Lowest.
You're cute, like a black widow spider.
Shut your mouth and just take the order.
I've decided I shall not continue the flight with the fuel I got.
So give me a boilermaker, and heavy on the boil.
Go on, go on, go on. Come on,
I haven't got all night.
She's crazy about me also.
Now, Lost Weekend Junior, you've ordered your drink.
About last night. Would you like to explain what happened?
I told you I was going to tell you. It's...
Why don't we table it a while, sweetie?
I mean, all the kids, they're kind of waiting. It's Dullsville out.
I'll be back. You take five. And I love you, baby. Mean it sincerely.
You wait for me, huh?
Oh, there you are, sweets.
Thanks a lot.
Sickening, isn't he?
But... he's got something.
And I mean to find out what it is.
I think I'll do... do a tune that I'm going to record for Poverty Records.
They're the only ones who'll have me.
♪ I'm in the mood for love
♪ Simply... Simp...
♪ Simply because...

♪ Fun... Fun... Fun...

That's...
I think that'll be it for a while, kids.
Later, Stella. Wait...
I feel like the girl on her wedding night whose absent-minded husband goes home to his mother for dinner.
Where is he?
- What time is it?
- I think he's getting his watch fixed.
- Think he had an accident?
- Where is he?
- Ten to one he doesn't show.
- Hope nothing's wrong.

What about the faculty members?
Anyone here familiar with Mr Love?
- Oh, he's the greatest.
- Do you know Mr Love?
Oh... Me?
No... I meant... Well, I heard all the other students...
- Professor Kelp, I heard that myself.
- Yes, you did.
Anyone here know Mr Love?
Very well, in that case, I will have to meet him myself.
Have him come to my office at three o'clock.
Dr Warfield, we don't exactly know how to get in touch with Mr Love, on such short notice, that is.
What do you mean? Is he some kind of roving bum or something?
- I've never heard of such a thing.
- I might see him tonight.
That's not good enough. I want to see him today at three.
I beg your pardon,
Dr Warfield, but I...
I just might be able to see my way clear, possibly, to contact this Mr... Love.
Professor Kelp, I don't care who contacts him.
Just get him here by three o'clock today or forget the whole thing.
Meeting dismissed.
- Where's your pad?
- About a mile from campus.
I have bought the craziest new drapes...
You mean my dictation pad.
- Sorry, I'll get it immediately.
- Never mind. What did you want?
Mr Love is waiting outside to see you and he's a gasser...
I mean, shall I ask him to come in?
- If you can do so without fainting.
- Yes, sir.
You gonna make that your life's work, baby?
Hey, here.
Mr Love?
Buddy to you. What's your moniker?
What do they call you?
Mortimer, Harvey, Norman,
Homer? Which is it?
You may call me Dr
Warfield, young man.
OK, Doc it is.
What kinda doctor are you, sweetie?
Sawbones, is that the idea?
Or a headshrinker? I went to them once, you dig?
Headshrinker. Told me I had a dual personality, split, schizo and all that jazz.
He charges me $82, so I give him $41 and say get the rest from the other guy.
What's eating you?
Mr Love, I sent for you in regard to the senior prom.
However, after seeing you, my door...
Would you think I was terribly rude if
I asked you the name of your tailor?
- That's wild. Absolutely gorgeous.
- Oh, you mean this?
- Just beautiful.
- Actually, it's just a ready-made suit.
You're kidding?
Well, sort of a handmade-to-order ready-made suit off the rack.
Just magnificent. I think you're modest.
Is that the picture, sweetie?
You've got the perfect physique and anything you put on swings, right?
Ever consider going into show business?
- I did a few school plays...
- Nutty...
Girls backstage mob you, swamp you?
Is that the picture?
- Stay there, don't move.
- You might say that in my time...
Sorry, Doc. You all right?
Did you really do a job in show business?
Anyone ever say you got a Cary Grant-ish look?
Ever see him walk towards a girl?
Try that walk. Let me see, I'm just curious. Walk like Cary Grant. Beautiful.
Beautiful. Sure you're doing the right thing working here?
What did you do? Shakespeare?
- I knew it... Hamlet...
- Hamlet...
- Would you do it?
- Mr Love, it's been so long...
Would you do it for me, Doctor?
Come on, baby. It's gotta be wild.
- Go ahead.
- Let's see...
- To be...
- Hold it! Do it right.
Get on the stage. Let me be your audience.
- The faculty...!
- It's the best thing in the world for you.
- Get up there and perform.
- If you insist...
- Let it out.
- To be, or...
Hold it. Let's make it a stage.
Let's make it right.
You're gonna be beautiful, just beautiful. Lay it on me.
Am I in the light?
- To be, or not...
- Hold it! Do it right.
Be in show business. Hamlet, right?
You gotta play it all the way.
Hamlet... Here, put it on. It's gonna make you feel beautiful.
- I feel it already.
- You'll play it like it's never been played.
- Go on. Let it out. Enjoy it.
- It's a difference...
- To be, or...
- Hold it. Do it right. Hamlet?
A prince? You gotta go all the way with the sword.
You dig Hamlet. Do it.
Enjoy it. It's beautiful.
Beautiful. You've wasted your life with this school jazz.
Well, I've often thought of chucking it all...
- To be, or...
- Hold it.
Royalty is one thing, a crown.
Do it right. Hamlet. Do it right.
- Have the crown. Be Hamlet.
- My hat...!
It's the way it should be.
You've got the crown.
- I think I have it.
- Do Hamlet and really let it out.
You're beautiful.
To be, or not to be; that is the question:
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune...
- Oh, beautiful. Doctor, you choked me.
- I'm not through...
You choked me. It was gorgeous.
The prettiest thing I've ever seen.
- See you at the prom, Doc?
- Oh, yes.
- Behind the footlights?
- We'll have you there...
- I knew it, baby. You're beautiful.
- Carry on the great tradition of theatre.
- Practise that Shakespeare.
- At the prom, Mr Love.
To be, or not to be; that is the question...
Jennifer, what am I to do, Jennifer?
Have you ever thought of taking poison?
Ha, ha, ha, ha, Julius, taking poison!
Hi... Doctor.
- Kelp.
- Yes, sir?
- Do you mind?
- Not at all. Do you lead?
I'm sorry. I did misunderstand.
I get carried away, what with the music.
It was a toe-tapper, I must admit.
It's rare to hear instrumentation these days, what with folk singers, etc...
Would you care for some refreshment, Miss Lemmon?
Thank you, I think I would, but let me go. You don't have to bother.
There's no bother.
It would be my pleasure.
- Kelp...
- Yes, I'll have a lemonade, too.
- Kelp, will you get us two lemonades?
- I'm terribly sorry, Doctor.
I was again so terribly distressed at that wonderful toe-tapper.
Well, zip and I'm gone.
Hi, Professor.
- Oh, Stell.
- Stell?
That is, Miss Purdy... I'm sorry.
How are you? Are you having a good time, dear?
I'm having a good time, but...
I'd have a much better time if somebody would ask me to dance.
Cat got your tongue, Professor?
No, the punch bowl has my arm.
- I didn't realise...
- Let me help you.
Thank you. I guess I'm just accident prone.
- Don't worry about it.
- I won't.
- Come on, let's dance.
- Oh, yes, all right. Let me leave that.
That sounds like a splendid idea.
I neglected to mention, Miss Purdy, you're looking very beautiful this evening.
You must be looking forward to seeing your Buddy Love tonight.
- How did you know that?
- Everyone knows he's appearing tonight.
Oh... Here. I guess I'm looking forward to seeing him.
But I can't figure out why.
Well, he is quite good-looking, is he not?
Oh, yes, he is, but that means nothing to me.
He... I'm told he is a young man with a very nice personality.
On the contrary, he's rude, disrespectful, self-centred and discourteous.
Then it's not his nice personality.
Hardly.
I'm told that he's quite talented, though.
Oh, yes, he's very talented.
But talent comes in many forms.
I believe intelligence is a greater talent than anything.
If Buddy has any real intelligence, he has a fantastic talent for keeping it hidden.
I see, well, then, evidently, Miss Purdy, whatever you see in this young man it must be very well buried.
I think you're getting warm.
Well, then, perhaps, and it's just a possibility, he chooses to keep the inner man locked up so that no one steps on him.
But he should know I don't want to step on him.
Maybe someday I'll get to prove it to him.
If he ever unlocks that inner man and lets him loose, so that I can grab him and hold him.
- I appreciate it.
- What?
That... What I meant was, that's very nice.
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
It's show time. Gather round!
We'll get the show on the road.
Before we go on, I'd like you to meet some of the specialists:
There's Butch Stone up there, you remember Butch.
My kid brother, Stumpy Brown.
Stumpy not only plays the trombone, but also sings.
Butch Stone is known for 'A
Good Man is Hard to Find'.
We've a great show lined up for you, a few surprises...
Why do men keep running away from me?
The formula...
- Jennifer!
- Hi, there.
Jennifer.
My formula.
Th-Th-The formula.
Jennifer, you've eaten all of my formula.
- Excuse me.
- Oh, shut up, you stupid bird!
Then I can't suggest you call your mother and father and get them to read the formula from the copy you sent...
Oh, what a wonderful bird!
Where's the phone?
Long distance will be area code...
Oh, yes, area code...
Sp... Sp... Splendid idea, Jennifer.
H... Hello, Father.
Hello... I say, hello, Father.
This is Julius. Yeah, I...
Julius... J... Yes, your son.
Would you be good enough, Dad, to open the formula for me and read it to me so I can mark it down.
Yes, I certainly... Actually,
I'd appreciate it, yes...
It's just going to have to be enough.
Where can he be? I hope nothing's happened to prevent his getting here.
He better get here or there'll be a riot.
Thank you. Thank you very much.
Ladies and gentlemen, introducing the next performer is one of the easiest chores I've ever had.
Simply because this card I'm holding is the announcement that the performer wants read exactly as written.
Makes it easy.
Ladies and gentlemen, presenting the world's greatest everything.

I, er...
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'm not usually at...
I'm not usually at a loss for words, but if you'll just... bear with me a moment, I think
I might be able to explain.
It happened some time ago... being a scientist, I just happened to have stumbled on one of the curious mysteries of science.
I found myself... so curious that I was unable to just stop.
Nonetheless...
I never really knew what was going to prevail.
I do know now that I should've left it alone... actually.
But... it is a very, very hard thing to do, particularly when you've found that you've been able to do something that so many others failed to do.
Therefore...
Actually, I have no real defence for my actions, other than...
I had no control over what I said or did as Buddy Love.
I can only say...
I hope...
I hope I haven't hurt anyone... hurt anyone.
I didn't mean to hurt anyone.
I didn't mean to do... anything that wasn't of a kind nature.
Learning a lesson in life is... is never... is never really too late.
And I think that the... the lesson that I learned came just in time.
I don't want to...
I don't want to be something that I'm not.
I didn't like being someone else.
At the same time,
I'm very glad I was.
'Cause I found out something that I never knew.
You might as well like yourself.
Just think about all the time you're going to have to spend with you.
And...
Well...
If you don't think much of yourself, how can others?
That's what I found out.
Dr Warfield, I'm very sorry and...
I like it here at the university very much.
I hope that...
I hope that after you hear the facts, you won't think too terribly wrong of me.
I love everybody here and I...
I wouldn't really like to leave... actually.
Can I be of any assistance, Professor?
No, thank you very much. I'll...
I'll have to just try and work this out myself, thank you.
Well, there's really nothing to work out, Professor, other than understand that just being one person is more than enough for any human being to handle.
Do you mean that...
- Well, you have to understand that...
- Sh!
I'm only trying to say that I'd never want to spend my life with anyone like Buddy.
Being the wife of a professor would be much more normal and... much happier.
Oh, Stella!
See, I... I told you
I'm accident prone.
That's actually...
"The psychological properties of visual quality and quantity
"can be represented conveniently by a three-dimensional diagram.
Three-dimensional diagram, right. Oddly enough...
Thanks, sonny. Thanks for telling us where our kid works.
Not so loud, Elmer, dear.
Loud? Who the devil's loud?
Oh-oh! Whoah-oh!
Marge, Marge, Marge, Marge.
Hey, class, how are you?
Good to be amongst.
Well, well...
If it isn't the square bookworm we laughingly referred to as our son.
Here, bookworm, have a cigar.
Go ahead, go on. Pure Havana, straight from Havana, yeah.
Cost us $6 million ransom.
Pretty good, huh?
Good to see you again, Julius.
Mush and hush. Mouth, mouth, hush, mush.
Here, now, back, back.
Hush. Nothing.
Here it is, kids. Are you tired of being a square? Tired of a dull existence?
Well, for one dollar, the tenth part of a sawbuck, try Kelp's Kool Tonic.
You, too, can be the life of the party.
He's right, kids, it's a gasser.
Step right up, folks.
Be somebody, be anybody.
- Sixteen bottles, look, here.
- Five...
Wait, wait, wait, Stella.
Wait, sweetheart, what have I done?
What has he done? What will I do?
I know what you'll do.
Do you have the licence?
- Yes, here it is, dear.
- What are we waiting for?
What about the formula, what about Mother, what about Father?
What's done is done. And we have our own lives to live.
Come on, let's go.
Yes, actually, Stella, what's right is right, let's split.
Subtitles by Julie Donaldson
On Sunday August 13th 1961, the eyes of
America were on the nation's capital, where Roger Maris was hitting home runs number 44 and 45 against the Senators.
On that same day, without any warning, the East German communists sealed off the border between East and West Berlin.
I only mention this to show the kind of people we're dealing with - real shifty.
Having been stationed in Berlin,
I know what I'm talking about.
Let's go back to last June.
Considering it was a divided city, life in Berlin was more or less normal.
It wasn't too much trouble to pass from one side of the Iron Curtain to the other.
Some East German police were rude and suspicious, others suspicious and rude.
The Eastern Sector, under communist domination, was still in rubble, but the people went about their daily business - parading.
These constant provocations failed to provoke the West Berliners.
They were too busy rebuilding.
The Western Sector, under allied protection, was peaceful, prosperous and enjoyed all the blessings of democracy.
Just by coincidence, this happens to be the company I work for.
Danke schön.
Danke schön, Fritz.
Danke schön.
Danke schön already!
Sitzen machen.
Schlemmer!
Good morning, Mr MacNamara.
How many times have I told you I don't want those people standing at attention?
- I know. I have given strict orders.
- Can't they get it through their heads?
- They're in a democracy now.
- That is the trouble.
Before, if I told them to sit they would sit.
Now they do what they want. They stand.
- Any word yet from the mayor's office?
- Yes, sir.
- No Coke machine in the Reichstag.
- Sometimes I wonder who won the war.
Did you pick up those airline tickets for my wife and children?
Three seats to Venice via Frankfurt.
Call the Frankfurt plant for another 100,000 bottles.
People keep smuggling Cokes into the Eastern Sector.
Next. I'm expecting the Russian
Trade Commission at 10.30.
- Yes, sir.
- Next. You're fired.
- Sir?
- Unless you stop clicking your heels.
Yes, sir. I'm sorry.
I keep forgetting myself.
- That old Gestapo training, huh?
- You must not say that. It is not true.
- What did you do during the war?
- I was in the underground.
- Resistance fighter?
- No, motorman. In the subway.
- Of course you never liked Adolf.
- Adolf who?
Down where I was I didn't know what was going on up there.
That will be all, Schlemmer.
Rausmachen.
- Guten Morgen.
- Guten Morgen to you, Fraulein Ingeborg.
It is not Fraulein, it is Fräulein.
With an umlaut.
(whistles) I'll say. Monthly report.
To WP Hazeltine, home office, Atlanta, from CR MacNamara, Berlin branch.
Production figures for May,
270,000 cases.
Consumption per capita now 5.2 per cent above last year.
Outselling Rhine wine eight to one, rapidly creeping up on draft beer.
Next. Campaign to reorient German businessmen's lunch succeeding.
27 per cent now having Coke with their knackwurst.
Now, here's a real hot flash.
We may become the first American company to crack the Iron Curtain.
I have started negotiations with the Russian representative.
It looks most promising. More later.
Next. What did you do over the weekend?
- Nothing. I stayed home waiting for you.
- I couldn't get away.
But there's good news tonight.
Yes?
Mrs MacNamara? Put her on.
- Yes, Phyllis. What's the matter?
- It's Tommy. We're having a crisis.
Why don't you talk to him?
Tommy, your father's on the phone.
Hello, Dad.
- Nothing. Mother's ganging up on me.
- What do you mean by that?
Your mother's right. What are you going to do with roller skates in Venice?
- All the streets are underwater.
- So what? I'm taking my snorkel.
Here. Your husband wants to talk to you.
Grrr...
- Yes, Mac.
- Look, let him pack what he wants.
All right, so I'm spoiling him. Big deal.
Don't worry. Pick me up at the office and I'll take you to the airport.
Yes, mein Führer.
- Bertha asks what you'd like for dinner.
- I've got a deskful of work.
I'll just grab a quick bite somewhere.
So long, dear.
- Like I said, good news.
- Your wife, she's making a trip?
- Going on vacation. Mit die Kinder.
- Ach so.
So tonight we'll start the German lessons again.
- You must be getting rusty.
- We'll just have to work twice as hard.
- Das ist gut?
- Sehr gut.
And the first thing we'll do is brush up on the umlaut.
Das ist wunderbar.
Like all the lilacs in Lower Bavaria.
- The communist gentlemen are here.
- Send them in.
Fraulein Ingeborg, put that on the teletype to Atlanta.
- And take your gum.
- Jawohl.
Nice to see you again,
Comrade Mishkin. Hey.
Ah, Mr MacNamara.
Commissar Peripetchikoff, chairman of our trade commission.
And Comrade Borodenko from the soft-drinks secretariat.
Sit down.
- Sit down, boys.
- We have no objection.
- Cigarettes? Cigars?
- Take one of these.
Thanks.
- Made in Havana.
- We have trade agreement with Cuba.
- Cigars for rockets.
- Good thinking.
Comrade Mishkin tells me you are keen on getting Coca-Cola into Russia.
He is totally wrong. I did not say keen.
I said we are mildly interested.
Nevertheless.
Comrade Mishkin suggested we start with six bottling plants. Moscow, Leningrad...
You guys got cheated.
This is a pretty crummy cigar.
Do not worry.
We send them pretty crummy rockets.
As I was saying. Six plants.
Moscow, Leningrad, Stalingrad,
Kiev, Kharkov and Minsk. Right?
Wrong. I never mentioned Minsk.
I said Pinsk.
All right. Pinsk is in, Minsk is out. Our contract will contain the usual provisions.
- We supply the syrup, you do the bottling.
- Certainly not. You supply the formula.
Forget it. We give it to you, first thing we know the Chinese communists'll have it.
- No formula, no deal.
- OK, no deal.
We do not need you. If we want
Coca-Cola, we invent it ourselves.
Oh, yeah? In 1956 you flew a bottle of
Coke to a secret laboratory in Sverdlovsk.
Your chemists went nuts trying to analyse the ingredients. Right?
No comment.
In 1958 you planted two agents in our home office to steal the formula.
What happened? They both defected.
Now they're in Florida packaging instant borscht. Right?
- No comment.
- Last year you put out an imitation.
Kremlin-Cola.
But even the Albanians wouldn't drink it.
- They used it for sheep-dip. Right?
- No comment.
So either get down to business or get off the pot.
If we are to live together in peaceful coexistence, there must be give and take.
- Oh, sure. We give and you take.
- What is the matter. You do not trust us?
No comment.
If you do not mind, we have a conference.
Help yourself.
What is this?
My employees gave it to me. On the tenth anniversary of the Berlin Airlift.
Are we going to stand here and listen to cheap propaganda?
Relax, Boris. While they are putting Uncle Sam in cuckoo clocks we will put Soviet cosmonaut on moon.
You may be the first to shoot a man to the moon, but if he wants a Coke on the way he will have to come to us.
All right. We agree in principle.
You supply the syrup.
Next. The deal will be set up on a royalty basis.
In Russia we do not have royalty.
Not since we liquidate the tsar.
You'll pay us a percentage of the gross.
- Money?
- Dollars?
You would accept three-week tour of Bolshoi Ballet?
- Please. No culture, just cash.
- The ugly American.
- We reserve the right to plant inspection.
- And we reserve the right to veto.
- Our inspectors...
- We veto it.
I thought so.
Forget details.
Draw up temporary agreement.
- We will submit to Moscow.
- I'll consult with Atlanta.
- When will papers be ready?
- I'll put my secretary to work on it.
- She's that blonde lady?
- That's the one.
Send papers to East Berlin with blonde lady in triplicate.
- The papers in triplicate or the blonde?
- See what you can do.
We are staying at the Grand Hotel Potemkin.
- How about a vodka and Coke?
- No, thank you.
We have meeting with Swiss trade delegation.
They sent us 20 carloads of cheese.
Totally unacceptable. Full of holes. Bye.
See you round the campus.
Ring-a-ding-ding!
- What is it?
- It is the overseas operator.
You are to stand by for a call from Atlanta.
They must have gotten my teletype about the Russian deal.
- It went good?
- Good? Look at this.
All virgin territory.
300 million thirsty comrades.
Volga boatmen and Cossacks,
Ukrainians and Outer Mongolians.
Do you realise what it means?
- The stock, it will go up?
- I'll go up.
Head of all European operations, headquarters in London.
- May I be the first to congratulate you?
- Should have had that job five years ago.
But I got loused up by Benny Goodman.
- Benny Goodman?
- I was in charge of the whole Middle East.
Nine countries,
15 bottling plants all facing Mecca.
Goodman and his band were coming through on a goodwill tour.
30,000 people showed up for the concert.
But Benny didn't.
His plane was delayed by a sandstorm.
So the mob marched on the American embassy.
So they burned down the Coca-Cola plant.
- (tuts)
- You know it.
There was a rhubarb at the home office and I was exiled to South America.
Schlepping that syrup over the Andes on llamas while kids were being promoted over my head.
But you are in Berlin now.
This is not the doghouse.
I used to have nine countries.
Now I've got half a city.
- But... ha-ha! MacNamara rides again.
- (buzzer)
I'll be the white-haired boy now.
I'm going all the way.
Yes?
It's Atlanta.
Hello, Mr Hazeltine? Yes, I can hear you.
- I'm fine. How are you?
- If you must know, I'm miserable.
Those damn magnolias are in bloom again and so is my hay fever.
MacNamara, there's something
I'd like to discuss with you.
I thought you would. You got my teletype?
It's right here in front of me.
Those figures for May are not bad at all.
Thank you, sir.
And how about the Russian deal?
Napoleon blew it, Hitler blew it, but Coca-Cola's gonna pull it off.
Forget it. We are not interested in doing business behind the Iron Curtain.
We're not interested in Russia?
I wouldn't touch them with a ten-foot pole.
And I want nothing to do with Poles either.
But this could be the biggest thing for us since we introduced the six-pack.
- Well, if it's against policy...
- You're damn right.
But that's not what I called about.
I'd like you to do me a personal favour.
You want me to ship Mrs Hazeltine another set of Meissen china?
No, it's about our daughter, Scarlett.
She's 17 now.
Sweet girl. Fell in love with some rock'n'roll singer.
No, that was the one before. This is some pimple-faced basketball player.
Anyway, we sent her off on a little trip to Europe.
- Where was I?
- Scarlett, basketball player, Europe...
Oh, yes. We had her spend a couple of weeks in Rome and a couple in Paris.
She's arriving in Berlin this afternoon.
So if you and Mrs MacNamara...
We'd be delighted to have her stay.
It's just that my family has made plans.
- And I have a few plans of my own.
- If it's any sort of imposition, never mind!
I wasn't thinking of myself.
It's your daughter I'm concerned about.
With the political situation in Berlin the way it is, anything can happen.
Exactly. That's why I want you to take good care of her.
She's just a child really, and I don't like her to stay in a hotel alone.
She's flying Pan Am.
The plane is due in Berlin at 4.30.
Unless those damn commies shoot it down.
(Tannoy) Pan American gibt die Ankunft des Clippers 712 aus Paris bekannt.
- Here. You give her the flowers.
- Cut it out. What was I going to do?
The boss asked me to look after his only daughter.
What about your only children and your only wife? We were ready to go.
- Don't you think we were disappointed?
- We'll just have to put things off.
- The snorkel and the umlaut...
- The what?
The thing is to make sure the girl has a good time so she'll talk about our man in Berlin.
It's such a nuisance. Bertha will have to cook sauerbraten Southern-style.
- Come on, make an effort.
- Yes, mein Führer.
- Is this the Paris plane?
- Oui, monsieur.
- Isn't there a Miss Hazeltine?
- There was, but we have lost her.
- You lost her?
- She has joined the crew.
- Scarlett Hazeltine if I ever saw one.
- (more shrieking)
I'm MacNamara. This is Mrs MacNamara.
- Welcome to Berlin.
- Hi there.
- How was your flight?
- Just marvy.
The boys let me buzz Düsseldorf.
May I have your hat?
OK, fans. Drop 'em in.
- Pick one, will you?
- I'm game.
- What does it say?
- Pierre.
- Where do I pick you up?
- What's our address?
- Why?
- We had this lottery. Pierre won me.
- Lucky Pierre.
- He's the navigator.
You'd better change course.
You're way off the beam.
- This way.
- Just a darn minute.
- So long, fans.
- But that's not fair.
Madame, I appeal to you as a woman.
As a matter of fact, you do. Au revoir.
- You're going to be like that?
- Like what?
A company man like those old poops in Rome and Paris.
Breathing down my neck every minute.
- You're underage and I'm under orders.
- Europe - what a drag.
I've done the Coliseum and the Mona Lisa, but they never take me to any of those marvy places like the Lido and Le Sexy.
- You'll have a wonderful time.
- That's why I came.
- I hear this is a swinging town.
- Where did you hear that?
Don't you ever read the headlines?
Berlin's the hottest spot in the world now.
Care to tell the American
Forces Network?
- Phyllis, please.
- We're a little late, so good night.
This your ticket?
Fritz, mit the luggage machen.
Better cable to tell them
Scarlett's checked in.
Let them worry. I didn't volunteer for this.
They deported me just to bust it up with Choo Choo.
- Who's Choo Choo?
- I met him in a telephone booth.
43 of us piled inside to break the record and Choo Choo and I were on the bottom.
By the time we got out, we were engaged.
- That's a record all right.
- But Daddy didn't approve.
His folks are from the wrong side of the tracks. And my daddy's an S-N-O-B.
- A what?
- A snob.
- Isn't 17 a little young to be engaged?
- I've been engaged four times.
All the women in our family are sort of hot-blooded. (squeaks with laughter)
What have we got here?
Whatever it is, it's all ours for the next two weeks. Isn't that marvy? (mimics laugh)
Schlemmer!
Nein, nein, nein. Nicht aufstehen.
I will keep them after hours practising.
Never mind. My chauffeur didn't show up.
- I will find out what happened to him.
- I don't care about him. Just my car.
Jawohl.
Sorry. While they practise not standing,
I will practise not clicking my heels.
- Guten Morgen.
- Guten Morgen.
Like freshly baked pumpernickel.
Here's your mail, here's your Wall Street
Journal and here is my resignation.
- What are you talking about?
- You do not work me overtime any more.
You have lost all interest in the... umlaut.
Obviously I am no longer required.
We have this house guest.
- You said she would be here two weeks.
- She has German measles.
- She has been now two months.
- She likes it here. What can I do?
- It's August. Won't school soon open?
- In Georgia you never know.
- What is all this about quitting?
- I have had offers. After all, I'm bilingual.
- Don't I know it?
- Those Russians call me all the time.
- They want me very badly.
- I'll bet. Siberian wolves.
So you'd better find another girl.
All right.
Dictation.
Classified ad to run in all Berlin papers. Quote:
Attractive middle-aged executive wants attractive young secretary.
Must be versatile and cooperative.
Excellent salary, congenial working conditions, fringe benefits...
Fringe benefits? What is that?
Little extras. This morning I was passing that shop in the Kurfürstendamm.
There was this white silk dress in the window and a matching hat.
- And a bag? And matching shoes?
- Why not?
- I'll take the job.
- You got it.
- Danke schön.
- You're welcome schön.
Please, not while you're chewing gum.
- That'll be all. More later.
- Any time.
- Yes, Schlemmer?
- I called the garage, his wife... No Fritz.
- You'd better call the police.
- I already did.
Gave them a description of the car.
Model, licence number...
You're a good man.
How much are we paying you?
- 200 Marks a week.
- That would be about $50.
- That's all.
- That's enough.
Hello? Hello, yes?
Atlanta, Georgia? Put it through.
What's going on there in Berlin?
I have a letter here from Scarlett.
Says she's been going to operas, concerts, museums.
- That doesn't sound like my little girl.
- Oh, she's a different person now.
We were a little worried when she first arrived, but she turned out just fine.
Well, I'll be damned!
Anyway, Mrs Hazeltine and I are leaving for Europe today and we'll take her off your hands.
We'll be sorry to lose her. Two weeks, two months. What's the difference?
Well, I want you to know we're mighty grateful to you.
Actually, there's going to be a shift in personnel.
We're naming a new head of European operations - and you won't be forgotten.
The London job?
Well, I don't know what to say.
I never expected anything like that.
Just to be considered is a great honour.
Of course, I've been with the company for
15 years. I know the European market...
- It's your wife on the other phone.
- Not now.
- I told her that, but she insists.
- Hold on, Mr Hazeltine.
There's a little emergency in the accounting department.
- What is it? What's so important?
- If you put it that way, nothing really.
I thought you might be interested in what's going on around the house.
I'm talking to Mr Hazeltine about the
London job. And you want to chitchat?
I'm sorry. It's just that
Miss Hazeltine is missing.
But we can discuss it some other time. Bye.
Bye.
Missing? Wait a minute.
Phyllis! What do you mean missing?
Bertha took her breakfast up and her bed hasn't been slept in.
We got back from the movie round eleven and Scarlett went right upstairs.
- What could have happened?
- Who knows? Gone with the wind.
Maybe she was kidnapped by a white slave ring.
Oh, swell. Hold on.
- Trouble?
- I wish I were in hell with a broken back.
Sorry, Mr Hazeltine. They come running to me with all their little problems.
- What boat are you sailing on?
- Who's got time for that?
Mrs Hazeltine and I are flying to New
York, taking the overnight jet to London, there's a flight to Berlin and we'll be there at noon tomorrow.
Noon tomorrow? You mean our time?
Of course I'll tell Scarlett.
First chance I get.
We'll see you at the airport.
Unless those damn commies shoot the plane down.
Auf Wiedersehen.
We've got to find that idiot.
Her parents are arriving tomorrow.
Where could she be? She doesn't know anybody in Berlin except us.
Have Bertha look again.
Maybe she left a note.
What about her luggage?
I'm glad something is still there.
No, I'm not blaming you.
It's just that lousy MacNamara luck.
First I lost a bottling plant and now I lose the boss's daughter.
I think we are getting some place.
We found Fritz.
To hell with Fritz!
It's the girl we're looking for now.
Precisely. He has some information.
- Where is she?
- I do not know.
Not precisely. But last night
I dropped her at the Brandenburg Gate.
Why?
I drop her there every night and pick her up every morning.
- How long has this been going on?
- Since last month.
Usually I get her back before you wake up but this morning I wait and I wait...
- You've been helping her sneak out?
- Yes, but I have a good excuse.
- What?
- She pays 100 Marks a night.
- 50 for driving, 50 for not telling you.
- Can I fire him?
Not yet. Now let's go step by step.
After you drop her at the gate, what does she do?
- She crosses the border into East Berlin.
- East Berlin?!
That is why I'm so worried because she did not come back.
You're worried? I'm going down in flames and he's worried.
Ingeborg, clear the switchboard.
I want Brigadier-General Hartel.
Next, get me Mayor Willy Brandt. Next, the West Berlin police commissioner.
Next, I want to speak to the US ambassador in Bonn. You got that? OK.
Fritz, you wait downstairs.
Schlemmer, can we get any information from East Berlin?
Only through official channels.
- What if we just picked up the phone?
- It is not that easy.
- Why not?
- There is no direct phone service.
You have to call Stockholm, from there Warsaw, then East Berlin.
Nine times out of ten it's a wrong number.
- Try it anyway.
- Yes, sir.
Schnell machen!
Yes?
General Hartel is on army manoeuvres?
What about Mayor Willy Brandt?
Watching the manoeuvres.
And the police commissioner?
He's watching Willy Brandt.
So who's minding the store?
What about the call to Bonn?
Our ambassador's back in Washington?
Be right with you.
Get me Washington, the state department.
Dean Rusk, Dean Acheson,
Dean Anybody.
If you have no luck there, get me Senator Talmadge.
And if he isn't in, try Huntley and Brinkley at NBC...
- Scarlett!
- What's all the excitement?
Oh, nothing.
You just scared the hell out of us.
- You all right?
- I'm just marvy.
- What were you doing in East Berlin?
- Last night?
All those nights.
You see, there's this boy over there. Wow!
- What boy? What have you been up to?
- I met him about six weeks ago.
I went into East Berlin and there was this parade and they wanted to arrest me.
- Arrest you?
- Cos I was taking pictures.
And then this boy, he was in the parade.
He said I shouldn't be arrested,
I should be pitied cos I was a typical bourgeois parasite and the rotten fruit of a corrupt civilisation.
- So naturally I fell in love with him.
- Naturally.
- Want to see his picture?
- Not particularly.
I want your honest opinion.
Isn't he beautiful?
- You fell in love with Khrushchev?!
- No, silly. The one carrying Khrushchev.
His name's Otto.
I finally got East Berlin and just like I told you, wrong number.
Hi there.
Now, you and this Otto.
Exactly what do you do together?
All kinds of goodies. I wash his shirts and he broadens my mind.
And if it's a warm night we go lie on the roof and watch the Sputniks go by.
- Is that all?
- Last night we were blowing up balloons.
- Balloons?
- You know.
It is a communist trick. They float them across to undermine our morale.
- "Yankee go home"?!
- They come in green, yellow, blue...
You're spreading anti-American propaganda?
It's not anti-American, it's anti-Yankee.
Where I come from everybody's against the Yankees.
I have a good mind to change this to "Russki go home"...
OK, OK. Now you listen to me.
There's going to be no more foolishness.
Tomorrow your parents are taking you home.
- They are?
- (buzzer)
Who?
Chet Huntley? All right, I'll speak to him.
I've been watching your programme.
Keep up the good work. Bye.
When your parents arrive, keep your mouth shut for your sake and mine.
- If they ever find out...
- I'd better talk this over with Otto.
You're not going to see him again.
And you're not going back to East Berlin.
Oh, he's right downstairs.
Otto.
Otto, darling.
Up here.
Come on up, Liebchen.
Liebchen? I don't want that creep in my office.
Send him home to clean out his cage.
He'd better be here, cos we have something to tell you.
Tell me what?
You're not engaged again, are you?
- Not this time.
- Thank God.
- We're married.
- For a minute I was afraid...
- You're married?
- It'll be six weeks on Monday.
- You married a communist?
- No, he's a Republican.
Comes from the Republic of East Germany.
Why, you dumb, stupid little pot.
Do you realise what you've done?
You've ruined me, that's all.
What are your parents going to say?
I trusted you.
Then you go and pull a stunt like this.
Why didn't you look after me better?
15 years with the company down the drain.
I'll be blacklisted. My kids will starve.
My wife will be selling pencils.
And all on account of you and your hot blood.
(Scarlett) Come in. Come in, Otto.
This is Mr MacNamara.
My husband, Otto Ludwig Piffl.
Piffl. Wouldn't you know?
Where did you dig him up?
He doesn't even wear socks.
He doesn't wear shorts either.
Isn't that exciting?
- Take your cap off.
- Why?
Because I said so.
In Lenin's tomb I take my cap off.
If Van Cliburn plays Tchaikovsky,
I take my cap off.
But in Coca-Cola office?
Pfui!
Do it for me, Otto darling.
- For you I do it.
- He could use a haircut.
I'd like to give it to him with a hammer and sickle.
- Warmonger.
- Shut up, you punk.
- Don't talk like that to my husband.
- He's not.
In the first place, she's underage.
Next, we don't recognise East Germany.
Next, while she was washing your shirts you were washing her brain.
- So the whole thing is illegal.
- No, it's not. I have a certificate.
And tell him about the wedding rings.
Forged from the steel of a brave cannon that fought at Stalingrad.
- I don't care. The marriage is illegal.
- You say.
But in the eyes of East Germany we are husband and wife.
You're not in East Germany now.
I can have you arrested for lying on rooftops with a minor.
Of course you can. I know your tactics.
You can have me arrested, tortured or shot.
- Like you've been doing in the Congo.
- Africa for the Africans.
All I want from you is silence and damn little of that.
- Don't you talk like that to my wife.
- (buzzer)
Who? Brinkley? Tell him I already gave the message to Huntley.
Look, Otto baby.
If we're to live in peaceful coexistence, there must be give and take.
- How'd you like 1,000 Marks?
- For what?
Get on your motorcycle and forget the whole thing.
You can't bribe him.
- How about 5,000?
- What are you saying?
- OK, 5,000 Marks.
If it's worth 5,000, why not 50,000?
50,000? You crazy?
I just want to see how far they will go to break up a happy socialist marriage.
I spit on your money.
I spit on Fort Knox. I spit on Wall Street.
- Unsanitary little jerk, isn't he?
- You and your kind are doomed.
We will take over West Berlin and
Western Europe. We will bury you.
Do me a favour, will you?
Bury us, but don't marry us.
Look at all this waste.
Capitalism is like a dead herring in the moonlight.
It shines, but it stinks!
He talks like that all the time.
- Tell him about Coca-Cola colonialism.
- What?
As Khrushchev said on the 40th anniversary of the Revolution...
To hell with the Revolution and Khrushchev!
To hell with Frank Sinatra.
It's going to be a clambake when your folks get here.
- How are we going to explain this?
- That's your problem. I won't be here.
- What do you mean?
- Tonight my wife and I leave for Moscow.
- Moscow?
- That's what I came to tell you.
He's got a scholarship to the People's Technological Institute.
- He's studying to be a missile engineer.
- Soviet missiles...
Venus.
American missiles...
Miami Beach.
So you just tell Daddy
I'm on my way to the USSR.
That's short for Russia.
Are you out of your mind?
Russia's to get out of, not to get into.
- Where Otto goes, I go.
- You just try to stop us.
- Can you talk to your wife?
- I certainly can't talk to them.
On this phone.
- Hello? Yes, dear.
- I bet I know what happened to Scarlett.
- Lucky Pierre must be back in town.
- It's not lucky Pierre. It's crazy Otto.
Are you ready for this? She's married.
That's right. She got herself an ever-lovin', curly-haired, card-carrying husband.
She married a communist?
This is going to be the biggest thing to hit Atlanta since General Sherman.
No, I don't think it's funny.
They're going to live in Moscow?
Now, that's funny.
Yeah, hysterical. But what can I do, go fight the Kremlin?
I can't stop them. They're young, they're in love and we're a dead herring.
So who am I to stand in the way of a happy socialist marriage?
Come off it. I know you.
You've got something up your sleeve.
I wouldn't be surprised. Bye.
- Now, what time are you kids leaving?
- Seven o'clock on the Moscow express.
- Why do you want to know?
- I'm going to dynamite the train.
What makes you guys so suspicious?
I'd better get back and start packing.
Think I ought to take both my mink coats?
No woman should have two mink coats until every woman in the world has one.
Cut the other one up and make him a pair of shorts. It's freezing there.
- 30 below zero.
- Fascist lies.
- You'd better go home and pack too.
- It will take no time.
Just my chessboard, my extra shirt and 200 books.
As smiley is going back to East Berlin,
I'll get the car for you.
Schlemmer, will you run and tell Fritz he'll have to take Scarlett home?
- You are letting her go?
- In a pig's eye.
His motorcycle is downstairs. Remember that idea you had about the balloon?
Just think, Liebchen. Tomorrow night we'll be strolling across Red Square.
- I hope you won't be ashamed of me.
- Of course not.
I'll only wear my jewellery at home.
They have assigned us a magnificent apartment.
- Just a short walk from the bathroom.
- I love you.
I'll make you happy. Every morning we'll have breakfast in bed.
- Sounds wonderful.
- Also lunch, also dinner.
- In bed?
- There's no table and no chairs.
Who cares?
I'll pick you up at 6.30 sharp.
The 7.00 train leaves promptly at 8.15.
Wait. Before you go
I'd like to give you a present.
- Why?
- It's customary.
Otto's friends didn't give us presents.
They sent the money to unemployed cotton pickers in Mississippi.
How about a cocktail shaker?
No, I guess not.
I know.
A cuckoo clock.
Handmade by dwarves from the Black Forest.
- So now they're exploiting dwarves.
- Sorry I haven't got any wrapping paper.
We do not want anything from you.
Otto, don't be rude.
I think it's very sweet of Mr MacNamara.
- Now we'll have a bed and a clock.
- We will get our own clock in Russia.
If your clocks run like your trains, you might as well take this one.
You laugh at us now, but not for long.
You're arrogant and fat and bloated.
The worms will have a picnic.
See you on the barricades, pal.
- I'll put in a good word for you.
- Scarlett.
It's my parents I feel sorry for.
It's too late to save them.
Otto says they'll have to be liquidated.
Bye.
Schlemmer.
Hurry up.
- Wiedersehen, Liebchen.
- Auf Wiedersehen.
- Good boy, Schlemmer.
- Anything else you wish me to do?
No, thanks. We can let the East German police finish the job.
Pardon me, but I do not understand any of this.
All it takes is a little knowledge of physics and elementary psychology.
Right now Comrade Otto Ludwig Piffl is tooling along on his motorcycle toward East Berlin, gay, chipper, feeling like a million roubles.
Little does he know that back at the exhaust the fumes are filling the balloon.
It gets bigger and bigger.
And all the time in the sidecar a little booby trap is ticking away.
Now, if my calculations are correct, all these things will pay off once he passes through the Brandenburg Gate.
- Was haben Sie da?
- Keine Ahnung.
- Ich sehe das Ding zum ersten Mal.
- Papiere.
Was ist in dem Paket? Was tikt denn da?
Das ist Kukuksuhr. Habe ich es als
Hochzeitsgeschenk bekommen.
Tatsächlich? Eine Kukuksurhr.
Mensch. Sie schmuggeln amerikanische Propokanda?
Ich? Davon hab' ich nichts gewusst.
Ich dachte, es ist eine Kukuksuhr.
Ich konnte nicht wissen was es war.
Sehen Sie mal das an?
Wall Street Journal.
- Wall Street? Sie sind verhaftet.
- Das ist Wahnsinn. Ich bin unschuldig.
Ich bin Mitglied der
Kommunistiches Partei.
Genossen. Bruder.
Lang lebe die Revolution.
You can forward my mail care of American Express.
And Vogue magazine.
And Screen Romances.
If you promise to send me Pravda.
Just the funnies.
He should be here by now.
What time is it?
6.25. Relax.
- Danke schön.
- Don't mention it.
- Are you sure you want to leave her that?
- Oh, yes.
- Otto says every woman should have one.
- I'm with Otto.
Well, maybe she'll let me borrow it on my night out.
Do you realise that Otto spelt backwards is Otto?
- How about that?
- He looks just like Jack Kennedy.
Only he's younger.
And he has more upstairs.
- More brains?
- More hair.
And ideologically he's much sounder.
- Maybe we voted for the wrong man.
- That couldn't happen in Russia.
- They don't make mistakes?
- They don't vote.
Have you ever made love to a revolutionary?
No, but I once necked with a Stevenson Democrat.
Well, I've been engaged four times so I know about men.
Those subversives, they're the wildest.
No contest.
And I just thought we were lagging behind in missiles.
Hiya, girls. Was ist cooking?
Bertha, take Miss Hazeltine's luggage back upstairs.
- Back upstairs? She's leaving.
- I wouldn't count on it.
- Bourbon and soda, anyone?
- What's he talking about?
- Otto's coming to pick me up any minute.
- No, he's not.
Otto's been picked up himself by the police.
- Police? What for?
- Who knows?
They toss people in jail like we throw away Kleenex.
- In jail?
- How do you know?
- Bad news travels fast. Say when.
- Where is he? I must go to him.
- He's in trouble enough already.
- But he's my husband. I want to help him.
We all do. That's why we have to get the marriage annulled.
- Now wait a minute.
- Look.
If they find he's married to the parasite daughter of an American capitalist, they'll send him up for 20 years.
Slaving in the salt mines, schlepping heavy bags barefoot through the snow with nothing to keep him warm but the hot breath of the Cossacks.
Otto!
Nice work, Mac.
Scarlett. Scarlett.
- Try some ice.
- Bertha, call Dr Bauer, will you?
I will call the doctor, but I will not give back the mink coat.
(hums theme from
Wagner's "The Valkyrie")
Die Temparatur, she is normal.
Der Puls... (tuts)
- What's the matter?
- I missed the first act of "The Valkyrie".
Der Puls, he is normal.
Das ist definitely nicht normal.
I'll fix that.
Shh!
Cut it out, kids. Scarlett is sick.
If she dies, can I have my room back?
(MacNamara) How would I know?
I'm not a lawyer. That's your job.
What am I paying you for? You must have some contacts in East Berlin.
I don't want the marriage just annulled,
I want it wiped off the books.
I don't care how you do it.
Bribe one of the clerks. Destroy the files.
If you could burn down the Reichstag, you can set a match to a marriage certificate.
And it has to be done tonight.
- Cheers.
- Feeling pretty good, aren't you?
- Not bad.
- You framed that poor boy.
You bet. I'm not going to let that kook ruin somebody's life.
- But she loves him.
- Not her life, mine.
I'm all set for the London job.
I couldn't care less. I'm fed up with this.
Hopping all around the map from Baghdad to Caracas to Cape Town.
- Who needs it?
- What would you suggest?
A nice permanent job with the home office in Atlanta.
Atlanta? You can't be serious.
That's Siberia with mint juleps.
- I want to go home.
- Give me one good reason.
Cindy has to have her teeth straightened.
Tommy is ten and he's never had a peanut-butter sandwich.
And I'd like to see Gunsmoke not in
German or Portuguese or Swahili.
You want to go home and pay taxes?
We've got it made.
Big house, servants, limousine. And you'd give it up for a peanut-butter sandwich?
It's a great life for you.
Everywhere we go you find some secretary who gives language lessons.
- What does that mean?
- I can always tell.
You start wearing your elevator shoes.
- Are you implying?
- I've known for years.
And you never said? That's not fair.
I didn't want to be one of those nagging American wives.
But maybe I was wrong. Maybe we should have had it out a long time ago.
- How is she?
- Perfectly normal.
She keeps asking for somebody named Otto.
- Never heard of him.
- She's going to be all right?
Hundert Prozent. You will be happy to know that the young lady is...
How do you say it in English? Schwanger.
- What's that?
- You're the one studying German.
You know. Such a Dummkopf I am.
Schwanger, schwanger...
I know what it means.
- What?
- You told me not to use words like that.
- Come on.
- Do you want me to tell you?
- (Phyllis) Please.
- Scarlett's going to have puppies.
- What?
- Pregnant?
That is the word! Pregnant.
Auf Wiedersehen.
(to Valkyrie melody) Schwanger is pregnant, pregnant is schwanger
Mother of Mercy, is this the end of little Rico?
All right, children, back to your room.
Get ready for bed.
- I wonder what it's like to work for Pepsi.
- Please, Phyllis.
So tomorrow Mr and Mrs Hazeltine will arrive at the airport.
And there will be little Scarlett - unchanged, unspoiled, unwed.
- Just slightly schwanger. Cheers.
- I'm trying to think.
Think fast, because there'll be a few questions asked. Like who's the father?
- I'll have answers when the time comes.
- Better have Otto when the time comes.
Otto? That would be disaster.
Let me see. She was secretly married.
To somebody in the American embassy.
On honeymoon in the Alps he was killed by an avalanche.
Nah, that's no good.
He was sent on a mission behind the Iron Curtain. Never heard from again.
The whole thing was so secret we can't even mention his name.
Now you're running amok.
You think Scarlett will stand still for?
Better a dead hero than a live communist.
I'll pick up a Distinguished Service Medal.
It was awarded to him posthumously.
And while you're at it, pin one on yourself.
First-Class Heel, with oak-leaf cluster.
What can I do? I had enough trouble getting the guy into jail.
It's going to be ten times as tough to get him out.
- Schlemmer.
- (click!)
Don't click your heels.
I'm going to need you tonight.
I'll pick you up in exactly ten minutes.
Call Ingeborg. Tell her it's an emergency.
We'll pick her up in exactly 12 minutes.
- Wo fahren Sie hin? Papiere.
- American citizen.
- What is purpose of your visit?
- I'm seeing Commissar Peripetchikoff.
- What for?
- On business. I represent Coca-Cola.
Coca-Cola? You have proof?
Will this do?
- I confiscate proof.
- Just return the empties.
OK. Proceed.
If I may say so, this whole idea is crazy.
It will not work. I can feel it.
And I'm scared.
- Pull yourself together. That's an order.
- Yes, sir.
I'm scared also.
Not for myself. I only worry something will happen to my new dress.
I'll buy you half a dozen.
- They're at the Hotel Potemkin. Know it?
- Yes, sir.
It used to be the Hotel Goering.
And before that it was the Hotel Bismarck.
(sings "Yes, We Have
No Bananas" in German)
Hey!
- Gospodin MacNamara.
- If it isn't Hart, Schaffner and Karl Marx.
- I see you bring blonde lady.
- Ring-a-ding-ding.
Sit down, my friends. Join us.
- Right here, Fräulein.
- I said Karl Marx, not Groucho.
- To what we owe this pleasure?
- I thought we might trade.
- Coca-Cola?
- No. You'd like Ingeborg to work for you.
- Want to trade her?
- Right.
- For Russian one?
- Wrong.
I do not blame you.
Ours is built like bow-legged samovar.
We find proposition very interesting.
Now what can we offer you?
- All I want from you is a small favour.
- Small, big. Anything.
There's a guy named Piffl.
He's being held by the police.
- For what reason?
- Stole my cuckoo clock.
- You want clock back?
- Wrong.
- You want Piffl back.
- Right.
Impossible. We cannot interfere with internal affairs of East Germany.
- No Piffl, no deal. Let's go.
- Wait. You're not giving us a chance.
Is old Russian proverb. You cannot milk cow with hands in pockets.
Herr Ober. Vodka, caviar.
Herr Kapellmeister. More rock'n'roll!
You like this caviar?
We give you a hundred pounds.
I want Piffl.
Would you take new automobile?
1961 Moskvich convertible, two-tone.
- You mean that Russian hot rod outside?
- Is wonderful car.
- Is exact copy of 1937 Nash.
- Not interested.
We will give you Chinese cigarettes,
Armenian rugs.
- Bulgarian yoghurt?
- Piffl or nothing.
I know what. We have warehouse full of Spam left over from lend-lease.
It's five o'clock and we're getting nowhere. Ingeborg, put your shoes on.
One more minute, please.
Summit conference.
Before we make deal we want right of inspection.
- I veto it.
- I thought so.
Well, what are we going to do?
He's got it, we want it.
Are we going to accept this blackmailing deal?
- Let us vote.
- I vote yes.
- I vote yes.
- Two out of three. Deal is on.
Comrades, I must warn you.
I'm not really from soft-drinks secretariat.
I am undercover agent assigned to watch you.
- In that case I vote no. Deal is off.
- But I vote yes.
Two out of three again. Deal is on.
OK, kids, strip for action.
("Itsy Bitsy Teenie Weenie
Yellow Polka-Dot Bikini")
Nein, nein.
Genug, aufhören!
Hör' auf! Ich will schlafen.
Ich will schlafen. Lass mich nur schlafen!
- Sind Sie ein amerikanischer Spion?
- Nein.
- Fur wem arbeiten Sie? CIA?
- Nein. Ich will schlafen.
- Sind Sie ein amerikanischer Spion?
- Nein.
- Sind Sie ein Geheimagent von Dulles?
- Nein, nein.
Lass mich schlafen. Ich will nur schlafen.
Aufhören! Aufhören!
Ich halte das nicht mehr aus. Ich gestehe.
Ich gestehe! Ich gestehe!
- Sie gestehen was?
- Alles.
- Sind Sie ein amerikanischer Spion?
- Ja, ich bin ein amerikanischer Spion.
Ja, ich arbeite fur die CIA.
Ja, ich bin von Wall Street bezahlt.
Ja, ich bin ein Geheimagent von Allen Dulles. Ja, ja, ja!
Unterschreiben.
Borodenko. Geheimen Russiche Polizei.
Haben Sie ein Piffl?
- Jawohl.
- Wir nehmen ihn gleich mit.
Hier ist sein Geständnis.
Er ist amerikanischer Spion.
Amerikanischer Spion?
Moment.
Did you hear that?
He is a confessed American spy.
Then I want nothing to do with it.
If they find out in Moscow...
- He's right. No secretary's worth that risk.
- Why should they find out in Moscow?
- I will not inform.
- But if they do.
- Then we just cross into West Berlin.
- Easy for you to say. You're a bachelor.
But if I defect, you know what they will do to my family?
They will line them up and shoot them.
My wife and my mother-in-law and my sister-in-law and my brother-in-law...
Comrades, let's do it.
You try to bamboozle us. You say he's cuckoo clock thief. He's American spy.
- Ich bin ein amerikanischer Spion.
- Shh!
You better get him out of here before we all get into trouble.
- A pleasure to do business with you boys.
- Wait. Where is blonde lady?
I'll send her right over.
You poor baby.
- Did you hurt yourself?
- Let me help you.
He bamboozled us again.
(Russian)... Brandenburg Gate.
Those Russians - I hope they were not too disappointed.
- That's their problem.
- Actually, they were cute.
I can't decide which one I liked best, the big fat one or the bald one.
That's Schlemmer's problem.
Fritz, what's that behind us?
- Looks like a 1937 Nash.
- OK, step on it.
Halt!
- We came through earlier.
- You wait.
Ich bin ein amerikanischer Spion.
Here is empties.
Aufhalten!
Aufhalten! Ich sagte aufhalten.
Let's go, Fritz.
Aufhalten!
Aufhalten! Aufhalten!
Aufthalten!
Ltsy bitsy teenie weenie yellow polka-dot bikini
Drop dead.
That's enough. Cut it out.
Why are you so unfriendly?
I thought everything was wunderbar.
Some wunderbar! Can you imagine what's going to happen at noon when the Hazeltines step off that plane and get a load of their new son-in-law?
You slob.
And when he opens his big fat
Red mouth, it's goodbye, Charlie.
- Who is Charlie?
- Charles H Kaput.
- I wish Scarlett would get here.
- I wish Schlemmer would get here.
Or send my dress back.
- What do you want in it? Cream, sugar?
- Benzedrine. It's going to be a rough day.
You better put something on.
Your goose pimples are showing.
That's nothing. You should see my sister.
- Where is he?
- Scarlett.
I've got to talk to you.
There's only one way out of this mess.
Otto. Otto, darling.
Otto, it's me, Scarlett.
Otto. Otto, darling, wake up.
- Scarlett?
- I've something very exciting to tell you.
How did I get here?
You! I should take that wedding present and break it over your head.
That's gratitude after I got you out of jail.
- You got me into jail.
- So we're even.
- When you didn't show up I fainted.
- It's all his fault.
- Not entirely.
- Want to hear what the doctor said?
- He'll need coffee.
- From you I don't need anything.
- I'm going to have a baby.
- If my wife wasn't going to have a baby...
- What?
- That's right.
Liebchen!
That's just what the world needs.
Another bouncing baby Bolshevik.
- I was so afraid you wouldn't want it.
- I want dozens.
- So do I.
- So does the Party. They encourage it.
- We must outproduce the West!
- I hear they got a new plan now.
Instead of a woman taking nine months, nine women are going to do it in one.
The minute we arrive we must get on the waiting list for the people's obstetrician.
No, I'd like to fly over my own doctor.
And my old nurse and my governess.
What for? The state takes care of everything.
At six months the baby will be enrolled in the people's nursery school.
Naturally we will visit every other Sunday.
- Every other Sunday?!
- You can bring him some Pablum.
With a file in it.
Imperialist stooge.
And of course we'll see him on May Day.
He'll be marching by in the parade.
We can wave to him.
You can also wave to him on Lenin's birthday and on Yuri Gagarin's birthday.
- He'll be parading all the time.
- At least it'll keep him off the streets.
The tickets.
Where are the tickets? We must find out when the next train leaves for Moscow.
Forget it, Piffl.
You're not going to Moscow.
You can't even get back to East Berlin.
- Why not?
- Because you're an American spy.
- Who said so?
- You did. Don't you remember last night?
You signed a confession.
Ein amerikanischer Spion.
Nein.
- Nein, nein, nein.
- Ja. Ja, ja, ja.
Isn't that thrilling, darling?
Why didn't you tell me?
But I'm...
I'm not a spy. It's not true.
Makes you think about those other confessions.
Another hour and they'd have had you confessing to germ warfare in Laos.
- You did this to me.
- Or was it your communist chums?
We'll tell them it was a trick.
Think they'd believe me, an imperialist stooge?
- I shall kill you.
- Easy, or you'll end up in the people's ER.
Otto, darling.
What are we going to call the baby?
My dress. What did you do to my dress?
- Schlemmer.
- Yes, sir?
- I'm sorry I didn't shave this morning.
- My dress! It's ruined.
- Any trouble getting out of East Berlin?
- I had trouble in West Berlin.
I was picked up by an American soldier in a Jeep.
Wanted to take my picture for something called Playboy.
- Get out of those silly clothes.
- Yes, sir. If I can have my suit?
It's in your office.
And it's going to be such fun shopping.
We need a bassinet and a layette.
And we have to run down to Paris.
They have marvy maternity clothes at Christian Dior's.
Forget all that.
We can't even afford milk for the baby.
The doctors have a whole new theory.
Milk's the worst thing for babies.
Don't you understand?
I'm through, finished, ausgespielt.
To the communists I'm a spy, to the Americans I'm a communist.
I've nothing. No home, no job...
- Not even my motorcycle.
- That's tough. All you got is a rich wife.
In January when I'm 18 Daddy's giving me
10,000 shares of Coca-Cola stock.
I'm a worker, not a gigolo.
- I will not take money from you.
- You bet you won't.
When your father finds out he'll cut you off without a red cent.
- Pardon the expression.
- I guess so.
Daddy has a fit every time I order anything with Russian dressing.
Looks bad, doesn't it?
But I'm going to help you.
- If idiot boy here will cooperate.
- You go to hell.
Long distance.
Mr Hazeltine calling from London.
London? Uh-oh.
The bloodhounds are closing in.
Hello? Yes, this is MacNamara.
I'm going to have your head for this.
What do you mean for what? We get off at London and there's this telegram.
"Congratulations, you're going to be a grandfather". Signed MacNamara.
- Is this your idea of a joke?
- No, it's not my idea of a joke.
- Did somebody cable your father?
- Yes. Mrs MacNamara.
Oh, she did?
Yes, it's true. We didn't want you to be too surprised when you got here.
I send you a sweet, pure, innocent girl who isn't even 18 yet, and...
What?
- It's all right, Melanie. She's married.
- Oh, thank heaven.
Wait a minute, MacNamara. Not so fast.
Just exactly who is she married to?
I wouldn't worry about it.
He's a wonderful boy.
Handsome and from one of Europe's best families. You'll be crazy about him.
Yes, sir. We'll bring him along to the airport with us. Happy landing.
Schlemmer.
- What are you up to now?
- You can't fool Daddy that easy.
- I didn't say it'd be easy, but we can try.
- Try what?
To turn this crumbum into a perfect son-in-law.
We've got three hours and two minutes.
- Oh, I get it. Isn't he clever?
- Schlemmer!
I categorically refuse!
Sorry, sir. I had difficulty getting out of the girdle.
I want all those people out there to stand by for orders.
- General alarm. Complete mobilisation.
- Like the good old days! Yes, sir.
I will not be a party to this.
- OK, if you don't love your wife...
- I worship her!
There's nothing I wouldn't do for you, but I will not compromise my principles.
And I'd do anything for you, even if we had to starve together.
But we can't ask the baby to starve.
Not at his age.
You're upsetting your wife.
I will not be turned into a capitalist!
Once you are in good standing
I don't care what you do.
You can steal our formula and square yourself with Moscow.
But at noon today you are going to look and act like a gentleman.
Everybody at their posts awaiting orders.
First, get a barber and a manicurist up to the office.
Next, I want my lawyer. Next, I want to speak to the manager of the Berlin Hilton.
Next, get ahold of that moth-eaten count from the Café Wien.
- Count von Droste-Schattenburg?
- That's him. I want to see him.
And send Ingeborg in mit pad and pencil.
Schnell machen. One, two, three!
- Jawohl.
- All right, next.
- Clean him up. Over there.
- I've agreed to nothing.
Is it against the party line to use indoor plumbing?
It won't hurt a bit.
Even if it hurts - mit the hot water, mit the soap.
- Yes, Mr MacNamara?
- Ready?
Always ready.
First, call Reinhardt and Reinhardt, tailors.
Have them send everything they've got.
Single-breasted, three-button, narrow lapels, dark blue, size... 39 regular.
Next, call Pleschke the haberdasher.
I want shirts:
Broadcloth, plain or tab collars, size... 15½ /34.
Shorts: Nylon or cotton, size 32.
Socks: French lisle, dark tone, size 11 ½.
Ties: Not too wide, not too narrow.
Also, pyjamas, handkerchiefs, etc, etc.
Next have Hochstätter's deliver shoes.
British or Italian, brown or black, size 9B.
Yes, Fritz. No, Fritz. I need you.
Sleepy or not, everybody works today.
Next, call any first-class hatter.
I want an assortment of hats, size 7½.
Correction. After we cut his hair, 7½.
Next, call that store on Tauentzienstraße for a matched set of men's luggage.
Next, call the Ritz jewellers. I want to see wedding rings, also engagement rings.
No less than two carats.
Make sure he scrubs behind his ears.
Next, have Kottler's restaurant send up a seven-course dinner and table setting.
Next, have a florist make up a bouquet.
Also, two boutonnieres, white carnations.
- Any questions?
- Yes.
- Can I go home and get some clothes?
- At a time like this?
Dressed or not dressed, everybody works. Get with it.
- Haare schneiden?
- Maniküre?
- Not me, him. Chop that mop off.
- Jawohl.
- And give him a shave and a manicure.
- No!
- What do you mean no?
- No manicure.
It's a symbol of bourgeois insecurity.
In Russia they're so secure they chew their nails off.
Nobody will ever know.
You can wear gloves.
Gloves? Why don't you ask me to wear striped pants?
Ingeborg, I also want some striped pants, a morning coat and a white waistcoat.
I have located the count. He's working in the men's room at the Kempinski Hotel.
- How soon can he get here?
- He wants to know if you can come there.
- Absolutely not.
- I'll tell him. Your lawyer is here.
Come in.
Ah, Herr MacNamara.
Isn't this a glorious day?
Cut the schmooze.
Here's what I want you to do.
It has already been done. The young lady can consider herself unmarried.
Unmarried?!
I managed to liberate that marriage licence from the files in East Berlin.
It's that damn German efficiency.
That's all I need. An illegitimate baby.
- I beg your pardon?
- Ich bringe die Schuhe.
Unpack them.
Go back to East Berlin and put that marriage licence back in the file.
- If you say so.
- But first, draw up adoption papers.
- For the baby?
- No, Otto Ludwig Piffl.
We're going to have him adopted by a real aristocrat.
- Oh, a baron?
- Better.
The men's room attendant at the Kempinski.
- Who?
- Leave the name blank for now.
Get to work.
Next, shoes. No, no, nothing with tassels.
Those are all right.
Alligator? That's for band leaders.
Those are OK, OK...
- Totally unacceptable. Full of holes.
- Guten Morgen. Reinhardt.
Be right with you.
I'll take those, but not those.
- What have we here?
- Latest styles. All fabrics imported.
They look deported. Too loud, too quiet...
All right, but take the padding out of the shoulders. That's not bad.
Belt on the back?
That went out with high-button shoes.
- I have some here.
- Take that into the conference room.
I want these in 24 hours.
Where's the morning coat and pants?
- My assistant is bringing them.
- Fit those now.
- Schmuck.
- What did you say?
- Schmuck jewellery.
- Oh.
Come with me. You too.
Sitzen machen.
A strong, healthy girl like you should be cutting wheat in the Ukraine.
Leave it a little longer on the sides.
Like Sal Mineo.
- Pick two wedding rings.
- Left foot.
- Do you like these?
- Gold? Never.
I prefer the steel of Stalingrad.
You guys are always yakking about disarmament. Might as well start now.
- Up.
- He's giving you an engagement ring.
- He is?
- I am?
- Too big.
- I assume the gentleman will wear socks.
- Not if I can help it.
- Waist 31.
- Sit down.
- I want this one.
- How much?
- 8,000 Marks.
- Thank you.
- Wait. Who's paying for this foolishness?
Relax, you've got assets.
So I sit on my assets and clip coupons?
The baby will clip coupons.
We'll put the money in his name.
Sit down.
I won't have my son grow up a capitalist.
When he's 18 he can decide if he wants to be a capitalist or a rich communist.
Yes? The manager of the Berlin Hilton?
Put him on.
Over there.
I want to reserve the bridal suite.
Yes, checking in today.
I didn't ask you how much it costs.
This is for the son-in-law of a millionaire.
- Double bed, silk sheets...
- We don't need a table and chairs.
- We're going to have all our meals in bed.
- Never mind sheets. Make it a tablecloth.
Silk sheets, diamond rings, bridal suites.
What is this? La dolce vita?
Hey, what are you doing?
Stop it. Are you crazy?
- The haberdasher is in your office.
- Keep an eye on the Kremlin Kid.
- There's a newspaperman to see you.
- Not today.
Sitzen machen.
- No, white shirts only. French cuff.
- Jawohl.
Socks fine. If he objects, we'll paint his feet black.
- Where's the pyjamas?
- Here.
- OK. What's this?
- They're beautiful.
They are terrible. Let's see the ties.
Jawohl, nix, jawohl, definitely nix.
This is the best.
- It is mine.
- Take it off. I'm buying it.
- Good morning.
- Looks like Macy's basement.
- It's a rat race around here.
- And I know the rat.
- This robe is jawohl or nix?
- I'll be right with you.
Don't bother. I just want something from the safe.
- What's the combination?
Throw that robe in and take the stuff into the conference room.
Don't tell the guy in there they're French cuffs. Not with the Algerian situation.
- What are you looking for?
- Here they are.
- The passports.
- Passports?
I'm flying home and I'm taking the kids.
- You're what?
- You heard.
What are you sore about?
I got Otto back. I'm remodelling him.
Somebody should do a job on you.
Goodbye, Mac.
- You can't walk out on me like this.
- I'm not. I'm going back where I belong.
Any time you care to join us, we'll be waiting.
- The adoption papers. They are ready.
- Raus!
What's come over you? After 16 years?
Maybe after 16 years every marriage gets stale. Like a leftover glass of beer.
Can't we discuss this without bringing up a rival beverage?
I hope these vaccinations are still good.
You knew the kind of guy I was when you married me.
- Apparently not.
- I'm not one of those suburban jokers.
Nine to five in the office, cut the grass every weekend.
Turns out I married Marco Polo.
It wasn't all that bad. We've had some fun.
Remember Teheran when Cindy was born?
Driving 12 miles to the hospital on a Coca-Cola truck?
Some fun!
And remember when I had Tommy?
- Right in the Zürich airport.
- We had a hell of a time leaving Customs.
How about our honeymoon?
That week in Waikiki.
Yeah. Me upstairs putting perfume behind my ears.
You downstairs at a soft-drink convention.
400 men running around in grass skirts.
I should have said aloha then and there.
Be a good girl and give me those.
Let's talk this over.
- All right, I'm willing.
- (whirring)
But not right now. I've got a deadline.
You've got a deadline with me.
Baby, I love you.
Everything is going to be fine.
In London Tommy can go to Oxford.
Cindy can see the changing of the guard.
We can afford one of those snooty butlers.
Kippers for breakfast. Riding to hounds.
I will not be caught dead in striped pants.
They're for bankers and war profiteers.
They were ordered by the ambassador from the People's Republic of Yugoslavia.
We will deal with Tito when the time comes.
- Take them off. They're too big.
- In front of the lady?
Oh, yeah, I forgot. He doesn't wear shorts.
- No wonder they're winning the Cold War.
- All right, in the other room.
Don't go away, Phyllis.
Ingeborg, get him some shorts.
Sitzen machen.
- Good morning, Mrs MacNamara.
- Guten Morgen.
Shorts, let me see. Where are the shorts?
You could use some yourself.
- Oh. I don't come in like this every day.
- That's a load off my mind.
It's just that Mr MacNamara made me take my dress off.
- Playful, isn't he?
- He had a perfect right to. He paid for it.
- Well, that makes all the difference!
- It's part of my job.
What you call... fringe benefits. (titters)
How do you like that?
The son of a... is starting his own Marshall Plan.
Oh, here.
- I go now.
- Ve both go now.
Will you give my husband a message?
Tell him I said aloha.
- Aloha?
- That's Hawaiian for "Get lost".
- What's holding up those shorts?
- Here. Your wife said to tell you aloha.
That's Hawaiian for "Get lost".
Phyllis!
Phyllis.
Phyllis.
- The dinner. Where do you want it?
- In the conference room.
- Phyllis.
- My name is Untermeier.
- I'm from the Tageblatt.
- Some other time.
We have information that Miss Hazeltine of Coca-Cola married a member of the Communist Party.
Sitzen machen.
I will not wear these.
They serve no useful purpose.
It's just a convention. Back home we put panties on lamb chops.
- They are drip-dry. 50 per cent nylon.
- That's DuPont. A well-known monopoly.
They're 50 per cent cotton.
It'll help sharecroppers in Mississippi.
- Sit down. Let's see how you eat.
- Eat? That's the first good idea he's had.
- I'm starving.
- Not like that. Start with the first course.
We have to teach him table manners.
No, no, one at a time.
And use the asparagus tongs, darling.
- The what?
- Those little grabbers over there.
- Why can't I have my chicken?
- Luggage.
OK, take those over to the Hilton.
- You want initials on the bags?
- He doesn't even have a name yet.
No, no, no, no.
He's right, darling.
Always white wine with chicken.
Out of a glass, stupid.
Ja, you know everything. Which wine to drink, which fork to use for fish.
Which knife to stab the proletariat in the back with.
How would you like a little fruit?
The count is waiting in the office.
- Scarlett, keep working on him.
- Darling, use the finger bowl.
- Don't pack his old clothes.
- What shall we do with them?
- Burn them, but first disinfect them.
- Wait.
My Party membership book is in there.
I'm paid up till December.
Sitzen machen. Hello, there.
- Waldemar von Droste-Schattenburg.
- MacNamara von Omaha, Nebraska.
Would you tell me why I was summoned?
Every minute I am away from my post it costs me two Marks in tips.
OK. How would you like to become a father?
- At my age?
- I'd like you to adopt a young man.
And the tip is 2,000 Marks.
- Good day, sir.
- Hold on.
Just because I'm reduced to earning my living in a washroom does not mean that I am willing to peddle the dignity of my family name.
We date back to the Second Crusade.
We have one of the oldest bloodlines in Europe and one of the most inbred.
I am a direct descendant of Philip the Bleeder.
So your proposition is not only preposterous, it is highly insulting.
- Make it 10,000.
- I'll give you 3,000.
I come from a long line of bleeders.
- Don't cut the price.
I will have you know that I'm distantly related to ex-King Farouk of Egypt.
- What happened to 4,000?
It's a deal.
Send Piffl in.
For an additional 500 Marks
I will include the family crest.
Cakes of soap in a field of paper towels?
A porcupine, rampant on a field of fleur-de-lys.
You may also have a photograph of the Schattenburg Castle.
Unfortunately destroyed during the war.
- American Air Force?
- No, Turkish cavalry. 1683.
You can't just order me around.
Sit there, do this, eat that.
Hold still. I can't get your cuff link in.
- Is this the lucky young man?
- That's him.
- Meet your father.
- My father?
My dear boy. I'm sure you will be a credit to the family.
It could use a little credit.
- What is this?
- You're being adopted.
Adopted? Just like that, without even asking me?
This is not only devious, it's unilateral.
- My eye.
- This is your daughter-in-law.
- Gnädige Frau.
- Scarlett!
- I've got something in my eye.
- It's a monocle. Looks cute on you.
A monocle. How sneaky can you get?
Sign the papers and give this to the cashier.
Thank you.
- What do you think you're doing?
- It's on the house.
Goodbye, my son.
I want you kids to memorise your new name.
You are the Count and Countess von Droste-Schattenburg.
- Count?
- So everyone has to curtsy to me.
- Except maybe Grace Kelly.
- Nobody will curtsy to you.
I refuse to join the aristocracy.
They're all leeches, bleeding the masses.
Not the von Droste-Schattenburgs.
They bleed themselves.
Get him dressed. And now he has a name, there are some things I want him to sign.
- What things?
- I'm turning over my limousine to you.
- All I want is my motorcycle back.
- Can't have a countess in a sidecar.
- Where would we put the baby?
- And have him fill out these.
Golf club, Diners Club,
Book-of-the-Month Club...
- I will sign nothing, I will join nothing.
- But it's the American way of life.
Unemployment, discrimination, gangsterism, juvenile delinquency...
But under our new 20-year plan we will catch up with you.
Lots of luck.
Ingeborg, get the manager of the bottling plant up here and find me a sign painter.
What MPs?
- What can I do for you?
- You the head man?
- That's me.
- We had a report.
You got a female employee who's an enemy agent.
Enemy agent?
What would you call a dame with
"Yankee go home" tattooed on her chest?
- Somebody's pulling your leg.
- Maybe, maybe not.
- Mind if we look around?
- Be my guest.
Oh. OK, buster.
Let's go.
You sent for me?
As manager of the bottling plant you always need more help.
- Yes, sir.
- Cheer up. You're getting an assistant.
- Who?
- You.
The new manager is Otto von Droste-Schattenburg.
- I refuse.
- Your pay will be higher.
- I accept.
- Into the conference room.
You've got 15 minutes to teach this guy everything you know.
- I can't thank you enough.
- Out.
Bertha, let me talk to Mrs MacNamara.
She left? Mit die Kinder?
Where did they go?
Into a taxi. Thanks a lot!
I don't want to take up your time, so if you let me talk to Miss Hazeltine...
- About what?
- About her marriage to that communist.
- I'd like a statement for the story.
- There is no story and no communist.
- We know she got married.
- To Count Otto von Droste-Schattenburg.
- Who?
- Otto the Bleeder.
Goes back to the Second Crusade.
Here's the family castle.
- Painter.
- Oh. Uh, come with me.
Sitzen machen.
Paint this crest on a car.
How long will it take?
That's too long.
Look, my Mercedes is parked downstairs.
- Excuse me.
- Miss Hazeltine.
- How do you spell your husband's name?
- P-I-F-F-L.
I thought it was von Droste-Schattenburg.
Oh, that! You mustn't believe everything Mr MacNamara tells you.
He fixed it all up so that Daddy wouldn't find out Otto's a Red.
In the beginning I didn't like
Mr MacNamara, but he's been marvy.
- That's enough.
- Did I say something wrong?
Buzz off.
This story is getting better and better.
- How much to forget everything?
- Think you can buy a German reporter?
- I never tried before.
- Maybe your journalists are for sale.
The adoption papers.
All signed and notarised.
Herr Oberleutnant.
- You know each other?
- He was my commander.
- In the subway?
- No, when I was drafted.
- Aha, Gestapo.
- No, no. SS.
Halten Sie doch den Mund, Sie Idiot.
Well, Herr Oberleutnant, is there anything else I can do for you?
No, thank you. I have all the facts.
Union between the Hazeltines and the von Droste-Schattenburgs - the social event of the year.
- It will be in today's paper.
- It better.
- Auf Wiedersehen.
- Sieg Heil.
As for you, you're back in the SS.
Smaller Salary.
Let me explain. I was only a pastry cook in the officers' mess.
I want the maître d' at the Hilton.
I was a very bad pastry cook.
11 o'clock. Where are the hats?
Where are the flowers?
- We're behind schedule.
- Yes, sir.
Manfred, I'd like to arrange a banquet.
The von Droste-Schattenburgs honouring the Wendell P Hazeltines.
You got a polka-dot dress?
Fräulein, haben Sie eine tattoo on your... Glockenspiel?
- Any broads working in this office?
- No, sir. Just me.
Look, polka dots. It fits the description.
- Whose dress is that?
- I don't know.
We'd better check it out.
Corporal, I'm relieving myself of duty.
Turn me in for psychiatric observation.
- What's the matter?
- She's in there all right.
I saw her. Naked as a jaybird.
Has she got the tattoo on her chest?
- So what's wrong, Sarge?
- Fellas, you won't believe this.
But one of them is yellow.
One of them is green.
Take me away.
For the entrée: Venison and hominy grits.
How do I know where you get grits?
Try the army PX.
For dessert: Peaches flambées à la Hazeltine.
Wine: King-size Coca-Cola in ice buckets.
On the table: The von Droste-Schattenburg coat of arms with crossed flags.
Music: "Dixie",
"Waiting For The Robert E Lee".
But not, I repeat not,
"Marching Through Georgia".
Do you really want to make me the boss?
It's a must. So your father-in-law won't think you're just a titled beatnik.
- I'm going to like this job.
- About time you cooperated.
Know what the first thing is I'll do?
- I'm going to lead the workers in revolt!
- Put your pants on, Spartacus.
Call the airport and find out if the
12 o'clock plane from London is on time.
Yes, Mr MacNamara.
Tempelhof?
Pan American Auskunft, bitte.
Soft-drinks slaves of the world, arise.
Smash those bottles, pour that syrup down the sewers.
- Remember me?
- Commissar Peripetchikoff. Well, well.
- Well is the one thing I am not.
- You are a Russian commissar?
- You have made fool of me.
- He fooled me too.
You must help me and my wife get into the Soviet Zone.
- There may be a little problem.
- Yeah, everybody's coming this way.
You want to fight all that traffic?
I'm a Party member.
Paid up till December.
They need me. I'm a missile scientist.
That is one field where we're ahead of America.
In Cape Canaveral if missile goes wrong, they press button and pow! It blows up.
- But in Russia we have two buttons.
- Two buttons!
One to blow up missile, one to blow up scientist.
- What kind of a commissar are you?
- An ex-commissar.
- You've defected?
- Is old Russian proverb.
- "Go West, young man".
- What happened to your pals?
I snitched Borodenko's secret police badge and had them both arrested.
You betrayed your own comrades?
If I don't do it to them, they do it to me.
- Is old Russian proverb.
- You're worse than he is.
Look, my young friend, what do you think Khrushchev did to Malenkov?
What do you think Stalin did to Trotsky?
- Is everybody in this world corrupt?
- I don't know everybody.
Maybe we should liquidate the human race and start all over again.
Look, kid, any world that can produce the Taj Mahal,
William Shakespeare and striped toothpaste can't be all bad.
- The trousers. Try them on.
- Take him with you.
From now on I fight alone.
Piffl against everybody and everything!
See what I'm up against?
He can't even remember his own name.
- To get back to me...
- Do you want money?
Certainly not. I will be rich man now.
Remember the Swiss cheese?
- What about it?
- I have tremendous scheme.
I will trade it for sauerkraut.
I will silver-plate the sauerkraut and sell it in the US for Christmas-tree decorations.
- You're a cinch.
- But for this I need secretary.
- And you promised me blonde lady.
- You came at the right time.
I'm moving to London anyway. But I don't know how to break the news to her.
Ingeborg.
It's not going to be easy.
She's crazy about me.
- Yes?
- A classified ad to run in all papers.
International businessman, overweight but cute, needs executive secretary.
Fringe benefits include extensive travel, wardrobe allowance, retirement plan...
- I'll take the job.
- You got it.
Goodbye, good luck.
- And what about Tempelhof?
- Oh. The plane will be ten minutes early.
That's a hell of a way to run an airline.
Planes are supposed to be late, not early.
I never want to see him again.
I never want to speak to him.
- I want a divorce.
- What's the matter now?
He doesn't want the baby. He says no one should bring children into such a world.
That miserable punk.
Why didn't he think of that before?
Where is he?
I'm sorry. I didn't mean it.
Of course we're going to have the baby.
I love you.
Don't ever scare me like that again.
Maybe our children can make this a better place to live in.
A world where men are created equal and there's liberty and justice for all.
Congratulations.
You just quoted Jefferson, Lincoln and the Pledge of Allegiance to the flag.
I what?
Come on, let's get going.
- (ripping)
- There.
- I take it into the other room and fix it.
- We haven't time. Come with us.
Schlemmer!
Sitzen machen.
- Blumen.
- Here. This is for your mother-in-law.
Die Hüte!
You in front. You, paint from the inside.
Fritz, to the airport. Eins, zwei, drei.
Aiyee!
Watch that umbrella.
- No, I don't like it.
- You need some stuff in your pockets.
Money, cigarette case, lighter, picture of the castle.
- Try this one, darling.
- You better take my wristwatch too.
- That's my wrist.
- Oh.
I don't think you were meant to wear a hat.
I wasn't meant to be a count either.
- Who's going to believe it?
- Calm down.
The only royalty we know in America is Nat King Cole and Earl Wilson.
- Ouch!
- Pardon.
Please, not that. Anything but that.
All right. Let's see if we have a black bowler.
- Here's what you owe me.
- Owe you?
All itemised. Limousine: 20,000 Marks.
Cost of adoption: 4,500 Marks.
Suits, haberdashery, shoes, etc, etc: 12,800 Marks.
Luggage, flowers, dinner: 925 Marks.
Haircut and manicure: 14 Marks.
Tip: 6 Marks. I'm a very large tipper.
Wristwatch, cigarette case, lighter: 2,200 Marks.
Loose change: 475 Marks.
Total: 41,020 Marks or $10,255.
I have been a capitalist for three hours and already I owe $10,000?
That's our system.
Everybody owes everybody.
That's the one.
Doesn't it look distinguished?
Not bad.
11.46. Faster, Fritz.
Before you meet Daddy, there are certain things he feels strongly about.
- One is the Civil War.
- Civil War?
- Just say it was a draw.
- Another's Coca-Cola.
Say we must look beyond the six-pack.
Why not a 12-pack?
- Then there's golf.
- Family that play together stay together.
- The world situation.
- Serious, but not hopeless.
- Vivisection.
- Shouldn't happen to a dog.
And Red China and income taxes and Tennessee Williams.
Wait. Stop the car.
I can't remember all that.
- You can't give up now.
- Maybe we'll get lucky.
Maybe somebody hijacked the plane.
(Tannoy) Pan American gibt die Ankunft des Clippers 306 aus London bekannt.
Melanie, let me handle this young man.
It'll take me 30 seconds to find out if he's a fortune-hunter or a crackpot.
- Oh, dear, I hope not.
- You don't know these Europeans.
My poor honey-chile.
Where are they, anyway?
Tear them again and I'll tear you apart.
- Scarlett!
- Scarlett!
Scarlett!
Scarlett!
- Mother!
- Let me look at you.
Dad!
- All right. Now where is he?
- Over here.
- Meet my husband Otto.
- The Count von Droste-Schattenburg.
- Count von what?
- My mother.
Your Highness.
Please, not in immediate family.
Gnädige Frau.
One of those hand-kissers.
- And this is my father.
- Hello, Dad.
How's your golf? A family that play...
There are a few questions
I want to ask you.
- If it's a boy, we'll name him after you.
- Wendell P von Droste-Schattenburg.
- Von Droste what?
- We'll have to be careful with the baby.
Otto comes from a long line of bleeders.
I always wanted Scarlett to be married to a long line of somethings.
MacNamara, tell me about this man.
What does he do besides slobber over women's hands?
Don't let that title fool you. He works.
- Doing what?
- He's head of our bottling plant.
- He works for us?
- Best man I ever had. Engineer.
Took a lot to get him away from our competitors.
You don't say.
- This is a picture of the family castle.
- Oh!
And this is my Party membership.
Oops - wrong Party.
- And here's the family crest.
- Oh!
You'll have to put that on your stationery and your silverware and your underwear...
Glad to have you on the team.
I suppose you met in the bottling plant.
No, we met in a parade.
He had a picture of Khrushchev.
- Khrushchev?
- Yes, with a big slogan on it.
- "Russki, go home".
- They jailed him.
- My poor boy.
- How is the situation here?
It shouldn't happen to a dog.
I mean, it's a draw.
Actually the situation is hopeless, but not serious.
Hopeless but not...
The boy's got a head on his shoulders.
- What did I tell you?
- May I have those?
- Fritz. Mit the luggage machen.
- Jawohl.
Next. Schlemmer!
- Take these to passport control.
- Yes, sir.
Next. Mom, Dad,
I'm giving a banquet tonight.
- Un petit dîner en famille.
- He speaks French too!
- And Russian.
- Russian?!
White Russian.
Now, Dad, there are a few ideas
I'd like to kick around.
We must look beyond the six-pack.
Why not a 12-pack?
(Tannoy) Pan American flight 17 to New
York via Frankfurt now boarding at gate 5.
Pan American gibt den Abflug des Clippers 17 nach New York über Frankfurt bekannt.
Bitte halten Sie lhre Bordkarten bereit und begeben Sie sich zu...
- Phyllis!
- Mac, you came through 100 per cent.
- I did what I could.
- I've found the right man for London.
- Thanks.
- It's just what we need.
Somebody who's a good organiser, has a lot of drive, speaks languages.
- Well, I studied every chance I had.
- The ideal man for this position.
And I'm not just saying that because he's my son-in-law.
- How's that?
- It won't hurt our prestige.
Head of European operations -
Count Otto von Droste-Schattenburg.
- Oh, that's how it is.
- You haven't been forgotten.
You're going all the way to the top.
There's an opening in the home office.
Vice-president for procurement. All yours.
- Why are you so good to me?
- You must be dying to get back.
Dying is right. Here you are, Count.
I won't be needing this any more.
- Thanks, old chap.
- Bye, Countess.
Mr MacNamara, I simply adore you.
- Will you write?
- Better than that.
I'll send you some silver-plated sauerkraut for Christmas.
- Can we have a Coke?
- On the plane. I don't have any change.
- I've got change.
- Mac!
Very nice of you to come down here to see me off.
- Where are you going?
- Back to the States.
- Funny. That's where we're going.
- I thought I'd take flight 17 to New York.
- From there I can hop a bus to Atlanta.
- Atlanta?!
Yeah. I'm the new vice president for bottle caps.
- They're kicking me upstairs.
- I've always wanted to do that myself.
So any time you and the kids care to join me, I'll be waiting.
Just a minute. Conference.
Two out of three. Deal is on.
Two out of three?!
All right, who's the wise guy?
Schlemmer!

Good day to you, ma'am.
Would this be the home of
Mr. Anthony J. Drexel Biddle?
It would.
I've come to be interviewed for the position of the butler.
Mrs. Biddle does the interviewin'.
She's not at home just now.
But I had an appointment.
The Mayflower Employment Agency.
I'll tell Mrs. Biddle that you were put out about it.
Oh.
Not at all.
I'd be pleased to call again.
Good day to ya.
What part of Ireland?
County Tyrone.
Just new here, are ya?
The day before yesterday.
Oh, well, perhaps you'd like to wait in the kitchen.
Mrs. Biddle will be comin' home soon.
That's very kind of you.
Thank you very much.
Faith, 'tis a grand place you have here.
I'm the housekeeper here.
Me name's Mrs. Worth.
Mine's John Lawless.
This way, John Lawless.
Have a seat, and I'll pour you some coffee.
Don't you be troubling yourself.
No trouble.
There's a pot brewing on the stove.
Sit down.
Would you be from Ireland yourself, Mrs. Worth?
I came over as young girl.
Not long ago, then.
Tell me, Mrs. Worth, what became of the last butler?
I couldn't say.
He left in the dead of night after being here less than a month.
We've got a servant problem in this house.
No use sayin' we don't.
Must be hard working for the very rich.
I mean, they're accustomed to havin' things just so.
That's not exactly the problem.
The wage is very low.
No, the Biddles are generous enough.
Long hours, then?
I wouldn't say so.
There's a gorgeous sight.
Are you getting ready for a party?
No, Mr. Biddle's on a chocolate-cake diet.
I beg your pardon?
Cordelia!
He says it's the perfect food, containing every essential element.
Where is Mrs. Biddle?
She's gone shopping.
Blast!
And Cordy?
- I couldn't say.
- And the boys?
I haven't seen them since lunch.
At a time like this.
No one!
Is there something
I could do, Mr. Biddle?
Yes.
You can call Dr. Donleavy.
Tell him I've been bit by an alligator.
Oh, dear!
Might as well live alone.
Are you a married man?
Me, sir?
No, sir.
Then you wouldn't understand.
? I've been bit on my finger?
? It could have been my leg?
? It could have been my head?
? I might have died?
? In a time of mortal peril?
? Any man should expect?
? That his family will come rushing to his side?
? What's wrong with that??
? What's wrong with that??
? My family rushing to my side?
? What's wrong with that??
Oh, not a thing, sir, I'm sure.
? I'm a good-hearted husband?
? I'm generous and kind?
? No wife could have a life as free of cares?
? So when a good-hearted husband has been bit?
? It's only right?
? That his wife should share the agony he bears?
? What's wrong with that??
? What's wrong with that??
? I want my wife to share my life?
? What's wrong with that??
Cordelia!
Well, now.
Now, that answers a whole slew of questions, don't it?
Cordy!
Boys!
Blast!
? Here in this house
I'm raising?
? Three strong, intelligent children?
? Where are they now in their father's time of need??
? I give them private tutors?
? The finest physical trainers?
? All in vain?
Ohh, the pain!
? I believe in the Bible?
? I believe in Uncle Sam?
? And as sure as Old Glory waves above?
? I believe a man who's bitten has the right to demand?
? That his family give him sympathy and love?
? What's wrong with that??
? What's wrong with that??
? The flag above, the Bible, and love?
? What's wrong with that??
- Hello, Papa.
- Cordy!
Where have you been?
Out in the stable with Tony and Liv.
- Is something wrong?
- Yes, something's wrong.
What were you doing shaving at this time of day?
I haven't been shaving.
And since when do
I shave my finger?
You don't shave your ear either.
- But last week you cut it.
- That's different.
The ear is in the general vicinity of the face.
So's the finger when you're shaving.
It's a bite, blast it!
- No.
- Yes.
- Who?
- George.
Turned on me just like that after all these years.
Well, it's really not such a bad bite.
Is that all you have to say?
There's some antiseptic in the emergency kit.
- And some bandages.
- Wait a minute.
Where are you going?
It's time for Bible class.
Yes, I know.
But you'll have to do without me today.
I have an engagement.
Dr. Donleavy's somewhere between his office and the hospital.
Keep trying.
Oh, what are you doing?
Me, sir?
Not a thing, sir.
- Well, do something.
- Yes, sir.
Blasted alligator.
- I beg your pardon.
- Treated him like a son.
What exactly would you like me to do?
Tell the boys to bring in that emergency kit.
Out the back door, across the yard to the stable.
Mr. Tony.
Mr. Livingston.
Mr. Tony and Mr. Livingston.
Blasted Benedict Arnold.
That's what he is.
Yes?
Would you tell Miss Biddle
Mr. Taylor is calling?
- Mr. Who?
- Mr. Charles Taylor.
Miss Biddle is expecting me.
Cordy!
Dr. Donleavy must have stopped to make a house call.
I could be dying.
Indeed you could.
Where's that blasted antiseptic?
Here you are, Pa.
- It's about time.
- We came as soon as we heard.
I left word with the doctor to call.
What happened, Pa?
Was it really George?
Gentle old George?
Yes, it was gentle old George.
Hey, Pa, what's
Charlie Taylor doing here?
He came to see Cordy.
The answer to a maiden's prayer.
What do you know about maidens' prayers?
Nothing, Pa.
It's just an expression.
Oh.
But Charlie Taylor?
- Cordy can do better than that.
- I'm sure she can.
When the time comes.
That's pretty good.
Going into vaudeville?
Hi, Tony.
Long time, no see.
- This is my brother, Liv.
- Hiya, sport.
Hi.
- Say, that man in the hall.
- Yeah?
That wasn't your father, was it?
- Who did you think it was?
- I thought he was some kind...
Uh, uh, uh.
Hey, caramel!
They're for Cordy, sport.
Cordy hates caramels.
They stick in her retainer.
But I like caramel.
So does Tony.
Don't you, sport?
Oh, love 'em.
Okay, fellas, that's enough.
Charlie! You've been hiding your light under a bushel.
Liv, you should feel that.
Hey! What weight do you fight at, Charlie?
- Fight?
- Boxing.
You do box, don't you?
I prefer other sports.
You don't do it at all?
No.
Liv, he doesn't do it at all.
Aw, Charlie.
You're in trouble.
I don't understand.
Well, if you've got your eye on Cordy...
? Remember Harry Applegate??
? Yeah, he took
Cordy on a date?
? Oh, what a dapper Dan?
? Pearly teeth and tennis tan?
Remember him well.
? Thought he was a Romeo?
? Tried to kiss our sis, and, oh!?
? Harry ducked, but too late?
? Father bought him an upper plate?
? Watch your footwork?
? Better learn to bob and weave?
? Sister Cordy's got dynamite up her sleeve?
? What a jab?
? Dynamite up her sleeve?
? What a hook?
? Dynamite up her sleeve?
? Keep your guard up?
Charlie, never lead it with your right.
You'll get killed that way.
Look, fellas, let's forget the whole thing.
I didn't come here to do this.
? Archie Baxter came here twice?
? First time out, he acted nice?
? Romance was in the air?
? Oh, they made a lovely pair?
Beautiful.
? Second date, it was a dance?
? He grabbed her tight, this was his chance?
? Cordy only bruised that sport?
? Father settled it out of court?
So...
? Watch your footwork?
? Better learn to bob and weave?
? Sister Cordy's got dynamite up her sleeve?
? What a fake?
? Dynamite up her sleeve?
? What an uppercut?
? Dynamite up her sleeve?
Uh-oh.
- Charlie.
- Charlie?
- Hey, Charlie, wake up.
- Are you hurt?
Tony? Livingston?
Come on, it's time for Bible class.
What happened?
He dropped his left.
Oh.
You better get some ice.
And get some beefsteak.
Charlie?
Charlie!
Well, don't you look pretty!
Papa, how could you?
How could I what?
It's no wonder
I never have any callers.
- Oh, now, wait a minute.
- People are afraid to come here.
I didn't hurt the young sap.
Sap?
Charlie Taylor's only the most popular boy in town.
Oh, here he comes.
Charlie, are you all right?
Sure, he's all right.
Come on, Charlie.
- Thataboy.
- I'm so sorry, Charlie.
There's no serious damage.
He'll have a black eye for a couple of days.
- Ooh!
- Can I get you something?
I sent for some raw meat.
How about a cold drink, Charlie?
Oh!
Oh, thank you.
Charlie, why don't you sit in this comfortable chair?
And I'll see if
I can get you some iced tea.
Or would you like a piece of chocolate cake?
Charlie!
Gee, we're sorry.
We didn't mean to do it.
We told him to keep his guard up.
You see, Cordy, I had nothing to do with it.
Didn't you?
Like father, like son.
You're all three the same.
Always having your sport no matter what.
Always ready for a fight.
Oh, Cordy, we didn't...
Don't touch me.
I'll flatten you!
Cordy.
Cordy, wait.
Blast it!
? Oh,
Miss Cordelia Drexel Biddle?
? I thought I knew you well?
? But now,
Miss Cordelia Drexel Biddle?
? I just can't tell?
? Are you valentine candy or bo xing gloves??
? Lately you seem very strange?
? What in the world's coming over you??
? Everything's starting to change?
? Are you sonnets by Shelley or Rover Boys??
? Once any answer would do?
? Why are you suddenly wondering?
? Which kind of someone are you??
? Is a boy meant to spar with or gaze at a star with??
? Should you kiss him or blacken his eye??
? Now, if he buys you roses?
? A right to the nose is really not quite the proper reply?
? You're so lost in the middle of in-between?
? Is your destiny canvas or crepe de Chine??
? Will you someday be someone that somebody loves??
? Are you valentine candy or...?
? Bo xing gloves??
Mrs. Worth,
I'm not a one to pry, but I can't help wondering some things.
Yes, Mr. Lawless?
? Board by board?
Is it forever like this?
Like what?
Ha, that must be
Dr. Donleavy at last.
? Body and mind of mortal man?
It isn't as if this was the only job in Philadelphia.
Well, not for a likable lad like meself.
? Fashion the framework board by board?
Mrs. Worth?
I've decided to run along for now.
Perhaps I can call another day.
Perhaps.
Who are you?
John Lawless.
A professional pugilist, no doubt.
Ma'am?
Did you come here to fight?
Oh, no, ma'am, I came about the butler's position.
Then announce me.
And take off your hat in the house.
? Strengthen the dwelling of the Lord?
? Fashion the framework board by board?
? Here in his image now we stand?
? Building his fortress strong and grand?
? It is written that the?
? Body and mind of mortal man?
? Should walk in the spirit of his master plan?
Mr. Biddle?
There's a lady in the music room.
A lady?
She didn't give a name.
Like there was no need.
Aunt Mary.
Tell her there's nobody at home.
But, sir...
? It is written that the?
? Body and mind of mortal man?
? Should walk in the spirit of his master plan?
? So we must strengthen the dwelling of the Lord?
I'm afraid there's no one here, ma'am.
No one here?
No one at all save
Mrs. Worth and meself.
And as for me, I...
? It is written that the body and mind of mortal man?
? Should walk in the spirit of his master plan?
Aunt Mary!
What a nice surprise.
Is it?
I come about the butler's position.
Oh, good!
Then take these, would you?
And tell Mr. Biddle that Aunt Mary is here.
And bring us some tea into the parlor, please.
If the stores get any more crowded,
I'm just going to have to give up shopping entirely.
You can't imagine the swarms of people.
Do sit down, Aunt Mary.
This is not a social call.
I've come for a specific reason.
In today's paper, in George Gray's gossip column, it is reported... that "last week,
Cordelia Drexel Biddle entered a one-step contest in Atlantic City with a Heinie Fenstermaker," whoever that is.
I don't recognize the name.
"And won."
We, uh...
We were in Atlantic City for the Bible-class convention.
I know why you were in Atlantic City, but that does not explain and certainly doesn't excuse the matter at hand.
Well, good afternoon, Aunt Mary.
Always a pleasure to see you.
Cordelia.
Anthony.
Oh, Anthony, your finger.
Yes.
George bit me.
George?
I can't imagine what got into him.
Quite obviously your finger got into him.
Anyone who keeps an alligator in the house must expect to be bit and deserves it.
Well, I'm sure George was only playing and forgot himself.
Do you really think so?
Oh, I'm sure of it.
Over there, please.
He probably feels as badly about it as you do.
I wonder.
That will be all, thank you.
You're right, Cordelia.
He wants to make up.
- Well...
- Ha.
If the jungle theatrics are quite over,
I should like to return to the subject of my visit, which is Cordy.
What about Cordy?
I do not consider she's under the right influences for a young woman in her social position.
She's under my influence and her mother's and her brothers'.
Oh, please, Anthony, don't pretend naiveté.
You know perfectly well what I mean.
No, I don't.
I do not know what you mean.
Did you read this morning's paper?
Yes.
Yes, I did.
German U-boats in our waters sinking British merchant ships in sight of Nantucket.
That's what they think of our neutrality.
Did you get beyond the first page?
George Gray's column, dear.
Cream or lemon, Aunt Mary?
Of course not.
Blasted professional troublemaker.
Oh, no, he doesn't make trouble.
He reports it.
This Mr. Fenstermaker.
He's a member of one of your Bible classes, I assume?
Yes.
Yes, he is.
And a fine, upstanding young man he is, too.
Anthony, tell me something.
Were the children in school at all last year?
They were being tutored,
Aunt Mary.
And who's tutoring the tutor?
What do you mean?
Well, everybody knows that you hired this man as a boxing coach.
Can't even sign his own name.
Tony and Liv got into St. Paul's all right.
They're going next week.
And I applaud the move.
Now let's do the same for Cordy.
The Laleta Wingfield School for Young Ladies in Lakewood, New Jersey, is accepting applications.
Oh, no, you don't.
I won't have Cordy exiled to some prison.
Anthony, answer me.
What proper young man in his right mind would want to marry a lady prizefighter?
Blast the proper young man.
That's easy to say.
Besides, what's this talk about marriage?
Cordy's a child.
You're blind, Anthony, in more ways than one.
- Blind or not, I'm not...
- Papa.
Oh, Cordy.
- We were just discussing you.
- Yes, I know.
And, Papa, I'd like to go off to school.
Hello, Aunt Mary.
Good afternoon, Cordelia.
Hello, Mama.
Darling.
Cordy.
Did I hear you correctly?
I'm sure you did, Papa.
Are you still upset about what happened a while ago?
Do you want that boy back over here?
I'll drag him back.
No, Papa.
It isn't Charlie Taylor.
Well, then, what is it?
Don't you like it here?
Of course I like it here.
Don't we have a good time?
Yes.
But it's hard to explain, Papa.
I'm not like the other girls.
Well, hooray for that.
Look at the other girls.
Oh, Papa.
Cordy,
I like you the way you are.
You're pretty.
You have fun.
You're alive.
You've got a better left hook than Tony or Liv.
But I don't want a left hook.
Anthony, I think we'd better talk about this later.
She doesn't know what she's saying.
I do know what I'm saying.
I want to go to
Miss Wingfield's school.
All right.
All right.
You go.
Go to prison if you want to.
Thank you, Papa.
Blast!
Ooh!
Well, it's late.
And I've other things to do.
Well, thank you for coming, Aunt Mary.
I don't like to interfere.
But attention must be paid to these matters.
I know.
Good day, Cordelia.
Good day, Anthony.
Anthony.
We do have to let Cordy go.
She's not a child anymore.
And it's selfish to keep her here in this special world.
What's wrong with this special world?
Oh, Anthony, why do you have to take everything so personally?
Is there some other way?
You might as well put out that terrible weed.
You won't get rid of me that way.
Anthony.
I raised very few objections to the way that Cordy's been brought up, despite its being rather unorthodox.
Don't say, "What's wrong with being unorthodox?"
There's nothing wrong with it.
If I didn't feel that way,
I couldn't have stayed married to you all these years.
It's been a good life.
A healthy life.
And Cordy's been happy.
But now she's older and feels a need to reach out.
But she won't like it.
That's for her to decide.
You didn't want to let go of Tony and Liv.
You fought St. Paul's like a tiger.
Well, now it's Cordy.
Blast it, Cordelia.
I said she could go, didn't I?
Yes, dear.
Well, then... what's all the fuss about?
I'm going out to the gym.
Good idea.
You'll feel much better when you get back.
Oh.
Mrs. Biddle.
Mrs. Biddle, if it's convenient...
Oh, yes. I'm afraid
I don't remember your name.
John Lawless, ma'am.
The Mayflower Employment Agency.
Ah, fine.
Dinner's at 7:00, John.
Well?
Were you put on?
"Dinner's at 7:00," she says.
Heaven help me.
Good way to let off steam.
Papa, I'm sorry for the way I acted.
I appreciate your apology.
I do love my home.
I don't really want to go away.
Well, you were right wanting to go.
You're not a child any longer.
It's selfish to try to keep you here in this special world.
What's wrong with this special world?
Now, don't you start that.
Cordy.
You have to make your own life in your own way.
You can't stay here with your mother and me forever.
Of course, when you come home on vacations, things will be just the same.
All of a sudden, I'm afraid.
Now, that I won't have.
There's nothing out there to be afraid of, as long as you keep your guard up and your chin tucked, and know how to bring one up from the floor.
Oh, Papa.
When I was a little girl,
I used to think you must be the most wonderful person in the whole world.
Now that I'm older and much wiser, I know you are.
Well, come on, let's go back in the house.
If you don't like that school, you don't have to stay up there.
? Dee-a da da da?
? Dee-a ta ta ta-ta ta?
? Da-da ta-ta tee?
Mr. Biddle?
Mr. Bid...
What's wrong?
You're white as a sheet.
Faith, you do have an alligator!
12 of them.
What's wrong with that?
Not a thing.
It's relieved, I am.
I captured them myself down in Florida.
Went into the swamp with a party of Seminoles.
Have you ever seen a Seminole
Indian capture alligators?
I can't say I have.
Well, they can paddle a canoe so you can't hear it two feet away.
If the animals don't show themselves, you give them the mating call.
Say, who are you, anyway?
John Lawless, sir.
I'll be the new butler.
Oh, we've got a new butler.
No, Papa.
He quit.
Already?
- Days ago.
- Oh.
Well, if you'll excuse me, sir.
John Lawless, is it?
That's right, sir.
Tell me, John.
Are you a religious man?
I try to live by the Good Book.
How well do you succeed?
- I'm not sure.
- Never mind.
We'll go into that another time.
What do you think of boxing?
- Boxing?
- Why don't we find Mother...
Not in self-defense.
Ever done any of that?
Well, at the fair last year in County Tyrone,
I was fisticuffs champion.
Is that so?
Champion?
Well, it isn't a very large county, sir.
Fisticuffs champion of where was that again?
County Tyrone.
It's in Ireland.
Ah. You going to become an American citizen, John?
- Well, I intend to apply, sir.
- You'll never regret it.
- Greatest country in the world.
- Papa!
There's certain things
I believe in, John.
God and the United States are at the top of the list.
I know very well what the United States has to offer.
That's how it is I'm here.
Yes, well, like I say...
There's something else
I know just as well.
And that is you are what you are, and that's good, too.
I beg your pardon?
Well, being an American is addin' something.
It isn't subtracting.
On the night before I sailed away, they come from far and near.
? All me friends and all me kin?
? To shed a partin' tear?
? We knew we'd never meet again?
? And yet was clear to see?
? I'd always be a part of them?
? And them a part of me?
? I'll always be Irish?
? 'Cause that's how I began?
? I'll always be Irish,
I'll say that to any man?
? And when I'm an American,
I'll be a good one, too?
? I'll be truly as American as Irish stew?
Hey, that's pretty good.
? He'll be truly as American as Irish stew?
Ask for Irish stew in Ireland and see what you get.
I never thought of that.
In Ireland, all the stew is Irish.
? I'll always be Irish?
? A fact I'll not deny?
? I'll always be Irish, and I'll hold me head up high?
? I'll wear the green
St. Patty's Day?
? And yet for all of that?
? I'll be truly as American as "Casey at the Bat"?
? He'll be truly as American as "Casey at the Bat"?
Say, that looks like good exercise.
Come on, Cordy.
- Hey!
- Papa!
If you can win a one-step contest, you ought to be able to do this.
I thought you didn't like dancing.
It's that waltzing business
I don't like.
Ha.
That's for old folks.
Hey!
Huh! Ha!
? If I went to Paris for the rest of me days?
? And ate bread and cheese in sidewalk cafés?
? Lived in a garret, wore a beret?
-? What would I be??
- An Irishman!
? If I went to Tibet and bought me a yak?
? And traveled Siberia ridin' his back?
? The peasants would point at me, what would they say??
Irishman?
- Right!
- Right!
? But if I went to Spain and grew a moustache?
? Strummed the guitar and wore me a sash?
? Became a toreador and fought me a bull?
- ndele!
- Ndele!
- Hooray!
- Yippee!
After they awarded me both ears and the tail, what would they say?
- Olé!
- Olé!
- For the Irishman!
- Right!
Hey-ho!
Whoo-aaa-hoo!
Come on, Mrs. Worth.
Come on, now.
Whoo! Ha!
It's good for you.
Ha ha!
Ah, thatagirl!
You should have seen me father doin' this.
Like a tornado across the floor.
Hey!
Oh!
Ohhhh!
Ohh! Oh!
? He'll always be Irish?
Ah, shout it good and loud!
? He'll always be Irish?
? Of his heritage, he's proud?
? I'm proud of Irish blarney?
? And Irish sentiment?
? And I'll bet someday we get an Irish president?
? And I'll bet someday we get an Irish president?
Whee-ha!
Hey, let me in there.
Hey-ya diddle!
Hey-ya!
Ha!
Beautiful!
Whee!
Whee! Hoo!
- Ha!
- Whoo!
Hey!
Whoo!
Whoo-hoo!
Whoo!
Oh, the Mayflower
Employment Agency.
Oh, yes.
Yes, of course.
Hey!
Yes.
I think Mr. Lawless will suit our needs very well.
Hee!
Come on,
I want George to see this.
Whoo!
Whoo! Whoo!
Cordelia, whatever are you laughing at?
Papa.
He's now giving military training to the Bible classes.
They're marching up and down in front of the house.
Broomsticks for rifles.
Cordelia, what an absolutely gorgeous invitation!
Whoever is it from?
Well, read it for yourself if you're so anxious.
I'm not the least bit anxious.
I was only trying to be sociable.
Cordelia!
The William Thaws are absolutely world-famous for their parties.
However did you get this invitation?
Well, I'm in great demand socially.
Didn't you know?
I suppose you give boxing exhibitions.
However did you guess?
And I think I'll get in some practice.
Right now!
I'll call Miss Wingfield!
With that rouge all over your face?
Cordy.
You wouldn't tell Miss Wingfield that I wear rouge to bed, will you?
No matter how angry you get?
Well...
Oh, no, you wouldn't be so cruel.
Rosemary?
Hmm?
Would you teach me how to flirt?
Pardon?
Well, my Aunt Gladys said there were gonna be all sorts of young men at the dance from Yale and Princeton.
Your Aunt Gladys.
So that's how you got invited.
The William Thaws are my aunt and uncle.
Since I'm going to school here in Lakewood, they're practically duty-bound.
I should have guessed.
Well, it helps to be related to almost everybody.
I want to make the most of it.
Will you help me, Rosemary?
Cordelia, if you're suggesting that I know anything about...
Oh, come on, Rosemary.
I'll bet you're the world's champion.
Well, the fact that
I have been admired by men doesn't make me a flirt.
Rosemary.
Hmm?
Would you like me to swear that I'll never tell
Miss Wingfield about the rouge?
That's blackmail.
It's a trade.
Well?
I wonder if those Thaw parties are as absolutely spectacular as people say.
That's how trading works, isn't it?
All right.
I'll ask my Aunt Gladys.
Oh, good!
Come here.
Now, if a girl wants to be popular nowadays, there's one thing that she absolutely needs to know.
What?
Bye-yum pum pum.
Bye-yum pum pum?
? Bye-yum pum pum?
? Bye-yum pum pum?
? Bye-yum pum pum, bye-yum?
? You must be?
? Oh, so misterioso?
? Enthusiasm is très passé?
? You must slink across the floor?
? As if it's a dreadful bore?
? To the rhythm of bye-yum pum pum?
? Bye-yum pum pum?
? Bye-yum pum pum, bye-yum?
? Nita Naldi, Theda Bara?
? Hollow cheeks and black mascara?
? Bye-yum pum pum, bye-yum?
Okay, what's next?
? The men in college?
? Always acknowledge?
? A girl who dances in a trance?
? So bye-yum until the dawn as if you're about to yawn?
? To the rhythm of?
? Bye-yum pum pum?
? Bye-yum pum pum?
Attitude, Cordy!
? Bye-yum pum pum, bye-yum?
? Today the key to being wanted?
? Is just to glide as if you're hunted?
? And your right foot, left foot, right, back?
Let me try, let me try!
Right foot, left foot, right, back together.
Now arms, Cordy, arms.
Use your arms, back together.
And slink, two, three.
Bye-yum and slink, two, three.
Bye-yum and slink, two.
Now spin like a top.
That's it!
Cordy, you're absolutely wicked.
I love it.
How exotic.
Bravo.
Nita Naldi!
Theda Bara!
Cordy, you're absolutely dangerous.
And scandalous!
? For when you're oh, so misterioso?
? The men will grow so entranced with you?
Shocking!
? As you secretly conceal the tingly way you feel?
? When you're dancing to?
? Bye-yum pum pum?
? Bye-yum pum pum?
? Bye-yum pum pum, bye-yum?
Cordelia!
Oh!
Aunt Gladys.
Cordelia, darling.
Aunt Gladys.
I've been looking all over for you.
Where have you been?
I want you to meet the two most charming young men at the party.
My niece,
Cordelia Drexel Biddle.
Mr. Roger Fitzsimmons and Mr. Walter Blakely.
Both just down from New Haven.
- How do you do?
- A pleasure.
Well, I'll leave you three to get acquainted.
Young people today don't need anything more than an introduction.
Snappy party.
What?
Oh.
Oh, yes.
Very snappy.
Have a gasper?
A what?
Oh.
No, thank you.
I didn't think you were the type.
These days, you can't tell.
Smoking shortens your wind.
Well, that's why athletes never smoke.
Say, there's a friend of my family
I ought to go over and speak to.
Can't it wait until later, Roger?
I wouldn't want to miss her.
My mother would never forgive me.
Miss Biddle.
Yoo-hoo.
Cordelia.
Absolutely heavenly party.
Yes. Heavenly.
So many attractive men.
Who is that?
My roommate.
We're playing Harvard next week.
Who is?
Yale.
Oh.
Mr. Blakely.
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
I promised this dance.
You did?
Yes.
The first one-step.
I hope you don't mind.
Oh, no.
No, of course not.
Why don't you ask Rosemary?
- Oh, no, I couldn't.
- Tell her I suggested it.
Well, when your partner comes.
Oh, but you needn't wait around.
He'll be here any second.
Who is he?
I can keep an eye out for him.
Oh, I don't think you know him.
What's his name?
His name?
Well, it's...
Angier Duke.
This is our dance, isn't it?
The first one-step?
Yes.
Mr. Duke, Mr. Blakely.
You can't keep her to yourself all evening, Mr. Blakely.
No, I guess not.
Miss Biddle.
He's probably a nice enough fellow when you get to know him.
Shall we have our dance?
Mr. Duke, why did you do that?
Because I thought
I'd like to know you.
Worked out real well, didn't it?
Why do you want to know me?
Because you're not like the other girls.
I mean that in the nicest way.
I don't like these pushy girls who think they can trap any man with a big act.
But you saw me practicing.
Didn't it scare you away?
No.
You were so bad at it.
Oh.
It's a waltz.
The waltz is for old people.
Is it?
I warned you.
I'm not a very good dancer.
Oh, nonsense, Mr. Blakely.
You're as light as an elf.
I don't think the waltz is for old people.
I was just saying something somebody told me.
? Are we dancing??
? Are we really here??
? Is this feeling something real?
? Or will it disappear??
? Are we dancing??
? Does the music soar??
? Was this lovely song I hear?
? Ever heard before??
? Are your eyes confessing things?
? I alone can see?
? Or is my imagination?
? Flying away with me??
? Are we dancing??
? Say we really are?
? Then I'll know that I?
? Reached into the sky?
? I reached into the sky?
? And touched a star?
? Is this feeling something real?
? Or will it disappear??
? Was this lovely song I hear?
? Ever heard before??
? Are your eyes confessing things?
? I alone can see?
? Or is my imagination?
? Flying away with me??
? Are we dancing??
? Say we really are?
? Then I'll know that I?
? I'll know that I?
? Reached into the sky?
? Reached to the sky?
? I reached into the sky?
? And touched a star?
It's beautiful, isn't it?
It's more than beautiful.
It's a masterpiece of engineering.
A Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost.
Oh.
Yes, it's very nice.
You know, the chassis of that car is bolted together with special tapered bolts made to fit holes that were reamed by hand.
- Really?
- Yeah.
It's practically sewn together.
Well, I don't know very much about cars.
You don't have to know much to appreciate a Rolls.
If you were just once out on the road in that car.
Say, it's cold out here, isn't it?
Can I get your coat?
My Uncle has a Silver Ghost.
I've driven it.
I've been up to 75 miles an hour.
Smooth as silk.
The suspension system really is remarkable.
May I see you again?
Now you have to.
Pardon me, Cordelia.
My friends,
I'd like to offer a toast.
To our guests of honor.
And to the entire Marine Corps.
The most glorious institution
God ever put on this broad, green Earth.
I recently traveled to Washington to see if anyone there was concerned about this war that's got half the world in flames.
I was treated to a lot of excuses and a lot of speeches.
Until I got to the Marines.
It's going to be a long evening.
When I talked to the Marine commandant about preparedness, he understood.
When I told him there were
5,000 men here in Philadelphia ready and eager to be trained, he was interested.
These three men arrived this morning as proof of his sincerity.
They're going to work with our Philadelphia Corps.
And if war comes, by George, we're going to be ready.
? I believe in this country?
? But our country's unprepared?
? Our defenses aren't worth a hill of beans?
? So when a man loves his country?
? Should he sit back and complain?
? Or call out the United States Marines??
? What's wrong with that??
? What's wrong with that??
? What better way, what better means?
? To take my stand with the Marines??
? What's wrong with that??
To the Marine Corps.
Gentlemen, I want to say again, it's good to have you with us.
Sir, is the Philadelphia Corps the same thing as the Biddle Bible classes?
Well, it grew out of that.
The Bible classes are the hard core.
The core of the Corps.
Yes, you might say that.
Mr. Biddle, you've done a swell job getting all those men together.
I think it's great.
A man like yourself taking such an interest.
A man like myself?
Yes, an older man with plenty of money.
And I promise you, sir, we'll have them snapping to in no time.
Lieutenant, I already have them snapping to.
I expect you to take it from there.
- Will you take seconds?
- No, thank you.
The one thing my men need is formal combat training.
I'm depending on you gentlemen for that.
John, would you please tell Mrs. Worth that I'd like to serve dinner as soon as possible?
Yes, ma'am.
It's trench fighting that's going to win this war.
I want my men to learn how to use a bayonet and the butt of a gun.
We've got a training program set up.
Close combat is a part of it.
A big part, I hope.
It'll save lives.
I know I'm anxious to learn.
It's pretty strenuous exercise,
Mr. Biddle.
Is it, now?
Of course you'll be welcome to observe, sir.
Gentlemen, may I show you around the place?
We'll start with the stables.
This way, gentlemen.
The stables are right out here across the terrace.
Dear, let's not move the entire party outside.
It looks as if Anthony might learn a lesson tonight.
I'm tempted to go out there and watch myself.
Aunt Mary.
You forget that Anthony's boxed with champions.
But they were friends, Cordelia.
And professionals.
These young men are not friends.
And there is nothing so dangerous as the inspired amateur.
Yes, I fixed this place up to provide some healthy fun and relaxation for myself and the rest of the family.
Say, would any of you like to go a round or two before dinner?
How about you Marines?
Do any of you know how to box?
We all know how to box, sir.
- That's part of our training.
- Fine.
John!
You want to box with me, sir?
We'll just go a couple of rounds, Lieutenant.
Thank you.
You know, a lot of older men take up sports of one kind or another just to pass the time.
John!
You yelled, sir?
Yes. Would you keep time for us, John?
Yes, sir.
We box by college rules here,
Lieutenant.
Two-minute rounds.
Thank you, John.
Well, are you ready, Lieutenant?
Yes, sir.
All right, John.
Time, gentlemen.
The men in the Philadelphia
Corps have a lot to learn about military science.
But you will find them well-disciplined.
And physically fit.
So that's your style, is it?
Bill O'Brien used to lean on his left like that.
Poor Billy never was a really top fighter.
One thing to remember about the Philadelphia Corps.
They're civilians.
You'll get a lot more out of them if you lead them.
Rather than bully them.
Know what I mean?
Oh, Lieutenant!
Well, that was just a lucky punch.
Might just as well have happened to me.
Come on.
Yeah, that was quick thinking catching old Jim Corbett in your lap like that.
John, that's a bad spot for old Jim up there.
I'll bet we've knocked him off that wall at least a dozen times.
You know, Corbett and I sparred in this very ring several times.
He was a great fighter.
Well, who's next?
Well, don't you think we ought to go back, sir?
We wouldn't want to delay dinner, sir.
That's very considerate.
We'll rejoin the ladies, then.
John, would you get some ice for the lieutenant?
- It'll keep the swelling down.
- I'll bring some directly, sir.
As soon as I get Mr. Corbett back up on the wall.
You know, I've worked up a little appetite.
Yes, boxing always helps my appetite.
Greatest sport in the world.
Mr. Biddle?
I've got a proposition.
If you won't tell the men of the Philadelphia Corps that you took the best boxer among us in one round, we'll teach you all the close combat you want, sir.
Fine, fine.
I'm looking forward to it.
Say, gentlemen, before we go in to dinner,
I want to show you my alligators.
? What's wrong with that??
? What's wrong with that??
? What better way, what better means?
? To take your stand with the Marines??
? What's wrong with that??
? What's wrong with that??
Come on.
I'll show you the alligators.
I keep them in the conservatory.
The days of the custom car are numbered.
Even in luxury automobiles, standardization is a practical necessity.
Not only for the manufacturer but for the individual car owner as well.
Take a car like the Marmon.
I'd rather not.
Huh?
Angie, do you think we could talk about something besides automobiles for a change?
World affairs.
Or the weather.
I'm sorry, Cordy.
Or you.
I'd really love to hear about you.
Okay. Me.
What kind of music do you like?
Music?
What's your favorite book?
Let me see.
My favorite book.
Let's talk about your career.
My career?
There's not much to tell.
We're in tobacco.
Do you like tobacco?
As a business, I mean.
I guess so.
You guess so?
I haven't thought that much about it.
It's a family business, and I guess I'll take it over someday.
Is there something you'd rather do?
Yes, but you said you wanted to talk about something else.
Oh, no.
You mean you want to make a career out of automobiles?
? There's a shining city west of here?
? Where dreams are booming into gear?
? It's no humdrum nine-to-five town?
? It's a growing, going, bright, alive town?
? Golden sparks light up the skies there?
? Like a thousand
Fourth of Julys there?
? How I want to stake a claim in?
? Roll up my sleeves and make a name in?
? Detroit?
Detroit?
Michigan.
? You can hear it humming, see it coming?
? Feel it everywhere you go?
? It's tomorrow morning?
? The future dawning?
? With a bright and shining glow?
? It's a land where golden chariots?
? Are molded out of dreams?
? Detroit?
? Detroit?
? Detroit, Detroit?
? It's Detroit?
? Oh, if I could be there,
I'd be free there?
? Standing on my own two feet?
? I'd invent new motors, design new rotors?
? I'd be in the driver's seat?
? I'd make all my dreams realities?
? Oh, I'd be on my way?
? In Detroit?
? Detroit?
? Detroit, Detroit?
? In Detroit?
? Others are giving their dreams a try?
? If others can dream there?
? Why can't I??
Cordy, you'd be amazed at the things they're doing out there.
They're working on a two-range transmission.
Four-wheel brakes.
Do you think they could do something about the seats?
Sure.
That's easy.
And heat the inside?
Why not? There's hot water in the radiator.
How about a gramophone so we could have music on long trips?
Sure.
It's possible.
And any color you want?
I don't know about that.
Okay.
Any color you want.
? So you see where the rainbow ends for me?
? Is known to the world as F. O.B.?
? Detroit?
What is it?
I don't know.
I'll find out.
Cordy.
You think I'm crazy?
About Detroit, I mean.
Boy, my mother does.
? If you hear it humming, see it coming?
? That's the place where you must go?
? But to make your name there?
? You must stake your claim there?
? And let no one tell you no?
Then you don't think I'm crazy.
? Then my dreams of golden chariots?
? In Detroit can all come true?
? For you hear it humming?
? And you see it coming?
? And you?
? Want to be there, too?
Hurry!
Well, those men looked good tonight.
Yes, sir.
Like seasoned troopers.
Don't you think they looked good?
Yes, dear.
They looked cold, too.
I was sorry for them.
They're going to have to fight battles in cold weather.
I wasn't criticizing, dear.
It was a lovely parade.
- It's cold in here.
- Yes, it is.
Yeah, I think the furnace must be off.
No.
The radiator's hot.
Yeah, there's a terrible draft coming from somewhere.
The conservatory, I think.
The conservatory?
John!
My alligators.
Look at my alligators.
John!
George.
John!
Yes, sir?
You yelled, sir?
What's happened here?
Why are these windows open?
It must have been the new maid, sir.
What new maid?
Her name is Florence, dear.
She started this afternoon.
She was complaining about the smell.
- What smell?
- The alligators.
- They do have a certain...
- What?
We're accustomed to it, dear.
Oh.
She probably decided to give the room an airing... and forgot to close up again.
Well, of all the blasted, stupid...
Get an ax.
Anthony!
Not for Florence.
For the alligators.
Maybe they're still alive.
We'll chop 'em out.
An ax! Move!
Dead, dead, dead.
Get some more towels, John.
Yes, ma'am.
Anthony, it's after midnight.
Yeah.
I hate to give up.
I know, dear.
But there comes a time.
I'll get it.
Dead, dead, dead.
Hello?
Yes, this is Mr. Biddle.
Who's calling?
Oh, yes.
How long ago?
What have you done about it?
Have you called the police?
- Then call them, blast it!
- What is it, Anthony?
I want that blasted town turned upside down, do you hear?
All right.
Call me back the minute you know anything.
- Is it Cordy?
- Yes.
- She's missing.
- Missing?
Three hours past curfew, and nobody there has any idea where she is.
That's a fine way to run a prison.
You don't suppose she's been kidnapped?
- For heaven's sake.
- Well, it happens.
Operator!
- Don't do anything foolish.
- Foolish?
Our daughter is heaven knows where.
- Operator!
- Hello.
Cordy.
Mother.
Cordy.
Papa.
Are you all right?
Of course I'm all right.
You're not hurt in any way?
What are you talking about?
We just had a call from Miss Wingfield.
Oh.
I was hoping we'd get here before that happened.
The weather held us up.
Us?
Is someone with you, Cordy?
Yes.
My fiancé.
Your...
Your what?
His name is Angier Buchanan Duke.
He's in the car.
Do you mean to tell me that some boy is sitting in front of this house thinking he's going to marry you?
Anthony, please.
He wanted to make sure
I got in all right.
I'll tell him he can go now.
Good night!
Good night?
Aren't you going to ask him in?
No, Mother, I don't think so.
I'll call you in the morning!
We don't even get a chance to see him?
Of course you'll see him.
When you're ready.
I'm ready now.
No, Papa.
I'm not gonna let you at him.
Not until you get used to the idea.
Where did you meet this young man, Cordy?
At a party Aunt Gladys and Uncle Bill gave.
I wrote you about it.
You didn't write us about getting engaged.
He didn't ask me until today.
What took him so long?
Oh, now, Anthony.
Papa.
I think you'll really like him very much if you just give him a chance.
Of course we'll give him a chance.
Is I dreaming, I am?
Hello, John.
Oh, you look fine.
Because I'm happy.
I'm engaged!
Engaged, is it?
Well, isn't that grand?
I'm very happy for you.
Isn't that wonderful news,
Mrs. Biddle?
Isn't it just...
I'd best be getting these towels into the parlor.
Towels?
We had a sort of accident this evening.
But I think we should all go up to bed now and talk in the morning.
I am tired.
We got stuck in the snow twice.
And we thought we'd broken the axle.
And then the fan belt came off.
But it was fun.
Good night, Mother.
Good night, darling.
It's so nice to be home.
I love you, Papa.
Good night.
Good night.
"My fiancé," she says.
Without batting an eye.
And you just stand there.
And I just stand there.
What else could we do?
We've never met the young man.
We don't know anything about him.
What's that got to do with it?
She's a child.
She's a young woman.
You can't hold back the clocks, Anthony.
Cordelia, I don't know what you're talking about.
I'm not trying to hold back any clocks.
She's not ready for marriage.
You're not ready.
I'm not going to sit still for it.
Anthony, you'll be making the greatest mistake of your life if you try to stop this engagement.
Is it wrong for me to try to protect my daughter?
Cordy has a mind of her own.
Faced with an obstacle, she will proceed with still greater determination.
Why, you, of all people, ought to know that.
We don't want to push her into an elopement.
Come on.
You know, I'm anxious to see what he looks like.
I believe you're enjoying this.
Well, in a way, I am.
It's a very exciting time.
Cordelia, sometimes you amaze me.
Well, I hope so, Anthony.
It never rains but it pours.
To lose your only daughter and your pet alligators all on the same black night.
What's all the...
Oh!
Anthony, what are you doing down there?
The girl's crazy.
That stuff she uses to color her hair must have gone to her brain.
Miss, would you mind telling me what...
What's going on?
Well...
Well, I'll be.
Anthony, what is it?
Everything's all right now.
That nitwit girl frighten you?
They're not dead!
John!
John!
Yes, sir?
John, they're not dead!
Yes, sir.
I know, sir.
Come on, George.
George!
Cordelia, it's George.
What is it, Papa?
They're not dead.
George.
George, come back here.
Allow me, sir.
George!
George, not outside.
You'll freeze all over again.
Here you are, Mother.
All right.
Out of there.
Run along now.
In the conservatory.
Ah-ah.
Thank you.
Come on.
You heard what Mother said.
Into the conservatory.
George?
Did George come back in here again?
I didn't see him, dear.
Take a look in the dining room, John.
Where do you suppose he got to?
There's breakfast to get on the table, in case you forgot.
How can you be so calm with those monsters on the loose?
They know better than to get in my way.
You can fill the cream pitcher and get busy settin' the table.
Idiot girl.
None of them stay very long.
I'll teach you to make yourself at home in my kitchen!
Come out, I say!
Me new broom.
You drop that!
Drop it, I say!
Where you going, you beast?
You'd be a handbag if I had my way.
You should've let out a call.
I'd have given you a hand.
Thank you, Mr. Lawless.
It wasn't necessary.
I managed very well on me own.
Breakfast will be in half an hour.
I have to slice some more bacon.
Thank you, Mrs. Worth.
Well, I think we'd better get dressed.
That girl may come back here with the police.
Cordy.
Yes, Papa?
Cordy, I've been thinking things over.
I realize
I acted badly last night.
I want you to invite your young man to dinner so I can, as you say, give him a chance.
Thank you, Papa.
Well, you know, I worked up quite an appetite.
I think I'd rather have scrapple than bacon.
Mrs. Worth.
Thank you, Mother.
What for, darling?
For helping Papa change his mind.
Did I do that?
Are you sure?
Oh!
There's an old Irish proverb.
To have your alligators thawed out and your daughter forgive you all on the same bright day, that's fortuosity.
- John?
- Sir?
Who are you talking to?
No one, sir.
You know what they say about people who talk to themselves.
It's like I said.
It's another case of...
? Fortuosity?
? That's me byword?
? Fortuosity means?
George?
George?
? Round the corner?
Ha ha!
George?
George?
I've had about as much as I can stand, now, George!
George!
In the tank.
Will you get in the tank when I tell you?
Right.
George!
George.
Will you come back here?
Come on.
Oh, did I frighten you, then?
Hey, George.
George!
Not in the music room.
Get in...
George.
Come on, George.
Up.
Hey!
That's a good lad.
There you go.
Come on, boy.
This way, lad.
That's a good lad.
There you go.
It's like I said.
? Every bit of life is lit by fortuosity?
? And that's me byword?
? Every bit of life is lit by?
? Twinkle-in-the-eye word?
? Every bit of life is lit?
? By fortuosity?
Aah!
John!
Coming, sir.
George.
Yes, it can only be a matter of weeks now.
Even the White House admits we can't stay out of this war.
I tried to enlist.
Do you know what they told me?
"You're too old."
Me, in the prime of life.
Fit as a fiddle.
"Too old."
No more wine, Mr. Duke?
No thank you, Mr. Biddle.
I still have a full glass.
Don't you like the wine?
We have others.
A cellarful.
No, thank you. No.
I don't drink very much.
It goes right to my head.
That's where it's supposed to go.
So you live in New York,
Mr. Duke.
Yes, ma'am. I do.
Do you like it?
Well, yes.
I guess so.
I never could stand the place, myself.
- How about your work?
- Sir?
Do you enjoy working?
Well, no.
Not really.
- To tell you the truth...
- I don't blame you.
Offices are deadly places.
They confine a man.
Spiritually and physically.
What do you do to escape?
Escape, sir?
Yes.
Do you go in for sports?
Well, I have a boat.
A boat?
A yacht, Papa.
Oh.
A yacht.
Well, I suppose a man can get a kick out of a yacht.
Do you?
Do I what, sir?
Get a kick out of your blasted yacht.
Well, I haven't been on it for a while.
I suppose you've been busy getting ready for the war.
Angie's gonna turn his boat over, Papa.
Turn it over.
Well, that's a good thing to do with a boat.
To the Coast Guard, Papa.
Oh.
Mother thought it would be a good idea.
I see.
Tell me, Mr. Duke.
What else do you like?
Besides sailing, I mean.
Hiking? Skiing?
I broke an ankle once skiing.
Did you get back up on those skis and try again?
No, sir.
Well, you should have.
Well, the bone was kind of sticking out.
Oh.
Oh, that's right.
It goes to your head.
Do you do any fishing or hunting?
Or do you box?
No, sir.
I just don't seem to have the time.
You should take the time.
I was a sickly child, Mr. Duke.
Asthma.
Then when I was 10,
I came down with typhoid fever.
"That's it," they said.
"He'll never make it."
But I did make it.
And somehow the fever killed the asthma.
It was like a miracle.
And do you know what I learned at that early age, Mr. Duke?
That life is a precious and wonderful thing.
But you just can't sit there and let it lap around you.
You have to dive into it.
Taste it. Feel it.
You have to use it.
And the more you use, the more you have.
That's the wonder of it.
Would you like some more dessert, Mr. Duke?
No, thank you, Mrs. Biddle.
It's delicious, though.
Is something wrong, Mr. Duke?
Well, lookit there.
Well, it's Lucy.
I'll bet she's been hiding under there all day where it's warm.
John!
John, look what I found.
Are you all right, Mr. Duke?
Yes.
Thank you.
I don't feel well.
I think I'm getting a cold.
Cordy, why don't you take
Mr. Duke into the parlor?
Yes, ma'am?
John, bring some more coffee into the parlor, will you?
You little devil.
Decided to make a holiday of it, did you?
I told you he keeps alligators.
It's not that.
I mean, it's not just that.
Cordy, he scares me to death.
But that's the whole trouble.
You've got to stand up to him.
I think he'd punch me in the nose.
Punch him back.
Or better still, punch him first.
What?
When he comes in here, you've got to talk up to him.
Whatever he says, you dive right in and contradict him.
Even when he's right?
Especially when he's right.
Cordy, I couldn't do that.
Angie, I want him to like you.
And I'm telling you how to go about it.
Are you feeling better,
Mr. Duke?
Yes.
Thank you.
It was a little close in there.
Yes, in this cold weather one has to be so careful.
Going out of doors, coming in.
Cold weather's good for you.
It clears the lungs.
Puts the heart to work.
I like hot weather.
You do?
Yes, sir.
I do.
Well...
Now we know.
Over here, please, John.
Mr. Biddle, I understand you're a real boxing enthusiast.
Well, yes.
Yes, for some years now, I...
I never could see much in it.
As a sport.
I mean, two men just standing there hitting each other.
It doesn't seem to have much subtlety to it.
- It doesn't?
- No, sir.
John, bring in the gloves.
The boxing gloves, sir?
Yes, the boxing gloves.
Anthony, what are you thinking of?
I want to show Mr. Duke some of the subtleties of the sport and correct his false impression.
John and I can box a quick couple of rounds.
Me, Mr. Biddle?
Fightin' you, sir?
In my parlor?
Just a demonstration.
Mr. Duke, would you mind moving that chair out of the way?
The medium gloves, John.
Pardon me, Cordy.
Anthony, I really don't think this is the time or the place.
We don't have to stand on ceremonies with Mr. Duke.
He's practically a member of the family.
- Right, Mr. Duke?
- Right, sir.
As a matter of fact, sir,
I was just wondering.
Why can't I try it?
What's that?
Why can't I fight you?
Without knowing what you're doing?
From what I've seen of the sport, there can't be that much to it.
- Well, Mr. Duke...
- Anthony.
I don't think so.
I thought this was one house where a man could get a fair fight.
John, give Mr. Duke your gloves.
Gladly, sir.
Allow me, Mr. Biddle.
Cordy, can you help me with these?
I don't think you have to go this far.
Please.
Okay.
There.
You keep time, John.
Cordelia, he wants to.
You heard him.
Anthony, I hope you know what you're doing.
I'll be careful with him.
That isn't exactly what I meant.
Are we ready, gentlemen?
Yes.
You ready, Mr. Duke?
- Yes, sir.
- We'll see if we can't show you there's more to boxing than you think there is.
- All right, John.
- Time.
Never take your eye off your opponent, Mr. Duke.
Mr. Duke, boxing is called the art of self-defense for good reason.
That means you're supposed to protect yourself.
Your stomach.
Your chin.
Keep circling, Angie.
Keep circling.
You see, Mr. Duke?
If I'd been throwing hard punches, you'd be in trouble.
Protect yourself.
Keep your chin tucked, Angie.
- My chin what?
- Tucked.
No, just keep it behind your shoulder there so you don't get hurt.
All right, now you throw some punches at me, Mr. Duke.
Never lead with your right,
Mr. Duke.
You're open for a left hook.
See?
Throw another punch.
Now the stomach.
See?
You're not protecting yourself.
Little more subtle than you thought, isn't it?
Hey.
Wait.
Now, wait a minute.
Wait a minute, Mr. Duke.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Mr. Duke!
Wait a minute now.
You see, Mr. Duke.
- Angie!
- You ran right into my glove.
Will you need the ice?
He's all right.
Aren't you, Mr. Duke?
Yes, sir.
Sure, I'm okay.
Well, I hope you're not upset with me.
No. If I were upset,
I'd take care of you.
You'd take care of me?
That's right.
Well, now, I find myself wondering about that.
- You do?
- Yes, indeed, I do.
Excuse me, John.
Sir, would you take your boxing stance right here, please?
Angie.
Cordy, would you stand right over here?
Now what?
Papa!
Say, that's a pretty good trick.
Will you be needing the ice, sir?
Anthony, you all right?
Of course I'm all right.
He caught me unawares, that's all.
Would you care to try it again, sir?
Awares?
Confound it, boy.
I've had my share of roughhouse fighting.
Couldn't all this wait for another time?
The coffee's getting quite cold.
Don't worry, Mrs. Biddle.
No one will get hurt.
At least I won't.
What do you want to do?
Wrestle?
It's called jujitsu, sir.
It's a little like wrestling, yes.
Angie, please.
Have you gone crazy?
Yes, I think I have, Cordy.
And I feel right at home.
Mr. Duke, are you all right?
Is he all right?
I hope I didn't hurt you, sir.
Nothing that won't wear off.
That's a grand style of fighting, sir.
I'd like to learn it meself.
I got a feeling it might come in handy someday.
We've all got to learn it.
Every last man in the Philadelphia Corps.
Mr. Duke, I want to thank you.
That's a remarkable thing.
It could mean the difference between life and death in hand-to-hand combat.
You will teach it to me, won't you?
Yes, of course, sir.
And then, one of these days, we'll have a return match.
Well, Cordelia, these two young people haven't been alone all evening.
Yes, well, it's time to say good night.
It's been so nice having you,
Mr. Duke.
- May I call you Angie?
- Please.
Well, then, good night, Angie.
And we'll see you very soon.
Good night, dear.
- Good night, Mr. Duke.
- Good night, sir.
- Jujitsu, is it?
- Yes, sir.
By George, it's remarkable.
Good night, Cordy.
Papa.
Papa.
Thank you.
Thank me for what?
He could've killed me.
Can we announce our engagement soon?
- Yes, of course.
- Why not?
And can I go to New York and meet Angie's family?
Definitely.
The Biddles and the Dukes will have to get to know each other.
The sooner, the better.
Angier!
Angier, you sly boy.
Whatever have you gone and done?
Mother, I'd like you to meet Cordelia.
So this is the girl.
The one you have picked out of all the world to be yours alone.
My goodness.
Why, I nearly fainted when I got your call.
Engaged.
Imagine that.
And to a girl from Philadelphia.
We're going to have a busy schedule.
Mother, I hope you haven't told people.
- Cordy and I thought...
- Only a select few.
Come along, Cordelia, dear.
Everyone who knows is frantic to entertain you.
Lorraine Mansfield called three times.
Angie.
I thought you'd never come.
I know. I got stuck with my cousin Margaret.
I'm freezing.
I'll fix that.
Angier?
Are you out here?
Oh, so you are.
Behind a bush.
We came out for a little fresh air, Mother.
The last thing we need, Angier, is for you to come down with a cold.
We'll be right in, Mother.
Well, I'd appreciate it.
People are asking for you.
Excuse me.
Papa!
Cordy!
Let me look at you.
You're going to end up a real beauty if you're not careful.
Oh, Papa.
Oh, I'm so glad to see you.
Oh, it's good to see you, sweetheart.
Come over here and sit down.
Now, tell me.
How do you like the big city?
Oh, fine.
There's always something going on.
You get along with the Dukes all right?
Yes, of course.
Perfectly.
Cordy?
Mr. Biddle!
- How are you, son?
- Just fine, sir.
Keeping that jujitsu in good practice?
I've been doing a little practicing myself.
Angier!
Oh, Mother.
Oh.
Mother, may I introduce
Mr. Biddle?
Oh!
Oh, well, this is a happy surprise.
I'm very pleased to meet you, Mrs. Duke.
Is it quite safe?
A beautiful woman has always been safe with me.
I doubt that, Mr. Biddle.
Mrs. Duke, Mrs. Biddle and I are sorry we've had to refuse the kind invitations we've received.
But, well, it seems this war has been taking up all my time.
We've all been disappointed, naturally.
What finally brought you to New York?
- I'm on tour.
- Tour?
With a squad of Marines.
We demonstrate bayonet techniques.
In auditoriums, theaters.
Anywhere we can find the space.
Whatever for?
It's a recruiting device.
Stirs the blood to see these men locked in hand-to-hand combat.
I'm sure it must.
We're just passing through
New York on our way to Boston.
I couldn't resist stopping off between trains to see my little girl.
It's been a treat for all of us.
You'll join our party, of course?
I'm afraid I can't, Mrs. Duke.
I have a 10:00 train to catch.
Well, I'll go with you to the station.
Good, Cordy.
I'd like that.
If you'll excuse her for a while, Mrs. Duke.
But of course.
Excuse me.
I'll get my wrap.
I can get you a cab, sir.
Oh, thank you.
Well, it won't be long now.
The wedding in Philadelphia.
No, no.
It won't be long.
And how do you like it?
They make a handsome couple.
Oh, you don't like it any better than I do.
It takes getting used to.
Wasn't too long ago that Angie wouldn't pick a suit of clothes without asking my opinion.
Now he goes off to Lakewood for a weekend and picks someone to spend the rest of his life with.
Yes.
Well, Mrs. Duke,
I want to thank you for the generous way you've entertained my daughter.
It's my pleasure, Mr. Biddle.
I love spectacle.
Well, I'm not so sure how spectacular you'll find Philadelphia.
But we'll certainly do our best.
I'm sure you will.
Good night.
Good night.
I think I might be coming home next week.
Oh?
But I thought you were going to stay till the end of the month.
Well, I'm awfully tired.
You're sure there's nothing wrong?
Of course I'm sure.
I just want to curl up in my own bed in my own room and stay there for about a week.
They're not like us, Papa.
? When a man has a daughter?
? She's always in his heart?
? Happiness is part of all his prayers?
? When a man has a daughter?
? He wants her life to be?
? As smooth as satin ribbons that she wears?
? What's wrong with that??
? What's wrong with that??
? I want her home, where she's free of care?
? I miss her footsteps on the stairs?
? What's wrong with that??
Mrs. Duke?
Yes?
I found some more people for you to meet.
How delightful.
Gentlemen, this is Cordy's future mother-in-law.
Mrs. Duke, may I present Joe Turner?
Glad to know you, Mrs. Duke.
Joe is one of the mainstays in my Bible classes.
You'd never believe he was a bum and a drunk when I found him.
Mr. Biddle sure saved me, all right.
- He's tops on my list.
- I'm sure.
You're marrying into a fine family.
Yes.
We'll try to be deserving.
And this is Bill O'Brien.
Bill once fought for the heavyweight title.
If I'd have lasted that third round, I'd have got him.
I was just gettin' onto his tricks.
It's really something to fight for the title.
Oh, there's Madame LaFarge.
Finest voice teacher in Philadelphia.
Do you like opera, Mrs. Duke?
Sometimes.
Madame LaFarge sings a mean "Carmen."
Would you excuse me?
Nice party, huh, Mrs. Duke?
Oh, yes.
Colorful.
We can't let New York outclass Philadelphia.
Thanks, John.
Say, I could use another slug of that champagne punch.
How about you, Mrs. Duke?
Oh, no, thank you.
I haven't finished the slug
I already have.
Tell me.
Does Mr. Biddle often present himself in concert?
From time to time, ma'am.
He sang once at a real opera.
Dressed up like a clown, he was.
And sang out loud and clear through the whole thing.
It sounds as though he were appropriately costumed.
Papa did "Pagliacci" with the Manhattan Opera Company.
You're joking.
At least he feels like singing.
Well, so do I sometimes.
But I keep it to myself.
Aren't you having anything to eat?
You might like the sour pickles.
Oh, shut up.
Hi.
You're crying.
You're late.
Is that why you're crying?
No.
I'm crying because...
Oh, I don't know why.
Cordy, there has to be a reason.
Angie.
We're gonna be married in just three days.
I know.
I'm afraid.
Ever since we got engaged,
I never see you alone.
We never talk.
We never touch.
I seem like a total stranger to you, right?
You feel it, too?
Yes, Cordy.
That's why I was late today.
I was so nervous and worried about everything,
I decided to take a walk to clear my mind.
To get things straight.
I walked clear to the Delaware River.
Oh, Angie.
We can't let this happen.
Everything will be all right once we get away from parties and our families and we're on our way to Detroit.
What is it?
- Hold it!
- Cordy.
Just a minute, Mr. Duke.
I'd like another picture.
Later.
Is something wrong?
Cordy, there's something I have to tell you about Detroit.
Yes?
Well, I've been giving it some thought.
And I've come to the conclusion...
Angier!
Where have you been?
I feel like Daniel in the lions' den.
Excuse me.
I shouldn't stay away from my guests too long.
Mother, why do you have to act this way?
Oh, forgive me.
I don't believe it is my behavior that is questionable here.
What about those wedding invitations?
I don't know yet.
And you promised not to mention it.
But we have to know.
Mother, this is a very difficult time for me.
And I wish you'd help me out by going along with the Biddles' way of doing things.
After all, this is their house.
Angier, are you snapping at me?
Why, that's not like you.
Oh, never mind.
We'll help each other.
I promise I will do everything I can to keep the atmosphere peaceful.
Thank you, Mother.
And when we are out of all this madness and you're on your way to the Ozarks...
Mother, I warned you not to talk about that.
Oh, yes.
So you did.
Tell me. Is there anything
I can talk about?
Is there no one to answer the door?
Where are the servants?
They're out there.
Fighting for their lives.
Young man, tell Mr. Biddle
I'm waiting in the parlor.
I have no intention of going out into that mob.
Yes, ma'am.
Do you know who that young man is?
That is Angier Duke.
There are those who would consider the heir to a multimillion-dollar fortune improper choice for errand boy.
And there are those sufficiently accustomed to wealth that the only thing to be considered in such a choice is how well will the young man perform the errand.
Good afternoon, Mrs. Drexel.
But I will have a closer look when he comes back.
He must be quite something if Cordy can spend a month in New York and still want to marry him.
If you ladies will make yourselves comfortable,
I'll fetch some nice refreshments.
There are those who consider New York the only true city in the country.
And there are those who wear bibs when they eat.
But generally speaking, they are not persons of influence.
- Indeed.
- Indeed.
Champagne punch and some darling little sandwiches.
? There are those whose social standing?
? Is constantly demanding?
? Every single thing we do, the public knows?
? Then there is a lower strata?
? Where propriety doesn't matter?
? I suppose?
? There are those?
? There are those?
? There are those to whom position?
? Is a natural-born condition?
? To be worn with ease like comfortable old clothes?
? Though the nouveau riche deny it?
? All their money cannot buy it?
? Class will out?
Goodness knows.
? But there are those?
Watercress on toast, ma'am?
? There are those who grace the pages of the Blue Book?
Never heard of it.
Is it a new book?
Simply anyone who is anyone is listed.
Oh. You mean the New York telephone directory?
Hardly.
There are those whose names predate the Constitution.
Yes, and some of them opposed the Revolution.
Conservative.
Reactionary.
Cream cheese and cucumber?
? Philadelphia is the cradle of liberty?
? Slumbering like an aging page of history?
Chopped liver?
? There are those who flaunt prosperity?
? There are those who flaunt austerity?
? Posing cozy on their rosy status quos?
Poison dart?
I mean, raisin tart?
? There are those quite influential?
? There are those inconsequential?
? There are those?
? There are those?
? There are those?
? There are those?
? There are those?
- I suppose.
- I suppose.
- There are those.
- There are those.
Well, Mrs. Duke,
I see you've met Aunt Mary.
Good afternoon, Aunt Mary.
Aunt Mary, I was looking for you in the garden.
Not in that mob.
Hello, Aunt Mary.
Cordy.
Aunt Mary, this is Angie.
They've met.
Mrs. Drexel, I would like to ask you a question or two about how weddings are managed by proper Philadelphians.
Mother, you promised.
What about the way weddings are managed by Philadelphians?
Would anyone like a sandwich?
No.
No, thank you, John.
Is something wrong, Mrs. Duke?
Something is decidedly wrong.
I'll have a sandwich.
Let's all have a sandwich.
What about the wedding?
They really look delicious.
Won't you have one, Mother?
I've already had one.
What about the wedding, blast it?
I would like to know,
Mr. Biddle, why the Dukes have not received invitations.
As I understand it, the Drexels and the Biddles are coming by the thousands.
It is customary in most societies to invite the family of the groom as well.
But there was a separate box of Duke invitations.
Yes.
Yes, I remember that.
Could something have gone wrong at the post office?
John and I took them in ourselves.
- John?
- Sir.
See if you can find out anything.
Yes, sir.
I'm sure there's some simple explanation.
We'll certainly take care of it, Mrs. Duke.
These little things happen.
Little things?
How would you feel if the
Drexels had not been invited?
They'd come anyhow.
They're relatives.
It may surprise you to know that the laws of kinship operate in New York and in North Carolina.
Only one thing surprises me,
Mrs. Duke.
Wait a minute.
If you could just...
Stop it!
All of you!
Duke pride.
Drexel pride.
Biddle pride.
Philadelphia versus New York.
I'm sick to death of it.
Angie and I have been shoved aside while everyone is busy turning our wedding into the biggest production and the biggest fight in history.
It isn't fair.
And I'm not going to let it go on this way if Angie and I have to elope!
Elope?
And make us all look like fools?
At this moment, Mrs. Duke,
I don't care what you look like.
Cordy.
Angier, you had better speak to your bride.
This wedding is going to take place on schedule.
And it is going to be done right.
Once you're safe in our railroad car and on your way to Arkansas, you can indulge your whim.
Until then...
Arkansas?
What about Arkansas?
Cordy, I'm sorry.
Well, what are you sorry about?
I have arranged for our private railroad car to take you and Angier to Hot Springs then back to New York in two weeks for the board of directors' meeting.
Angie.
How could you?
Well, what, please tell me, is wrong with Hot Springs?
I'm sure nothing is wrong with it, Mrs. Duke.
But I'm not going to spend my honeymoon there.
Cordy, if we could just talk things over.
Just like I'm not going to live in New York.
Of course you're going to live in New York.
Because I'm not going to marry you.
What?
- Cordy.
You most certainly are going to marry him.
She doesn't have to if she doesn't want to.
Anthony.
What happened to the person
I fell in love with?
A person with dreams and spirit.
Someone I could believe in and root for.
Someone who could make a car any color you want.
Oh, no.
I'm not getting married.
- Then I'm not, either!
- Sir!
I found them, sir.
200 invitations.
They were lost under the clothes we collected for the Chinese missions.
That's very funny.
No.
It really is.
You'll pardon me for not laughing.
Angier!
Angier!
Angier!
John, maybe you'd better follow him.
Yes, sir.
Mr. Biddle, what do you intend to do about this?
Do about it?
Yes. You do intend to do something, don't you?
Yes, Anthony.
What now?
Well, I don't know.
What do you suggest?
I suggest you talk some sense into your daughter.
For once I agree with Mrs. Duke completely.
Wait a minute.
What about trying to talk some sense into your son, Mrs. Duke?
I'll take care of Angier.
Mrs. Duke, may I offer you a lift to your hotel?
My electric is waiting outside.
Oh, how very kind of you.
It's comforting to know that there are those who can be relied upon for support in times of stress.
They're trying to lay this whole mess in my lap.
We'd better get back to our guests.
They're trying to blame me.
Anyone can misplace a box of invitations, can't they?
You know very well, Anthony, the invitations have nothing to do with it.
That was just fate lending you a helping hand.
Blast.
I didn't do anything wrong.
Did I, George?
- Hey, here he is!
- Come on, Mr. Biddle.
- We want to drink a toast.
- To the father of the bride!
Now, just a second.
- Outside!
- A toast!
Three cheers!
? For he's a jolly good fellow?
? For he's a jolly good fellow?
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Stout!
Did you ever try a good Irish stout?
Look, you stay away from me.
Just a friendly suggestion, sir.
You followed me here, didn't you?
The devil, I did.
Do you think you're the only person that comes into Clancy's for a little rest and relaxation?
All right, just leave me alone and keep your suggestions to yourself.
Stout.
I'm tired of people running my life for me.
As well you should be, sir.
Leading me by the hand.
Telling me what to do.
It's a crime.
A man has to finally be a man.
- Right!
- Right!
? Well, well, well,
"Let's have a drink on it"?
? As me father used to say?
? "When the truth is nobly spoken?
? It's respect you've got to pay"?
? So fill your cup and lift it up?
? And clink, here's how?
? No shilly-shallying, no dillydallying?
? Let's have a drink on it now?
? No shilly-shallying, no dillydallying?
? Let's have a drink on it now?
I don't mind telling you.
These last weeks have really been rough.
That's a fact.
You try to please everybody.
And you end up pleasing no one at all.
'Tis the sad, sad truth, sir.
I'll get away from it all.
Good idea.
I'll leave Philadelphia and never come back.
- Never?
- Never.
Well, why shouldn't I?
There's nothing but trouble for me here.
There's nothing but trouble for me anywhere.
If I were to go to the ends of the Earth...
That's it.
I could join the Foreign Legion.
The Foreign Legion, sir.
A fine group of men, sir.
I'd be on my own, then, right?
Right!
? Well, well, well, let's have a drink on it?
? To the fightin'
Legionnaires?
? To their outposts in the desert?
? And their gorgeous
Croix de Guerres?
? To sailing for Bengasi on a rusty scow?
? No shilly-shallying, no dillydallying?
? Let's have a drink on it now?
? No shilly-shallying, no dillydallying?
? Let's have a drink on it now?
Thank you, John.
I'll always be grateful for your help.
Where are you going?
To Bengasi.
Like we said.
I can't let him get away.
We'll never get things patched up.
Sir!
A moment of your time, sir!
Just a moment!
? What do you do when the water's gone?
? And there's no turning back??
? You're four days from the fort?
? The Arab renegades attack?
? And the blistering sun keeps burning?
? Reinforcements can't get through?
? What do you do about it??
? What do you do about it??
Do you blister easily?
Yes, as a matter of fact.
The Foreign Legion is not for you.
Drink up.
You're right, John.
Running away isn't the answer.
You're right.
I'm right, all right.
I've got to face my problem head on.
All right.
What's my problem?
My problem is my family.
It always has been.
I'll change my name.
Renounce my fortune.
That's good thinking.
I'll take an honest job.
In a factory.
Or on a farm.
Maybe someday I'll have my own place.
- Beautiful!
- I'll be like everybody else.
Poor, right?
- Right!
- Right!
? Well, well, well, let's have a drink on it?
? To the simple, average life?
? To the wages every Friday?
? That you bring home to the wife?
? To the sweat of honest labor on your average brow?
? No shilly-shallying, no dillydallying?
? Let's have a drink on it now?
? No shilly-shallying, no dillydallying?
? Let's have a drink on it now?
Hey!
Set 'em up, Clancy!
Whoo!
Hey!
The drinks are on the Duke!
? No shilly-shallying, no dillydallying?
? Let's have a drink on it now?
Thank you all!
I can't tell you how much this talk has meant to me.
Not at all at all.
- I'll write when I get settled.
- You'll write...
From where are you gonna write?
When a man has reached a turning point in his life, why waste time?
? What do you do when you lose your job??
? The rent is overdue??
? The landlord throws you in the street?
? The wife, the kiddies, too?
? And the sleet and snow are falling?
? And you've got no place to go?
Will you shut your face?
Can't you see I'm talking to the gentleman?
? What do you do about it??
? What do you do about it??
The simple, average life, sir.
No.
Have a drink.
I'm used to having money.
I might as well admit it.
I know.
I could make my own fortune.
- I could drill for oil in Texas.
- Think it over carefully.
- I could pan for gold in Alaska.
- Don't be too hasty.
Wait.
The pearl trade in China.
The mysterious East.
Who knows what adventures
I might live there?
- Right.
- Right!
- Wrong.
-? Well, well, well?
? Let's have a drink on it?
? Here's to China across the bay?
? To them darling little oysters?
? And the pearls they give away?
? A man could make his fortune there?
? I will somehow?
? No shilly-shallying, no dillydallying?
? I'm off to China now?
? No shilly-shallying, no dillydallying?
? He's off to China now?
? No shilly-shallying, no dillydallying?
? Let's have another one, sir!?
? No shilly-shallying, no dillydallying?
Ha!
Ooh! Ooh!
? No shilly-shallying, no dillydallying?
? I'm off to China now?
? Well, well, well, one last drink on it?
? Then you're on your merry way?
? What do you do when your sampan springs a leak?
? In China Bay??
? When the truth is nobly spoken?
? It's respect you've got to pay?
? Them Oriental pirates come and take your pearls away?
? So fill your cup and lift it up?
-? And clink, here's how?
- Do you eat fish heads?
? No shilly-shallying, no dillydallying?
? Let's have a drink on it now?
Are you immune to yellow fever?
Bubonic plague!
Monsoons!
Locusts!
The screaming abdabs!
Oh, the shame of it all!
Do that again, me buckle, and you won't be going anywhere.
Clancy, two more.
Have a drink, sir.
All the very best.
Are you all right, lad?
There's nothing broken, I hope.
I think we best be going to the hotel to have the house doctor take a look at you.
Excuse me, John.
Aah!
Oh! Oh!
Oh!
Oh! Oh!
Ooh!
All right, I say!
Quiet!
Quiet!
All right, now.
Who started all this?
Well, come on.
Come on.
Somebody speak up, or I'll jail the lot of youse just as sure as my name's Flanagan.
Seems a shame to punish men for defending their mother country.
What's that?
I wasn't a part of it meself, you understand.
But I did see it all from first to last.
And?
Well, it all started when the young gentleman there expressed the opinion that all Irishmen were pigs.
And the Emerald Isle the proper sty for them.
Oh, he did, did he?
Huh?
He did indeed.
I see.
All right, you two.
Bring young Mr. Fancy Dan along.
Hey!
And I'll thank you to come along, too, sir.
The captain will be delighted to hear what you told me.
I consider it me duty, Sergeant.
All right.
Bring him along.
Have no fear, lad.
I'm looking out for you.
Good morning, Cordelia.
How is Cordy this morning?
Have you seen her?
I had a cold shower and a good, brisk walk.
And now I'm hungry.
Thank you, my dear.
Yes, ma'am?
Yes, sir?
I think I'll start with some orange juice.
Who are you?
I'm Deborah, sir.
Well.
Good morning, Deborah.
Good morning, sir.
I think after the orange juice
I'd like some cereal.
Yes, sir.
Pleasant-enough-looking girl, isn't she?
Confound it, Cordelia.
You can't go on ignoring me like this forever.
And that's how long it will be before I respond to such childish behavior.
What do you want from me?
Let's hear it.
Some kind of confession.
That's what you want, isn't it?
You're not going to get it.
I have nothing to confess.
Will that be hot or cold cereal, sir?
Neither one, blast it!
I'm not hungry.
I will admit I have wondered if Angie was the right man for Cordy.
But she made her choice.
And I accepted it,
I think, gracefully.
I've just been myself, that's all.
You've been yourself in spades.
Cordelia.
Where did you learn that back-room expression?
You played into every possible source of trouble from the first.
Oh, there was trouble to play into, I'll grant.
You didn't create it, but how you took advantage.
I deny that.
Then let me put it this way.
Have you done one thing to help this marriage?
I don't believe that's my responsibility.
Isn't it, Anthony?
I know of nothing
I've done wrong.
Nothing.
You know it in your heart.
Or you wouldn't be so angry.
Good morning.
Good morning, Mother.
Good morning, Papa.
How about a jog around the square?
Why, Cordy.
Or maybe a few rounds in the gym?
Confound it, Cordy.
You can't come popping in here, gay as a cricket.
Why not?
How should I be?
Cordy.
What are we going to do?
About what, Mother?
About your marriage.
It's been called off.
Don't you remember?
I'll be in the stable.
Cordy.
Cordy, wait.
Cordy.
I don't want to talk about it, Papa.
I don't want to talk, either.
But that doesn't mean
I'm not going to.
There's nothing to talk about.
You never really approved of Angie.
And you were right.
He's a baby.
A mama's boy.
He doesn't know what life is all about.
He'll learn.
Maybe you'll learn together.
But you can't take his part now.
I'm not taking his part.
But I've got nothing against that boy, Cordy.
I never did.
Except that I wanted you to stay here.
That's the truth.
You try to make a good life for yourself and your family.
And turns out to be too good.
So you can't resist trying to hold on.
Whatever you decide to do,
Cordy, I'll back you up 100%.
But you decide.
On your own.
It's your life.
I'm finally giving it over to you.
Where is he?
Good morning, Mrs. Duke.
If you know where he is, please tell me.
I'll find out in good time anyway.
Do you mean Angie?
Of course I mean Angier.
- Well, what's happened?
- He's disappeared.
Disappeared?
He wasn't in his hotel room all night.
His bed has not been slept in.
Who knows what has happened to him?
John!
Now, don't worry, Mrs. Duke.
We'll find him.
- John!
- You called, sir?
I yelled.
John, I thought I asked you to watch out for Mr. Duke.
- I did.
- What happened to your eye?
He hit me, sir.
Angier?
When?
Last night at the jailhouse.
The jailhouse?
They'll release him as soon as
I withdraw the charges, ma'am.
Well, we'd better get down there right away.
I'll hurry and get dressed.
Yes, Cordelia.
Mrs. Duke, why don't you wait out here on the terrace?
John, bring the car around front, will you?
We'll have this unfortunate situation cleared up in no time.
Oh, dear.
I may faint.
On this floor?
Don't even think of it.
Mrs. Duke, perhaps it'd be better if you ladies waited here.
All right, Mr. Duke.
You can come out now.
I'd just as soon stay right here.
Well, that's a pretty silly attitude.
It isn't silly at all.
I'm afraid if I stand up my head will fall off.
Did you ever try a good Irish stout?
Come along.
Come along, Mr. Duke.
It's time to go now.
Why couldn't you let me out last night when I wanted out?
Where was it you wanted to go last night?
I had decided on China.
How do feel about China this morning?
Terrible.
Sergeant, would you give us a minute?
Oh, certainly.
Certainly.
Young man.
It's time you woke up to your responsibilities.
I want you to get this marriage over with.
And that honeymoon in the Ozarks.
Then report back to your desk in New York.
What?
You may think you want other things for yourself.
You may have some dreams of your own.
But you'll have to get over all that.
The way other people do.
Well, you didn't get over it.
Well, there are darn few like me.
Now, you listen here,
Mr. Know-it-all Biddle.
No one is gonna run my life for me.
I've decided that much.
Hangover or no hangover.
Is that so?
Yes.
That is so.
All right, Mr. Duke.
The door's open.
Let's see you have a try at running your own life.
Let's see how far you can go.
Hangover or no hangover.
Mr. Biddle.
I am going to ask Cordy to elope with me.
- Today.
- Now, wait a minute.
And don't you try to stop me.
Let me tell you one thing.
If you ask Cordy to elope, she won't.
Then I'll tell her.
Angier.
Morning, Mother.
Cordy.
You and I are going to elope.
Over my dead body!
Only if absolutely necessary,
Mother.
We'll stop by your house and pick up your things.
No.
Why?
Because I think he talked you into it.
Cordy, I love you, and I want to marry you.
And he's got nothing to do with that.
I'm not so sure about that.
Papa!
So long, everybody.
We'll write.
Angier, where are you going?
? You can here it humming, see it coming?
? Feel it everywhere you go?
? It's tomorrow morning, the future dawning?
? With a bright and shining glow?
? It's a land where golden chariots?
? Are molded out of dreams?
? It's Detroit?
? Detroit?
? It's Detroit?
You know, there, for a minute, he reminded me of his grandfather.
Started the whole Duke thing.
If he's half the man
I think he is, this won't be the end of the whole Duke thing, either.
Did you hear that?
It's the floor, dear.
I never noticed it before.
This isn't a new house.
No.
No, it isn't.
I'm hungry.
Oh.
Poor dear.
You didn't have any breakfast, did you?
I'll ring for John.
I don't need much.
What's that?
Hmm?
The clock, dear.
Oh.
A new one?
We've had it 20 years.
Oh.
You rang, ma'am?
Could we have some tea, please?
And there must be some sandwiches left.
Oh, yes, ma'am.
Did everything turn out all right down at the jailhouse?
Angie and Cordy are on their way to Detroit.
Well.
That's grand news.
That's right.
That's right.
We're very happy about it.
I'll take that, ma'am.
Thank you, John.
Shouldn't we telephone the boys about the wedding?
Oh, they'll be in class.
That's right.
Better wait until this evening.
- It's been a long time...
- We should let Aunt Mary know.
- What was that, Cordelia?
- I was thinking.
Maybe we could do some traveling now that the children are all...
That's a good idea.
I've always wanted to travel.
We can go to Detroit and see Cordy and Angie.
Oh, Anthony.
Yeah.
? Let them go, let them go?
? Let them try their wings?
? Little birds were born to fly?
? Not until they roam can they miss their home?
? And it won't be long till Christmas?
? When the branches are bare?
? The December air?
? Comes alive with frost and pine?
? And they'll yearn to be?
? By the family tree?
? Oh, it won't be long till Christmas?
? The years go by?
? And every night?
? You say, "Sweet dreams, sleep tight"?
? Then comes the day you're forced to say?
? "Don't forget to write"?
? There'll be holly and popcorn?
? And mistletoe?
? There'll be songs by fireglow?
? Oh, it won't be long till Christmas?
? Let them go?
? Let them go?
? It won't be long till Christmas?
? Let them go?
? Let them go?
Who would be dropping by this afternoon?
I can't imagine.
Hardly anybody lives here anymore.
The tea will be a moment.
Mrs. Worth's icing up a gorgeous chocolate cake.
Come in, gentlemen.
Sir, is Mr. Biddle at home?
Yes.
Will you come this way, please?
There's some gentlemen to see you, sir.
Well, look who's here.
- Mr. Biddle.
- Lieutenant.
- Mr. Biddle.
- Good to see you.
Sir, a set of orders have been received at our headquarters concerning your future relations with the Corps.
And we felt that these orders warranted personal delivery.
I don't believe it.
Anthony, what is it?
When I tried to enlist, they turned me down.
Said I was too old for active service.
Anthony, for heaven's sake.
Cordelia, I've been awarded a provisional captaincy in the Marine Corps.
I'm ordered to report to Parris Island.
- Congratulations, sir.
- Thank you.
Congratulations, Mr. Biddle.
- John!
- Yes, sir?
John, we're in the Marines.
- We are, sir?
- Yes.
Bring out some of that good Madeira, will you?
You know, gentlemen, there's something to which I've been giving a lot of thought.
The French and the British have been in this war for some time.
They must have perfected close-combat techniques which are more realistic than ours.
I feel that we ought to send someone over there to observe and learn.
Anthony, I don't think that somebody who's been in the Marines for less than five minutes should be trying to decide
Corps policy.
He's sure to end up running things, Mrs. Biddle.
He might as well start off that way.
Oh, thank you, John.
You should've brought one for yourself.
I'm not much at making speeches.
But I guess you know how we all feel about this.
Mr. Biddle has landed.
And the Marines are well in hand.
Right?
- Right!
- Right!
? Well, well, well?
? "Let's have a drink on it," as me father used to say?
? When the truth is nobly spoken?
? It's respect you've got to pay?
? So fill your cup and lift it up?
? And clink, here's how?
? No shilly-shallying, no dillydallying?
? Let's have a drink on it now?
? No shilly-shallying, no dillydallying?
? Let's have a drink on it now?
Excuse me, ma'am.
Well.
Congratulations, Captain Biddle.
Thank you, Cordelia.
- Where's Mr. Biddle?
- Step this way, gentlemen.
We rushed right over as soon as we heard, Captain.
? Well, well, well,
"Let's have a drink on it"?
? As me father used to say?
? When the truth is nobly spoken?
? It's respect you've got to pay?
? So fill your cup and lift it up?
? And clink, here's how?
? No shilly-shallying, no dillydallying?
? Let's have a drink on it now?
? No shilly-shallying...?
What on Earth is happening here now?
I understand Mr. Biddle is going off to war.
I'm glad to hear it.
Maybe we'll finally have some peace around here.
? Fortuosity?
? That's me byword?
? Fortuosity?
? Me twinkle-in-the-eye word?
? Sometimes castles fall to the ground?
? But that's where four-leaf clovers are found?
? Fortuosity?
? Lucky chances?
? Fortuitious little happy happenstances?
? I don't worry
'cause everywhere I see?
? That every bit of life is lit by fortuosity?
? Fortuosity?
? That's me own word?
? Fortuosity?
? Me never-feel-alone word?
? Around the corner, under a tree?
? Good fortune's waitin', just wait and see?
? Fortuosity?
? Lucky chances?
? Fortuitious little happy happenstances?
? I keep smilin'
'cause my philosophy?
? Is do your best and leave the rest?
? To fortuosity?
? I keep smilin'
'cause my philosophy?

At this very moment,
KID-TV has standing by a television crew at
Santa Claus' workshop.
And in just a few seconds, our special correspondent,

ANDY HENDERSON
(ON TV): Hi, kids.
This is Andy Henderson at the North Pole.
Whoo, it's cold up here.
From this spot, there's only one direction you can go, and that's south.
Living up here is pretty rough.
I don't see how Santa stands it.
Since we've been here, we've eaten nothing but frozen food.
At least, that's the way it is by the time we get it.
And now, let's take a looksee into Santa's workshop.
Hello again.
Boys and girls, it's just weeks before Christmas, and Santa and his helpers are working overtime to make sure that there's enough toys for the kids all over the world.
Santa's a pretty busy man, but I'm sure he'd like to say a few words to you kids.
Hello, Santa.
SANTA CLAUS (ON
TV): Oh, hello, son.
Oh, well, hello boys and girls.
Hey... oh, Andy, you caught me at a very busy time.
ANDY HENDERSON (ON
TV): Well, uh, you think you'll be ready by Christmas Eve?
SANTA CLAUS (ON TV):
Well, we've never disappointed the kids yet.
ANDY HENDERSON (ON TV): Tell me, is it true that this year, there's a rumor that you're going to use a rocket sled?
SANTA CLAUS (ON TV): No sir-ee.
We're going out the good old fashioned way, with my reindeer... Prancer and
Dancer, and Donner and Blitzen, and Vixen and
Nixon... hey, Nixon?
Oh, where'd I get... Oh,
I always... confound it.
I get those names mixed up.
But the kids know their names.
MRS. CLAUS (ON TV):
Santa, there you are.
We have so much to do, and you stand here dawdling, talking to this visitor.
SANTA CLAUS (ON TV): Mr.
Anderson, this is Mrs. Claus.
Uh, well, dear, we're on television.
MRS. CLAUS (ON TV): How do you do, Mr. Anderson.
ANDY HENDERSON (ON TV): Ma'am.
MRS. CLAUS (ON TV):
Now, I want you to go and finish painting those hobby horses.
Television?
Did you say we're on television?
Oh, oh dear.
Oh, why didn't you tell me?
Oh, my hair's a mess.
Mm-mm... H-hello there.
Oh, oh!
SANTA CLAUS (ON TV):
Come along, Mr. Anderson, and I'll show you some of the new toys we're turning out.
How's it going, Winky?
WINKY (ON TV): Everything is A-OK, Santa.
SANTA CLAUS (ON TV): Good man.
Winky is in charge of our space department.
ANDY HENDERSON (ON TV): Ah.
SANTA CLAUS (ON
TV): Oh, now here, here is the latest toy rocket.
It runs on real rocket fuel.
ANDY HENDERSON (ON TV): Really?
I've been wondering, what is this strange little creature over here?
SANTA CLAUS (ON TV):
Oh, uh, Winky made that.
That's his idea of a Martian.
ANDY HENDERSON (ON
TV): A Martian?
Wow-ee-wow, I'd hate to meet a creature like that on a dark night.
SANTA CLAUS (ON TV): Oh-ho-ho.
ANDY HENDERSON (ON
TV): I wonder if there really are people on Mars.
SANTA CLAUS (ON TV):
Well, who knows.
ANDY HENDERSON (ON
TV): Well, if there are, I hope they have someone like you up there, Santa, to bring joy and good cheer to all the Martian children.
SANTA CLAUS (ON TV): Oh,
Mr. Anders... Ho-ho-ho.
Well, keep going, Winky.
Christmas Eve is coming soon.
Now Mr. Anderson, I want to show you some more things.
Now you...
Dropo?
Dropo, you lazy, good-for-nothing, where are you?
Dropo, Dropo, wake up.
Wake up.
[LAUGHING]
Oh, please turn off that tickle ray.
KIMAR: Stand up.
Stand up.
Stand up.
Stand up.
I'm sorry, Ki... Kimar, sir.
Dropo, you are the laziest man on Mars.
Why are you sleeping during working hours?
I wasn't sleeping, Chief.
It's just that I haven't been able to sleep these last few nights.
I forgot how.
So I was just practicing.
Well I suggest you practice doing your work.
Where's Lady Momar?
Oh, she went to the food pill center to get some new food pills.
The children haven't been eating well.
No appetite at all.
Oh, it's no wonder.
They sit in front of the video set all day, watching those ridiculous
Earth programs.
It confuses them.
Where are they?
Oh, in there watching
Earth programs.
ANDY HENDERSON (ON TV): Say,
Santa, what have we here?
SANTA CLAUS (ON TV):
These are new dolls.
Now, this little doll walks, talks, cries, and she even sings.
ANDY HENDERSON (ON TV): Almost like a real, live little girl.
SANTA CLAUS (ON TV): That she is sir, that she is.
All she needs is tender loving care.
Bomar, what is a doll?
I don't know, Girmar.
What is tender loving care?
I don't know, either.
Bomar, Girmar, I told you not to watch those silly Earth programs.
Now go to sleep.
Must we go to sleep now, Father?
I want to see Santa
Claus some more.
I want to see more toys.
No.
Go to sleep.
Hello, Dropo.
I see you're keeping busy.
Oh, I've been working very hard, Lady Momar.
I've been vacuuming the room.
Good.
Is the master here?
Oh, he's in there.
And Kimar is very angry, too.
Kimar, I bought some new food pills.
I hope the children will eat these.
We have hamburger, buttered asparagus, mashed potatoes, and a special treat for them, chocolate layer cake pills.
Momar, I'm worried about our children.
So am I. They've hardly eaten a thing in three days.
It goes deeper than that.
They're behaving strangely.
They appear to be troubled.
They don't care to sleep.
I had to use the sleep spray on them again.
I mentioned this to my council chiefs today, and I learned it's the same with children all around the planet, in every district.
Something is happening to the children of Mars.
Kimar, as the leader of the Martians, you must do something about it.
I know, but what?
Why don't you go to the forest and see
Chochem, the ancient one.
He'll know what to do.
He's never failed you.
You speak wisely.
I will go.
Attention, council chiefs.
Please report.
COUNCIL CHIEF (ON
INTERCOM): Lomas reporting.
COUNCIL CHIEF (ON
INTERCOM): Rigna reporting.
COUNCIL CHIEF (ON
INTERCOM): Hargo here.
Voldar?
Voldar, please report.
COUNCIL CHIEF (ON
INTERCOM): Voldar reporting.
Gentlemen of the council, we will meet immediately at Chochum's Chair in Thunder Forest.
COUNCIL CHIEF (ON INTERCOM):
What's wrong now, Kimar?
I don't know, Voldar.
But I mean to find out.
Where's Kimar?
He should be here any moment.
What's this all about?
We'll find out when Kimar arrives.
We are probably going to seek the advice of Chochum.
What does Kimar think we are, a kindergarten class?
Can't we make our own decisions?
Must we always come crawling to that [INAUDIBLE] old man?
Chochum is 800 years old.
You can't dismiss the wisdom of centuries.
I can.
Gentlemen.
Thank you for coming.
Chochum?
Chochum, are you here?
Ancient One of Mars,
I call upon you.
Chochum, it is I, Kimar, and the council chiefs.
We need you, Chochum.
You called me, Kimar?
We need your advice, Chochum.
Something is wrong with our children.
They eat not.
They sleep not.
Their only interest is watching meaningless Earth programs on the video.
Wh-wh-what time of year is it now?
KIMAR: It is the middle of Septober.
No, no.
Not here.
I mean on Earth.
Ah, yes.
It is early December on Earth.
Close to the time of the Christmas.
That explains it.
What is a Christmas?
It is an occasion for great joy and peace on the planet Earth.
And for children, it is also a time of anticipation, as they await the arrival of
Santa Claus and his gifts.
Bah, what nonsense.
What has this to do with our children, Ancient One?
We have no children on Mars.
They have children's bodies, but with adult minds.
They do not have a childhood.
I've seen this coming for centuries.
They are born.
Our electronic teaching machines are attached to their brains while they are in their cradles.
Information is fed into their minds in a constant stream.
And by the time they can walk, they are adults.
They've never played.
They've never learned to have fun.
And now, now they are rebelling.
What do you advise?
The children must be allowed to be children again.
They must learn to play.
They must learn what it means to have fun.
We need a Santa Claus on Mars.
Santa Claus on Mars?
Where will we get a Santa Claus?
There's only one Santa
Claus, and he's on Earth.
Well, I guess that takes care of that.
Didn't I tell you it was a foolish idea to seek advice from that old man?
This is a serious matter, Voldar.
And desperate problems require desperate deeds.
Earth has had Santa
Claus long enough.
We will bring him to Mars.
I'm against it.
Our children are fine the way they are.
I don't want any Santa Claus bringing them toys and games.
They'll start playing and laughing and running under foot.
They'll become a nuisance.
I've made my decision.
We leave for Earth tonight.
Rigna, Lomas, prepare spaceship number one.
Approaching projected Earth orbit.
Fire port side rockets number one and number two.
Port side rockets number one and number two, fired.
Entering Earth orbit.
All right, Voldar.
Now to find Santa Claus.
Turn on your magnascope to third power.
We're over a city of some kind.
So that's what the Earth people call a city, eh?
How primitive.
Look at all those buildings above ground.
Why, we could destroy that city with one blast of our Q-ray.
We've not come here to destroy anyone.
Our only purpose is to bring
Santa Claus back to Mars.
Turn to fifth power.
Let's see if we can locate Santa Claus.
He wears a red suit, trimmed with white fur, and he has a long white beard.
But there are millions of people down there.
It's like looking for a speck of space dust in a comet's tail.
Wait a minute.
I see him.
I see Santa Claus.
I see him, too.
He's standing on the corner, ringing a bell.
No he's not.
He's standing near the entrance of a large building, next to a large black kettle.
He's standing on the corner, Kimar.
He's... wait a minute.
I see another one.
Why, there are hundreds of
Santa Clauses down there.
Are we going to bring them all back with us to Mars?
Just one.
And with so many, they won't miss one.
Prepare for landing on next orbit.
NEWS ANCHOR (ON
TV): We interrupt our program with a special bulletin.
An unidentified object has been spotted in orbit around the Earth.
The Soviet Union denies it has launched any new space satellites.
Our radar stations are tracking the spaceship, or whatever it is.
The US Air Force has alerted all defense commands and retaliatory units.
Sir, Earth radar beams are bouncing off our ship.
Well, it certainly took them long enough.
Voldar, turn on the radar shield.
Dysfunctioning of radar shield.
Rigna, check the radar box.
Radar shield functioning.
What was wrong, Rigna?
A slight case of Dropo.
Oh, hi Chief.
What are you doing here, Dropo?
Oh, well, Chief, I went to the launching pad so I could say goodbye to you, and I remembered,
I've never been to Earth!
So I thought I wanted to see...
I may leave you there in place of Santa Claus.
Now get below.
I'll deal with you later.
Dropo, get below quickly.
Yes chief.
Yes.
Yes chief.
I'm sorry.
Prepare to land.
We'll set down in that field near the lake.
Rocket silencers set.
Rotor rockets number one and two, fire.
All this trouble over a fat little man in a red suit.
NEWS ANCHOR (ON TV): Here is another UFO bulletin.
The Defense Department has just announced that the unidentified flying object has suddenly disappeared from our radar screen.
They believe the object has either disintegrated in space, or it may be a spaceship from some other planet, which has the ability to nullify our radar beams.
Because of the ominous situation, the president has ordered the Strategic
Air Command into action.
[HORN BUZZING]
NEWS ANCHOR (VOICEOVER):
The Defense Department believes that the object spotted on our radar screens might have been nothing more than a meteor which burned up when it entered our atmosphere.
Professor [INAUDIBLE] Von
Green, our leading space expert, is still convinced it was a Martian spaceship.
Stay tuned for further bulletins.
Billy, what does a
Martian look like?
I don't know.
Nobody's ever seen one.
I don't believe there are any Martians.
You don't, huh?
What would you do if a Martian walked right up behind you?
I'd scream.
[SCREAMS]
Ah, stop doing that.
I'm trying to sleep.
I see a Martian.
Boy, you and your imagination.
Come on, let's go home.
Who... who are you?
We're from Mars.
Don't be afraid.
We have children just like you on Mars.
What are those funny things sticking out of your head.
Those are our antenna.
Are you a television set?
Shh.
Stupid question.
Is this what you want to do to our children on Mars?
Turn them into nincompoops like these?
Hold your tongue, Voldar?
What's your name, little boy?
Billy.
Billy Foster, sir.
And this is my sister, Betty.
Well perhaps you can help us, Billy.
We're looking for one of your Santa Clauses.
There's only one Santa Claus.
We've seen many of them in your cities.
Oh.
Those are his helpers.
There's only one real Santa Claus.
And he's in his workshop up at the North Pole.
That's what we came here to find out.
Let's go.
Come on, you two.
Let me go!
Where are you taking us?
Leave them alone, Voldar!
What?
And leave them here to inform the authorities?
He's right, Kimar.
We'd better take them along with us to North Pole.
Very well.
Come along.
NEWS ANCHOR (ON TV): This morning, two children disappeared mysteriously in the vicinity of Welsh Lake.
The police have found no clues.
And it seems as though
Billy and Betty Foster have simply vanished into thin air.
This appears to be a day when everything is vanishing into thin air.
While local police are continuing their search for the missing children, the armed forces are continuing their search for the mysterious object from space.
All right, Billy and Betty.
Nobody here.
Come on in.
Golly.
Now, I'm not supposed to bring you here.
The chief's going to be awful mad if he finds us.
Boy, wait 'til the kids at home find that I was in a real
Martian spaceship.
No... no, don't touch anything.
Now, here.
That's the anti-gravity generator.
And these are the retro rockets.
Does this light up?
Only when radar waves are bouncing off our ship.
Then we put up this radar screen.
Then nobody can find us in space.
Boy, that's pretty sharp.
Yep.
What's this, Dropo?
Oh, that's the elevator signal.
That light starts flashing when somebody's coming up from the navigation deck.
Oh... oh, oh.
BILLY: Somebody's coming up.
We better get out of here.
No, no, no!
There's no time for that.
Oh, oh, I'm in trouble.
Oh, no time.
Here.
Here, here.
Quick.
Thinking of taking another nap in the radar box, Dropo?
Oh, oh, no sir.
As a matter of fact, I was just looking in there to remind myself never to hide in there again.
I bet.
No.
Approaching North Pole.
I can see Santa Claus' workshop.
Prepare for landing.
Hargo, set the rocket silences.
Dropo?
You stay aboard and guard those children.
They must not leave the ship now.
Now, or never?
What do you mean, Voldar?
If we take them with us to Mars,
Santa's disappearance would remain a mystery.
No one on Earth will ever know that Santa
Claus was kidnapped by Martians.
Perhaps you're right.
Dropo?
Yes sir?
Get back to those children, and don't let them out of your sight.
Understand?
Yes, sir I understand.
I... I'll keep an eye.
We've landed.
Secure the ship.
Lomas, you remain on guard and have the ship ready for immediate blast off.
Rigna, Hargo, Voldar, you'll accompany me.
Come.
We'll activate Torg.
Torg?
To capture a roly poly little man like Santa Claus?
We don't need Torg.
We won't take any chances.
Come.
Nothing can stop Torg.
They're going to kidnap
Santa Claus, and us, too.
Not if we can help it.
We've got to get out of here and warn Santa.
What's a Torg?
I don't know, but
I'm not afraid of it.
It's not going to stop us.
Come on.
Wait, Betty.
BETTY: Why did you do that?
If this ship ever leaves Earth, we'll have the whole US
Space Force after them.
Come on.
Wait a minute.
Come on.
BILLY: Come on, Betty.
This action must take place swiftly.
We can't afford to make any mistakes.
Hargo, you cover the rear of the workshop.
Rigna, Voldar, cover the front entrance.
I'll direct Torg.
Voldar isn't here.
Rigna, go up and tell Voldar... Voldar, this is another one of your delaying tactics.
You've been opposing me at every turn.
Now I'm warning you, change your attitude.
You finished, Chief?
Yes I am.
And you will be, too, if you're not careful.
Oh, but I am carefully, Chief.
So careful that I looked in at the children before I left the ship.
You stay away from those children.
That will be easy to do.
They've escaped.
Voldar, if this is your idea of a joke...
Ask Dropo.
They overheard our plans.
At this very moment, they're on their way to Santa Claus to warn him.
It's true, Kimar.
Their footprints.
We must stop them.
Those children mustn't reach Santa Claus.
Follow them.
I'll put Torg on the trail.
Torg, come out of the spaceship.
Torg.
Come out of the spaceship.
Billy, I can't run anymore.
I'm cold.
And I'm tired.
And it's beginning to snow.
Please, Betty.
Try.
We've got to warn Santa.
We can't stop now.
They might catch us.
Where is Santa?
BILLY: I don't know.
His workshop must be somewhere around here.
Betty, look.
It's Voldar.
BETTY: He's the mean one, the one who doesn't like us.
Come on.
Get back.
Don't move, Betty.
I'll go take a look.
It's all right now, Betty.
Come on.
I'm cold.
I wish it wouldn't snow.
That's the best thing that could happen.
It'll cover our tracks and be harder for the Martians to find us.
And it'll be harder for us to find Santa's workshop.
I'm scared.
We'll find it.
Which way is north?
I see it!
I see it!
Santa's workshop.
BILLY: Where?
Right there.
See the light?
Where?
The lights are moving.
They're coming towards us.
Betty, that's not Santa's house.
Wha... What is it?
BILLY: I don't know.
Good work, Torg.
Now destroy them.
Crush them.
Crush them, Torg.
Do as I say.
Voldar, I knew you'd try something like this.
I set Torg's controls so he will obey only me.
Release them, Torg.
You were very lucky.
Now don't try to escape again.
You may not be so lucky next time.
Hargo, take them back to ship, lock them up, and rejoin us.
You won't get away with this, you... you Martian!
The danger grows with every minute.
Let's get Santa
Claus and blast off.
We'll surround the workshop and send Torg in to get Santa.
Nobody is to be harmed unless they get in our way.
Right.
No one is to be harmed.
What has happened to the great warriors of our planet?
Mars used to be the planet of war.
Mark my words, Kimar, your softness will destroy us.
Santa Claus, toys, games, laughing children.
Well we shall see.
But for now, to your posts.
Torg, follow me.
Get him, Torg.
You can't come in here.
No one's allowed.
Well, where did you come from?
You're the biggest toy I've ever seen.
[LAUGHING]
And very well, made too.
By the great dog star, Santa's treating him like a toy.
Get him, Torg.
Grab him.
He's become a toy.
Rigna, we'll have to get Santa ourselves.
Come on, Voldar.
What have we here?
More toys?
Those are Martians.
Santa Claus, you're coming with us.
No.
You can't take him now.
It's too near Christmas.
Quiet, you.
But...
We don't want to hurt you, Santa Claus, so come along quietly.
Why... why did you have to do that to my helper?
It's harmless.
It'll wear off in a short while.
Oh.
Well, why didn't you say so in the first place?
Now you come with us.
We need you on Mars.
Are you sure this is harmless?
Oh, I never saw such lazy people, standing around like statues.
There's work to be done.
Let's get to it.
Oh me, oh my, oh me, oh... oh, Mrs. Claus is going to be very angry about this.
Take him, Torg.
Torg, take him.
Obey my command.
Forget it, Kimar.
Rigna was right.
He's nothing but a toy now.
Best to leave him here.
Believe me, I had nothing whatsoever to do about this.
You know my dear, I can't recall a time when you were so silent for so long.
Let's go, old man.
NEWS ANCHOR (ON TV): And Mrs.
Santa Claus has positively identified the kidnappers as Martians.
Never in the history of mankind have the nations of the world reacted with such unanimity and cooperation.
Tonight the lights will burn until dawn in the United
Nations building as the leaders of the world a map of course of action.
And at Cape Kennedy, our correspondent interviewed
[INAUDIBLE] Von Green, the man in charge of
America's Starshot program.
CORRESPONDENT (VOICEOVER):
Mr. Von Green, what is the space agency doing about this?
VON GREEN (ON TV): Well, they have mobilized all the men and equipment in our
Starshot project.
And we have rushed our astronauts into an intensive program for the final phase of their training.
Now, our Starshot ship is supposed undergo six months of test flights.
But we are going to forget about the testing and go after those
Martian monkeys.
CORRESPONDENT (VOICEOVER):
Isn't that risky?
VON GREEN (ON TV): Of course it is risky.
But every one of our astronauts is begging for the chance to go after the Martians.
Who wouldn't give everything to bring
Santa back to our children?
Earth hasn't reacted yet.
No radar beams being bounced off our ship.
Looks like we made a clean getaway.
[LAUGHING]
How's our captive?
He's having the time of his life.
He's such a funny little man.
Why, I've only been with him for five minutes, and he has me laughing just like an Earthling.
What's soft, and round, and you put it on a stick, and... and you toast it in a fire, and it's green?
I don't know, what?
A Martian-mallow.
That's what you're all becoming... Martian-mallows.
Soft.
Weak.
That old man is a menace.
Gee, Santa, it's all our fault.
We told them where to find you.
Oh, balderdash and a fiddle-dee-dee, Billy boy.
Everybody knows where Santa lives.
Besides, I've always wanted to visit Mars.
Mommy and Daddy are going to be angry.
You think that's something?
I can just see Mrs. Claus now.
Christmas coming, and I'm not there.
She'll have a fit.
Oh me oh my oh me.
Come and get it.
Dinner time.
Here's Dropo.
If I can't cheer you up, Dropo can.
He always makes me laugh.
Oh, you'll have a wonderful dinner tonight.
Oh, there's soup, and beef stew, and chocolate ice cream.
No thank you, Dropo.
I'm not hungry.
Come on, Billy.
Oh.
Well, is it all right if I have your chocolate ice cream?
Sure.
Oh, I just love chocolate ice cream.
Kimar, look at this.
That small blip is not an asteroid.
It's a spaceship, and it's on our tail, getting closer.
Impossible, Rigna.
They couldn't have spotted us.
We have our radar shield on.
I know that sir, but they are gaining on us.
Is it possible Earth has a secret device that can penetrate our radar shield?
They have a secret device, and his name is Billy Foster.
I warned you that these
Earthlings are dangerous.
They'll destroy us if we allow them.
Well I won't allow them.
I think we underestimate the resourcefulness of these Earth people.
Very clever of the boy.
Make the repairs, Rigna.
I'll take evasive action.
Well.
And how is Santa, and the little Earthlings.
My, it must be tiresome cooped up in this little room.
Say, how would you like to see the rest of the ship?
You're not fooling me.
You don't like us.
You're mean.
Oh, come on now.
That's not true.
Why, Santa makes everyone feel good, even me.
I don't trust you.
Now, now, Billy boy.
That's not the Christmas spirit.
Why, of course, Voldar.
We'd love to take the grand tour.
All right, children.
This room is called...
Airlock.
That's right.
Sure.
This is where you come when you're ready to go out in space.
It's airtight.
You put on your space suit, and go out through that door.
When you come back, the door closes, and they pump air back into the room through there.
When it reaches the pressure of the rest of the ship, you can take your space suit off.
Smart lad.
Well, where's the control that opens the door [INAUDIBLE]?
Not here.
That's in the control deck.
You see, once you pull that switch, the warning bell sounds, and in 60 seconds, that door opens.
Santa, that clock stopped.
60 seconds.
That must be the door timer.
Santa, he locked us in.
Oh, I don't think so.
He probably just stepped out for a moment.
It's locked.
I don't trust Voldar.
He's not like Kimar and the others.
I don't like him.
I'm worried, Santa.
Now, now, children, let's not get excited.
It's Voldar.
He's going to open the space door.
Help, Kimar!
Kimar!
Help!
Gee, Santa, what are we going to do?
Once that door opens, we haven't got a chance.
Eh.
Where'd you say this leads to, Billy?
VOLDAR: Seven six, five, four, three, two, one, zero.
Who's in the airlock?
No one, now.
What's going on, Voldar?
Oh, Chief, Santa and the children are missing.
Where are they?
Drifting around in space, along with the rest of the space junk.
Before I'm through with you, Voldar, you'll wish you were floating around out there in space.
[LAUGHING]
Merry Christmas, everyone.
Santa Claus, you're all right.
I... I thought you were...
Well, when Voldar accidentally left in the airlock, and then came up here and accidentally threw the door switch, we knew we had to get out of there in a hurry, or that would be the end of us...
Eh, accidentally, of course.
So we crawled up through the air duct.
The air duct.
But the air duct is just a little, and... and you're so big.
[LAUGHING]
Well, you're talking to Santa Claus, son.
KIMAR: But, how...
Well, well now, you wouldn't want me to tell my secret, would you?
[LAUGHING]
Oh... oh, oh, poor man.
He's fainted, just like someone who's seen a ghost.
KIMAR: Begin landing operation.
CREW: (SINGING) Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way.
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh.
Uh, Merry Christmas, Voldar.
[MUFFLED SQUEAKING]
All right, on your feet, come on.
Dropo!
Oh, whoa... I was handing him food pills through the bars, and he grabbed my wrists...
Shut up, Dropo.
Kimar, come in quickly.
Kimar?
Yes, Rigna?
RIGNA (ON INTERCOM):
Voldar has escaped.
What?
He's gone.
KIMAR (ON INTERCOM): That can only mean trouble.
Put a constant guard on
Santa and the Earth children.
Voldar will be back.
Oh, Kimar.
Are you alone?
No.
MOMAR: Well.
KIMAR: Earthlings...
Billy and Betty.
Welcome to our home.
There's someone else, too.
Oh?
Come on.
Come on in.
Lady Momar.
I'm not accustomed to entering people's homes through the door, but you have no chimney.
Welcome, Santa Claus.
We hope you'll make the children on Mars very happy.
I'll try, dear lady.
I'll try.
Where are they?
KIMAR: Well, we'll start with my youngsters.
How are they, Momar?
MOMAR: The same.
Quiet, remote, and very unhappy.
They're inside, studying.
Well, let old Santa say hello to them.
And I'm sure these children would like to meet them.
I'll tell them you're here.
COMPUTER: Y over 5 pi r squared to determine the correct orbit from Mars to Jupiter, traveling along Vector
A through the 17th quadrant at the power of 12 megatrons.
Father!
Father, we missed you.
I missed you, too.
Children, I brought some visitors from Earth.
Will you come in please, children?
Billy and Betty, this is Bomar and Girmar.
Hi.
There's nothing in it.
What are you giving me?
My hand, to shake.
How old are you?
I'm 10, too.
And Girmar's eight.
So is my sister.
We have another Earth person that wants to see you.
What's that?
They're laughing.
Bomar and Girmar, too.
They've never laughed before.
Come.
I can't believe it.
That's the first time in months they've gone to sleep without the sleep spray.
Santa, tomorrow we'll set up a workshop for you.
It won't be exactly the same as the one you have on Earth, but I'm sure it'll serve your purpose.
Good, good.
Now, I'd like to get going and have the toy shop operating full blast, so as I can return to Earth for Christmas.
You know, Mrs. Claus is a very good-natured woman, but...
Santa Claus, you will never return to Earth.
Wha...
Now you belong to Mars.
Ho, ho, ho.
Well, we've no time to lose.
We must go into action.
Now we cannot eliminate Santa Claus, but we can just discredit him, make him a laughingstock throughout Mars.
Come on.
Now listen, carefully.
That workshop closes at 10 o'clock.
The guards will be at Kimar's house, guarding Santa Claus.
Now this is what we'll do, see?
You take...
Two dolls.
Two dolls.
Yes, Betty.
BETTY: Three baseball bats.
Three baseball bats.
Look at me, Santa Claus, the great toymaker, pressing buttons.
That's automation for you.
Technology, oi.
Well, that's enough for today.
Let's close up shop!
OK, Santa.
OK, Santa.
Boy, we sure did a lot today.
SANTA CLAUS: Yes, well, there's another day gone, children.
As they say on Earth, another day, another dollar.
Well, hello, Santa.
How are you feeling today?
Tired?
No, no.
I'm not tired.
But my finger is.
It's been pressing buttons all day long.
Well, I think I'll go in and put my finger to bed.
Here, children.
Here's your milk.
You can play for half an hour, and then you'll have to go to bed.
Daddy, may we watch the Earth program?
Certainly, dear.
But only for half an hour.
Billy?
Betty?
Don't you want to watch the Earth programs?
Oh, no sir.
We're not interested in Earth programs.
I'm going to sleep.
Goodnight.
Me, too.
Just a moment.
Goodnight, Mr. Kimar.
Goodnight, Lady Momar.
Just a moment, children.
Are you feeling well?
Oh, we feel fine, sir.
Goodnight.
Goodnight.
KIMAR: Has someone been mistreating you?
Oh, no sir.
You and Lady Momar have just been swell to us.
Goodnight.
What could it be, Momar?
They're behaving the way our children used to behave.
Can't you tell, Kimar?
They're homesick.
They miss their parents, their friends.
Kimar, you've got to send those children back.
Impossible.
Oh, now I'm Santa Claus.
Ho, ho, ho.
Ho, ho, ho.
Merry Christmas everyone!
Ho, ho, ho.
My finger isn't tired.
I think I'll go down to the workshop and make some more toys.
Ho, ho, ho. (SINGING)
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way.
[HUMMING]
VOLDAR: Shim, pull the light.
No, the light.
Oh, ah, this is going shake 'em up.
These toys will never be the same again.
Shh!
Shh!
Shh!
Someone's coming.
Quick, down.
(SINGING) Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way.
Oh what fun it is to ride the one horse open sleigh, hey.
What a break.
It's Santa Claus.
He's alone.
No guards.
(SINGING) Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way.
Oh what fun it is to ride... oh, oh, oh.
Now stay put, my fat little friend.
Hey, Santa.
How do you like this toy?
Ho, ho, ho.
My friend asked you a question.
Answer him.
Ho, ho, ho.
Quiet, Shim.
Put on a nuclear curtain.
Tomorrow marks the end of Operation Santa Claus.
And Mars returns to normal.
Dropo, we're here.
He's hiding, Santa.
Oh, playing hide and seek, eh?
All right, Dropo.
Here we come, ready or not.
He's not here, Santa.
That's funny.
Oh, well, he'll turn up.
Let's get started.
Hey, ho!
Ready?
OK.
Let's go.
One teddy bear and one doll.
One teddy bear and one doll.
Santa, stop the machine!
Look!
The doll has a teddy bear's head, and the teddy bear has a doll's head.
I can't understand it.
Oh, let's try it again.
What's next, Betty?
One baseball bat.
SANTA CLAUS: A baseball tennis...
Why, this will never do.
The machine isn't working right.
Oh, dear.
What else, Betty?
A toy train.
A toy train.
Well, all right.
Yes.
Look at that.
Wha... Why, this doesn't make sense.
Well, this never happened when we made toys by hand.
Something very strange is happening here.
Bomar, I think you'd better call your father.
Father?
Father, this is Bomar.
KIMAR (ON INTERCOM): Yes, Bomar?
Father, we're in the toy shop.
Dropo was in here, and there's something wrong with the toy machine, too.
KIMAR (ON INTERCOM):
I'll be right over.
Just a word of warning.
If you got any big ideas, forget them.
If you walk through that nuclear curtain, you'll be disintegrated like that.
Sabotage Somebody switched all our wiring.
Dropo's gone.
Your suit is missing.
And now, this machine's been sabotaged.
Put them all together, it spells Voldar.
He was here, and he thought Dropo was me.
He's got Dropo.
And I've got to find him.
Poor Dropo.
Surprised to see us?
You're under arrest, Voldar.
Stop playing with toys.
Put it away, Kimar.
We have a weapon that's much more potent than that.
As you may know, we are holding Santa Claus a hostage.
One false move, and your little ho, ho, ho man will be destroyed.
All right.
What do you want, Voldar?
These are our terms.
First, destroy the toy machine.
Second, we will release Santa Claus if you promise to send him and the Earthlings back to their planet.
Third, no more joy through toys nonsense on Mars.
Well?
Well, you win.
Are you sure you have Santa Claus?
VOLDAR: You know we have him.
You mean you had him.
How did he get out of the cave?
Shim, that idiot!
A-a-and how'd he get here s-s-so fast?
Santa Claus has powers that you don't know about.
All right.
Arms up.
Rigna, Hargo, Lomas, report.
RIGNA (ON INTERCOM):
This is Rigna, Kimar.
Hargo and Lomas are with me.
Good.
I've got Voldar and Stobo.
I'll keep them here in the storeroom of the toy shop.
Rigna, you come here and take them off my hands.
I want Hargo and Lomas to look for a man named Shim.
Tell them to search the caves along the Transverse Canal.
RIGNA (ON INTERCOM):
Right, Kimar.
All right, you two.
In there.
All right, you might as well relax.
You're going to be here for a while.
Sit down.
SHIM: Where are you going?
Ho, ho, ho.
Can't you say anything else but ho, ho, ho?
DROPO: Ho, ho, ho.
If you're thinking of leaving,
Santa, let me remind you.
Once you hit that nuclear curtain, there won't even be a whisker left.
Ho, ho, ho.
SHIM: Hey, Santa!
Be careful!
What are you going to do with us?
You're going to stand trial before the council.
I don't think you'll be causing any more trouble.
Well now, I think that should do it, Billy boy.
Close the door, son.
Now, I think we need a little red paint.
And you'll find it in the storeroom.
Sure, Santa.
Yes.
That's a good boy.
VOLDAR: This time I'll take care of Santa Claus for good, and smash that machine.
Santa!
Santa!
Voldar and the other man are in the storeroom, and they're coming to get you.
Oh, they are, are they?
Yeh... well, maybe they'd like to have some fun with our toys, and we'll see that they do.
Won't we kids.
Oh-ho, we meet again, eh?
I don't know how you escaped
Shim, but you won't escape me.
You're through.
Voldar, why don't you, uh, relax?
You're going to relax... permanently.
You?
Wha... but, you're not here.
You're in there.
Oh, yeah, you're right.
I'm not here.
I'm in there.
Wait a minute.
I'm going to see who
Voldar's fighting in there.
What happened?
I don't know what's going on in there, but I'm going to take care of you myself.
Now... now, just a minute.
Now I'd like to talk to... Oh, boy,
Chief, am I glad to see you.
All right, inside, Stobo.
All right, kids, you can stop now.
I said cease fire.
All right, Rigna.
Take them away.
They've had a rough day.
Ho, ho, ho, everybody.
Merry Christmas!
You don't need me here, Kimar.
You've got a wonderful
Santa Claus of your own.
Ho, ho, ho!
Goodbye, Billy.
Goodbye.
Goodbye, Betty dear.
You take care of yourself.
Bye.
I've got something for you, Billy.
Gee, thanks.
Goodbye.
Bye.
Gee, we had fun.
We're going to miss you.
Do you think we'll ever meet again?
I'm sure you will, children.
Thank you, Santa, for bringing happiness to the children of Mars.
And the Christmas spirit to all of us.
Son, from the bottom of my heart,
I wish you and yours the very best of everything.
Ho, ho, ho!
Merry Christmas, everybody!
Dropo Claus is here.
Ho, ho, ho, Merry Christmas!
Dropo, you put on weight.
Oh, yes.
No pillows, look.
Look kids, no pillows.
Now, if we hurry, we can get back in time for Christmas Eve.
KIDS: Yay!
Shall we get going?
KIDS: Yay!
Goodbye, dear friends.
Away!
Merry Christmas, everyone!
Away!
MARTIANS: Bye!
Goodbye, Santa Claus!
Goodbye!
[MUSIC - "HOORAY FOR SANTA
CLAUS"]
Energy takes on many forms.
Example. What do we know of acoustical energy?
It was discovered by a famous scientist, right? Wrong.
We must give credit to an Italian who one night was singing an aria in a Milano pizza parlor.
You know the story.
How he hit a high note and the sound waves shattered a glass on the other side of the room?
Watch me, and I will show you acoustical energy at work.
Now, your next assignment will be...
Oh, I forgot.
There'll be no assignment.
See you next week.
Here we are.
The beginning of the end.
Point of no return.
The last mile.
Now, Shelby.
All right.
"Of all sad words of tongue and pen, the saddest are these.
"It might have been."
Shelby, you promised.
Now stop.
Did I promise to stop loving you?
Open the door and let me out.
Suppose he doesn't show up this time.
Oh, Reverend, how nice to see you.
You must be getting tired of my wedding.
Third time's the charm, they say.
But I am glad that this time you brought the bridegroom with you.
At last we meet,
Professor Brainard.
No, this is Professor Ashton.
He's Romance Languages.
Professor Brainard is Physical Chemistry.
Oh, dear me, I seem to have made a mistake.
Not you, sir.
It's Miss Carlisle's mistake.
I've just been trying to talk her out of this blunder.
Shelby, you are speaking of the man I love.
Love, darling, is a bouquet of fragrant hyacinths.
Not a beaker of hydrogen.
Am I right, sir?
I merely perform the service.
I don't take sides.
Betsy!
Well, well, here comes the bride.
- Reverend.
- Good evening, sir.
Professor Ashton from Rutland University.
Aren't you on the wrong campus?
Miss Carlisle invited me.
Yes, yes, I remember.
There was talk that you were a contender for Betsy's hand.
Rutland can't win them all.
Oh, it was so sweet of you to go to all this trouble.
And for the third time, too.
Well, you know, third time's the charm.
That's exactly what I just said.
I'm sick of having a spinster for a secretary.
I better change.
The guests will be coming soon.
The bridegroom, too, I hope.
I've alerted his housekeeper.
She'll see that he gets here.
# The ring is in
your right-side pocket #
Professor!
Professor Brainard!
# Square root of "E" minus "C,"
alpha "G" #
No.
No, don't stop.
Don't stop.
Keep going.
Keep going.
Please don't stop.
Oh, not again.
Professor?
# Bum bum-bum-bum #
Time for you to get dressed.
Just five more minutes,
Mrs. Chatsworth.
Professor, well, heavens, what are you doing?
I'm trying to solve the secrets of the universe.
And failing.
Failing miserably.
You're stopping.
Do you know what time it is?
You've been working all afternoon.
Mrs. Chatsworth, I've been working for three months.
Pardon me.
I've been working on something very important.
More important, I suppose, than getting married?
Oh! Mrs. Chatsworth, I don't know what I'd do without you.
Oh, you're getting a wonderful girl.
If you ask me, she's too good for you.
Thanks, Mrs. Chatsworth.
I love you, too.
Don't worry about a thing.
I'll be in in the morning to feed the dog.
- What's the matter with me?
- Is anything wrong?
What a lunkhead. Instead of minus, it should be plus.
So, the molecular configuration of "A"...
...is almost the same as that of "B."
Therefore, if I don't worry about "A" throwing off free hydrogen, it could stand a few degrees more centigrade.
Remember, I promised that sweet girl I'd have you there on time.
Yes, Mrs. Chatsworth.
And, Professor, may I say happy honeymoon?
You certainly may,
Mrs. Chatsworth.
And the same to you.
Miscalculation has been staring me in the face for weeks.
Can't see the forest for the trees.
Right, Charlie?
All right, Charlie.
Cross your fingers.
Now. Good.
Good.
Very good.
182. That's good.
Yes.
Yes.
Now we're cooking, Charlie!
We may be in business yet!
It's just awful.
Poor darling.
What ails the man?
Missing his own wedding three times.
He might still show up.
You know the old saying.
Third time's the charm.
I say three strikes and you're out!
Thank you all for coming.
I'll return your presents.
I hope you can get your money back.
I'm sorry.
After all the trouble you've gone to.
I'll be at the office at the usual time in the morning.
I want to go on as if nothing has happened.
Shelby, I don't seem to have an escort.
Would you mind waiting?
I'm yours to command.
Oh, Betsy.
Oh, hello, Charlie.
Go back to bed now.
Let's go back to sleep, hmm?
What happened?
What happened?
Well, that's the end of that.
Get away, Charlie.
Get away, Charlie.
I'm not sure what we've got here, Charlie, but if we've got what I think we've got, we've got something.
There's one way to find out.
Ready?
Yes!
Yes, Charlie!
We've got it!
Do you see?
It's not going lower and lower.
It's going higher and higher.
You know what that means?
It means just one thing.
It's generating its own energy.
You know what that means,
Charlie?
It means we've discovered a new kind of energy!
A new kind of energy, Charlie.
It's a breakthrough!
A breakthrough, Charlie!
Discovered. Substance "X."
In appearance, subscribes to classical requirements of metastable compound, but whose behavior is distinctly nonclassical.
Hypothesis. The application of an external force triggers a molecular change, liberating energy of a type previously unknown.
I suppose you think these are just rubber balls.
Or maybe a flying rubber ball.
But you know what this really is?
Of course you don't.
We just discovered it.
We've got to give it a name.
Let's see.
Flying rubber.
Flying rubber.
Flubber?
All right.
Substance "X."
We dub thee "Flubber."
If Flubber's going to be of any use, we've got to control it, right?
So, you take an ordinary radioactive isotope.
Now a sliding shutter to let the right amount of gamma rays through to bombard the Flubber.
Now, we put it under here so that we can bombard the Flubber with gamma rays to trigger the molecular change.
Which is more scientific than kicking it or bouncing it around the room.
All right.
Here we go.
Eureka!
It works.
Perfect control.
Now we ease off on the gamma rays.
And back to Earth.
Light as a daisy.
Just as I thought.
Just as I thought, Charlie.
Weight makes absolutely no difference.
Just shoot up a few extra gamma rays.
Isn't that wonderful,
Charlie?
Professor!
Are you still here?
What about the wedding?
I can still make it.
It's 5 minutes to 8:00.
Yes, 5 minutes to 8:00.
In the morning.
In the morning?
No.
No, I didn't do it again.
I got to go and see Betsy and tell her what happened.
I know what you're thinking.
But don't you worry.
Everything's gonna be all right.
When I tell Betsy what I've done, she's gonna be happy.
Oh. Mrs. Chatsworth.
Don't you tell a soul, but I've discovered Flubber.
That poor, poor girl.
Are you sure it was wise to come in today?
I'm perfectly all right.
Mr. Alonzo Hawk, president of the Auld Lang Syne loan company, et cetera, et cetera.
My dear Mr. Hawk...
During the past few days,
I have been disturbed by rumors that you plan to take our campus and construct a housing tract thereon.
Oh, surely he wouldn't.
Not even Mr. Hawk.
Let's hope not, my dear.
The situation requires delicate handling.
But he's an alumnus.
My dear girl, our esteemed alumnus made an extremely large loan to the college.
That loan is overdue, and Mr. Hawk has us, if you'll forgive a pertinent expression, over a barrel.
However, my dear Mr. Hawk,
I am quite confident that I can demonstrate how an extension of your loan would be in the best interest to all of us.
I'd like to suggest a meeting at the earliest opportunity that would be convenient to you.
I shall make myself available.
Psst!
However, Mr. Hawk...
Don't be angry. I'm sorry
I missed the wedding again.
Look, I couldn't help it.
Of your loan is in all our best interests.
Go.
Get out of here.
Don't want to see you.
I was working in the laboratory and had an explosion.
Go.
Get out of here.
I do not want to see you.
I hit my head.
I fell on the floor.
I was knocked out.
Knocked out.
I know your heart is with us.
Go. Get out.
Look, the most wonderful thing happened.
Wait till you hear.
Look.
Flubber.
I shall make myself available at any time.
Flubber. Flubber.
...of the greatest importance.
No, make that "of the most supreme importance."
Flubber.
Flubber. Flubber.
Flubber. Flubber.
Flubber. Watch.
Oh. Good morning, sir.
I'd like to speak to
Miss Carlisle, if I may.
Betsy, I... Oh, sir,
I just wanted to tell her that I'm sorry
I missed the wedding.
I have the most wonderful thing to tell you.
The most wonderful thing you can tell me is "goodbye."
In which I heartily concur.
This way.
Just a minute.
If you'd give me a chance, she'd forgive me.
Anything you say would be superfluous.
Kindly take your ball and go.
Daggett!
Why, Mr. Hawk.
What a pleasant surprise.
I want a word with you.
I, too, have been wanting to chat about our loan.
- That'll be all, Brainard.
- Brainard!
Is this the one you call "Neddy the Nut"?
Yeah, that's right, Pop.
Do you know that this man flunked my boy?
No, Mr. Hawk.
I welcome this opportunity.
If the teacher and the parent of the backward student...
Backward?
May I remind you it was Hawk brains that founded this town?
Hawk brains that built it?
And you have the gall to say that my boy, who proudly bears the name of Hawk, is backward?
I'd just as soon forget...
Will you shut up when I talk?
I wish I could show you his examination paper.
Not only did he miss every answer, he misspelled the name of the college.
Do you mind?
I'd like to discuss the matter alone with Mr. Hawk.
This means my boy can't play in the big game tonight against Rutland.
Where's your school spirit?
Flunking your star player.
I don't think this is a place to lend a half a million dollars.
We have principles here at Medfield.
I offered to help Biff.
A makeup exam.
But he couldn't be bothered.
So he's ineligible.
None of your vague promises about lending money is going to change that.
Mr. Hawk has already loaned the money. The school is grateful.
Professor, I rejoice in your sense of ethics.
But do you mind terribly if I speak for myself?
- Mr. Hawk.
- Hold it.
I came to have my say, and I've said it.
Mr. Hawk, a moment of your time.
I'd like to discuss our loan.
You'd like to discuss our loan?
Well, I have an office downtown for that!
And you might bring some of those principles of yours and see how much they're worth in cold cash!
Come on, Biffer.
Get me the file on wealthy alumni marked "emergency."
- We have some letters to write.
- Yes, sir.
You've got to let me explain.
Then you'll understand why I missed the wedding.
All right, go ahead.
I'd like that.
For once I would really like to understand.
Like most things that seem complicated, it was actually quite simple.
I was thinking in terms of magnetic energy, when what I was after was repulsive energy.
Silly. But you know how you get carried away.
Yes. I know.
If not for this explosion,
I might never have found it.
The application of thermal energy to two incompatible metastable compounds brought about fusion, the release of explosive gases, and a residue.
Do you know what that residue was?
No.
Flubber.
Flubber!
Well, it's been thrilling.
Now, if you'll excuse me.
Betsy, never in my wildest dreams did I hope to find a compound whose configuration is such that the delivery of energy to its surface would trigger a change in the configuration.
This change liberates enormous quantities of energy.
But they act in a direction opposite that of the force which triggered the change.
We call it repulsive energy.
That's just the way I feel.
Yet strangely enough, the total effect is transient.
Upon the shutting off of the energy, the elemental particles return to pseudo-equilibrium.
- Isn't that wonderful?
- Yes!
Now that I clearly understand what happened to my wedding, will you excuse me?
President Daggett and I have some important work.
Such as, I hope, saving the college.
But, Betsy, don't you see?
This can save the college.
It could be worth millions.
Do me a personal favor.
Go bounce your ball somewhere else.
We'll talk it out tonight.
I'll pick you up for the game.
Well, I guess we shook them up a little.
Nobody's gonna push us around.
You're kidding, aren't you?
About closing the college and turning the grounds into a housing tract?
I'm gonna teach you some facts of life.
Small college. Like the small country store, little drugstore.
They're all in the same boat.
They're sinking.
Today is the day of the supermarkets, the supercolleges.
The little man is gonna get squashed.
But you graduated from Medfield.
It's your college.
So what do you want?
Some total stranger to close it down?
Or some loyal, friendly alumnus to take care of things?
Isn't there something you could do?
Give them some more time on the loan or something.
I'm sentimental about
Medfield just like you.
But it's like shooting a horse that has a broken leg.
I want to do it to put it out of its misery.
Now, if I happen to make a few extra bucks, well, that's just something you're going to have to learn to accept.
Yes, sir.
Oh, about the game.
Has word gotten around that you're not playing?
Not that I know of.
Not yet.
Say, Lenny, see what the point spread is on the Medfield-Rutland game tonight.
How much you want to go for?
Whatever the traffic will bear.
8,000 or 10,000 bucks.
You're not betting on Medfield.
Without me on the team, we'll get murdered.
Who said I'm betting on Medfield?
You're not betting against us?
Son, we have access to some very valuable information about that game tonight.
There's a saying.
"It's an ill wind that doesn't blow a few bucks into the coffers of the
Auld Lang Syne loan company."
Get the point?
When we pull down the spark lever, this shutter opens and releases the gamma rays.
Up goes the Flubber and the car.
We pull the gas lever, this shutter opens, and the car goes.
We press on the brake, this opens, and the rays bring the car to a stop.
If we open the shutter farther, the car goes in reverse.
Charlie, suppose we get a little tired of just going straight ahead.
So we turn the wheel to the right, and we bank to the right.
Turn the wheel to the left, and we bank to the left.
Well, that's about it,
Charlie.
The important thing is nobody finds out.
Except Betsy, of course.
So people don't ask questions, we'll put this under the hood so it'll sound like a Model T.
That ought to do it, Charlie.
Now all they'll say is,
"Professor, see you finally got that old collector's item in running order."
All right, Charlie.
We're all set.
All clear, Charlie.
Now we'll get your safety belt.
Now this side.
Good dog.
Now... sound on.
Lights on.
And gas lever down.
Hang onto your hat, Charlie.
It handles beautifully, Charlie.
We don't need these up here, do we?
There. That's better.
Now watch this, Charlie.
Not bad, Charlie.
Let's open her up and see what she'll really do.
Yoo-hoo!
Well, look what we got down there.
Look out, girls.
Here we come.
Look out, Charlie!
Gonna have to watch where I'm going, huh?
Yeah.
Charlie, I've got an idea.
Why don't we fly over and drop in on that certain someone?
# Do-do do-do #
# Do-do-do do-do #
# That lovely, adorable
Betsy of mine #
# Oh, won't she be happy,
sweet Betsy of mine #
# When we take her flying,
that Betsy of mine #
# She'll hug me and tell me
she's not really sore #
# That lovely, adorable
Betsy of mine #
Can you imagine what she'll say when she sees this?
- Was there something you wanted?
- Yes.
I'd like to speak to
Miss Carlisle if you don't mind.
I'm afraid I do, old man.
Miss Carlisle and I are leaving for the game.
- Ready, dear?
- Yes, Shelby.
- Before you go...
- Excuse us.
Betsy, please come here.
If you don't mind.
I have the most wonderful thing.
Ned, I am trying not to be angry.
Please, don't make a scene.
Haven't you caused Miss Carlisle enough embarrassment?
Betsy, it's a surprise.
It's a sort of wedding present.
Just what every girl dreams about.
It's not the car, Betsy.
It's what's inside the car.
I can't show it with him around.
Now, would you excuse us?
Betsy!
Betsy, you know what
I was telling you about this morning in the office about my discovery?
I want to show you what I've done with it.
I want you to take one ride around the block.
Just one little ride, Betsy.
How'd it go?
All the loot's down.
But I had to give them 6 to 1.
Get back on the phone.
See if you can find any more of that kind of money.
I'm afraid it isn't
Medfield's night.
My dear, victory isn't everything.
"To love the game beyond the prize, to honor while you strike him down, the foe that comes with fearless eyes."
Excuse me.
- Oh. Professor.
Pardon me, please.
Late as usual, I see.
Come on, Medfield!
Hate to see you betting against our team.
This isn't betting.
This is like making it in the cellar.
Oh, if Biff Hawk were only playing tonight.
Yes, yes.
I heard he was ineligible.
Now, I wonder who could've flunked your star player.
We're much more realistic about things like that at Rutland.
I understand you pay your players more than you do your teachers.
That's ridiculous.
I get twice as much as...
I really don't care to discuss it.
Our poor boys.
They try so hard!
I feel sorry for people who don't know when they're beaten.
Don't you, Professor?
Now, Shelby, please don't start anything!
Why doesn't he go down and sit in the Rutland section?
I'm sorry.
It's not fair!
Our team can't even reach the ball!
Yes, poor little chaps.
I'd say they need some kind of a lift.
Why don't they try elevator heels?
Very funny.
Elevator heels.
Pardon me.
Would you pardon me, please?
There's more than one way to skin a cat.
She won't ride in my car with me? Okay.
She won't listen to me.
Okay.
So we're gonna surprise her, Charlie.
More than that, we're gonna Flubberghast her.
Boys, what can I say?
I'm proud of you.
They're murdering us.
But I'm proud of you.
Remember, you're like sons to me.
All of you.
How do you think I feel?
Do you think it's easy sitting, watching you guys getting your ears pinned back?
Well, let me tell you this.
I've coached a lot of teams in my day, but I've never seen harder-fighting boys than you boys right here.
You got heart.
I mean, real heart.
Coach, do we really have to go back out there?
Look, I know how you feel, son.
But remember this.
A team that won't be beaten...
Well, Professor!
Oh, hello, Coach.
Something the matter?
Maybe something on your conscience?
No. I just dropped by to see if there's anything I can do.
I am sorry I had to flunk
Biff. If that's what you mean.
It's a little late for apologies, don't you think?
One minute, Coach.
All right.
Get ready.
Starting lineup same as the first half.
Too bad Biff didn't keep his grades up.
That's one of those things.
Just remember, one man doesn't make a team.
And I tell you, you can go out and beat Rutland.
You can win this game.
Sure we can.
Yes, you can.
Because I know something about you that you don't know.
They're twice as big, but that doesn't make any difference now.
They could be 10 feet tall.
We could still beat them.
Yes. We could.
You can beat Rutland if you give it all the drive and the bounce you've got.
Remember that word "bounce."
Bounce.
And when you bounce, remember this.
No matter how much you put in, you're going to get twice as much out of it.
Now, get out there, fellows, and hop to it!
Say, what's going on out there?
- What got into 'em?
- I don't know!
Maybe it was that pep talk
Brainard gave them!
- What did he say?
- I wish I could remember!
Go, Medford! Go!
Will you listen to me?
There's something fishy going on!
All right. What?
You tell me!
Well, how do I know?
Something!
What am I supposed to do?
There's nothing that says one team can't jump higher than the other!
Time's up! Let's go!
Gosh, Pop. Look at them go!
Look-it!
I'm looking!
Come on, Medfield!
Come on, team!
Come on, Medfield!
Come on, team!
Look at them go!
Aren't they terrific?
Sorry, Pop.
I forgot.
Come on, team!
Hey, what do you know?
Lenny just laid off
5 G's against Medfield.
Against Medfield?
Oh, thank you so much!
You meathead!
Don't you know what's going on out there?
Shoot, Harper! Shoot!
Go! Go!
We did it!
Sure, we did it!
I did it because you wouldn't listen.
What do you mean you did it?
You saw the way the boys played.
The reason they could play like that is my discovery.
Surely you're not taking credit for Medfield winning?
In a way, yes.
Now I've heard everything.
To watch those boys out there fighting, playing their hearts out, and to hear you taking the bows for it.
I didn't mean it...
Pretty small, Brainard.
That's all I can say.
Pretty small.
- Come on. Let's go.
- Now, Betsy.
Betsy, wait a minute.
Shelby, please give me time to think.
Of course, darling.
You can give me your answer tomorrow night after the dance.
I think I know what it will be.
Good night, my love.
Good night, Shelby.
You probably thought of me as a kindly, level-headed professor.
Well, now you see what a woman can do to you.
I'm a desperate man.
Desperate men do desperate things.
Lights off.
Sound off.
And up we go.
Officer! Officer!
Officer, help me!
It's after me! Help me!
I do hope that you will excuse my appearance.
But I was just having a cup of boiling-hot coffee.
- But it's after me!
- What's after you?
I don't know.
Some kind of a thing!
A thing?
Can you describe it?
No, I didn't see it.
But it flies.
And it made a noise.
Like aaoooga! Aaooga!
Then it banged down on the top of my car.
Voom! Voom!
And when I looked, there wasn't anything!
Ohhhh.
That kind of a thing.
Suppose you blow into this thing.
We'll see if we can find where it came from.
Do something!
It's probably lurking in the dark, ready to spring!
Go on!
Don't worry.
We won't let it get you.
Now, come on, blow, okay?
This is outrageous!
I happen to be Professor Ashton, head of the English department at Rutland!
And a very important person there!
In that case, this ought to be easy for an English teacher.
Can you say "Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers"?
Have you gone mad?
Or perhaps you'd prefer
"Round the rugged rock the ragged rascal ran."
I'll say no such idiotic thing!
We are not being very cooperative, now, are we?
Come on. Blow into this.
We'd appreciate it.
I'll do no such thing!
Blow.
Blow!
Having trouble, Officer Hanson?
No, just the usual.
We always have 502s after the Rutland game.
Uh-huh. I didn't know they were such bad losers.
Brainard, tell these idiots...
Professor, I see you finally got the Model T in working order.
Yeah. It took a little fixing.
But here she is.
Hey...
Sounds like it could use a little valve job in there.
You know how it is with Model T's.
Sometimes you swear they could run without valves.
Or even without a motor!
- Well, so long, Officer.
- So long, Professor.
Brainard!
Tell them who I am!
Now, you told us who you are.
Suppose we all go confide in the sergeant, hmm?
You boys are a big comfort.
I take a bath for $ 15,000, and you can't find what happened!
Maybe they slipped them some new vitamin pill.
If we can grab one of the boys, we could give him a test.
Forget it, will you?
Hi, Pop.
Did you find out anything?
- I sure did.
- What?
It was Neddy the Nut.
The professor?
Well, what did he do?
- He was in the locker room.
- And then?
Gave the boys a pep talk.
Well, what else?
He just talked to them.
Talked to them?
Is that the...
Will you give me that?
Is that the big news you had for me?
Well, is it?
That's about the size of it.
Oh, three cheers for you, sonny.
That's an Earth-shattering bit of information you got there.
Biff! Come here!
Come here!
You see anything?
Just Neddy the Nut flying his old Model T.
Say that again.
Neddy the Nut flying his old Model T!
Yeah!
And that's the genius you were calling a nut!
Oh, yeah. In class, he's been beating our ears about some new kind of energy.
Says he's looking for a breakthrough.
Breakthrough?
Have you any idea what that kind of jazz is worth?
Gentlemen to see you,
Professor.
I can't see anybody now.
What does he want?
Your kind indulgence,
Professor.
Can you find it to forgive this hot-blooded businessman?
Hot-blooded businessman who plans to tear down Medfield?
What do you want?
Wonderful things.
Wonderful things for all of us.
Visualize, if you will, a whole new Medfield College.
10 new buildings
10 stories high.
One building devoted entirely to science.
Two, if you will?
Three?
How does that sound?
It sounds great.
But just where is all this money coming from, Mr. Hawk?
From a certain revolutionary discovery.
What's revolutionary about a Tin Lizzie?
Nothing.
Unless, of course, it happens to fly.
Fly?
Like I happened to see it do last night.
You saw it, huh?
Uh-huh.
Prof, I gotta hand it to you.
Hold it!
Why don't we trust each other?
You're a man of science.
Head in the clouds.
I'm a down-to-Earth, dollar-and-cents man.
My pop always says he can smell a buck...
I'll do the talking, son!
That's a good boy.
There's a million angles.
The government.
The space age!
What they wouldn't give to get their hands on this little Tin Lizzie.
That's where I come in.
When I get through talking with them, they'll come crawling with bags of money.
Barrels of money!
Mr. Hawk, let me get this straight.
You want me to turn my discovery over so you can blackmail our government?
All right, look at it this way.
Medfield College can grow and prosper.
Or it can wither and die on the vine.
That's entirely up to you.
I see. Mr. Hawk, I want to thank you for dropping by.
You've made up my mind.
Now you're talking!
I'm calling the President.
Daggett?
He don't cut any ice.
The President of the United States.
Is that enough ice for you?
Oh, let's not go flying off in all directions.
Just one direction. Out.
Oh, don't get me wrong.
I heartily endorse our government.
All right. You're lowering the boom on Medfield.
But don't you try to come back afterwards.
The iron door is shut!
Well, there goes the ball game.
He'll telephone Washington.
By tomorrow, this place will be swarming with sharpies.
Supposing you did get the professor's discovery.
Did you mean not closing Medfield?
They get that flying jalopy, there's millions down the drain!
If you did, I've got an idea.
- Quiet. I'm trying to think.
- Switch cars.
That idiot Brainard.
If he could've...
What did you say, son?
Switch cars on him.
There are other
Model T's around.
Yeah, there are, aren't there, Biffer?
Fellow in Appleton who's got the same model.
Hold it.
I'm way ahead of you.
Lenny, take the Appleton turnoff.
Hey, you know something?
You're all right, son.
Course, you got a little of your mother in you.
Actually, well, you're just me all over again!
Yes, sir!
You're all right!
I can assure you the President is interested in any development which might have to do with our national welfare.
May I inquire as to the nature of your discovery?
Flubber?
Yes, that does sound significant.
Now, if I only knew which branch of the government might best be served by your discovery?
Any branch.
You name it.
Transportation. Industry.
Agriculture.
Agriculture?
Good.
Oh, don't cut me off.
Agriculture Department.
Sam Wheeler speaking.
Splendid.
Mmm. I see.
How do you figure this can help the farmer?
I don't want to help the farmer.
I want to help everybody!
Don't you understand?
What possibilities do you think this might have as a fertilizer?
Fertilizer?
Don't you people understand how vital this thing is?
It's not only agriculture.
It's industry.
It's national defense.
Oh, national defense.
National defense.
Before we go further,
I just want you to know that I am proud of the new spirit of cooperation between the Army, the Navy, and the Air Force.
Even the newspapers are talking about it.
There never was any difference between us.
Just newspaper guff in the first place.
There's a Professor Brainard on the phone from Medfield.
I don't know any
Professor Brainard.
Tell him to write me.
He might have some connection with Congressman Brainard.
Brainard swings a lot of lead.
He's always been very friendly to us.
Very well.
Hello?
Well, how are you,
Professor?
What can we do for you?
Oh, you have, eh?
Why, that's amazing.
Sort of antigravity.
Well, well.
And you think it's a breakthrough?
Looks like you don't need all that appropriation money.
Got a fellow said he cracked the antigravity problem in his own garage.
Ridiculous.
Another crackpot.
Army's been doing antigravity research for years.
Hasn't come up with anything significant.
Oh, yes.
Yes, Professor.
I'm listening.
Yes, Professor.
Yes, yes.
I realize it's urgent.
So many things are these days.
Oh? You want to come down here to Washington?
Well, now, I don't know about that.
We'd love to see you, of course.
Alert my pilot to standby.
Yes, but we're all busy as bird dogs around here.
I tell you what, Professor.
Why don't you write us a nice, short letter?
Tell us all about it.
Right. And keep up the good work, Professor.
Call us any time.
Oh, better still, we'll call you.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
They won't listen.
Betsy won't listen.
Hawk is the only one that will believe me.
Professor?
Come in, Mrs. Chatsworth.
There you are. Sponged and pressed for the dance tonight.
Thank you. But I won't be going to the dance.
Oh, no. You're not letting that sweet girl go with someone else?
That sweet girl has kicked me out of her life.
What are you gonna do?
Stay home, talk to the dog?
Mrs. Chatsworth, don't turn against me.
Professor, may I say something?
I'd rather you wouldn't.
Not just now.
All right.
Do as you please.
Go with your head in the clouds and your nose poked places it doesn't belong.
Go ahead, like I said.
Unlock the secrets of the universe.
But remember this.
The universe is millions and millions of years old.
It can wait a little.
But girls can't wait.
Mrs. Chatsworth,
I'm not going...
One day, a girl simply says to herself, "That's enough.
I'll just marry the next man that comes along."
And she does.
- Mrs. Chatsworth...
- lf I were in your shoes,
I'd stop that smashing or mashing the atom or whatever it is you're doing, and I'd go to that dance.
Why? Betsy won't even look at me.
Don't they have those numbers where you tap the dancers on the shoulders?
Yes, I suppose.
Well, then, you walk up to that Shelby, tap him on the shoulder, then when he turns.
I'll punch him.
Good.
No, that wouldn't be civilized.
Well, for goodness sake, grab the girl in your arms, hold her tight, and dance her off into the night.
Show him up.
Show up Shelby Ashton?
"The Ballroom Beast"?
He's the best dancer around here.
I dance like a sleepwalking chimpanzee.
But even a chimpanzee will fight for its mate.
I told you he'd turn up here tonight.
# And sink the Army,
sink the Army gray #
Taxi!
You boys get right in.
I'm the only taxi.
I'm pulling right out.
Where to?
Professor Brainard's house.
What are you doing?
Even a chimpanzee fights for his mate.
Aah!
Let me go.
People are looking!
Good.
Let's not disappoint them.
Must have given himself a pep talk.
Maybe you can learn something.
Go, Prof! Go!
We ought to do this more often.
Oh, Ned!
# He flies through the air
with the greatest of ease #
# The daring young man
on the flying trapeze #
I wonder what's going on.
Let's go see.
We've had enough fun for one night.
On second thought, maybe the fun's just beginning!
I beg your pardon.
- Are you from Washington?
- We are.
Are you looking for Professor...
Brainard?
Oh, I'm afraid that's not me.
There's your man.
This is a surprise, your coming all the way from Washington.
Here we are.
Get right in, gentlemen.
Get right in the car, please.
Admiral? General?
Now, I realize that military technology has progressed far beyond the Model T.
- Of course.
- I want you to understand.
I'm using it as a security measure.
What better place to hide my discovery than in a Model T?
I want you to keep in mind that this is only a primitive application of my discovery.
We use this spark lever here to levitate, the gas lever to move forward, and the brake to stop or to go in reverse.
Absolute control at all times, as you will see.
All right, get a good, tight grip on your emotions and prepare for takeoff.
Cool head.
A steady hand.
And up we go!
Well, if at first you don't succeed.
Then what?
Try again.
Well, surely you gentlemen understand this sort of thing.
The first time you tried to launch a rocket, it didn't...
...go up.
It's probably just a short in the control mechanism.
I'm sorry about this delay.
We'll have this in the air in a minute.
This is some kind of a joke.
- I want to see what's in there.
- Just a minute.
Somebody's just playing a practical joke!
I'm not laughing.
Just a minute, gentlemen!
Look, gentlemen, wait.
Please.
Nice going.
That was rich about the squirrel.
A real Hawk touch.
Kind of a mean trick to play.
We're doing him a favor.
You'll see.
Well, I think we've cleared the air on one point.
What's that?
With what's happened,
I'm sure there's no doubt about you and Ned Brainard.
No.
None whatsoever.
As the Bard says,
"That he is mad, 'tis true;
'tis true 'tis pity; and pity 'tis 'tis true."
Oh, shut up!
If that's what she thinks of Shakespeare...
Ned?
If you've come out to gloat,
I can do without that.
I'm not gloating.
I know what you're thinking.
That I'm a fraud. That I'm really losing my marbles.
Are you sure you're all right?
I solemnly swear to you,
I have flown this car.
Oh, don't, darling.
I'll take you home.
- You get a good night's rest.
- Betsy...
Wait a minute.
Why didn't I think to show this to them?
I got so upset when the car wouldn't fly. Here.
Take this.
Now hold it out.
Now drop it.
Flubber!
That's how I was able to bounce around.
That's how we won the game.
This is what makes the car fly.
Are you sure you actually made that car fly?
This very car.
No.
No. I take that back.
Well, did you or didn't you?
This isn't my car, Betsy.
My car had a radio in it.
Somebody switched cars on me.
- Hawk.
- Hawk?
Alonzo Hawk.
He saw me flying the car.
He came to make a deal.
I turned him down.
He stole my car.
Are you sure?
Will you stop saying that?
I'm sure.
Please believe me.
We've got to get that car.
In the hands of Hawk...
I believe you.
If we could figure out some way to...
You what?
I believe you.
You do?
Mm-hmm.
Oh, Betsy.
I'm glad to see you came around to my way of thinking.
I'm with you 100%, Mr. Hawk.
I know. But we were discussing the Model T.
What's with these shoes?
Flubber, Mr. Hawk.
When you wear these shoes, you'll have a spring in your step.
You live life to the fullest.
When the time comes to shuffle off this mortal coil, you won't shuffle.
You'll go out with a hop, a skip, and a song in your heart.
I still don't get it.
What about the Model T?
Well, Mr. Hawk, surely you can see the point.
Why, shoes are 10 times more valuable than a flying car.
- How come?
- Well, figure it out.
Only 8% of the world's population buy cars.
Practically everybody buys shoes.
She's right.
Sure, she's right.
Now, take it easy, Mr. Hawk.
I'll show you how the Flubber works.
Just tap your heel on the floor.
You see?
- Yeah.
- All right.
I don't know if
I can hold my balance.
It just takes a little getting used to.
Why, Ned's crazy about his.
Aren't you, dear?
Yes, I certainly am.
I can't tell you the lift I've gotten.
Now, just jump up and down, Mr. Hawk.
- Up and down?
- Uh-huh.
There we go!
There we go!
Mr. Hawk, I think that's high enough for right now.
Oh, Betsy.
Hold him down!
That's fantastic!
Hold him down, Betsy.
There we are.
Wasn't that wonderful?
- Wonderful. Why did you stop?
- To talk.
We know you're interested in more than money.
- Surely you are.
- I am? What?
Humanity, Mr. Hawk.
You can save lives with these shoes.
Of course you can.
Now, suppose.
Just suppose.
There's a fire.
A raging fire.
The stairs are an inferno.
The smoke is billowing.
We're trapped!
Help! Help! Help!
The flames are creeping closer and closer.
Oh, no, no, no!
I can't stand it any longer!
Geronimo!
My boy!
Nothing to it, Mr. Hawk.
Why, that's amazing!
Your turn, Mr. Hawk.
Oh, now, just a minute.
Oh, it's fun, Mr. Hawk.
Go ahead!
You'll land light as a thistle.
I promise you.
Well, I don't know.
Let me put it this way.
I wouldn't want a partner who doesn't have faith in his product.
You better do it.
He's very fussy about things like that.
Nobody's been able to call me a coward.
I should say not, Mr. Hawk.
Come on down, Mr. Hawk!
One, two...
- I changed my mind.
- Three!
Help!
Whee!
Hey, look!
Look!
I'm doing it!
Sure you are, Mr. Hawk.
Put a little more spring into it.
See how simple it is?
Flex your knees.
That's right.
Look at Mr. Hawk, dear.
Isn't he doing well?
This is marvelous!
Brainard, we've got something here.
Sure we have, Mr. Hawk.
Okay, I'm sold!
Now, how do I stop?
What did he say?
- I can't quite catch it.
- I can't either!
I said, tell me how to stop!
You can tell me something.
What have you done with my car?
You tricked me!
That's right, Mr. Hawk.
Now, where is it?
Where did you hide it?
In my warehouse!
- In his warehouse!
- Thanks, Mr. Hawk!
Hey, how do I stop?
Happy landing, Mr. Hawk!
Wait! Don't go!
Professor Brainard!
Come back!
Don't leave me! Wait!
Don't go! Biff!
Biff, where are you?
It's your father calling!
Huh?
Biff! Son!
Wake up! Get out of bed!
Help your father!
Hey, that's pretty neat, Pop.
How do you do that?
Well, don't just lie there, you nitwit!
Get some somebody!
Get the fire department!
Don't blow a gasket.
Stop me!
Help!
I don't get it.
Why we got to sit around watching that crummy car?
'Cause Hawk says so, that's why.
You figure he knows what he's doing?
Fisheye didn't pile up that loot by being stupid, you know what I mean?
Here I go.
Up we go.
No. I got to go up higher.
No.
There we are.
Looks like people got behind in their payments.
Dear sweet Mr. Hawk.
Shh.
Lenny?
Yeah, what?
Do you hear noises?
Like what kind of noises?
Sort of like a...
...a harp.
Now, let's see.
No, no, no, no!
Betsy, put it down.
Down.
Down?
Easy. Easy.
There.
No, no.
No.
You'd better take my shoe off.
I can't get the knot undone.
Oh! My nail!
Shh.
Maybe I can help you.
There it goes again.
You remember Feisty McKenna?
Only with him, it wasn't harp noises.
He kept hearing birdcalls.
Easy, easy, easy.
Now, easy.
Okay.
Well.
Oh! Oh! Oh!
Mr. Hawk!
This is the fire chief speaking!
We'll have everything under control in just a moment.
Now, Mr. Hawk, try to relax.
Relax?
How can I relax, you fathead?
Mary Lou,
I wish you'd come over.
Pop's putting on a great show.
They're bringing in a net.
Make way. Come on.
Come down sitting.
Not feet first!
The net didn't work so well, Mary Lou.
I told you we needed a new one.
You told me?
What do you think I've been telling the council?
How am I supposed to buy a net without an appropriation?
Don't get hot.
I only mentioned it.
You just keep the kinks out of the fire hose.
That's all I want from you.
I'm the chief.
Sure! Come on over, Millie!
You should see it.
Don't worry, Mr. Hawk.
We'll take care of you.
No, don't do it!
No!
Ow!
Personally,
I'm a dry-fly man, myself.
Royal Coachman.
- Take it easy.
- Yeah, I got him.
Biff! Help me!
Do something before they kill me!
Coach, I know you're in spring practice.
But it's a matter of life and death!
That ain't no birdcall.
Well, look who's here.
It's the professor.
It wasn't smart breaking in like that.
Well, I didn't exactly break in.
Of course, as you can see,
I'm trying to break out.
Careful, boys.
Look!
What happened, boys?
You missed me?
Here I am!
Now, take it easy, boys.
Take it easy.
Don't crowd me!
Don't want to get tough with you again.
Barrel-fresh hot doggies!
They're a foot long!
Get your hot doggies!
Right this way!
Here we are, folks.
Hot dogs.
And you called the police?
Certainly. I was getting ready to take a bath.
I saw this face flashing past the window.
How did I know the poor man was in trouble?
Back!
Well, sir, I calculate he gains about 18 inches to bounce.
And your opinion is?
About 7:00 tonight, he's gonna be in serious trouble.
Gosh. My father never does anything like that.
For a parent, he's way out!
Excuse me, excuse me.
This way, fellas.
Son! What are you going to do to me?
One, two...
Biff! I'm your father!
Please!
Hike!
Pop!
Are you all right, Pop?
And why wouldn't I be?
The warehouse!
Oh, no. Once more, and we'd have had it open.
You're not gonna give up this easily.
It's just a bump on the head.
That's it. Come on.
What would Mr. Hawk say?
Come on, let's get on our feet.
On with the fight. Come on.
Here. Try this.
Oh. Thank you, dear.
That did it. Better get back in the car, Betsy.
All right, come on, you cut-rate gorillas!
- Hit him high this time.
- Got you.
Okay, Mr. Jumping Jack.
Look out!
Ned!
Corners beautifully, doesn't it?
Ned, look!
Here they come!
Come on, you guys!
Get in the car! Hurry up!
To think I always thought of you as a nice, easygoing college professor.
- Betsy?
- Mm-hmm?
No. This is hardly the time to say what I was going to say.
Never mind.
Go ahead. Say it.
Well...
What do you know?
They want to play rough.
Here. Give me that thing!
You can't do that, Pop!
We gotta show this nut we mean business!
Well, looky there.
A police car.
Well, well, well.
They've been asking for it.
Asking for what?
The Shelby Stomp.
It's Brainard!
- Faster, son!
- I've got it down to the floor!
- Hold it!
- All right!
All right, you birds!
Get your hands on the top of that car.
Now, this is ridiculous!
Do you realize who I am?
Yeah. You're the guy that had this hot pistol in his mitt.
I'm Alonzo P. Hawk, president of the Auld Lang Syne finance company!
Isn't it a small world?
Why, of course I remember you.
Well, that's better.
Sure, you're the outfit that repossessed my electric icebox last year.
Well, Officer Hanson!
Sorry, but can you tell me the shortest way to Washington, D.C.?
Sure, Professor.
Down the block to the intersection, left, Highway 9.
No, I mean as the crow flies.
Oh! That way.
Due East.
Thanks.
Officer, stop that man!
He's flying off with millions of dollars that belong to me!
Mr. Hawk, surely you're not accusing dear, old Professor...
I have an unknown approaching
Washington prohibited zone.
Heading 0-6-8.
Angels 1.5.
Speed 45 knots.
45 knots?
Are you sure?
Yes, sir.
Hello, Bird Farm?
This is Flag Down.
Scramble the 5-minute birds.
Attention, attention.
Scramble Bird Dog flight.
Scramble Bird Dog flight.
Vector 2-7-0.
Vector 2-7-0.
Go gate to angels 1.5.
Angels 1.5.
It's so lovely and peaceful up here.
As though we're the only people in the world.
Well, aren't we?
Ned.
Ned!
Did you see what I saw?
- I hope not!
- Let's run that again.
Roger.
Here they come again!
Let's get out of here!
Hello, Flag Down.
This is Bird Dog Leader.
I have a visual on that bogey.
Well, speak up, man.
What is it?
I don't think you're going to like this, sir.
What's the matter?
Give me that bogey report!
It's a Model T, sir.
A what?
A Model T Touring Car.
Only it's flying!
Bird Dog Leader,
I suggest for your own sake that you take another look.
I can't, sir.
It's gone into a cloud.
And it won't come out!
What's the procedure, sir?
I think I'll let the colonel handle this one.
Yes, Flag Down?
Well, go on, Captain.
Go on.
A flying what?
Cut the clowning Flag Down.
The C.O.'s here.
- What's going on, Colonel?
- Nothing.
What do you mean, nothing?
It's Flag Down.
Just a question of procedure.
Give me that.
What's all this?
Don't you know your job, man?
Don't interrupt me.
It might interest you to know the general staff has worked out exact procedure for every possible situation.
There's nothing could happen...
A flying what?
- Looks like they've gone.
- Good.
Can we get out of here now?
This is ruining my hairset.
Darling, you never looked more beautiful.
Gentlemen.
It's quite simple, really.
Obviously, a Model T cannot fly.
It must be something disguised as a Model T.
I am declaring a Condition Yellow.
Let's move, Colonel.
How lovely it is.
Makes you feel proud, doesn't it?
Washington's a great city.
There's something for everyone.
Look at all those people down there!
I think they're staring at us.
I wouldn't be a bit surprised.
I can't hear what they're yelling.
Hi, down there!
Oh, Ned!
Look out!
Kind of hits you between the eyes, doesn't it?
Look!
There's Grant's Tomb.
I think Grant's Tomb is in New York, dear.
I believe that's the Jefferson Memorial.
You mean Monticello?
Betsy, I think there's a map in the side pocket.
Will you see if you can find the Pentagon?
It has five sides and a big parking lot.
I doubt if it's on here, dear.
This map is from the year 1917.
Hmm? Oh!
Well.
Oh, there's the Capitol!
Won't that do?
The Capitol.
When you think of all the history made there.
Now, don't forget, you're making history right now.
Oh, you think so?
I hope they don't make a fuss.
We interrupt to bring you an emergency bulletin.
This is the commanding officer,
Sector Air Defense, speaking on all commercial and military wavelengths.
Attention!
An unidentified flying object is over the city.
I don't see anything.
No. Nothing up here but us.
Every defensive missile
- in the area
- Us!
Is trained on the flying object.
If it does not identify itself, it will be shot down immediately.
They wouldn't dare!
Oh, yes.
Yes, they'd dare.
This is your last warning.
Identify yourself or we will open fire.
Ready at Fort Mead?
Missile batteries locked on target, sir.
Repeat!
Are you listening, unidentified flying object?
We are waiting for your response!
I am responding!
I'm Professor Brainard!
At the count of 10, we open fire.
Don't bother to count, general!
I'm an American!
See? My credit cards!
Three...
Four...
Wait!
You're not gonna stand for that, are you?
Five...
Yes.
Six...
Seven...
Sir, Fort Mead reports he's gone behind the Capitol dome.
- Eight...
- Congress is in session.
If you fire, we might lose every senator and congressman.
Nine...
And they've just put a new front on the building.
Hold your fire.
Well, why try to pass the buck to me?
Just because it looks like a...
What?
Well, I don't care if it is a Model T!
Shoot it down!
Right, right.
And if you happen to see a Stutz Bearcat or a Pope-Toledo flying over the Capitol, shoot them down, too.
As a personal favor, won't you please identify yourself?
Professor, this is the admiral.
Proceed to Anacostia
Naval Air Station.
This is General Singer.
You fly to Bolling
Air Force Base.
This is the Army.
Report to Fort Myer.
- Anacostia Naval Air Station!
- Bolling Air Force Base!
- Bolling Air Force Base!
- Fort Myer!
Now hear this!
Anacostia.
They had their chance.
I'm not gonna fool around.
What are you doing?
We're going to land.
On that big patch of green lawn.
- Oh, Ned. Not there, please!
- Why not?
Well, my hair is a mess!
And I haven't a thing to wear!
Anybody home?
Ned!
Professor, what did the president have to say?
Well...
The president, devoted to the advance of science, has embraced the discovery of Flubber with enthusiasm.
Professor, what branch of the services will be given control of your new discovery?
Well...
All will share alike.
In our opinion,
Flubber will only cement the great traditional ties of interservice cooperation.
Professor, with this great breakthrough in science, do you feel you still have other worlds to conquer?
I do.
Just so there's no doubt about it, would you mind repeating that?
I do.
With pleasure, and a deep sense of accomplishment,
I now pronounce you man and wife.
Firecracker!
Firecracker! Sis-boom-bah!
Medfield! Medfield!
Rah, rah, rah!
Goodbye, Betsy!
Good luck!
Call on Dolly
If your neighbour needs a new romance
Just name the kind of man your sister wants, and she'll snatch him up
Don't forget to bring your maiden aunts and she'll match 'em up
Call on
"Mrs. Dolly Levi."
She's the one the spinsters recommend
She even found a lovely bride for poor cousin Isadore
"Social introductions arranged."
Drag your single relations out
In a week you'll have to send engraved invitations out
"In an atmosphere of elegance and refinement."
Call on Dolly
"Object: matrimony."
If your eldest daughter needs a friend
Just name the kind of man your sister wants, and she'll snatch him up
Don't forget to bring your maiden aunts and she'll match 'em up
Call on Dolly
If your eldest daughter needs a friend
I have always been a woman who arranges things
For the pleasure and the profit it derives
I have always been a woman who arranges things
Like furniture and daffodils and lives
If you want your sister courted, brother wed or cheese imported
Just leave everything to me
If you want your roof inspected, eyebrows tweezed or bills collected
Just leave everything to me
If you want your daughter dated, or some marriage consummated
For a rather modest fee
If you want a husband spotted, boyfriend traced or chicken potted
I'll arrange for making all arrangements
Just leave everything to me
- Business or pleasure, Mrs. Levi?
- Mr. Jones, business is always a pleasure.
And you've got more businesses than a dog has fleas!
As my late husband, Ephraim Levi, used to say:
"If you have to live from hand to mouth, you better be ambidextrous!"
If you want your ego bolstered, muscles toned or chair upholstered
Just leave everything to me
Charming social introductions, expert mandolin instructions
Just leave everything to me
If you want your culture rounded,
French improved or torso pounded
With a ten-year guarantee
If you want a birth recorded, collies bred or kittens boarded
I'll proceed to plan the whole procedure
Just leave everything to me
- Where to, Dolly?
- Yonkers.
To handle a highly personal matter for Mr. Vandergelder, the well-known unmarried half-a-millionaire.
- Gonna marry him yourself?
- Why, Mr. Sullivan, whatever put such a preposterous idea into my head?
Your head.
If you want a law abolished, jury swayed or toenails polished
Just leave everything to me
If you want your liver tested, glasses made, cash invested
Just leave everything to me
If you want your children coddled, corsets boned or furs remodelled
Or some nice, fresh fricassee
If you want your bustle shifted, wedding planned or bosom lifted
Don't be ashamed, girls!
Life is full of secrets and I keep 'em!
I'll discreetly use my own discretion
I'll arrange for making all arrangements
I'll proceed to plan the whole procedure
Just leave everything
To me
- And I'm telling you that I will marry her!
- Not without my permission, you won't!
This is a free country, not a private kingdom.
She's consented and I'll marry her.
- I'm telling you that you won't.
- I'm telling you I will.
- Never.
- Tomorrow. Today.
Ermengarde is not for you.
You can't support her. You are an artist.
- I make a good living.
- A living, Mr. Kemper, is made by selling something that everybody needs at least once a year.
And a million is made by producing something everybody needs every day.
You artists, you painters, produce nothing that nobody needs, never.
You might as well know, any way we can find to get married is right and fair and we'll do it.
You are an impractical, seven-foot-tall nincompoop.
- That's an insult.
- All the facts about you are insults.
- Thank you for the honour of your visit.
- Ermengarde is of age and there's no law...
Law? The law is there to prevent crime. Men of sense are there to prevent foolishness.
It is I that will prevent you from marrying my niece.
And I've already taken the necessary steps.
Mrs. Dolly Levi is on her way here even now.
Dolly Levi? Your marriage broker?
Never mind that. She'll pick up Ermengarde and take her to New York, and keep her there until this foolishness is over.
- We'll see about that.
- Thank you again for the honour...
You have to sit still, Mr. Vandergelder.
If I cut your throat it will be practically unintentional.
90% of the people in this world are fools and the rest are in great danger of contamination.
Enough of this.
I'm a busy man with things to do.
A scraped chin is the least of them.
I did the best I could, Mr. Vandergelder.
- Joe.
- Yes?
I've got special reasons for looking my best today.
Is there something a little extra you can do? A little special?
What?
You know, do some of those things you do to the young fellas.
Smarten me up a little bit.
Face massage. A little perfume water.
All I know is 15 cents' worth, like usual, and that includes all that's decent to do.
Listen, I don't want you blabbing this, but I need something extra today because I'm going to New York to call on a very refined lady, name of Miss Irene Molloy.
Your callin' on ladies is none of my business, Mr. Vandergelder.
- Hold your horses, Joe.
- Uncle Horace!
- Uncle Horace!
- Yes, what is it?
- What have you done to Ambrose?
- I had a quiet talk with him.
- You did?
- Yes, I explained to him that he's a fool.
- Oh, Uncle!
- Weeping, weeping - a waste of water.
I've done you a good turn.
You'll thank me when you're 50.
But, Uncle, I love him.
Save your tears for New York, where they won't be noticed.
- But I love him!
- You don't.
- But I do!
- Leave those things to me.
If I don't marry Ambrose, I know I'll die!
- Of what?
- A broken heart.
Never heard of it. Are you ready for Mrs. Levi when she comes?
Yes.
Well, get ready some more and stay in your room until she arrives.
Cornelius!
Barnaby!
Barnaby!
Cornelius! Barnaby!
- You stamped, Mr. Vandergelder?
- Yes, I stamped.
Are my niece's bags at the railroad station?
- Yes.
- And you, did you label them properly?
- Yes.
- Good.
I'm going to New York on important business, then I'll be marching in the parade.
- Yes, Mr. Vandergelder.
- I'm planning to stay at the Central Hotel.
We've never been here alone,
Mr. Vandergelder.
Now, in honour of the occasion, I'll promote you both. Cornelius, how old are you?
28¾, Mr. Vandergelder.
Is that all? That's a foolish age to be at. I thought you were 40.
No, I'm 28¾.
Well, a man's not worth a cent till he's 40.
We pay him wages until then to make mistakes.
- Anyway, I'm promoting you to chief clerk.
- Chief clerk?
- Yes.
- Well, what am I now?
You're an impertinent fool. If you behave,
I'll promote you from fool to chief clerk, with a raise in your wages.
Thank you, Mr. Vandergelder.
You, Barnaby, I'm promoting you from idiot apprentice to incompetent clerk.
- Thank you, Mr. Vandergelder.
- Mr. Vandergelder? Mr. Vandergelder?
What is it?
Does the chief clerk get one evening off a week?
So that's how you thank me, eh?
No, sir. You'll attend to the store as usual.
You keep on asking for evenings free and you'll find you have all your days free.
Yes, Mr. Vandergelder.
And when I come back I wanna hear that you ran the place perfectly.
If I hear of any foolishness, I'll fire you both.
Yes.
You might as well know it now.
When I return there will be some changes around here.
- You're going to have a mistress.
- I'm too young, Mr. Vandergelder.
Not yours, idiot. Mine. I mean,
I'm planning to get married.
- Married?
- Yes, married. Any objections?
No, but...
No, many congratulations,
Mr. Vandergelder.
- And to the lady.
- That's none of your business.
- Any questions?
- No, but...
- But what?
- But I mean...
- Speak up.
- Why?
- Why what, damn it! Speak up!
- Why are you getting married?
Let me tell you something, son.
I've worked hard and I've become rich and friendless and mean.
And in America it's about as far as you can go.
It's time to be doing something a little bit foolish.
Besides, I need a steady housekeeper.
It takes a woman, all powdered and pink
To joyously clean out the drain in the sink
And it takes an angel with long, golden lashes
And soft Dresden fingers for dumping the ashes
Yes, it takes a woman, a dainty woman
A sweetheart, a mistress, a wife
Oh, yes, it takes a woman
A fragile woman
To bring you the sweet things in life
The frail young maiden, who's constantly there
For washing and blueing, and shoeing the mare
And it takes a female for setting the table
And weaning the Guernsey and cleaning the stable
Yes, it takes a woman
A dainty woman
A sweetheart, a mistress, a wife
Oh, yes, it takes a woman
A fragile woman
To bring you the sweet things in life
And so she'll work until infinity
Three cheers for femininity
God bless fem-i-nin-i-ty
And in the winter she'll shovel the ice
And lovingly set out the traps for the mice
She's a joy and treasure for, practically speaking,
To whom can you turn when the plumbing is leaking?
To that dainty woman
That fragile woman
That sweetheart, that mistress, that wife
That womanly wife
Oh, yes, it takes a woman
A husky woman
To bring you the sweet things in life
Oh, yes, it takes a woman
A dainty woman
A sweetheart, a mistress, a wife
Oh, yes, it takes a woman
A fragile woman
To bring you the sweet things in life
Well, well, well, well, well.
Good morning, Mr. Vandergelder.
Mr. Hackl. Mr. Tucker.
- Gentlemen.
- Good morning, ma'am.
Uh, morning, Mrs. Levi.
How handsome you look today. Ooh, you absolutely take my breath away.
Ermengarde is crying her eyes out.
You can take her to New York, but blow her nose first.
If only Irene Molloy could see you now.
Find someplace else to loaf. And you two get back to the store. Go on!
And don't forget to put the lid on the sheep dip.
I don't know what's come over you lately, but you seem to be growing younger every day.
Well, if a man eats careful, there's no reason why he should look old.
- You never said a truer word.
- Even if I never see 40... uh, 35, again.
35. I can see that you're the sort that will be stamping about at 100, eating five meals a day, like my Uncle Harry, may he rest in peace.
Let me see your hand, Mr. Vandergelder.
Oh, show me your hand.
- Why?
- I'm a judge of hands. I read hands.
- And I use them to get things done.
- Oh! Lord in heaven! Goodness gracious!
Oh, I just can't believe it.
It's such a long lifeline.
- Where?
- From here I don't know where it goes.
It runs right off your hand.
They'll have to hit you with a mallet.
They'll have to stifle you with a sofa pillow. You'll bury us all.
I will?
Say, you're all spiffed up today, aren't you?
- Yes.
- And not for this smelly horse, either.
Well, if I had to guess,
I'd say you was goin' somewhere.
Remarkable, Mrs. Levi. How do you do it?
Two and two is four, Mr. Vandergelder.
With a head like yours you'll be a rich woman someday.
That's exactly what I had in mind.
Then I suggest you go about your business and pick up Ermengarde,
- for which I am paying you good money.
- Speaking of business, Mr. Vandergelder,
I suppose you've given up all idea of getting married?
- Is that what you suppose?
- Uh-huh.
Then suppose you listen to this, Mrs. Levi.
I've decided I've practically decided to ask Irene Molloy to be my wife.
- You have?
- Yes, I have.
I'm going to New York and discuss it with her this very afternoon.
Well, that is just about the best news
I have ever heard, Mr. Vandergelder.
Oh, yes, indeed. Marvellous news.
Oh, dear me. Isn't it wonderful?
I mean, I'm racking my brain, trying to think of something that's made me happier, but I just can't come up with a thing, because this is just too wonderful.
Well, it's all your fault, you know.
You put me into this marryin' frame of mind with all your introductions and scheming.
- A widow has to earn a living.
- One day I wake up
- and the house seems like an empty shell.
- Certainly is.
- And messy, too.
- Certainly is.
A man needs someone to take out the garbage.
And Irene Molloy's just the one to do it. Oh, darling girl.
Well, I think it's perfectly wonderful what's going to happen in your household.
I never did like the idea of all that money of yours lying around in piles in the bank, so useless and motionless. As my late husband, Ephraim Levi, used to say:
"Money should circulate like rainwater."
"It should flow down among the people, through little dressmakers and restaurants, setting up a business here, furnishing a good time there."
I just know that you and Mrs. Vandergelder will see that all your hard-earned wealth starts flowing in and around many people's lives, just flowing...
- All right. Stop saying that!
- Pouring out...
So there's nothing more for me to do but wish you happiness
- and say goodbye.
- Yes, well, goodbye.
And when I get to New York,
I'll tell the girl I had lined up for you, the heiress, not to wait.
- What did you say?
- Oh, nothing, nothing. A word. "Heiress."
Well, just a minute. That's kind of unusual, isn't it, Mrs. Levi?
Well, I haven't been wearing myself to the bone hunting up usual girls to interest you.
But now all that's too late.
You're engaged to marry Irene Molloy.
- I am not engaged.
- I cannot keep upsetting the finest women around unless you mean business.
- Who said I don't mean business?
- You're playing a very dangerous game.
- Dangerous?
- Of course it's dangerous. It's called
"tampering with a woman's affections".
The only way to save yourself from that charge is to get married to someone soon, very soon.
- Don't worry.
- I won't.
I'll meet you in front of
Irene Molloy's hat shop at 2. 30.
- Never mind. You've done your work.
- I wouldn't miss it for the world.
I want to be there to make sure nothing goes wrong.
Just tend to Ermengarde or else I'll ask you to return the fee I gave you for that.
- Speaking of money...
- Oh, no. How much?
Well, I left my money in the handbag I took to the cleaner's just before it burned down.
20! Oh, bless you, and don't you worry your handsome head about a thing.
Just keep all your thoughts on that lovely Irene Molloy.
It takes a woman to quietly plan
To take him and change him to her kind of man
And to gently lead him where fortune can find him
And not let him know
That the power behind him
Was that dainty woman
That fragile woman
That sweetheart
That mistress
That wife
Da, da, da, da
Da, da, da
If he had any taste at all, he'd have the shutters done over in green.
Mm, forest-green shutters.
-  What are you doing?
-  Hurry!
- My uncle...
- He just left.
Now quick! We're running away.
- Running away?
- Hurry, before the train gets here!
- Train?
- To New York, to get married.
- We're going to elope.
- Elope? That's such an awful word.
- Oh, Ermengarde.
- My, what a romantic scene.
Oh, Mrs. Levi, please explain to Ambrose.
I wanna marry him, but not elope.
- This doesn't concern Mrs. Levi.
- Everything concerns Dolly Levi.
- Don't listen to her. I know why you're here.
- To help. Love needs all the help it can get.
- Wait a minute. Listen to me.
- There's no time.
Can we climb in? I feel an updraught in my underpants.
- Oh, Mrs. Levi!
- This is no way to elope.
If you follow my suggestions, not only will he let you marry but he'll dance at your wedding.
And not alone, either.
Mr. Kemper, can you dance?
- Dance? I'm an artist, Mrs. Levi. I paint.
- No problem.
- "Mrs. Levi. Painters taught how to dance."
- Here's what we'll do.
- I'm going to take you to New York.
- See? I told you.
You will stay close by. Tonight you will take her to dinner at the Harmonia Gardens.
There's this man, Rudolph Reisenweber.
He knows me well.
We'll enter you in the polka contest.
The prize is a gold cup and some money, and you'll win it.
- Oh, the cups we won, my husband and I.
- Now, wait a minute.
I'm surprised you have acquaintances in a place like that.
Not acquaintances, Ermengarde. Friends.
Dear friends from days gone by.
My late husband, Ephraim Levi, believed in life, any place you could find it, wherever there were people, all kinds of people.
And every Friday night, even when times were bad, every Friday night, like clockwork, down those stairs of the Harmonia
Gardens we came, Ephraim and I.
Not acquaintances, Ermengarde. Friends.
It's all very well for you, but you're suggesting that we...
Mr. Kemper, do you or do you not wish to show Horace that you mean business?
Yes!
All right, then. Go to the Harmonia
Gardens and say that Mrs. Levi sent you.
And, oh... yes, well, tell Rudolph...
Tell Rudolph that Dolly's coming back.
Dolly's coming back?
And I want a table for two and a chicken for eight o'clock.
Mr. Vandergelder will learn of your triumph and everything will work out beautifully.
- But how, Mrs. Levi? How?
- How?
Oh.
28¾ years old and I still don't get an evening free.
When am I gonna begin to live?
Barnaby? How much money have you got?
- H uh?
- I mean, that you can get your hands on?
- About three dollars. Why?
- Barnaby, you and I are going to New York.
Cornelius, we can't. Close the store?
We'll have to, cos some rotten cans of chicken mash are going to explode.
Holy cabooses! How do you know?
Because I'll light some candles under them.
They'll make such a stink that customers won't be able to come in for 24 hours.
That'll get us an evening free. We are going to New York and we are gonna live.
We're gonna have a good meal, be in danger, get almost arrested.
- And we're gonna spend all our money.
- Holy cabooses!
And one more thing.
We are not coming back to Yonkers until we've each kissed a girl.
Cornelius, you can't do that.
You don't know any girls.
I'm 28¾. I gotta begin sometime.
I'm only 19½.
With me it's not so urgent.
May I make a suggestion, gentlemen?
Mrs. Levi.
- I just couldn't help hearing.
- We'll be fired.
- We were only talking.
- Mr. Hackl, Mr. Tucker, there is nothing that makes me happier than the thought of two fine young men enjoying the company of two lovely ladies.
- What ladies? Where?
- In New York, Mr. Hackl, to which, unless my ears play me tricks, you are bound.
Now, there's this millinery shop run by a charming woman.
- "Irene Molloy"?
- And her attractive assistant, Minnie Fay.
And now that you've noted the address, I have only this to say.
Two o'clock in the afternoon there is the ideal time for friendly conversation.
Definitely no later than 2. 30.
And if you ever say that this was my suggestion, well, I should denounce you both for the terrible liars that you are.
- A millinery shop.
- Women who work!
- Adventure, Barnaby.
- I'm scared.
- Living, Barnaby.
- I'm scared.
- Will ya come, Barnaby?
- Yes, Cornelius! Yes!
The lights of Broadway! Elevated trains!
The stuffed whale at Barnum's museum!
Stuffed whale! Wow!
Women who work! Wow!
All clear up here, Cornelius!
You gonna light 'em all?
Cornelius, look out! That bottom row, they're swelled up like they're ready to burst!
- Holy cabooses! What a smell!
- Let's get dressed, Barnaby.
We're going to New York!
Out there
There's a world outside of Yonkers
Way out there beyond this hick town, Barnaby
There's a slick town, Barnaby
Out there
Full of shine and full of sparkle
Close your eyes and see it glisten, Barnaby
Listen, Barnaby
Put on your Sunday clothes, there's lots of world out there
Get out the brilliantine and dime cigars
We're gonna find adventure in the evening air
Girls in white in a perfumed night
Where the lights are bright as the stars
Put on your Sunday clothes, we're gonna ride through town
In one of those new horse-drawn open cars
We'll see the shows at Delmonico's
And we'll close the town in a whirl
And we won't come home until we've kissed a girl
Put on your Sunday clothes when you feel down and out
Strut down the street and have your picture took
Dressed like a dream your spirits seem to turn about
That Sunday shine is a certain sign
That you feel as fine as you look
Beneath your parasol the world is all a smile
That makes you feel brand-new down to your toes
Get out your feathers, your patent leathers
Your beads and buckles and bows
For there's no blue Monday in your Sunday
No Monday in your Sunday
No Monday in your Sunday clothes
Put on your Sunday clothes when you feel down and out
Strut down the street and have your picture took
Dressed like a dream your spirits seem to turn about
That Sunday shine is a certain sign
That you feel as fine as you look
Beneath your parasol the world is all a smile
That makes you feel brand-new down to your toes
Get out your feathers, your patent leathers
Your beads and buckles and bows
For there's no blue Monday in your Sunday clothes
Put on your Sunday clothes when you feel down and out
Strut down the street and have your picture took
Dressed like a dream your spirits seem to turn about
That Sunday shine is a certain sign
That you feel as fine as you look
Beneath your bowler brim the world's a simple song
A lovely lilt that makes you tilt your nose
Get out your slickers
Your flannel knickers
Your red suspenders and hose
For there's no blue Monday
In your Sunday
No blue Monday
In your Sunday clothes
Ermengarde, keep smiling.
No man wants a little ninny.
Ambrose, do a turn, let me see.
Mr. Hackl, Mr. Tucker, don't forget Irene and Minnie, just forget you ever heard a word from me.
All aboard! All aboard!
All aboard!
Put on your Sunday clothes, there's lots of world out there
Put on your silk cravat and patent shoes
We're gonna find adventure in the evening air
To town we'll trot to a smoky spot
Where the girls are hot as a fuse
Put on your silk high hat and at the turned-up cuff
We'll wear a handmade grey suede buttoned glove
You're gonna take New York by storm
We'll join the Astors at Tony Pastor's
And this I'm positive of
That we won't come home
No, we won't come home
No, we won't come home until we fall in love
Do get done with that, Minnie. The men are eyeing us for the wrong reason.
- A banana a day keeps the doctor away.
- An apple a day.
Do doctors slip on apple peels?
- How are you, Miss Molloy?
- If I felt any better I'd be indecent.
- You are in a mood today.
- I certainly am.
Not that it's any of my business...
Oh, but is it because...? I mean...
I don't mind that you never finish lunch, but I mind that you never finish sentences.
Well, what I meant was, are you really going to?
Silly girl, say it. Am I going to marry Horace Vandergelder?
Yes, I'm seriously considering it, if he asks me.
Oh, I'd rather die on the rack than ask you such a personal question, but why would you?
Because he's rich, that's why. He can rescue me from the millinery business. I hate hats.
- Hate hats?
- A good afternoon to you, Officer Gogarty.
And the rest of the day to you, Miss Molloy.
Ah, Minnie, why is it that all the attractive men in New York are married?
Blarney, Miss Molloy! Blarney!
Come on now, get going, all of you.
- Oh, the way you talk!
- It's natural to talk about men.
- I mean, what you said about hating hats.
- Particularly the women who buy them.
- You don't mean that.
- Oh, yes, I do, Minnie Fay.
All lady milliners are suspected of being wicked women.
Half the time those dowagers who come in, come in merely to stare and wonder.
Oh, how dare they!
And if they were sure, they'd not set foot in the shop again.
- Well, good riddance. Who needs them?
- We do, unfortunately.
So, do I go out to restaurants?
No, it would be bad for business.
Do I go to balls or theatres or operas?
No, it would be bad for business.
The only men I ever meet are the feather merchants who come to sell me things.
Minnie, I'm tired of being suspected of being a wicked woman with nothing to show for it.
Miss Molloy!
Why does everybody have adventures but me?
- Adventures?
- Because I have no spirit, no gumption.
Either I marry Horace Vandergelder or I'm gonna burn this shop down, break out like a fire engine and find myself some excitement.
The things you're saying today.
They're just awful.
Oh, aren't they, though?
And I'm enjoying every word of it.
What's this? A return from
Miss Mortimer again?
Same old story. She wants cherries and feathers. To catch a beau, I suppose.
If you ask me, she'd do better with a heavy veil.
I told her ribbons down the back is the thing to catch a gentleman's eye.
But she'd have none of it.
Minnie, make another hat for Miss Mortimer.
I'm wearing this one myself.
- Oh, but you can't.
- Why not?
Oh, because it's... it's provocative.
That's why not.
Well, who knows that "provocative" isn't just what I might wanna be today.
I'll be wearing ribbons down my back
This summer
Blue and green and streaming in the yellow sky
So if someone special comes my way
This summer
He might notice me
Passing by
And so I'll try to make it easier to find me
In the stillness of July
Because a breeze might stir a rainbow up behind me
That might happen to catch
The gentleman's eye
And he might smile and take me by the hand
This summer
Making me recall how lovely love can be
And so I will proudly wear
Ribbons down my back
Shining in my hair
That he might notice me
Miss Molloy, you don't love
Horace Vandergelder, do you?
- Of course I don't love him.
- Then how can you... I mean...?
Minnie, look. There are two men staring at the shop.
- Men?
- Uh-huh. Aren't they delicious?
You don't think...?
Yes, I do believe they mean to come in here.
- Men in the shop? What'll we do?
- Why, flirt with them, of course.
- I'll give you the short one.
- You're terrible.
We'll heat them up and drop them cold.
Good practice for married life.
- Let's pretty ourselves up a bit.
- If you say "vamp", I'll scream.
- Vamp!
- Agh!
I must say, I like the tall one.
Adventure, Barnaby.
We can still catch the train back to Yonkers.
I feel dizzy.
Or go see the stuffed whale at the museum.
Women, Barnaby.
Stuffed women!
There's no one here. We can leave.
I'd never forgive myself. Agh!
Are you sure this is an adventure,
Cornelius?
You don't have to ask. When you're in one, you'll know it all right.
- How much money is left?
- 40 cents for the train,
30 cents for dinner and
20 cents to see the whale.
Well, when they come out, we'll pretend we're rich.
- That way we won't have to spend a thing.
- Why not say that Mrs. Levi sent us?
No, we're not supposed to ever say that. Shh!
We're two men about town looking for hats for ladies.
What ladies?
"Good afternoon, ma'am.
Wonderful weather we're having."
"How do you do, ma'am?
And how are your hats?"
"Charmed to make your acquaintance.
Lovely place you have here."
Good afternoon, gentlemen.
- Cornelius Hackl here.
- Barnaby Tucker here.
Irene Molloy here.
I'm very happy to meet you.
Is there anything I can do for you?
See, we're two ladies about town lookin' for hats to Molloy...
We're hats, you see, and wondered if we could buy a lady or two to Molloy with for...
We want a hat. Well, for a lady, of course.
And everyone said to go to
Miss Molloy's cos she's so pretty.
I mean her hats are so pretty.
And what sort of hat would Mrs. Hackl be liking?
Oh, no, Miss Molloy, there is no Mrs. Hackl.
Yes, there is. Your mother.
She didn't mean that.
- Did you, Miss Molloy?
- Now, this lady friend of yours, couldn't she come in with you someday and choose the hat herself?
Impossible. There is no lady friend.
But I thought you said that you were coming here to choose...
- I mean, she's Barnaby's.
- Huh? What?
Yes, but she lives in Yonkers and she said to pick out something reasonable.
- Under a dollar.
- Don't be silly, Barnaby.
Money's no object with us. None at all.
Oh, this is my assistant,
Miss Minnie Fay. Mr. Hackl. Mr. Tucker.
- Good afternoon, ma'am.
- Afternoon ma'am.
Excuse me, Mr. Tucker, did you say Yonkers?
Yes, ma'am, we're from Yonkers.
Well, are you?
Yes. And, forgive me for saying this, but you should see Yonkers, Miss Molloy.
Well, perhaps you and your gentleman friend here in New York might like to see it.
Some say it's the most beautiful town in the world.
- That's what they say.
- So I've heard.
But I'm afraid I don't have a gentleman friend here in New York.
You don't? Barnaby, she doesn't have a gentleman friend.
Hey, that's too bad. You know, if you should happen to have a Sunday free...
You're Catholic, aren't you? Don't let that worry you. I'd be willing to change.
If you're free in the near future, I'd...
Well, we'd like to show you Yonkers from top to bottom.
It's very historic.
As a matter of fact, I might be there sooner than you think.
- This Sunday?
- I have a friend who lives in Yonkers.
- You do?
- Perhaps you know him.
I do?
It's always so foolish to ask in cases like that, isn't it?
Why should you know him?
It's a Mr. Vandergelder.
Mr. Vandergelder? Oh!
- Horace Vandergelder?
- Of Vandergelder's Hay and Feed?
- Yes. Do you know him?
-  Oh, no! No!
No, no, no, no, no, no...
As a matter of fact, he's coming here to see me this very afternoon.
- Coming here?
- This afternoon?
Cornelius! Cornelius, look!
It's a wolf trap.
Look out!
- Begging your pardon.
- What are you doing?
- We'll explain later. Help us just this once.
- Come out of there this minute.
We're as innocent as can be, Miss Molloy.
Mr. Hackl, Mr. Tucker, I insist that you both come out or I'll be forced to...
Mr. Vandergelder, how nice to see you.
- And Dolly Levi, what a surprise.
- Irene, my darling, how well you look.
- You must be in love.
- Afternoon, Miss Molloy.
What a pleasure to have you in New York, Mr. Vandergelder.
Yes, Yonkers lies up there decimated today.
We thought we'd pay you a little visit, Irene.
Unless it's inconvenient?
Inconvenient? Whatever gave you that idea?
Mr. Vandergelder thought he saw two customers in the shop. Two, uh, men?
Men? In a ladies' hat shop?
Come, let's go into my workroom.
I'm so eager for you to see it.
- I've already seen it twice.
- But I need your advice.
Advice from Mr. Vandergelder. The whole city should hear this and grow rich.
Advice is cheap. It's what comes gift-wrapped that counts.
- I have never heard it put more beautifully.
- Thank you, Mr. Vandergelder.
Chocolate-covered peanuts. Unshelled.
They're the expensive kind.
- Why don't we open them in the workroom?
- I've come here today because I've important business to discuss with you, just as soon as Mrs. Levi says goodbye.
Pay no attention to me. I'm just browsing.
Business, Mr. Vandergelder?
The hay and feed business?
- Well, not exactly.
- A new hat shop in Yonkers?
I hear it's a very beautiful city and quite historic, according...
Yes, go on. Who's been telling you about Yonkers, may I ask?
Nobody. A friend.
What friend?
Well, you see, he...
- He?
- Yes, uh... he...
- H is name, Miss Molloy?
- What?
His name?
Oh, I believe it was... is...
Mr. Cornelius Hackl of Yonkers.
- Cornelius Hackl?
- Yes. Do you know him?
- He's my head clerk.
- He is?
He's been with me for ten years.
Where would you have known him?
Ah, just one of those chance meetings.
Yes, oh, yes, one of those chance meetings.
Chance meetings? Cornelius Hackl has no right to chance meetings. Where was it?
Really, it's very unlike you to question me in such a way.
Well, the truth might as well come out now as later.
Your head clerk is better known than you think.
Nonsense.
He's here all the time. He goes everywhere.
He's well-liked. Everybody knows Cornelius Hackl.
He never comes here. He works all day and then goes to sleep in the bran room at nine.
- So you think, but it's not true.
- Dolly Levi, you are mistaken.
Horace Vandergelder, you keep your nose so deep in your accounts you don't know what goes on.
By day, Cornelius Hackl is your faithful, trusted clerk, but by night... oh, by night...
He leads a double life, that is all.
Why, he is... why, he's... why, he's here... at the opera.
At the great restaurants, in all the fashionable homes.
He's even at the Harmonia Gardens three times a week.
The fact is, Mr. Vandergelder, he is the wittiest, the gayest, the naughtiest, most delightful man in New York City.
He's the famous Cornelius Hackl.
It ain't the same man. If I thought Cornelius
Hackl came to New York, I'd discharge him.
Who took the horses out of Jenny Lind's carriage and pulled her through the streets?
Who dressed up as a waiter and took an oyster and dropped it right down...?
- It's too wicked. I can't say it.
- Say it!
- No, but it was Cornelius Hackl.
- Where'd he get the money?
- Oh, he's very rich.
- Rich? I keep his money in my old safe.
He has $145. 36
Oh, you are killing me.
He is one of the Hackls.
- The Hackls?
- Yes, they built the Raritan Canal.
- Then why work for me?
- Well, I'll tell ya.
I don't wanna hear it. I have a headache. It ain't the same man.
He sleeps in my bran room.
I just made him my chief clerk.
If you had sense, you'd make him a partner.
Irene, I can see you're quite taken with him.
But I only met him once.
Now, don't you be thinking of marrying him.
- Darling, what are you saying?
- He breaks hearts like hickory nuts.
-  Who?
- Cornelius Hackl.
Miss Molloy, how long has he been calling on you?
Mr. Vandergelder, suppose I were to tell you that he has not been calling on me?
- Excuse me.
- Not now, Minnie.
- Aaagh!
- Stop singing.
- There's a man!
- That's not amusing.
And we don't wish to be interrupted.
Go back to the workroom immediately. Immediately.
- The poor dear is tired from overwork.
- If there's a man in there, we'll get him out!
- Whoever you are, come out of there!
- Do you realise what you're saying?
- I certainly do.
- Now just a minute.
Before you make another move or say another word that you might regret,
- allow me.
- Dolly.
Stand back.
There, you see? So much for this nonsense about that darling girl hiding a man in there.
I think we'll just forget you ever said it. It's forgotten.
Because there's nobody in there.
- Atchoo!
- God bless you.
Miss Molloy?
Yes, Mr. Vandergelder, there is a man in there.
- I see.
- There also happens to be an explanation.
For the present, I think I should just thank you for your visit and say good afternoon.
Atchoo!
- Another?
- Another.
Good Lord, the whole room is crawling with men. Irene, darling, congratulations.
Miss Molloy, I shan't trouble you again. And I hope vice versa.
Horace, where are you going?
To march in the 14th Street parade with the kind of people I can trust.
700 men.
Shut up!
Now.
- Have you met Miss Minnie Fay?
- Leave my shop or I'll call Officer Gogarty.
Irene, there's no fun in the jailhouse.
Everybody, don't talk at once.
- Just because you're rich...
- Don't deny it.
Doesn't mean you shouldn't make up for this.
- We'll do anything.
- This is Cornelius Hackl.
- We've already met. How do you do?
- Jail is absolutely out.
- Cornelius, explain to her.
- I'm Cornelius Hackl.
- It seems to me...
- Yes, the only way to make up for it...
Irene, send for the law at once.
You can have them put away for years on a charge like this.
Help, police! Only, have dinner with them first.
That's to show that you tried to settle amicably.
That's how to do it.
Dinner first, life imprisonment later.
It'll be a lovely evening. Who knows what'll happen before you send them off to jail?
- Mr. Hackl?
- Oh, by all means.
- It's what we had in mind all along.
- Minnie, we've been respectable for years.
Now we're in disgrace, we might as well make the most of it.
- It is the only sensible thing to do.
- Cornelius...
Now, I know a doughnut shop in the station.
Doughnut shop? Certainly not.
We want a fine dinner in a fashionable place.
And I know just the place.
The Harmonia Gardens on 14th Street.
- Your favourite restaurant.
- Wait a minute...
The finest food that money can buy and a lovely orchestra. A polka contest tonight.
- Ooh, dancing.
- Rudolph will give you the best table.
- We could never go there.
- It sounds marvellous.
Come, Minnie. We'll close the shop and take the whole afternoon off.
Oh, I mean, we could never...
Don't misunderstand me, it isn't the money or anything...
It's the... the...
What, Mr. Hackl?
It's the dancing. You see, I don't know how.
And they have contests at the Harmonia... whatever it is.
You said so yourself, and I don't know how.
It would take weeks, months, years to learn.
"Mrs. Dolly Levi. 28¾-year-old chief clerks taught how to d..."
Now, you just put one arm here and one arm there.
It's no use. I have no sense of rhythm.
Absolutely no sense of rhythm is the primary requirement for learning by the Levi method.
Just give me five minutes.
I'll have you dancing in the streets. the waltz kick turn.
Right foot, touch, left foot, touch, under, back, around, touch.
Back, through, around, behind.
Out, over... release... unfurl!
Oh, oh, that's just absolutely wonderful, Mr. Hackl.
When I think of the lucky women who'll find heaven in your arms!
I think we'll go back to lesson one, shall we?
Put your hand on her waist and stand, with her right in your left hand.
And...
One. That's right.
And one, two, three.
Ah!
One, two, three.
Oh, no. This one. And one, two, three.
One, two, three.
Look! I'm dancing!
- I was.
- Of course you were, Mr. Hackl.
Take the someone whose arms you're in
Hold on to her tight
And spin
And one, two, three
One, two, three
One, two, three
Look! I'm dancing!
Ah! Come here.
Turn around and turn around, try floating through the air
Can 't you be a little more aesthetic?
Don't you think my dancing has a polish and a flair?
The word I think I'd use is athletic.
Well, my heart is about to burst
My head is about to pop
And now that I'm dancing who cares if I ever stop?
That's wonderful.
Look, everybody!
I, Cornelius Hackl, sport, I'm dancing!
You're next, Mr. Tucker.
Glide and step
And then step and glide
And everyone stand aside!
Not... not yet, Mr. Tucker. One, two, three.
One, two, three. One, two, three, one...
- Look! He's dancing!
- I think he's holdin' out on us.
You could learn to polka if you worked a week or so
Or the tango filled with passion seething
I might join the chorus of the Castle Garden show
Whatever you do, Mr. Tucker, keep breathing.
For my heart is about to burst
My head is about to pop
And now that we're dancing who cares if we ever stop?
Oh.
When there's someone you hardly know
And wish you were closer to
Remember that he can be near to you while you're dancing
Though you've only just said hello
She's suddenly someone who can make all your daydreams appear to you
While you're dancing
Make the music weave a spell
Whirl away your worry
Things look almost twice as well
When they're slightly blurry
As around and around you go
Your spirits will hit the top
And now that we're dancing who cares if we ever stop?
One, two, three. One, two, three.
One, two, three. One, two, three
And now that we're dancing who cares if we ever stop?
Dolly!
Dolly, Cornelius is taking us to see the parade. Everyone will be marching.
- Come on, Mrs. Levi.
- Dolly, the world is full of wonderful things.
Hurry, before the parade passes by!
Yes, I will. I will.
Before the parade passes by.
Before it all moves on
And only I'm left
Before the parade passes by
I've got to get in step
While there's still time left
I'm ready to move out in front
Life without life has no reason or rhyme left
With the rest of them
With the best of them
I wanna hold my head up high
I need a goal again
I need a drive again
I wanna feel my heart coming alive again
Before the parade
Passes by
Ephraim, let me go.
It's been long enough, Ephraim.
Every night, just like you'd want me to, I've put out the cat, made myself a rum toddy, and, before I went to bed, said a little prayer thanking God that I was independent.
That no one else's life was mixed up with mine.
But lately, Ephraim,
I've begun to realise that for a long time I have not shed one tear.
Nor have I been for one moment outrageously happy.
Now, Horace Vandergelder, he's always saying the world is full of fools.
And in a way, he's right, isn't he?
I mean, himself, Cornelius, Irene, myself...
But there comes a time when you've got to decide if you want to be a fool among fools, or a fool alone.
Well, I have made that decision, Ephraim, but I would feel so much better about it if... if you could just give me a sign, any kind of a sign that you approve.
I'm going back, Ephraim.
I've decided to join the human race again.
And, Ephraim, I want you to give me away.
Before the parade passes by
I've got to go and taste Saturday's high life
Before the parade passes by
I've got to get some life back into my life
I'm ready to move out in front
I've had enough of just passing by life
With the rest of them
With the best of them
I can hold my head up high
For I've got a goal again
I've got a drive again
I'm gonna feel my heart coming alive again
Before the parade
Passes by
Waah! Waah!
Present arms!
Present arms!
Dolly Levi!
Hi!
Gussie Granger?
What are you doing here?
Earning an honest dollar, which is more than I've made on a legitimate stage in two years.
Pity on you. But the meat packers' float?
Ha! Listen, if there was more money in it, I'd play one of the pigs.
I came here for some privacy.
I owe you an apology and I didn't want to let it go another minute.
You owe me the fee I gave you for getting me tangled up with that collector of men's hats.
Yes, Irene, she was a disappointment, darling girl.
I'll have you know the confectioner gave me back every cent for the peanuts.
I'm sorry. I never give cash refunds.
However, being a woman who believes in giving service that's been paid for,
- I've arranged to make it up to you.
- Let me make one thing clear.
You have been discharged as my marriage broker. I have no use for one.
From now on, you are just a woman like anyone else.
- I am?
- And I'm just a man like anyone else, and, like anyone else, I'll do what I can to avoid the introductions you specialise in.
Well, I can understand your feelings, and I am here today, marching beside you, to assure you that there will be no further need for my services after dinner tonight.
- Dinner?
- 7. 30 at the Harmonia Gardens.
It's all arranged.
Private room. She'll be waiting.
- Who? Who-who-who'll be waiting?
- Who-who-who'll be waiting?
The very rich, very beautiful lady I referred to when I saw you in Yonkers this morning.
The heiress to a fortune, remember?
I'm not interested. What's her name?
Uh... Ernestina.
I'm not interested. What's her last name?
Simple... uh, Simple. Ernestina Simple.
- Can she cook?
- Can she cook?
Frankly, I never understood why a girl who could afford every servant around makes all her own meals, on a solid gold stove.
- She's a fool. I'm not interested in fools.
- Neither am I. Good day.
- Good day.
- Don't forget. 7. 30, Harmonia Gardens.
And rent some evening clothes. She's fussy.
Dolly Levi, you are a damned exasperating woman!
Why, Horace Vandergelder, that is the nicest thing you have ever said to me.
When the parade passes by
Listen and hear that brass harmony growing
When the parade passes by
Pardon me if my old spirit is showing
All of those lights over there
Seem to be telling me where I'm going
When the whistles blow
And the cymbals crash
And the sparklers light the sky
I'm gonna raise the roof
I'm gonna carry on
Give me an old trombone
Give me an old baton
Before the parade
Passes by
Cornelius, are you sure they're just changing their clothes?
- Don't worry, they'll be here.
- I get dressed in less than three minutes.
- Women wear more.
- They do?
Underneath.
Cornelius, maybe we should leave while there's time.
- Never.
- We've seen everything.
The parade, the Statue of Liberty, the stuffed whale at Barnum's museum.
- I could die a happy man now.
- It'll be worth it, no matter what happens.
The worst anybody can do is put us in jail.
But as long as we live we'll never forget the night we took Irene Molloy and
Minnie Fay to dinner at Harmonia Gardens,
- on less than a dollar.
- Cornelius, wake up.
And there's another reason we can't go back.
One more thing we promised to do before we go and turn into a couple of Vandergelders.
Cornelius! You're not thinking of kissing Miss Molloy?
- Maybe.
- She'll scream.
Barnaby, you don't know anything about women.
- Only that we can't afford 'em.
- You should know that everyone except us goes through life kissing right and left all the time.
They do?
Yes.
I often wondered about that.
- Smile, Barnaby.
- I'm smiling.
- Look rich and gay and charming.
- I'm looking gay and charming.
Hello.
- Here we are.
- Hello.
Cornelius.
Haa... I'm pleased to meet you, Miss Molloy.
No last names. After all we've been through together this afternoon, it's Irene and Minnie.
Irene.
- Ohh...
- Ohhh...
- Does that count, Cornelius?
- I don't think so.
Count?
You see, we were counting here, while we were waiting.
I hear all rich people do nothing but count their money.
I'm so hungry. Why don't we go in here and have some hors d'oeuvres first?
- No, no, no.
- It's very fashionable.
- It would spoil our appetites.
- Or we could have an apéritif.
It's out of the question. Barnaby and I don't agree with that sort of thing.
- But all those people do.
- Well, they simply don't know that a...
...a... péritif is no longer considered elegant.
- Oh, it isn't?
- Hasn't been for years.
In that case, it's on to Harmonia
Gardens for dinner. Call a hack.
- Hack?
- All my life I've wanted to ride in a hack.
- Oh, there's one. Yoo-hoo!
- No, no. We can't do that.
I mean, it isn't the money or anything it's just that, nowadays, really elegant people never take hacks.
- Hacks is out.
- They all go by streetcar.
Then, by all means, we go by streetcar.
I've been elegant all my life and I never knew it.
Of course, if you really want to be really elegant...
- Oh, we do.
- We do.
You'll walk.
Yes, New York
Barnaby and Cornelius
All the guests of Mr. Hackl are feeling great and look spectacular
What a knack
There is to that acting like a born aristocrat
We got elegance
If you ain't got elegance
You can never, ever carry it off
All who are well-bred agree
Minnie Fay has pedigree
Exercise your wildest whims tonight
We are out with Diamond Jims tonight
Could they be misleading us?
Silver spoons were used for feeding us
We got elegance
If you ain't got elegance
You can never, ever carry it off
Snobs that slobs
Throw roses at. We look down
Our noses at
Pity all the other girls around
When I swing my perfect pearls around
Snubbing folks is chic to us
Sometimes we don't even speak to us
If you ain't got elegance
You can never, ever carry it off
If you please.
Middle class don't speak of it
Savoir-faire, we reek of it
Some were born with rags and patches
But we use dollar bills for matches and
Vanderbilt kowtows to us
JP Morgan scrapes and bows to us
We got elegance
We were born with elegance
I behave like Walter Raleigh
When the streets are full of mud
And the bluest huckleberry
Isn't bluer than my blood
Have you noticed when I hold my cup
The saucer never moves
And the way I keep my pinkie up
Indubitably proves that
We got elegance
We got built-in elegance
And with elegance
Elegance, elegance, elegance
Elegance
We'll carry it off
Horace, Horace Vandergelder
Mrs. Horace Vandergelder
Just leave everything to me
Though it won't be like the first time
How can it be like the first time?
But why does it have to be?
Don't look for shooting stars
For love is only love
You touch, and still you touch the ground
Don't listen for those bells
For love is only love
And if it's love you've found
Your heart won't hear a sound
And when you hold his hand
You only hold his hand
The violins are all a bluff
But if you're really wise
The silence of his eyes
Will tell you love is only love
And it's wonderful enough
Without the shooting stars
Without the sound of bells
Without the violins
Love is wonderful
Enough
Good evening. Good evening.
Straighten up. Walk erect.
Pleasure. Good evening.
How nice to see you.
Psst! No expression. Let the food smile.
And how are you this evening?
Charming, charming.
You! You there!
Come up here at once.
Yes, you.
How dare you keep me standing here this long?
As soon as Mr. Vandergelder arrives, you will be seated, Miss Simple.
Now look here, garçon.
My name is Rudolph. Rudolph Reisenweber.
And why, may I ask, can I not wait at the table?
Please. Please.
Harmonia Gardens does not consider it proper, a lady alone.
- Perhaps if you'll let me take your wrap.
- Ohh! Don't touch me.
Where?
- If you will excuse me.
- Certainly not.
Yes? What can I do for you?
How are ya, Adolf? How's my old friend?
- I am Rudolph.
- Oh, of course.
Rudolph.
We'd like a little something to eat. You know?
In what name is the reservation, please?
- Reservation?
- I'm afraid there is nothing available.
- Come on, let's go.
- Do you know who he is?
This is Cornelius Hackl. The Cornelius Hackl.
- Tell him about the Rockefellers.
- The Rockefellers? I see.
Look, I know a little place up the block.
I think I have something. Yes, I think
I have something. Follow me, if you will.
Dining room number two.
- It is the last one. Very private.
- It is?
- Very exclusive.
- It is?
- Very fashionable.
- Don't say another word.
And very expensive.
That was the word.
- How beautiful!
- How elegant!
How much?
Cornelius, I thought you said everyone knew you.
Oh, don't worry. They will after tonight.
She is? She is? I don't believe it!
Eight o'clock, table for two, and a chicken.
Mrs. Dolly Levi coming here after such a long absence!
It is too happy to be true.
That's the message she told me to give you.
Who? Who are these people?
They look truthful.
If you're gonna spend all evening acting like a scared rabbit, maybe I'll order lettuce.
Oh, how can you be so brave? It's unfair.
Just try to keep remembering
Mrs. Levi's advice.
I only wanted to marry you, not perform in public.
- There's nobody here who knows us.
- Oh, Ambrose, are you sure?
Sweetheart, have I ever been wrong?
Sir?
- Vandergelder's the name.
- Yes, Mr. Vandergelder.
There's a Miss Ernestina Simple supposed to be waiting.
Right there, Mr. Vandergelder.
No, you didn't understand what I said...
But perfectly. Mr. Vandergelder is here, Miss Simple.
Yes, so I see.
- Oh, good evening, Miss Simple.
- I hope so, Mr. Vandergelder.
- All right, my good man.
- Fritz, private dining room number one.
- Follow me, if you will.
- You may take my arm.
And, unless you are suffering from a head cold, kindly remove your hat.
Achtung!
I have an important announcement to make.
After an absence of several years, there will return to the Harmonia Gardens tonight the lady who always had the happiest smile, the warmest heart, and the largest appetite in the city of New York.
- It's Dolly.
- Dolly?
- Dolly!
-  Dolly! Dolly! Dolly! Dolly! Dolly!
Attention!
It is therefore my order, as head waiter of the Harmonia Gardens, and your supreme commander, that tonight of all nights our usual lightning service will be twice as lightning as ever.
Or else!
Waiter, write this down. Mock turtle soup, roast pheasant under glass.
- Pheasant?
- I'll have the same, and some champagne.
- Champagne?
- What would you like, sir?
Six months off for good behaviour?
What do you mean,
"oysters aren't in season"?
Anybody can have oysters in season.
I want them out of season.
They don't have any, Miss Simple.
Then tell 'em to go out and dig for some.
Oh!
- Hello again.
- Here we are.
- We thought something happened.
- Don't worry. It will.
Barnaby, Irene, Minnie,
I feel so good about everything, so good about this whole day, that I am now going to become an honest man and tell the truth.
Cornelius?
I'd forgotten what strange things happen to men when they drink.
If I tell you the truth, will you let me put my arm around your waist?
Good heavens! You can do that even if you lie to me.
I've never touched a woman before.
You still haven't. That's my corset.
- You're a wonderful person, Irene.
- Thank you, Cornelius.
And that's why I have to tell you the truth.
If it'll make you feel better.
It's all those fancy things that Mrs. Levi said about me.
Oh, yes.
Well, they're just not so.
Indeed?
Irene, I'm not rich.
Not rich?
I'm not any of the things
Mrs. Levi said I was.
And neither is Barnaby. We're not sports, we don't know anybody.
We never come to New York.
We never do anything except work for Mr. Vandergelder all day and clean up the store at night.
And we wanted so much to have one day of adventure, that we ran away from Yonkers and told a lot of lies.
Ah, well, look at us.
A pair of penniless pretenders.
But, Cornelius, I've known that all along.
You have?
Why else would you have hidden in my cupboard and under my table?
And made us walk all over New York?
You're the nicest ladies a man ever went to jail for.
Jail?
We don't have the money to pay for this dinner.
Of course you don't. Minnie, show these two sports what I've got in my purse.
What a pleasure to know that selling all those silly hats can pay for an evening as delightful as this one.
I can't help myself.
Wow!
I...
No, no, Minnie, my white handbag, not that one.
- My white handbag.
- When we changed for the evening.
Minnie...
Only my mad money... a nickel for the horsecar.
Would you like your check now, sir?
Take this away, my good man.
Bring us another bottle of champagne.
- What's this? What are you doing?
- It's eight o'clock. I really must be going.
Going? You haven't finished your dinner yet, Miss Simple.
That's expensive.
If I had food like that every night,
I'd be out of business inside a year.
I suggest you have the waiter put it in a bag and take it home to your horses and pigs.
I don't have pigs, Miss Simple,
I have chickens, and I did not get them by being extravagant.
I see no point in this trivial discussion, Mr. Vandergelder, nor in my remaining here any longer, inasmuch as it is quite clear to me that you are, if you forgive the expression,
- entirely unsuitable.
- Unsuitable?
Nevertheless, I will never say a word to
Mrs. Levi about this unfortunate evening.
And I suggest you do likewise when she arrives here.
Wait a minute.
Did you say "arrives here"?
Yes, she planned to join us at eight.
You may say I left because I felt sick to my stomach.
It's quite true, you know.
Good night.
Any man who goes to a big city deserves what happens to him.
- He's all yours, honey.
- Good. Mr. Cassidy?
- Yes, Mrs. Levi?
- It's all right now. You can let me out.
Whoa.
- Mr. Reisenweber, come here! Hurry!
- How often have I told you not to shout?
- It's her. She's outside.
- You mean...?
- What's going on?
- Are you sure?
I know that voice. I heard her.
In a beautiful carriage with two horses.
- That's her. She's come.
- Who? Who's come?
A lady. You wouldn't know her. Mrs. Levi.
- Is it true?
- Yes, it's Dolly. Tell the men to get ready.
- You saw her?
- In a long carriage pulled by four horses.
It's like old times.
Reisenweber. Rudolph!
Rudy!
She is here.
Hello, Rudy
Well, hello, Harry
It's so nice to be back home where I belong
You are lookin' swell, Manny
I can tell, Danny
You're still glowin', you're still crowin'
You're still
Mmm.
Goin' strong
I feel the room swayin'
For the band's playin'
One of my old favourite songs from way back when
So
Bridge that gap, fellas
Find me an empty lap, fellas
Dolly'll never go away again
Hello, Dolly
Well, hello, Dolly
It's so nice to have you back where you belong

For the band's playin'
One of your old favourite songs from way back when
So
Here's my hat, fellas
I'm stayin' where I'm at, fellas
Promise you'll never go away again
I went away from the lights of 14th Street
And into my personal haze
But now that I'm back in the lights of 14th Street
Tomorrow will be brighter than the good old days
Those good old days
Tell it to me sweet
Hello! Well, hello, Dolly
Well, hello! Hey, look! Here's Dolly
Glad to see you, Hank, let's thank my lucky star
Your lucky star
You're lookin' great, Stanley
Lose some weight?
I think, I think you did, Stanley
Dolly's overjoyed and overwhelmed and...
Over par
I hear the ice
Do you hear the ice tinkle?
See the lights
Can you see the light twinkle?
And you still get glances from us handsome men
Look at you all, you're all so handsome
Golly, gee, fellas
Find me an empty knee, fellas
Dolly'll never go away again
Well, hello
Look who's here.
Dolly
This is Louis
Hello, Louis.
Dolly
It's so nice to have you back where you belong
I am so glad to be back.
Ah, you're lookin' swell
Thank you, Louis.
Dolly
I can tell
Does it show?
Dolly
You still glowin', you still crowin'
You still goin' strong
I feel the room swayin'
And the band playin'
One of our old favourite songs from way back when
I remember it
- So
- It was my favourite
Show some snap, fellas
Find her an empty lap, yeah
Dolly'll never go away again
Well, well, hello, Dolly
Well, hello, Dolly
It's so nice to have you back where you belong
You're lookin' swell, Dolly
We can tell, Dolly
You're still glowin', you're still crowin'
You're still goin' strong
I hear the ice
I hear it tinkle
See the lights
I see them twinkle
And you still get glances from us handsome men
So
Mmm, wow, wow, wow, fellas
Look at the old girl now, fellas
Dolly'll never go away
Dolly'll never go away
Dolly'll never go away again
One more time!
Dolly'll never go away
Dolly'll never go away
Dolly'll never...
Horace Vandergelder.
- Do we know each other?
- Much too well.
Oh, it's you, Mrs. Levi.
Yes.
Well, do you, uh...?
Do you think you have the figure for that sort of get-up?
That's for others to say, Mr. Vandergelder.
I bought it from a friend, not being a rich lady who has nothing better to do than dilly-dally with seamstresses.
- Which reminds me. Where is Miss Simple?
- Miss Simple? Well, she had to... uh... uh...
She got called away by a sick friend. Had to leave.
Oh. Well, that's Ernestina.
Always thinking of other people.
We'll just have to make do without her for the time being. Rudolph?
My dear Mrs. Levi, I have saved the very best table for you.
- How I've missed you.
- This way, please.
- Come along.
- I've eaten.
Don't stand here, you'll get run over by a waiter. Oh, hello. Good evening.
Oh, hello. How are you?
Hi, nice to see you.
- You know too many people.
- Total strangers.
- So why greet them?
- It feels good to have so many friends.
- Well, say hello for me too.
- I already did.
- Lovely, Rudolph. Perfect.
- What are we doing down here?
There's someone in the dance competition I want you to see.
- I have no interest in dancing.
- Rudy, this is Mr. Vandergelder of Yonkers.
In fact, Yonkers' most influential citizen.
And Mr. Vandergelder insists on buying the finest dinner you have and served promptly.
- I never said that.
- I'm watching my waist. Can't eat a thing.
- What's ready immediately?
- You ordered a chicken...
I couldn't face a chicken.
Not after all I've been through today.
- Good, cancel the chicken.
- And bring a turkey.
- Yes.
- With everything on the side.
Now, tell me about you and Ernestina.
I can't wait to hear.
It was short, but was it sweet?
I mean, do you think you and she...?
I mean, did it go well?
Mrs. Levi, you've a habit of asking very personal questions.
Mr. Vandergelder, if you're thinking of marriage, you might as well learn that you have to let women be women.
Now, tell me, did you like her?
Did she like you?
Always putting your nose into other people's affairs.
Anybody who lived with you would get as nervous as a cat.
- What did you say?
- Anybody who lived with you...
Horace Vandergelder, you get that idea right out of your head this minute.
Why, the idea of you even mentioning such a thing.
Understand once and for all that
I have no intention of marrying you.
- I didn't mean that.
- You've been hinting around for some time.
- I have not.
- So put that right out of your head.
- Stop saying that. That's not what I meant.
- I should hope not.
You go your way and I'll go mine.
I am not some Irene Molloy whose head you can turn with chocolate peanuts. Unshelled.
- The idea of you suggesting it.
- You misunderstood me.
I certainly hope so. Let's not discuss it any more. Here's our food.
- I don't feel well.
- I'll serve Mr. Vandergelder.
Here is a lovely, a lovely wing, for you.
And some dumplings.
Oh, lighter than air, they are.
- That's what I need, some air.
- And some giblets.
Very, very tender and very good for you.
No, as I said before, you go your way and I'll go mine.
Here, have some wine, you'll feel better.
Since you brought it up, there's one thing I oughta say...
- I didn't bring it up.
- before we forget about it.
It's true, I like to manage things, but not anything as disorderly as your household.
As out of control, as untidy. Oh, no,
Horace, you can do that for yourself.
- It is not out of control.
- Let's not say another word.
- Oh, have some beets.
- I'm not hungry and I don't like beets.
No, a complaining, quarrelsome, friendless soul like you is no sort of companion for me.
You salt your beets and I'll salt mine.
I won't say another word.
Besides, I'm not those things you said I am.
You're the only person that knows it.
No, Horace, I have decided to enjoy life.
You can find a housekeeper who'll cook for a dollar a day.
It can be done, if you like cold baked beans. I can see you now, ending your days listening at keyholes for fear of being cheated.
- Have some more beets. They're delicious.
- I hate beets.
There, that's the difference between us.
I'd be nagging you, to get some spirit into you, and the pity of it is you could be a charming, amiable man if you wanted to.
- I don't want to be charming.
- But you are. You can't help yourself.
Listening at keyholes! You have no right to say such things.
At your age you ought to enjoy the truth.
My age, you're always talking about my age.
I don't know what your age is, but with bad temper you'll double it in six months.
Now siddown. Before we change the subject, there's one thing I'll say.
I don't wanna hear it. You're wasting your time. I have no intention of proposing.
Oh! I suppose you want me to ask you?
Well, I'm sorry. I'm turning you down.
How can you turn me down when I haven't asked ya anything?
It's no use arguing. I've made up your mind.
Here, let me cut your wings.
- I don't want my wings cut.
- No man does, Horace. No man does.
I've got a headache. I'm leaving.
Oh, no, the dance competition is about to begin.
Ladies and gentlemen, if I may have your attention please.
It is my pleasure to announce on behalf of the management of the Harmonia Gardens, that our dance contest is about to commence.
The judges for tonight's competition are Mr. Hermann Fleishacker,
Mr. Llewellyn Codd, and our special guest-of-honour judge, Mrs. Dolly Levi.
Siddown!
Ladies and gentlemen who wish to participate, will you please come to the dance floor.
To the lucky winning couple goes the grand prize of 50 silver dollars or an engagement at the Harmonia Gardens.
Everybody, dance!
- Your check, sir.
- Another bottle of champagne.
Mm! Look at him. What grace, what talent, what a living he could earn with his feet!
- Horace, look.
- Where?
- Wait a minute.
- Oh, isn't he wonderful?
That's Ambrose Kemper, so-called artist.
- Why, so it is.
- No wonder his pictures are so awful.
- He must paint with his feet.
- He's sure to win first prize.
Ermengarde should see him now, dancing with another girl.
- And such a pretty little thing too.
- It's shameful, that's what it is. Shameful.
Look, there's that Molloy woman dancing with a man.
I think it's a man.
And only a few hours ago she was waiting for me to propose.
- Shocking.
- No faithfulness left in this world.
I agree. I certainly do. And it's very selfish that people like us don't jump right up and marry someone just to set the world a good example.
My hat!
Ermengarde!
- Uncle...
- My niece!
Agh!
You are a disgrace to Yonkers!
Grrrr!
- Mr. Vandergelder, the contest!
- I'll show you a contest!
Call the police!
Uncle Horace, we can explain.
Exp...? I'll give you...
Cornelius Hackl!
- What are you doing in New York?
- Delivering some oats.
Oats? With my former intended?
- You're discharged!
- You can't fire me. I quit.
So do I.
- And you're discharged!
- You can't fire me. I quit.
So do I.
I'm sorry.
Grrr!
Oh!
Horace Vandergelder, flat on your back you are still charming.
Cornelius, Barnaby, perhaps there's a way I can get
Mr. Vandergelder to give you back your jobs.
What? How?
I could become his wife.
- No, that's impossible.
- It is?
- Yes.
- But why, Cornelius?
- Because. That's why.
- But you have to give me a reason.
Never mind the reason. Never mind the reason! And don't tell me to shush!
- What's going on there?
- Cornelius, quick!
Hey, you! What's all this noise?
What's happening here?
- Now, you stay out of this.
- Are you all right, Miss?
- I'll let you know.
- Young man...
I'm only trying to tell her something.
Well, it's too late and you're disturbing the peace.
No, it's not too late.
That's why I'm shouting.
For 28 years, my whole life,
I never did anything.
I just worked, took orders, never went anywhere. Stayed in Yonkers.
- Yonkers?
- And today the most important thing that can happen to a man, and might never have happened, happened to me because I left Yonkers and came to New York and met this lady.
Met her this afternoon.
Mister... just what are you talking about?
Officer, I'm talking about none other than love.
-  Love?
- Love?
Young man, are you trying to tell me that after 28 years in Yonkers you've fallen in love with this young lady in one day?
Oh, no, Officer, I didn't fall in love with
Miss Irene Molloy of this city in just a day.
It was much quicker than that. An hour.
No, even that's too long.
What's less than a minute?
- A second?
- Less than that.
- A moment.
- That's it.
That is it. Now, all of you, listen to me.
Please.
It only takes a moment
For your eyes to meet, and then
Your heart knows
In a moment
You will never be alone again
I held her
For an instant
But my arms felt sure and strong
It only takes a moment
To be loved
A whole life long
Isn't the world full of wonderful things?
I have lost so many things.
My job, my future, everything that people think is important, but I don't care. Cos, even if I have to dig ditches for the rest of my life,
I shall be a ditch-digger who once had a wonderful day.
Mister, do you mind?
I came in late. Right after...
It only...
Takes a moment
But his arms felt sure and strong
It only takes a moment
He held me, for an instant
But his arms felt safe and strong
It only takes a moment
To be loved a whole life long
And that is all
That love's about
And we'll recall
When time runs out
That it only
Took a moment
To be loved a whole life long
Tell Rudolph not to worry about the damage.
Just send the bill to Vandergelder's
Hay and Feed Store, Yonkers, New York.
- There's your life for you.
- I don't want to hear about it.
Without niece, without bride, without clerks.
Look, I'm tired. I've got a backache.
- That's all you have. I hope you're satisfied.
- Never mind.
There's only one thing for me to say.
I've been meaning to say it all night.
If it's to ask me to marry you, Dolly Levi, never - not in a million years.
It wasn't that at all, Horace.
All I wanted to say was...
Goodbye
What?
Goodbye
What are you talking about?
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye
- Nonsense.
- Don't try to stop me, Horace, please.
Wave your little hand and whisper "So long, dearie"
You ain't gonna see me any more
And when you discover that your life is dreary
Don ' t you come a-knockin' at my door
Cos I'll be all dolled up and singin' that song
That says "You dog, I told you so"
So wave your little hand and whisper "So long, dearie"
Dearie should have said "So long" so long ago
Because you treated me so rotten and rough
I have had enough of feeling low
So wave your little hand and whisper "So long, dearie"
Dearie should have said "So long" so long ago
For I can hear that choo-choo calling me on to a fancy new address
Yes, I can hear that choo-choo calling me on, on board that Happiness Express
I'm gonna learn to dance and drink and smoke a cigarette
I'm going as far away from Yonkers as a girl can get
So
And on those cold winter nights, Horace,
you can snuggle up to your cash register.
It's a little lumpy, but it rings.
Don't come a-knockin', I'll be all dolled up and singin' that song
That says "You dog, I told you so"
So, Horace, you will find your life a sad old story
You'll be living in that lonesome territory
When you see old Dolly shuffle off to glory
Oh, I should have said "So long"
How could I have been wrong?
Oh, I should have said "So long"
So long ago
Quiet! Quiet, down there, you little monsters.
Cornelius! Barnaby!
D'ya hear me down there?
Ermengarde!
What the devil is this?
What's this chicken mash doing all over?
Cornelius! Barnaby!
Get up here this minute and clean up this mess.
Well, good riddance. Didn't need you before and I don't need you now.
Ermengarde! I'm ready for my breakfast!
I want three eggs with crisp bacon, and hot porridge with cream, and grits...
It's not fair.
It's worse than that. It's lonely.
Not in a million years, Dolly Levi.
You go your way and I'll go mine.
- Good morning, Uncle Horace.
- Good morning, Mr. Vandergelder.
Oh, come crawling back, have you?
I've a good mind not to take you, but as I'm so softhearted go get your aprons and start cleaning up this mess.
We're not coming back to work for you.
What?
Barnaby and I are stopping by for our money.
You see, we've decided to go into business.
Business?
And since the only business we know is hay and feed, we're opening our own store.
Mrs. Levi's found the perfect location for us.
- Right across the street from you.
- She wouldn't dare.
Hackl and Tucker Incorporated.
H uh! You'll last for a week.
- What about my breakfast?
- Uncle Horace,
I think you'd better start learning how to make it yourself.
All right, all right. My conscience is clear.
A man can do only so much to keep fools from their own natural folly.
Why, Horace Vandergelder, as I live and breathe, how well you look today.
I just came by to return your cane, so don't let me interrupt.
You were doing something?
What were you doing?
We were getting their money.
- Plus $6. 12 of mine.
- And the money my mama left me.
That's right. $52.48.
- 38, idiot.
- 48... Uncle.
All right, all right. If all you can think about at a time like this is money, the safe is upstairs.
And I have the combination.
- You stay here.
- If you insist, Horace.
Ephraim Levi, I'm gonna get married again.
I'm gonna marry Horace Vandergelder.
And I'm asking your permission.
It won't be a marriage in the sense that we had one, but I shall certainly make him happy.
You can be sure of that.
I am going to marry Horace Vandergelder and send his money out into the world, doing all the things you taught me.
As you always used to say, Ephraim:
"Money, pardon the expression, is like manure."
"It's not worth a thing unless it's spread around, encouraging young things to grow."
Anyhow, that's the opinion of the future Mrs. Vandergelder.
And, Ephraim, I'm still waiting for that sign that you approve.
- Mr. Vandergelder.
- Outside. Front and back.
Bossy, scheming, meddling, irritating, inquisitive, exasperating.
Horace, I know you're no longer interested, but I have found you the ideal wife.
Dolly Levi, I don't want you to find me any ideal wife.
If I want an ideal wife,
I'll find one of my own, and I have found her and it's you, damn it!
I know I've been a fool and I probably always will be, but Dolly, forgive me and marry me.
No, Horace, I...
- I don't dare. I don't dare.
- What do you mean?
Well, you know as well as I do that you're the first citizen of Yonkers and your wife would have to be a... a somebody.
You are! You are a wonderful woman.
Yes, but, uh, do you really think I have it in me... to forgo fancy clothes and expensive jewels, and instead be a benefactress to half the town?
In other words, to be a credit to you?
Dolly, everybody knows that you could do anything you wanted to do.
By the way, Horace, here's the money
I borrowed from you yesterday.
Keep it, keep it.
Oh, Horace.
I never thought I'd ever hear you say anything like that.
You know it's bad business to let 'em open a store over there?
- It was your idea.
- Let him be your partner.
And Barnaby can have Cornelius's old job.
That way we can all dance at Ermengarde's wedding.
That does it. You've gone too far. I'll dance at no wedding. Besides, I don't know how.
- All right, I'll dance.
- Excuse me, Mr. Vandergelder.
- I said outside! Now get moving.
- Horace, what is going on around here?
Oh, nothing, I just thought I'd have the shutters done over in forest green.
- Forest-green shutters?
- The paint's still good, but that fellow's just set up a business and needs a good start.
You see, Dolly, I've always felt that money, pardon the expression, is like manure.
It's not worth a thing unless it's spread around, encouraging young things to grow.
Thank you, Ephraim.
Hello, Dolly
Well, hello, Dolly
It's so nice to have you here where you belong
I never knew, Dolly
Without you, Dolly
Life was awfully flat and, more than that, was awfully wrong
Here's my hat, Horace
I'm stayin' where I'm at, Horace
Dolly'll never go away
Wonderful woman.
Again
Put on your Sunday clothes when you feel down and out
Strut down the street and have your picture took
Dressed like a dream your spirits seem to turn about
That Sunday shine is a certain sign
That you feel as fine as you look
Take the someone whose arms you're in
Hold on to her tight and spin
And one, two, three. One, two, three.
One, two, three, look!
I held her
For an instant
But my arms felt sure and strong
It only takes a moment
To be loved a whole life long
Yes, it takes a woman
A dainty woman
A sweetheart, a mistress, a wife
Oh, yes, it takes a woman
A fragile woman
To bring you the sweet things in life
Well, well, hello, Dolly
Well, hello, Dolly
It's so nice to have you back where you belong
You're lookin' swell, Dolly
We can tell, Dolly
You're still glowin', you're still crowin'
You're still goin' strong
Just see the crowd swayin'
While the band's playin'
One of your old favourite songs from way back when
So
Wow, wow, wow, fellas
Look at the old girl now, fellas
Dolly'll never go away
Dolly'll never go away
Dolly'll never go away
Again
Hannibal!
Hannibal, Missouri!
Hannibal!
Hannibal, Missouri!
- Hannibal! Hannibal, Missouri!
- Hang fast on the bow!
- Next stop, St. Louis!
- Make room for the Hannibal passengers!
Now get them barrels marked "Cairo" up here!
Now move that Vicksburg cargo aft!
Here you are, sir.
Thank you.
All right, now put them Memphis boxes top of the Natchez cargo!
Get a move on, now! Hurry up, or we'll be a day late into New Orleans.
Oh, Huck!
Huck! Huck Finn!
Oh, it's you, Jim.
The Widow Douglas wants you, Huck.
She got supper on the table.
Tell her I stowed away on the Natchez Queen...
...and I'll probably be going to South America.
I can't tell the widow a stretcher like that, Huck.
They got a river in South America, Jim, and it ain't even been charted yet.
They need folks to help them.
Course, I'll have to go down the river to New Orleans first.
Wouldn't that be the beatenest, Jim?
New Orleans.
Wouldn't be nothing but trouble.
You'll have enough of that if you don't get home. You and me both.
Tell the widow and Miss Watson you just couldn't find me, Jim.
It's gonna be dark soon, Huck.
Yep.
It's beginning to smell like evening.
You'll be safe at the widow's.
That's the one place your pap won't come.
Your pap, Huck, he's looking for you.
- It's best we go, Huck. Come on.
- All aboard for St. Louis!
I sure would like to be going somewheres.
Come on, Huck. Let's go.
All aboard for St. Louis!
- He's barefoot.
- Oh, dear. Huckleberry.
Well, sit down before your food gets cold.
He'll put his shoes on as soon as he's finished his supper.
Amanda, I am not my sister's keeper, as the good book sayeth...
...nor am I the keeper of my sister's house, but...
That's right, Sarah, you're not.
Well, I suppose you can expect no better...
...for a young'un whose poor mother is lying dead in the churchyard...
...and his father's lying drunk by the riverside.
That's not Huckleberry's fault, Sarah.
He's not responsible.
Dear Lord, we thank thee for this food...
...and for all thy blessings.
And we beg thee to shine thy light before this sinner...
...and make him stop running around town barefoot...
...eating like a pig and not going to school.
Let him see the wisdom of education...
That he will be able to get a good, steady job when he grows up...
...preferably Tilden's tobacco factory or perhaps even a bank...
...if thee see fit.
We pray that he'll become a good and honorable man...
So that when the knell of doom sounds, he won't have to burn forever...
...in the eternal fires of hell.
- Amen.
- Amen.
Amen.
Huckleberry!
You're smoking.
Well, I got my shoes on, though, ain't I?
Smoking is a mean practice.
And besides, it's not clean.
Yes'm.
I guess I just wasn't made to be saved or civilized.
Huckleberry, you must try.
If not for my sake, for Miss Watson's.
She worries about you.
About what will become of you when you grow up, and...
Miss Watson loves you,
Huckleberry.
She'd be very unhappy in heaven without you.
Now, then, it's time for a growing boy to be in bed.
Come along.
Pap.
Hello, Pap.
Store-bought shoes, huh?
Think you're a good deal of a big bug, don't you?
- Maybe I am, maybe I ain't.
- Don't you give me none of your lip!
- This yourn?
- Yep.
- Can you read it?
- Not so good as I should, Pap.
Don't you "Pap" me.
You ain't no son of mine, wearing store shoes and reading.
And writing too, probably.
Not hardly.
Putting on airs.
Your ma couldn't read nor write.
Her folks couldn't, mine neither.
And I can't, but you think you're better than your own pa, don't you?
What is it? What's the matter?
I was afraid it would be you,
Mr. Finn.
Oh, "Mr. Finn," is it?
Well, now, ain't that highfalutin?
So that's where he gets his uppity ways.
- My poor lamb.
- And his loving hugs and kisses too, I see.
She don't mean no harm by it, Pap.
It ain't right...
...a boy living softer than his own pa.
I gotta have somebody to work and help take care of me. I'm a sick man.
Of course, if l... If I had a bit of money for medicine and such...
...I wouldn't have no need of the young'un.
How much do you want?
- Five hundred dollars.
- Five...
- But I'm a poor woman, Mr. Finn.
- Well, the way I see it...
...you're a woman of property.
That nigger will fetch 500.
- Perhaps even more.
- She can't, Pap. She can't sell Jim.
It ain't fair. Please don't make her do that, Pap.
The reading and writing weren't enough.
That weren't devilish enough.
- You made the boy an abolitionist!
- I ain't no abolitionist.
You shut up! Get over there!
Now, you've got till sundown tomorrow, widow woman...
...and I get the 500 or I'm taking him out of these parts forever!
Now, you know where my shack's at down by the river.
I'll be waiting. Come on.
Where's the victuals?
You said you was gonna bring us some.
Always thinking of yourself.
Well, I ain't brung any.
All's I could do to afford this jug.
Your dang loving widow lady...
...she thinks more of that slave of hers than she does you.
I waited all day for her.
Stood right down there in the center of town...
...just so she wouldn't have to come traipsing all the way out here...
...but she never showed up.
They're trash, rotten trash, all of them.
The more I see of the human race, the less I wanna have to do with them.
I never got nothing...
...nothing but a cuss word or a toe of a boot.
I never had one piece of luck.
And your mother...
Your mother didn't care.
Nor you neither.
You killed her.
You killed her just getting born!
Poor man left with a squealing baby that's gotta be brung up, with no wife to help him.
You'd think Providence would throw a creature like me...
...a little helping hand now and again.
I got nothing.
Nothing but to sit here and wait for the Angel of Death to come and get me.
And nobody cares, not one damn soul!
I swear to God, I don't know how they stood it.
Pap.
I care about you, Pap.
Pap?
You!
You...
I know you.
You're the Angel of Death...
...come to get me...
...but I ain't gonna let you.
I'm gonna kill you.
You won't come for me no more!
Pap, I ain't the Angel of Death.
I'm only Huck. Please, Pap.
I'll kill you.
No! No, Pap! No!
Don't come no closer, Pap.
I kill you, then.
As soon as you're dead, everything will...
...be all right.
That's right, Pap.
If I was dead...
...everything would just be sweet as pie...
...especially for me.
So I reckon I'll have to kill myself.
Blood.
Huck!
Huck!
Huck!
Somebody got my son!
My son!
Murder!
They drowned my young'un!
Murder!
Hello, Jim.
Glory be.
You's a ghost!
I ain't a ghost, Jim.
But you's dead.
Your pap come running into town, yelling that robbers killed you.
Well, I tricked it up so Pap would think I was dead, but I ain't.
Here. Touch me.
Go ahead, touch me.
It sure was a good trick, eh, Jim?
Oh, Huck, that was smart.
You smart, all right.
Thank you, Jim.
What is you gonna do now?
I'm going someplace where they ain't ringing a bell to get up by or eat by...
...and another one to go to bed by.
New Orleans, probably. Have to go there first to get to South America.
Got a canoe hid over there in a cove.
I'm gonna take her and float down the Mississippi past St. Louis, Cairo...
Cairo? Illinois?
Then to the big river and right south to New Orleans.
This raft can float you there better than a canoe.
I catched her off the river.
She sure is a beaut, Jim.
She'd be better for sleeping and keeping out of the rain if she had a wigwam.
Yep, a nice dirt floor and she'd be high and dry.
Huck, I got skillets, cups, pans and knives and everything.
All we need is just a little luck.
Where was you going, Jim?
I run away from the Widow Douglas.
Jim.
Well, she was gonna sell me so she could pay your pap.
You go back to her, Jim. She owns you, and what's right's right.
Besides, you'll get caught for sure, a slave alone on a raft.
I'd be safe, I was with a white man.
Or a white boy, even.
I couldn't help a runaway slave, Jim.
Why, folks would say I was no better than a low-down abolitionist.
I know, Huck. I know.
To starboard!
Current must have took the boy's body down thataway.
- They's looking for your body.
- They're looking for my corpse, all right.
Put in to shore! That Negro slave that killed him is probably on one of these islands!
They think you killed me.
Of course you didn't, because I ain't dead.
You better get. Take the raft.
- What about you?
- I could go with you, Huck.
I was going down to Cairo, Illinois, to step across into free territory.
What do you take me for, Jim, helping a runaway slave?
That just wouldn't be right.
I'm sure they're on this one.
Put in to shore.
I'm sorry, Jim.
You know I can't take you and all that.
You just wanna do what's right.
I admire you for that.
Thanks, Jim.
And when they get here, don't you worry about them finding out you ain't dead.
They can whup me or beat me or whatever they want to do.
I won't tell them you's alive.
I promise.
Jumping Jehoshaphat!
You's the only one that knows, ain't you?
Especially your pap, Huck...
I won't tell him especially.
Pap.
As far as me talking in my sleep, I'll go off somewhere by myself so nobody'll hear me.
You talk in your sleep?
That's a bad thing I do, but not too much.
I gotta take you with me, Jim.
- That wouldn't be right.
- Don't matter when you got no choice.
Leaving you behind just wouldn't be smart.
Now, come on, Jim.
All right, boys, come on!
Please, Jim, come with me.
If you think that's a smart thing to do, whatever you say is smart.
All right, let's go.
You got an uncommon level head for a white boy.
Thank you, Jim.
Here. Give me the pole, Huck.
You just leave this to old Jim.
You take the sweep, and let's go.
All we got to do now is keep from getting caught.
Look at the birds, Huck.
Ain't they pretty?
- Lookie there.
- I'm sure hungry.
- Sure hope we catch something.
- Yeah.
Ain't that a farmer's place over there?
Jim, if you take something, planning on returning it...
...it ain't stealing, it's just borrowing, huh?
No, but I'd rather borrow something off the river. It ain't safe to go ashore.
- Are you hungry or ain't you?
- I'm hungry.
All right. Let's go, Jim.
Come on, Jim.
Your worship, shall we?
Nothing here.
Somebody's been here.
Ain't but these left.
All the other eggs left's got chickens round them.
Yeah, but we don't want a chicken, huh?
But Pap always says,
"Take a chicken when you get a chance.
If you don't want it, there's always somebody who does...
...and a good deed ain't never forgot."
There's one over there.
Get him. Get him.
All right, you no-good, horn-toed weasels...
...come out and take it like men!
I'm gonna count to three!
One, two, three!
Your name Grangerford?
No, sir. Abner Williams is my name.
This is my lawful manservant here.
- We're on our way to...
- Williams?
Ain't heard that name around these parts.
Well, that don't hardly seem possible.
Grangerfords!
- You a Shepherdson?
- I'm only a boy.
I'd kill you anyway if you was a Shepherdson.
What you want to do that for?
On account of the Grangerford-Shepherdson feud!
Now, don't tell me you don't know what a feud is.
Well, a feud is like this.
A man has a quarrel with another man, and he kills him.
Then the other man's brother kills him.
And then all the brothers on both sides joins in.
And then all the cousins chips in.
By and by, everybody's all killed off.
Then there ain't no more feud.
- Get out of here!
- Huck, this ain't no place for us...
...when folks don't even know why they's killing!
Hold on there!
You don't want me. I ain't a
Grangerford nor a Shepherdson.
- Don't matter. You're a chicken thief!
- Don't shoot, mister!
Let's get out of here!
Look, Jim.
Let's go.
- Y'all get away from our raft!
- Oh, no. No, no.
Extend the hand of welcome to our guest.
- Him too?
- Why, of course. He is our guest.
If I had my way,
I'd let the both of you drown.
Reckon you got it backwards about who's guests.
- This here's our raft.
- Yes, and these here's our eggs.
As one man of the world to another, do us the honor of accepting our hospitality.
- Sure would go good, all right.
- Yeah.
Eggs a la Creole.
A specialty at the Hotel Creole Grande in New Orleans.
You've stayed there often,
I suppose?
- No, I ain't. Not yet, anyhow.
- You got to.
It's the only hotel in the Colonies that knows how to see to a gentleman's comforts.
Bed down there the next time you're in New Orleans.
Yeah, I'll do that.
Have your manservant pole us out from shore.
The smell of this ambrosia will fetch every gourmet in the neighborhood.
Go ahead, Jim.
Eggs a la creole, a royal repast.
Delicious.
Well, we'll be in Pikesville by midday tomorrow.
We've got business in Pikesville...
...family business.
Perhaps you'd care to run your lamps over this.
We come across it in a local journal.
I ain't too good at newsprint.
"As Mr. Peter Wilks, leading citizen of Pikesville, is seriously ill...
...he has asked his two brothers
Harvey and William...
...clergymen of Sheffield, England...
...and their 13-year-old nephew Percy to come and help him run his business.
Mr. Peter Wilks has not seen his reverend brothers in 28 years."
I reckon that tells it all.
Excepting who's the reverends?
We's the reverends.
Who in blazes did you think the reverends was?
Then where's your nephew Percy?
We lost poor Percy crossing the great Pacific Ocean from England.
A nasty accident involving a shark.
But I do believe he's been reborn!
Percy!
My name ain't Percy.
With him along, folks will know we're bona fide relations.
We's going to Cairo.
Piddling little stopover wouldn't hurt you none.
- We'd be ever so much obliged.
- What do you want to go to Cairo for?
There ain't nothing there but runaway slaves and them that's hunting them.
We got business there.
Why, of course, they got business there.
What sort of business would it be?
Family business, just like yours.
Williams is my name. Abner Williams.
This here's my lawful manservant, Jim.
We're on our way to claim a land grant that was given to me by the government...
...all on account of my brother Ned got scalped by the Paiute Indians.
- That's the business?
- That's right.
You see, my folks was powerful rich before they was all killed off in a feud.
What's he talking about?
Why, he's talking about fallen grandeur.
Right, boy?
- Yes, sir.
- The saddest state mortal man can sink to.
- You should know about fallen grandeur.
- I should?
Let us introduce ourselves.
This here is none other than a great nobleman...
...cheated of his rightful title.
He, gents...
...is the duke of Bilgewater.
- A duke?
I am?
He was untimely ripped from his cradle and was tossed into the world...
...to fend for himself at the tender age of 1.
I was?
The tragedy has chased the facts from his mind.
Poor little child.
Royalty. It don't hardly seem possible.
Whoever said the truth is a stranger to fiction knew his apples, all right.
Take myself.
You heard of the lost dolphin, son to Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette?
- Of course.
- I reckoned you had. I am he.
I'd be on the throne right now if I hadn't been snaked out of my title by the Corsican.
What's he talking about?
Well, he's just saying that he's the king of France.
- You are?
- I am...
...if justice ever gets done.
What do you say, boy?
Join the royal party, and there'll be a sizable piece of change forthcoming...
...upwards of $60.
Sixty dollars!
We's going to Cairo.
You'd be wise to heed the royal whim.
- Unless you wanna swim to Cairo.
- We'd be suspicious...
...of a boy and a manservant that would turn down $60 in currency.
What do you say, boy?
The decision's all yours.
- Happy to be of service, your kingship.
- "Majesty" will do.
"Kingship" ain't for but state occasions.
Huck, is they English reverends or foreign highnesses?
I swear, Jim, what you don't know about royalty would fill a book.
What these highnesses are doing are one of the things they do most of.
It's called "traveling incognito."
On to Pikesville, Bilgie, and a little child shall lead them.
Monstrous big sky, ain't it, Jim?
Did you ever see so blamed many stars?
Makes you wonder where they all come from.
You reckon the moon could have laid them?
I seen a frog lay near that many eggs one time.
I think we got nothing but trouble here, Huck.
Dog it, Jim. You gotta look on the bright side of things.
We's having an adventure.
Besides, one thing I learned out of Pap:
The best way to get along with them kind is to let them think they got you fooled.
I never seen nobody for praying like you, Jim.
You can't pray too much, not when you is a sinner.
You know it, and the Lord knows it.
You ain't a sinner, Jim.
What sin have you sinned, except for running away from the widow?
I sin, Huck. I sin big.
I sin the baddest sin as any man ever did, black or white.
Fiddlesticks.
You know my little girl, my little Elizabeth?
One time, when she was about 4 years old...
...she had a rough spell with that scarlet fever, but thank goodness, she got well.
One day, we was standing around in the cabin, and the door was open.
I said to her,
"Shut the door, baby."
She didn't do it.
I tell her again, and she never move.
She just kept standing there...
...looking up at me kind of smiling-like.
I say, "I'm gonna teach you to mind your daddy," and I fetch her a slap...
...across the side of her head that sent her sprawling.
And I stepped outside just to kind of cool off a little bit...
...and come back about 10 minutes later, and the door was still open.
The child was almost right in it...
...looking down at the floor and just moaning...
...and the tears were just rolling down her cheeks.
I was mad, and just as I started for her...
...along come a wind and shut the door:
Ka-blam!
And the child, she never move.
She didn't even budge.
Huck, she was stone-deaf.
Deaf and dumb from that scarlet fever, and I had been treating her so.
I bust out crying.
I grabbed her up in my arms and prayed,
"God Almighty, forgive me...
...because I can't forgive myself."
Huck, the Lord knows what kind of sinner I is.
He knows I don't deserve nothing but trouble.
Prosperous-looking village.
The leading citizen of such a town must be rich...
...beyond the avaricious dreams of Croesus himself.
Rich folks is suspicious.
Might just be a good idea to get a few facts on dear Peter Wilks.
- How you gonna do that, Your Majesty?
- Why, same way you get facts anywhere:
From the town barber.
You need a shave anyway,
Your Majesty.
Ain't he the beatenest?
"Runaway slave wanted for murder.
Reward $200."
A young'un by the name of Huckleberry Finn...
...was killed up Hannibal way, cut up and drowned in the river.
Next day, the slave run off.
Poor little chap.
Weren't no older than you are.
Yeah, poor little chap.
Mammy and Pappy must be sorrowing fit to bust.
Yeah, especially his pap.
Runaway slave answers to the name of Jim.
That's your name, ain't it?
Oh, but the slave they're looking for...
...well, he killed a young'un no older than me.
So it couldn't have been Jim...
...because I ain't dead.
Here. Touch me.
Go ahead, touch me.
Touch him. Touch him.
There he is now.
Whatever he tells you to do, you do.
I appreciate your help in this matter.
Allow me to introduce the leading tonsorial wizard of this fair metropolis.
My brother, the Reverend William Wilks...
...our nephew Percy, and that there is our loyal manservant.
You're the one that's afflicted, ain't you?
- Beg pardon?
- The one that's deaf and dumb.
- Deaf and dumb?
- Since birth.
Mr. Peter Wilks told us all about his poor brother William.
Deaf and dumb?
Deaf and dumb.
Now, if your worship will excuse me,
I'll go tell...
What does he...?
Have you heard? The Reverend Wilks and his brother just arrived from England.
From now on, Bilgewater, the hand is quicker than the eye.
Our nieces Mary Jane and Joanna will be expecting us.
Poor fatherless waifs.
The Reverend Wilks and his brother arrived from England.
Dear Peter Wilks give up the ghost at 10 p.m. Last night.
A God-fearing man, who prayed on going to bed...
...getting up at noon every day of his life.
Miss Watson will sure run into him in heaven, all right.
Our dear, sweet nieces got nobody to turn to except their loving uncles...
...and, of course, their cousin Percy.
Here they come now,
Miss Mary Jane.
Oh, Joanna, our prayers have been answered.
Our dear uncles are here.
They're here. They're here.
Them two don't look like any reverends I ever seen.
This is it.
- By Jove, you must be Mary Jane.
- Uncle Harvey!
Mary Jane!
You're a grown young lady.
The very image of my dear brother.
Oh, Mary Jane.
Mary Jane, your uncles are here.
Hello.
Oh, Joanna, isn't this glorious?
Look at Percy.
He ain't even wearing shoes.
River pirates. They picked us clean...
...and stole the ecclesiastical yawl...
...a one master lent us for the journey upriver by the bishop of New Orleans...
...a dandy chap.
He's gotta put shoes on before he can be any kinfolk of mine.
Oh, Uncle Harvey...
...if you only could have arrived yesterday...
...before Father...
Alas! Alas! After 28 years, to have missed him by a hair.
Your Uncle William got a fierce yen to see the dear departed.
Artheline. Artheline.
See that their manservant has food and a place to sleep.
This way.
Blessings on you, citizens.
Percy, this is your home.
Hold on there, my dear.
Your Uncle William and me was on our way from England...
...to the deepest jungles of Patagonia for the purpose of converting the heathen there.
We're loaded with legal tender collected from our congregation...
...and what's ours is yours.
No, I insist, my dear.
The heathens can wait.
As the bard said,
"Blood is thicker than holy water."
But, Uncle Harvey, Father left us rich.
We've this house and a prosperous tannery business and $3000 in gold.
Hallelujah.
And he left $3000 in gold to you and Uncle William.
That ain't important.
All that counts is that you two sweet things is provided for.
- Father's in there.
- Yes.
We must thank our dear brother personal.
Percy?
Yes, sir.
What's the matter, Percy?
You scared?
Nope, but...
I reckon it'd just be too sad a sight for a boy my age.
I'd best look after Jim.
Yes, do so instanter.
Too late.
Alas! Too late!
Percy?
You're in an awful fret about that manservant of yours, ain't you?
Afraid he'll run off?
Jim? Why, he's the loyalest slave a body ever had.
Come along with me, Percy.
Well, come on.
All right. All right.
See that? That's a history book.
I read it, and it says they don't have slaves in England no more.
Well, we didn't get him in England.
We picked him up off some desert island, coming across the ocean.
Desert island? In the Atlantic?
The Pacific.
We come across the Pacific.
This here's a geography book.
I read it too.
The Atlantic is the only ocean between here and England.
I say, Joanna, old girl, who you gonna believe?
Some old geography book or a chap that's from there, by Jove?
Come along with me, Percy.
Well, come on.
This here's a Bible.
I keep it handy for making folks swear on it when I think they're telling stretchers.
Now put your hand on it and swear you ain't.
And don't tell me they use a different kind of Bible in England.
Come on.
Father's last wish was to see you and Uncle William.
That he was denied...
...but his last request will be fulfilled.
Then I know he'll rest in peace.
Don't give them the gold, Mary Jane.
Please don't. That'd be wrong.
No, Joanna's right.
This ain't no time for filthy lucre.
The very sight of that $3000 would sicken your Uncle William and me...
...but we can't be selfish.
Our dear brother's last request comes first. Open the box.
Let me help you with that.
I'll take care of this, my dear.
May his soul rest in peace.
This will turn many a Patagonian heathen on to the glory road.
Uncle Harvey, I wish I had the goodness of character...
...to sell the house and the tannery and apply the money in your noble works.
No, my dear. No, I can't allow it.
You and Joanna got to be took care of.
Unless, of course, you'd see fit to accept the hospitality of loving kinfolk...
...and join your Uncle William and me in merry old.
- England?
- There's a spare room in the rectory.
Oh, Joanna, think of it. To go to England and live with our dear uncles.
- Well, I ain't going.
- Joanna!
I don't mean to get ate by sharks, crossing the Pacific Ocean.
- Who was it told you about sharks, Joanna?
- Percy did.
He says you crossed the Pacific Ocean from
England, and I know there's sharks there.
Percy was mistaken. One crosses the Atlantic from England.
I knew it!
I knew he was telling stretchers.
Boy, you ain't Percy.
You're a fraud and an impostor!
And if you're a fraud and impostor, so are they!
- Now, see here, Joanna...
- Joanna, they can't be impostors.
They're clergymen.
All right, don't believe me.
I'm just a girl, but I ain't a dumb bunny.
I'm gonna get that sheriff.
He'll know whether they're frauds or impostors or not.
And he ain't a girl, so maybe you'll take his word for it.
Hallelujah.
Joanna, he's praying for you.
I'm just doing what we do every day at home in England...
...praying at the stroke of noon, like Uncle Peter wrote us he done.
Hallelujah.
The boy's a genius.
Joanna, how could you mistrust such a pious, God-fearing boy?
- I don't believe it!
- Joanna!
- Oh, Uncle Harvey.
- Amen.
There, there, my dear.
Things will be much better back home at the rectory.
- Oh, how good you are.
- Yes.
We'll leave soon as you get rid of the tannery and sell the house.
Tomorrow. After the funeral.
As soon as possible.
Just leave all them little, picky details to me.
How lucky we are to have such wonderful uncles.
Yes, yes, yes, my dear.
Oh, and poor little Percy.
How unhappy you must be in those awful rags and barefooted.
Come, let me take care of you.
I'll fix you all up.
- I have some clothes upstairs that'll fit you.
- The dear departed.
Jim.
Jim!
- Huck, honey.
- Come on.
What in the world happened to you?
Uncle Peter's coat and these shoes.
I can't stand it, Jim.
We gotta get.
Now, you go to the raft and float her a half-mile downstream and wait for me.
Besides, it's beginning to smell like trouble.
That Joanna, she's got her heart set on sniffing out royalty.
If she brings that sheriff around, he'll think you're that slave they're looking for.
Well, I is, ain't I?
Of course. That's why we can't take no chances.
It's fine of you to help me keep from getting caught...
...even if folks would say you're a low-down abolitionist for doing it.
Now, lookie here, Jim.
If the royalty gets caught for stealing that gold from them poor girls...
...I want folks to know that you and me had nothing to do with it.
And the only way we can do that is to hide the gold so it won't get stole.
Now, you go down to the raft, do you hear?
And I'll hide the gold. Get.
Where's the loot?
A profitable day's work, Regulus, and there'll be more where that come from.
It's almost too easy.
When you got all the fools in town on your side, that's a big enough majority anywheres.
You know, there's another 200 just asking to be picked up.
That slave of the young'un's, answers to Jim...
...just like that runaway they're looking for?
No. No, the kid wouldn't take to that kindly.
It'd be cutting off our noses to turn him against us. Yeah.
The way he saved our lives with that praying stunt, he's got the soul of an artist.
A little experience, proper teaching...
...he could be the greatest grifter this old river's ever seen.
No, we ain't gonna cash in that $200 black chip...
...not till we have to.
Take your shoes off.
I fall asleep.
I heard somebody.
Percy!
I snaked it from the...
Your uncles, and...
- I was hiding it for you.
- In Father's coffin?
- How could you do such a terrible thing?
- I told you so!
I can't believe it.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry,
Miss Mary Jane.
I put it there when I heard you coming.
Why didn't you just give the gold to me?
Well, I hid it. Then I was gonna hide it...
I mean, not hide it where I hid it, but I mean...
It don't sound too good, does it?
On top of everything else, I find you stealing from my father's coffin.
- Why, Percy? Why?
- It's the brain fever.
Grave robbing is always the first sign.
I told you about him and his stretchers.
Generally, we have to put him in irons till after it passes over.
- Nobody believes me, because I'm a girl.
- Go to bed. It's late.
- But he's telling...
- Do as I say.
Oh, poor Percy.
My name ain't Percy.
What is it, then?
Abner.
Abner Williams.
My folks was all killed off by the...
The Paiute Indians.
Poor little Percy!
Miss Mary Jane, you've gotta believe me!
They ain't your uncles.
They ain't Harvey and William...
Your Uncle William's the only one who can handle him at these times.
- Let go!
- My leg...
Poor William, that the first sound out of him should be a cry of pain.
It is a miracle!
You've gotta believe me!
- Please, Uncle Harvey, let him speak.
- Very well.
All right, Percy.
If we ain't the reverends, then who are we?
He's the duke of Bilgewater, and you're the king of France.
- Oh, Uncle Harvey!
- Miss Mary Jane, you've gotta believe me.
I could hardly believe my eyes.
I thought I was seeing double.
Mary Jane, the emphis Steamer just docked.
Buttercup. Heaven Rose.
Who in tarnation's
Buttercup and Heaven Rose?
Those were the names Father called
Joanna and me when we were little.
They're our real uncles.
Uncle Harvey!
And, Percy, oh!
You did it, boy.
- You cheated us out of $3000.
- Don't. Please don't.
You know what's gonna happen to you now?
How could you do this to me?
I trusted you, and I never trusted nobody afore in my life.
I had plans for you.
We could have trimmed every mark from here to New Orleans...
...but you put a knife in my back.
- Let me kill him!
No, you don't!
You're in enough trouble as it is.
The people in this town know the truth.
This town's full of fools who'll stand for anything...
...excepting being shown up for the fools they are.
I'm gonna catch you.
Wherever you go, remember that. The world ain't big enough for you to hide from me.
There ain't a corner of this earth far enough away that I won't find you.
I'll pay you back for your treachery,
I swear it. I swear a oath, boy.
We'll meet again.
- Sheriff.
- All right...
Marshal, we's delighted to see you!
- Don't try nothing.
- No.
No, my friend.
Trust breeding, marshal.
Goodbye, all. Goodbye.
Au revoir, sweet ladies.
Percy, wait!
How can we ever thank you for telling the truth?
I apologize, Percy, for thinking you were as big a snake as the other two.
My name ain't Percy.
Whoever you are, you're fit to be kinfolk of mine.
And I'll fight anyone who says you ain't.
Come on in here.
Make yourself at home.
He'll stay with us.
He can have Papa's old room.
It's only right, if he's to be the man of the house.
- I'm only a boy.
- He can go to school right here in Pikesville.
When he grows up, he can take over the tannery.
I ain't worthy.
I can't wait to see him all dressed up in brand-new clothes...
...and fine, black leather shoes and sitting in the family pew in church.
You'll have to go to church, Abner.
Unless you want to burn forever in the eternal fires of hell.
Yes, Miss Watson.
Yes, Miss Joanna.
Black leather shoes and a job in the tannery.
Can you picture it, Jim?
It put me in a fair sweat,
I can tell you.
Coming right on top of His Majesty swearing to get me.
My, but he was a hard lot, near as mean as Pap.
We dang near got caught.
I reckon just ain't no accounting for the ways of royalty, Huck.
Maybe it'd be better to go back to Hannibal...
...and not take no chances on getting caught down here.
What you talking about?
Well, it'd be better for you to be a slave back where your family is...
...long as you gotta be a slave.
I ain't gotta be a slave, and I ain't gonna be a slave.
I'm gonna be free soon as we get to Cairo.
Know what I'm gonna do soon as we cross that border?
I'm gonna get me a job, a real job where I gets paid.
In a store, maybe.
Can't you see me, Huck?
"Yes, ma'am. These needles is the finest we got, ma'am.
They only 5 cents.
Well, thank you, ma'am."
Now, won't that be fine, Huck?
That store of yours don't sound no more fun than a pair of black leather shoes.
I'm gonna make a pile of money so I can buy my wife from that old farmer that owns her.
Then we's gonna work hard and save up and buy the two children.
Oh, Huck, honey, everything's gonna be all right.
It's all on account of you helping old Jim.
I ain't helping you because I wants to be no better than a low-down abolitionist.
It's because the only way
I can keep from going back to Pap...
...is to make sure you get free.
- I know that, Huck. I know that.
Consarn it.
One thing and another.
And I'll be lucky if I ever get to New Orleans.
Huck, it's getting too foggy to see where we's going.
Look, Jim!
A houseboat.
She done kill herself on the rocks.
She looks deserted.
Let's go aboard.
I don't want to go fooling around no wreck.
"Keokuk, lowa."
Keokuk, lowa.
They come from up north.
Who knows? Maybe rich folks owned her.
Who knows what they left behind?
- Treasure even, maybe.
- Maybe.
Come on! Let's go.
Pap!
Jim! Jim!
Jim! Look what I found.
I told you there'd be treasure.
- What's in there?
- Don't go in there!
- Why not?
- There's a dead man in there.
- For sure?
- Somebody shot him right between the eyes.
Jiminy!
- Let's get out of here.
- Are the eyes still open?
Staring right at you.
- Let me see him.
- Huck, please don't go in there.
- I ain't never seen a dead man before.
- You seen Peter Wilks in his coffin.
Yeah, but he weren't murdered.
Looking in the eyes of a dead man is the worst bad luck you can get.
Well, I don't believe in signs.
I'm gonna look.
You listen to me, Huck, you do what I said! You hear?
Don't you go in and look at that man.
Please, Jim, don't hurt me, please.
Oh, Huck. Oh, honey.
I'm sorry.
Old Jim wouldn't hurt you for nothing in the world.
Oh, my God. Forgive me for this.
Who's in there?
Come on out unless you want a load of buckshot in your forward cabin.
Why, ain't but a boy.
What could I do for you gentlemen?
We's slave catchers.
Looking for runaways.
Who you got aboard there?
Now, don't you try lying, boy.
We heard you talking.
- How many of them is in there?
- Just one other.
White or black?
White. I sure am glad you all come along.
You see, it's my cousin Jeb.
Him, he's sick.
I got that raft over there so I could bring him in to shore.
Maybe you gentlemen could help me get Jeb on the raft...
...so I could take him in to shore.
- We's in a hurry, boy.
- Now, Obie, we gotta help him.
Well, reckon we come aboard and have a look.
Come right in, gentlemen.
Come right in.
Straight ahead.
- Well, where's he at? In that room there?
- I guess so.
Cousin Jeb will be much obliged.
Everybody else we asked run off.
- That's infernal mean.
- Odd too.
Lookie here, boy.
What's the matter with your cousin Jeb?
Well, it's the...
- Nothing much.
- You're lying, boy!
- What you keeping such a secret in there?
- Let's have a look.
You won't have to touch Jeb, so there ain't much chance you'll catch it.
Don't you go in there!
That cousin of yours got the smallpox, and you know it.
Why didn't you just say so?
Well, when I told folks, they run off.
Let's get out of here.
Don't leave people to guess what's the matter.
Thank you. Thank you kindly.
Breaking up.
Let's get out of here.
Look! Get him!
I can't see him!
- There!
- Get the skiff!
- Well, we'll tend to him later.
- Lf he get away, we lose $500 bounty.
- Come on!
- The skiff's done floated off.
- Here, hold this.
- Get the hook.
Hurry it up.
Jim!
- Wait. Come on. Come on.
- Go! They's over that way.
They's over that way.
I heard them.
Engines full ahead.
From the sound of it, we just chewed up a raft, captain. No need to stop.
Reverse your engines. If that was a raft, there might have been men on it.
- Reverse engines!
- Yes, sir.
Mighty strange, a little boy alone on a raft with a negro. Eh, captain?
Jim here's my lawful manservant.
Williams is my name, captain.
Percy Williams.
And like I said,
Jim here's my lawful manservant.
My folks was all killed off by impostors posing as relatives.
We had to run off or get killed.
You see, don't you, captain?
You're giving me answers to questions I never asked.
I don't care where you've been.
All that concerns me is where this boat's going, and that's all the way to New Orleans.
You got passage money?
Passengers is the only ones that keep idle aboard my ship, so you've got to work.
There's a fireman needed in the hold, and my cabin boy's run away on another ship.
Me? A cabin boy?
You sent for me, sir?
Yeah, I got an errand for you.
Yes, sir?
You wanna take her, boy?
- Do I! Sir.
- Come along.
- Thank you, sir.
- Keep her firm but easy.
She's got a will of her own, but you let her know who's the boss.
Don't seem like there's nothing to it at all.
Who'd ever figure piloting the Mississippi was this easy?
Be careful, boy. It takes a long time to learn the river...
...and just when you do, she changes on you.
One thing about her never changes.
She can take you anywheres you wanna go in the whole world.
If you know and understand her, she'll do that, but there's another side to her.
She can kill you on a reef, or she can take you straight down to the bottom too.
- I don't see no sign of a reef.
- Of course you don't.
There's one out there on the portside.
That's a sandbar building up.
I've been expecting that from the kind of spring we had.
Moonlight's showing lines and circles in slack water.
That's a sign of troublesome places shoaling up.
Signs. That's the only help you get from the river.
Hot sun means there's going to be wind tomorrow.
A floating log means the river's rising.
A silver cloud across the moon shows there's a storm coming...
...and a storm can take you right up onto a snag.
Now, all them's signs, son...
...and you got to learn them if you're going to learn the river.
I always thought them...
Them signs was so...
- Beautiful?
- Yes, sir.
And now I find out they don't mean nothing but trouble.
But they're still beautiful, boy.
Don't you ever lose sight of that.
The beauty of the river is the first thing a man sees.
Then he learns the orneriness that lurks beneath.
And sometimes, that takes away the beauty, and that's a bad thing.
If it ever happens to you, boy, you get off the river.
Meantime, mind your chores. One of them is to look to the wants of the officers.
So you step down to the bar and fetch me a pint of spirits.
Yes, sir.
Now, then...
I'm breaking watch soon...
...and I'll want easing off after this night's work.
- Well, go ahead.
- Yes, sir.
Pint of spirits for the captain.
Bartender, how about a drink for my lady friend?
What seems to be the troub...?
Why, you little...
It's you!
I'm gonna kill you, boy.
You know how?
I'll throw you in that paddle wheel.
Even if they find the pieces the fish don't eat...
...they'll still think it's an accident!
- Now back to the paddle wheel!
- No, no, no, Bilgewater.
That ain't the Christian way.
I didn't mean Your Highnesses no harm.
We know that. I, by divine right, and Bilgewater here, by his infinite wisdom...
...that concern for them sweet Wilks gals was the only thing in your heart. We knew.
- We did?
- Why, of course.
So we'll just let the dead past bury the bygone.
- Will you shake on that, Percy?
- Abner.
Abner.
A $20 gold piece!
Nothing like coin of the realm to seal up the raveled sleeve of friendship.
Much obliged.
Excuse me, Your Majesty.
I gotta give the captain his pint.
Oh, Abner! Tell me...
...how is your African friend?
- Jim?
He drowned. Slipped off the raft in a deep sleep. Never knowed the difference.
I saw to it that he got proper funeral orgies.
That must have made you feel plenty sick.
Nope. He was talking in his sleep, saying how he was gonna run off to the free states.
No!
I was so mad. I was all ready to shove him off the raft.
I would've if he hadn't rolled over and just saved me the job.
Well, I guess it's just for the best somehow.
If he was aboard this steamer, he'd be in plenty hot water.
Tomorrow, we put in to the last town before Cairo.
There'll be slave catchers and law officers all over this old tub looking for runaways.
Well, good night, Abner.
Pleasant dreams.
Come, Bilgewater.
Leave it to me.
Slickers.
Gee, it sure fit me good, but Capt. Sellers...
...he'll need it for the next cabin boy.
Well, you stay here.
I'll go ashore by myself.
It ain't but a little ways to the free territory.
If you get caught, Jim,
I'll have to go back to Pap.
But this is your chance.
Capt. Sellers, he be going downriver to New Orleans.
- Don't you want me to go with you?
- Of course I do.
Well, then, come on!
- Be careful.
- All right. You too.
It's cold.
- You let them get away!
- Easy, easy, Bilgewater.
That $200 is as good as in our pockets right now.
You just leave everything to me.
Carmody's carnival!
See it now!
This is our last stop before heading north.
Ten cents! The tenth part of a dollar.
No expense has been spared...
...in making this the greatest show on the Mississippi.
See the lions perform!
Bearded lady!
Bareback riders!
You crossing over to Cairo, Illinois, mister?
Yep! Going north tonight.
Today's the last chance to see the show...
...that thrilled the crowned heads of Europe!
The greatest extravaganza ever seen in these parts.
Come on, Jim.
Boys, over this way.
All right, George, keep them moving.
Catched six of them trying to get across Goodman's Creek into free territory.
They'll be on their way south by the next boat.
You stay here, Jim.
We're gonna join the circus.
Be careful, now.
Oh, Orville, stand up.
You can't learn any new tricks laying down.
Orville!
Beg pardon, but where can I find
Mr. Carmody?
Here's his dinner.
- Orville don't like turnips.
- He'll eat the same as me.
But, Mr. Carmody, if he don't get red meat soon...
...l'll be afraid to go in the cage with him.
What happened to that zebra?
Well, he was pulling the lead wagon the night it rained.
And when we get to Chicago, we'll be living off the fat of the land.
Mr. Carmody.
Ten cents! The tenth part of a dollar.
We have spared no expense to give you the greatest show on the Mississippi.
- We got a snake handler.
- That's me.
A bareback rider that defies death by riding a dangerous African zebra.
And he can get ornery at times.
You don't have an emperor of Patagonia, I suppose?
Emperor of Patagonia?
No, we haven't got one of them...
...but we do have a juggler that's A-number-one...
...east or west of the Mississippi.
If I had some oranges,
I could show you.
And we've got an honest-to-goodness lion act.
Oh, well, being as how I'm the world's youngest lion tamer myself...
...that wouldn't interest me none.
You're the world's youngest lion tamer?
Well, that's how I was billed in my folks' circus.
When they had a circus, before they all died off of the smallpox.
The emperor of Patagonia and me, well, we had it before, so naturally we lived.
Well, I ain't never heard of Patagonia, let alone the emperor.
Well, that don't hardly seem possible.
Everybody out West had heard of him.
Folks would come from miles around just to see a genuine piece of royalty.
My folks snaked him out of Patagonia when they was there converting the heathen.
I thought you said they was circus folks.
Well...
They slid into that when they seen there was no money in heathens.
I see.
And they sure struck it rich with the emperor.
He was our biggest attraction.
I used to get a sore arm, toting them sacks of money to the strongbox.
You're the world's youngest lion tamer?
We already have a lion tamer.
Me.
I can't take another lion tamer's job.
Well, Orville might not be happy working with anybody but me.
And I might not be happy working with Orville.
He didn't mean that, Orville.
Lion taming's out, but as long as you ain't got another emperor of Patagonia...
Well, now, if we weren't leaving town tonight, I'd like to talk to him, but...
It wouldn't do you no good.
Unless you could talk Patagonian, like me.
Well, what if he was to say to you:
"Gorp gorp figgle-zoop plunk."
Well, you wouldn't have no notion what he was saying to you.
- What would he be asking for?
- For one of them turnips.
Well, you bring him around, and I'll talk to him.
But if I do put him on and he starts drawing crowds...
...he's gotta stay with us till we get to Chicago, and them's my terms.
Well, I'll do my best to convince him...
...but I ain't promising nothing.
He's got an uncommon level head for a Patagonian.
You didn't believe all that, did you, Mr. Carmody?
Not one single word of it.
But that young'un's got more circus blood in him than you and me put together.
Just hold still, and I'll make the prettiest old zebra out of you you ever did see.
There.
Keep going, Jim.
Just gurgle more.
Huck, honey, I'm grateful for you teaching me Patagonian and all that...
...but how come we just can't wait till it's dark and sneak across the border?
You'll get caught for sure, Jim.
This way, we get free board and lodging all the way to Chicago.
Them men had their tongues hanging out just to get us to go along with them.
Just think, Jim:
Carmody's International
Carnival and Circus.
Carmody and Finn's
International Carnival and Circus.
Finn and Carmody's
International Carnival and Circus.
Try it again, Jim.
Ladies and gentlemen, you have all seen the vicious bear...
...the screeching vultures, the African zebra...
...the roaring lion, bearded ladies, bareback riders...
...midgets, animal acts and the like.
And now...
...for the very first time in these parts...
...Carmody's International
Carnival and Circus presents...
...accompanied by his friend and interpreter...
...formerly the world's youngest lion tamer...
...His Highness, the emperor of all Patagonia!
The emperor greets you.
And now, if any of you good people have any questions...
...that you would like to ask the emperor about Patagonian politics...
...or international diplomacy...
...or harem life...
...just speak right up.
Now, are there any questions?
How much does an emperor get?
- A hundred dollars a month.
- A hundred dollars a month.
I'd have never believed it.
Now, are there any other questions?
Don't he know that keeping a harem is sinful?
The emperor says he didn't knowed it till he got to this country.
But when he gets his throne back, he's gonna kick out all the harem, excepting one.
Now, there's a fair deal and a big move to make.
- Now, are there any more questions?
- Yeah!
I got a question
I'd like to ask the emperor.
Send for the sheriff.
All right, speak right up.
Well, speak up, sir. Don't be afraid.
Ask the question.
I'd like to ask the emperor...
...what's the penalty in Patagonia for impersonating royalty?
What do we do?
Soon, cut out to the river real, real soon.
Man dangerous.
The emperor says that's a very interesting question...
...and he'd like an hour or two to think it over.
Now, if you good people will excuse him. Come on, Jim.
That ain't the right answer.
Although it's the one you might expect from an impostor.
Impostor? Now, just a minute...
I charge you with harboring a runaway slave!
A runaway slave?!
That couldn't be!
Why, the emperor here was brought to me...
...by one of the most respected circus folks in the country.
World's youngest lion tamer?
- That's right. You recognized him.
- No.
But I'd sure like to see him do his stuff.
Matter of fact,
I'd give $ 100 American currency...
...to see that young'un jump into the lion's cage.
A hundred dollars? Come on, son.
But, Mr. Carmody,
I'm only a boy.
That's those darn turnips.
They've made him mad.
Well?
Is he a lion tamer, or is he a fraud?
I got $ 100 that says he's a fraud.
I'll split it with you, 50-50.
Are they frauds or ain't they?
Let them prove it.
We're waiting.
Come on, put up or shut up.
Hold it straight and tight.
And don't be afraid.
Huck, honey, don't go in there.
- He's a slave, a runaway slave!
- Run, Jim, run!
- After him!
- That's him! That's the one!
That's him!
- There he is! There he is!
- Jim.
- Jim.
- Huck!
- Huck, honey.
- Jim.
You little...
You're smart, aren't you, boy?
Too bad you found out how smart you are. You overreached.
Well, I'm gonna learn you overreaching don't pay.
Help! Help!
Help!
Hey, Orville hasn't had red meat in weeks.
Get out of there!
Come on, get out.
Just relax, sweetheart.
Just calm down, baby.
Who's out there?
Blackie, Bullet, shut up.
You'll wake up the dead.
Jim.
Huck, honey.
- Jim.
- I'm sure glad to see you.
We gotta get.
I was so close to freedom, right across them trees.
Wasn't no more than a mile or two, and then there's Goodman's Creek.
Across that creek is the free territory.
Some slaves around here told me...
I mean, them other slaves.
You could squeeze through here, couldn't you, Jim?
It ain't no use, Huck.
I'm too big a sinner.
You're always chattering about sin.
You ain't never sinned.
Except for running away from the widow...
...and I ain't even sure that's a sin.
Well, I lied to the best friend I ever had and kept him feared, and that's a sin.
Your pap, Huck, he's dead.
You remember that houseboat and that dead man was on it?
Well, that was your pap.
Poor Pap.
He never once in his life had any good luck.
And all this time,
I been afearing Pap...
...and there weren't no reason to be afeard.
I can't blame the Lord for not helping me, the way I treated you, Huck.
You know who the Lord helps, Jim?
Them that helps theirself.
Yes?
I'm Miss Douglas.
You got my runaway slave, name of Jim.
Well, yes, ma'am. Come in.
Come in.
You're no more than a girl,
Miss Douglas.
A mighty pretty one,
I might add.
But still no more than a girl.
Jim belongs to my ma.
We were staying at the hotel in town, just visiting here.
You can imagine the fit it put us in when we seen you dragging our slave up the street.
My ma, she took to her bed straight off.
That poor woman. Sit down.
Thank you. Thank you kindly.
The quicker she gets that naughty Jim back to Hannibal, the better off she'll be.
Of course. I'll fetch him.
I almost forgot.
The reward.
The reward?
Well, $200 your ma offered for the capture of the slave.
I'll have to get the two gentlemen that brought him in afore I turn him over to you.
Ma's in... Ma's in an awful sweat to get him home...
...so she can scold him proper for running off.
It won't take but a bit to get the two of them.
If you mind waiting, you can come along.
I'll wait, thank you.
How do you do?
I thought I heard voices.
The sheriff went to fetch the gentlemen that catched our Jim.
What a pretty dress.
This old thing?
My niece Betsy's got one an awful lot like it.
- She's just about your size too.
- Imagine that.
Betsy's staying with us for a few days.
Here?
Got a new baby over at her house, and her ma's got her hands full.
Ain't no need to whisper. Betsy could sleep through an earthquake.
Have a chair.
Thank you kindly.
Well, now, what might your name be?
- Sarah.
- Pretty name.
My mother's name was Sarah.
I always thought if me and Harlan had us a girl, I'd name her that in memory.
A girl child must be nice to do for...
...to make frilly dresses for her and the like...
...to teach to cook and to sew.
My ma learned me all them things.
Lucky woman, your ma.
We wasn't blessed but the one time.
Harlan. Named for his pa, of course.
Oh, fiddly-daddle!
I dropped a stitch.
I don't see it nowhere.
It's all right.
I found it.
- What'd you say your name was?
- Mary.
I thought you said it was Sarah before?
Yes'm, I did. Sarah Mary.
Some calls me Sarah, and some calls me Mary.
- That's the way of it, is it?
- Yes'm.
- Do me a favor, would you?
- Yes'm.
Thread a needle for me.
It's in there. Just...
That's it. Open it up.
I could do it if I was alone, but Ma always told me...
...spitting in public weren't proper.
All right, boy, what's your real name?
Bill or Bob or Tom, or what is it?
Please don't poke fun at a poor girl like me, ma'am.
Why, you ain't no girl.
You don't catch like a girl.
You don't know nothing about threading a needle.
Imagine holding a thread still and bringing the needle up to it.
You don't wear shoes like a girl.
Fact is, you don't wear no shoes at all.
Trying to hornswoggle me!
What are you, a runaway apprentice?
They treated you bad, and you made up your mind to cut. Is that right?
- Well, what you doing here?
- They...
They said they'd pay me if I helped slaves get free.
Abolitionists!
Well, you're honest.
I'll say that.
You just tell the sheriff the truth like you told me, and it won't go hard with you.
Thank you, ma'am.
Could I please have a drink of water?
I'll get you some lemonade.
Thank you kindly.
I always kept a pitcher of lemonade for Harlan.
I've got the keys, Jim.
You'd do this for me, Huck, after I lied to you about your pap?
Well, I don't think it was right, Jim...
...but I never known nobody who didn't lie one time or another.
Besides, I'm beholden to you for saving my life.
Let's go.
I can't go, Huck. It's my leg.
These things hurt.
My leg's too big.
Jim.
Come on, let's go.
Help me.
Come on, let's go.
- It weren't a girl. It was a young boy.
- It's him.
Poor thing. He must have been scared and scooted out.
- Well, quick, afore he gets the slave.
- Where's he at?
- He's over in the shack.
- Listen here, Harlan.
Take it easy with that poor child.
Yes, love, I will.
- They're gone. Get the dogs.
- Gone?
- Probably headed to Goodman's Creek.
Come on, hurry them up.
Blackie, Bullet, come on.
You two just stay out of the way.
- Here, let me help you. Come on.
- How much further?
You have to try, Jim.
You have to try.
They got the scent, all right.
Those slaves lied, Huck.
Maybe we took the wrong way.
Come on, we're close.
I know it.
Look, Jim. Goodman's Creek.
I can't make it, Huck.
It's my leg.
You gotta get across.
Go on, Jim. Go on.
The vest. Give me the vest.
Thattaboy. Now get!
Get, straight thataway. Good luck, Jim.
Straight thataway, go on.
Over this way!
We got him! We got him, sheriff!
Sheriff, he done it. He done it.
He let that slave go free.
All right, boy, where is he?
- He drowned trying to cross the creek.
- He's lying!
I ain't blaming you for getting mad, mister.
The job you gave me was to get him free, and not to get him drowned.
- What?!
- So it wouldn't be right, keeping this.
- Twenty-dollar gold piece? Abolitionist!
- Why, you little...
No, you don't!
- I'll keep this for evidence.
- We ain't aboli...
You shut up.
I reckon I'm as bad as they are, sheriff...
...but what chance has a poor little boy like me got with grown-up slickers?
- I'm gonna kill you.
- Here.
The judge ain't gonna like the sound of that kind of talk.
I know this wasn't none of your doing, boy, but you best come along.
Bet you're as hungry as a bear.
I'd like to, sheriff, but I'm worried about my raft.
I left her up on the creek...
...and I'm all in a sweat somebody might have took her.
Nothing's safe with abolitionists around.
Sheriff, don't lis...
No more of that if you want this buckshot to stay in the barrel.
Soon as you find your raft, you hide her good.
Then come back to the farm.
The missis made huckleberry pie today.
It's my favorite.
Now get moving...
...both of you.
Now you hustle along, boy, or my missis will send me back for you.
Jim! Jim!
Jim!
Jim, where are you?
Here I am, Huck! Here!
Look what I found!
A new raft.
- Ain't she a pretty one?
- Sure is pretty, Huck.
Found a good one, didn't I?
- Where'd you ever find it?
- She sure is a nice one.
Bless your little heart.
- Am I glad to see you.
- Me too.
She ain't as good as ours by a thousand miles.
She needs a wigwam for keeping out the rain.
And a nice dirt floor so she'd be high and dry.
Turns out I wasn't lying to that sheriff.
You better keep out of sight.
- They'll be coming back to fetch me.
- It don't matter now, Huck. I'm free.
Me too, and I aim to stay that way.
That nice woman of his probably got her heart set on teaching me...
...how to thread a needle proper.
What you gonna do, Huck?
I reckon I should go back and show the widow and Miss Watson I'm alive.
That's good. You do that.
That's what I should do, but I can't float upstream to Hannibal...
...so I'll just have to keep going south for a while.
Might even go as far as New Orleans.
- Maybe I better go with you.
- Well, I'll be hornswoggled.
After all the pains I've been to.
Then why don't you come with me, Huck?
We'd get a fine job up north.
Maybe the same store.
We could work hard and save up.
Before you know it, we'd open up our own store. Oh, lordy, Huck...
...before you know it, we'd be rich, you and me both.
Now, wouldn't that be fine?
I wouldn't be no good in that store, Jim...
...unless I got all civilized...
...and I been there before.
A steamboat!
I'm going south, Jim.
Give me a push off.
If I get in the main stream,
I can catch her.
Boy, ain't she a beaut, Jim?
You take care, now, Huck.
Ain't no telling how much mischief you can get into between here and New Orleans.
That's for sure.
I hope you get rich, Jim.
Richer than Croesus himself.
You'll write to me, Huck?
I can't write too good, Jim.
It don't matter.
I can't read at all.
Bye, Jim.
Bye, Huck, honey.
God bless you.
[ENGLISH]
Gentlemen...
We are gathered here today as representatives... of some of the greatest design teams in the world.
We are here to listen to a proposal... from a Mr. X... a man who is 50 years ahead of his time...
A man who is undoubtedly... the world's greatest aircraft designer.
The daddy of them all.
Mr. X?
Are you with us?
Yes... l am with you,
Mr. President.
Gentlemen, you must forgive the extraordinary... security precautions taken today.
But when l tell you that Mr. X... is none other than the man who designed... the International
Rescue aircraft... you will understand the importance of security.
Mr. X has a proposition to put to us... for a revolutionary new type of aircraft. lt is, perhaps...
The most exciting moment in the history of our company.
And now, gentlemen, the moment has come.
What is it to be?
An aircraft that flies 10 times the speed of sound...
A space vehicle that travels the speed of light? lf l were able to guess...
Mr. X would not be here today.
And now, Mr. X, it is with great excitement... that we await breathlessly... the details of your new design.
Well, gentlemen... l thought it would be a good idea... in this day and age of, uh, speed...
And, uh, things like that... to build an...airship.
An airship?
An airship?
A beautiful island in the pacific... secret base of
International Rescue...
So far undetected.
Outwardly, the luxury home of millionaire ex-astronaut...
Jeff Tracy.
Now, let's have a rundown... on the International
Rescue craft.
At the moment, there are 5.
Thunderbird 1... sleek, first, and fast.
Thunderbird 2... giant transporter.
Carries all the rescue gear to the danger zone.
Thunderbird 3... designed for space rescue.
Thunderbird 4... capable of withstanding the pressure of the depths.
Thunderbird 5... space monitor.
Capable of receiving or intercepting... distress calls from any part of the world.
And l'm telling you, Brains, in no uncertain terms...
That we now need a Thunderbird 6.
Sure, Mr. Tracy.
But can you give me some sort of a steer? l like to work to a specification.
Specification?
You didn't need to work to a specification... when you designed that airship... for the New World
Aircraft Corporation.
That's right. l didn't.
And what happened?
They laughed.
Yeah, that's right.
They laughed.
And then they built it.
There you are, Brains.
Your specially commissioned painting of Skyship 1.
Thanks, Virgil. lt's really great.
But l guess that's about the nearest... l'm gonna get to it for some time. l'm sorry about this,
Brains.
But l've got this feeling, and l know l'm not wrong.
We desperately need a Thunderbird 6.
That's OH, Mr. Tracy.
Of course, l would have liked... to have been on the maiden voyage.
Sure.
But at least
International Rescue... will be represented by
Alan, Tin Tin, and Penelope.
They'll give you a full report.
So, you like the painting, eh?
Say, talking of painting...
Alan?
Yes, Dad?
You better get cleaned up.
Don't forget, it's your farewell dinner tonight.
Just 10 more minutes, Dad, and l'll be through.
How's she looking?
Great. Just great. l finished our packing, Mr. Tracy.
Our packing?
Tin Tin, come here a minute.
Certainly, Mr. Tracy. ls there anything wrong?
Tin Tin, Alan wanted to travel to England... in an unconventional way.
Well, l've organized that.
But it's gonna be a long journey... and not exactly the way for a young lady to travel... in this day and age.
You are traveling by scheduled airline.
But Mr. Tracy... l want to travel with Alan.
Now, Alan leaves tomorrow... and you leave in 2 weeks' time.
Understand?
Come on, Mother, over here.
You'll get a good view.
Well, l guess we've seen a lot of launchings... but this will beat all.
Say, where's Tin Tin? l don't know, Dad.
Strange.
Unusual for her not to see Alan off.
Here she comes.
So long, folks.
Dearest Brains... l know how much this project means to you... and l feel that you, not l, should be making this trip.
But, of course, you are the one person who cannot be spared. l shall be thinking of you.
Love, Tin Tin.
P.S... l stowed aboard the Tiger with Alan.
She's what?
That's right, Mr. Tracy.
She's aboard the Tiger with Alan.
He flies through the air
With the greatest of ease
The daring young man in his flying machine
His movements are graceful
All girls he can please
And my heart is stolen away lsn't it a lovely ou_it? lt belonged to my ancestor, the Duchess of Crighton Ward.
Well? What do you think,
Parker? l think it's very elegant, milady.
Mind you, l prefer mini-skirts m'self... but l suppose it's appropriate... that you should be dressed like that...
For the revival of the airship, so to speak.
Thank you, Parker.
And that ou_it suits you beautifully.
Well, if Alan's on schedule... he should be arriving at any moment.
Yes, milady. l understand that he's been on his way now for 2 weeks.
That's him, Parker.
We must go onto the roof and see him land.
Come on.
There it is, Tin Tin.
Yes, Alan!
It looks lovely!
OH. You know what to do. l expect he's coming in to land.
Milady, he's coming straight for us! l don't believe it.
Hi, Penny. Hi, Parker.
Alan, l'm so glad you're safe.
You gave us quite a scare.
Gee, l like your ou_it, Penelope.
Yes, l was rather pleased with it myself.
Uh, uh, excuse me.
All the family send their love to you.
Uh, excuse me,
Mr. Alan. Excuse me.
What is it, Parker?
Uh, your aircraft, sir.
It's got no pilot. l--l just thought l'd point it out to you, sir.
Oh, forget about it,
Parker. l'm finished with it now.
Now, you were saying,
Penelope...
Mr. Alan, please!
Don't you understand? lt's gonna crash into the house!
Parker! What has got into you?
Sorry about that, Alan.
Stone the crows... lt's going to land on its own.
Parker? Milady?
Tin Tin's an excellent pilot.
Don't you think, Parker?
You should have seen
Parker's face, Tin Tin. lt was the funniest thing l've ever seen in my life. l can just imagine it.
Of course, l saw immediately what Alan was up to because l knew you were on board.
Jeff called me yesterday. l could hardly keep a straight face.
Come in.
All the baggage is aboard, milady.
Thank you, Parker.
Now, there's only one thing
Ieft to do before we leave.
Bon voyage.
Bon voyage.
Bon voyage, milady.
As president of the New
World Aircraft Corporation... this flight is of paramount importance to me.
The fact that members of International Rescue... will be on the maiden flight... enables us to achieve worldwide publicity. ln order to make this possible in the first place... we have given assurances to them... that the strictest security arrangements... will be enforced.
That is why the airfield is cleared of all personnel.
The passengers are due to arrive in, um...
30 minutes.
Contact.
Virg, l can see them at 2 o'clock!
OH. l've got them, Scott.
Right.
Operation escort, go!
This is what l call driving in style, milady. lt isn't every Rolls-Royce that has an aircraft escort.
OH, all checks complete.
-Martin?
-Yes, sir.
-Lane?
-Yes, sir.
-Carter?
-Yes, sir.
-Hogarth?
-Yes, sir.
OH. Return to your posts... and await the arrival of the passengers.
Hold it right there.
Quickly, we haven't much time.
Scott from Penelope.
Come aboard with the others and have a farewell drink.
We'll meet you in the ballroom.
The ballroom!
May l book the first dance?
No, Scott.
It isn't what it seems.
You'll see.
And now, by the courtesy... of the New World
Aircraft Corporation... we bring you the
Drinking Half Hour!
Now, milady, what will it be? l think this occasion calls for champagne... all around, Parker.
All around, milady?
All around, Parker.
And now,
Iadies and gentlemen... on behalf of the New World
Aircraft Corporation... l welcome you aboard
Skyship 1.
As you know, this is the maiden flight. lt is, of course, a great honor... for us to have such distinguished guests.
You can be assured that the crew and myself... will do everything in our power... to make this a trip to remember.
Well, bon voyage.
Bon voyage!
Godspeed, milady.
OH, one minute to takeoff.
Now, we know the ship is fully automated.
Everything is preprogrammed-- height, speed, course.
We're all supposed to be trained men.
The only way that our cover will be broken... will be if anything goes wrong with the ship.
Takeoff now, 30 seconds.
Well, we're off.
Come in.
Dinner is served in the bottle room, milady.
Well, they've gone.
May we have the blinds drawn, Captain?
The entire operation of this Skyship...
Lady Penelope, is totally automatic.
As the light falls, the curtains will draw automatically.
Of course.
That's just the sort of thing...
Brains would have thought of.
Well, it looks as if we're all set for a lovely, peaceful holiday.
Calling Black Phantom.
This is White Ghost.
Calling Black Phantom, this is White Ghost.
Come in, Black Phantom.
Come in, Black Phantom.
Have disposed of cargo.
Operation Ambush underway.
Calling
International Rescue.
This is Lady Penelope.
Jeff, l want you to send
Thunderbird 1 and 2... to a disused airfield...
10 miles south of Casablanca. lnternational fix system
24-04. Reference E.
Ensure that Brains is aboard.
This is imperative.
Do not acknowledge this transmission.
Will call later with further details. lt's going to be difficult.
That's what we're paid for.
Now, l've had this whole place bugged. l want every word she speaks on this trip... to be recorded.
Whenever possible, l'll talk to her myself... and maneuver the conversation... in the right direction.
Right. Get to work.
OH, Carter, breakfast is served.
Start recording.
Morning, Alan.
Morning, Penny.
Morning, Alan.
Breakfast over New York.
What an experience.
This is really the way to travel.
Yeah, it's great.
Only thing is, as the ship's fully automated... if anything should go wrong with the computer... we could hit one of these skyscrapers... and then we'd really be in trouble.
Then, Alan... it would just be a simple case of... calling
International Rescue.
OH.
Calling International Rescue.
And now, gentlemen... it is with pride that l present to you Thunderbird 6.
Now, so that l'm able to demonstrate... this new machine properly... l have built this radio-controlled model.
The situation?
Man trapped in top floor of burning skyscraper.
Thunderbird 6 drives up to the building.
The helium balloon now rises... lifting a plastic hose into the air.
When the balloon reaches the correct height... the reel is locked off. l don't get it, Brains.
What's the point?
This is the point.
And so you see, gentlemen... another international rescue is made possible.
Well, Mr. Tracy, what do you think?
Well, it's, uh, certainly ingenious, Brains.
But it means building a vehicle... that gives us only one means of rescue.
The end product just doesn't justi_ the cost. l--l'm sorry. l'm afraid you'll have to scrap it... and start again.
Too bad about the wasted effort.
Wasted effort, Mr. Tracy?
Heh heh.
What's a mere 28 days...
Working day and night...
Think nothing of it.
We must be descending. l'm getting butterflies. l always do when we lose height.
You're absolutely right,
Lady Penelope.
We'll soon be flying over the Grand Canyon... at zero feet.
An automated announcement... will tell us when it's the right time.
Don't worry, you won't miss a thing.
There. You can see our exact position.
The Grand Canyon.
You know, l was once hopelessly lost... in a jet plane, and then, at last... l made contact with the Grand.
Was l glad to hear that voice!
You are directly over the Grand Canyon.
Your position
International fix system
24-24, Reference E.
Correction, Captain Foster. lnternational fix system
24-04. Reference E.
Of course. 24-04.
Heh. l didn't think l'd ever forget that.
Ladies and gentlemen... we are now approaching the Grand Canyon. lf you care to take up your positions on the balcony... you will be in good time... to get the most advantageous view point. l think it's the most beautiful sight l've ever seen.
Come across to the other side of the ship.
There's an even better view over there.
Yes, let's do that. l really don't think l like Captain Foster.
Ah, he's just an old man.
Thunderbirds 1 and 2... l trust the beaujolais was to your liking, Parker?
And now, how about a cigar?
As you know, milady... l've been spending quite a lot of time... with the stewards... drinking and all that sort of thing.
Well, what worries me-- they--they don't seem to know as much... about the ship as they ought to.
Thank you, Parker. l've had my own thoughts on the matter. l'm glad you told me.
Yes. Well, uh-- sorry if l disturbed you, milady.
You were quite right,
Parker.
Good night.
Good night, milady.
Yes, Penelope? l've just had some information from Parker. l'm a little uneasy.
Tell me, what do you think of Captain Foster? l don't go for him,
Penelope.
He's a little too smooth for my liking.
Tell me, Alan, has he been questioning you... about International Rescue?
As a matter of fact, he has.
Well, not directly, mind you... but the conversation always seems to lead that way. l think we'll have to go into the situation... a little more closely. l don't like the sound of it.
The storm seems to be getting worse. l think you'd better come in here.
We need to discuss this right away.
Oh, well, um...
Perhaps we are allowing our imaginations... to run away with us.
After all... everyone's interested in International Rescue. lt's only natural he should ask questions.
Oh. So you don't think there's anything... to worry about, Penelope?
No. After all, they have all been screened.
They're carefully selected men.
That was a close one.
Put on the edited tape.
Right.
One thing's for sure.
We gotta play this really cool from now on.
Lady Penelope, l underestimated you.
Calling International Rescue.
Jeff, l want you to send
Thunderbirds 1 and 2. lnternational fix system.
24-04. Reference E.
OH. Continue recording.
Doesn't sound as if we'll get much more tonight.
When l was talking to you just now, Alan... l discovered a bugging device in a lamp by my bed. l wondered why you'd changed your attitude... so abruptly.
What's our next move?
For the moment, nothing.
We know we're being bugged, but we don't know why.
We must just be on the alert.
OH. l'll mosey around... and see what l can find out.
Of course l understand,
Mr. Tracy. lt isn't quite the thing you had in mind.
Of course l don't mind designing yet another one.
You know, Scott, one of the remarkable things... about Brains is that he never loses his temper.
Well, if he did, l wouldn't blame him... after all the work he's done.
Upset? Me upset?
Of course l'm not upset!
Go ahead, John.
Father, l've just received a message... from Lady Penelope. lt was sent in scrambled electronic code.
Right, John. Let's have it. lt's just coming out of the descrambler now. lt reads, ''Ship bugged.
Reason unknown.
''Am investigating.
''lmperative, no communication from you.
''Will contact you when we have a lead.
''Signed, Penelope.''
F.A.B., John. Heep in touch. l don't like the sound of it, Dad.
We've gotta do something about this.
Yeah. But what?
Well, why not radio the police... at their next port of call?
Have the crew interrogated.
No. Whoever it is on that ship... that is looking for information... is probably an agent for a larger organization. lf we're to protect ourselves, we've gotta... wait for them to show their hand.
You lead an interesting but secretive life.
Your lifeline shows that you will meet many dangers.
You will become involved with a handsome stranger.
You would be well to let your heart guide you.
Well...stone the crows.
Beautiful, Alan.
But it's far too expensive.
Right. We'll take it.
You won't regret it, sir. lt will bring you much happiness.
Oh, Alan, it's been such a lovely day. l just wish it could never end.
The sari suits you very well, Penelope. lt was a very kind thought,
Captain. Thank you.
Did you get anything interesting today, Tin Tin?
Yes. Alan bought me this beautiful ring.
He paid far too much money for it... but l'm very thrilled with it.
Buying a ring for a young
Iady is prem significant... to me, Alan. Don't tell me you're going to desert... the league of bachelors. l'm afraid not,
Captain Foster.
The life l lead in
International Rescue... is far too dangerous to ask anyone... to share it with me.
For me, at the moment, marriage is out of the question.
That's right,
Captain Foster.
We all of us lead dedicated lives... in International Rescue.
And now, if you'll excuse me, l think l'll retire.
But wouldn't you like another drink?
Thank you, Captain, but no. lt's been a lovely, but very tiring day. l'm going to bed.
Oh, so soon? l'm afraid so.
Good night, everyone.
So, your rooms aren't bugged... but the lounge, bar, and dining room are.
All places where l go.
It would seem it's me... they want the information from.
But what? lf we knew that, we'd know the answer to everything.
Have you found any trace of the receiver?
Parker's had no luck.
None. The only place l haven't searched... is the gravity compensation room.
Well, the trip comes to an end in 14 days' time.
Whatever move they're going to make... must be made before we get back to England.
So we'll soon know. l think l can claim to have been to most places... in the world, but, oddly enough... l've never seen the pyramids. l've never seen them, either.
Well, we won't have long to wait.
We land in 15 minutes.
Oh, how dreadful.
What is it, Penelope?
There's been a terrible air crash.
A DX 102 airliner... tried to make a forced
Ianding on a disused... airfield 10 miles south of Casablanca. lts nose wheel collapsed... and the aircraft blew up, killing all aboard.
At last, we've got it. l've got to hand it to you, Carter... that newspaper idea of yours was just great.
Now, complete the editing. l want to hear that final message as soon as possible.
OH, girls, let's go.
Don't forget your camera, Penelope.
Don't worry. l've got it right here.
So, you see, Jeff, we nearly lost Parker.
Ah, now here's the coded bit.
We are enjoying our trip and looking forward... to our last port of call,
Switzerland.
Scott, take this along to Brain's lab... and get it decoded.
Yes, sir.
Oh, that's all right,
Mr. Tracy. l just love having my designs turned down.
Gee, Brains, your beautiful model.
Oh, h-hi, Scott.
Yeah. It just slipped out of my hand.
Dad wants you to decode this right away.
Gee, l wish there was something we could do to help them.
Don't worry. l've got a feeling... it won't be long now.
Mr. Tracy?
Yes, Brains?
Decoding of Penelope's
Ietter is as follows...
''lnterest is in me.
Reason unknown.
''Continue to stand by.''
Thanks, Brains.
Well, we now know that they're bugging only Penelope.
They're interested in what she says.
Now, what could
Penelope say... that would mean so much to someone with designs... on International Rescue?
Jeff, l want you to send...
Thunderbirds 1 and 2 to a disused airfield...
10 miles south of Casablanca. lnternational fix system.
24-04. Reference E.
Ensure that Brains is aboard.
This is imperative.
Do not acknowledge this transmission.
Will call later with further details.
Perfect. Just perfect.
OH. Now, what next?
Now, watch carefully.
Tomorrow, we make our
Iast stop--Switzerland. lt certainly is a fantastic car you have, Penelope.
The only one of its kind in the world, Captain Foster.
When those skis appeared out of the bottom... l just couldn't believe my eyes.
Oh, it has many other devices, Captain.
Many of them still top secret.
Switching to full boost, milady.
How are you doing, Tin Tin?
Fine. Just fine.
Switch in thrusters.
OH.
Right, have you decided what you're going to eat?
Mmm. l think l'll start with avocado.
Tin Tin?
Artichoke, please.
Likewise.
Ah. And for me the speciality of the house.
This is a cute place. lt's certainly imaginative.
Let's hope the service is as good.
Well, l guess this is for us.
Gee, what a novel idea. lt must have been fun traveling in trains... like this years ago.
Well, let's unload the cargo.
As Parker would say,
''lt looks a real good nosh.''
Talking of Parker... what's happened to him?
Surely he's not still outside?
But, of course.
The car is heated, you know.
11 :OO. We must go.
The skyship is programmed to take off at midnight.
As a matter of interest,
Captain... what would happen if you didn't get back on time?
Your dream holiday would just come to an end.
And now, Cinderella, we must go.
Are we clear, Parker?
Quite clear, milady.
You debugged the whole place, Parker?
No need, milady. It was already done for me.
There's not a hidden microphone anywhere, milady.
They've all been removed.
That can only mean one thing.
They've got the information they wanted. What now?
Parker, what have you to report?
Well, milady, they've been recording you on a tape machine... in the gravity compensation room. l managed to get a look in there.
They've been editing the tape--that was obvious.
And now they've got the tape machine... linked to a radio transmitter.
The jigsaw's nearly completed but not quite.
Parker, issue the guns.
They're in the false compartment... at the bottom of my blue suitcase.
From now on, it's emergency standby.
Black Phantom from White Ghost.
Message will be transmitted
1000 hours tomorrow morning.
Gentlemen, the Thunderbird machines... will be arriving here at approximately...
1100 hours tomorrow morning.
The final phase of Operation
Ambush has commenced.
OH. Rewind and stand by.
OH. Ready.
15 seconds.
Calling International Rescue.
This is Lady Penelope.
Jeff, l want you to send
Thunderbirds 1 and 2... to a disused airfield...
10 miles south of Casablanca. lnternational fix system.
24-04. Reference E.
Ensure that Brains is aboard.
This is imperative.
Do not acknowledge this transmission.
Will call later with further details.
The Thunderbird machines should be arriving... in approximately
10 minutes.
Stand by. lf pilots offer any resistance as they leave their machines... shoot them down. l've got it.
Penelope, l've got! lt's the only possible answer.
They've been recording your voice, right?
Right.
They've been editing the tape, right?
Right.
Editing is a form of rearranging.
They've been rearranging your words... to make you say something that they wanted you to say... and then they've transmitted it.
Now, who's the one person... who would act on your instructions?
Why, Jeff Tracy.
Roger, Scott.
Understand that you are at disused airfield.
Call me as soon as you've landed.
F.A.B.
Go ahead, Penny.
Jeff, this is an emergency.
Have you received a message from me?
Yes, Penelope. The boys are just about to land... at the rendezvous you requested.
Jeff, l haven't sent a message.
This is a trap.
Now, remember... just one sign of resistance from those pilots... and let them have it.
Thunderbird to base.
Thanks, Dad.
You gave us the warning just in time.
Setting course now to rendezvous with Skyship 1.
That's right, Scott.
The message was a recording of my voice.
Now, the quicker you arrive, the better for us.
You've got a fix on our position.
F.A.B.
OH, l've received a message from Black Phantom... to say the Thunderbird machines were landing.
By now, they must've taken over the ships... and shortly, they'll be on their way... to rendezvous with us.
Right, the playacting's over.
Round up our International
Rescue guests.
They're unsuspecting, so they won't be armed.
Not so unsuspecting,
Captain Foster.
Raise your hands, all of you. lt sounds as if Alan needs some help.
Tin Tin, l'll leave you my compact.
You can keep in touch with the boys.
F.A.B., Penny.
Come on, Parker.
Quickly, Parker.
Lane, get the other one as hostage. Quick.
OH, Foster, the numbers are eVen nOW... and we can outshoot you, you know that.
Throw your guns down and give yourselves up. l suggest you throw your guns down. lf you don't, you can say good-bye to Tin Tin.
Father, l've lost contact with Skyship 1.
Right, Scott.
At what position... do you expect to rendezvous with it?
According to my calculations, at approximately 10,OOO feet.
About 5 miles east of Dover.
Well, all you can do, Scott... is beat the hell out of those machines... and get there as soon as you can.
F.A.B.
Very smart, Penelope.
So you radioed your base?
That's right, Mr. Foster.
You should know that you can't outwit International Rescue. l'm not so sure.
The game isn't over yet.
We have you all as our hostages.
When the Thunderbird machines arrive... l've got an idea they're going to do... just what we tell them to.
Meanwhile, the gravity compensating machine... has come to a standstill.
The jet engines on this bus... are to give it forward movement only.
The ship can't maintain height... unless the gravity compensators are working. l'm well aware of the situation.
We're losing height quite slowly. lt'll be half an hour yet before there's any real danger. lt'll be half an hour yet before there's any real danger.
Martin, go up on the top deck... and radio down as soon as those
Thunderbirds arrive. Right.
Father, l'm at rendezvous point.
No sign of Skyship 1. l don't understand it, Scott. lt's a big ship.
It'd be hard to miss.
Oh, wait. l can see it. lt's about 8,OOO feet below me. l don't get it.
According to the New World pre-programmed schedule... it should be at 10,OOO feet at this point. l'm going down to take a look.
F.A.B.
Foster, Thunderbird 1 directly above us.
OH, Martin.
Right. Untie them. l want you all up on the top deck... and no false moves.
OH, father, l'm alongside. l can see one of the stewards standing... on the top deck.
Otherwise, no sign of life.
When Thunderbird 2 arrives, we'll attempt to board her.
Be with you in about
5 minutes, Scott.
OH, Virgil.
Dad, there's trouble ahead.
Dad, Skyship 1 is losing height.
Why? l don't know.
About one mile ahead is an early warning system... with interceptor towers.
The estimated height:
1,200 feet.
Below it is a missile site.
The way it looks from here...
Skyship 1 is on a collision course.
The only thing that can save it is its height.
But l've got my doubts. lt's a tower head.
We're going to hit it!
How far away is it? l don't know.
About a quarter of a mile. l'm coming up.
Dad, there's going to be a collision.
You'd better alert... all emergency services down on the ground. lt's a missile base about 5 miles east of Dover.
F.A.B.
What's the situation, Scott?
Well, the ship's swaying on top of one of the towers. lf that tower gives way... or the ship loses its balance... it's going to drop like a stone... it's going to drop like a stone... right onto that missile site below.
Come on, quickly.
Up on the top deck and move!
We've crashed, Foster.
Don't you understand?
Throw your gun away.
We're all in this together now. l said move!
Scott, l've been listening to your transmission. l've sighted Skyship. l'm coming in straight over the top.
Will lower escape unit.
Brains is already in there.
F.A.B. ls Brains armed?
He ought to be.
We've no idea what's going on. lt's OH, Dad. l've taken care of that.
Good boy.
Attention! Attention!
All personnel in section ''D''... to vacate site immediately.
Proceed with all movable equipment... to rendezvous ''G.''
This is an emergency.
Repeat: This is an emergency.
Virgil, pull off!
Pull off!
Your thrusters are throwing it off balance.
F.A.B.
Base and Thunderbird 2... we need to decide a course of action but fast.
As far as l can see... any attempt to get near that ship... is going to bring a disaster.
The turbulence from our motors alone... will be enough to tip it off balance.
Have you any ideas, Dad?
All personnel and vehicles to proceed to rendezvous ''G'' immediately.
This is an emergency.
Repeat: This is an emergency.
We need a solution,
Gordon, and quick.
As far as l can tell... the only way we're going to get them off that tower... in one piece is to get a vehicle on that top deck.
Nothing we've got would be any good, Dad.
Our machines are too heavy. l know. l know.
We need something light,
Iow air speed... high maneuverability, short landing distance.
Say, l've got the answer, Dad! lt's crazy, but it could work.
Hey, what's going on?
Thunderbird 2 is leaving.
Don't tell me they've given up.
That's right, Mr. Tracy.
We've got it aboard
Thunderbird 2... and they just left.
We did all the necessary checks and fueled it. l certainly hope it works. lt's just got to work.
It's just got to.
The top of the tower is crumbling. l'm going to attach a line... to the front of the ship to see if l can hold it steady.
F.A.B.
What the heck are they doing?
Why don't they come in and get us off this thing?
You saw what happened when they came in close.
Well, what are they going to do? lf you let me call them, l can find out.
Oh, no, you don't! l'm not falling into that little trap.
OH, Dad. Line secured. l think it's going to help.
Thunderbird 1, from Thunderbird 2.
One mile from you. l'm landed on a grassy stretch down below.
Well done, Virg.
That was a quick trip.
Yeah, well, you see... l've got a Tiger in my tank.
OH, Brains, over to you.
Scott and Virgil... l'm going to circle the ship... and then attempt a landing.
OH, Brains. lf you make it, the order of evacuation... will be first, Tin Tin, second, Penelope... then the crew, and finally,
Parker and Alan.
F.A.B.
Right, Scott, l'm in position.
Brains is on his way up. l'm going to fix a line to this end.
OH, Virg.
Still no radio contact with Skyship 1. l just don't understand it.
Something must be wrong.
We'll soon find out.
Attaching line.
Don't tell me they're going to try a rescue with that thing.
They must've got it from a museum.
You're dead right,
Mr. Foster.
But l'll tell you something.
It's a brilliant idea. l think it's the only chance we've got.
Lane, Get over on the other side of the deck.
Get ready to welcome our guest.
Right.
Brains!
Scott, that was a close one.
Are you OH, Brains?
OH. Climbing for second attempt.
Brains, you're not going to make it.
As soon as you touch down, l'll open up with my jets.
The slipstream should slow you down.
Right. Let's try it.
F.A.B.
Penelope and Alan, in a few moments... l'm going to open up my jet engines.
Hold tight to that rail.
Alan, raise your hand if you've understood me.
OH, folks, hold tight!
Well done, Brains.
OH. Tin Tin, you're first.
Jump aboard.
Oh, no, you don't.
Get out of that cockpit and move!
Scott, one of the stewards has got Brains at gunpoint.
Now we know why there's been no radio communication.
What're they going to do, Virg?
Looks as if Penelope is boarding the aircraft.
And the Captain's getting into the rear cockpit.
OH. Turn this crate around.
What's happened to Brains?
Everyone's moving towards the Tiger.
There's no doubt about it.
The crew is in control of the situation.
Things look bad, Dad.
Guys, hold it a minute.
Come on! Hurry it up!
Get back fast! This thing's going to collapse any moment!
What makes you think l'm coming back?
Double-crosser!
We've got to stop him!
Quick! Jump aboard!
Come on!
We're going to crash!
We're just overloaded.
That's all.
Watch out for trees!
Penelope, throttle back.
Thunderbird to base.
Father, we're not going to be able to hold her much longer.
How's the evacuation... of the rocket site progressing?
Nearly complete... but they want about another 5 minutes.
Do everything you can, Scott... to prevent that ship falling.
Penelope, throttle back.
We're down!
Where's the throttle?
Down on the left hand side.
Throttle back.
Penny, throttle back.
Penny, that's the wrong way.
Alan, it's jammed. l can't move it.
Alan, l can't free it.
What shall l do?
Get her nose up! Quickly!
Don't panic.
Alan, there's another bridge ahead.
Pull...up!
Pull the stick back.
Pull it back! Penelope...
Hold the rudder steady,
Penelope.
Alan, obstruction ahead.
Alan!
Alan!
This is it!
All personnel and vehicles... should by now be clear of sectors ''A'' to ''Q.''
Danger imminent. l repeat: Danger imminent.
Thunderbird 1?
Loud and clear.
Scott, l just received the OH from the missile base.
Evacuation has been completed.
You can let her go.
Right.
Did you hear that, Virgil? l heard.
OH. Release cables on 5 second countdown.
F.A.B.
Zero! l want to get into the rear cockpit, Penelope.
But first, we've got to get rid of Foster.
Hold tight, Tin Tin.
Hold tight, Tin Tin.
OH, Alan.
Hold tight, Brains.
OH, Penny, push the stick over to the left.
OH. Heep us steady, Penny. l'm getting into the rear cockpit now.
Alan, l've only just realized
Parker isn't with us.
We must've left him aboard the airship. lt's too late now, Penny.
Anyway, a few moments from now... we may be sharing the same fate.
That's our engine gone, Penny.
Hold tight.
Hold tight, Tin Tin. l'm putting her down.
OH, Alan.
Hold tight, Brains.
Emergency landing.
Good luck, Alan.
Hey, Tin Tin! l still say, Alan, that was a fantastic landing.
Well, if it hadn't been for Parker... we could've said we'd got away with it.
Are you sure there was no chance of him surviving... when Skyship 1 crashed?
Not a chance, Alan. l suppose it must be shock... but a few moments ago, l'm sure l heard... a distant voice calling, ''Milady.''
That's funny. l thought l heard it, too.
Milady!
Milady!
And now, it gives me great pleasure... to introduce to you all... my new vehicle--
Thunderbird 6.
Thunderbird 6? l don't get it.
Oh. l know what you're going to say, Mr. Tracy.
That you haven't approved the plans... how could it have been built anyway... et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
But, nevertheless, l present to you...
Thunderbird 6.
Built, tested, and approved.
This is
Thunderbird control.
Launch Thunderbird 6.
Brains! Ha ha.
Well, l'll be a...
Look at that.
Brains, you old son of a gun. l'll buy it. l agree it's a good design.
It has been built... and it sure has been tested.
# Summer magic
# That wonderful magic
- Who's it from?
- Oh, nobody you'd know.
Gilly, pry yourself away from that piano. There's work to do.
I don't see why Mother had to sell it.
Because it's the most valuable thing we own and we need the money.
How am I going to be a composer with only a guitar to compose on?
Hey! My fish!
I got to thinking about him the other day. Where was he?
Oh, Gilly, you can't take everything.
There's not gonna be room in our horrid new house.
And we can't afford to pay storage on junk.
Look at his poor eye.
Why is my stuff always junk and your stuff always priceless?
- Here, you can have him, Peter.
- Thanks! I'll put him with my junk.
Well, that did a lot of good.
Their poor mother.
One minute a happy wife, and then the fates strike a cruel blow and she's changed to a poor widow woman.
- Watch the teacup, miss.
- Yes, ma'am.
This family is going to be lost without you, Mary.
You too, Ellen.
In a book I was reading,
True Blue was the name of it, True Blue, they had this family, Lord and Lady
Darcy, and their beloved children.
- They lived in a magnificent castle.
- Aye, I do love them castle stories!
- The tray, Miss.
- Yes, ma'am.
Well, everybody worshipped everybody, so of course it was all terribly happy.
Then one day they lost all their riches.
Lord save us.
And they were driven from the castle and they were forced to live in a hovel.
It was not in a nice neighborhood.
But they had this loyal old family servant, and the faithful creature followed them from castle to hovel.
And she not only brought her own life savings, wrapped in a pitiful handkerchief, to her beloved mistress, but she remained with them to serve them for years without wages.
'Tis a beautiful tale.
And a lesson to the greedy.
It is that. And you, Miss Nancy, being all so interested in the welfare of the deserving, will be happy to know that Ellen and myself have found a nice situation in Salem.
At five dollars more a month.
Oh. I'm happy for you both.
Really.
- Finish the story, Nancy.
- I reached the end.
- End is right.
- Miss Nancy!
'Tis the men come for the piano.
Oh, Gilly.
Is this the instrument?
Pad.
Son. Pad.
Strap.
Mallet.
Dolly.
- Careful!
- It's just saying goodbye, Gilly.
Oh, 'tis a black day for the Careys.
- Back to your packing, miss.
- Yes, ma'am.
We've lost a friend, Gilly.
Sold for a mess of pottage.
Nancy, can't you ever keep quiet?
- Do you always have to make...
- Nancy! Gilly! Come quick!
- They got a thing! Come quick!
- A what?
A thing! Here she comes! Here she comes!
Oh, my! Look at that! Ooh!
- It's a player piano!
- Oh, I've heard one of them.
You don't need no hands.
Son.
Put it right there.
Suppose there's some horrible mistake.
Are you sure it's for us?
A Mrs. Carey sold the instrument we just removed for $150 cash and a swap.
This instrument is the swap.
Rolls in here.
Here's one we always put on when folks are moving.
Son.
- Let me play! Let me play!
- When you learn how.
Slow it down!
Here come the words now.
 # It's time for flittering
# Dusting off the trunk
and flittering far
# Where the grass is greener
# Now and then comes the time again
for flittering
# We'll soon be packing up
# Stacking up our dreams and bric-a-brac
for some new destination
# Don't know where but we're going there
# We're flittering again
# New places, new faces
# New friendships will start
# While old places, old faces
# Stay dear to our heart
# As we go flittering,
following a rainbow
# Flittering bright over the horizon
# Maybe then and maybe there
# We'll settle down and never care
# For flittering, flittering,
flittering, again #
- Mother!
- Hello, sweetheart.
- Feel better now?
- You bet. Sure glad you made the swap.
- Oh, it's wonderful, Mother!
- Let me tell her! Let me tell her!
Tell me.
Well, this one you don't need any hands!
You play with feet!
There's little rolls in with holes that make the keys go up and down.
- No!
- And guess what.
- What?
- I played. I played with this leg.
Nobody showed me how.
That's your smartest leg.
- You have almost everything done.
- Mm-hm.
Children, come over here.
- I've just come from the lawyers.
- Oh, what happened, Mother?
Oh, it's nothing that can't be solved.
We'll make out somehow.
It's just that I've learned we haven't quite as much money as I thought we had.
Go on, Mother.
The real blow was those mining stocks we'd counted on, the ones George Ferguson got your father to buy.
They're worthless. Not worth the paper they're written on, Mr. Manson told me.
Oh, well, that isn't so bad.
We're just in reduced circumstances.
I'll be very happy to beg.
I saw a beggar once and he had a tin cup full of money.
Things won't be so very different.
I'm afraid they will in a way.
You see, counting everything, we have exactly $50 a month to live on, so we can't even afford to move to the little house we were going to.
We can't afford that horrible little house?
Oh, Mother, that's wonderful!
Oh, Gilly!
What ails her?
- Mother, this came today. This.
- What is it?
Mother, you remember after father...
That evening when we all tried to make ourselves feel better by talking about things that had been fun, and the best thing we thought of was that time in Maine.
- And we saw the yellow house in Beulah.
- Yes!
And we peered in through the windows, and wasn't it beautiful?
- And nobody lived there.
- Hey, that was years ago.
- You're wild.
- I remember it.
- You weren't even born.
- Oh, stop interrupting.
- Your entire lives are about to change.
- Go on, Nancy.
Well, Mother, a couple of weeks ago,
I decided that I'd try to find out about that house.
So I wrote to the postmaster in Beulah, and he answered.
His name is Ossian Popham.
Isn't it a beautiful name?
Anyway, he's the agent for Mr. Hamilton, who owns the house, who's miles away in China or somewhere.
Probably an old missionary or remittance man in disgrace or...
- Could I see Mr. Popham's letter?
- It's all right, Mother. I...
- Nancy...
- Well...
"The pitiful plight of your good self and your little ones..."
Oh, Mother, read the last page.
"Beulah is brimming over with fresh milk for your baby boy..."
Who's a baby?
"...so there's no need for him to be blue with rickets." Nancy!
The important part's on the last page. Look.
It says the yellow house is vacant and Mr. Hamilton would be glad to rent it to a deserving family like ours for a mere $60 a year.
And he has the right to decide,
'cause he's not only the postmaster, but Mr. Hamilton's trusted friend, his factotum, power attorney.
- Slow down, Nancy.
- Oh, think of living in the country.
No storage bills. All our things will fit into the yellow house.
We'll be self-supporting.
Chickens. Fresh eggs.
Vegetables from the garden. Air. Space.
Honest toil!
- Can we, Mother? Can we?
- Oh, please, Mother.
But, Mother, my school's here and my friends.
- Beulah's a hick town.
- Abraham Lincoln came from a hick town.
Mother?
Your father loved you so, and he wanted so much for you.
It was his dream to live in the country.
So maybe he'd like to know we were together in the yellow house in Beulah.
Oh, Mother, I knew it, I knew it!
I wished it!
Gilly, get to the piano.
Mother, sit down there.
There. In anticipation of this glorious decisi髇, I've written a glorification.
But first, an introduction straight from the Bible.
Church chords, please, Gilly.
Thou shalt no more be termed forsaken, neither shall thy land any more be termed desolate, but it shall be called Beulah, for the Lord delighteth in thee. Amen.
Right. Now, Railroad Rag.
- What?
- You were just playing it.
# Land of promise, bounteous
# This is beautiful,
this is beautiful Beulah
- # In the rocky state of Maine
- # Land of plenty
# Meant for us
# This is beautiful,
this is beautiful Beulah
# Within our reach is there
# Grapes big as peaches there
# The cows and bees are busy
# Who needs any money
in the land of milk and honey?
# Sweet apple trees abound,
wild cherries all around
# Berries on the vine,
rambler roses twine
# They're so nice, it's a paradise
# Beulah land, so beautiful
# Let's set forth for it,
let's go north on that train
# Chug-a-choo, chug-a-choo
# To beautiful Beulah land,
beautiful Beulah, Maine
# To beautiful Beulah land,
beautiful Beulah, Maine #
Choo-chug-a-choo, chug-a-choo, whoo-whoo!
So this is Beulah.
Yeah, you're right in the heart of the city now.
The town, the whole thing, is wonderful.
How can we thank your father for all he's done for us?
The name Ossian Popham should flame across the sky with letters of fire.
Pa's just glad somebody's gonna be living in the old yellow house.
The Hamilton's haven't used it since uh... I can recollect.
What's the matter with it? Haunted?
No. Pa says it's just too fancy for these parts.
The way the Hamiltons fixed up the barn for dancing,
Pa says it'd darn near overpower a cow.
Your father didn't write much about his family.
Are you an only child, Digby?
Well, you might say so, ma'am.
I just have a sister.
Mother, look. The church.
How lovely and quaint.
Heavenly.
Yeah, and uh... believe it or not, we have a minister named uh... Mr. Lord.
- Is he any relation to...
- No, Peter.
Well, hold tight.
Country! Real country!
- We're out in the sticks, all right.
- Gilly.
Sticks?! It's the loveliest!
Land of promise. Land of opportunity.
Opportunity for what?
Well, you've got something there.
You're the first family to move into Beulah in more than five years.
Most people move away to the city.
That's where I'm aiming to get just as soon as I can.
See some of them bright lights.
Make a little money.
Money? The heavenly thing about the country is you don't need money.
You have the soil! The soil!
- What's soil?
- Mud.
We're here! We're home!
Oh, Gilly, come on!
The piano's here!
Mother! A quaint old pump!
You folks the Careys?
I heard you way up in the attic.
Yes.
You mean to tell me that you're the Careys?
- You must be Ossian Popham.
- Yes.
- At your service, ma'am.
- First dibs for bedrooms, Gilly!
Nancy!
Is this your treasured daughter, ma'am?
Well, let's just say my daughter.
Nancy, this is Mr. Popham.
Oh, my goodness. Um...
- Mr. Popham...
- No, you don't. No, you don't.
That must have been the invalid boy.
Mr. Popham, about that first letter.
I wrote it.
No need to go on. What you've done has come to me like a blinding flash.
Pa.
Pa, there's a boy up here.
It's the Carey boy.
Come on down, Lallie Joy.
That's my daughter, Lallie Joy.
She's awful shy.
She'd be more like me only her ma won't let her.
Look at me, Mother! Look at me!
- Wee!
- Peter? Where are you?
Look at me!
Wee! Wee! Look at me!
That must be the rickety baby.
Mr. Popham, I think it's time
I told you everything.
Oh, may I tell him, Mother, please?
You see, Mr. Popham,
I wrote that letter and we all...
Oh, I don't know how to begin.
Gee, I'm sorry.
They're too heavy for a girl.
Allow me.
You don't have to be nice or nothing.
She's my sister.
And that's the way it was.
Well, Nancy, the way I figure it, this worid's the only worid we've got.
That is, until we move on to the next one.
And there ain't nothing like a story that's a mite off'n the truth for making things interesting.
Like a painter improving on nature.
Yes. It ain't nothing like an out-and-out lie.
Of course not! Just a small white one, only colored a little.
You see, Mother,
Mr. Popham understands.
Now the first thing we must do is fix up this house.
Now, where to begin?
Well, standing before you is the best painter, carpenter, bricklayer in Maine.
You're wonderful!
Mr. Popham, one part of Nancy's letter was true.
- We don't have much money.
- Oh, money.
Forget about the money. When it's all done, we can figure that out.
I work cheap when I can take my time and get into some conversing.
Well, I ain't one to hurry.
We got one hurrier in the family and that's enough.
Mrs. Popham does everything right on the dot.
Sometimes I get terrible sick of seeing that dot.
Which reminds me, it's getting along toward noon time.
I'd better be digging for home.
Mariah sits and looks at the clock from 11:00 on.
Then she'll get a meal of cold pork and greens, cold string beans, ginger bread and custard pie on the table.
Then she'll holler, "Hurry up, Ossian!"
"It struck 12:00 more than two minutes ago and everything's getting overdone!"
- Well, so long, folks.
- Goodbye! Thank you.
Thanks for letting me crank her up, Digby.
Pa, I've been doing some thinking.
Good. Thinking never hurt anybody.
Pa, do you realize the farthest I've ever been from Beulah is Four Corners and I was too young to even remember?
What are you getting at, Son?
Pa, do you realize I ain't never seen nothing or done nothing?
- Go on.
- You yourself said, Pa, a man never gets anywhere standing in one place.
How much am I paying you, Digby?
Three dollars a week. But a fella can make that in one day in the city.
You gonna put a stop to it, Pa?
Nope. Might as well get it out of your system.
Might be coming about the right time, too.
The boy, Gilbert. He ought to be able to take on the job of driving this truck.
That Gilly boy. He's awful nice, Pa.
I got a feeling the money might come in handy for the Careys, too.
They're wonderful folks.
Even if they ain't got the rickets.
Oh, smell it, Mother.
Listen.
I feel sorry for city people tonight.
# Summer magic
# The soft summer magic
# Drifts across
# The meadows
# Summer magic
# It weaves through the willows
# Right into
# Your heart
# The song
# The river sings
# The joy
# The sunset brings
# Warm rain on blossoming
# Growing things
# Hearts grow dearer
# And heaven seems nearer
# Winter dreams
# Come true
# Oh, what magic
# What wonderful magic
# Summertime
# Can do #
Whoa! Whoa!
- Slow it down!
- Look out with that fool contraption!
- Slow it down!
- I can't!
Watch out!
Oh, gosh, I'm sorry, Digby.
Forget it. She was about to blow anyway.
Lallie Joy, another tire to fix.
- It was my fault. Let me fix it.
- Oh, no.
Digby always lets me fix the flat tires.
But if I'm gonna take over your job
I'd better learn how in case one blows when she's not around.
Might.
Uh... you can watch.
Mrs. Popham,
I've just been longing to meet you.
I suppose your husband's been too modest to tell you we all think he's a saint.
Nope. Never dared mention it.
I'm afraid he hides his light under a bushel.
He hides more than his light under that bushel.
- There's a whole mess of things...
- What a glorious, quaint little store.
You must just adore working in it.
There's all those things for the house.
Wallpaper, brushes. Paint.
Maybe we shouldn't splash things all over without Mr. Hamilton's approval.
No need to get permissi髇 for such puny things.
I told you, he's got deep-seated faith in my judgment.
Nancy, you'd better give Mrs. Popham your mother's grocery list.
Take her mind off'n what it's on.
Just a saint.
Now, we know we need wallpaper and brushes.
And you know those little tools that you use to scrape off...
I'm the king!
I'm the king! I'm the king!
Can I play?
- We don't play with giris.
- I'm not a girl.
- You got sissy hair.
- It's not sissy in Boston.
Sissy hair! Sissy hair! Sissy hair!
- You wanna fight?
- We don't fight with giris. Beat it!
Ooh! She's mad!
She'll pull your hair!
Hey, let's go swimming!
Last one in's a sissy from Boston!
Fraidy cats!
Come back and fight! Cowards!
Hank. Haircuts for the lot.
Be back to pick 'em up later.
Get down, boys.
Now you're taking over, here you are, Barney Oldfield.
- Say, thanks.
- Osh, I forgot to buy a stepladder.
Now you're talking like city folk.
Country folks don't buy stepladders.
- They borrow them.
- Oh.
- We forgot Peter!
- I'll see that he gets home all right.
Mr. Popham. Now that you've a spare minute thrust upon you, I'd like a word.
Mariah, why don't you get back to them strawberry preserves you're fixing?
Mr. Popham.
Just answer me yes or no.
Have you written to Mr. Hamilton advising him that you took it on yourself to rent the yellow house?
I told you I have written to him.
Has he written you?
Mm, no. He's a busy man.
No news is good news.
Besides, he's off in them foreign parts.
Heathens might have ate him.
And you're letting them Careys tear his house apart.
Redoing, planting.
Young 'uns running all over the place.
Selling 'em wallpaper for less than it cost you.
That lot never did move.
They got you bewitched and I know why.
You wore out in the people in this town with your stories and now you got new ears to listen to you.
But you'll be bewitcheder when Mr. Hamilton lands back in Beulah some fine day and wants his house back.
I'm warning you, Mr. Popham.
If you don't get a letter from him soon,
I'm gonna take matters into my own hands.
Mariah, your pot's boiling over.
Oh!
What do you mean, I owe you $1.25?
All I know is, I cut five heads.
All I know is, I got four kids.
One, two, three, four.
Maybe so, but I cut five heads.
You trying to tell me one of my son's got two heads?
I seen and cut five.
Maybe you better get yourself a pair of spectacles.
I sent four in, and I'm picking up four.
- All right. Forget it.
- Into the wagon, boys.
- How many heads did he cut, Peter?
- Five.
How am I going to get a job in this town if people think I'm a girl?
Oh, so you're going to look for work.
I'm the only boy in the family that's not working.
That puts a different complexion on things.
You see, you got on a handsome city outfit.
It's too good to work in.
A man hiring you might get the idea that maybe you wouldn't buckle down.
- Oh, I'll buckle down.
- Why, of course you will.
So... maybe we ought to arrange for a little swap.
I've been looking for a Buster Brown suit just about that size.
So if you'd consider swapping it for a pair of overalls to work in...
- With patches on it?
- Of course with patches. And a shirt.
That's a very, very fine piece of goods.
So, I won't take advantage of you.
Now, suppose that I... that I give you... two bits to boot.
- A quarter?
- That's a lot of money.
Hank Champlin has to cut a whole head of hair before he makes that much.
And he's got six mouths to feed at his house, too.
Osh, with the two bits to boot,
I can pay him for my fifth head.
Be right back.
Just one ladder in the house. We'll find something for you to stand on.
Oh, that's all right, Mrs Carey.
Oh, Mother, if we make the house so beautiful, suppose Mr. Hamilton will want it for himself?
Well, the way it looks now,
I don't think he would.
He could suddenly descend upon us.
He could swoop down like the Yellow Peril.
- Now, do be careful.
- Oh, it's all right.
Ooh... just get it up here.
Don't you think you ought to have someone to help you?
Mother, any idiot can hang wallpaper.
Oh!
Mother! Mother, come here!
I want to show you something!
Oh!
- Get him out!
- He won't bite! His name's Sam!
Come here, Sam!
I want you to meet Mother!
- Get out!
- Here, Sam!
Ooh! Get him out!
- Here, Sam!
- Oh, my paper!
Don't just stand there!
Try to catch him!
Here, Sam! Come on! Here!
Don't hurt him! Don't hurt my dog!
- Get him out!
- Catch him!
- Stop him!
- Catch him! Catch him!
- Oh, Sam!
- Come here!
Come here, boy!
I'll get him! He minds me!
- See? He loves you, Mother.
- I want that dog out of here.
- His name's Sam.
- Outside.
But I promised this man I'd keep him.
- What man?
- A rich man.
I told him I'd board Sam.
Why, Peter, an enormous thing like that would eat us out of house and home.
But we're getting paid.
You explained about everybody doing their share, and Sam's my share.
- I'm getting paid 25 cents.
- A meal?
- A week.
- Oh, no.
I'm sorry, Peter. We can't do it.
You'll have to take him back.
But I can't.
The man's already left town.
Oh, my goodness.
The man's gonna pay me the next time he sees me.
You mean you didn't get it?
- What happened to your hair?
- I got it cut.
And your eye. You've been in a fight.
- They called me a sissy.
- And where did you get those rags?
These aren't rags.
These are my working clothes.
- Working clothes?
- Ahem. Not to change the subject, but here's a special delivery letter for you, Mrs. Carey.
Special delivery?
Thank you.
- Hey, you ought to see me...
- Shh! Special delivery.
Oh.
What is it?
What does it say, Mother?
Julia.
She's coming to stay with us next week.
- Oh, no!
- Oh, please! Not Julia!
Oh!
Best leave these folks to their grief.
Come along, Lallie Joy.
Do I have to have to, Pa?
It's been real interesting here.
Yes, come along.
See you tomorrow.
Goodbye, Osh.
And thanks for everything.
And I want you two out of those dying gladiator attitudes.
Julia is your cousin, and a Carey. And
I don't want you to forget that, ever.
- Forget it?
- Nancy.
Try to realize that Julia's story is rather a sad one.
She never even knew her mother.
And after her dear father died, the Fergusons very kindly took her in and raised her.
Kindly took her in?
George Ferguson had a guilty conscience.
He knew those stocks he sold her father were as worthless as ours.
She's the Fergusons' responsibility.
Why dump her on us?
Because now George writes he can't keep her.
Another unfortunate investment.
Mm.
But there is one thing we're going to do. We're going to welcome her.
Really welcome her.
As a cousin, and as a young girl who has no other home to go to.
Well, we didn't really have a home for a while either.
But we didn't go around begging all our old relatives to take us in.
Have you both forgotten?
We had each other.
Julia doesn't know any of this and it would kill her if she found out.
So not one word out of either of you.
All right, Mother.
The more the hungrier.
- Find some place for that dog to sleep.
- There's room on my bed.
Outside.
Julia!
Well, I'll be nice to her for Mother's sake, but Julia's a pill.
Complete.
And she does think she's the pink of perfection.
# She's the pink of perfection
# From her prissy pink nose
to her custard complexion
# And eleven pink toes
# With a chin like a prune
# She's a dainty baboon
# And she thinks
she's the pink of perfection
# She's the pink of perfection
# Made of skimmed milk and rice
# She's a witch's confection
# Makes your blood turn to ice
# Like a stale Charlotte Russe
# With the charm of a moose
# And she thinks
she's the pink of perfection
# Never walked there a creature
# With features so fair
# Like a Lillian Russell...
# Without any hair
# She's a princess presiding
in diaphanous gowns
# With a face and a figure
that's the envy of clowns
# She's a knock-kneed gazelle
# With a voice like a bell
# And she thinks
she's the pink of perfection #
Gee, I can't wait to see her.
Here, Sam. Come on, boy. Come on.
Come on, boy. Come on. Come on, boy.
Here, Sam. Come on, boy.
Quiet, boy! Quiet!
You're not supposed to be in here.
But if you get out early in the morning and don't come in nights till my light goes out, you can always sleep with me.
Go to sleep now.
What a charming place, I don't think.
- What's wrong with it?
- Why, everything!
If one must have Maine, why not Bar Harbor?
This place is truly primitive.
- Sure is.
- Practically unsettled.
Of course, we don't see too many Indians nowadays.
But there's plenty of wildlife.
What kind of wildlife?
Oh, the usual.
Not too many moose. Some wild cats.
- Lots of bears.
- And the ordinary small stuff.
A wolf or two. Fox. Skunks.
- Snakes?
- Oh, naturally.
But only about one out of ten is poisonous.
So when we get bit we just have whiskey.
Even Peter.
Goodness, don't they even fix the roads in this backwoods place?
These aren't roads.
Just wilderness trails.
Rapids ahead! Hold tight!
Maybe we'll make it!
Hello, Peter. Let me out of this thing.
- She's not knock-kneed, Nancy.
- Shh!
Julia!
- Oh, dear.
- Aunt Margaret.
- Well. Welcome to the yellow house.
- Why, thank you.
- Did you have a pleasant trip?
- It was a nightmare!
No parlor car on the train.
And this wilderness!
When I think of last summer, the glorious time Gladys Ferguson and I had in Easthampton.
Come along.
But I must remember the last thing that dear Mrs. Ferguson said to me.
"Don't let poverty drag you down, Julia."
"Keep high thoughts and don't let them get soiled by the grime of daily living."
Oh, lovely. Especially the part about the grime of daily living.
- A pill.
- Complete. Utter.
I think she's pretty.
- Well, you go play with Sam. Vanish.
- Huh?
Scat!
Naturally, we dressed for dinner every night.
Gladys Ferguson's French maid laid out our dresses for us.
Really! We didn't have to turn a hand.
Aunt Margaret, I do wish you could see Gladys's wardrobe.
All her things are exquisite.
Nothing machine-stitched has ever touched her skin.
Everything hand sewn by dear little nuns in Switzerland.
Oh, and the dances, Nancy!
Did I tell you that Gladys doesn't know one boy that doesn't go to Harvard?
Yes, you did.
If you'll excuse me, Julia,
I have to get our boy to bed.
Come along, Peter. You're going to sleep with me tonight. Won't that be nice?
Oh, no, I can't!
Julia has to sleep in your room until we get another bed in Nancy's.
- Please! You don't know!
- Not another word.
Good night, Julia. Breakfast at 7:00.
- Good night, children.
- Night.
- 7:00 in the morning?
- Mm.
Good night, Aunt Margaret.
- But, Mother, you don't...
- Run along, Peter.
- Now, where was I?
- Ah, just a minute, Julia.
- Everything locked up tight, Gilly?
- Oh, sure.
- Ooh, dark tonight, isn't it?
- Inky.
- Wouldn't like to be out alone.
- Uh-uh.
- I remember when...
- Shh!
What was that noise?
- Sure you've got the bear locks on?
- Wouldn't dare forget them.
Oh, well, I guess we're safe enough.
Safe from what?
Oh, nothing, nothing.
But this is the wilderness.
Oh, well, I should think out here, nobody would...
Oh, nobody would.
- They're just after honey.
- Who is?
Well, I guess we've done all that's humanly possible.
Humanly.
Are you ready for bed? Or would you rather sit here alone and read a book?
Oh, no, I think I'll go up with you.
Hey, check the back door again, Gil.
Better be safe than sorry.
Right.
After you, Julia.
Who's there?
I tried to tell you!
I tried to tell you!
Julia! Julia!
Julia! Oh!
Julia!
Try to stop crying, dear.
You'll make yourself sick.
It was deliberately planned.
On purpose!
- They're all against me!
- Nobody's against you in this house.
We want you to be part of the family.
But we have a little boy and that little boy has a great big dog.
Nobody cares what happens to me.
- Julia?
- Oh!
I heated some milk.
I'll take it, dear.
See that Peter sleeps in his bed.
I'm keeping Julia here with me.
Yes, Mother.
Julia?
Good night, Mother.
Good night, dear.
How do you like that?
Pink of Perfection raises the roof and lands in a bed of roses.
Where's Peter?
I don't know. He's not in his room.
Peter?
Peter?
Come on. Bed, Peter.
You can sleep in your own room tonight.
- Sam too?
- No.
But if Sam can't sleep with me, can I sleep with Sam?
- He's had a terrible scare.
- Come on to bed now, Peter.
Nancy, Sam's upset!
I know.
Bye, Sam.
Very good. Very good.
You're gonna be a real carpenter.
Osh!
Look, Osh!
Hm.
He climbed up there all by himself.
He likes me.
Mm, that's a mighty handsome critter.
He has a very ugly face.
Maybe he's thinking the same thing about you!
You know, the little critters of nature, they don't know that they're ugly.
- They don't?
- Except one.
# Once a lonely caterpillar
sat and cried
# To a sympathetic beetle by his side
# "I've got nobody to hug"
# "I'm such an ugly bug"
# Then a spider and a dragonfly replied
# "If you're serious
and want to win a bride"
# "Come along with us
to the glorious annual Ugly Bug Ball"
# Come on, let's crawl, gotta crawl,
gotta crawl to the Ugly Bug Ball
# To the Ball, to the Ball,
# And a happy time we'll have there
# One and all, at the Ugly Bug Ball
# While the crickets
clicked their tricky melodies
# All the ants were fancy dancing
with the fleas
# Then up from under the ground
# The worms came squirming around
# Oh, they danced
until their legs were nearly lame
# Every little crawling creature
you could name
# Everyone was glad,
what a time they had
# They were so happy they came
- # Come on, let's crawl
- # Gotta crawl, gotta crawl
- # To the Ugly Bug Ball
- # To the Ball, to the Ball
# And at happy time we'll have there,
one and all
# At the Ugly Bug Ball
# Then our caterpillar
saw a pretty queen
# She was beautiful
in yellow, black and green
# He said, "Would you care to dance?"
# Their dancing led to romance
# Then she sat upon
his caterpillar knees
# And he gave
his caterpillar queen a squeeze
# Soon they'll honeymoon,
build a big cocoon
# Thanks to the Ugly Bug Ball
# Come on, let's crawl,
gotta crawl, gotta crawl
# To the Ugly Bug Ball,
to the Ball, to the Ball
# And a happy time we'll have there,
one and all
# At the Ugly Bug Ball" #
Osh. Mother wants you.
Not too hot, Lallie Joy.
Test it with your elbow.
Julia, you can't take a bath in here.
I'm tired of lugging kettles of hot water upstairs.
At the Fergusons', Gladys and I had our own bath, right next to our room, with plenty of hot running water.
This isn't the Fergusons'.
This is the Careys'.
Well, it seems to me that if the Careys are silly enough to spend money on a house they don't own, the first thing they should have done was to install civilized plumbing in this primitive place.
Well, really!
- Where is your ma?
- In the sewing room.
Primitive or not, the Careys are just as clean as the Fergusons.
- Close the door, please.
- Lallie Joy, you're not her maid.
Oh, I don't mind.
- Did you want me for something?
- Yes, Osh.
I've been figuring. Facing facts.
I hate facts.
Well, there's one very unpleasant one.
We haven't enough money.
And if we want to stay in this house, we won't be able to go on fixing it.
But, Mother, we haven't even started on the outside yet.
We'll have to live in it the way it is.
Oh, no!
There's no hurry about paying me.
We'll figure that out some day.
It won't do, Osh.
You're too kind. We can't accept it.
There's the second rent payment due Mr. Hamilton.
Mr. Hamilton. Rent money.
I clean forgot.
I got a letter. It's in my pocket.
No, I must have left it in my coat.
Did he get my letter about the improvements?
Oh, yes, sir. Yes, sir.
I put yours in with the one I wrote him about that time.
He was so darned overjoyed about what you were doing to the old house, you know, adding to its value, that he wouldn't even consider taking any rent money.
No rent money?!
- Mother! Won't that make a difference?
- We can't accept it.
- Mr. Hamilton is very...
- Hold your horses there, Mrs. Carey.
He wants a favor in return.
- A favor? From us?
- Yes.
He wants you to find a suitable place for his dear mother's picture.
- His mother's picture?
- Of course!
Dear old soul. Portrait of a lady.
- Where is she, Osh?
- Well... well, he hid her.
He hid her away some place safe.
He wrote it down real clear, but it's just gone right out of my head.
If you'll bring the letter, we'll follow the instructions to the last detail.
- She'll have a place of honor.
- That's the idea.
He wrote something about a simple little vase of flowers. On her birthday.
Of course. Her birthday. When is it?
Well, he...
Well, it seems like he said it was along the fall of the year.
- Halloween.
- Halloween?
- People are born on Halloween.
- It works out perfectly, Mother.
It'll tie in with our housewarming.
We could have a ceremony.
You know, candles, a simple bouquet, her lovely painting above.
- Probably by Sargent. Maybe Whistler.
- Sounds too good to be true.
There's Gilly now.
You see, Mother?
We were fated to live here!
- Mariah, I was uh...
- Don't try to stop me, Mr. Popham.
Well, of course not.
You making a social call?
I ain't feeling social, Mr. Popham.
I'm here to talk gospel truth to Mrs. Carey.
I searched the store for a letter from Mr. Hamilton and I didn't find one.
This whole thing's gone far enough.
Uh... Well, what are you going to tell the Careys, Mariah?
My suspicions.
Maybe it's why
I look on the dark side, living with Mr. Popham and him so hopeful.
Well, he certainly keeps our spirits up.
That's 'cause you don't get him steady.
Hopefulness at meals.
Hopefulness days. Hopefulness nights.
One everlasting stream of hopefulness.
Even as a boy, Mr. Popham always looked on the bright side, whether there was any or not.
His mother and father got terrible sick of it.
It's a wonderful faculty, seeing the bright side of everything.
Wonderful tiresome. I like to believe in a cloud that's a first-class cloud.
Thick and black clean through.
I get tired to death of Mr. Popham's silver linings.
We all believe in silver linings and rainbows. And...
Well, I don't. I always expect the worst and I ain't ever been disappointed.
- It's why I came today, Mrs. Carey.
- Is something wrong, Mrs. Popham?
My goodness.
Osh!
Osh!
- Papa!
- Mr. Popham!
- Oh, he's unconscious!
- Oh, speak to me, Papa.
Ossian, can you hear me?
Mariah.
Julia, go tell Gilly to get the doctor.
No, no, no! No, I'll be all right.
I'll be all right.
Just take me home, Mariah. It's my leg.
Crank her up, Lallie Joy.
This is for his head.
I'll be all right once I get home.
Oh! Be careful, Osh.
For his head.
That's it.
- Hold on.
- Take care!
- Good morning, Mrs. Carey.
- Good morning.
This is Charles Bryant.
He's to be our new school teacher.
- Mrs. Carey.
- We've been expecting you, Mr. Bryant.
You seem very young to be undertaking such a chore.
- He's just out of college.
- Oh, I love his name.
Charles Bryant. So dignified!
- He looks young to be a teacher.
- Isn't he handsome?
Aren't you sorry now you finished that elegant finishing school?
It might be the gracious thing to do if we asked him to tea some time.
Julia, that's an inspiration! How about today for refreshments on the lawn?
- Well, maybe a small affair.
- Yes.
Oh, we'd better ask some others so it's not too obvious.
But we'll start with him.
We needed new faces.
New ideas. And laughter.
Mr. Lord forgets what Beulah has given the Careys.
- A new life.
- Oh, thank you.
Oh...
Here are two more Careys. Young ladies,
I'd like you to meet Mr. Bryant.
He'll be your new teacher this fall.
- How do you do?
- Oh, Mr. Lord, you've forgotten.
I finished at Miss Somerville's.
Then, Charles, may I present Miss Nancy Carey and dear old Miss Julia Carey.
- My pleasure, young ladies.
- Excuse me.
Oh...
Mr. Bryant, my cousin Julia and I are having a little afternoon thing.
- Affair.
- Affair today.
- We do hope you'll be able to show up.
- Attend.
Attend.
And get acquainted with everybody.
- The thing's spur of the moment...
- Impromptu.
Impromptu thing. Affair.
And we do hope you'll be able to come.
Of course we hope that everyone will be able to come.
But first, will you?
- Oh, yes. I'd be delighted.
- Oh!
Oh. Julia.
Is it all right if Julia and I invite a few friends to the house this afternoon?
Why, I don't see why not, dear.
Oh, good. We'd have died if you said no
'cause we've already invited him.
Him?
Nancy and Julia have invited friends for a lawn party this afternoon.
- Will you be sure to come?
- Be happy to.
Good.
Now. Let's see which one of you ladies is going to be old Mrs. Hamilton.
Now, I've seen you some place before.
Ossian, dinner's on the table and it's getting colder by the minute.
Oh! Mr. Popham, what are you doing with them women? It's the Sabbath!
Well, looking for a work of art to take over to the Careys'.
They've got a lot of wall space there.
Hand me that old apron.
Can't take any of that junk.
She's got a kind face.
It's a pity she's got printing on her.
There's only one that's fit to hang.
Mrs. Griswold.
She wasn't much to look at, but she was a good woman.
Spent her life on the opposing side.
And if she hadn't went down in the wreck off Nantucket Light, the demon rum would have been chased off the New England coast.
A real martyr.
Insisted on going down with the ship.
Everybody else was saved.
Crew and captain.
Hm.
That's a mighty inspiring story.
Mariah. Relax and enjoy yourself today at the Careys', will you?
This is no time to go upsetting them with cold facts.
Very well, Mr. Popham. But the town constable will come in here one day, catch you up on your sins, and you'll spend your life in state prison.
Ain't you forgetting the town constable is named Ossian Popham?
Where's the cake knife?
Where are all the napkins?
- And where's Julia?
- Upstairs in her room. Primping.
Oh, charming. "We'll give a little social affair. We'll invite..."
Oh! Here he comes!
- Mr. Bryant!
- Oh! Miss Nancy!
You must be exhausted, peddling all the way from town.
Oh, it keeps me in condition.
All the same, I think you could use a nice glass of lemonade.
Oh, that sounds great.
I couldn't help noticing your Phi Beta Kappa key.
You must be terribly proud of it.
Oh, well, they're really quite common.
They're unique in Beulah.
I do hope you don't find yourself in an intellectual desert here, Mr. Bryant.
Ice cream, Gilly. Without anyone really to talk to, I mean.
- What did you major in, Mr Bryant?
- English Lit, but I...
Oh, literature! I love it! Poetry.
"This is the forest primeval, the murmuring pines and the hemlocks..."
- Here.
- Two scoops.
Ah... Oh. No napkins. I'll get them.
- Mr. Bryant?
- Oh. Thank you.
You're rather late arriving at the little affair we are giving.
Dear Nancy, you look so hot and exhausted.
Bathe your face and run a comb through your hair.
- I've been working.
- That's what I mean.
You look it.
Oh, Mr. Bryant, you shouldn't be standing out here in this hot sun.
I think we can find some shade.
Shade sounds great.
Oh!
- Oh, Nancy.
- Osh.
I've just remembered where old Mrs. Hamilton's picture was hid.
- Oh, where is she?
- Since I mislaid Mr. Hamilton's letter,
I ain't been able to sleep nights.
Then driving over here, it came to me like a ray of light.
She's in there!
- In the Dutch oven?
- Just like the letter said.
- Funny place to put your mother.
- The Dutch oven is cool and dry.
Wouldn't have harmed the old lady if she'd been put in there alive.
You'll be out soon!
A dear little gold football.
And to think that you won it!
Please tell me all about it.
Oh, that was the game when Dartmouth fumbled on our...
Well, I wondered where everybody was.
What do you have there, Julia?
A football!
"Brown University. Charles Bryant."
Brown...
You must be Bandy Bryant!
I've seen you play!
You retrieved the ball on the five-yard line, ran 90...
He knows what he did, Nancy.
I like to relive it. It was a glorious moment in the great American scene.
- Mr. Bryant...
- Here we have a renowned athlete sitting under a tree!
You're probably dying to be batting at something.
- Oh, well, I...
- I don't play football but how about a game of croquet?
Fine.
I can't wait till school begins.
I shall be taking literature.
- I have another turn now, Mr. Bryant?
- Yes.
I think I'll try for Julia.
- Your turn, Miss Julia.
- Oh...
Oh, dear. Nancy's so athletic.
- What am I doing wrong?
- May I?
Put that hand there. That one there.
Now you have a good chance to knock me away from the wicket.
Oh, I couldn't do that!
It's part of the game. Hit him!
No, no.
Like this.
That's right.
Oh, I really can't hit you, Mr. Bryant.
Oh, for the love of Pete, it's part of the game.
Is it?
Nice shot, Miss Julia... if a little out of bounds.
I won!
I won?

Well, after all the time she took primping!
She could have at least hung up her clothes.
What does she think she is?
A guest in this house or something?
# Hold your hand
and steal a kiss or two #
Oh, I thought you'd be in bed.
With your stuff piled all over it?
- You left this place like a pigsty.
- Did I?
Oh, you know, there's nothing like a college man.
Oh, I do hope you and your mother will scrape and save to get Gilly into a good college.
Give one member of this family a chance to amount to something.
- What did you say?
- I said...
I heard you.
I want you to know, Julia Carey, you make me sick.
I'm sick of Gladys Ferguson's clothes and her French maid and her lace and...
I'm just sick of all that blah blah blah about the Fergusons.
Oh, that's right. Tear my dress.
Pull the buttons right off.
It's only imported.
Oh, you're very imported.
But I'm tired of doing your share and picking up after you.
- Don't pick up after me.
- I won't.
Imported chemise. French silk.
Handmade shirt waist. English Lisle.
Crepe de Chine drawers. No, they weren't over there, they were over there.
Oh, I know what's wrong with you.
You're jealous.
Jealous? Me, jealous? Oh!
Why yes, because of Charles.
Oh, so it's "Charles" now, is it?
"Oh, Mr. Bryant.
I couldn't hit your croquet ball."
"I'm too weak and dainty."
"But I might take a weensy push at Big Jim Jeffries-Nancy Carey's ball."
Whack!
"Mercy! I only sent her 100 yards, but I couldn't hit you."
Hilarious.
If you knew how you look pretending to be dumb.
- I am dumb.
- Oh, no, you're not.
- I am so.
- Ha, ha.
Oh, I can see it's no use trying to talk to you.
You're a child, a jealous child, growing up like a hoodlum.
The Fergusons might make a lady of you.
- My mother hasn't?
- She hasn't succeeded.
Why don't you go back to the Fergusons?
They're so wonderful.
Oh, sure. They dumped you here with us.
They didn't care.
George Ferguson only raised you
'cause he felt guilty when he lost all your father's money.
If he hadn't lost my father's money, my mother might have a French maid and I could have imported dresses and Gilly go to college.
- I don't believe you.
- Oh, Julia!
I'm sorry. I...
Aunt Margaret!
Is what Nancy told me true?
- What's the matter?
- Mother, I've done a terrible thing.
I was mad at her and it just slipped out.
Tell her what you said.
Oh, Mother, you know what I said.
Nancy, how could you?
Julia, really, I...
No matter what Nancy says, the Fergusons love me.
Of course they do.
And we love you too, Julia.
And, dear,
I've had a letter from George Ferguson.
He writes that his affairs are looking brighter now, and they're ready to take you back.
Take me back?
I've put off telling you because I hoped you'd care for us as much as we care for you.
But it has to be your choice.
Oh, please choose us, Julia.
I do.
Oh, Aunt Margaret.
I don't want to go back! I'm happy here.
- Please let me stay.
- Please, Mother.
Oh, of course.
- Oh, Nancy!
- Julia.
It's all been my fault.
I'll do my share and I'll never mention the Fergusons again.
Oh, and my dresses. They weren't imported. I made them myself.
You did?
If I do all the dishes, will you help me with my dress for the housewarming?
When it comes to sewing, I'm all thumbs.
I have the most wonderful book of patterns. Gladys Fer...
I mean, it's from Paris.
The latest styles.
Really? A Paris gown!
Good night... sisters.
That's the best one you've done.
Who are you bringing to the dance tonight, Dig?
- Opal.
- Opal? I never heard of her.
- Must be one of your city giris.
- She lives on the other side of Beulah.
I've known her since about the first grade.
Funny thing. I always used to think she was kinda clunky.
Till I met some of those city giris.
You can have 'em.
Gee, Dig.
You liked the city, didn't you?
Well, it's like Pa always says.
The city is all right for city folks.
Second night I was there,
I wished I was back in Beulah.
Why?
I was walking along the streets and all these people were rushing by me.
And they looked like... like ants.
I could no more talk to one of them than I could talk to an ant.
Well, it's great you're home.
I guess you'll be wanting your job back, driving the truck.
No, I got a good offer to work down at the sawmill.
So the job's still yours.
Gee, thanks!
Well, we'd better be getting the rest of that stuff up here.
I remember, the night before I left...
I was talking to Pa about wanting to see city lights and the gals and all.
You know what he said to me?
Pa said, "'Mid pleasures and palaces, wherever you may roam, be it ever so humble, there's no place like home."
- He sang it?
- No, he said it.
He made it right up.
You know, Gil, if Pa had felt like it, he would have made a great poet.
Yeah.
Peter! No!
I was just trying to see what Mrs. Hamilton looks like.
Not till tonight at the ceremony, as we promised Osh.
Where are those giris? Don't they realize we have a million things to do?
You go back and carve your pumpkin.
I wish I was dead!
Lallie Joy, why do you wish you were dead?
- Look at it!
- Oh, my goodness!
- Lallie Joy!
- Where did you dig that up?
Ma made it. I'll just die if I have to wear it to the party.
Oh, it's not so bad. We'll just make a few changes and it'll be all right.
- Sure.
- You don't need this.
Right. Get rid of these.
- That's all too...
- Oh! My chest shows!
Too bunchy here.
- All right. Out of it.
- Oh, there's nothing to it.
We'll just have to start all over again, that's all.
Oh, my dress! What will Ma say?
Oh, don't worry about the dress.
It's what's inside that counts.

Knees together, now watch your feet.
You're not a duck!
Oh, Gilly, why don't you look where you're going?
I'm sorry.
I suppose I should have been looking.
Oh, I thought you were my brother, Gilly.
I hope I'm not intruding on anything.
Oh, no. No.
You see, we're having a party tonight in the barn.
Paying a tribute to Mr. Hamilton's dear old mother.
Oh.
It's the least we could do.
He owns the place.
Oh, he does?
Mm. Not that he ever cared much about it.
You should have seen the mess it was in before we took over.
- Took over?
- From Mr. Hamilton.
He gave us carte blanche, so this is a housewarming.
- A huge affair. Everyone's coming.
- Nancy!
- Right there, Mother.
- Well, I mustn't keep you.
I don't suppose you're stopping over in Beulah.
- Well, I hadn't...
- I guess not. It's just a little town.
- Nancy.
- I think someone's calling you.
Careful of the wheel.
About this thing tonight.
It's open house.
Terribly open.
To anyone who wants to come.
Friends, acquaintances, total strangers.
It should be a very interesting party.
Have fun.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Nancy! For the last time, we're waiting for all those things.
- Ahem.
- Be with you in a minute.
Quite all right. Thank you.
Important letter to a friend of mine.
Rich property owner here.
He lives in China.
Leaves me in complete charge of his affairs.
Big responsibility.
I've got to get this here off to Mr. Hamilton.
Then I'll take it.
Tom Hamilton?
Well, I didn't know you for a minute.
Well. Didn't know you was coming back.
You gave me quite a shock.
Thank you.
Um... I just drove by the yellow house.
There's some people out there.
Yes. Lovely folks by the name of Carey has been living there.
I see. How long have they been living there, Osh?
Well, not long, as you figure time.
Wonderful folks, the Careys.
They put in a new chain pump for that old wooden one.
Who gave them permissi髇 to live there?
- You did.
- I did?
I've never even heard of them.
Nobody asked me.
- Why didn't you write?
- Well, I did.
Yes, sir. I did.
I wrote you every week and kept you abreast of everything that was happening.
- I didn't get any letters.
- That's right.
You see, I didn't mail them.
Popham, what's going on?
Now just wait. Just hear me out.
You see, I didn't know how you'd take the situation and here was these nice folks that needed a house and they fell plum in love with yours and I let them have it.
I wrote you all about it.
Put 'em up here, where Mariah wasn't likely to look.
Here they are. The lot of them.
The ones I wrote and the ones that
Nancy Carey wrote you. Hers are on top.
I wrote you because Mariah was nagging me to get your permissi髇.
Nancy wrote hers from a grateful young heart.
I hope you read hers before you make up your mind what you've got to do.
Who's that, Mr. Popham?
Mariah, for once in your life, pray for a silver lining.
Mother, must I?
Yes, Gilly, you must.
Osh has been our true friend and he was pleased when he learned you'd be Lallie Joy's partner tonight.
Lallie Joy, Gilly's waiting.
- Remember now. Walk feminine.
- Talk feminine.
Go on!
Good evening, Gilly.
- Good evening, Mr. Bryant.
- Lallie Joy.
- Good evening, Charles.
- Mrs. Carey.
- Won't you come in?
- Charles! How's my hair?
- Fine.
- Well, how do I look?
Fine. But you said you should keep a man waiting.
Oh, did I say that?
Nancy, dear, you'll understand some day.
You've got plenty of time.
- I didn't think you'd even be ready.
- I'll never keep you waiting, Charles.
- Hi, Julia. Opal, this is Julia.
- How do you do, Julia?
Hello, Mr. Bryant.
No use standing around out here.
Party's inside.
Nancy? Nancy?
Everyone's over at the barn.
These slippers, Mother.
I told you they'd be too big.
Well, I'd hoped you'd grow into them.
Oh, Mother, you still think of me as a child.
I suppose I do.
Anyway, your guests are waiting.
A fine little fixer I am.
Everybody has somebody.
Not me, though.
Not me. Uh... not I.
There are plenty of young people.
You can join them.
Join?
It isn't the same thing, Mother.
I wouldn't have minded a year ago.
Even a month.
But... I don't know.
Somehow, I just have a different feeling, that's all.
Well, if you don't want to go in alone,
I'll send Gilly over.
Mother! Gilly's a relative.
I couldn't go into the ballroom with a relative.
No, I must go alone. I must do it alone.
Well, if you're sure.
Florence Nightingale. The Crimea.
Joan of Arc. Maid of Orleans.
Mrs. Pankhurst. Votes for women.
Don't take too long deciding which one you want to be.
Chin up.
Smiling, the boy fell dead.
Boy?! Oh, no, never!
I'd much rather...
# Walk feminine, talk feminine
# Smile and beguile feminine... #
Oh, allow me, please.
I brought along a friend of mine, Nancy.
- I don't think you know Tom...
- Oh, we've met.
I decided I couldn't afford to miss this party.
Should be a very um... interesting evening.
Well, to think that you know Osh Popham, the most remarkable human being.
Fairy godfather.
If it hadn't been for him, we wouldn't be in this lovely house.
I don't think Mr. Popham told me the whole story.
Oh, I know. He's so modest.
Self-effacing.
So I'll start at the beginning.
Where was I? Oh, yes, I remember.
Well, it was Osh, Osh, Osh, from the very start.
From the first moment we arrived...
- Evening, Clove.
- Well, evening, cousin.
Say, you're looking worse than I ever seen you.
I am worse. I'm horrible.
Well, that's not a fit mood for you to be in for a party.
I've got some nice applejack here.
This will fix you up fine.
There now. Take a swig of this.
Pull you right out of yourself.
Here's to the state of Maine.
Good evening. How are you?
Nice to have you with us.
Digby. Lallie Joy.
Oh, there's dear Osh.
- Who's that?
- I never saw him before.
City fella.
Osh. You two stay together. It's time for Mother to start the ceremonies.
Oh, yes. The ceremonies.
It won't amount to much.
It'll be kind of dull.
- Like to go out for a smoke?
- No.
I'm sure that I'll enjoy them.
Will you gather closer, please?
Friends and neighbors.
As you know, the Carey family would not be living in the yellow house if it were not for the generosity of Mr. Thomas Hamilton.
He has made but one modest request, that we hang the portrait of his beloved mother in a place of honor.
- Mr. Popham!
- Mariah. Don't say it.
- You look near to apoplexy.
- Mr. Popham!
Calm yourself. Here. Drink this.
And then I'll listen to you.
And now may I present my daughter, Nancy, who will unveil this lovely portrait.
- Where's Peter?
- I won't!
I won't! I won't do it!
I won't!
Mr. Hamilton, wherever you may be, ankle-deep in fetid rice paddies or splendid in a gay rickshaw, delirious with fever, or sated with oriental dances, we know your heart is with us tonight.
Amen.
Tonight, we're unveiling your mother, as per your request.
We have taken her from the oven where she's been hidden for so many years...
- Funny place, the oven.
- His mother?
Of course we're not going to keep her hanging in the barn.
No, we're gonna find a permanent place where she'll always be enshrined in our hearts.
No doubt some of you have heard me kidding about old Mr. Hamilton, calling him the Yellow Peril...
Well, that was only because
I thought that maybe the old gentleman might suddenly return, and snatch the yellow house right away from us.
Peter?
To light these candles, I give you a twig of rosemary... for remembrance.
This is a very special mother.
Ladies and gentlemen, dear friends...
Mr. Hamilton's mother.
She was a good woman.
Just where did you dig up that thing?
Reminds me, I forgot to ask.
How is your mother?
She's fine.
Having a whirl on the Riviera.
She wouldn't live in Beulah if you gave it to her.
That's why Father left the yellow house to me.
What are you going to do?
Oh, I'll see you later.
There you are.
Did you enjoy the ceremony?
- Well, sort of.
- I must admit her face was a shock.
Yes, it was a bit of a shock to me, too.
But I'm sure she has a heart of gold, don't you, Mr...
- I'm sure.
- I don't think Osh told me your name.
Hamilton. Tom Hamilton.
Hamilton.
That's a familiar sounding name.
- Tom Hamilton.
- Tom Hamilton.
Any relation to...
- Close?
- Very close.
Not our Mr. Hamilton?
Not the Yellow Peril Hamilton?
Well, I think you look more like a Yellow Peril.
Uh... what are you going to do to me?
Right now? Dance with you.
- And don't talk.
- Wasn't going to.
Well, Mariah, looks like that black cloud has a silver lining.
Didn't I tell you? Everything always turns out all right in the end.
We'll hit the tobacconist.
On Wednesdays he's got receipts from the State football pool stored.
We'll wait till the night watchman's gone.
We'll disguise ourselves and try not to attract attention.
We'll cut a hole in the window.
Keld will get a glasscutter and tape.
Benny will be on the look-out.
I know, I know.
We'll tape the glass before knocking it in.
Should anything go wrong, then do not run away from the scene.
Walk away casually, as if you had nothing to do with it.
Well, until the next time, Olsen.
- And that probably won't be long.
- I should think so.
Are you planning to mend your ways?
That would certainly be nice.
Do you have a match?
The same goes for you two.
I'll keep an eye on the three of you.
I'd love to put you back behind the "iron curtains".
- You don't fool around with me.
- My matches.
- Pardon?
- My matches, please.
I'm so sorry.
I was not going to... Sorry.
Never mind.
- Life hasn't been easy.
- Don't worry. Egon's here.
We've had a confirmation dinner.
That's quite expensive, you know.
And then Yvonne had the baby.
She had to stay home for four weeks.
And Birger started at school.
If Benny hadn't won at the races...
- I won 400 kroner.
- Take it easy. I've got big plans.
- Really?
- You can count on Egon.
- Cheers. We've missed you.
- Sure. But Egon's got...
- Quiet! How are things here?
- You still have a place to stay.
Conny has counted the days for the last two years.
- Customers.
- This early?
Your wife wanted you to call home.
Immediately.
If you're pulling my leg I'll...
Egon, you son of a gun.
Welcome home.
I think you've shrunk.
Didn't the bastards feed you?
- Are you tired?
- Not at all.
Just a moment.
- Could you spare a coin?
- Sure.
There.
I don't care if it's for old times' sake.
You stay away from that honky tonk.
Where do you get the money for that?
Free? There's no free beer.
And how can you bring the baby there?
She's fine.
She's sleeping like a little angel.
Of course I will. Just a moment.
A big bag of washing powder.
Two bunches of parsley.
How about some cake?
No, that was a stupid idea.
Keld. Benny. Let's have a meeting.
Keld!
You're not going upstairs!
PEDICURE
- Long time no see.
- You haven't changed a bit.
- You're a little pale.
- You'll have to fatten him up.
- Welcome home.
- Where's Ulla?
- At work.
- She's our starlet.
She's my fiancée... I'm her agent.
- How about a drink?
- No, no. Get lost, girls.
We have to talk business.
Come on, Keld.
- Yvonne is waiting...
- We have to talk.
- I knew it was important.
- Yes, of the utmost importance.
How would you like to be millionaires?
- What do you mean?
- I've got a solid scam.
- We could use some petty cash.
- Wake up. I'm talking millions here.
- Well, I better...
- Stop interrupting, Keld.
- It's an international deal.
- Pornography?
- Pornography?
- Ulla is going to shoot a film abroad.
- No, no, no!
No...
But it is bloody good.
Can I help you?
It's easy to get what you want.
Everything's arranged by topics.
This is the department for women and men, men and women.
And this is women and women.
And that's men and men.
And over there is our latest item:
Animals and things like that.
- What can I do for you, my boy?
- Donald Duck, please.
- I'll have to talk to my agent.
- What? With your talents and gifts?
- I promised to consult him.
- The whole world wants you.
Don't waste those assets.
What a broad!
She's got star quality.
That's what everybody's looking for.
Sorry.
The gentlemen get overexcited when they've been in here too long.
- Why, that's you.
- Yes. Do you want my autograph?
Police. Come with me.
We have to shape up.
We need more class.
I've studied international methods.
We had books and films in prison.
- I'll have to go home.
- And I have to see Ulla.
- This time they won't get us.
- Bloody good.
We always get our man.
Crime does not pay.
Better to stop at the start.
Let's drop the masks and the cards.
We'll get the crooks soon.
They'll be trapped.
There'll be no foul-up.
You claim that the man in the picture is your fiancé.
But he couldn't have taken the picture while he was... he was...
- How do you explain that?
- Self-release.
Mortensen. Yes, sir.
I'm interrogating a witness.
We've just finished.
I got some useful information.
I'll come right away, sir.
You can leave now.
And let that be a lesson to you.
You lucky bastard.
Did you get some new magazines?
- What did he want?
- I really don't know.
- He can't just...
- He was kind of cute.
You know this contract...
They've offered me 5,000.
- Forget it. I've got other plans.
- What plans?
We need more class.
We'll start our own business.
- How?
- I'll be a millionaire soon.
- Are you sure?
- You bet. Egon's got a scam.
- It's a very important job.
- But my case...
- I'll take care of that.
- I've got an interesting lead.
- What is this all about?
- This. The imperial centerpiece.
One of the Hohenzollern jewels.
It's the main attraction at the German Cultural Fair.
- It's worth 12 million kroner.
- What is it supposed to be?
The virgin of Lorelei is the center of the work. She's made of solid gold.
She has the Van Hauen diamond in her right hand.
Beneath her runs the Rhine with waves of pearls and emeralds.
Above her is a gold sacrificial bowl.
Emperor Wilhelm II is said to have kept his dentures in it.
This is not just about money, but also strong national sentiments.
We can't allow anything to go wrong.
It could have dire consequences.
The Minister has requested that one of my best men guard it.
- And that's you, Mortensen.
- Thank you, sir.
I have great confidence in you.
The Minister is following up on this.
God be with you.
All doors and windows are secure.
The main system has been checked.
There is no parking out front.
We have a clear view of the street.
And the show case...
In the hope that this will strengthen the bond of friendship between us, -
- it's an honor and a privilege to declare this exhibition open.
It's an entirely new device.
At the slightest touch the case will descend into a vault.
The alarm goes off, and the doors close.
The alarm will sound at the station and at the German Embassy.
I dare say that nothing can happen.
Who would attempt to steal it?
It's an easy job, Mr.. Mortensen.
You can monitor everything from here.
- Is that really worth 12 million?
- Shut up. Don't touch.
Forget it, Olsen.
- Why, Mr. Mortensen.
- You can't pull it off, Olsen.
- I beg your pardon?
- This is not a job for amateurs.
- You're totally mistaken.
- We're just looking at the exhibits.
- It's very interesting.
- It isn't illegal to be cultural.
Say, Olsen...
Remember that I'll be here all the time.
- Majorca? Are you serious?
- Yes, we pretend to go on vacation.
I've always wanted to go there.
But Keld never could afford it.
- Ulla is coming, too.
- No.
No women.
Women always screw things up.
- But I promised her.
- Am I not going either?
- And how about the kids?
- Please, honey...
It's the chance of a lifetime.
We'll be millionaires.
If I'm not going, Keld isn't going.
I have to put up with all this, and then I don't...
- All right, all right...
- Ulla too? Bloody good.
We leave Wednesday at 3:45 pm.
Benny will take care of the tickets.
I can't make it by Wednesday.
I don't have any clothes to wear.
- It has to be Wednesday.
- You can't do this to me.
No, no, no.
Try to understand.
We're talking millions here.
We have to show some class.
We need determination and courage.
Is it dangerous?
Then I won't let Keld get involved.
No, it's not dangerous.
But we have a lot to do.
- Every second counts.
- I'll go check my wardrobe.
- Timing is of the utmost importance.
- Pardon?
We have to be precise.
We'll pull it off Wednesday.
We'll be at the airport before they notice anything.
Everything must be planned in detail.
Each of us will get an assignment.
Benny will arrange the cars.
We'll need your car and Conny's.
- Keld, your job will...
- You'll have to go to the laundromat.
You have to go to the shoemaker's.
There are so many things to do.
- 9 minutes and 27 seconds.
- I can go much faster.
26 seconds.
13 metres.
They say the highway has to pass through here.
That car is a real banger.
- That's dynamite.
- Isn't that dangerous?
We make a hollow charge.
Then we just need a small charge.
- We'll try a hundred grams.
- Bloody good, Egon.
- Five grams should do the trick.
- Good.
Knippelsbro, 3:12, the water tower,
1:40, and the highway 2:20...
That's it.
Everything has been checked.
Synchronized watches.
And a schedule.
To be followed meticulously.
- Pardon?
- Any questions?
- Can I get perfume on the plane?
- I want my dividers.
- I have a geometry assignment.
- But we're leaving tomorrow.
- So you say. I doubt it.
- We must concentrate or fail.
- That's what I mean.
- Birger, please.
Let's see...
The girls will wait at the airport.
- Did you get the tickets?
- We just have to pick them up.
They cost 4,398 kroner.
- How much?
- Eight tickets: 4,398 kroner.
- Did you pay for them?
- No, are you crazy?
If we had that kind of money we wouldn't have to do this.
- Why didn't you pay?
- But how?
It was your job to get tickets.
Did you think they were free?
- I don't have any money.
- Then you could get some.
Of course.
I've got it. I'll talk to Ulla.
- Hansen, is Ulla here?
- Yes.
Just a moment.
I've been thinking about the contract.
Sign it and get the 5,000.
What a nice fur coat.
Where did you get that?
- I already signed the contract.
- Did you..?
I just had to have it.
You understand...
- Well?
- No go. Just a moment.
Hansen, for old times' sake...
Could we borrow, say, 4,398 kroner?
- 4,000 then?
- I never lend people money.
Then there's only one thing to do.
No, not that. No.
- I knew it.
- Are you awake already?
- Just go back to sleep.
- Goodnight, Birger.
You forgot something.
That's pretty smart, Birger.
Stop that racket.
You're waking up baby.
What are you doing here?
They got caught. As usual.
They tried to steal my bankbook.
- We just wanted to borrow...
- Would you rob your own child?
How can you steal from your own flesh and blood?
- But we're going to Majorca.
- Not for my money.
Don't talk like that to your dad.
We all have to chip in.
The boy is a minor.
As parents you manage his affairs.
That's settled, then.
We start tomorrow at 3 pm sharp.
Good night.
- What time is it?
No, it's 3:12.
- 13.5 metres.
- That's it. Quick!
Damn it. Hand me the hacksaw.
We'll have to cut again.
We'll never make it.
We'll just push it back up.
- The tape measure. Quick.
- Keld, the tape measure.
Come on!
13 metres.
Come on.
Touch the case, and you get this.
Ow! Dammit!
Stop whining, Benny.
- They should be here soon.
- They'll never come.
Your dad keeps his promises.
- We're over here.
- Am I too late? I feel sick.
Don't worry. I feel sick every time I go on a trip.
- Bloody good.
- I'm proud of you, boys.
- You're a genius, Egon.
- We're running 30 seconds late.
- Why are you stopping?
- We're out of gas.
What? I just got a gallon.
- What are we going to do?
- Hide it in the back.
Quick. Dad'll help you.
Sit down.
- You can't park here.
- No. We're going to catch a plane.
Can I see your driver's licence?
What's this?
Who set off the alarm?
I didn't see them.
I was outside, sir.
- I was writing out a parking ticket.
- Well done.
I told you.
90 degree backlash, defective brakes, worn-out tread, no brake lights...
Don't worry. It's all a mistake.
Probably just a prank.
- I'll have to call Bonn.
- Don't worry. It's okay.
I certainly hope so, Chief of Police.
Close the harbors and the airports.
Alert all police divisions.
The culprits must be found.
Keep me posted. Day and night.
I'm coming. Damn it.
- What the hell do you want?
- I have a lead. Look.
Why, this is pornography.
You wake me up to show me this?
- Come in here, Herman.
- Yes. What is this?
A picture of a naked girl.
The young man is...
- I'm not blind. But how...
- Self-release.
- How can this be a lead?
- Look.
- "To Benny. Love, Ulla."
- This Benny left it in the cellar.
- He's the one who...
- Who is he?
He is a member of the Olsen Gang.
The Olsen Gang is behind this.
Nonsense. This is the work of international gangsters.
I've already told the press so.
- But they are old offenders.
- We'll have to pick them up then.
Damn it. Go ahead, Mortensen.
Keep me posted.
Hurry up, Mortensen.
Goodnight, sir.
Take it easy, sugarpie.
I'm coming now...
Let's drop it.
Yvonne wants a divorce.
- Ulla is not feeling well.
- This is all your fault.
- Don't take it like that.
- You're a couple of nincompoops.
As soon as the women start whining, you get scared and give up.
Don't give up. The battle's lost.
But we can still win the next.
One for all, and all for one.
But we have to take action now.
- Bloody good, Egon.
- Follow me, boys.
BEWARE OF THE DOG
Come on.
It's too close to the police station.
POLICE PARKING
Help!
Help. Do something.
- Relax, Keld.
- Look him straight in the eyes.
Lie absolutely still.
Who goes there?
Bloody good.
Have you seen the papers, boys?
You've made the headlines.
Where is he?
Is he upstairs?
Tell him that I've had enough.
He stole the boy's savings.
And now he's abandoned the baby to go visit those whores.
You can tell him that I've gone home to my mom.
Everything's packed anyway.
"The chief of police claims -
- that this is the work of professional foreign gangsters."
"No Danish criminal would have the courage to commit such a crime."
- Mr. Bertelsen.
- What does that idiot know?
- Filthy bastard.
- As if foreigners were all that good.
- Never mind.
- We'll show them. Let's go.
Where is he?
Upstairs?
There he is.
Listen, Ulla. Don't worry...
- But, Ulla...
- You big baboon.
- What's the matter?
- I'm pregnant. You clumsy fool.
- Really?
- They annulled my contract.
I had to send the coat back.
It's all screwed up.
- But how..?
- It happened that night, you know.
I wasn't my fault.
The self-release messed up.
I think we all need a drink.
Cheers.
Yvonne told me to tell you
- What?
- She was quite upset.
- Relax.
- She's gone.
- She got the baby carriage and left.
- Take it easy, Keld.
The baby carriage?
Follow them.
There you are.
Stop, in the name of the King.
- Where are they? The Olsen Gang?
- Coming up.
Can you spare a coin?
We'll catch up with her at one of the train stations.
- How could she?
- Stop snivelling.
- Never let the woman be the boss.
- Don't put up with them.
We can't let them arrest the boys.
We'll have to do something.
Let's follow them, girls.
- Don't worry. He'll come around.
- No. I'll never see him again.
You can go get him.
I'll get them.
They are driving in a stolen car.
I still think it's a wild goose chase.
We have a strong lead in here.
We have our eyes on a colored man.
He's not really a negro.
More kind of swarthy.
- Floor it.
- It can't go any faster.
- Did you fill it up?
- Damn it, no.
- Fill her up.
- But quick.
That'll be 47.50.
- Do you have a phone?
- In there.
Hey! Stop!
There they are.
- Hurry.
- This old junk pile won't go faster.
- Boss...
- Let's do it.
- Can we help you, mac?
- Thanks.
- I live down there.
- It's probably this one.
- I'll try to start it.
- Thanks.
Thanks a lot.
There they are.
Now what?
- There's no gas.
- Lord have mercy...
In the name of the King.
- But that's not them.
- It's a good thing you came.
We'll arrange a roadblock.
It's a Mercedes.
License number AL 24 834. Over.
- Could I just go take a...
- Not on your life. Take a shortcut.
The cops are coming.
Mortensen speaking.
The car was empty?
Send your men out.
I'm stuck here for a while.
Find them. They're very dangerous.
Go get them. They are dangerous.
So shoot first, ask questions later.
It is a buck.
- Suck harder, Benny.
- It tastes like shit.
- Ulla loves you, Benny.
- She does?
Suck it!
What did the old man say?
Bang 'em first, ask questions later.
You are under arrest. Everything you say will be used against you.
You thought you were smart.
But you don't fool me. Get in.
This is H2.
This is Mortensen, sir.
I have just arrested...
That's one of us. Let 'em through.
That's the flying squad.
There they are. Stop them.
I've arrested a suspicious person.
He was driving a brothel car with no muffler.
He claims to know you.
What a scoundrel. Put him on.
Is that you, Mortensen?
Shape up. I can't be everywhere.
We have just arrested our suspect.
Open it.
Come on, Mom.
Stop it!
- That's our baby carriage.
- Do you have a receipt?
Receipt? No.
Come on, we need the baby carriage.
- It belongs to us.
- You have to produce the receipt.
Let's find Yvonne.
Is that really you, my love?
Look, children. It's Daddy.
Can you ever forgive me?
It's so good to have Daddy back.
Now we'll go visit Grandma.
- Do you have the receipt?
- The receipt?
- For the carriage.
- Why?
- The guys are waiting and...
- The guys?
- They want to borrow the carriage.
- Is that why you came?
- And I've been sitting here crying.
- But I...
- You just come to steal the carriage.
- We're going to be millionaires.
Tickets, please. Are you paying for the two gentlemen?
- Me? No, but maybe my wife...
- I don't know this man.
- But, honey...
- He claims to be a millionaire.
Birger and Borge,
I'm your daddy, right?
If you do not have travel documents you have to get off the train.
You cannot travel without tickets.
- What are we going to do?
- Let's drop it.
Never. I have a plan.
Get in the baggage car.
Mortensen speaking.
There is a train coming in, sir.
Stop. In the name of the King.
Faster!
- Faster, you imbecile!
- It won't go any faster.
- I've had enough.
- Shut up. It's not my fault.
I surrender. I have a wife and children to support. I'm innocent.
- I just want to go home.
- In the name... name...
- I'm tired of this foolishness.
- You lousy amateur.
- I'm going to be a father.
- You're just too dumb.
Drive it yourself, then!
- Drive, you baboon.
- No!
Help!
There's the ferry.
We cannot give up now.
This is the chance of a lifetime.
This is a dream come true.
We have suffered, sweated, and cried.
We have bled, fought, and toiled.
And we did it together. United.
Don't give up. The goal is in sight.
We hold the reward in our trembling, grateful hands. Just look at this.
Benny, come back to me.
We got a flat in Brondbyoster.
You disappoint me, Mortensen.
Your reports have been misleading.
And now you had a piano accident.
This is outrageous.
I've had to do your work.
I have even solved your porn case.
Mortensen, you're back on the beat.
I will handle this case myself.
This is the police.
What? A piano truck?
He wants to sell it for 5 kroner.
I just thought it might be stolen.
He needs money for a ferry ticket.
When does the ferry leave?
In 7 minutes? I'm on my way.
Get him. Dead or alive.
I found this package.
I'd like a receipt. For the reward.
TWO YEARS LATER
CRIME DOES NOT PAY
LAW AND ORDER
Run!
English subtitles: SDI Media
ALL MONSTERS ATTACK
Out of the way!
- Minya sounds like that.
- Minya?
Minya makes a sound like that car.
You're living.
I don't think he sounds like that.
It may not be that exactly, but it's like that.
Son, are you going home now?
Oh, father!
I've got to work late!
Be good until mother gets home!
Okay.
I'll be good!
What is it?
I found a radio tube.
You can't keep that!
Put it back!
Hey!
We're going to have to work a little later.
Hey, are you having any trouble with your kid?
What do you mean?
He just seems to be awfully quiet.
It's normal.
Really?
Well, it's hard to understand kids today.
We have to take a step back.
Everyone is so hard at work that we forget about the kids, huh?
Do you know of a solution?
I'll give up this life when i save enough money and move us out of the city, whenever that will be.
Get a load of this!
They found the getaway car of the crooks who stole •50.000.000 by the trains!
If it was by the trains, those crooks could have boarded them and be anywhere by now.
•50.000.000 yen...?
Hey, let's go play in that building for a while.
We shouldn't.
That building is closed.
I know how to get in there!
But... we could get in trouble.
There's no one in there.
All of the kids play here.
You were to wait for your mom...
We shouldn't.
Hey, let's go home!
We'll be alright!
Ichiro, it's Gabara!
Hurry, let's get out of here!
Sachiko, what are you doing there?
Oh, mother!
You know you shouldn't be playing around here.
Ichiro, you should hurry home.
Your mother will be worried.
Goodbye!
Hey, Ichiro!
I bet you stole that radio tube!
You're wrong!
I found it over there!
- Liar!
- It's true!
You can't find anything good there!
- Well, i...
- Give it here!
He did it!
But, i really found it over there!
If that's so, then go over and honk the horn on that guy's motorcycle.
That man is working!
He won't do it because he's scared!
Do it if you want this back!
I won't!
You're a chicken! Nyah, nyah!
You're a chicken! Nyah, nyah!
All units, the two fugitives wanted for the theft of
•50.000.000 from the bank are still at large.
Report to headquarters for new assignment, over.
This is car 11-5, roger.
Ichiro, are you heading home?
Oh, Ichiro.
You'll find the key in it's usual place.
What's that?
This?
It's a new toy.
I call it a TV computer.
- A TV computer?
- Yes.
What does this computer do?
Can it do things like homework?
It stores data.
But, hey... let me show you.
Just push this button and...
"Kids, the moon is 1/50th the size of our world. "
How about it?
Would you like to learn more about the moon?
What do you think?
The moon is a neat place, but there's another place that i'd rather visit.
Where is that?
Monster Island.
Monster Island?
Minya lives there, along with Godzilla,
Rodan and Kumonga.
All of them live there.
And they all beat up on Gabara.
Gabara?
What monster is named that?
He's someone that always wants to fight.
Oh, you mean that kid in school you call Gabara.
Was he picking on you again?
Today, he took away a radio tube i found.
Why don't you stand up to him?
I would, but he'll knock me down.
If he knocks you down, you just get back up and try again.
But, it's hard when you're small like me.
Yoichi, it would be great it you could put all of the monster sounds in here.
See you later!
I see.
All of the monster cries, huh?
What monster's voice was that just now?
It was mine!
What?
Is that all?
"Ichiro, do your homework before you play. "
"I left some cake in the cupboard.
I'll fix dinner when i get home. "
"Mother. "
With the signing of the world treaty, it now goes to the United States
Congress for ratification.
And now for some local news.
Police are still looking for the two men who robbed •50.000.000 from a bank.
Today, they were inspired by the clues left behind.
The criminals abandoned their getaway car in an alley, and police believe they may still be in the area.
The police will conduct door-to-door searches in order to track them down.
Ichiro, i don't understand what's happened between us!
I can not stay with you any longer.
Can you try to forget about me?
- I will only bring you sadness.
- Ichiro!
Computer, computer... take me to Monster Island.
Computer, computer... please tell me all you know about Monster Island.
Computer, go ahead.
What?
Oh, the antenna.
Where is Monster Island?
Computer, go ahead.
Yes? Yes?
We're going by jet?
We're taking a jet out of
Haneda Airport?
Ladies and gentleman, thank you for riding with us on
Pan-Am Airlines.
We will arrive at Monster Island on schedule.
Monster Island,
Monster Island this is Monster 1-5.
We are ready to make our final approach.
It' Godzilla... and Kamakuras!
Gorosaurus!
Manda!
Angilas!
It's Oowashi!
It's Kamakuras!
Alright!
Minya!
Come over here.
I won't do anything to hurt you.
Really?
You don't need to be afraid of me.
Thank you for helping me out.
Why did you come to
Monster Island?
I wanted to meet all of you.
Won't you father and mother be worried?
They're never around when i get home from school.
It's Gabara!
Gabara?
Let's go!
Is that Gabara?
It is.
He's very bad.
Do you ever fight?
I can't.
He's too strong for me.
Well, i'm the same way.
- What do you mean?
- We both have our own Gabara!
Mother!
Yes?
This is toy consultant Inami.
Is this Ichiro's mother?
Yes.
I hate to be a bother, but would you mind looking after Ichiro a while?
It's alright.
He just fell asleep a little while ago.
What's the matter?
I'll be home tonight, but an associate is out sick and i'm filling in for her.
I'm very sorry about this.
Thank you for doing it.
- It's the police.
- What's going on?
Hey, you know those crooks who stole •50.000.000?
The police think could be in this neighborhood.
Oh, my!
Hey, wake up.
Hey, it's time to wake up.
Where am i?
Where did i go? Where?
Hey, hey, you're right where you were when you fell asleep.
Oh, no.
Why didn't you let me stay asleep?
Why would i do that?
I was just about to be introduced to
Godzilla by a very special friend.
Who?
By Minya.
Minya and i have become good friends.
Hey, hey!
Don't you go back to sleep on me!
I just got a phone call from your mother.
She won't be able to make it home tonight.
Really?
Again?
They always do this to me!
Relax! Relax!
Your mother and father work hard to make ends meet.
I got it!
Why don't you eat with me tonight?
Is that okay?
Hey, you'll be okay!
Well, come over to my place for dinner.
Minya, come get me.
Minya, come get me.
Minya, come get me.
It's no use.
Oh, no.
Hey, Ichiro!
Come here!
Come here!
- Ichiro's a coward!
- What a chicken!
Is nobody in here?
I'm right!
Gabara may have taken my other radio tube, but he won't get hold of these.
I should have guessed Gabara would come here.
Over there!
Headphones!
I finally found them!
Quiet!
Stupid idiot!
How could you do such a thing?!
What did i do?
When you looked down this hole, you driver's license fell out of your pocket and the kid has it!
Get down!
Hey, follow that kid home and get your license back!
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Don't do that, you'll break it!
It's already broken.
It's okay for now, but if you break anything more... i'll never be able to sell it anytime soon.
I have my own driver's license.
Hey, hey, hey!
Why don't you take your toy license elsewhere?
Monster Island, Monster Island.
Monster Island, go ahead.
Monster Island, go ahead.
Mister!
You're interested in this car, right?
Well, i...
It looks old on the outside, but is runs good.
Would you like to speak to the owner?
Oh, this isn't you car?
Well, it's not, but i'm in charge of it.
How about it?
Let me show it to you.
- No... maybe later!
- Hey, hey!
What a cheapskate!
- Hey, Ichiro! Dinner time!
- Right!
Hey, what's the matter?
You haven't bad any meat!
I would... but it's not right.
What do you mean?
I don't want you to go bankrupt.
I won't go bankrupt over sukiyaki!
Did you sell your toy?
I think i did.
And for that, i'll make you my monitor.
Monitor?
I make a new toy, and as a child you can test it to see if you like it or not.
Well, can i monitor the sukiyaki too?
That's right.
Let's eat!
Hey, hey!
Gobbling you food like that is bad for you!
You won't be able to sleep!
Oh, that's right!
If you find that i'm asleep, don't wake me.
I'll be visiting Godzilla.
Godzilla?
Where is he at?
On Monster Island.
Minya is going to introduce me to him.
We're sorry to intrude on you.
What is it?
We're with the police.
We need to ask you some questions.
The car for sale outside, is it yours?
It is... but, isn't alright to have it out there?
No, no... that's not the problem.
Do you know of the criminals that stole •50.000.000 recently?
They may be looking for a car, and we wanted you to be sure to lock it securely.
Really?
Well, thank you for telling me.
Thank you.
We'll be on our way.
Let's go.
Thief! Thief!
Get away! Get away!
Thank you.
What do we do now?
I don't know how much longer i can stay here.
I'm hungry!
Hey, it wouldn't hurt to get some curry.
Hold it.
You held out longer last month when we were west of here.
I sure hope you can lead us back to where that kid lives.
I found him on the second floor of an apartment complex.
Alright.
Hey! Don't go to sleep!
Let's go finish this.
Hey!
Minya!
Gabara!
I did it!
Hi!
What?
It's you!
What are you doing?
I don't have any friends to play with.
Well, it's the same with me.
What brought you back here?
Well... i was hoping that you would introduce me to Godzilla.
Really?
I wonder where he is now?
You don't know where he is?
- I don't think he's very happy with me.
- Why?
Godzilla feels i should fight my own battles and start creating my own legends.
Wow, he's strict!
Oh, there he is!
Let's go!
Horray!
Horray!
Good luck! Good luck!
Go get him! Good luck!
Back up.
Back up.
Will Godzilla be alright under water?
He'll be alright.
He's very strong.
He did it!
He did it!
Godzilla is back on land.
Let's follow him.
Kumonga!
Godzilla's eve was hurt!
Alright!
Hurry!
Hurry!
Get going!
Get going!
Your breath isn't that strong yet, huh?
Well, Godzilla's just about to use his, and it sure is powerful!
Wow, that's great!
Look at that!
Godzilla is on the ground!
He did it! He did it! He did it!
What's the matter?
It's Gabara!
What is he doing?
Is he attacking?
Hey, let's get away!
But... Godzilla won't be very pleased with me if i run away again!
You can't do it!
Alright!
Minya, good luck!
Good luck!
Go get him!
Minya, run away!
Run away!
Okay, let's get out of here!
It's okay now.
I was cheering you on, but it's not enough against him.
Those are jet fighters.
The humans in them attack us whenever they pass over the island.
Hooray!
Hooray!
No, no, no, no...
I guess humans aren't the only ones who have to study...
That was great, Minya!
Stop squirming!
If you don't stop.
I'll use this! I'll use this!
Hey, see if it's clear.
Ichiro!
Hey, Kid!
What's the big idea stealing this?
- It's alright now, go get us a car!
- Right!
You're going to behave, okay?
Be quiet!
Stop your crying!
What kind of young man are you?
I'm a young man that's scared!
You just keep quiet!
- I'll take a bowl!
- Yes, sir!
Hello.
We meet again.
Are you still working this late?
It's been pretty hopeless so far.
Then you haven't found any leads in the investigation?
We've gone through this area, but the clues have been very scare.
I figured we would look around a little longer.
Hey, would •50.000.000 fill a bag?
Sure.
It would fill a bag about this big.
Damn!
What's taking him so long to get a car?
Just ignore me. Just ignore me.
Just ignore me.
Just ignore me.
Just ignore me.
- Minya. It's Minya.
- What?
You better watch out for Minya.
There's nothing to look out for here!
Minya... Minya... Minya... Minya...
Minya... Minya... Minya... Minya...
Minya! Hang in there!
I know you can do it!
That's it!
Minya!
This way!
Come up here!
Minya!
Hurry up!
I have an idea!
Hurry! Hurry!
This will work! When Gabara steps on that end of the tree, you jump on this end!
What will happen then?
It will send him flying!
Come on! Come on!
Come on! Come on!
Alright!
Let's do it!
Now!
You did it!
Godzilla, get him!
He did it! He did it!
He did it! He did it!
I knew Godzilla was the greatest!
Gabara's a chicken!
Gabara's a chicken!
Don't do it!
I'm on your side!
Stay back!
Somebody, help me!
- Help me! Help me! Help me!
- Hey! You're having a nightmare!
- Help me! Help me!
- Wake up! Hey! Wake up!
Keep quiet!
It's me!
It's me!
Stupid idiot!
What took you so long?!
Give me a break!
The tire was punctured!
The spare wasn't very good, either!
- I don't think that this...
- Do you have the car?!
The car is ready for us outside.
Your hankerchief...
Your hankerchief!
Are we taking the kid?
I'm not too keen on kidnapping.
Not his legs!
His hands!
We won't kill the kid.
We'll just take him with us.
He's going to be our insurance.
Sort of like a safety net, huh?
Grab the bag and let's get going!
Right...
- Hey, i...
- Hurry up!
Sit still!
Hurry up!
Damn, not another delay!
We have to hurry up!
Hey... you stay put, okay?
What's the matter?
Idiot!
Let me do it!
Whatever you're doing, hurry!
Godzilla feels i should fight my own battles and start creating my own legends.
Let me go!
Let me go!
You brat!
Stop!
Keep quiet!
Damn!
He's in here.
Let's get him and head for the car.
Hey, you check those rooms and see if he's in there.
Idiot!
Be careful, you idiot!
What do you expect me to do?
I'm not some animal that can see in the dark!
That's enough!
Come on!
- Hey, did you find him?
- No.
Damn!
- Where could he have gone?!
- He's not here.
Hey, you go down and watch the entrance.
I'll go check the second floor again.
Damn brat!
What's the matter?
- He's on the third floor.
- Good.
Hmm... this car looks kind of familiar.
Where have i seen it?
This is my car!
If this is my car, why is it out here?
This is strange...
What's this?
It isn't mine.
The thieves!
Well... i looked in my car and found a bag!
Yes, a bag!
I'm sure i didn't imagine it!
Damn!
You think you can get away?
Hey!
I found him! Hurry!
What happened?!
- Where are you?
- I... i'm here!
- But where is that?
- I'm below you!
You stupid idiot!
- Damn!
- What happened?
It's not broken.
Hey, where can i find him?
Up there!
Why didn't you tell me sooner?!
There he is!
Hold it!
Hold it, you brat!
Bastard!
Hey, stop!
Stop it!
Wait!
Here it is!
This is it.
- Uncle!
- It's Ichiro!
- Ichiro!
- Uncle! Uncle!
Get back!
Put your hands up!
- Drop the knife!
- Hurry up!
Hey!
Come here!
Put your hands in the air!
Come out here now!
- I'm sorry!
- Yeah, right!
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry!
Those two... Ichiro, did you catch them on your own?
Yes, i did.
It's all right... it's all right...
You did it, huh?
Good job.
- Go ahead.
- Oh, thank you.
I'm sorry.
You mother had to work again last night.
I won't do it again.
But... it's so we can live better, right?
Oh, my!
You and dad work any time you have to.
I'll be alright.
Breakfast was good!
- See you later!
- See you later! Be careful!
Boy, you faced the thieves on your own?
I wasn't alone.
Huh?
You weren't alone?
Who else helped you?
Hey, who helped you through the ordeal?
It was Minya.
Minya?
- See you later!
- Hey, Kid! Boy!
It's alright!
It's Minya... the monster.
I think i understand.
I think he believes that his ideas came from Minya.
- Believes...?
- Yes.
In a man's world, we have our god.
In a child's world, it's not difficult to view Minya as a divine guide.
Sachiko!
Did you tell your story to the reporters?
I want to see it when it's done.
Hey, Ichiro.
Will you join my gang?
No!
What?!
You're no good, Gabara!
I hate you!
Why you...!
I won't be bullied!
I hate you!
Stop that!
What are you doing?!
You shouldn't play with that!
Stop that...!
He did it!
Let's go!
Stop!
Hey! Hey!
Stop!
Father!
- Father!
- Yes, son?
Dad, do a favor?
Can you hold up that man?
- Huh? What's the matter?
- I made him angry!
- Huh?
- Hey! You! Stop!
You can't get away!
- Get going!
- Thank you, dad!
Hey!
Hey!
Wait!
I'm sorry.
What appears to be the problem?
- What kind of question is that?!
- Hey, what happened?
I've got paint all over me because of that kid!
- I didn't do a thing to him!
- I'm sure he didn't mean it.
Hey, Ichiro!
Mister, i'm sorry!
THE END
Who is the most self-reliant animal
made since the world began?
Who can be the most defiant animal
known to the world of man?
born with emerald eyes
so cold, so warm, so wise
within her kingdom lies
the world's arena
do we need to ask more than that?
you must know now it's a cat
but a very important cat at that
who's called...
Thomasina!
Thomasina
what are you thinking now?
Thomasina
what makes you so highbrow?
for I do think it very odd
if you are an Egyptian God
that the wee, little mouse
runs in and out his house
each time you blink or nod
Thomasina
though you may love to roam
Thomasina
don't go too far from home
there are beasties in the garden
who would never accept your pardon
if you left the jungle yard in
which we play
Thomasina
don't ever run away
Thomasina
come along with me now
Thomasina
though you've seen a
little bird leave the bough
Thomasina
even if it's a lark or dove, you
let them all fly away above you
but I guess I'll always love you
anyhow
Thomasina
come along with me now
Thomasina
I love you anyhow
Thomasi...
Yes, I am Thomasina.
This story's all about me.
I'm a self-made cat,
And here's the house
I live in
With the Macdhui family,
Whom I'd adopted when they first came here.
They started off by calling me Thomas,
But when they, well, got to know me better,
They changed that to Thomasina.
Humans are funny that way.
That the Macdhuis are a happy family
Is entirely due to me.
I made them what they are today...
Although I had to be murdered first.
Here's the scene of the crime -
Inveranoch, in Scotland,
In 1912.
And this is Mr. Andrew Macdhui.
From a cat's point of view, even before my murder,
He was a most difficult man,
Believe me.
His wife had died sometime before he came here,
So there was just himself
And Mrs. Mackenzie, his housekeeper,
And Mary, his daughter.
I'd moved in on them a few days after they'd arrived,
And on the whole,
I got on with them very well,
Though mostly because of Mary Macdhui.
She appreciated my rather special qualities
From the start.
Thomasina, there you are.
Of course I had this sort of thing
To put up with every day -
Fussed over, treated like a doll,
Being dressed up...
And over a fur coat, too!
Everything that happened to me from here on
Was due, in a way,
To a blind man and his dog.
Here they are now -
Tammas and Bruce.
Good morning,
Tammas.
Good morning, Mary.
Say good morning to Tammas and Bruce, Thomasina.
Good morning, Thomasina.
She's not in a very talkative mood today.
I have the same trouble with Bruce here.
He can be very reserved at times.
Isn't that right, laddie?
But what would we do without them, you and me?
Where are you going?
Oh, just to get some tobacco for my pipe.
Mind how you go, Tammas.
Och, Bruce is my eyes, lassie.
Come on, say goodbye to Thomasina.
Be good now, Mary.
Thomasina, it's rude not to answer
When you're spoken to.
Aah!
Hello, Geordie.
Oh, what have you got there?
I found him down by the loch.
I think his leg's broken.
He can't hop or swim or anything.
Oh, he looks fair sick.
Doesn't he, Thomasina?
Ah! Don't touch.
Why don't you go and ask my daddy to cure him?
Och, I don't know.
Do you think he would?
My daddy can cure anything -
Dogs and cows and cats and lions and pigs and...
Aye, but frogs?
And frogs.
Everything.
You take him in, then.
Och, I'm not allowed in the surgery.
You go, Geordie.
Well, if you say so.
I'm only saying I'm here against my better judgment, minister, that's all.
You'll be glad you listened to me, Dobbie.
Mr. Macdhui's a clever man.
Maybe so, but up till now,
I've never found much wrong with dosing Jock here
With Watson’s patent powders.
Ah, you must move with the times, man.
Macdhui's a man of science.
Aye. I Haven't heard tell much good of that.
Ha! Book learnin'.
Up at Kinkairale's farm, they're grateful enough to him.
Two hundred sheep cured of the foot rot
And not one lost.
Aye, you're a good persuader,
Mr. Peddie,
But farm beasts are one thing.
A man's pet is another.
You wait and see.
Och, I'll give him a try.
No one can say
I'm not a fair man,
But it's for him to convince me.
How old is this dog,
Mrs. Laggan?
Fifteen years and a bit.
I've had him since he was a puppy,
The year my husband died.
He's been ailing a wee bit this past year
But not so sick as this.
Well, he's very old.
The kindest thing would be to have him put to sleep.
Oh, no. You see how bad he is with the asthma.
The poor dog can hardly breathe.
He's in pain, Mrs. Laggan.
But you can't put Rabbie to sleep, Mr. Macdhui,
Or I wouldn't have come.
He's all I have in the world.
Couldn't you give him a wee bit of medicine
To tide him over till he's well again?
There is no medicine that can make him well.
He's very old, he's in great pain,
And his life is a misery to him, can't you see?
But I can't lose him.
What would I do without him?
Poor Rabbie.
Be fair now. It's yourself you're pitying, not the dog.
Oh, dear.
I don't know what to do.
I've told you what I think is for the best.
Now I've told you it's up to you
To make up your mind.
Very well.
I suppose if he is suffering...
You'll be gentle with him?
He won't feel a thing.
He'll just go to sleep.
Willie?
Fifteen years.
Poor Rabbie.
Poor Rabbie.
You're doing the right thing.
It's for his sake.
Oh, no, there'll be no charge.
Just leave him here with me.
You're leaving Rabbie to be cured, then, Annie?
Mr. Macdhui says there's no cure.
He's to be put away.
now, Mrs. Laggan, that's a shame.
No cure for him?
If it was my dog, I'd want a second opinion, I'm thinkin'.
I'll go with you, Annie.
Good day to you,
Mr. Macdhui.
Good day, sir.
Good day.
Who's next, please?
Please, sir, Mr. Macdhui?
Uh-oh. Who are you?
Geordie Macnab, please, sir.
I'm a bit of a friend of Mary's.
I found him down by the loch.
He's hurt his leg.
Can you make him better, please, sir?
No one can cure a hurt frog, Geordie.
You put him back where you found him.
But he might die.
Could you not mend his leg, please, sir?
No, nature's the only doctor can do that, laddie.
Come on, now.
Come on, off you go.
I'm busy.
You've lost another customer, Andrew.
Is there really nothing you can do
About old Mrs. Laggan's dog?
No, not a thing, just put it out of its misery.
Well, whoever's next,
Will you come in, please?
Oh, it's all right,
Mrs. Campbell.
You go in ahead of me.
I'm in no hurry.
hey, there's Geordie.
What have you been doing in there?
I took my sick frog to Mr. Macdhui.
Oh, aye.
What did he say, then?
He wouldn't even look at him,
And he's going to kill
Mrs. Laggan's Rabbie.
Kill him? Rabbie?
Aye, I heard him say so.
It's just like grandfather says about him -
He's only good with farm beasts.
He's not interested in people's pets.
A frog Will die if he can't hop or swim.
I'm not going to let him die.
What are you gonna do, then,
Cure him by magic or something?
Come on, Jamie.
Why don't you take your frog
To the witch woman livin' in the Glen?
She's supposed to do magic.
Well, why don't you?
Our mother says the witch woman's crazy
And we're not to go up there.
Och, you're just afraid, the pair of you.
I'm not afraid of anything, and neither is Geordie.
Are you, Geordie?
Right. Let's take the frog to her, all three of us.
I dare you.
Very well.
Geordie, we'll all go.
You want to get your frog cured, don't you?
We don't have to tell mother we went.
I was only joking.
No, you weren't.
You dared us.
I think you're afraid to go.
Me, afraid?
Let's go now.
Come on.
Keep up with us.
You'd think they were all telling on us.
Aye. Are you afraid to go on, then?
No.
Well, come on.
Whisht! Listen.
It's the witch singing and banging a drum.
She is crazy.
I want to go home.
When you've got this far?
What about your frog?
Put your box under the tree and ring the bell.
Aye, go on, Geordie.
We'll wait for you here.
No, no! Go on, Geordie. Go on.
Come on, Geordie.
Go away. Go away.
Go away. Go away.
Larry, come back here.
Oh, your leg is broken.
You poor wee thing.
Has somebody brought you up here to be cured
By the mad witch in the Glen?
Eye of newt and hair of dog,
Give me the power to cure the frog.
listen. Magic.
Off to my cauldron.
Where is my broom?
Och, you poor wee thing.
I don't know why
I bother
To dose that dog of yours.
The worst thing that's wrong with him is his owner.
Don't give him sugar.
Aw, but he has a sweet tooth, Andrew.
Poor old Finn.
Look how pleased he is.
You think more of his affection and gratitude for you
Than you do of his health.
All you people with pets are the same.
That's why he's too fat, poor brute.
"brute," he calls you, Finn.
Oh! That's part of the reason
Why folks here are slow to accept your doctoring.
You show no feeling for the sick animals you treat,
The animals they love.
Are sentimental about, you mean, to the point of not knowing
What's best for them, like you and
Mrs. Laggan who was here just now.
Poor old Annie.
Poor old Annie.
Poor old brute of a dog, you should say.
You thought I was hard on her just now, didn't you?
My job is to relieve suffering in animals.
The tribulations of the soul
I leave to you.
She'll get over it, angus.
Aye, but when someone you love dies,
Something of yourself dies, too.
You think you have to tell me that?
Oh, I'm sorry, Andrew.
Forgive me.
That dog of hers was all old
Annie Laggan had left to love.
At least you're not alone.
No.
Look at her now.
Thomasina, where are you?
Thomasina?
Be careful.
It's the jungle.
It's a million Miles thick.
It's full of lions and tigers.
Thomasina!
Thomasina, come back!
Have you lost something, Mary?
Shh! We're hunting lions.
Lions? Here?
Geordie, where's your frog?
Did daddy cure him?
No, he wouldn't try.
We took it to the witch in the Glen.
You didn't. I did. We all did.
You saw her?
Is she a real witch?
Aye, we saw her chant magic over the frog
And take it into her house.
Did you speak to her?
Och, no. She's queer in the head.
She's got a big drum in the house.
She bangs on it and sings awful weird.
There's all kinds of animals there.
Did she fly on a broomstick?
Well, not exactly fly.
But she had one, though.
Weren't you afraid?
Well, I wouldn't recommend just anybody goin' up there.
You were afraid.
You made Geordie take the frog to the tree.
That was you.
I wasn't afraid.
You must be awful brave.
I am... A bit.
Uh... Remember, angus,
Just keep him off the sugar.
Well, I can try.
Hello, Mary.
Geordie Macnab took his frog you wouldn't cure
To a witch who does magic and flies on a broomstick.
She could have turned him into a frog,
And it would have been all your fault.
Mary, Mr. Andrew,
I'm waiting for you.
Come on, now, inside.
Wash your hands.
Thomasina!
Never mind Thomasina.
Dinnertime!
Come on, now, inside.
Wash your hands.
There's a good girl.
That's enough about witches.
Mrs. Mackenzie Will tell you the same as me -
There aren't any outside of storybooks.
Oh, yes, there are.
She been making up more of her fairy tales?
I didn't make it up. There is a witch in the Glen.
Och, the Glen.
She bangs a big drum in her house.
And lives with wild animals and rides a broomstick.
Jamie Macnab told me.
He and Hughie and Geordie saw her.
They're filling your head with nonsense.
And for the hundredth time, Will you not feed that cat at the table?
Especially with meat.
She likes meat, and there is a witch.
Now, Mary...
It's a poor wee soul called Lori Macgregor
That's rented a croft in the Glen from Mr. Peddie.
She spends most of her time weaving on a handloom.
That's the "drums" your friends heard.
Now what do you say?
She's a witch.
She's a wee bit weird, that's true enough.
It seems she's a lassie
That doesn't mix with other folk,
But, mind, she's not been there long.
Some of the shepherds in the Glen say
She has a rare way with beasts and birds and that.
Now, mind Thomasina doesn't spill her cream.
Cream?
Oh, just a wee drop,
Mr. Andrew.
It helps her to see in the dark.
She told me so.
Didn't you, Thomasina?
There, you hear?
Ask her if she'd like me to go out and get my rod and catch her a salmon.
Thomasina...
She says, no,
She'd rather go to the store on market day
And choose her own fish.
Aye.
Come on, now, no more talk about witches or magic.
Just say your prayers, get into bed.
And look after mummy in Heaven and us down here,
Especially daddy and Mrs. Mackenzie
And Willie and Geordie and Jamie and Hughie and Tammas and Bruce
And Geordie's frog and Thomasina and me.
That's all till tomorrow.
Yours truly, Mary. Amen.
Good night, yours truly Mary.
Slippers?
Up. In you get.
There we are.
Good night.
Good night, daddy.
Thomasina.
I've told you about that before, my bonny.
You mustn't keep that cat on the bed at night.
There.
Oh, please let me have her.
No, you can have your doll if you like.
I don't want my doll.
Please.
She must go out and you must go to sleep.
Go on, lie down.
There's a good girl.
Good night.
Good night.
Good night, Thomasina.
You know.
Yes, I knew,
And Macdhui didn't.
This being put out for the night
Was just nonsense.
I could get in again anytime I wanted to.
Mary and I had it all worked out.
It was as easy as that.
Thomasina.
Thomasina, come on up.
But not tonight.
I'd remembered it was Wednesday,
The night before market day.
They set up the stalls at dawn,
So Wednesday's always my night out.
And just when I was beginning to feel like breakfast,
The market was getting ready to provide it.
Fish, fresh fish,
And the best sauce for it -
The danger of helping myself...
...Which needed cunning and caution,
A lot of caution...
And speed!
You, get out of the way!
Get out!
Mary?
Mary, come and have your breakfast.
What's the child doing?
Mary!
I can't find Thomasina.
I've looked everywhere.
She can't be far away.
Come on, now, sit down.
She didn't come home last night.
For what we're about to receive,
May the lord make us truly thankful.
Amen.
I'm not hungry.
Daddy, she must be lost.
Of course not.
Cats don't get lost once they've decided to move in on people.
She's just had a night out and hasn't come back yet, that's all.
She's been out all night before,
But she's always come back.
She climbs up the tree and gets in my window.
What?
She always has.
It's our secret.
Aye, it certainly is.
Well, I'm off to the surgery now.
Be a good girl.
Eat your breakfast.
Don't worry about the pussy, child.
But she's lost.
Thomasina's too clever to get lost.
You do like her, don't you?
Aye, of course.
Would you do anything for her if I asked you to?
Promise?
Aye.
Well, let me go and look for her now, please.
You promised.
You're even craftier than
Thomasina, you wee monkey.
We'll split up.
Mary, you come with me.
Hey, what are you lookin' for, son?
A lost cat.
Have you seen one?
Not at my stall. Away you go. Go on. I'm busy.
She's a big... Mrs.
Macfarland, what would you like?
Nice cabbage.
Have you seen a lost cat?
Thank you very much.
Drat the cat!
Och, it's not Thomasina.
But never mind.
We'll find her.
Hughie, Mary,
I've found her!
She's here, Mary!
Oh, Thomasina.
Give her to me.
I don't think anything's broken,
But she's terribly stiff.
Oh, poor Thomasina.
I couldn't help it, constable.
He walked right in front of me.
it looks like Bruce.
Bruce? My Bruce?
What's all this about?
Och, Mr. Macdhui.
You're just here in time.
It's Tammas' Bruce.
Where is he?
Steady now, Tammas.
Steady.
He's fair crushed, sir.
I couldn't help it,
Mr. Macdhui.
Better get him back to the surgery - quick.
Bruce is my eyes,
Mr. Macdhui.
Can you save him? I'll do what
I can. Stay with him, angus.
He's in good hands now, Tammas.
Now, come on, you come with me.
This is going to take a long time.
I hope his heart
Will stand it.
Are you ready?
The Spencer wells, Willie.
How is he, Willie?
He's doin' fine.
What are you children doing?
Mary, go away from here.
Daddy, it's Thomasina.
She's hurt.
Go away, child.
Please look at her.
She's awful sick.
Here, Willie, take this cat.
Daddy, daddy, please look at her. Please make her well.
Mary, you mustn't stay here.
Now, listen to me.
I've got blind Tammas' dog here. He's badly hurt.
Well, so is Thomasina.
If you only look at her!
All right, I'll look at her, but go away, all of you.
You'll make her well?
You promise?
Yes, I promise, but go on out.
Come on.
Out, all of you.
I think you better look at her, sir.
Not now, man.
We got work to do.
Mr. Macdhui, sir, look.
Quick, get her out of here, and that cloth she's laying on.
That cat has tetanus.
Get her out of here.
Deal with her, disinfect your hands and hurry back.
But, sir... Mr. Macdhui, you promised the child.
The cat is beyond help.
Will you do as I tell you?
Hurry up, man.
We've the dog to seal.
Aye, I Will.
I Will.
Nearly an hour already.
How much longer can it be?
Aye, the waiting is hard.
Well, Bruce Will live, Tammas.
He'll even walk again.
Thank God.
Take me to him.
Not now.
He's still unconscious.
But I'll send Willie round to fetch you this evening.
Bruce Will know you then.
And he'll get better?
Aye, be as good as new.
It's a great skill you have, Mr. Macdhui,
And no one can deny it.
There now, what did I tell you?
Come on, Tammas,
I'll take you home.
God bless you,
Mr. Macdhui.
God bless you.
His pulse rate's fine.
I'll stay with him till he wakes.
Aye, he'll do.
I never thought to see such a surgery as that.
Aye, and what you have to do now
Will be just as hard,
I'm thinking.
You have to tell the child about her cat.
"the shoeblack tries his bread to earn
"and would an honest penny turn.
"when mud upon our boots leave stains,
"his ready help good payment gains.
The beefeater we see today... "
Daddy, Thomasina - is she better?
She's out of pain, Mary.
What was wrong with her?
Let me go to her.
She is better, isn't she?
Mary, uh, now,
Will you listen?
Listen to me just a minute.
You see, there are some things
That you have to learn to face,
Even if at first they seem a bit unfair.
Where is she?
Thomasina's wound was poisoned,
And she might have made other people's pets ill, even die.
But you did save her?
I- I couldn't, Mary.
I couldn't.
See, there are some things your daddy can do and some things he can't.
What did you do to her?
I, uh, had her put to sleep.
There was nothing else
I could do.
Now, try to understand, Mary.
No! No! You said you'd make her better.
You promised! You promised! Come on, Mary...
I'll never speak to you again! Mary, please...
He promised, and he's killed Thomasina!
She's dead!
I'll go up to her.
Aye.
And take everything she was wearing when she found the cat.
Everything, do you hear?
And burn what you can't boil.
I didn't realize she was going to take it so hard.
Could you not have saved the cat?
It was wounded, infected with tetanus.
I did what was right.
I'll get her another cat.
Can't I?
Well? Can't I?
Well, I'll buy her anything she wants.
Why did she take it so hard?
For a clever man,
You've an awful lot to learn.
Don't be so sad.
You'll do yourself harm.
Look, I tell you what we'll do.
We'll give Thomasina the best funeral any cat ever had, won't we?
Aye, with a full service and everything.
My mother's got just the right box
That'd do fine for a casket.
We could pick some flowers and have a procession,
Like when Old Dougal was buried.
Everyone in the village would see us.
Aye, you'll wear widow's mournings
And walk behind the casket, weeping.
And Annie here, she can be chief mourner.
I can cry awful loud, Mary.
not now.
Will I wear a hat and a black coat?
Mrs. Mackenzie has one.
Aye, we'll all dress up and get everyone to come.
I know! Jamie's just learning the pipes.
He's not very good... I can play Macktintosh's lament!
I'll wear my dress kilt with my skean dhu and sporran,
And everyone in the street Will say,
"there goes the poor widow Macdhui,
"a-burying of her dear Thomasina,
Foully done to death,
God rest her soul. "
Will they? Really?
Aye. It'll be a great, great procession.
You'll see.
We'll go and get Thomasina now!
Aye, come on.
I opened my eyes,
And where was I?
They say that to die
Is a Journey from light into darkness,
But here was light again.
This was no quiet endless sleep.
I was flying,
Flying wildly,
Without weight or effort,
Diving, spinning,
Falling backward and downward
Into the mists of time,
Where my ancestors were worshipped
In the temples to bast
Thousands of years ago.
Bast, the cat goddess,
The goddess with the golden eyes
Staring and staring,
Drawing me upward and upward
And upward and upward.
Then there were flowers,
Flowers everywhere,
All around me, touching me,
And the sound of music
Wild enough to wake the dead.
playing
"mackintosh's lament")
Lord sakes,
What are the children a- burying today?
Mary Macdhui's cat
Thomasina.
My grandson Hughie told me
Her father couldna be bothered to cure its sickness.
His own daughter's pet.
Ah, well, maybe he was busy at the time,
You know, what wi' Tammas' dog,
And after all, it's a blind man's eyes.
His own daughter's pet.
It's hard to understand.
Right.
This is far enough.
Put it here.
Now get some stones and build a cairn for the grave.
Now get the coffin off
And put it down just there, you two.
Come on, hurry.
Now get some stones.
Come on, get some stones.
That'll do fine.
Now, let's get on with the service.
I'm going to take the service.
It was my idea.
No, you're not.
I'm the oldest, and I've come prepared.
Brethren, friends, and fellow mourners...
och! Go on, then.
We have come here today
To bury Thomasina and to praise her.
She was the friend of Mary
Macdhui here, who you all know.
Uh, eh, well, anyway, there she is.
Shh! Not yet.
Hold your noise.
Thomasina was one of the best cats in all Argyllshire,
And we all feel for her best friend and owner.
Whisht!
Not yet, not yet.
There is no doubt that Thomasina was a terrific mouser, too.
She had a few faults, aye,
But I won't mention them here.
Uh, and her mortal remains
Will now be laid to rest.
Now!
playing "the Bonny Banks
O' Loch Lomond")
by yon bonny banks and by yon bonny braes
where the sun shines bright on Loch Lomond
where me and my true love
Will never meet again
on the bonny, bonny banks of Loch Lomond
oh, ye'll tak' the high road and I'll tak' the...
It's mad Lori.
and I'll be in Scotland afore...
It's the witch!
She's coming for us.
Run for it!
Run quickly!
She's a witch!
Run for it!
The witch!
The witch!
What were they doing?
Your heart's still beating.
Oh, poor thing.
Didn't they know?
You come with me.
Mary, come on in and get your supper.
Hello, Mary.
What have you been doing all afternoon?
Mary, your father's speaking to you.
Mrs. Mackenzie,
I've seen the witch
That lives up in the Glen.
What?
We all ran away from her...
Hughie and Geordie and
Jamie and Jock and Annie.
What's this nonsense now?
And what were you doing in the Glen?
And she is a witch.
I've seen her.
So there.
Mary, the... The kittens that
Mr. Peddie's cat Amanda had
Are now ready to leave their mother.
Would you like to come and choose one for yourself?
Mary!
Would you like to come
To Mr. Peddie's with me tomorrow
And choose a kitten?
Jamie Macnab can play
"mackintosh's lament" on the pipes
With only nine mistakes.
Answer me, Mary.
Answer your father, child.
But he's not very good at "Loch Lomond. "
This is ridiculous.
If this is her way of sulking just because...
Don't you want your supper?
No, I do not.
Now who's sulking?
Tell miss Macdhui if she does want a kitten, she'll have to come and ask me.
Everybody was real scared when they saw the witch, except me.
I wasn't.
I just looked at her and said,
"I'm not afraid of you. "
Oh, give me strength.
Oh, you and your stories.
Eat your supper.
Now you've made your father angry.
No, I Haven't.
My father's dead.
by yon bonny banks
and by yon bonny braes
when the Moon...
bright on Loch Lomond
Don't cry, child.
I Haven't seen you cry for a long, long time.
Look, Mary, I'm sorry about Thomasina.
I've told you.
I'll get you another cat,
Or maybe a wee dog to be all your very own.
Wouldn't you like that?
Now, look, child, I can't bring Thomasina back to life.
What's done is done!
Oh, very well.
Good night, then.
Oh, granddad, don't keep on about it so.
That cat's funeral was nothing but a children's game.
Not to some of us.
I'm tellin' you...
I've said it before and I'm saying it now -
That Mr. Macdhui is doing no good here.
Now, don't interrupt me, woman.
He's a townsman, not a highlander.
He has no feeling for animals at all.
Oh, come now, granddad.
Some of the farmers round...
The farmers?
Did you not hear that he made an order
To destroy the whole herd of Ian Macclennen's cattle
Because one cow was sick?
That's the law. They had foot-and-mouth disease.
It wasna the law in my day,
And it was only Macdhui's opinion that they had it.
and look at his record.
Never mind the cattle.
Annie Laggan's old dog Rabbie
- he had him killed.
He saved blind Tammas'
Bruce, though.
Oh, aye, that was because everybody was there watching.
That was just showin' off.
Now, granddad, you shouldn't say that.
Well, the man that did what he did...
And he wouldna even take the trouble
To treat his own daughter's cat when it was sick...
Is no better than a murderer.
It'd be a good thing if he went away.
I'd make it too hot for him here,
I'm telling you, if I was younger.
So would others.
Him and his newfangled science.
Mary!
Mary Macdhui!
Are you coming out to play?
Mary!
She won't be comin' out today. She's in mourning.
And anyway, we've got work to do.
What work?
Forming an anti-Macdhui society
To drive him out of Inveranoch.
Och, listen to him.
My grandpa said he's no better than a murderer.
Your grandpa?
And he told me Mr. Macdhui
Had two whole herds of cows slaughtered
Because he thought one beast was sick.
People are saying he ought to go, and I think we ought to join them.
And what does blind Tammas say about him?
Och, he's only one.
Now, here's what we'll do.
Me and you, Geordie...
Morning,
Mrs. Macleod.
Morning.
You're not thinking of taking your cat to Mr. Macdhui, are you?
Why not? Och, he won't bother with it.
He doesn't care for anybody's pets.
What?
He'll just say,
"can't be cured,"
And then kill it.
Get away wi' you.
It's true. He even did it to his own daughter's cat.
And Mrs. Laggan's dog.
He killed them.
I did hear about Rabbie, but he was awful old.
That cat of yours is younger than Mary's Thomasina.
You take him in there,
And he'll just get his bottle of chloroform and...
Just a minute, Harry.
Listen.
We were just telling Mrs. Macleod,
Mr. Wallis, about Mr. Macdhui.
You'd be well advised not to take your dog in there.
I'm thinkin' of rebuilding my pigsties.
You know, I've had two outbreaks of swine fever up to now.
Have you spoken to this new vet here... Uh, Macdhui?
Not yet.
Is he any good?
One of Mr. Macclennen's cows had foot-and-mouth disease,
And Mr. Macdhui had two whole herds killed.
That young Annie of mine
Took my best black shawl from my closet yesterday
And tore it into ribbons in some game.
Aye, I saw them playing at funerals,
Burying young
Mary Macdhui's cat.
Mr. Macdhui killed it.
Killed it?
Aye, the same as he did
Mrs. Laggan's dog.
He kills things.
He saved Tammas' Bruce, laddie.
Aye, because everybody was there watching.
That was showin' off.
He's an animal murderer.
You tell me he killed his daughter's cat?
He didn't like it,
So he took his gun and killed it.
His gun? Well!
Och! Isn't that awful?
Well, now, Andrew.
Glad I saw you.
I wanted a word with you about Mary.
I did what you said, asked her to come round
And choose one of your kittens,
But she'd have none of it, or me, either.
It's like speaking with a blank wall.
To a child of her age, feeling is stronger than reason.
You know that, Andrew.
Aye, and grief is usually forgotten quickly, too,
But the death of this cat, it's like an obsession with her.
Well, she's something of a loner child.
Forgive me.
She has no mother, and she needs someone to love.
She has me.
I'd do anything for her.
No child's ever been loved so much. Unselfishly?
What do you mean?
Tell me the truth, Andrew.
Were you maybe a wee bit jealous
Of that cat of hers?
The truth, now.
The animal had to be destroyed.
It would have died anyway.
You can take my word for that.
Angus, would you do me a favor? Do you think you could have a talk with her?
You might be able to reason with her.
Well, I can try.
I wish you would.
She's at home now.
You ought to be out playing in the sunshine
And not moping here indoors.
Geordie Macnab and Hughie came asking for you.
Why don't you go and look for them?
Oh, Mr. Peddie,
Mr. Andrew's not in.
I was just passing by,
Mrs. Mackenzie,
And I thought
I'd pay a call on Mary.
Would she be at home, do you think?
I'm here, Mr. Peddie.
Well, now, there you are.
You were so quiet,
I didn't see you.
It's fair warm outdoors.
You're wise to stay inside.
Would you mind if I sit down and rest a while?
Here?
Ooh, I think the stairs are a grand place
When you want to have a good think.
You know, I was thinking just now about your Thomasina.
What with my own cats,
I get all mixed up remembering what yours was like.
Thomasina, now, he was about...
She.
Oh, aye, she, yes.
Thomasina.
She was about, what...
So long?
And did she not have a wee square blaze on her chest?
No, it was round.
Round? Aye!
Now you remind me.
It was round, aye.
But she did have three little white feet, didn't she?
No white feet at all.
No? Oh.
But she had a pink nose
With two black specks on it.
I remember that well.
No specks.
No specks?
Do you remember
How she'd sit and look at you sometimes
With just the tip of her tongue showing?
When she was waiting to be fed.
Yes, when she was waiting to be fed.
You see, Mary,
Thomasina isn't dead at all,
Not really dead,
Not when we can remember her together like this,
Because she's alive in our minds. No!
And as long as you can remember her like this, she'll never die.
Just call her to your mind, and she'll come,
Even if you were to have another wee cat to love.
You know, I was saying to your daddy just this morning...
My daddy's dead.
I killed him.
Did you, Mary?
How?
I killed him.
I put him in a box with flowers in it.
We all took him out into the Glen and had a funeral,
And now I Haven't anybody at all.
Mary...
No! I like being alone!
Good day to you, Birnie.
I'm here to look at the bull.
I've let him out.
He's in the paddock.
Oh, right. I'll find him.
No need to, Mr. Macdhui.
He'll do very well.
Just tell me how much your fees are.
What's all this about?
I'll be no more needing a veterinary.
If there's anything wrong with my beasts,
I'll take them to the woman in the Glen.
She's a rare way with them and charges nothing, I'm told.
Is that where you're takin' the cow?
Aye, my man is.
What's wrong with her?
She's dried.
You have as much chance of getting pints of beer as milk
Listening to that rubbish.
I thought you were becoming enlightened, Birnie.
What I do with my beasts is no concern of yourself, Mr. Macdhui.
This cow has no disease reportable under the acts of the county.
Your bull didn't, either.
Aye, I didn't know then what sort of a vet you were -
Putting beasts to death whenever it suits you.
What?
Aye, my stockman heard it from his son at school in Inveranoch -
The dogs and cats you've no use for,
Even your own child's pet.
I see.
So you believe that,
And you're going back to the witchcraft and the superstition.
You said times change.
Well, maybe they're changing back again, Mr. Macdhui.
The old remedies are as good as book learning, sir.
Good day to you.
Apart from Mary,
I've another headache now.
The whole village seems to be boycotting me and spreading tales
About what a heartless monster I am.
Och, a few children.
It's having its effect.
In a few days, the people have forgotten
That the blind man's dog is alive because of me,
But they remember the few creatures that I had to have destroyed.
Be patient with them, Andrew. Patient?
Tell me something.
What do you know about a half-witted woman named, uh...
...Named Lori who pretends to be a witch?
Well, I rented her the croft she's living in.
I know that.
That's why I'm asking you.
And she's not half-witted, nor does she pretend to be a witch.
She's been labeled that, just as you say you've been labeled a monster,
Only she doesn't mind, because she wants to be left alone.
Well, she's not succeeding.
At least two farmers that I'd won round to scientific treatment
Are taking their beasts to her.
Aye, I hear she has a remarkable skill with animals.
What skill?
Without real knowledge, you can do great harm.
Would you take a sick child to a quack doctor?
Some people have natural gifts, Andrew,
And Lori Macgregor has the rare quality of mercy.
Since you know her so well, perhaps you'd tell her
To stop undermining the progress that
I'm trying to bring to these people here.
Why don't you tell her,
Andrew,
And tell me afterwards what you make of her.
Aye. Aye, I Will, one day,
And put a stop to her interference with my work.
Time passed,
And I began to see and feel again.
I couldn't remember any part of my first life,
Although something told me
I'd lived before,
That I was still me.
I'd heard that a cat has nine lives.
I accepted the fact, so...
This was my second life,
My life with a girl named Lori.
She was gentle and kind,
I'll give her that,
But she didn't seem to realize -
And neither did the other creatures around me
- how important I was.
There we are.
All of you -
Dorcas, Mack,
Molly,
Whisker - be nice to Thomasina now.
"be nice," she said,
But none of the others paid any attention to me at all.
They weren't really my kind anyway.
Thomasina, dear,
Go and walk in the sun now you're able.
There are others here who are not.
I wasn't important anymore,
Treated just like everybody else.
Now I knew how a king feels in exile.
Hughie, Jamie, quick!
what is it?
Come and see quick.
A badger.
He's been in the trap a long time,
And he's badly hurt.
What'll we do with him?
If we try and take the trap off, he'll only bite.
We could wrap him up in a sack, trap and all,
And take him to the village, to the vet.
To Mr. Macdhui?
We can't do that.
We're trying to get rid of him.
What else, then?
Couldn't we take the badger to the witch?
She's nearer.
Aye, that's true.
She couldn't cure a mess like that with magic.
I bet she could.
Mr. Macdhui would only kill it,
So let's wrap him up and take him to the witch.
Jamie, get the things.
I'll get the sack.
Careful now.
You've got him?
Aye, got him.
Seeing and hearing these boys gave me that
"I've been here before" feeling.
You know what I mean?
I knew them, and yet I didn't.
They made me feel uneasy somehow,
So I kept an eye on them.
Well, who's gonna take him to her, then?
You. You're the eldest, you're always telling us.
Aye, but - but it was Geordie's idea.
He's too big for Geordie to carry,
But if you're afraid...
I'm not afraid of anything.
Well, go on, then.
Put him by the tree and ring that bell.
Oh, poor thing.
Poor thing.
Oh, God, please, God, help me.
Wait!
Don't touch it.
But it's hurt, from that.
Cursed gin traps.
Look what it's done to...
Mind yourself.
Drop it. It'll tear your throat out.
It'll not harm me. No creature harms me. They're not afraid.
Put it down. You're mad. Aye, so I hear.
Get away from it.
Let me go. Let me go!
I'm sorry, but a wounded badger could half kill you.
No creature ever harms me. Don't touch him!
Leave him to me.
To you?
Why, who are you?
My name is Macdhui. I'm the veterinary from Inveranoch.
You are?
Now I see.
What do you mean?
You have the skill that I Haven't,
The skill that I prayed for when I found the badger.
Don't you see? You're meant to help him, and you must.
It's no use, I tell you.
It's too late.
Be kinder to put him out of his pain.
And wonderful to give him his life.
You have the skill for it.
Please, for pity's sake.
Don't go!
I've got to get my instruments.
They're in my car.
God, you sent him.
Please make him hurry back.
Well, that's it.
We'll have to see how it takes.
Still, they're hardy creatures with great vitality.
He has a chance.
Bless you and thank you for giving it the hance.
He'll have to stay quiet until the wounds heal.
Have you got a place where you can keep him?
Yes.
All right.
Are all these wild things in your care?
Yes, they come here to me.
Some instinct or guardian
Angel brings them.
And what kind of treatment do you give them?
Food, warmth, comfort and love.
And let nature take its course,
And that mends them.
And what about the other beasts that are brought to you?
Farmer Birnie's cow, for instance.
I know all about that.
What did you do for her?
I sent her back to him with a message for him to be kinder to her.
Ha. Like to seen his face.
And this?
I found him one morning by the tree outside in a box.
He had a broken leg, but he's better now.
Well, I can describe his guardian Angel to you.
He's about six years old, red hair, and his name is Geordie Macnab.
Well, keep your eye on the badger, Miss Macgregor,
And see that he doesn't tear off the dressing.
Aye, I'll watch him.
You know, um, in Inveranoch,
They, uh, they call you "witch,"
And if you can get all these creatures here to live together in peace,
Perhaps there's some truth in it.
The truth is that they have security
Because they've no fear.
Animals are not like people.
They only fight and kill when they're hungry or afraid,
Not for gain or to prove how strong they are.
You don't have to be a witch to understand that.
What made you come here,
Mr. Macdhui?
Well, I-I thought that, uh...
It's no matter now.
I must go.
I've work to do.
Wait. I must pay you for the work you've done.
Um, there's no need.
Will you take this, then, from me?
I made it here.
Then I'm glad to have it.
Thank you.
I knew the man...
And yet I didn't know him.
He reminded me of someone,
Something that was missing in my present life.
What do you think he's done?
Killed it.
But the witch wouldn't let him.
He wouldn't be likely to help her with magic, now, would he?
Suppose we had a look through the window.
It's our badger.
We're responsible for him.
Aye. Maybe if we were careful...
Come on, Geordie.
If she catches us,
You can say you came to see how your frog was getting on.
You want to know, don't you?
Come on, then.
Psst!
the badger's in here.
I think he's dead.
I told you Mr. Macdhui would kill him.
Here, Geordie, you're the smallest.
Climb up and have a look.
He's not dead.
I can see him breathing.
are you sure?
Look out!
ow!
Let me go!
Let me go!
Och! It's all right.
What's the matter?
What are you afraid of?
Let me go!
You're the one who brought the frog to me.
He's better now.
His leg has mended.
Do you want him back?
Then come and see him.
He's not very strong at hopping yet,
But he can swim all right.
He's going in with her.
She must have put a spell on him.
Here's your wee frog.
Look.
Oh, he's better.
Did you do it with magic?
With a powerful magic,
Geordie.
You know my name.
Cor!
Was it you who brought the wounded badger, too?
Is he going to be all right, please?
Did you do magic with him?
No, that was Mr. Macdhui.
What he did was magic.
Mr. Macdhui - does he do magic?
He has a wonderful skill that's almost magic.
He saved the badger's life.
Can I go now?
Don't you want to take your frog?
Thank you for curing my frog.
I'm not afraid anymore.
Well, not much, that is,
But I have to go now.
are you all right?
Yes. Look, she cured the frog.
But what about the badger? She cured him, too.
She put a spell on Mr. Macdhui and made him help her.
She's an awful good witch.
Hello, Mary.
Do you know what I did today?
Went up to the Glen to see your witch.
You know, she's not a witch at all.
She, uh... Isn't even what Mrs.
Mack calls, uh, "something weird. "
She's a bit like yourself -
Wants to be left alone.
Except that she's, uh,
She's got all kinds of creatures up there with her -
Squirrels and rabbits, stray dogs, cats,
Uh, wild birds
And a -
And a badger.
If I go up there again,
Would you like to come with me and see him?
Look, Mary,
I brought you a present.
look.
Something of your very own.
Och, I couldn't get nowhere with her.
She shows no signs of wearying of this game she's playing, that I'm not there.
And how do you play it,
Andrew?
Talk to her, behave as if everything was normal between us,
Read stories to her, but she pays no heed.
And that wee dog you got for her?
She'd have none of it.
I had to take it away again.
No, she won't forgive me, because I failed her.
At least, that's the way she sees it.
I think the trouble lies deeper than that.
You were the only human focus for her love.
That's why her shock of disappointment in you was so great.
Andrew, have you ever thought of getting married again?
No.
You need another focus for your love
Besides the child, and Mary needs a mother.
It's too late for me to fall in love again.
Oh... So you've seen
Lori Macgregor.
Aye, I've seen her.
What do you make of her?
Don't know.
She, uh, she has a-a strange way with her,
A strange skill that's instinctive.
I don't understand how she lives out there, cut off, alone,
And yet doesn't seem to be alone.
You should see her again, Andrew.
Maybe she could teach you that rare virtue.
You're in need of it, my friend, great need of it.
Good night, angus.
Hello, Miss Macgregor.
So he came to see Lori,
But putting a stop to what she was doing
Soon went out of his mind,
And he kept on coming to see her.
I've learned a great deal watching you.
If only I had the skill you have.
But you've a way of taking the fear out of these wild creatures,
Making them trust you, that I wish I had.
But I'm a witch, remember?
Aye, you must be.
You cast some kind of a spell on them.
I love them all.
When they're lost or strayed or alone in pain,
That's what they need.
I feel for them.
And you, with all your skill - do you?
I give them what I have, my knowledge of what to do.
I do my job.
Is that all it is to you?
You must have chosen to become a veterinary.
No, my-my father was one himself.
He chose it for me,
And he was a man that you didn't cross.
No, all my life,
I wanted to be a doctor,
Dreamed of it and worked for it.
You must have put a spell on me to make me tell you that.
Except for my wife,
I've never told another soul.
Only she knew.
"knew"?
Aye, she's dead now, about five years ago.
You say you believe in providence and in God's mercy,
And you wonder why I don't?
How can you not?
I loved my wife.
She did nothing but good.
She went out nursing the sick in an epidemic,
Caught the sickness herself, and died.
"the Will of God is inscrutable," they told me.
"God is love," they told me.
Which is true.
That's what she believed,
Yet the God who's supposed to be love allowed her to die.
And therefore you reject him?
Because your love died, his love has no truth?
Is that what you mean?
Ask yourself that when you've known pain.
I saw both my parents drown,
Andrew, in a storm at sea,
But my Faith didn't die with them,
And they wouldn't have wished it. I know that.
I'm sorry. Forgive me.
Forgive?
I'm glad you told me of yourself
And I told you.
Aye.
I'm glad, too.
I must go now.
The man's coming back gave me that feeling once again
Of there having been some other time,
Some other place...
And one night it came to a head.
It was as if something was pulling me,
Drawing me on
And on and on.
I knew the way somehow,
Although I didn't know why or where I was going.
Thomasina.
Thomasina!
Thomasina! Thomasina!
Come back!
Thomasina!
Thomasina!
Thomasina!
Thomasina!
Mary!
Mary!
Thomasina!
Thomasina.
Thomasina.
No, no!
Let me go! I saw her!
I saw her! Let me go!
You were right to call me.
She's in bad shock.
Could turn to pneumonia.
I see signs of it now.
I've done all I can for the moment.
I'll be around first thing in the morning.
Thank you, Strathsay.
What should I do?
Keep taking her temperature every hour or so.
It's just over 100 now.
If it gets any higher, let me know at once.
I won't leave her. Show the doctor out, Mrs. Mack.
You better get out of those wet things. You'll catch cold.
I heard the shouting, saw the doctor arrive.
Glad you came, angus.
I'm worried sick.
If she should catch pneumonia...
Aye, that's a great battle
For a wee bairn to fight alone.
Pray for her, Andrew.
Pray for God's help and mercy.
Pray.
Yes, pray, because if ever there was a man
In need of mercy, it is you.
You know I'm not a one for praying,
For goin' down on my knees.
Well, pray on your feet, man.
It's what's in your heart and mind that matters,
Not whether you kneel or not,
Though that would be good for your soul.
It's this stubborn pride of yours
That has made you live inside yourself so long.
I've forgotten how to pray.
I can't do it.
I can't feel the need for it.
Humble yourself, Andrew.
Humble yourself.
If you love the child,
Pray for her.
Oh, Thomasina, where have you been?
I didn't know.
From the present back into the past,
To the present again,
Where I was safe,
Protected,
And loved.
Where are you boys going?
Further up the Glen, granny. Well, you're not to.
They say in the village there's a witch up here.
She'll put the evil eye on you.
make way!
yah!
Hah! Hah!
Right, you devil.
You'll pay for this.
Come on!
What's he gonna do to the horse?
Let's go and see.
Aye.
Darvas, put the bear to his paces
And wake him up.
come on, get out.
Get out. Go on. Go!
all right, get him out.
Get him out!
Down you come.
Down!
Come on.
Now this way. Up.
Up now.
Come on, up and dance.
Come on, up! Up!
Up and dance.
Come on, you blackguard.
Get up and dance now!
This one's worse than the other.
The bear can hardly walk, let alone dance.
What are you doing under there? Get 'em!
Come on, boys, get 'em!
One gettin' away.
The other one's...
Got him down.
All right!
Let him go!
Come back here, you.
Get back to work!
Mr. Macquarrie, sir, there's some gypsies in the Glen,
And you've got to do something about them.
They're beating horses, and there's half-starved dogs
And a poor bear with a sore foot. It's true!
Now, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
One at a time. Now.
We were up there watching them.
They're beating their animals.
Oh, they're awful people, sir.
You've got to arrest them,
Mr. Macquarrie.
I've already told them to leave the district and move on.
I gave them until tomorrow while they rest their horses.
rest them? You should see what they're doing.
You bring me a complaint from the proper person, and I'll act on it.
I don't take orders from a lot of children.
What proper person?
The county officer concerned
With cruelty to beasts -
Mr. Macdhui.
Mr. Macdhui?
Uh-oh, what's this?
How's Mary, please, sir?
We're sorry that she's sick.
Aye, she's very sick.
We hope she'll get better soon.
We Haven't seen much of her sin...
Since the funeral of Thomasina.
But we really came to see you about another matter, sir.
what's that?
To report cruelty to animals.
There's some gypsies up in the Glen
With performing animals.
They're awful cruel.
They've got a bear with a sore foot,
And they make him dance!
Constable Macquarrie said that if you were to examine them
And report them to him, he could put a stop to it, sir.
But I thought that my opinion as an animal doctor
Was no good.
Somebody called Hughie Stirling has been saying so.
Would he be a friend of yours?
He's no friend of mine, sir.
Hughie Stirling's a bit of a fool, sir.
Everybody knows that.
would you do something about the circus animals?
Aye, I, uh,
I Will when I can.
Well, uh, run along now, all of you.
He won't do anything.
He wasn't even listening.
Yes, he was.
He said he'd go when he can.
He doesn't care about those animals.
Well, we can't do any more, can we?
Yes, we can. We've got to. Hey, Geordie.
We could tell the witch about it - Lori.
The witch?
Aye, why not?
You say you're not afraid of her.
You could tell her.
Me?
She'd maybe put a spell on those gypsies,
Turn that big one into a horse or a bear and learn for himself
What it's like to be badly treated.
I bet she'd do it.
Go and tell her, Geordie.
Go on. I dare you.
Why, Geordie, hello there.
I came to ask you something, please.
Will you come in, then?
It's better if I do.
I brought you a present if you'd like it.
It's because you cured my frog.
Oh, Geordie, you didn't have to do that.
How is your frog?
Och, he's fine.
This is my present.
I made it myself.
What a beautiful pipe rack.
Thank you, Geordie.
It's just what I need.
I thought you might.
I was - we were wondering
If you'd do something else with magic.
Another frog?
Och, no.
There's a gypsy circus down in the Glen
With all kinds of animals and a bear,
And the people are awful cruel to them,
Beating them and that, and they're half starved.
Have you told the police?
Aye, and Mr. Macdhui,
But they won't do anything about it.
Mr. Macdhui won't?
No, we asked him, and he said so.
We thought maybe you could put some magic
On the gypsies to stop them.
Would you, please?
The bear's got an awful sore foot.
I'll go and see what I can do, anyway, I promise you that.
I knew you would.
Oh, thank you.
I have to go now.
She's going to do it!
She's going to put a spell on the gypsies!
You cannot stay in here all day and night
Torturing yourself, man.
You've had no rest, no food.
Rest? What rest can I have?
Strathsay says she's no longer fighting.
It's as if she's lost the Will to live.
Where is Strathsay?
He said he'd be back by now.
He said the fever must run its course.
There's no crisis yet.
He's done what he can for Mary.
We're all of us praying for her.
Praying?
I humbled myself and prayed, too.
I'd crawl on my hands and knees if begging for her life would save it.
She's lost and hurt, angus.
I can make no contact with her.
I wonder...
Perhaps someone who has the gift
For hurt and lost creatures
Could unlock the child's mind.
You mean Lori Macgregor?
I do.
Then ask her.
Bring her here.
She's unlocked your mind enough to make you realize
You're not sufficient yourself.
Stay here with the child, Angus.
Lori?
Lori!
So one night the man came again...
Lori!
...But this time he looked helpless
And lost
And frightened.
music playing)
Now let's get the bear out.
We'll have him on next.
Wait a minute.
What are you doing in there?
She's the witch the women speak of.
Come on out, you!
If you're in charge here, you should be ashamed.
Your dogs are sick, these horses past work.
The bear is... You're breaking my heart.
All right, then, you dance, witch.
you do the bear's act for him.
Come on.
it's the witch.
no! Aah!
Let -
Let me go!
Let me go!
Andrew!
you dance for the bear.
Look at him!
Look at Mr. Macdhui!
Who's in charge here?
I am. King Targu.
What right have you to knock about my people?
What exactly were you doing?
Driving out the witch who set the evil eye upon us.
Evil eye? I've heard about the evil you do with these wretched beasts.
What do you want here?
I have the power to close down your show for cruelty to animals.
That's what I'm going to do.
You'll pay for this.
Get him, and the witch!
Behind your back,
Mr. Macdhui!
I'm not standing for this. Come on!
Get the boys out of here.
Keep clear of this.
ooh.
Form a water chain! Quick!
Lori, get those children out of here. Quick!
Macquarrie, take that man in charge for cruelty to animals.
Here, give a hand here!
Try to hold still.
The bleeding has stopped, but it's an awful deep cut you have there.
Lori, Will you listen to me?
I've told you I'll not till
I finish dressing this wound.
You should have gone down to
Inveranoch with the others,
To a doctor, and not come up here to me.
Stop! Listen to me, m...
I am listening, Andrew.
I'm a wee bit scared not to when you're so fierce.
I was afraid of you down there in the fightin',
And afraid for you.
I came up here looking for you,
Just like the other strays and the lost that come to you.
Why?
My daughter is sick with pneumonia,
And I need your help.
I want you to come to her with me.
To your house?
Please come.
Why me?
Well, you have a
- a kind of a magic for the hurt and the sick.
I've hurt the child so much that her sickness is the worse for it.
You have? How?
Well, she had a pet that she loved more than anything.
I had to have it destroyed.
I didn't realize how much it meant to the child,
But in-in doing what I did, I...
I betrayed her trust in me.
I killed something in her.
Lori, you prayed yourself once, didn't you?
And you said that my coming here
Could be the answer to the prayer. Aye, it was.
Well, I prayed, too, and your coming with me now could be the answer to that...
For me, for Mary.
Will you come, please?
So... He brought you.
What have you been doing, man,
To get in that state - brawling somewhere?
How is she?
The same.
What is this?
Mary?
Mary Macdhui.
Do you hear me?
Andrew, may I take her?
Do what you Will.
What does this woman think she's doing? Let her be.
Andrew, there's so little of her left.
When the man took Lori away and they left me alone,
I was frightened.
I had to be with somebody.
The feeling grew stronger
And stronger.
Suddenly, like the lightning flash that split the tree,
Everything -
My other lost life - came back to me.
I knew where I belonged.
I had to go home.
Home.
Home.
Home!
Thomasina!
Can't be.
It's my Thomasina.
Yours?
I found her sick and nursed her.
Is she hers?
Is that the pet?
Thomasina! Thomasina!
Lori, call her!
Make her come in.
No, you must.
She must come to you.
Thomasina.
Don't you see that if Thomasina
Is the love your child has lost,
Only you can give it back to her.
Call her. Make her come.
Thomasina.
Come to me.
For the love of God, come to me.
I knew him now...
Macdhui, my murderer...
And he needed me.
Without me, he was lost.
So this was my Chance,
The moment of truth for both of us.
Thomasina.
Come to me.
Yet, because of my second life with Lori...
Thomasina...
...Because of what
I'd learned from her,
I didn't want revenge.
I wanted to come home.
Mary.
Mary...
I brought Thomasina to you.
She's come back to life again.
No, it's not a ghost,
Not a dream.
It's Thomasina.
She's come back.
It's Thomasina.
She's alive again.
Aye.
She's alive again.
And you're alive again, too.
I'm alive again, too.
So, my third life began,
With all of us together.
Not now.
goodbye!
And, to coin a phrase,
We all lived happily ever after.

Help! Ohhh!
Help! Help!
Madam, madam, please be patient.
After all, this is the final examination for these dental students.
It's important that you cooperate.
Now, stay in your chair and try to relax.
Golly Ned, Mother!
Relax. Up we go.
All right.
You just sit down there.
There we go.
All righty, Miss Stevenson.
Now, first things first.
Now we're just gonna take a little look-see at your general dental condition.
Sort of get the lay of the land.
You know? Okay.
All righty, open your mouth.
No, no, you see, if, uh... if you don't open your mouth, then I can't see anything.
See? That's the way that works.
Uh, come on now, Miss Stevenson.
Seriously. Open your mouth.
Open up.
Come on, come on.
I'll help you here. I'll get that... There. Open that...
How're you doing, Heywood? Fine. Fine.
Dr. Friedlander?
What seems to be the trouble, Heywood?
Complete closure of the oral cavity, eh?
She won't open her mouth.
Watch me carefully.
Well, Miss Stevenson, don't we look lovely today.
But we have a toothache, haven't we?
A tooth saved is a silver dollar in the bank of health.
Now, open your mouth, dear.
Op... Open wide.
Are we going to open up that mouth?
Open that rotten little mouth!
You're in my way, Heywood.
You're in my way!
I can't...
I can't get loose.
Wait 'til I get...
Get me out of here!
You're on your own from here on, Heywood.
If you don't get that mouth open and get that tooth fixed, you don't graduate.
Mm-hmm.
Now, Miss Stevenson,
I realize that this is hardly the time or place to bring this up, but, uh, I'd like very much to see you socially sometime.
Oh! Well, I, uh...
There!
Everything going okay, Heywood?
Fine. Uh-huh. Fine.
Mm-hmm.
All right, make way for the mother of a dentist.
The mother ofJesse W. Heywood, valedictorian.
I'm her best friend.
Uh, Dr. Friedlander, faculty, students... and parents.
As we, uh, stand on the threshold...
Louder.! As we stand on the threshold of graduation, we may get the feeling that this is the end.
This is really the beginning...
Louder.!
This is really the beginning... of stepping out into new horizons: north, south, east... and... west.
Speaking of west, that is the direc... that is the direction that I personally am going to.
Why did I choose the West?
Because the West is a place where few, if any, dentists have trod.
So I am going to trod there.
Why, Jesse? Why?
Well, Mom, the West needs dentists.
I mean, teeth are fallin' out right and left out there.
Teeth are falling out in Philadelphia too.
Yeah, but Philadelphia is overrun with dentists. There must be seven!
Gratitude! Gratitude!
Some nice gratitude!
But all the plans, all the nice surprises.
Your Uncle George was going to give you an office over the harness shop... for $3.00 a month.
And Celia's Leonard was going to give you... four rolls of wallpaper.
Blue ducks.

Oh, Jesse!
Jesse, Jesse, Jesse!
Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom.
If he were mine, I'd know what to do. Put him across my knee.
Butt out!
I'm family!
You're not family!
I'm your aunt!
You're not a real aunt. Just my mother's best friend. Oh, yeah?
Yeah! Yeah!
Yeah?
How's it going, Heywood? Fine. Fine.
Those half-naked savages must have colds all the time.
Oh, Ma, that's an old wives' tale.
Your average Indian's the healthiest person in the world.
But, Jesse, dear, it stands to reason... Uh, Ma, Ma, Ma!
Call me "Doctor."
Oh, excuse me, is this car 24?
Uh, all the way down, mack.
Thank you.
But, Doctor, you've always been such a delicate little boy.
You've got such touchy sinuses.
You've always had your father's delicate sinuses.
Aw, Ma!
Now don't "aw" me.
It was your father's sinuses that killed him.
He was run over by a beer wagon!
He was blowing his nose in the middle of the street.
Well, I'm not going to cry.
Good for you, Ma.
I promised myself
I wouldn't cry.
Attagirl.
If you don't believe me, ask Celia.
I said, "Celia, I'm not going to cry at the station."
And you've always kept your word, Ma.
Uh, is this car 24?
Uh, back that way.
Huh. Well...
I'll bet you think
I'm crying right now.
You promised yourself you wouldn't. And I'm not!
That's 'cause you're strong, Ma.
Just think, Ma.
Gettin' ready to head west.
In two days, I'll be in Ohio.
In one week, I'll be in St. Louis.
And in two months,
California!
What an age we live in.
Things are moving too fast.
Excuse me, bunky.
Is this about it?
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Thank you. Thank you.
Well, Ma...
Oh! Oh, uh...
Ma, you got something for the porter? Got a nickel?
A nickel?
Uh, n-no charge.
Ma, what's that?
Well, it got your Uncle Metcalf safely through the Civil War.
Here, you may need it.
Well, gee, Ma, that's kind of nifty.
Wear it in good health.
Board.!
Well, Ma, I guess this is it.
Good-bye, dear.
Write me as soon as you get to the West.
I will, Ma.
Don't look back, Ma.
Goin' out west, partner?
Sure am, partner.
Naka washa.
Well... thank you, dear lady.
Oh, uh, thank you, dear lady.
Mmm!
That's good!
What is that?
Wana tonka.
Wana tonka?
Lizard roll.
Rest stop! Rest stop!
All right, everybody out of that stage. Come on!
Come on!
Come on, let's go.!
And you up there, throw down that strongbox!
Hold it, driver.!
Go ahead!
Whoa! Whoa!
What happened, Arthur?
Two men held us up out on the Willow
Creek Road. They got the strongbox.
All right.
Come on, men. Let's go.
I just love this kind of stuff. Oh, come on!
Fred, got a passenger for ya on the through stage.
Be sure he gets on it.
Hot digs!
Come to 2,200 apiece.
You know something, Penny?
This is the first time...
I ever had this much money at one time in my whole life.
There's plenty more where that came from, Pop.
I got two stagecoaches lined up next week. A hundred miles apart.
Hold it, Penny. Count me out. What?
That's right. This was my last job.
After 30 years of rustling cattle and holding up banks, I'm packing it in.
This'll be easy pickin's, Pop.
No. I'm gonna take this here money... and fulfill my lifelong ambition.
What's that, Pop?
Go to Boston and open up a little dress shop.
A dress shop?
Well, wait a minute, Penny.
Just 'cause I'm rough and dirty and don't wear underwear, don't mean that I ain't artistic.
All the years we've been together,
I never heard you mention that once.
Well, I reckon it would sound kind of funny in front of the other gentlemen.
Well, if that's the way you want it.
At least we can ride together as far as Hole in the Wall.
A dress shop?
Hold it, Penny!
What is it?
Sounds like maybe 10 or 15 horses.
Nice posse size.
Let's get outta here.
Whoa! Whoa! Penny, there ain't but one thing to do.
They're gainin' on us.
We gotta split up.
You follow that stream there.
I'll head north and try to draw 'em off. Good luck, honey.
Don't get caught, Pop.
Remember your dress shop.
Yeah, it looks like one of'em.
I just love this kind of stuff.
Let's go.
I just hate this kind of stuff! Grab her, Floyd!
Where?
Where?
I don't know about grabbin' women! I ain't married!
Where's that federal marshal? He's on his way over.
You've got no right!
You've got no right holding a defenseless woman prisoner!
Now simmer down!
You just simmer down, Penny.
Marshal Bates here wants to talk to you.
Miss Cushings,
I've got a proposition for you.
Not interested!
Better hear me out.
This paper's a full pardon.
You dang fool! The marshal wants you to work for the federal government.
It's a trick!
I just love this kind of stuff!
No, it's no trick.
Now listen to me carefully.
Somebody's been smuggling guns to some renegade Comanche Indians.
What's that got to do with me?
We need your help to find out who it is.
The marshal wants you to work as an undercover agent.
We've already lost two men.
We figure they won't be suspicious of a woman posin' as a homesteader.
Well, what do you think, Penny?
I don't know.
We got enough on you to send you away for 300 years.
Ya ninny! He wants to give you a pardon!
Here, read this.
Is it a real pardon?
It's got the governor's signature on it.
You got yourself a deal.
Hey, this is pretty excitin'.
You mind if
I tell everybody?
You do and I'll shoot you... right in the mouth.
Excuse me, sir.
Could you tell me where I could buy a wagon and a good team of horses?
Yep. Right across the street there.
Abel Swanson will sell you anything you want.
But watch him.
He's real slick.
He'll cheat you if he gets a chance.
Yeah? Well, he'll have to get up pretty early in the morning... to pull the wool overJesse W. Heywood's eyes.
Much obliged.
Love your hat!
Mr. Swanson?
Oh. Howdy.
I'd like to see Mr. Swanson about gettin' a good rig and a team.
Well, I don't know anything about that.
And you can tell him that just because I'm from out of town,
that don't mean I don't know what it's all about.!
Good day, sir. Abel Swanson, proprietor, at your service.
Dr. Jesse W. Heywood, dentist, Philadelphia.
Ah, a professional man! What a pleasure to do business with a man of science!
Wong, our house is honored by the presence of a physician.
Wong reveres knowledge.
We are at your service.
Uh, well...
I want to get a rig and a couple of good strong horses.
And I'll pay nothin' but a fair price.
It's a pleasure to do business with a discerning man.
Now, everything you need is right over here.
There's a potbellied stove, wrought iron skillet, twenty pounds of flour, one axe, two extra handles.
Now, let's see. A stove, $7.50; skillet,
$4.20; flour, $8.50; $9.75 for an axe.
Add that up, will you, Wong?
That comes to $47, even.
Now for the wagon...
Wait a minute.
Hold it. Hold it!
Forty-seven dollars?
The stove was $7.50.
The skillet was $4.20.
That's $11.70. Then you have...
Have you ever been in the Orient, sir? Huh?
Have you ever been in the Orient?
No, I never have.
That's amazing.
Simply amazing.
Wong, observe the analytical mind of the trained scientist.
Skilled in the arts of mathematics, physics, chemistry.
Able to understand the machinations of the Oriental calculating abacus.
Run over those figures for him again, Wong.
Yeah. That's $47, all right.
Extraordinary mind.
You, sir, are amazing.
Now, let's put you into a wagon.
Right this way.
Okay.
You are indeed a fortunate man!
This is your lucky day!
The wagon you are beholding... soon to be yours... is the only one of its kind west of the Mississippi.
How much is it?
Built of the finest oak.
Once owned by one of the great pioneers of our west, the late Sir Lincoln Boone.
I know this is no time to bring this up, but how much is it?
Excuse me. I'll let it go for a hundred dollars.
How much? One hundred and fifty dollars.
Now that seems kind of expensive to me!
Expensive? Too expensive for a vehicle worthy of transporting... one of the great scientific minds of our day?
Sir, this wagon befits you.
Wong, let us not forget. Our house is honored by the presence of a physician.
Uh, well... Now wait a...
That's enough. I, uh...
Now listen, I think 150 will be okay. Sold!
Wong, add that up.
Forty-seven and 150.
That comes to $232.55.
That is correct.
Well, figures don't lie.
That's an even $250 with the territory tax.
And that'll be cash, of course.
Territory tax?
Gracias. It was a pleasure doing business with you, sir. Chop-chop!
Uh, I'll see you.
Oh, wait a minute!
I-I almost forgot.
Well, what about the horses?
Why, surely you jest. There hasn't been a horse for sale in over three weeks.
Wait a second!
If you didn't have any horses for sale, how come you sold me that wagon and all that stuff?
We just like to keep busy.
You have no right to...
What time do you have, sir?
Huh? Oh, 5:30.
We're closed. Well...
Now just wait a minute!
Hold it! Hold it!
Hold it! Why, you...
How am I gonna get out west if I don't have any horses?
You... You cheaters! Cheaters!
Abacus cadabacus!
Mr. Huggins?
That's right.
Penelope Cushings.
Won't you come in?
What can I do for you,
Miss Cushings?
First, I must warn you, I'm not taking on any new clients.
I expect to be leaving town shortly.
The moon is on the wane.
You?
You were looking for a woman, weren't you?
Well, yes, but you're...
Well, not like you.
Expecting someone a bit more horsey?
Sort of.
Well, I'm what they came up with, so let's get down to business.
We're to take the wagon train to San
Miguel with you posing as my wife.
Oh?
Strictly federal business.
Once there, we get in touch with Will Banks.
You've got a rig?
Waiting out in the staging area.
Any notion as to how the rifles are getting to the Indians?
Nope. There could even be some on the wagon train we're taking.
Well, now, do you have everything you need? Yes, I think so.
Good. We'll leave day after tomorrow at sunup.
Strictly federal business?
Strictly.
Done and done.
That's Sam Huggins, the lawyer.
Who did it? Shots came from across the street. This fellow staggered in.
- Did anybody call a doctor?
- Doc Gifford's out of town.
Wait a minute. There's a doctor right here in the hotel.
Dr. Jesse W. Heywood.
Room three.
Come on, Lyle!
Ernie, come on!
Hurry it up!
He don't answer.
Darn you, Lyle!
Dr. Heywood!
Dr. Heywood!
Wake up! Wake up!
Let's go up there.!
We're coming! Dr. Heywood,
Dr. Heywood! Please, wake up!
Doctor, we have an emergency in the lobby.
Hmm. Emergency.
Hmm? Yeah.
I'm awake. I'm awake.
All right, everybody.
Stand back. Give this man air.
He's probably got a badly impacted wisdom tooth.
You fool!
Here's the trouble.
Hey, you sure handled that nice last night, Doc.
Uh... morning!
Uh, look, I hope I didn't give the hotel a bad name by fainting.
I mean, I feel bad about that.
Makes me feel terrible.
Your shoe's untied.
Oh, yeah. Thank you.
Well, I'll just, uh...
I'll, uh, tie it over here.
Oh, uh... uh, ma'am?
Ma'am? Wa...
Wait just...
Just... wa...
Uh, ma'am!
Oh, ma'am!
Uh, ma'am.
Excuse me, ma'am.
I just wanted to express my deepest sympathy... and to apologize for, uh... well, what happened to me there last night.
See, actually I'm a dentist.
See, I'm not a doctor.
And, well, when I see something like that,
I just sort of go all fuzzy.
What's a tender ninny like you doing out here in the first place?
Uh, ma'am, uh...
Now I realize that that may have come about as a result of your grief.
But I don't like to be called a tender ninny.
Tender ninny!
Okay. All right.
Now, all right.
I'm gonna tell you something.
I'm in teeth!
And I came out here all the way from Philadelphia single-handed to fight oral ignorance!
And I intend to go further west!
West is that way.
West! And I'm gonna find me a couple of horses, and I'm leaving on the next wagon train out!
Now what do you think about that?
Um, are you going to take your tree and your dog along with you?
I'm sorry about your husband passin'on, ma'am, but rules are rules and I gotta stick to 'em.
No women alone on the wagon train.
Uh, look, Mr. Welsh, I have got to get on this wagon train.
No single women.
Company rules.
Well, I've got to find some way.
The only thing I can recommend is you find yourself a husband by 5:00 tomorrow mornin'.
A husband?
Mm-hmm.
All you need is somethin' wearin' pants goin' that way.
Uh, west is that... way.
Oh!
Hello, Dentist.
Hello!
Uh... it's you!
Aren't you going to ask me to come in?
Huh? Oh... Oh, sure!
Yeah! Come in, come in.
Oh, uh...
I like to keep my hand in.
I'm sorry to bother you like this, but I have a terrible toothache.
Is it in your mouth?
Oh, yeah.
It would be, wouldn't it?
Sure. Well, you just sit right down there, and we'll just take care of it.
I probably should have made an appointment.
I realize how busy you must be.
Oh, golly, heck!
There's always... always room for an emerg... emergency.
Uh...
I'll just, uh...
Wait a min... Uh, well...
I'll tell you what. Could you just, uh... open your mouth?
Uh... l... I need my mirror.
Oh.
That's okay.
I'll get, uh... get something else here.
Oh, do you know something?
Hmm?
When you turned away,
I noticed your profile.
It's really very attractive.
My profile?
Well...
Huh?
Oh, your hands!
Oh, they're lovely!
The hands of a surgeon.
Yeah, well, my ha...
Well, uh... hands have always run in my family.
Do you know what I think?
Uh-uh.
I think you're very nice.
Do you know what I think?
What?
I think I might faint.
Ohhh.
How did a wonderful professional man like you... escape marriage all these years?
Well, uh, I've always felt I was a little too thin for marriage.
Ohhh.
And besides, m-my main mission in life right now i-i-is to go west.
How strange fate is!
I, too, am alone and going west.
And suddenly, out of the blue sky,
I meet you.
A big... tall... handsome... man!
Now, wait a minute!
J-Just wait a minute!
I-I don't even know you.
I'm crazy about you.
Isn't that enough?
Now then, the witnesses there, Mrs.
Longbaugh and Slosh White, are 25 cents each, payable immediately following the ceremony.
Fine. Speed it up.
The wagon train leaves in an hour.
This is so sudden,
Miss Cushings.
I mean, you just don't fix a tooth one minute and get married the next.
The song is 50 cents extra.
Would you like the song?
Yes. Fine, fine.
Oh, promise me that someday...
Let's go, Reverend!
During the music?
Yes!
Well, all right.
Dearly beloved, we are gathered here...
Now wait a minute!
Hold it!
I can't get married without telling my mother.
There isn't any time. We've got to catch the wagon train, uh, uh, uh...
Jesse.
Jesse.
My mother will just never forgive me for this.
We are assembled here in the presence of God to join together this man...
Now wa... We're strangers.
You know that, don't you?
I'd at least like you to meet my mother.
Speed it up, Reverend.
He has instructed those who have entered into this relationship, etc.
That's not Episcopalian!
By the authority invested in me by the Church,
I declare that you, Penelope, and, uh, you, uh...
Jesse.
And you, Jesse, are hereby man and wife.
Attaboy, Reverend!
Now, just hold it!
I don't feel at all that this is actually... I mean, the whole... the thing...
Mm-hmm.
We'd better hurry if we want to catch that wagon train.
Well, well, well. You did it, ma'am. What's the new name?
Dr. and Mrs. Jesse W.
Heywood. You ready to go?
Wagons west!
That's the ticket. Just pull up behind that last wagon.
Right.
Nice going.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm just so darned excited.
Mr. and Mrs. Hiram Remington. Atlanta.
Dr. and Mrs. Jesse W.
Heywood. Philadelphia.
Dr. and Mrs. Jesse W.
Heywood. Philadelphia.
Reverend Zachary Gant and my loyal minion, Matthew Basch!
Nice couple.
Fix this crate. What are you trying to do, get us thrown in jail?
Aww, a "purty" little thing like that and a derby dude, they ain't likely to be federal men.
We can't trust anybody.
Now remember that!
Come on, fix it!
Where's Willie?
Beats me.
Willie! Willie!
Here, Ma.
I told you to do that before we left!
Oh, boy!
Keep your eye on the road.
I just can't believe it.
Tonight's our wedding night.
In a few hours, we'll stop... make camp... have a little supper... then beddy-bye.
I was in the same boat as you 35 years ago.
Is that right?
I'll never forget my wedding night as long as I live.
I'll bet.
I cried like a baby.
Willie.!
Almost done, Ma.
Penelope?
Penelope?
What do you want?
Are you beddy-bye?
I suppose so.
Guard duty, Dr. Heywood.
You're kidding!
A coyote.
Hoot owl.
Aaah!
Scare ya?
Heck no! You kiddin'?
I come to relieve you, Doc. I reckon you got some chores you want to fulfill, huh?
Mm-hmm. Yeah.
Thanks. Good luck.
I'm back.
You're soft.
Come on, you little dickins!
I'll find you!
Come on now! Come on now!
Wh-Where ar... are you?
Penny!
What are you doing?
That you, Willie?
What are you doing wandering around? Shut up!
What's going on here?
I couldn't sleep, so I decided to take a walk.
That's all.
Well, you'd be lonesome, too, if your husband were on guard duty.
It's our wedding night.
Lovers' quarrel, that's all.
All right, back to bed.
Gosh, honey, I didn't realize you missed me so much.
I wonder what she's up to.
Don't you get it, Zack?
She's got the sweets on me.
I have the same trouble every place I go.
Women just come runnin' after me, wantin' to kiss me on the mouth.
Everybody up.! Everybody up.!
Indians! Indians!
Hyah!
What'll we do?
Take cover and start using that six-gun!
They're Winchesters.
The Heywood wagon.
It ain't with us.
Remington! Tyler!
Some of you men, let's go!
Get back here, you idiot.!
Bang.
Are you all right?
Uh-huh. Yeah. Fine.
Uh, I didn't know you could shoot like that.
Huh, I didn't know it myself!
Who'd have believed it?
That Doc's a gutty little cuss.
Which one's Doc Heywood?
Right there.
There he is! Hey! Doc!
The greatest!
Attaboy, Doc!
To Doc Heywood,
Indian fighter!
Say, Doc, tell us just how you killed all them Indians.
Give him a chance to clear the dust out ofhis throat.
Come on, Doc.
Drink up.!
Oh. Well.
Hmm.
It doesn't pay to drink too fast when you're thirsty.
That was good, though.
Was good.
Say, Doc, now we hear tell that you fell far behind the main wagon train.
How did that happen?
Well, I'll tell you.
That was on purpose.
There was a reason for that.
You see, it was all part of the plan.
It was all part of the plan!
As I said, it was all part of the plan.
See, I'd been spotting their signs for quite a while.
He was a-spottin' their signs!
One, maybe two months.
And then a plan began a-formulatin' in my mind.
Then a plan began a-formulatin' in his mind!
I figured I'd lay back a ways and draw 'em off the main body.
That was to give the wagon train a chance to get away.
Chance to get away! You wanna let me tell this, fella?
See, there's one thing you gotta keep in mind about Indians.
Them Indians is ten times as scared as you are...
Didn't mean to scare
Indian fighter.
You character. One of ours.
I wonder.
What?
If that skinny little Philadelphia jasper could be a federal agent.
He sure looks like a dentist to me.
How would you know?
You ain't never seen a dentist in your life.
No need to poke fun at my only weak point.
I don't know what you're talking about, lady.
I'm a roofer.
Been a roofer all my life.
Don't know nothing about the federal government.
Sam Huggins would be talking to you now, but they shot him.
Get in the wagon.
I knew it!
That whole dentist outfit was a dodge.
Look at those clothes.
He's a gunny for sure.
Yep, Matthew. That's our man.
We've gotta get rid of him.
How you gonna do it?
Simple. I'll have you pick a fight with him. Gun him down in the street.
Now, wait a minute, Reverend.
I ain't gonna tangle with him.
What's the matter?
'Fraid he'll kill you?
That's part of it. The main thing is if he nicks me, why, the scar will just ruin my looks.
I'll get a professional.
I hear that Arnold the Kid's in town.
Good!
Heck, you're always better off with a specialist, anyway.
Yeah?
Well, I'll sure know where to look if I ever need a coward.
Yep.
Arnold, kill Heywood,
I'll give you $600.
All right.
I'll give you $850.
All right.
I'll give you $ 1,000.
They told me this outfit was an original.
Get out of my way.
What?
You heard me.
Get out of my way!
Well, now. Just who do you think you are?
Arnold the Kid.
Doc the Heywood.
That name don't scare you?
It scares me this much.
All right, Mr. Kid.
Now you've gone just a little bit too far.
You're really asking for it.
Make your play!
I'll make my play.
I'll make my play.
Ippity-doo, kanaba dip, double dare, knock off the chip!
Now, what's this all about?
You wanna know what that's all about?
I'll tell you what that's all about.
You knock off that chip and you'll see what it's all about.
Uh-huh. Okay.
All right.
Okay. I'm gonna tell you something right now.
You just happen to know what I did?
Do you happen to know what I did?
Well, I'll tell you what I did!
I killed twelve Indians and two horses in one fight.
Now, how do you like those bananas?
Pass the word to clear the street.
I'll meet you here in half an hour.
Wear your gun.
Hey, I think you might have something with that Minister Gant.
They checked on him back East, and he ain't no Pentecostal.
And he sure ain't no Mormon.
They couldn't find one persuasion that ever heard tell ofhim.
Those Bible boxes were sure long and heavy.
Hey, maybe you and your husband could scout around the church.
See what's in them boxes.
Forget my husband.
He's just some Philadelphia jay
I got tied up with to get me out here.
The sooner I get rid of him, the better.
Appears to me like he could be of some help.
I hear he's pretty good with a six-gun.
What's going on?
That's Heywood out there practicing.
I heard two shots.
That means, uh, he's got four to go.
That's six. Call him out.
Heywood!
Did you want me for something?
It's been exactly a half hour.
Mm-hmm.
Heywood, I'm even gonna let you draw first.
Thank you.
Oooh! Aah!
A seven-shooter?
Hey! Great! Attaboy!
What'd you do that for?
I thought you wanted to get rid of that jay.
I don't know.
Something just come over me.
Great work, Doc.
You showed them.
Atta way, Doc.
Boy, you sure are something.
Excuse me.
Excuse me, fellas. Excuse me.
Uh, Penny!
Penny!
Did you hear about it?
I heard.
'Bout the only thing that saved me was the old killer instinct.
Uh-huh.
What about supper? I've got something to do. I'll see you later.
But I ain't seen you all day. Doc
Heywood! The sheriff wants you!
Who? The sheriff wants to see you.
Just a minute, son. Penny, look... He says it's important!
Well, all right. Where are you gonna be later? I'll be around.
Yeah.
Darn women. So excitable.
Whenever you're ready, Leonard.
Hold it like that now.
That's dandy.
Thank you.
There. That'll be a real nice picture for us.
The man who got Arnold the Kid. Well.
I guess we don't need this anymore.
Oh, say. Can I have that? I'd kind of like to keep it for a souvenir.
Sure, Doc.
Help yourself.
Leonard, get that picture developed as soon as you can.
Here, you want me to give you a hand with this?
Yes, please.
There we are.
Oh. Excuse me.
Uh, have you seen this "ladiola"?
Ah, sí, si.!
Senora dentista. Aqui.
The church?
Aqui.
Gracias, senor.
Penny!
Hold it!
What's the matter?
Thought I heard something.
Penny!
Oooh! Aah!
Penny!
Shut up.!
Penny!
Keep it quiet!
I've been looking all over town for you.
What do you want?
Is that you?
Yes, that's me.
I'll explain one of these days, but not right now.
I can't believe this!
I just can't...
You mean you're a thief? A cattle rustler? What's this all about?
I'll explain it later. Right now
I'm on government business.
Like what? Like stealing rifles from a nice church?
Shhh!
It's her. She's the agent. Let's get her.
No. Not now. Let's wait till
Doc Heywood ain't here.
Come on. Out.
It's really none of your business.
Now, let's get out of here.
Government business? What kind of government business? Hold your voice down!
But I don't get it.
One minute you're a bank robber, the next minute you're working for the government.
All right. It's true.
I am Bad Penny Cushings.
But the government said they'd clean up my record if I did this job for them.
What job?
I can't tell you any more.
Now, look. I don't know if you realize it, but our marriage is getting pretty shaky.
Now, I want to know what's going on.
All right.
Now, can I count on you to keep this quiet? Of course!
Hold your voice down.
Of course.
The government promised me amnesty... if I found out who's smuggling rifles to the Indians.
It's Gant and Basch!
Gant and Basch?
The minister and his loyal minion?
He's no minister.
And he's no minion.
I don't know, Penny.
Everything's just moving too fast.
First you came to me with a toothache; we got married; we got on the wagon train; bang, bang, bang; hurray, hurray.
Then I found out you're a crook. Then you're not a crook, you're working with the government.
Everything's just moving too fast.
Poor little dude.
You're tired, aren't you?
Mm-hmm.
Well, I think the best thing to do is to go to bed.
Huh?
I said I think the best thing to do is to go to bed.
Are you changing?
Uh-huh.
I'll just change in the closet.
You can't sleep like that!
Those spurs'll kill me!
I've got to get to Fort Tyler to get the military.
But you said...
I mean, I thought that we...
Fort Tyler?
Don't you understand? If the Indians get those rifles, they'll wipe out this town.
Oh. Yeah.
Yeah, well, I better come with you.
I'm pretty handy with a gun, you know.
I'm afraid not, dentist. You couldn't hit a bleeding elephant in the snow.
Are you kiddin'?
Twelve Indians, two horses and Arnold the Kid.
Look, you might as well know.
I shot the Indians from inside the wagon.
And Arnold the Kid from the window.
What?
You mean, I didn't...
I mean, none of those...
Nobody?
Nobody.
I'm sorry to have to tell you that, dentist.
But I wouldn't want you to come with me.
You might get hurt.
Are you coming back?
I'm afraid not.
But...
But you're my wife.
That was just to get on the wagon train.
I'm sorry.
Vaya con Dios, amigo.
Gracias.
There he is! Hey!
Attaboy!
All the way down!
Hold it, please.
Just a minute.
Uh, there's something that l...
I have to tell you.
Come on, Doc.
Speak up.
No. No more.
Now, I don't want you to think that I'm not grateful for the drinks, and for your all being so nice and everything.
But, uh, well, I'm just gonna tell you straight out.
Doc the Heywood, the well-known Indian fighter, is a fake.
It's true! It is absolutely true!
Just as long as I'm standing here, right here, right now. It's the truth.
Well, Doc, somebody killed them dozen Indians.
Now, who killed 'em?
My wife.
Just a second.!
Just a second.
Hold 'er up.
You got the Kid because we all seen it. Right!
You got him... zang! With one shot while you was a-fallin' down!
That's right!
Clean shot!
My wife got him from a window.
I wasted all my shots like a darned dumbbell! Don't you remember?
I shot two at the can, two at the sign, one at the skillet... and one in the pants.
All right now!
Hold it! Hold it!
I was watchin' the whole thing.
Now, let's see. There was, uh, there was two at the can, two at the sign, one at the skillet... and one in the pants.
Two in the can, two at the sign, one at the skillet... and one in the pants.
Oh! Oh!
Help! Aaah!
Failure, failure, failure. failure, failure, failure, failure.
That's the story of my life, you know.
Two things have always been my downfall.
I have always been... the most failure of anybody, and I'm too thin.
I don't think you're too thin.
It's all bloat.
Bloated thin failure!
That's me!
I think you're wonderful.
I just love a man that can't make his... mark in life.
Penny, hmm. Penny, she's really somethin', you know that?
Mmm-mm.
Mmm.
And she used me.
And she... she tricked me.
She made me think... that she loved me.
Aww.
I should've known better.
Nobody ever loved me.
Did you know I had to take my own cousin to the graduation dance?
Awww.
I threw up on her dress.
You are really my kind of guy.
I got on a romance track.
Then I got on a gunslinger's track.
I gotta get back on that dentist's track.
Go ahead. Laugh!
Laugh all you like.
I'm not a failure.
I'm a dentist!
A real dentist.
And I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna spread dental health through the West like a plague!
Come on. I wanna close up.
Good night, Doc.
Brush your dentist twice a day.
Visit your toothbrush once a year.
Hyah!
Penny.!
Penny!
Penny! Pen...
Water.
Uh!
Water. Water.
I gotta have water. l...
Water. I gotta have water.
Uh! Air! I gotta have air!
Air!
Penny! Penny!
Watay. Watay.!
Watay.
Watay. Watay.
Watay.
How many did we give out?
That tallies 181.
That girl. I think I know her.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Isn't that
Laughing Deer's daughter?
No. The Deer girl married White Antelope.
Rotten Buffalo's cousin? Ohhh!
Ah wan no.
Ah wan no.
Watay.
Watay?
Ah. Ah. Watay?
Watay?
Uh-huh watay.!
Dentist, you're crazy!
Are you all right?
Except for these bindings.
They're killing my hands.
I figure the best time to get out is after they all get a little drunker.
You know something?
You're a lot spunkier than I thought you were.
I get that from my mother.
Sat tey wahn ney.!
He's crazy about me.
Sat tey wahn ney.!
Looks like we're going dancing.
Here. We're gonna need this when we make our break.
Be careful.
Put me down!
Reverend.
Minion.
Well, now.
If it ain't Doc Heywood, gunfighter.
Phony gunfighter.
Say, Doc. How 'bout us havin' a real gunfight, huh?
And to make it even, it'll be just you against me and the good Reverend here.
Now, uh, what do you think about that?
You wanna know what I think about that?
Well, I'll just show you what I think about that.
Well.
Put it on, Heywood.
Anytime you're ready,
Heywood.
We've got horses right back there, Penny. Let's go.
Let me go!
Jesse's out there.
Oh, Jesse!
Let's go.
Watay?
Rider coming in!
Get ready.
They're comin'!
Get the women and the kids back into the church. Get back in the church!
Well, they're sure takin' their sweet time about it.
Devils!
Hold it.
What the...
Doc Heywood's with 'em.
He sure is.
Open up, boys.
Everything's under control.
Jesse! You're alive!
Yeah! I know.
Take my friend Black Eagle and fix him up with a big rare steak!
Adjustments are free up to 60 days.
After that, it's a dollar a visit.
I'm so glad you're back.
Me too!
Oh, come on, now.
Come... Come on!
Wait a minute! Wait...
I think there must be something wrong with me, Linus.
Christmas is coming, but I'm not happy.
I don't feel the way I'm supposed to feel.
I just don't understand Christmas,
I guess.
I like getting presents and sending Christmas cards...
...and decorating trees and all that, but I'm still not happy.
I always end up feeling depressed.
Charlie Brown, you're the only person I know...
...who can take a wonderful season like Christmas and turn it into a problem.
Maybe Lucy's right.
Of all the Charlie Browns in the world, you're the Charlie Browniest.
Hello in there.
Rats.
Nobody sent me a Christmas card today.
I almost wish there weren't a holiday season.
I know nobody likes me.
Why do we have to have a holiday season to emphasize it?
Thanks for the Christmas card you sent me, Violet.
I didn't send you a Christmas card,
Charlie Brown.
Don't you know sarcasm when you hear it?
Pigpen, you're the only person I know...
...who can raise a cloud of dust in a snowstorm.
Try to catch snowflakes on your tongue.
It's fun.
Mm. Needs sugar.
It's too early.
I never eat December snowflakes.
I always wait until January.
They sure look ripe to me.
You think you're so smart with that blanket.
What are you gonna do with it when you grow up?
Maybe I'll make it into a sport coat.
I think you have a customer.
May I help you?
- I'm in sad shape.
- Wait a minute.
Before you begin,
I must ask that you pay in advance.
Five cents, please.
Boy, what a sound.
How I love to hear that old money plink, that beautiful sound of cold, hard cash.
That beautiful, beautiful sound.
Nickels, nickels, nickels.
That beautiful sound of plinking nickels.
All right, now, what seems to be your trouble?
I feel depressed.
I know I should be happy, but I'm not.
Well, as they say on TV...
...the mere fact that you realize you need help...
...indicates that you are not too far gone.
I think we'd better pinpoint your fears.
If we can find out what you're afraid of, we can label it.
Are you afraid of responsibility?
If you are, then you have hypengyophobia.
- I don't think that's quite it.
- How about cats?
If you're afraid of cats, you have ailurophasia.
Well, sort of, but I'm not sure.
Are you afraid of staircases?
If you are, then you have climacophobia.
Maybe you have thalassophobia.
This is fear of the ocean.
Or gephyrophobia, which is the fear of crossing bridges.
Or maybe you have pantophobia.
Do you think you have pantophobia?
- What's pantophobia?
- The fear of everything.
That's it!
Actually, Lucy, my trouble is Christmas.
I just don't understand it.
Instead of feeling happy,
I feel sort of let down.
You need involvement.
You need to get involved in some real Christmas project.
How would you like to be the director of our Christmas play?
Me? You want me to be the director of the Christmas play?
Sure, Charlie Brown.
We need a director, you need involvement.
We've got a shepherd, musicians, animals, everyone you need.
We've even got a Christmas queen.
I don't know anything about directing a Christmas play.
Don't worry, I'll be there to help you.
I'll meet you at the auditorium.
Incidentally, I know how you feel about all this Christmas business...
...getting depressed and all that.
It happens to me every year.
I never get what I really want.
I always get a lot of stupid toys or a bicycle...
...or clothes or something like that.
- What is it you want?
- Real estate.
What's going on here?
What's this?
"Find the true meaning of Christmas.
Win money, money, money.
Spectacular, super-colossal neighborhood
Christmas-lights-and-display contest. "
Lights-and-display contest? Oh, no.
My own dog gone commercial.
I can't stand it. Oh...
I've been looking for you, big brother.
Will you please write a letter to Santa Claus for me?
Well, I don't have much time.
I'm supposed to get down to the school auditorium and direct a Christmas play.
You write it, and I'll tell you what I want to say.
Okay, shoot.
Dear Santa Claus, how have you been?
Did you have a nice summer?
How is your wife?
I have been extra good this year...
...so I have a long list of presents that I want.
Oh, brother.
Please note the size and color of each item and send as many as possible.
If it seems too complicated, make it easy on yourself:
Just send money.
- How about 10s and 20s?
- Tens and 20s? Oh...
Even my baby sister.
All I want is what I have coming to me.
All I want is my fair share.
All right, quiet, everybody.
Our director will be here any minute and we'll start rehearsal.
- Director? What director?
- Charlie Brown.
- Oh, no, we're doomed.
- This will be the worst Christmas play ever.
Here he comes.
Attention, everyone, here's our director.
Booooooo.
Man's best friend.
Well, it's real good seeing y'all here.
As you know, we are going to put on the Christmas play.
Due to the shortage of time, we'll get right down to work.
One of the first things to insure a good performance...
...is strict attention to the director.
I'll keep my directions simple.
If I point to the right, it means focus attention stage right.
If I make a slashing motion across my throat...
...it means cut the scene short.
If I make a revolving motion with my hand, it means pick up the tempo.
If I spread my hands apart, it means slow down.
It's the spirit of the actors that counts, the interest that they show in their director.
Am I right? I said, am I right?
Stop the music! All right, now.
We're going to do this play and we're going to do it right.
Lucy, get those costumes and scripts and pass them out.
Now, the script girl will be handing out your parts.
You're the innkeeper's wife.
Do innkeepers' wives have naturally curly hair?
Pigpen, you're the innkeeper.
In spite of my outward appearance,
I shall try to run a neat inn.
Shermy, you're a shepherd.
Every Christmas it's the same.
I always end up playing a shepherd.
Snoopy, you'll have to be all the animals in our play.
- Can you be a sheep?
- Baa.
- How about a cow?
- Moo.
How about a penguin?
- Yes, he's even a good penguin.
- Ooow!
No, no, no.
Listen, all of you.
You've got to take direction.
You've got to have discipline.
You've gotta have respect for your director.
I ought to slug you.
Ugh. I've been kissed by a dog.
I have dog germs.
Get hot water, get some disinfectant, get some iodine.
- Waaah.
- Ah.
All right, all right, script girl, continue with the scripts.
Linus, you've got to get rid of that stupid blanket.
And here, memorize these lines.
I can't memorize these lines.
This is ridiculous.
Memorize it and be ready to recite when your cue comes.
I can't memorize something like this so quickly.
Why should I be put through such agony?
Give me one good reason why I should memorize this.
I'll give you five good reasons:
One, two, three, four, five.
Those are good reasons.
Christmas is not only getting too commercial...
...it's getting too dangerous.
And get rid of that stupid blanket.
What's a Christmas shepherd gonna look like...
...holding a stupid blanket like that?
Well, this is one Christmas shepherd...
...who's going to keep his trusty blanket with him.
See? You wouldn't hit an innocent shepherd, would you?
Okay, Mr. Director, the cast is set.
Take over.
All right, let's have it quiet.
Places, everybody.
Schroeder, set the mood for first scene.
Cut, cut. No, no, no.
Look, let's rehearse the scene at the inn.
- Frieda, this is...
- We can't go on. There's too much dust.
It's taking the curl out of my naturally curly hair.
Don't think of it as dust.
Think of it as maybe the soil of some great past civilization.
Maybe the soil of ancient Babylon.
It staggers the imagination.
He may be carrying soil that was trod upon by Solomon.
Or even Nebuchadnezzar.
It sort of makes you wanna treat me with more respect, doesn't it?
You're an absolute mess.
Just look at yourself.
On the contrary,
I didn't think I'd look that good.
Sally, come here.
- What do you want her for?
- She's gonna be your wife.
Good grief.
Isn't he the cutest thing?
He has the nicest sense of humor.
- Lunch break, lunch break.
- Lunch break?
All right, now, there's no time for foolishness.
We've got to get on with our play.
That's right. What about my part?
What about the Christmas queen, hmm?
Are you going to let all this beauty go to waste?
You do think I'm beautiful, don't you,
Charlie Brown?
You didn't answer me right away.
You had to think about it first, didn't you?
If you really had thought I was beautiful, you would've spoken right up.
I know when I've been insulted.
I know when I've been insulted.
Good grief.
All right, let's take it from the top again.
Places. Action.
Charlie Brown, isn't it a great play?
That does it.
Now, look, if we're ever to get this play off the ground...
...we've gotta have some cooperation.
What's the matter, Charlie Brown?
Don't you think it's great?
- It's all wrong.
- Look, Charlie, let's face it.
We all know that Christmas is a big commercial racket.
It's run by a big Eastern syndicate, you know.
Well, this is one play that's not gonna be commercial.
- Look, Charlie Brown, what do you want?
- The proper mood.
- We need a Christmas tree.
- Hey, perhaps a tree.
A great big, shiny, aluminum Christmas tree.
That's it, Charlie Brown. You get the tree.
I'll handle this crowd.
Okay. I'll take Linus with me.
The rest of you practice your lines.
Get the biggest aluminum tree you can find,
Charlie Brown, maybe painted pink.
Yeah, do something right for a change,
Charlie Brown.
I don't know, Linus. I just don't know.
Well, I guess we'd better concentrate on finding a nice Christmas tree.
I suggest we try those searchlights,
Charlie Brown.
This really brings Christmas close to a person.
Fantastic.
Gee, do they still make wooden Christmas trees?
This little green one here seems to need a home.
I don't know, Charlie Brown.
Remember what Lucy said?
This doesn't seem to fit the modern spirit.
I don't care.
We'll decorate it, and it'll be just right for our play.
Besides, I think it needs me.
This is the music I've selected for the Christmas play.
What kind of Christmas music is that?
Beethoven Christmas music.
What has Beethoven got to do with Christmas?
Everyone talks about how great Beethoven was.
Beethoven wasn't so great.
What do you mean,
Beethoven wasn't so great?
He never got his picture on bubble-gum cards, did he?
Have you ever seen his picture on a bubble-gum card?
- Hmm?
- How can you say someone is great...
...who's never had his picture on bubble-gum cards?
Good grief.
Say, by the way, can you play "Jingle Bells"?
No, no. I mean "Jingle Bells. "
You know, deck them halls and all that stuff.
No, no. You don't get it at all.
I mean "Jingle Bells. "
You know, Santa Claus and ho-ho-ho.
And mistletoe and presents to pretty girls.
That's it!
We're back.
Boy, are you stupid, Charlie Brown.
- What kind of a tree is that?
- You were supposed to get a good tree.
Can't you even tell a good tree from a poor tree?
I told you he'd goof it up.
He's not the kind you can depend on to do anything right.
- You're hopeless, Charlie Brown.
- Completely hopeless.
Rats.
You've been dumb before, Charlie Brown, but this time you really did it.
What a tree.
I guess you were right, Linus.
I shouldn't have picked this little tree.
Everything I do turns into a disaster.
I guess I really don't know what Christmas is all about.
Isn't there anyone who knows what Christmas is all about?
Sure, Charlie Brown.
I can tell you what Christmas is all about.
Lights, please.
And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field...
...keeping watch over their flock by night.
And, lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them...
...and the glory of the Lord shone round about them...
...and they were sore afraid.
And the angel said unto them:
"Fear not, for, behold,
I bring you tidings of great joy...
...which shall be to all people.
For unto you is born this day, in the city of David, a savior...
...which is Christ the Lord.
And this shall be a sign unto you.
Ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger. "
And suddenly, there was with the angel...
...a multitude of the heavenly host praising God and saying:
"Glory to God in the highest, and on Earth, peace, goodwill toward men. "
That's what Christmas is all about,
Charlie Brown.
For, behold,
I bring you tidings of great joy...
...which shall be to all people.
For unto you is born this day...
...in the city of David, a savior, which is Christ the Lord.
And this shall be a sign unto you.
Linus is right.
I won't let all this commercialism ruin my Christmas.
I'll take this little tree home and decorate it...
...and I'll show them it really will work in our play.
First prize?
Oh, well.
This commercial dog is not going to ruin my Christmas.
I've killed it. Oh...
Everything I touch gets ruined.
I never thought it was such a bad little tree.
It's not bad at all, really.
Maybe it just needs a little love.
Charlie Brown is a blockhead, but he did get a nice tree.
What's going on here?
Merry Christmas, Charlie Brown.

I suppose it all started with the snow.
You see, it's a very special kind of snow.
A snow to make the happy happier and the giddy even giddier.
A snow to make a homecoming homier and natural enemies friends, naturally.
For it was the first snow of the season.
And as any child can tell you, there's a certain magic to the very first snow...
...鰖ellikle Noel arifesinde ya瘕yorsa. especially when it falls on the day before Christmas.
For when the first snow is also a Christmas snow, well, something wonderful is bound to happen![Laughing]
[Ruler tapping] Children, back to your seats. The snow can wait.
Now, now. I've hired professor
Hinkle, the magician, to entertain at today's class
Christmas party, so pay attention!
Now, Professor Hinkle was just about the worst magician in the world.
And so, I put the magic eggs in to my hat.
Abracadabra, to coin a phrase... [Laugh]
And voila the eggs have turned in to...
Messy messy messy.
[Children groan]
Where IS that rabbit?
Hocus Pocus! Where are you?
Bah, the only thing this hat's good for is the trash can!
[Children laugh]
[Bell rings][Children cheer]
[Hinkle grumbles]
Hey, look at the snow! It's cold and snowy!
It's the best kind of snow! [etc.]
We're building a snowman, Karen.
You make the head!
The head is the most difficult part, ask anyone!
What will we call him?
Should we call him Harold? Nah.
[Mumbling]? Oh, No.
Oatmeal? Oatmeal?!
How about... Frosty?
Frosty?
Yeah! Frosty it is. Frosty the snowman!
[Cheers]
[Frosty the snowman, what a happy, jolly soul.
With a corn-cob pipe and a button nose, and two eyes made out of coal.]
Frosty the snow -
Come back here, you!
Happy Birthday!
That hat brought Frosty to life.
It must be magic.
Magic? My hat, magic?
Just look.
If that hat is magic, I want it back.
But it's not yours anymore!
You threw it away!
Don't talk back to your elders, you naughty naughty little girl.
And you, stay in there, or there will be no carrots for Christmas.
But you can't take that hat back, it brought Frosty to life
You saw it happen!
I saw nothing of the kind.
I saw nothing of the kind.
[Chattering]
Quiet, I can't lose that hat if it's really got magic now!
It'll make me a billionaire magician!
But we saw Frosty come to life, didn't we? Uh-huh, we sure did.
You silly children believe everything you see.
When you're grown up you'll realize that snowmen can't come to life.
But we -
Silly, silly silly!
Aw, Frosty, we don't care what grown-ups say, we know you DID come to life.
We know, Frosty. We just know.
#Frosty the snowman, was a jolly, happy soul.
With a corn-cob pipe and a button nose, and two eyes made out of coal.
# Frosty the snowman is a fairy-tale they say.
He was made of snow but the children know how he came to life one day.
Now, of course, the hat did belong to
Frosty and the children.
That part must be made very clear.
Therefore, Hocus Pocus was entirely in the right in what he was about to do.
Well, Hocus Pocus raced back to the children just as fast as he could.
[Hocus Pocus whistles]
Look! The hat's back. Let's see if it will make Frosty alive again.
Happy Birthday!
Hey, I said my first words...
But snowmen can't talk.
Alright, come on now, what's the joke.
Could I really be alive?
I mean, I can make words, I can move.
I can juggle, I can sweep, I can count to 10.
Well, I can count to 5. [laughing]
What do you know? I'm even ticklish.
In fact, I'm all living. I am alive!
What a neat thing to happen to a nice guy like me. [Children cheer]
#There must have been some magic in that old silk hat they found.
# For when they placed it on his head he began to dance around.
# Frosty the snowman was alive as he could be and the children say he could laugh and play just the same as you and me.
Uh oh...
What's the matter, Frosty?
Whew, is there a thermometer around here?
Over there on the wall, why?
Oh, I was afraid of that. The thermomter is getting red. I hate red thermometers.
Why, Frosty?
'Cause when the thermometer gets all reddish, the temperature goes up.
And when the temperature goes up,
I start to melt. And when I start to melt...
I get all wishy washy!
Then you've gotta go some place where you'll never melt.
The only place I'd never melt is the north pole.
Then we've got to get you there!
Yeah, we'll take you downtown to the railroad station and put you on a train.
Great, I always wanted to see the town.
Let's make a party out of it!
Let's have a parade!
# Frosty the snowman knew the sun was hot that day, so he said let's run and we'll have some fun now before I melt away.
# Down to the village with a broomstick in his hand, running here and there all around the square, saying catch me if you can.
Come on kids, follow the leader!
# He led them down the streets of town right to the traffic cop, and he only paused a moment when he heard him holler stop.
[Cop blows whistle] Stop. Stop. Stop!
Alright, didn't you see that traffic light?
What's a traffic light?
Up there on the lamp post!
What's a lamp post?
Oh, do you want a ticket, wise guy?
I'd love one, to the north pole, please!
You've got to excuse him, sir.
Alright, didn't you see that traffic light?
You see, he just came to life and he doesn't know much about such things.
Oh, well, okay, if he just came to life.
[Cop blows whistle] Move along!
Them silly snowmen. Once they come to life they don't know nothing.
Come to life?! [Soft whistling]
[Snoring]
[Snoring]
We'd like a ticket to the north pole please.
Hmm... What? Yes.
The north pole? Oh, yes ma'am.
[Bonk, Ping, Tinkle, Scrabble, Doink]
Route you by the way of
Saskatchewan, Hudson Bay,
Nome Alaska, the Klondike, and Aurora Borealis!
Gotta make a change at
Nanuk of the Northville.
That'll be $3,000 and four cents, including tax.
Oh, but we don't have any money...
No money!?
[Bonk, Ping, Tinkle, Scrabble, Doink]
No money, no ticket! [Slam!]
[Sad music plays]
Now I'll never get to the north pole.
Oh, Frosty, you just can't melt!
Oh, Karen, don't you get all slushy too.
What is it, Hocus? Out the window?
A refrigerated boxcar on a train headed north.
You'll be safe there, Frosty! Come on!
It's full of ice cream and frozen Christmas cakes.
What a neat way to travel!
[Whistle blows]
Hurry up, Frosty, the train is pulling out!
Are you coming to the north pole, too?
I'm sure my mother won't mind, as long as I'm home in time for supper.
[Whistle blows]
# Frosty the snowman had to hurry on his way, but he waved goodbye saying don't cry. I'll be back again some day.
I must get that hat back.
Think, nasty, think, nasty, think nasty. [Evil laughter].
# He'll be back again some daaaaaaaaaay.
Now actually, a refrigerated boxcar is a splendid way to travel.
Splendid that is... if one is a snowman or a furry coated rabbit.
But for Karen...
[Sneeze] Are you cold, Karen?
Now that's a silly question.
You wouldn't be sneezing if you weren't cold.
Well... just... just a lit... little.
[Sneeze]
Frosty realized that Karen had to get out of that car as soon as possible.
So when the little freight train stopped to let an express full of happy
Christmas travelers pass,
Frosty took advantage of the opportunity and quickly got them all off.
Oh, you tricked me! No fair!
The only thing professor Hinkle could do was make a jump for it.
[Bonk, Ping, Tinkle, Scrabble, Doink]
[Howling wind]
Frosty wanted to get as far away as he could before Hinkle woke up.
[Hocus' teeth chatter]
[Sneeze]
But the woods through which they traveled were still bitterly cold.
Hocus, I've got to get Karen all warmed up or she's a gonner!
I can't make a fire. Oh boy, that's one thing I really can't do.
I guess we just better keep moving until we find somebody who can.
Then suddenly they came upon a tiny glen which seemed almost magical.
For it was Christmas eve and the woodland animals were all decorating for their big celebration.
They knew Santa was to come that night and they wanted everything to be just right.
Hocus, speak to the animals.
See if they won't all pitch in and build a fire for Karen.
[Squeaky noises]
The animals were delighted to help. so they found a spot away from the glen where the fire wouldn't catch on to the trees.
Soon there was a spark and in almost no time a splendid fire was crackling away.
Frosty was careful to stay far away from the flames.
Hocus, we've got to find someone to help Karen get home before she freezes.
And me to the north pole before I melt, but who?
No, not the Marines.
No, not the president of the United States.
Oh, they were both swell ideas, but we've got to find someone nearby.
Yeah, Santa Claus. That's a great idea.
Why didn't I think of that before?
Hocus, you go back with the animals and when Santa comes, you bring him right here.
Understand?
Hurry now!
So Frosty kept a silent vigil, waiting patiently all through the night until Santa would arrive.
But suddenly...
Oh, a campfire.
Well isn't that all snug and comfy?
[Evil laughter]
[Professor Hinkle blows]
No! Don't!
Now give me that hat or else!
Or else what?
Well don't bother me with details, give me that hat!
Get on my shoulders, Karen!
You see, Frosty, since he was made of snow himself was the fastest belly-whopper in the world.
And old professor Hinkle was soon far outdistanced.
And now it was Frosty's good fortune that right at the bottom of the hill was a tiny greenhouse used to grow precious tropical poinsettias for Christmas.
It's got to be all warm and snug inside for those Christmas flowers to grow so beautiful.
Let's go in.
Oh, but, but you will melt!
Just a little. I'll only stay inside for a minute.
Besides, I've been meaning to take off a little weight anyway.
Whew, stay in here much longer and
I'll really make a splash in the world.
Now I've got you, and the minute you're all melted the hat will be mine! [Evil laughter]
Santa had arrived but was he too late?
Hocus explained the situation to Santa, who (as you know) speaks a fluent rabbit.
And when they didn't find
Frosty and Karen on the hill...
Santa followed Frosty's path in the snow to the greenhouse.
But when they got inside, a terrible sight met their eyes.
[Karen weeping]
[Sad music plays]
# (Very slowly) Frosty the snowman was a happy, jolly soul with a corn-cob pipe and a button nose and two eyes made out of coal.
They were too late.
Too late? Why, nonsense!
Don't cry, Karen.
Frosty's not gone for good.
You see, he was made out of Christmas snow and Christmas snow can never disappear completely.
Oh, it sometimes goes away for almost a year at a time and takes the form of
Spring and Summer rain, but you can bet your boots that when a good jolly
December wind kisses it, it will turn in to Christmas snow all over again!
Yes, but he was my friend.
[Chuckle] Just watch.
Wait a minute!
I want that hat and I want it now!
Don't you dare touch that!
And just what are YOU going to do about it?
If you so much as lay a finger on the brim,
I'll never bring you another
Christmas present as long as you live.
Never?
Never!
No more trick cards or magic balls or...
No more anything.
Oh, that's not fair.
I mean, we evil magicians have to make a living too.
Now you go home and write "I am very sorry for what I did to Frosty" a hundred zillion times.
And then maybe, just maybe, mind you... you'll find something in your stocking tomorrow morning.
A new hat maybe?
Oh, yes sir. Goodbye everyone.
Sorry to lose and run, but I've got to get busy writing.
Busy busy busy!
Come on, Frosty, we're all waiting for you.
Happy Birthday!
#Frosty the snowman is a fairy-tale they say.
He was made of snow but the children know how he came to life one day.
And so Santa took Karen home and made ready to bring Frosty back to the north pole.
Karen hated to say goodbye to Frosty, but as Santa promised, Frosty returned every year with the magical Christmas snow.
And every year there was a great celebration with a great Christmas parade.
#Thumpity thump thump thumpity thump. Look at that Frosty go.
Thumpity thump thump thumpity thump. Over the hills of snow.
#Frosty the snowman, was a jolly, happy soul.
With a corn-cob pipe and a button nose, and two eyes made out of coal.
And with Frosty the snowman,
Christmas was always very merry indeed.
You have a merry Christmas too!
#Frosty the snowman had to hurry on his way, but he waved goodbye saying don't you cry.
I'll be back on Christmas day!

Hi Crutch.
Give me my balloon!
Hey! The musician's going away!
Catch him!
Give us your balalaika!
Why are you vexing him?
Go on, don't be afraid.
Hello.
Don't cry. Don't cry.
What's the matter, dear?
"B" is a good mark.
Don't get carried away, Sasha.
And don't sway.
From the top!
This is uneven.
What's wrong with you?
One more time, from the top.
Tempo. Tempo.
Count time, Sasha.
Once again.
That's enough.
What should I do with you?
Too much imagination.
Good-bye.
Wait, Seryoga!
Stop! Stop!
- Come on down. Let's boogie.
- What?
Let's boogie.
When you go to lunch, get me some ice-cream
And get yourself an Eskimo pie.
I know you. You'll get one for me and you'll go hungry.
Sergei, need any help? Or do you want to do it yourself?
Or I'll run into the building and bring 15 people down.
Give me the wrench.
Can't you see it?
There it is.
Look, the musician is there.
Come over here.
What?
Want a ride? Come on.
What's this handle for?
It's not a handle, it's the reverse.
Reverse? Where's the drive?
- There isn't any.
- What do you mean?
- It disappeared.
- That's impossible!
- Everything's possible.
- Then how come we're driving forward?
Aren't you smart? Here it is.
Can't you get by without a helper?
Want me to answer to her?
- Forget her.
- What?
Do you want to drive?
Let's go!
Musician!
- See that?
- So what?
Push on forward.
Then pull back sharply.
Get down, musician!
All you are good for is fiddling.
Look at him.
Stop! Good job.
- How about one more ride?
- No, we'll be late for lunch.
Move on kids.
You're in the way.
Alright worker.
Let's go for lunch.
I'm coming.
- Leave me alone, Vic.
- Are you gonna do it again?
That's not fair.
- Let's save him.
- You save him.
- And you?
- Two against one?
- But I have this.
- I'll hold it.
See you later.
Why pick on someone who's smaller than you?
Excuse me?
Let go of him, or I'll hit you!
Go ahead!
Where are you going?
Come on.
Want me to hit you again?
- Where are you?
- Here.
Let's go then.
Your mom won't recognize you.
But if she does... who beat up who?
You'd better wash up.
Don't be scared of anybody.
I was beaten up a lot too.
I'm not scared.
I hit him so hard he just...
- A real worker.
- What kind of worker is he?
He's a musician.
- What did you say?
- A musician.
Oh, that got to you.
Come back here now!
What do you think you're doing?
What, you get your bread free?
Or do you think that loaves grow on trees?
Pick it up!
What if somebody threw your violin on the ground?
- What's your name?
- Sergei.
Hey, where are you?
Sergei!
- Where were you?
- I got lost.
Everything came crashing down.
Okay. Let's go.
My mother always boils my milk.
Why?
She's afraid I'll get brucellosis.
Don't drink it then.
- You drink it and you're ok?
- So far, so good.
Come on, come on, don't be shy.
Let me do that.
Thank you.
My music teacher smokes small cigarettes in orange packs.
That's Dukat.
I guess they're Dukat.
- These have no filter.
- Which ones are better?
Dukat are the stronger ones,
- but, hell, they're all bad.
- Why do you smoke, then?
- Do you bite your nails?
- Yes I do.
Isn't that a habit?
What's good about it?
- Have you ever been in a war?
- What?
- Have you ever been in a war?
- I have.
Was it scary?
It must be scary to be in a war.
I was about your age then.
I knew you were in the war.
You know everything, don't you?
Get me the pliers from under the seat.
We'll fix it.
- These?
- No, the other ones.
Wow!
This must cost a lot of money.
It cost only 60 rubles. It's a half.
Doesn't look like a half.
That's what a child's size violin is called.
When my fingers get as big as yours
I'll get a real violin.
A whole one, in about five years.
- How long have you studied it?
- Two years.
- How old are you?
- Seven.
How long must you study to be a violinist?
Long time.
My teacher says all my life.
I guess you have to start young to get used to it.
Want to hold it?
It's light.
What are those zig zags?
Sound holes.
To improve the sound.
They're resonators.
From the word "resonance".
If the resonance is good the sound is good.
If it's bad, the sound is bad.
Hear that? Not too good.
Here it's better.
Would you play something for me?
Okay, brother. Back to work.
How long will you be working here?
We finish today.
What's that?
Put some iodine on it at home.
It's always like that.
It's from my violin.
- Did you see "Chapayev"?
- Yes. Why?
Nothing special. There's a cinema across the street.
- Wanna go?
- Okay!
I'll meet you by the gate at 7.
Don't be late.
- 7 o'clock?
- 7 o'clock.
- Sasha?
- Mom?
My goodness!
What hands! What's that?
Axle grease.
- From what?
- Like oil.
- Did you practice?
- For three hours.
You mean you played with such dirty hands?
Go wash them.
You've upset me again.
It won't come off: it's axle grease.
Besides, I'm in a hurry.
I have to go downstairs.
- Go where?
- Downstairs.
I have a new friend.
He drives a steamroller.
You know, he paves...
Stop the "you know".
Why do you always say "you know"?
Does your friend do that too?
- What will you two do?
- We'll go see "Chapayev".
But we don't know him.
Why didn't you invite him over?
- He won't come.
- Why not?
- He just won't.
- Why not? I asked you, why?
Mom, he's waiting for me.
I promised.
Indeed.
Have you forgotten that Natasha and her mother are visiting you today?
You told them you'd be home.
That was a promise too.
That's no way to behave.
Mom...
Hey kid, do you know where Sasha lives?
What bit him?
Sasha! Come inside at once.
IT'S NOT MY FAULT. MY MOTHER
WON'T LET ME GO. SASHA.
What are you doing here?
Waiting for someone?
I'm going to see "Chapayev".

SMALL BOY:. l won't go to bed, Nana. l won't go to bed.
-Liza, is it 6:.OO yet?
-Yes.
Please, Nana, do l have to go to bed?
[Nana barks]
Liza,we're pretending we're Mother and Father and we're going to the ball tonight. Come play.
Always playing games. l have much more important things to do... than play at make-believe and dancing.
[Singing]
One,two,three, one,two,three
MOTHER:. Wendy,John.
WENDY:. Oh, Mother!
JOHN:. You look lovely.
MOTHER:. Oh,thankyou.
What are you doing in my hat?
We're doing an act.
Yes. We're playing at being you and Father. l'm Father.
A little less noise there a little less noise.
Mother,they never let me play
Father. They never let me dance.
Well,we'll soon fix that.
There. May l have the honor ofthis dance, Mr. Darling?

FATHER:. Mother! Mother!
WENDY:. Oh, it's Father.
Oh,there you are, Mother.
MOTHER:. What's the matter
Father dear?
The matter? This tie. It will not tie, not round my neck.
Round the bedpost, oh,yes, but round my neck, no.
Oh, dear no.
Begs to be excused.
Say it again, Father.
Say it again.
A little less noise there. l warn you ofthis, that unless this goes round... my neck properly,we don't go out to dinnertonight. lfwe don't go out to dinner, l'll never go to the office again, and if l never go to the office again,we will starve... and our children will be flung into the streets.
CHILDREN:. Oh, no, Father!
Wait a minute, Father dear. l think l've got it.
Oh! One more day when all is right.
Oh, Nana, Nana.
Mother, look here.
Hairs all over my trousers.
Clumsy, clumsy.
-l'll brush them off, Father.
-Thankyou.
There's times l think it's a mistake... to have a dog for a nurse.
Oh, George. Nana's a treasure.
No doubt. But l sometimes have a sorrt offeeling... that she looks upon the children as her puppies.
George,we must keep Nana. l'll tell you why.
Get ready for bed, children.
Nana will take you.
That's right.
Now, run along.
George.
Tonight l saw a face at the window.
Face at the window two floors up? lt was a face of a little boy.
He was tying to get in.
Oh, it's impossible.
That's not the first time l've seen that boy.
-Oh?
-The first time was a week ago. l remember because it was
Nana's night off. l was sitting there by the fire, and suddenly l felt a draft... as though the windowwere open. l looked... and l sawthat boy in the room. l screamed.
Just then, Nana came back and sprang at him at once.
The boy leapt at the window.
Nana closed it quickly.
-lt was too late to catch him.
-l thought so.
But wait! He escaped, but his shadow hadn't time to get out. l hid it. l rolled it up.
-And here it is.
-Aha!
Well, l don't think it's anyone we know, though he does look a scoundrel.
You know, l think he comes back tying to get his shadow.
-l daresay.
-But wait! l haven't told you all.
The boy was not quite alone.
He was accompanied by... l don't know howto describe it.
A ball of light no biggerthan my fist... that darrted around the room like a living thing.
This is most unusual.
-George,what can it mean?
-What indeed?
What indeed?
Oh, Nana! Oh, my knee! My knee!
WENDY:. Father, she's cying.
She's cying? What about me?
Go and coddle her.
Nobody ever coddles me. l'm only the breadwinner.
Why should l be coddled?
Why,why,why?
Not so loud.
Liza will hear. l refuse to allowthat dog to lord over me in my nursey... one hour longer.
WENDY:. Oh, Father! ln vain, in vain. Your place is downstairs. Come on, Nana.
MOTHER:. George.
Rememberwhat l told you about that boy?
Am l master in this house or is she? Come on, Nana.
[Nana barks]
FATHER:. Ow!
Come, Nana.
Good Nana.
Nice Nana.
Dear Nana.
Pretty Nana.
Gotcha! Come out! This way!
[Family protesting]
Oh, he's chaining Nana up!
FATHER:. Out the dooryou go.
JOHN:. She's unhappy.
FATHER:. No, no. There,there.
That's not her unhappy bark.
That's her bark when she smells danger.
Wendy, are you sure?
Yes, Mother.
[Nana barking]
WENDY:. Is eveything all right? lt's all quiet and still. l wish l weren't going out to dinnertonight.
MICHAEL:. Can anything harm us, Mommy, afterthe night-lights are lit?
No, precious. They're the eyes a mother leaves behind... to guard her children.
Now sing your good-night song... and into your beds.
[Singing]
Tender shepherd,tender shepherd
Let me help you count your sheep
One in the meadow
Two in the garden
Three in the nursey, fast asleep
MICHAEL:. Tender shepherd, tender shepherd
JOHN:. Tender shepherd, tender shepherd
WENDY:. Tender shepherd, tender shepherd
Watches over all his sheep
One, say your prayers
And two, close your eyes
And three, safe and happily, fall asleep
Fall asleep
Fall asleep
Fall asleep.
Dear night-lights that protecct my sleeping children, burn clear and steadfast tonight.
[Nana barking]
[Bell tinkling]
Tinker Bell.
[Nana barking]
Tinker Bell!
Tink! Where are you?
[Tinkling]
There you are.
Tink, do come out ofthat jug.
Do you knowwhere it is?
[Tinker Bell tinkling]
Overthere?
My shadow! l'll stickyou on with soap.
My shadow,what's the matter with you?
Boy,why are you cying?
What's your name?
Wendy Myra Angela Darling.
What's your name?
Peter Pan.
Where do you live?
Second to the right and straight on till morning. ls that what they put on your letters?
Don't get any letters.
But your mother gets letters.
Don't have a mother.
-Oh, Peter!
-You mustn't touch me!
But why?
No one must evertouch me.
Why not? l don't know.
No wonderyou were cying. l wasn't cying about that. l can't get my shadow to stick on. lt's come off? How awful!
Oh, ha ha ha! Peter!
You've been tying to stick it on with soap.
-Well,then?
-l'll have to sew it on foryou, my little man.
-Thankyou.
-Now,you sit there. l daresay this will hurrt a little. l never cy.
[Peterwhistling]
There!
Thankyou.
PETER:. Wouldn't you know it!
My shadow!
My vey own shadow!
WENDY:. But it's only a shadow.
Yes, but it's all mine.
Oh, l'm clever!
Oh,the cleverness of me!
WENDY:. Of course, l did nothing.
You're conceited!
Conceited?
[Singing]
Not me lt's just that l am what l am
And l'm me
When l look at myself and l see in myself
All the wonderful things that l see lf l'm pleased with myself l have evey good reason to be l gotta crow l'm just the cleverest fella
'Twas ever my forrtune to know l taught a trickto my shadow
To stickto the tip of my toe l gotta crow l gotta brag l think it's sweet l have fingers and feet l can wiggle and wag l can climb trees and play tag with the breeze ln the meadows below l gotta crow lf l were a vey ordinay
Eveyday thing l'd never be heard
Cock-a-doodlin' round like a bird
So naturally
When l discoverthe cleverness of a remarkable me
How can l hide it
When deep down inside, it just tickles me so?
That l gotta let go
And crow
[Crows]
Ha ha ha! l'm really a rare thing
Such a fairthing l can't keep still l'm bursting with pride
And l just couldn't keep it inside lf l tried
So naturally
When l discoverthe cleverness of a remarkable me
How can l hide it
When deep down inside, it just tickles me so?
That l gotta let go
And crow
[Crowing]
Oh, Peter,you are so clever.
Peter, how old are you? l don't know. l ran away from home the day l was born.
Ran away? Why?
Because l heard Father and Mother discussing... what l was to be when l became a man. l want to always be a little boy and have fun.
So l ran away, and l've lived a long time among the fairies.
Oh, Peter!
Do you really knowfairies?
Yes.
But they're nearly all dead now.
You see,Wendy,when the first baby laughed forthe first time, the laugh broke into a thousand pieces, and they all went skipping about.
And that was the beginning offairies.
So now evey time a new baby is born, its first laugh becomes a faiy.
There ought to be a faiy for evey girl and boy.
WENDY:. Ought to be? Isn't there?
Oh, no.
Children know such a lot now.
Soon,they don't believe.
And evey time a child says
''l don't believe in fairies,'' there's a faiy someplace that falls down dead.
WENDY:. Poorthings! l can't think where she's gone to.
-Tink!
-Peter!
You don't mean to tell me there's a faiy in this room?!
She came here with me.
[Rattling]
Wendy, l believe l've shut her up in that drawer.
[Tinker Bell tinkling]
Well,you needn't say that.
[Tinker Bell tinkling]
Well, l'm vey sory.
Well, how did l know you were in the drawer?
Tink,this lady wishes you were herfaiy.
[Tinker Bell tinkling]
What did she say?
She's not vey polite.
She says you're a great ugly girl, and she's mine.
Tink,you knowyou can't be my faiy because l'm a gentleman, and you're a lady.
[Tinker Bell tinkling]
What did she say?
She said, ''You silly ass.''
She's quite a common girl, you know.
[Nana barks]
Oh, it's all right.
She's chained up.
Peter,where do you live?
PETER:. Way out there!
WENDY:. Well, how do you find yourway home?
You just follow all the golden arrows.
Where do they lead you? lt's a secret place.
Oh, please tell me.
Would you believe me if l told you? l promise.
PETER:. For sure?
WENDY:. For sure.
Then l'll tell you.
[Singing] l have a place where dreams are born
And time is never planned lt's not on any charrt
You must find it with your hearrt
Never Never Land lt might be miles beyond the moon
Or right there where you stand
Just keep an open mind
And then suddenly you'll find
Never Never Land
You'll have a treasure ifyou stay there
More precious farthan gold
For once you have found yourway there
You can never, never grow old
And that's my home where dreams are born
And time is never planned
Just think of lovely things
And your hearrt will fly on wings
Forever ln Never Never Land
Peter,what does it look like? lt's an island,Wendy.
A large one?
No. Quite small... and nicely crammed... with hardly any space between one adventure and another.
Oh, it sounds lovely.
Who else lives there, Peter?
The Lost Boys.
Who are they?
They're the children who fall out oftheir carriages... when the nurse is looking the otherway. lfthey're not claimed in 7 days, they're sent far away to Never Land. l'm captain!
What fun it must be!
Yes...
But we're rather lonely.
Peter,why did you come to our nursey window?
To hearthe stories.
None of us know any stories.
How perrfecctly awwful.
Wendy...
Your motherwas telling you such a lovely stoy.
Oh? Which stoy is it? lt was about the prince.
And he couldn't find the lady who wore the glass slipper.
Oh. That's ''Cinderella.''
He found her.
And they lived happily ever after. l'm glad!
Where are you going?
-To tell the other boys!
-Oh, please don't go! l know lots of stories.
Do you?
WENDY:. Oh,the stories l could tell the other boys.
Come on. We'll fly.
Fly? You can fly?
Wendy, come with me.
Oh, howwe should all respecct you.
And you could tuck us in at night and make pockets for us.
None of us has any pockets.
Would you teach John and Michael howto fly? lfyou like.
John! Michael! Wake up!
There's a boy here who's going to teach us to fly.
MICHAEL:. There is?
JOHN:. l'll get up at once.
[Nana barking]
Someone's coming. Quick! Hide!
[Nana barking]
There. You see?
They are perrfecctly safe and sound asleep in bed.
[WoofWoof]
Now, no more.
Go along,you naughty dog.
[Nana barking]
All clear!
MICHAEL:. Fly!
JOHN:. Can you really fly?
-l'll teach you.
-How lovely to fly. l'll teach you to jum,p on the wind's back and away we'll go!
-Ooh!
-Wendy,when you're sleeping... in your silly bed,you might be flying about with me, saying funny things to the stars.
MICHAEL:. How do you do it?
You just think lovely, wonderrful thoughts, and up you go! l'm flying! l'm flying!
[Peter singing] l'm flying
CHILDREN:. Flying!

'Twas he cut off me arm. l've waited long to shake hands with him with this.

Yet l've oft heard you say... your hookwas worrth a score of hands... for combing the hair and other homely uses.
Aye. If l were a mother, l should pray that me children be born with this... instead ofthat.
But Peterthrew me hand to a crocodile... who happened to be passing by, and that croc liked the taste of me hand so much he's followed me ever since from land to land, from sea to sea he follows the ship licking his lips forthe rest of me.
Well, in a way, it is a sorrt of compliment.
Well, l want no such compliments. l want Peter Pan,who first gave the brute his taste for me.
Smee,that crocwould have got me long ere this... if it could have crept upon me unawares.
But by some lucky chance, it swallowed a clock.

And it goes tick-to,ck-tick within him and so before he can reach me l hearthe tick and bolt!

[Captain Hook singing]
To cook a cake quite large
And fill each layer in between
With icing mixed with poison
Till it turns a tempting green
We'll place it nearthe house
Just where the boys are sure to come
And being greedy
They won't care to question such a plum
The boys who have no mother sweet
No one to showthem their mistake
Won't know it's dangerous to eat
So damp and rich a cake
And so before
The blinking of an eye
Those boys will eat that poison cake
And one by one
They'll die
HOOK:. Olé!
PIRRATES:. Bravo! Bravo!
Oh, no. Stop it!

And nowto rescue Wendy!
NARRRATOR:. It is night in Never Land.
Not farfrom the Mermaids' Lagoon, one green light squinting over Kidd's Creek, which is nearthe mo,uth ofthe Pirate River marks where the ship
The Jolly Roger lies at anchor.
A rakish-looking craft, fore to the hull she lies low in the darkwater wrapped in the blanket ofthe night, a cannibal ofthe seas.
How still the night is.
Nothing sounds alive.
Now is the hourwhen child,ren in their homes are abed their lips bright-browned with a good-night chocolate... and theirtongues drowsily searching for belated crumbs... housed insecurely on their shining cheeks.
Compare with them,the captive children on this boat!
Split me infinitives, but 'tis me hour oftriumph--
Peter killed at last... and all the boys about to walkthe plank.
At last, l've reached me peak! l'm the greatest villain of all time!

Years came and went without bringing the careless boy.
Wendy tried,for Peter's sake, not to have growing pains, but,you see, all children except Peter grow up.
