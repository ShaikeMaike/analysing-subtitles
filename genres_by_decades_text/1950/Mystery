Did she have a Japanese boyfriend?
I told you, I never mixed in her personal business.
What'd you have against her?
Who said I had anything against her?
She was shifty as smoke, but I liked her.
Then why didn't you try and stop him when he went for her with a gun?
I didn't like her that much.
But you got a good look at him, didn't you?
Not good enough to recognize him.
You're worried already, eh?
Well, sure. Who wants to stick his neck out identifying somebody?
This Romeo she's been seeing on the QT, why the big secret?
I told you. I was her manager, not her wet nurse.
We all knew she was making time with some guy.
Why she wanted to keep him under wraps, who knows? Who cares?
This Oriental artwork belonged to her or to the house?
It's all Sugar's, all of it. Or was.
Research for the Crimson Kimono, the new act she was working on.
Will you fill us in?
- You want the routine?
- Yup.
It was just an act she was going to crack Vegas with, that's all.
- You really want to hear it?
- That's right.
Sure, sure.
It'll be a pleasure, gentlemen.
Picture this geisha house setting, and the curtain slowly going up on this guy cracking a real brick in half with his bare hands.
- Just like that.
- Karate?
Yeah, that's what they call it.
This guy could bust anything in half with the palm of his hand.
You saw him break a brick in half?
I never laid eyes on him. Sugar filled me in on the whole routine.
- What's his name?
- You got me.
I don't know where he lives or hangs out.
- How come?
- Well, they never ran through the routine here.
Only in her apartment.
- Did she always make the deals?
- Never before.
That's what's so screwy about this.
But she did let you in on the routine, eh?
That, she couldn't hold back, because it was such a great idea.
- Well, let's get back to the act.
- Sure.
Just use your imagination now.
This...this gorgeous geisha makes her entrance in a crimson kimono, the same one she posed in for that painting.
It's Sugar Torch, but a brand new Sugar.
Not an inch of flesh exposed, only her face.
She begins dancing to Japanese music, and then she starts a real slow peel with this karate brick-smasher watching her.
Suddenly, her jealous boyfriend barges in, a samurai warrior with a sword.
- Hidaka, she called him.
- Willy Hidaka?
Yeah, yeah. You know him?
You're doing fine,
Mr. Casale. Go on.
Well...well, the two guys begin battling over her, bare hands versus sword.
The brick-crusher kills Hidaka with one blow, turns to collect Sugar, but she tosses herself on the dead warrior and begins to bawl.
The brick-crusher blows his top, kills her and exits as the curtain slowly comes down on the two dead lovers.
Sort of a
Romeo and Juliet touch.
How do you like that for a striptease act?
Sergeant Bancroft.
- Mr. Casale, where can I find this Chris?
- Who?
Chris, the artist who made this painting of Sugar?
- Never heard of him.
- Where'd she have it made?
Who knows?
Maybe McAllister knows.
Mac? I'll have a talk with her.
You got enough loot on you to play Santa Claus?
I'll manage.
It's more than just strength in this karate business, Willy.
It's a combination of coordination and concentration.
Let me try it.
- How you doing, champ?
- Hi, Joe.
What are you trying to prove?
I have to qualify for something, Joe.
I even goofed at kendo.
You can fill in for me. I don't think
Charlie and I can make it this time.
- You kidding? You guys can't back out now.
- We're on a case.
- Dough was spent advertising that contest.
- That's right, Joe.
You guys haven't missed a match in five years.
Anyway, my money says that Charlie is going to pound you into a fish cake this year.
Willy Hidaka, the samurai warrior.
Now you got it made, boy.
Hey, how'd you find out about that?
You didn't tell those jokers down at the pool hall about it, did you?
I figured you had a reason for playing it close to the vest.
How'd you land the job?
- You want to get in the act, too?
- Could be.
You won't believe this, Joe, but one day I get a call from a girl asking me up to her apartment.
Sugar Torch, the stripper.
How come she called you?
She said a friend of hers spotted me in Little Tokyo and recommended me for the part, because I'm built like a samurai.
Who was the talent scout?
Never got a chance to meet him.
Joe, if my father knew I was going to work with a stripper, he'd chop me like a ripe banana.
Me, Hidaka, doing an act with Sugar Torch.
Have an apple. There's not going to be any act.
She didn't replace me with another guy, did she?
Somebody shot her dead.
That poor little muffin.
- Hello, Mac.
- Charles, dear boy. Have a beer.
Rumor has reached Skid Row that Sugar Torch went out in a blaze of glory.
In front of a free audience.
Whom are you hunting, Charles?
How did you like that kimono painting of her?
A work filled with total youthful vibration.
Countless little strokes of pure crimson, rather than mixing colors on the palette.
- You like Chris' work?
- It shows promise.
Well, where can I find this promising Rembrandt?
Nude Ascending
Celestial Bodies.
Where can I find Chris, the artist who painted her in that kimono?
- What painting?
- Who was the karate hired for the act?
Shuto. He's a Korean.
He once killed a bull with one blow.
Do you know where he lives?
No. He's new in town and doesn't speak a word of English.
- How's his Japanese?
- Almost as bad as mine.
Aha! You think the jealous artist turned on his model?
Could be.
I think I see the bulge of a fragile friend in your pocket, dear boy.
Bourbon.
It's Latin, Charles, and it means,
"Put up or shut up."
Ha!
- I love you, Charles.
- You're a pearl, Mac.
Love does much, but bourbon does everything.
Now, where's this Chris?
Dear boy, I shall have to get blotto to remember.
Homicide. Bancroft.
McAllister reporting, front and center.
- Who?
- There's nothing like 100-proof heaven to make the mind clear and the...
And the memory sharp.
Mmm-hmm.
Thanks, Mac.
I do love you.
Yeah, I love you, too.
Room service.
610. Coffee tout de suite.
- Good morning, Sergeant.
- Good morning, Nat.
That striptease murder is all over the paper.
Sausage?
It gave me a heartburn last time.
Say, I saw that Sugar Torch.
It's too bad.
Hey, hey. Sausages?
- Two on a raft.
- Two on a raft.
Poached eggs, juice, the works.
Double it. Got that, Nat?
Righto, Sergeant.
Room service?
Hey, who's paying for this?
- Is this on the house?
- We're living it up this morning, Joe.
Living it up? You got rocks in your head or something?
What did you do, inherit a lot of loot?
No. Mac came through with a lead.
Great. Great.
The bourbon paid out.
- Uh-huh.
- Let's have it.
Well, that painter, Chris.
He's at the University of Southern California.
Well, I'll see what I can draw up on Shuto.
Hey, take it easy, will you? Come on.
We'll have this thing wrapped up before Sunday, anyway.
What's Sunday got to do with it?
That's action day for you and that babe from Gardena.
- What?
- That babe from Gardena. Remember?
Holy smoke, I forgot.
I'll have to tap her for a rain-check.
Don't be a meathead, Joe.
You've got that day off coming to you.
I'll get Ed Jokish to fill in for you.
- You'll what?
- I'll get Ed Jokish to fill in for you.
Listen, Charlie, I'm hanging on
'till we wrap it up.
Sister Gertrude.
Well, Charlie, that puts us both in business.
- I think I know where Shuto is.
- Joe, will you take it easy?
- Nobody cares who killed that tramp.
- Well, I do.
Will you quit pushing so hard, Joe?
You've got half that handbook memorized already.
You can say that again.
You'll make sergeant without busting a date over a burlesque queen. Anyway, the grapevine has it that that Gardena beauty's planning to have you meet her family.
That's another reason why I want a bypass.
She's a Kibei, you know. Born here, but raised in Japan.
So?
So? So we never agree on anything.
All we do is get into beefs about the old country.
- Are you kidding?
- Pretty corny, huh?
Man, you're really slipping if that's all you beef about with that babe.
Listen, Don Juan, you tackle Rembrandt at the school, and I'll shortstop Shuto.
You knucklehead.
Yes? Did you want me for something?
Well, I'd like to take that matter up with you another time.
I asked for the artist who made this painting.
It reproduced surprisingly well, didn't it?
- You're Chris?
- Mmm-hmm.
- Christine?
- Christine Downs.
Are you interested in sitting for me?
Why, you look disappointed.
Well, not in you, Miss Downs, but I was hoping Chris would be a man.
Are you allergic to women artists?
Well, I'm not here to sit for a portrait.
Not right now, anyway.
- Then you'll excuse me.
- I'm here on police business.
Detective
Sergeant Bancroft.
What kind of business?
- Sugar Torch.
- What's that?
Why, haven't you seen today's headlines?
This one, either?
I didn't pay particular attention. Why?
Well, the woman you painted was
Sugar, the stripper.
She was shot and killed last night on Main Street.
You see, someone put a bullet through your painting and another one through her neck.
Hey, are you all right?
Can I get you some water?
- No, thank you.
- Well, you see, Miss Downs, your painting was hanging in her dressing room in a burlesque house.
So far, it's the only lead we have to go on.
That poor woman.
How horrible.
- Then you liked her?
- Why, yes.
Where did you meet her?
Right here. A few weeks ago we held a Japanese art exhibit.
Miss Trent liked my work and Mr. Hansel commissioned me...
- Do you know Hansel's first name?
- No.
He paid me $75.
It's the very first time
I'd ever been paid.
Do you know where he lives or what kind of work he does?
No. He impressed me with his knowledge of Oriental customs.
How old is he? Can you describe him for me?
Well, he's in his mid-30s.
Brown hair and brown...
Yes, brown eyes.
- Now, where did you paint her?
- In her apartment.
- Why, he was there every time.
- Hansel, you mean?
He arranged the kimono, the obi, the wig.
Why would anyone want to kill her?
She was always so kind, so cooperative.
Well, once we find this Hansel  character, maybe all the pieces will fit.
I wonder if you'd do a big favor for me?
Do you think you could make a sketch of him?
- You mean Hansel?
- Yeah, Hansel.
- Right now?
- I sure do.
All right.
Miss Downs.
Did either of them mention a man called Shuto?
No.
Do I get you nervous, watching?
Well, it's just that I...
- Well, I...
- Look.
A lot of citizens cave in at the last minute when they think their identification might send somebody to the gas chamber.
That's what's bothering me.
You know, you used a lot of little strokes on that kimono painting instead of mixing them up on the palette.
- An art critic?
- No.
I'm just repeating what a friend told me.
She called your work
"total youthful vibration".
- She an artist?
- Yeah.
Mac's an artist.
You know, I...
I like the way you look in that smock.
I wish I could have heard that under different circumstances.
You suppose when you're finished with that sketch that I could have a little more of your time?
You don't look like a cop.
Well, now, that word doesn't fit those full lips of yours.
Well, you see, we don't like being called cops like girls don't like being called broads.
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.
May I ask what you want of me?
Strictly police business.
On the level.
This Mr. Shuto you saw last night...
- Mr. Shuto?
- I don't recall anyone by that name.
He's Korean, big man, built like a mountain.
He must be that unfortunate man who was so terribly frightened.
- And so sick.
- Drunk?
- I'm afraid he was intoxicated.
- Do you know where he lives or hangs out?
I'm sorry, Joe, but we know nothing about him.
- Have you tried the Korean consul?
- I've tried everywhere.
Gyms, judo schools, wrestling hangouts, arenas.
You said he was frightened.
Did he say of what or whom?
He was pitifully inarticulate, Joe.
But did he say anything at all?
He did ask for
George Yoshinaga.
- Uh-huh.
- Yes, and he was kind enough to come right over and help the poor man.
Yoshinaga took him away?
- Yes.
- I see.
Thank you, sisters, thank you.
- And how is Sergeant Bancroft?
- Give him our regards.
I sure will, sisters.
Thanks again.
Hey, look at the banners and lanterns.
What's the big celebration?
Well, day after tomorrow,
Nisei Week Festival opens with a bang.
You ever been down here in Little Tokyo?
No. I never knew that police headquarters was right across the street from the Japanese section.
What do they do for Nisei Week?
They have doll exhibits, judo, kendo matches.
Well, that street'll explode with parades, bands, gorgeous girls in kimonos.
It should give you a lot of ideas for paintings.
- How'd you like to see it with me?
- I'd love to.
Fine. Let's get back to work.
Now the first thing we'll do is narrow down our suspects to Sugar's former acquaintances.
- Hello, Mr. Yoshinaga.
- Hello, Joe.
- How are you?
- Just fine, thank you.
Mr. Yoshinaga, I understand you're a friend of Mr. Shuto's.
Yes. I hope he feels better today.
- You know where I can find him?
- I know a few places.
- Why don't you try...
- I'd appreciate it if you'd come with me.
- You see, I don't know him.
- Is he in police trouble?
No, but he can help us on a case.
Well, I made an appointment for my son's memorial service.
I've never missed one in nine years.
I'm sure we'll find Mr. Shuto right after the service.
- Koyasan Temple?
- Yes.
- Fine, come on.
- This news broadcast is interrupted for public service.
The Los Angeles police are looking for this man.
- Let's try the rice-cake factory.
- Okay.
- Spot him?
- Yes.
He's not going to get hurt, is he?
No, I'm just going to ask him a few questions, that's all.
He's the one in the gray suit.
Big man.
...you know, a few questions about the stripper, Sugar Torch.
- How are we doing?
- No luck yet.
Oh, no.
We've got a whole library of these mug books.
Give you a chance to study portraits.
I'll take landscapes from now on.
Is something wrong?
No. I'm just trying to figure out something.
What?
Well, what have we got to lose?
Do you think they'll worry about you tonight if you don't turn up at your sorority?
Straighten up.
Put your hat on.
Return.
Come back again.
Excuse me.
This is Miss Downs.
How do you do, Chris?
Just call me Mac.
Sit here, my dear.
I've been so anxious to meet you.
I asked to meet you.
Why all the urgency?
You want to join her art class?
Did you have good hunting at the show-up tonight?
- Blank.
- I made an awful blunder.
I thought Number 5 suspect was Hansel.
Wouldn't you know, he turned out to be a police officer.
I saw your sketch on TV, Chris.
- How did you know I made it?
- It's your style.
Thank you.
I wonder what
Hansel's name really is?
Why, how do you know it's not his name?
You bloodhounds would have had him stretched and quartered by this time if you knew his identity.
I've heard so many colorful stories about your work.
You'll find my murals in Skid Row's finest bars and brothels.
Do you have a lover?
Why do you ask?
Because there's just one more item to add to your work before we settle down to why I wanted to see if you were worth the trouble.
- What trouble?
- Do you mind if I offer my critique on her work before we start to fence?
- Did you score?
- Nope.
That Shuto gets around for a big guy.
- Did you order yet?
- Not yet.
Well, Mac, what was the big deal you had to talk about with Chris?
Chris is dead.
You are dead, Chris, if Hansel sees that sketch you made of him.
Why are you getting her all worked up with that kind of talk?
Mac, this is none of your business.
We know what we're doing.
I know what you'd do if anything happened to her.
You'd feel terrible about it.
Let's get out of here,
Chris. Come on, Joe.
You're very kind, Mac.
And you, my dear, are very young to have your neck smashed by a bullet.
Nobody's forcing you.
- Nobody.
- I know.
I'll be all right,
Mac. Good night.
"The third bullet struck Sugar in her flight on Main Street,
"killing her instantly."
- Want to hear more?
- Not particularly.
Have you seen the sketch of the killer?
Does it say he's the killer?
No, but he looks like one.
I don't like it.
- What do you mean?
- They should've had a real artist like you draw it. I mean, this is strictly amateurish.
Hello. Yes, just a minute.
Chris, it's for you.
- Hello?
- This is Mr. Hansel, Chris.
That sketch you made of me for the police was your last work of art.
- Are you sure you've had your coffee?
- No. No, thanks, Mac.
What makes it rough now is we've got two jokers to find.
Mmm-hmm. And I suppose Chris is in the hospital.
No. She wasn't hit.
What about her family?
Have you notified them?
She's afraid they'd haul her back home by jet.
And why not?
It seems like good sense to me.
Not to her. No, she's just as anxious to nail Hansel as we are.
Here, go on, have some. It's good for you. Go on. It's on the house.
Why don't you hole her up out of town?
Here. Come on.
I'll fix that one up for you.
Well, now, why don't you hole her up out of town?
She won't buy that. Even turned down a hotel room with a 24-hour guard.
Well, she's not being stupid enough to stay in that sorority den?
She moved in with us.
- She did, did she?
- Come off it, Mac.
Our place is jumping with plainclothes men.
Our set-up's healthy, except for one thing.
Aha. You want me to act as wet nurse.
Well, you speak her language.
When a woman is drafted as chaperone, that is not complimentary.
Charlie figured bird-dogging wouldn't appeal to you.
However, I'd do anything for dear Charles.
And free bourbon.
All you have to do is ring for it.
Are you feeling better now?
I try not to jump at every sound.
Well, it's only natural.
Right after the war, I nearly fell apart every time I heard a cup rattle a dish.
Do you mind if I talk to you while
I look at these?
It seems to make the time go faster.
Fire away, but just concentrate on those beauty winners.
The sooner we find Hansel, the quicker we'll score.
- Who plays the piano?
- Joe. I can't even carry a tune.
You know, this is a pretty fancy apartment for two policemen.
Don't let it throw you.
Some guys spend all their loot on clothes or horses or women.
We put every buck we got into this palace, and by the time the 6% pension takes a bite into our pay and the deducts take over, we're busted.
As soon as Joe makes sergeant it'll make this set-up a little easier to handle.
You've known him a long time?
Yeah, we met in a foxhole. I was a CO.
He was a rifleman.
- He got the Silver Star.
- Were all the Nisei so heroic?
Only one ever went AWOL.
He deserted a hospital bed to rejoin my outfit when we went back into action.
It's all right, Chris.
Thanks.
Here's some more pictures of suspects for you, Chris.
Chris, are you all right?
Chris?
Hey, are you okay?
I feel so silly, breaking up like this.
Let it pour out.
It'll do you good.
I just don't seem to be able to control myself.
You've got the best reason in the world to cry.
I've seen great big guys break down like kids.
And that lower lip of yours.
What's the matter with it?
The way you wet it makes me think of those movie stars, the way they wet theirs to make them look more sexy.
Do you come from a big family?
Everybody in your family have a nose like that?
You know,
I like an upturned nose.
I guess when you lift your head, the girls call you "snobhead", right?
Say, that school's co-ed, isn't it?
Do you...
Do you have a...
I'm just curious, that's all.
You know, Chris,
I've knocked around an awful lot.
Do you suppose after we wrap this case up, that you'd go out with a cop?
Yeah, you would?
Hello. Well, did you send for help?
Well, don't do anything foolish, Joe.
I'll be right there.
I don't want to shoot you.
I don't want to hurt you.
I don't want to shoot you, Shuto.
Shuto!
Take it easy, Shuto.
I don't want to hurt you.
There's no one by the name of
Hansel working here, but you know, it's a strange thing.
When I saw the sketch in the newspaper,
I showed it to Paul.
I even kidded him about the amazing resemblance.
- Who's Paul?
- Paul Sand. He specializes in Asia.
We'd like to have a talk with him.
You mean, you suspect Paul?
Believe me, Officers, when you meet him, you'll see why it's ridiculous.
I mean, I'm not running him down, but Paul Sand involved with a burlesque dancer?
Would you ask Mr. Sand to come to my office?
He what?
When?
Yes, yes, send him up.
This is a fantastic coincidence.
Paul Sand just resigned without explanation.
Anything?
Well, there's a Caucasian wigmaker due here any minute.
They think maybe she'd know since she gets around a lot.
Joe, do you remember back in Korea how
I used to laugh at a guy getting tied down to one woman for life?
Korea?
What took you back that far?
- Do you remember?
- Sure, I remember.
You made a big deal about how only Babbitts get married.
I'm a Babbitt.
- What are you talking about?
- Chris.
- You're batting 100% there.
- Yup.
How about Chris?
She pulling for you?
Sure. She knows how I feel, and I think the door's open for me.
Well, Charlie, I think it's great.
Kind of sudden-like, but great.
Me, I believe in taking a second look.
You know, just to make sure.
Yeah.
Well, I've wasted an awful lot of years,
Joe, but it was sure worth it.
- How do you do?
- Hi.
I have nine of them in the exhibit.
For the Festival?
Did you exhibit last year?
No. I've lived in San Francisco all my life.
Are you in the wig business?
- No, we're police.
- Have you ever seen this man?
- Who hasn't? That's Hansel.
- Do you know him?
Who doesn't? He's on every newspaper and every TV broadcast.
I mean, have you ever seen him in the flesh?
No, I haven't.
Isn't this a strange place for you to be looking for him?
I mean, does he have a wig business?
Well, he has a friend who's in it.
She specializes in
Oriental hairstyles.
- Caucasian?
- We don't know.
Well, there aren't very many of us in this business.
- There might be a few I don't know.
- Now, what's your name?
Roma Wilson.
Miss Wilson.
Well, thank you for your time, Miss Wilson.
Will you be coming to the exhibit? You might want to buy a doll for your girl.
Well, I may drop around to pick out a wedding gift for a friend of mine.
We'll have just the gift for you.
The phone call Charlie got, was it about the murder?
Mmm-hmm.
- Why the big secret?
- It's no secret.
Sometimes we have to depend on informers, and Ziggy's one of
Charlie's boys.
- Ziggy? Is that a name?
- It's his.
Well, did he know Sugar?
Those characters down there know everybody.
Normally, I'd have gone out with Charlie, you know, a team sticks together on a night job, but Ziggy made a big deal about wanting to see Charlie alone.
You'd better not have me down here on a phony, Ziggy. I'm not going to like it.
I'm sweating behind the eyeballs,
'cause I don't want no goofball pusher
- to know I'm fingering for you.
- Give out.
Well, I... I seen a character with Sugar a couple, three times.
I seen him with him again tonight.
That's why I rung you up.
Sugar knows lots of characters.
Yeah, but this one's got his picture in all the papers.
You're doing great.
Where'd you see him?
You won't forget it was Ziggy who was your big thumb?
Where is he?
Charlie tells me you're quite an expert at this kendo.
He's my best press agent until we start belting eachother with those bamboo bats.
He explained it was some kind of fencing.
I still don't understand it.
Actually, it's just to make the annual Nisei get-together a more colorful shindig.
It's good showmanship.
We wear robes and gauntlets and chest guards and masks.
You know, a kendo fighter looks like a monk in a catcher's outfit.
How about some after-dinner music?
I'd rather hear it live.
Hey, Charlie didn't pass me off as a Mozart, did he?
- Please?
- Okay.
- What was it?
- Akatonbo means "Red Dragonfly".
It's an old children's song.
- It's beautiful. Would you play it again?
- Sure.
What made you become a policeman, Joe?
I like the job.
- Just curious.
- Why?
I noticed the signature on this a little while ago.
You should be carrying a brush instead of a gun.
That's by Kojaku, all right, but not by this one. My father made it.
It's exquisite.
He was a pure artist.
He could imitate the effect of worn leather saddles.
He could get a delicate imprint of a cobweb.
He built landscapes against a floating sunset of scarlet dust.
That was the last lacquer he made.
He called it Gold in Ice.
Yeah, my father found his utopia.
And you found yours in the Detective Division?
It's Detective Bureau,
Homicide Division.
I'm sorry.
Forgive me?
To a lot of people, we're a strange breed, Chris, and maybe we are, but the work's steady.
You can't get fired unless you foul up, and there's the pension.
- That's not really why I wear a badge.
- I know.
- How do you know?
- A hunch.
The house with the stairs.
Behind me.
The room on the top with the light.
No, no, over there.
He's up there.
You won't forget it was Ziggy who found him for you?
- I won't forget, Ziggy.
- You won't forget, now, Sergeant?
Police! Police!
Lady, take it easy,
I'm a police officer. I'm a...
Take it easy!
Sit down over there.
Now just take it easy, will you?
Now, you see, that's me. Okay?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
Now, where's the man who lives here?
What are you talking about?
- This man? Recognize him?
- He's upside down.
Do you know him?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, he's gone.
- Where?
- I don't know or care.
- How long ago?
- Not 10 minutes. And he ain't coming back.
Well, did he go down by those stairs?
No. The front way.
How do you know he's not coming back?
Katie, he's asking me how do I know.
He took his bag.
That's why I'm cleaning up.
- How do I know?
- What kind of a bag did he have?
Katie, what kind of a bag?
I don't know or care.
What's going on in there?
Who in the hell is beating up who?
Any of you people know where Mr. Hansel went?
The guy that lived in here?
- You a cop?
- Yeah.
- I know nothing.
- How about you people?
Look, lady, mother...
And that's a beautiful child you have, a beautiful child.
- Did you ever see him with anyone?
- No.
- You got a phone here?
- No.
Well, look, if you should see him, would you please call the police and ask for me, ask for Sergeant Bancroft?
Not me, mister.
And you know why?
'Cause I keep my nose out of police business.
And you know why? 'Cause that's how
I keep my looks.
For a moment, I thought you were going to start comparing me with Rembrandt or da Vinci.
I don't mean to run your talent down, but when I look at anything by those guys, I'm floored for weeks.
Well, I'm sorry
I don't floor you.
Don't get me wrong, Chris.
I like that kimono painting you made.
- Why?
- Why?
It's hard for me to explain why
I like your work, just as hard as it is to explain why it's kind of unfinished.
- Mac been talking to you?
- What do you mean?
- About my painting?
- No, why?
I think it's very strange that you...
I'm really interested in finding out what you mean by "unfinished".
It's kind of hard to put a feeling like that into words.
But it's as if you were hunting for something and never got to find it.
What am I hunting?
I don't know, Chris.
I'm no longhair, but I'll try to explain it.
From the minute I saw your painting,
I felt you were looking for something that just never happened.
Kind of, as if you were sitting on the edge of a volcano.
I don't know, Chris.
I don't even know how I got started on this gibble-gabble.
I'm no art critic.
You're a much more sensitive critic than you realize.
I guess I got the knack from my father.
He could always read an artist's heartbeat just by looking at his work.
- Do you have a girl, Joe?
- You mean, hooked?
- Yes.
- Uh-uh.
One day the right girl'll come along, and you'll both know at first glance.
You believe in that eyewash?
No.
Neither do I.
- Joe?
- Yeah?
Do you believe there are people who'd never fall in love if they'd never heard of love?
You can't fight a natural feeling.
Then why are you?
Chris.
Let's not trigger off a bomb.
Get back to work.
What's the matter, Joseph?
What's wrong?
Please speak in English.
You know how it's helped me with my language.
I've got a problem, a girl.
- I love her.
- Who is she?
- Chris Downs.
- What is her Japanese name?
- Is she Caucasian?
- Yes.
Now I can see what is the problem.
That's not what is wrong.
I keep asking myself, how do I rate a girl like Chris?
Me, Joe Kojaku.
How do I rate her?
I don't understand.
- Because it would be wrong.
- For whom?
It's been filling up inside me all night, sensei.
I'm all mixed up.
I don't know what to do, or how to do it.
You came to me for help?
I've got to talk to somebody about it.
How can I help you when I do not know what your trouble is?
I didn't look to fall in love with her.
It happened.
Well, he's not in there.
Come on, let's go.
Well, I don't know where he could be holed up. What do you think?
Look, I don't mind doing a monologue, Joe, but something's bothering you.
What's the matter, didn't that chow settle right?
That bullet kicking up inside you again?
Huh?
What's the matter with you?
I feel like I'm with a zombie.
Come on.
I'll check in here.
You keep your eyes open in case he tries busting out the front way.
What's the matter with you?
Smoking a cigarette is like drinking beer out of a thimble.
A man is only a man, my dear, but a good cigar is a smoke.
Were you ever in love with a man from a different world?
Many, many times.
Well, was he someone of a different race?
There was a Hindu in Bombay.
Was he sensitive about the difference between you?
He wasn't, but his father looked down his imperious nose at me.
Why?
I love Joe Kojaku.
He's thrown a wall up between us, because he's Japanese.
Did you tell him that you loved him?
- He knows.
- And what did he say?
What could he say?
He froze.
- Because he's Japanese.
- What else?
I knew it from the way he talked, from plain, down-to-earth talk.
I could sense his embarrassment.
The whole room filled with it.
You don't know
Joe Kojaku.
- He won't let me.
- He's not fighting anything racial.
- Then what else could there be?
- There could be Charlie.
Mac, what does Charlie have to do with it?
He's in love with you, Chris.
That's what he has to do with it.
He told me, he told Joe, and by tomorrow, every badge down at
Headquarters will know that Charlie has finally fallen.
- I see.
- I don't think you do.
Chris, to understand Joe, you have to understand what Charlie means to him.
I do understand.
Mac, things like this have happened before.
Perhaps. But what those two had together in the war, no one can touch.
It was Joe's blood that kept
Charlie alive in Korea, and now it's Charlie's friendship that's keeping Joe alive.
It's like... Well, it's like mixing two dabs of paint together.
You can never separate them.
Look, Mac, I've never encouraged Charlie.
I've never... You make it all sound so heavy-handed.
Now that I know what's behind Joe's uneasiness, I'll...
- But it makes sense.
- It does, does it?
Look, Mac, I can straighten this out without any melodrama at all.
- I'll simply tell Charlie how I feel.
- You do that.
- Hello, Charlie.
- Hello, Chris.
- Mac.
- Blind alley?
Yeah, we got enough stakeouts to form a battalion.
- Where's Joe?
- Who cares?
- Well, what happened?
- He's got rocks in his head.
Something's eating him, the way he's clammed up.
I've never seen him mope like that.
Excuse me while
I go powder my abstract.
Well, didn't he even hint why he acted so strangely?
Nope.
Chris, did anything happen tonight?
Between you and Joe?
Did anything happen here tonight that could have thrown him?
What do you mean?
Well, sometimes people drop a remark.
Harmless one, you know.
No, I don't know.
Well, sometimes people forget, the word slips.
You mean a word about the Japanese?
Is that what you mean, Charlie? Charlie, you think that I'd say...
You think that
I'd embarrass him?
Charlie, how could you?
I'm sorry, Chris.
I'm sorry I hurt you.
Good night, Chris.
Good night.
Love is like a battle,
Chris.
Somebody has to get a bloody nose.
For the benefit of those not acquainted with kendo, it can best be described as an art of disciplined assault.
It can be dangerous if not executed according to the rules.
When a protagonist aims for the head, the torso, or the wrist, the targets will be called out.
When a contestant is hit in one of the three targets which has been called out, he loses the bout.
Ladies and gentlemen, we begin our kendo tournament of the Nisei Week Festival with last year's champions.
And representing the
Caucasian yudansha is Detective Sergeant
Charles Bancroft of the Los Angeles
Police Department.
And representing the Nisei yudansha is
Detective Joe Kojaku, also...
What's the matter with Kojaku?
He's breaking all the rules.
It's been eating inside me, and when you clobbered me, I blew my stack.
- I'm sorry.
- What's been eating inside of you?
Chris.
Right. Chris.
I'm in love with her.
She's in love with me.
That's how it is, Charlie.
On account of you,
I never even touched her.
I wanted to hold her in my arms, but I couldn't.
I didn't want to hit you that way, Charlie.
But it's not normal to keep my feelings bottled up.
That's it. It's out. It hurts, and there's nothing I can do about it.
Say something.
Blow your top.
Belt me. You've got the right to belt me.
You mean, you want to marry her?
You wouldn't have said it that way if I were white.
- What are you talking about?
- Look at you. It's all over your face.
- Have you gone crazy?
- What burns you is that you lost her to me.
- Is that what you think?
- It's not what I think. It's what I know.
The thought's made you sick to your stomach.
Look at your face.
It wasn't just plain normal jealousy.
That's why those words poured out of me.
When I saw his face,
I knew.
- You only saw what you wanted to see.
- You weren't there.
I know how he feels about those things.
I saw that look, Chris.
It's a look I've never seen before, on his face or anybody else's.
I'm no wet nose. Nothing like that should hit me below the belt, but it did.
He didn't mean it that way.
You don't have to mean it or say it. It's there all the time.
It's what you think is behind every word and every look.
You've got to wear my shoes to know what I'm talking about.
- But I do know.
- How could you know?
Honey.
How could you know?
You can't feel for me unless you are me.
Take a good look, Chris.
Do I look different to you than I did yesterday?
- Joe.
- Did my face change?
- Don't say that.
- I've got to say it.
I never felt this in the army, in the police.
Maybe it's 5,000 years of blood behind me busting to the front.
For the first time,
I feel different.
I taste it right through every bone inside me.
For the first time, I catch myself trying to figure out who I am.
I was born here.
I'm American.
I feel it and live it and love it, but down deep, what am I?
Japanese-American?
American-Japanese? Nisei?
What label do I live under, Chris?
You tell me.
I'm sorry, honey.
Why am I taking it out on you?
Because you're hurt, and it's the kind of pain I can't wipe out.
Joe.
If you had said you wanted no part of me, it'd have hurt, but I'd have understood.
I'd have bought it.
But, Charlie,
I'm wondering now, what was in his mind all these years?
What kind of cracks he made when I wasn't there?
It'll never work out,
Chris.
If he feels like that, what can I expect from you?
Everything.
Because I love you.
You'll only see in my face what you want to see.
Goodbye, Chris.
Will it do any good if I talk?
Nope.
Not even if you went off half-cocked?
- I'm not scouting for an apology.
- Apologize for what?
I apologize when I'm wrong, not when you put words in my mouth.
You're wasting your time.
Joe, you threw me off guard when you told me about Chris.
Maybe there was a look on my face.
It was a look of hate.
Normal, healthy, jealous hate.
Look at me, Joe.
You know me better than anybody else.
I'm even carrying a pint of your blood inside me, remember?
I never missed it.
I'm glad it's not a piece of your brain muscle.
When are you turning your badge in?
As soon as the Chief gets to his office.
Joe, the case isn't closed yet.
Mine is.
Well, I tried, Chris.
Believe me, I tried.
What are you doing here?
Anything.
Anything I can to convince you how wrong you are.
Joe, don't run.
Don't quit.
It's not the job.
It's what it represented to you all of your life.
If you run out now, it'll be the hardest, most painful thing in the...
To what? To try to remember something
I don't want to remember?
Joe.
What's the matter?
Chris?
I'm sure
I just saw Hansel.
Charlie.
He's clean.
Paul Sand, all right.
Is that your real name?
- Yes, sir.
- Why did you keep your romance with Sugar such a big secret?
- There was no romance.
- Okay, your friendship.
I couldn't risk my position at the library.
My relationship with her was strictly business.
No one would believe that.
So I concealed my activities.
She understood and cooperated.
How did you meet her?
She came in for a book on Japan.
She had an idea about performing in a kimono, and I gave her a few suggestions.
So the act was your idea?
Yes, sir. I suggested that she stage it in a geisha house and incorporate the karate and samurai characters.
I offered to find these types for her, and she paid me for my services.
So why did you kill her?
Look, Mr. Sand. Why don't you make things easier on yourself and tell us what happened?
Now, she was a gorgeous woman.
Anybody'd understand why you'd make a play for her.
Now, what happened?
Did she laugh in your face?
Is that what made you shoot her?
Because you couldn't touch her?
What was the name of that wigmaker that gave an assist on this kimono act?
- No one helped me.
- Mr. Sand, when you warned this young lady on the phone, who took a shot at her?
Paul, come with me.
Get an ambulance, will you?
Paul was mine before she came into his life.
I was sure she took him from me.
That's why I went to see her act.
Saw her take her clothes off in front of all those people.
I died when
I saw her figure.
That's why I killed her.
But I was wrong.
I was so wrong.
He never looked at her.
He'd never even laid a finger on her.
It was all in my mind.
I thought I repulsed him.
You know what I mean.
The way she looked, me.
I was so ashamed, so jealous.
Please, dear God, forgive me.
Forgive me, I...
No, no. I didn't...
I didn't...
- Charlie. Did you get her?
- Yup.
- Dead?
- Nope.
- She killed Sugar.
- Why?
The poor kid. She thought Hansel dumped her for Sugar.
That's why she killed her.
It was all in her mind.
She thought she made him sick...
She only saw in his face what she wanted to.
I don't know how to tell you now how I feel.
You don't have to.
It's all over your face.
How could I have jumped the gun like that? How?
Because you're a meathead, that's how.
Charlie.
- Are we still partners?
- Nope.
It's gonna be rough.
As far as Chris is concerned, it'll always be rough for me.
But as for you and me, Joe, you know, I'm just as glad as you are that you finally wrapped up your own case.
Joe!
Joe!
Hey, Sergeant.
- Rough.
- Uh-huh.
Come on, Charles, let's belt a few.
Mac, you're a pearl.
Thank you, dear boy, but I prefer something made by man to something made by an oyster.
Where is Polly Cameron's room?
- I'm sorry, sir. No visitors are allowed.
- I'm her uncle.
Don't touch my feet! Please!
She's in room 362.
Don't touch my feet!
Cam!
- It's awful. She's in such terrible pain.
- What's wrong with her?
They don't know yet. Dr. Stevenson, this is my brother-in-law, Whitney Cameron.
How do you do, Doctor?
I'm calling in a specialist, Mrs.
Cameron. It looks like tetany.
Mrs. Cameron, I think our worries are over.
- Oh, thank heaven.
- She was a mighty sick girl.
We're very fortunate.
- You still don't know what was wrong?
- Not for sure.
The tetany test was negative.
You know how grateful I am, Doctor.
I've got to call Doug.
Better phone outside.
Besides, I need a smoke.
Cam, now that you're here, how about spending a few days with us?
I'd really like to, Lynne, but I should get back tomorrow.
We're opening a new field in Venezuela.
You're always roaming all over the world.
Did it ever occur to you that we might like to see you once in a while?
It's important for the kids.
- I should spend more time with them.
- You should.
Especially Doug. He never quite got over his father's death.
I know. Hit him pretty hard.
He's at an age now when a boy needs a father.
You're the closest answer to that.
Let me see what I can do. Maybe
I can stay over for a few days.
- I dropped everything to get down here.
- And I deeply appreciate it.
I didn't mean that. Here's your phone.
It's just that I must find a public stenographer and get some letters off.
- All right. You run along, and we'll expect you for dinner.
- Okay.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Chance.
Eh... Uh... oh.
Go to jail.
That's too bad, Uncle Cam.
I know a young man who's got to go hopping right off to bed.
- Can't we play a little longer?
- It's way past your bedtime now, and tomorrow's a school day.
- But Uncle Cam's only going to be here a few more days.
- We're going to have fun too.
- How about our taking in the ice show tomorrow?
- Oh, boy! That's super!
- I'll pick you up at school.
- Gosh, I wish Polly could go too.
It was awful last night, the way she kept yelling, "Don't touch my feet!"
Yes, I know. I heard her.
But I think we should try to get that out of our minds.
- Dad was just like that when he died.
- What do you mean?
I think Doug's letting his imagination run away with him.
But his feet were turned in like hers, and he was all stiff and funny too.
- He was?
- Sure, same as Polly.
Is that right?
Well, there was some similarity, I suppose.
But the doctors all agreed
Bill had virus encephalitis.
- Anyway, there must be a lot of things with those same symptoms.
- I suppose so.
- Did you tell your Uncle Cam about your baseball team?
- Boy, have we got a team.
I knocked two home runs so far.
Course, our field's not very big.
If we were only up in Boston, we could see a lot of the Red Sox together.
- Say, how about letting Doug spend the summer with me?
- Oh, would you, Lynne?
Why not? Sounds wonderful.
- Swell!
- Well, that's settled.
I've got an old sailboat. We could have a lot of fun on weekends.
Lynne took us to Lake George last summer.
- I learned a lot about boats.
- He's quite a sailor.
- Seems to me Lynne's been mighty good to you.
- She sure has.
- Night, boy.
- Night, Uncle Cam.
- Night, Lynne.
- Good night, Doug.
You know, you've been wonderful, the way you took on the job of bringing up those kids.
They're nice kids. It wasn't hard.
When their mother died, I thought no one would ever be able to take her place.
They really love you, Lynne.
I don't see how they could help it.
I always thought Bill was a lucky man.
Now I'm beginning to realize just how I...
Excuse me.
Hello?
Yes.
Yes. We'll be right there.
It's Polly. She's had a relapse.
Cam! When did you hit town?
- Hello, Fred.
- We haven't seen you in ages.
Have you had breakfast?
Fred, Polly's dead.
Dead?
- Maggie? Maggie!
- Yeah? Yeah?
- Hi, Cam.
- Hello, Maggie.
- Polly Cameron died.
- She what?
I just can't believe it.
- Oh, the poor kid. When did it happen?
- About 3:00 this morning.
Oh, what a terrible shock for little Doug. How's he taking it?
Well, they're both under sedatives.
Oh, please go ahead with your breakfast.
I'll get another cup.
What was wrong with Polly?
Well, the doctor seemed rather uncertain.
- He didn't know?
- I suppose it's sometimes hard to tell.
- But there's one thing about it that bothers me.
- What's that?
- Apparently, Polly and her father had the same kind of convulsions.
- They did?
Polly kept screaming, "Don't touch my feet!"
- "Don't touch my feet"?
- Yes.
Why?
Just that it's a curious thing to say.
I'm afraid there might be something hereditary in this thing that could hit Doug.
- Did you ask the doctor?
- Said it wasn't possible.
Just the same, it seems odd. Very odd.
- You weren't here when your brother died, were you?
- No.
- What did the doctor say he died from?
- Virus encephalitis.
That's some sort of sleeping sickness.
And yet in Polly's case they don't know?
Somehow, back in my mind... that "don't touch my feet" rings a bell.
Here we go again. Another wild goose chase.
Maggie still writes for the pulps, and her imagination...
I was checking several years ago, doing research on a story.
There was one case I re...
- What's the matter?
- Nothing. Forget it.
If you've got something on your mind, spill it.
- I'm just a screwball, I guess.
- What were you going to say?
- Well...
- Well?
Okay. It was a murder case I looked up.
The victim had the same kind of convulsions... and kept screaming, "Don't touch my hands!"
- So?
- So, he died of strychnine poisoning.
Oh, man alive, Maggie.
Are you trying to say that Polly and her father might have been poisoned?
This isn't one of your yarns.
You're dealing with real people.
Well, I only mean...
There is a similarity.
Don't try to tell us the doctors wouldn't have recognized strychnine.
They didn't in the case I looked up.
And they apparently don't know what killed Polly.
Let's see what the encyclopedia says about convulsions.
- Why do you always have to dramatize everything?
- You are going off the deep end.
She sees a man take a pocketknife out to sharpen a pencil... and right away builds herself a murder case.
Don't both of you jump on me. I only mention it as something that should be looked into.
Well, they list eight causes.
Tetanus would have required a cut.
Obviously it wasn't rabies.
- Epilepsy?
- No history of it in the family.
- How about tetany?
- Not according to Dr. Stevenson.
With all these others, like brain tumor, there would've been early indications.
You know, there's one thing it'd be pretty tough to rule out.
- What?
- Strychnine.
Strychnine? Are you serious, Mrs. Sargent?
Well, you do admit you don't know what she died from... and strychnine would produce the same symptoms.
- Is this your idea too, Mr. Cameron?
- I don't know, Doctor.
There are so many confusing facts.
You told me it wasn't tetany, yet that's what was put on the death certificate. Why?
Because that's what we were treating the patient for.
She responded to the calcium treatments, so we continued it.
As a matter of fact, I suggested an autopsy.
- Why didn't you have one?
- Because Lynne couldn't stand the idea.
- I see.
- I agreed with her.
Nothing could be gained by it.
Let me ask you one question. Just how do you think the child got the poison?
Well, I don't know, but I don't see how it could have been an accident.
I'm afraid I don't want any part of this, Mr. Cameron.
All right. All right. I'm sorry
I brought it up. Shall we go?
It's preposterous to assume that anyone would have wanted to poison the child.
- Oh, I don't know.
- Okay, then, who could have done it?
- Mmm, several people.
- For instance?
For instance, Lynne. Good day, Doctor.
Maggie!
What on earth got into you making a crazy crack like that about Lynne?
- You can get into trouble.
- Now I'm getting mad.
I only said it was possible, and it is.
- Why don't you like Lynne?
- I can take her or leave her.
Aw, come on, Maggie.
You've got her all wrong.
She certainly made Bill a good wife. He was very happy with her.
Maybe so.
- What time's the funeral tomorrow?
- Do you plan to stay on afterwards?
- Till the end of the week.
Well, that'll at least give me a few more days. Bye-bye.
The more I was with Lynne...
the more I realized what a fine, wonderful person she really was.
Must you really leave tomorrow?
I've stretched it as long as I could.
It's been over a week, you know.
- Yes, I know.
- I'll be back as soon as I can.
- You can rely on that.
- Good.
Lynne's warmth and affection for Doug...
helped so much to soften the blow ofhis sister's death.
Never did Maggie's absurd suspicions...
seem more fantastic than now.
Mr. Sargent wants you on the phone.
Tell him I'll call him back later, please.
- No, go on, Cam.
- I'll take it.
Excuse me.
- Fred?
- You still leaving tomorrow morning?
Yes, of course. 7:15 plane.
Can you possibly stay over?
There's something we ought to tell you.
Maggie's been pestering me about it.
- I don't see how I can, Fred.
- Go on!
- Well, I... I kinda hesitate bringing it up on the phone.
- What is it?
- You know I handled your brother's estate. - Mm-hmm.
Under the terms of the will,
Lynne's share was left in trust.
She receives merely the interest, unless...
Unless?
- Now, I don't want you to think we're jumping to conclusions.
- Well, unless what?
Unless both children were to die. Both Polly and Doug.
- What the devil are you trying to say?
- It could prove a motive.
I'm amazed at you.
Why, the idea's ridiculous.
I know it sounds that way... but I think you ought to stay over another day so we can talk it over.
- For one reason...
- One reason?
Remember, for Lynne to get the money it requires the deaths of both children.
All right.
I'll see you in the morning.
Beautiful.
- That was lovely.
- Thank you.
By the way, uh, I've decided to stay over another day or so, if it's all right with you.
- You know it is.
- That's great, Uncle Cam!
Well, now that your Uncle Cam is going to be here tomorrow, how about you getting to bed?
Sleep late tomorrow too. You've been looking a little peaked.
Oh, I'm all right. I'm feeling fine.
- Soon as you get in your pajamas,
I'll come up and say good night.
- Don't forget!
I've been worried about
Doug. He doesn't look well.
Naturally. Polly's death was a big shock.
No, I mean for some time.
- I'm thinking seriously of taking him to Europe.
- Why?
He needs a change.
Too many things here remind him of his father and Polly.
- Be good for me too.
- How long will you be away?
- Oh, I don't know. Maybe a year or more.
- Oh.
That long?
I thought it'd be fun visiting all the little out-of-the-way places... just taking it easy.
I don't care how it adds up.
Absolutely nothing would ever convince me that a woman like Lynne is capable of murder.
Relax, Cam, relax. We're only talking among ourselves.
But we can't close our eyes to the fact that she did have a motive.
- Over a million dollars' worth.
- Or that she's taking Doug to Europe.
And to out-of-the-way places.
I've gone through every book on poison cases I can find.
There were plenty of women just like Lynne who were poison murderers.
There was Madeleine Smith, Mrs. Maybrick, Lydia
Trueblood and all these dozens of others... many of whom were young, beautiful, intelligent and cultured.
Maybe so, but if it were strychnine that killed Polly... why didn't the doctors recognize it?
Because they weren't looking for it.
Here's the dope on all the famous poison cases.
Lamson, Crippen, Seddon, the works.
Not in one instance did a doctor call the turn... purely on his medical diagnosis.
- This is impressive.
- Let me see.
Look. Over 100 people killed by an arsenic ring in Philadelphia... before even one of the cases was suspected.
Yet that's the only case reported in
Philadelphia during the last 20 years.
How do you account for that?
Because there's so many diseases that simulate poison symptoms.
And the idea of murder seems so utterly incredible to the doctors... that it doesn't even enter their heads.
But this just doesn't make sense.
If Lynne really were guilty, she'd have had Polly's body cremated.
Lynne did want Polly cremated.
I talked her out of it.
Bill wouldn't have wanted it.
I don't see how we can avoid the issue. Polly could have been poisoned.
There's no proof to the contrary, and Lynne could've done it.
We can't dismiss this lightly, Cam.
If... And there is that if... Doug should be murdered, we'd never forgive ourselves.
- Fred's right.
- What do you suggest?
There's only one thing to do. We'll have to try to get a court order for an autopsy.
Oh.
I know how you feel, but we've just got to do it.
All right.
Go ahead. Get the court order.
Get it over with.
Bacardi tonight, Cam, or would you rather have a highball?
- Bacardi's fine. Thank you.
- Ginger ale, Doug?
Thank you.
- Anna will answer it.
- Of course.
I can't figure out where this piece goes.
- It doesn't seem to fit under there.
- Let's see.
Well, what do the plans say?
- Was that for me, Anna?
- Yes, Mr. Cameron.
Thank you. Excuse me.
- Hello.
- Here it is, Cam.
The kid had enough strychnine in her to kill four people.
- Oh, no.
- The D.A.'s pretty sure it must have been murder.
- I told Cole we'd meet him in his office at 9:00 tomorrow.
- I see.
He's going to have the servants and
Lynne brought in for questioning.
- Lynne?
- Naturally.
Oh, sure, sure.
- Good-bye.
- Just a minute, Cam.
You'd better break it to Lynne tonight.
Good-bye.
Come on, Cam. What are you daydreaming about?
- What on earth's the matter?
- Nothing. Nothing.
What about this, Uncle Cam?
Oh, the driving rod?
Well, I suppose that hooks on here with a couple of little pins.
But in the plans it says it goes on with screws.
Well, let's find the screws.
- Dinner's served.
- Thank you, Anna.
- Lynne, I must talk to you.
- Can't it wait till after dinner?
No, I must talk to you right away. I'm sorry, Doug. Why don't you go in and start.
This is very difficult for me.
Here. Please sit down.
I...
I don't know how to begin.
Lynne, I've just got word Polly was poisoned.
- What?
- It's true.
It just couldn't be.
There must be some mistake.
- I'm afraid not.
- But how?
How could it have happened?
- The police think it was murder.
- The police?
Yes.
It was their medical examiner who performed the autopsy.
They want you and the servants down for questioning tomorrow morning.
I'm bewildered by this whole thing.
What gave them the idea of performing an autopsy?
Well, Dr. Stevenson wasn't certain what caused Polly's death... and there was a reason for thinking it was strychnine... and, well, the symptoms are identical.
You knew about this, Cam?
- Yes.
- And you didn't even mention it to me?
I didn't think they'd find anything wrong.
There was no purpose in upsetting you.
I know it's miserable being dragged down to the police for a lot of stupid questions.
Can't be helped.
But there's one fact we can't get away from.
If Polly was poisoned, somebody did it.
It's up to us to find that somebody.
We're sorry we had to cause you all this trouble.
I wish I could've been more helpful. I just couldn't throw any light on this thing at all.
I know it's been very trying for you, Lynne.
Look, why don't we work together on this?
After all, I am in the best position of anyone to help.
I'd be more than willing to hire private investigators, anything you'd suggest.
- Thanks, Mrs. Cameron. We'll let you know.
- Please do.
- I want to see you and Mr. Sargent a minute.
- Oh.
I'll be along as soon as I can.
- This is Captain Pringle of Homicide.
- How do you do, Captain?
Fellas, this is Whitney Cameron, his attorney, Fred Sargent.
They brought the case to our attention.
- We got nothing of any value from Mrs. Cameron.
- Nor the servants.
She apparently treated the children okay, so there was nothing suspicious there.
- Send in Pierce.
- Didn't have any boyfriends.
Least they didn't know of any.
That, sometimes, is an angle in these cases.
Servants wouldn't buy any suggestion
Mrs. Cameron could be responsible.
That goes for the maid Anna. She worked for the first Mrs. Cameron too.
Mr. Cole.
It seems to boil down to Mrs.
Cameron or one of the three servants.
Looks that way.
They were the only ones in the house at the time the kid took sick.
They had dinner at 7:00.
Polly took sick about 11:30.
No one would admit giving her anything to eat in the meantime.
Certainly, strychnine would have started working in a half hour or so.
- Excuse me.
- That's about it.
- Does Cole mean this is where the case ends?
- No, we're going ahead.
But these poisoning jobs are always dillies.
I'm afraid it's gonna be plenty tough to prove who gave that kid the poison.
So you don't have any false hopes... there have only be two poisoning murder convictions in New York in the last 50 years.
Both based on confessions.
- Maybe she got it accidentally.
- Strychnine?
Oh, Mr. Cameron, I think you ought to know we're having your brother's body exhumed.
If they find he was poisoned too, it'll go a long way toward pinpointing who the murderer is.
Mmm.
Do they have to go through all that kind of mess?
You start on a case, you never know where it's gonna lead.
- You wanna come along to court with me?
- Thanks, no.
Think I'll do a little sleuthing on my own.
Then how about meeting us at the club tonight for dinner?
I'm Whitney Cameron. Where can I find Fred Sargent?
- He left word for you to meet him in the bar.
- Thank you.
- There's a local crowd out there that...
- Where's Maggie?
- I've got to talk to you two.
- Just a minute, Cam.
Joe Cunningham, Whitney Cameron.
- How do you do? Where is she?
- She's around here someplace.
- Excuse me, Joe.
- Excuse me.
- What's up?
- I've just come from the library.
Oh, no. Not you too. It's catching.
I went through those books on toxicology.
I knew Lynne couldn't have done it. Now I can prove it.
- How?
- The only way you can die of strychnine is during a convulsion.
The victim dies of suffocation.
That's all very interesting, but what does it prove? There she is over there.
It proves that somebody gave Polly a second dose in the hospital.
- In the hospital?
- Exactly.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- Maggie, Cam's here.
- Oh, Cam!
- I want you to meet some old friends of ours.
- Not right now, Maggie.
- Excuse me.
- Certainly.
- Something happen?
- Cam thinks Polly got a second dose of poison in the hospital.
Well, the convulsions were all over at 7:00 or 8:00 in the morning.
That means her system must have passed off the effects of the poison by that time.
- Cam's got something.
- How could the convulsions start again nearly 20 hours later?
- I never thought of that.
- Nor did the police, nor anyone else.
Besides, I called the medical examiner, and he had to agree.
Sure. In the strychnine cases we looked up, they either died in a few hours or got well.
This definitely proves one thing.
Lynne is absolutely innocent.
But how could the hospital have given her strychnine? By mistake?
- That doesn't make sense either.
- That's what I intend to find out.
Well, there it is. The only medicines administered were ordinary things.
They'd have been supplied by the hospital pharmacy.
The important point is, what was given Polly the night she died.
Well, let's see.
She took nothing at 9:00.
- At 10:00, an MFT-10 cap was given her.
- What's that?
Calcium chloride pepcin in capsule form.
We'd been giving her other calcium preparations earlier... but they have a disagreeable, chalky taste.
So, at, uh, 6:30 I recommended switching to these.
At 10:30, she was given another capsule.
With no ill effects. That's right.
And there appear to be no more entries until, uh, 11:30.
- And that's when she took the last capsule.
- Yes.
She apparently became nauseated, but didn't lose the medicine.
Half hour later, the convulsions started.
At 2:30, she died.
Well, perhaps the strychnine was in this last capsule.
- But it came direct from the hospital pharmacy.
- Hmm.
- This is very confusing.
- It certainly is.
I'm sorry, but I have an operation scheduled. I'll check with you later.
- I appreciate your help.
- Frankly, though,
I don't know what more I can add.
Oh, uh, where is the hospital pharmacy?
- To the right of the entrance as you leave.
- Thank you.
May I have that chart, please?
- Sorry.
- Thank you.
I'd like to check on a prescription filled for Polly Cameron on April 28.
Room, uh, 362.
- Which one do you want?
- The one issued about 6:30.
Mmm. I don't seem to see it.
6:30? We close at 6:00.
Oh.
Bobbie. This man wants to see you.
Miss Brownell, I'm Whitney
Cameron, Polly Cameron's uncle.
Oh, yes. The little girl who had the convulsions.
- According to the chart, you were on duty the night she died.
- That's right.
Do you recall Dr. Stevenson asking you to fill a prescription about 6:30?
- Hmm. Vaguely.
- Where did you get it filled?
- Well, the pharmacy...
- Oh, the pharmacy was closed at that time.
Oh. Well, I don't recall right off.
Now I remember. I was about to send for it when Mrs. Cameron offered to get it filled.
- Mrs. Cameron?
- Yes, I remember it very clearly now.
- Is that all, sir?
- Yes, thanks.
Would you please see if you can identify the woman who gave you the calcium capsules?
This is it. Mrs. Cameron. She's the one I gave the prescription to.
- How did you happen to ask her to get the medicine?
- I didn't.
The hospital pharmacy was closed, and she offered to get the prescription filled herself.
- She offered?
- Yes.
- Did she bring the medicine down herself?
- She did.
- What time was that?
- Around 7:30.
- Notice if the wrapping had been tampered with?
- Looked all right to me.
- The capsules were in a bottle, of course?
- Yes, sir.
- The bottle was sealed?
- No, it was an ordinary cork.
Then it would have been possible for somebody... to have tampered with the capsules without your knowing about it.
Well, yes, I suppose so.
I'd like you to take a look at the photostatic copies of Polly Cameron's chart.
See if you can verify the notations as to capsules administered.
- May I see the photostats of Polly Cameron's chart?
- Mm-hmm.
Thank you.
Yes, this is right. These are the capsules I gave her.
It was right after the third one that she became ill.
- That's all. Thank you.
- Not at all.
Let's see how Russ is coming with the chauffeur.
Mr. Wheeler claims he left the hospital with Mrs. Cameron a little after 6:30... and drove her to a drugstore.
She gave him a prescription which he went in and had filled.
He then drove her to the hospital. She went in with him.
- What time did you arrive back at the hospital?
- 7:30, or a few minutes earlier.
- Where was the drugstore?
- It was an Apex Pharmacy at Fifth and Grand.
Would you come into my office, please.
How long did it take for you to get the prescription filled?
- I suppose about 10 minutes.
- Then you should have been back before 7:30.
- What held you up?
- Mrs. Cameron stopped off at her apartment for a few minutes.
- Did she say why?
- No.
- How long was she in the apartment?
- Not very long.
Five minutes? Ten minutes? How long?
There was no parking place, so I circled the block a couple of times.
Do you remember if Mrs. Cameron had the bottle with her when she entered the apartment?
- I'm not sure, but she must have.
- Why? - Why?
- Because I saw her put it in her purse.
- You're positive?
- Why, yes.
- I see. Thank you. That's all.
Russ, did Ed question the cook?
- Yes.
- Send him in.
- Are you Anna?
- Yes. Anna Swenson.
Think carefully, Miss Swenson.
On the night Polly Cameron died, what time did Mrs. Cameron return to the apartment?
Well, let me see.
Everything was so upset that day. Nobody was on schedule.
- But I'm pretty sure it was before 7:00.
- What did she say to you?
She just told me Polly was coming on fine and for me to fix the guest room.
- Mr. Whitney Cameron was coming.
- Did she say anything else?
- No, not that I can remember.
- Are you sure, Miss Swenson?
- Yes, sir.
- Do you know if she left again within the next 15-20 minutes?
If she did, I didn't hear her.
I was in the guest room.
- You didn't hear her come back again either?
- No, sir.
I asked the cook the same question... but she was in the kitchen and had no way of knowing.
Okay, that'll be all for the moment. Thank you.
- I think we're ready for Mrs. Cameron now.
- I want you in on this, Ed.
- We're ready for Mrs. Cameron.
- In your office?
- Yes, in my office.
- Yes, sir.
Oh, and send in a stenographer, please. Thank you.
- How do you do?
- Hello.
Mrs. Cameron, please be seated.
Gonna try to be as easy on you as possible, Mrs. Cameron.
Thank you.
- A stenographer will take notes. Do you mind?
- Not at all.
- I want to cooperate as much as I can.
- Good.
At 6:30 on the night your stepdaughter died, you offered to get her prescription filled.
That's quite correct.
Mr. Wheeler stated he drove you to the drugstore where you had him fill the order.
- He then gave you the bottle, which you placed in your purse.
- That's right.
- He then drove you to your apartment?
- Yes.
Just why did you return to your apartment?
- To pick up some things for Polly.
- What things?
Comb, brush, toothpaste... things like that.
The night before, we left in such a rush... there wasn't time to think of anything except getting the child to the hospital.
Why didn't you send your chauffeur for them earlier?
I was too worried to think about them.
- How long did you remain in you apartment?
- Only a few minutes.
- Why did you go to you bedroom first?
- To get the traveling case.
- What exactly did you do while you were in your room?
- I picked up the case and left.
- You're sure. You did nothing else?
- Yes. Nothing.
- Then what?
- I went to Polly's room and packed her things.
- Why didn't your maid help?
- She was getting the guest room ready for my brother-in-law.
Packing the bag for Polly was all you did? You're quite sure?
Quite sure.
- Did you open the bottle of capsules?
- No. Why should I?
- Did you at any time remove them from your purse? - No.
Then you delivered the bag and the medicine to the nurse.
- Is that correct?
- Correct?
- Then you admit giving the medicine to the nurse. - Of course.
You realize the lethal dose was administered at the hospital. That's been proven.
- So I understand.
- I don't think we can get away from it,
Mrs. Cameron.
Your stepdaughter must have been murdered.
And we have to find out who's responsible for the child getting the poison.
The hospital attendants had no motive.
- You and Mr. Cameron were the only visitors.
- That's right.
You and the hospital attendants were always present while he was there.
- I know.
- So that rules him out.
And there was always someone present while I was there.
Nevertheless, the poison was slipped into the calcium capsules... and all the medicine came from the hospital, except the bottle you gave the nurse.
- It was in your possession.
- This gave you the opportunity to poison the capsules.
You're the one person with a motive.
The death of the two children would make you a rich woman. You wanted the child cremated.
You opposed an autopsy, though there was doubt as to the cause of the child's death... and Dr. Stevenson particularly requested it.
It all adds up. You were the only one with the motive and the opportunity.
You... You think I did this thing?
That I killed Polly?
It's beginning to look that way, Mrs. Cameron.
But... I loved the child as if she were my own. I couldn't have done it.
Believe me, Mrs. Cameron... you'll be making it much easier on yourself if you'll just tell us the truth now.
If you kept me here all night, all I could say, over and over, is, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it!
That'll be all for now, Mrs. Cameron.
Just wait in the next room, please.
- They think I did it.
- I know.
It's hard to tell what sort of turn this thing will take.
- If it should go against me, what about Doug?
- Doug?
I may be held over for trial or something.
- From the way they talked, it could happen.
- I suppose so.
Well, if it does, would you take him till it's over?
Of course I will. Here.
I'll take good care of him.
Mr. Cameron, Mr. Cole wants to see you in his office right away.
- Excuse me.
- And will you try not to let him hear about this?
Looks like Mrs. Cameron's it.
She's a cool number. Plenty shrewd.
- D.A. busy?
- He's just coming in.
- Tell him I'm coming up. It's important.
- Yes, sir.
Lew, check the servants. See if Mrs.
Cameron kept her bag in the bedroom closet.
Tell Captain Pringle the results.
Supposing I check with the boys, see if they came up with anything.
Wanna come along, Cameron? It's okay.
Sure.
- How you coming?
- So far, it's a bust.
- No strychnine?
- No strychnine.
These are the calcium capsules. We retrieved them from the hospital.
There were nine left in the bottle. I've already analyzed five. This is the sixth one.
If it turns cloudy when I add this
Myers reagent, it's strychnine.
- Clear.
- Possibly the strychnine was only in one capsule.
It checks. There were 12 altogether.
Kid took the first two all right. Third was it.
Captain Pringle, telephone.
Keep at it.
Captain Pringle speaking. Lew?
Oh? Thanks.
She kept the bag in her closet, all right.
Well, we've drawn nothing but blanks so far.
Here are 632 reports from the drugstores. More are coming in.
If a smart dame like Mrs. Cameron did it, she'd never buy the poison at a drugstore.
Well, widen the circle. Keep at it.
They found Mrs. Cameron's bookstore, but it didn't give us a thing.
- What about the servants?
- Nothing.
We wanted to see if any of them had been boning up on poisons.
- What about the libraries?
- They're being covered.
I just received this report from the Cameron apartment. They checked for rodenticides.
Went all through the medicines.
No trace of strychnine.
You must remember, even if we bring the woman up for preliminary examination...
I'm sure no judge will hold her over for trial.
- But you do believe she's guilty, don't you?
- Certainly.
- Captain Pringle too.
- Who else could have done it?
There's no doubt about it in any of our minds.
It's one thing to believe someone's guilty.
- It's quite another to prove it beyond a reasonable doubt.
- That's a must for conviction.
You just heard Captain Pringle. You're the district attorney. You think she's guilty.
Maybe the jury'll think she's guilty too.
Convictions are obtained on facts, not opinions.
Mrs. Cameron is already planning to take my nephew to Europe.
Ayear, five years from now, he'll suddenly die in some obscure place.
That's an angle.
By the time we hear about it, the kid'll have been cremated.
That's supposition, not evidence. We need more evidence.
There's no chance of winning the case.
There's no sense bringing it into court.
You mean, you base your reputation on winning cases, not on losing them.
- So you play only the sure bets.
- Now, Mr. Henderson meant nothing of the kind.
But if we don't come up with some new evidence, we're dead.
So's the boy.
Don't think for a moment we're not fully aware of the gravity of this situation.
That boy's life is in your hands.
- I don't appreciate you're putting it quite that way.
- There's no other way to put it.
I suppose not.
Anderson speaking.
Okay. Thank you.
That was the medical examiner.
There was no evidence of poison in connection with your brother's death.
That, at least, would have been some help to our case.
That still doesn't alter the situation regarding my nephew.
That's right.
I've got a lot of misgivings about doing this... but under the circumstances
I suppose it has to be done.
Get a complaint and a warrant for the arrest of Mrs. Cameron.
We'll have her brought up for a preliminary hearing.
Remain seated. Come to order.
From the examination of the evidence...
I find some grounds for considering
Mrs. Cameron a likely suspect.
However, the State has failed to offer any tangible proof to sustain its contention...
that Mrs. Cameron put strychnine in a calcium capsule.
Undeniably, Mrs. Cameron had a possible motive for such a crime.
But, as the defense pointed out, she is not the only one.
Mr. Whitney Cameron...
also stood to inherit the fortune, should both the children and Mrs. Cameron die.
The defense has proved...
that Mrs. Cameron is a woman ofhigh repute...
and innumerable witnesses have testified...
that she was an affectionate and indulgent mother to the children.
I find that the prosecution has failed to establish probable cause.
I hereby order the defendant discharged forthwith.
- Look this way, please.
- Mrs. Cameron? Hold it!
I have to get custody of that boy.
- We've only got 15 minutes to catch Judge Adams.
- Well, let's go.
Wait. You can't get out of talking to Lynne. Don't take long.
And don't get her back up, or she may never let you see Doug.
Mrs. Cameron, look this way! Hold it!
- I'm sorry you had to go through all of this.
- It's a relief to have it over.
- How's Doug?
- He's fine. I told him you were in Chicago.
- I'll bring him around in the morning.
- Fine.
Judge Adams will be leaving by 5:00.
- Can't you telephone him, make him stay later?
- Comes 5:00, they blow.
We've got to make it.
- Good night, Judge.
- Good night, Frank.
Judge Adams, just a minute, please.
We've got to talk to you on that custody matter I spoke to you about.
I'm afraid you're late. I'm meeting my wife. We're leaving town over the weekend.
- This'll only take a minute.
- I'm sorry. I just have time to catch my train.
- Couldn't we discuss it on the way to the station?
- That'd be rather irregular.
She intends to murder the boy.
I can't consider the question of Mrs. Cameron's guilt or her intentions toward your nephew.
That's a criminal matter, and the judge has just thrown the case out for lack of evidence.
There must be something we can do.
Your brother's will specifically requested the children be left in her care.
I have to abide by that, unless you can prove she's unfit.
I'm sorry. I've got to hurry.
We'll keep the cab, Judge.
932 Lindhurst.
And I helped your brother with that will.
- It was a death warrant.
- Mmm.
Look, what would happen if I just refused to give Doug back to Lynne?
She'd get a court order, and Doug would be taken forcibly, if necessary.
All you'd end up doing would be to make Lynne hopping mad for no purpose.
Well, we've got to think of something.
But fast. We've only got till tomorrow.
What if Doug and I changed our names and went away to some foreign country... where she'd never find us.
And spend the rest of your life as a fugitive?
Besides, sooner or later she'd catch up with you.
Okay, okay, so it was a crazy idea.
Do you have a better suggestion?
Well, there's one way out. As long as
I'm around, Lynne wouldn't dare harm Doug.
So I'm always around.
- Hello, boy!
- Hi! I'm helping Maggie make a cake.
- Come help us.
- I'm quite a cook myself.
This summer I'll show you how to toss flapjacks over an open fire.
- Hi.
- Hello, Maggie.
Just where would you get the money to go bouncing all over the world after Lynne?
She'd move every day just to throw you off.
And each time she took a powder, how would you find her again? Hire detectives?
- Cam, you're not making sense.
- Making sense?
What does make sense about this whole thing?
The police, the district attorney's staff... practically everybody agrees Lynne is guilty, that she intends poisoning Doug.
Yet all they can do is throw up their hands and offer us their profoundest sympathies.
Take it easy, Cam. Take it easy.
Why can't we think of some legal loophole that'll give us an out?
Well, if there is one,
I just can't think of it.
- Think harder. You're the lawyer.
- Hey.
Just a minute. The only thing that matters is little Doug.
This is no time to be at each other's throats.
I'm sorry, Fred. I'm nearly out of my mind over this thing.
We understand, Cam. I guess we're all pretty jittery.
You two have really been wonderful.
I'm calling recess. How's about some coffee?
Later, perhaps. I'm not very good company right now.
I don't like it, Fred. Looks to me like he's on the verge of cracking up.
Yeah, and the worst of it is, there's no solution.
- Doug! Hello, Cam.
- Good morning.
Oh, Doug, it's good to see you.
- Did you have a good time while I was away?
- Oh, sure!
Uncle Cam and I planned out everything we're going to do this summer.
- I've got a surprise for you.
It's upstairs in your room.
- Bet I know what it is!
Cam, I'm afraid we're going to have to postpone Doug's vacation with you.
- Why?
- Well, remember I told you
I was planning a trip to Europe?
- You're taking him to Europe?
- I've got to get away from all this unpleasantness.
You can understand that, can't you?
- It's all been such a nightmare.
- Yeah.
- I figured now is as good a time as any for the trip to Europe.
- When are you leaving?
- Tomorrow, on the Victoria.
- That soon?
We'll probably be gone for about a year.
I've got quite an itinerary planned.
I figure maybe we can spend a week or so in England, and then...
It's got a little honey in it to attract the ants.
- I warn folks with children to be careful of it.
- I'll take it.
Thanks. That'll be 85 cents.
Funny. We've got lots of insecticides today that don't hurt humans.
- But people still mostly go for these old standbys.
- You certainly carry a variety.
We got stuff strong enough to kill a tree.
Worst of it is, it remains in the ground for 50 years or more.
- Suppose a kid or a dog gets some of the dirt in its mouth.
- It'd kill 'em dead.
- What are these?
- Innocent lookin', aren't they?
Strongest stuff we carry. Rodenticide.
- Put out by a Midwestern concern.
- Strychnine?
Yeah. There's enough there to kill a horse.
- Hmm.
- Come back again.
- Good evening. This way, please.
- Thank you.
There's Uncle Cam!
- Hello, Doug.
- What are you doing here, Uncle Cam?
I just decided to take a little cruise myself. Have a seat.
Won't you join us?
Gee, Lynne, Uncle Cam's coming with us!
- Surprised?
- Surprised.
- I decided to come along.
- I gathered as much.
- Just one of those things.
- That explains everything.
I mean, I... sort of acted on impulse.
Spur of the moment sort of idea.
- You're making it very difficult.
- I'm so sorry.
- Well, the firm had me down for a trip to Europe...
- I thought it was Venezuela.
I felt now was as good a time as any to take it.
And that this ship was as good as any to take it on. How cozy.
And now the real reason.
You don't believe me, do you?
- No.
- Cocktail, sir?
Bacardis?
Bacardis.
Maybe if we play our cards right, they'll let us look at the radar stuff up there too.
- Night, boy.
- Hurry up, darling.
Get into your pajamas. It's late.
- Night, Uncle Cam. See you tomorrow.
- Good night.
- Good night, Cam.
- How about once around the deck?
Fine, but come in and wait till I get Doug tucked in.
Now the real reason, hmm?
- I guess you're entitled to it.
- I think so.
Standing by while you went through this horrible ordeal... was as miserable for me as it was for you.
I wanted you to know that.
You came on this trip just to tell me that?
It wasn't one of those things you could say in one night... while someone was packing trunks... not if you wanted to sound convincing.
Still not convinced?
You're a hard woman.
When did you first get the notion to come along?
When you first told me you were going to Europe.
Why then?
Because that was the moment when
I realized how much I'd miss you.
How very much.
Lynne played right into my hands.
My plan couldn't have been working more smoothly.
The one who came nearest to guessing the ship's mileage each day won a prize.
I got a kick out of Doug's excitement when he found he'd won.
Yes, it could have been a wonderful trip...
if only the circumstances had been different.
But there were moments when I was horrified by the enormity of my plan.
Cold fear would come over me.
There were those fearful moments of doubt when I would speculate on the possibilities...
of Lynne not being guilty at all.
But always my mind would come back to the irreconcilable fact: Polly was murdered.
Somebody did it, and all the evidence pointed to that somebody being Lynne.
Tonight was my last night at sea.
My time had finally run out.
- At last.
- Sorry I'm late. Am I forgiven?
Forgiven. But let's hurry.
- You look wonderful tonight.
- Thank you.
For heaven sakes, will you go in and say good night to Doug?
He refuses to go to sleep until you do.
This was the moment I'd planned on.
There might not be another.
How about cocktails before we go?
Oh, but we don't want to be too late.
The captain's ball is so much fun.
- I could phone the bar.
They could have them here...
- Never mind.
- I'll do it to save time.
- Yes.
- I didn't think you were ever coming, Uncle Cam.
- I wouldn't desert you, Doug.
- Can't you stay with us in England?
- I'd like to.
- I'm afraid I can't.
- When will I see you again?
Well, I don't know.
Maybe I'll get a chance to fly over in the next couple of months.
- Doesn't take long on a plane, you know.
- Will you?
Sure. You'll have a wonderful time in Europe.
Lynne tells me she's taking you to Paris... and Switzerland this winter for the skiing.
- You'll like that, won't you?
- If only you could come too, Uncle Cam.
Don't you worry about that. I'll see you in the morning before we dock.
- Good night, Uncle Cam.
- Yeah.
I'll see you before we dock.
- Night, boy.
- Night, Uncle Cam.
The moment had arrived... the moment I dreaded.
But I had to appear at ease, though my mind was numb.
Come in.
Ah. Set them right down here.
I'd rehearsed this scene a thousand times in my mind.
But now that it was a reality...
the idea of taking the life of a human being...
seemed like a hideous nightmare.
Thank you, sir.
Lynne, uh... remember our first meeting?
- It was at a cocktail party, wasn't it?
- Yes, given for my brother.
It was a couple of days before you two were married.
I wished I'd met you first.
I thought you were the most beautiful woman I'd ever seen.
- Oh!
- Sorry.
- It's all right.
- Excuse me.
I can get it off in a jiffy.
I tried to pour the bottle, but my hand wouldn't move.
It were as if it belonged to someone else.
I'd have to find another chance later...
later tonight.
Well, that was simple.
It doesn't even show.
Good.
It's stuffy in here.
Suppose by some freak chance I was wrong?
But Fred agreed, Maggie, the D.A., the police... All of them agreed.
Only she could have done it.
If I couldjust be certain.
- Oh, no.
- "No" what?
- Can't you hear?
- Hear?
"Auld Lang Syne," silly. It means the end of the dance.
And the end of the voyage.
It's been a wonderful voyage.
What if I didn't have the nerve to go through with it and Doug died...
died because Lynne had murdered him?
I'd exhausted every other out.
I knew it had to be done tonight.
But I had to stall for time... time to get up my courage.
Mmm.
How 'bout a turn around the deck?
Oh, nice, except it's getting a little chilly.
That's easy. Give me your key. I'll get your coat.
Be right back.
Somehow or other I sensed a vague association...
between these bottles...
and the fact that I had used my shaving... lotion bottle...
as a place to hide my poison.
What if Lynne had reasoned the same way?
I couldn't help but notice the striking similarity between the aspirin...
and those rodenticide pills
I'd seen in the nursery.
Then I found it... one different from the others.
A "W"... A "W", the same marking that was on the strychnine tablet...
enough to kill a horse.
There were three in all.
This was the proof I needed.
Now more than ever, I knew I had to go through with my plan.
Well, I think it's time we called it a night.
This is the last night we'll be alone for a long time.
- How about a good-night drink?
- Why not?
Hello. Give me the bar, please.
Hello. This is cabin 92-A.
May we have two Bacardi cocktails, please?
Thank you.
Cam.
You've been so sweet to us on this trip. It's been a wonderful crossing.
- I'm sorry it's over.
- Are you really?
Mm-hmm.
Tell me something, and I want the truth now.
- Why did you really come on this trip?
- You know why.
I know the reason you gave me.
It was all very flattering, but rather difficult to believe.
You don't believe it?
I don't know.
But you are the sort of man who might do crazy, impulsive things.
You mean, like taking this ship so I could be with you for five more days?
Yes.
Oh, I'll...
I'll take these.
- There you are.
- Thank you, sir.
This was my last, my very last chance.
Here.
Thanks.
Mmm.
- Your hand's trembling.
- Oh.
What's the matter with you, Cam?
It's a little warm in here.
Why don't you open the porthole?
- Do you mind?
- No.
- Oh, that's much better.
- Yes.
Yes, it is, isn't it?
Cam, something is wrong.
No, no. I'm all right.
It's bitter.
Mine too, but... I suppose we're lucky to get anything at all at this hour.
- Lynne.
- Yes?
- I found a bottle of aspirin in your stateroom.
- So?
Three of the tablets were different from the others. They had a "W" on them... trademark of a tablet containing strychnine.
Oh, for heaven's sakes, Cam, not that again.
They also happen to be aspirin pills.
Why were they different from the others?
Because they were another brand. But
I refuse to go through all this again.
- Yet they were in the same bottle?
- Well, why not?
I'd been taking another type of aspirin. I had a few left over.
I put them in the new bottle to save some room. Is that so peculiar?
Lynne, the "W" is the trademark of an insecticide manufacturer, not a pharmaceutical house.
So that's the real reason you came on this trip.
You were behind this ridiculous persecution from the first.
- You say they were harmless aspirin pills.
- Of course.
- You absolutely sure?
- Absolutely.
That's good. I'm relieved.
- I'm very relieved.
- Why?
Because one of the "W" pills was dissolved in your drink. You've just taken it.
I don't think you and
I have anything more to discuss... ever.
Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to bed.
Who are you?
I'm Frank Connelly, ship's detective. Mr. Cameron sent for me.
As a witness.
A witness?
So that's what you expected... an hysterical admission that the pill contained strychnine.
You never give up, do you, Cam?
But this time I'm afraid you drew another blank.
The tablet was harmless.
There seems to have been an unfortunate mistake.
I suggest we forget the whole thing.
I'll go along. Will you excuse me?
Of course. I'm sorry about it too.
But this sort of thing is getting to be a habit with Mr. Cameron.
Wait a minute.
Come back, please.
Look.
It's been over five minutes since you took that drink.
Right now your life can be saved... even in another five minutes.
But beyond that you're getting into a dangerous zone.
You're well versed on the subject of strychnine, aren't you, Cam?
Oh, Lynne, please, please!
If there was strychnine in that tablet, call the doctor now before it's too late!
On the other hand, if the tablet with the "W" on it was merely an aspirin... there wouldn't be much sense in calling a doctor, would there?
And if I were to admit that it did contain strychnine... there still wouldn't be any sense in my phoning for a doctor.
Sort of an even stephen trade... death by strychnine or death by the electric chair.
Take your choice.
Look at this clock.
It's five minutes past 1:00.
Every time it ticks it brings you a second nearer a horrible death right here and now!
You're being a fool, Lynne, an absolute fool!
Strange, isn't it? You seem to be the one who's unnerved, not I.
You know, it just occurred to me, if there was strychnine in that tablet... and I should die, you're the one who'll be facing the electric chair.
Or hadn't you thought of that?
You're all confused, aren't you, Cam?
You don't know, not for sure, whether I'm lying or not.
And if I am, you yourself will be a murderer.
Hmm, you don't like the idea of that, do you?
It takes nerve to kill someone... sit by and watch them die.
How would you like to have a death on your conscience...
My death?
Oh, yes, it was five after 1:00, wasn't it?
Nearly a minute's gone by since then.
This is too much for me. Did you or did you not give this woman strychnine?
I gave her a pill marked with a "W" that I took from her aspirin bottle.
Then it was completely harmless, and you have nothing to worry about, either of you.
Here.
- Tell me, Mr... Mr...
- Connelly.
Oh, yes, Mr. Connelly.
What are your impressions of the man there in that chair?
From his looks, would you say he had character?
Honor? Integrity?
Well, I'm sure you would.
But I'm afraid he's quite deceiving.
Let me tell you about him, Mr. Connelly.
He lived in my apartment as a guest...
as a relative, as a warm friend.
But all the while he was accepting my hospitality, Mr. Connelly... what do you think he was doing behind my back?
He was taking everything I said, every incident that occurred... and was conniving to build a case against me.
But his betrayal didn't end there.
Even after the court laughed at his ridiculous charges... he kept on and on with his persecution!
But this last attempt...
This is the most contemptible of all!
Tonight...
Tonight you must really be proud of...
Even while we were dancing in each other's arms... even while you were making love to me... you were all the while plotting to take my life.
How treacherous...
How despicably treacherous is it possible for a man to get?
Look at the clock, Whitney Cameron.
The five minute deadline you gave me has passed... and nothing's happened to me.
How about that, Cam?
Even you ought to be convinced by now.
You're being an idiot... a complete idiot!
You were there with me when
Polly died. You heard her screams.
You saw the horrible convulsions and the agony she went through.
Do you think that I, that anyone who had seen that... would take a chance of dying in the same horrible way?
Do you?
I've been a bigger fool than you.
You took me in completely.
I was even falling in love with you.
This farce has gone on long enough.
Now get out of here, both of you! Get out!
Get out, or I'll call the purser!
I assure you, Mr. Cameron will leave at once.
This is the most outrageous thing I've ever witnessed.
- You realize I'll have to make a full report of this.
- I suppose so.
I must have been insane...
Stupidly, blindly insane.
How could I have been so wrong?
Apparently, Polly's death was due to one of those impossible accidents...
that couldn't happen but did.
A million-to-one shot.
A mistake by a careless drug clerk.
I was horror-stricken at the thought that...
it was only by the merest chance that I hadn't murdered her.
What a mess. What a complete, miserable mess I'd made of everything.
Mr. Cameron. You're wanted in the surgeon's office right away.
Mr. Cameron is here.
It's Mrs. Cameron. We were just able to save her life.
Another minute and it would've been too late.
She phoned here as soon as we left.
On October 10, 1952...
Lynne Cameron was convicted of murder in the first degree.
Her sentence: life imprisonment.
And so to the names of Madeleine
Smith, Florence Maybrick...
Lydia Trueblood and all those other young, beautiful...
but evil poison murderers...
was added that of Lynne Cameron.
Get up. Get up!
Jennie?
- Mr David Graham?
- Yes.
I'm Jeremy Clayton.
Your son's lawyer.
Would all the passengers for the 6am plane to Stockholm
please report to the main departure hall.
I couldn't come sooner.
- Is it tomorrow?
- Yes.
What time?
The execution is ordered for tomorrow morning, at eight o'clock.
I have my car.
- Is that all your luggage, sir?
- Yes.
Passengers for the 6am plane to Stockholm,
please report to the main departure hall.
- What happened?
- Hmm?
Tell me, what happened?
I brought the transcript of the trial for you.
I... I shan't be able to read all that. I'll try later.
Tell me about it now.
On the night of the murder, your son, Alec, called for Jennie Cole.
- She is, of course, the...
- The murdered girl, yes.
The two of them went to the Stanford flat, that had been lent to Alec by Robert Stanford for the weekend.
- Stanford?
- The Stanford car people. The East Enders.
In the morning, the girl was found dead.
Your son was picked up, dazed and distracted, hardly knowing where he was, or what had happened.
He'd been drinking.
And he was charged with the murder.
He's innocent.
I know he's innocent.
The case against him legally is overwhelming.
Then it's legally overwhelming against an innocent man.
The prisoner's name is Alec Graham.
It's all been arranged.
There should be a permit waiting for us here.
And, er... he is?
The prisoner's father.
Mr Graham?
I thought I ought to have a word with you before you go in.
These last twenty-four hours can be a hell, only your son has adjusted himself. He's...
He's built a protective shell round himself, and we all feel here that it's a great blessing.
It's our job to protect the prisoner as much as possible, and, if we thought a visit was disturbing to him, we'd be forced to cut that visit short.
If you'll follow him, this officer will take you across.
Oh, Mr Graham, will you leave your bag here, please?
Would you rather
I waited for you here?
I think you'll find the boy has been well looked after, sir.
Alec?
I'm sorry I didn't come sooner.
Forgive me, I...
Well, you see, I...
I didn't know.
Can you hear me?
I was moving about.
I was travelling all the time.
This advance that my publishers gave me...
I'd started to work on a new novel that I'd set in Canada...
You were working on one of your longer drunks.
You were in a sanatorium.
The prosecution brought it up.
Maybe they thought it would be good for their case, I suppose.
Drunken father, bad blood.
I came as soon as I could, Alec.
You're drunk now.
Oh, no! No, I haven't had a drink for a long time.
It was just that I couldn't get here sooner.
I... I'd been very sick.
Even before this happened, you hadn't written for months.
I know, I...
I'm sorry. Forgive me.
But it didn't matter.
Somehow, we always knew that we were together, you and I.
You remember.
I remember every letter you did write.
Every word.
And those frightening boarding schools you put me in.
And the weeks, months, that would go by without seeing you.
And then you'd show up with a silly little gift of atonement in your pocket.
I'm here now, Alec.
That's the important thing.
Each time, you'd seem to me so handsome, so charming,
I was glad to forgive you.
I'd forgive you anything.
But not this time, David.
You left me alone.
I couldn't help it, Alec.
Doesn't matter.
Nothing really matters.
Besides, I... understand now about Mother.
You just made use of me to get her back.
Look, Alec, we haven't got time to go into all that.
Tell me, what... what happened?
I know you didn't do this.
- No, I don't want to talk about it.
- Don't...
- But you've got to let me help you!
- No!
I'm going to die in a few hours, and it'll be over.
It's too awful when you think there's hope. I...
I went through it once.
I'm not going through it again.
But you're letting them.
You're not even trying to help yourself.
But why?
Why should I wait until I turn into something like you?
- Oh, no, that's...
- Long before this happened,
I'd started to drink.
What?
You've got to let me help you.
Please!
Alec?
Alec!
Well, there must be something I can do.
I'll study the transcript.
I'll get more time. Only...
- Only you mustn't give up!
- Why not?
What difference would it have made if you had died when you were my age?
Alec...
Alec!
What are you trying to do?
I mustn't even smell a drink.
What are you thinking, that one drink won't make any difference?
You're wrong, you know, you're wrong, but...
There's something wrong here.
There's something that's been overlooked.
I've put all the skill, all the knowledge of twenty years of the law into this,
- and I've found nothing.
- Well, you're wrong, you're wrong.
All right, then, Graham, face the facts.
Alec was insanely in love with this girl. He admitted it.
That night, she told him they were finished, it was over.
They were seen quarrelling violently in a public place.
Oh, he's innocent!
There were signs of a violent quarrel at the flat.
Alec's face was scratched.
He admits having fought with her.
- No.
- He...
No, not Alec.
Alec's gentle, like his mother.
He lied to me.
He told me she was so drunk he had to leave her at the flat.
The postmortem showed no trace of alcohol in the girl's blood.
Why should he lie to you?
Clayton... you believe he's innocent, don't you?
- Well...
- Oh, stop acting like a lawyer, man!
Tell me what you... what you believe as a man.
I've fought this with everything I could.
I've had two stays of execution granted, and there's nothing more I can do.
Well, then let me fight.
Get me an appointment with the Home Office.
The Home Office can't grant a third stay unless there's some overwhelming new evidence, or an undeniable doubt.
Somewhere, there must be something that everybody's overlooked.
What about the girl who was murdered?
- Didn't she have any relatives?
- One sister, Agnes Cole.
Before you stir up impossible hopes,
I think you should see her.
You'll find her here, this morning.
And now, ladies and gentlemen, it is my pleasure to introduce the lovely ladies of our show.
First we have lovely Yvonne.
Yvonne is what is known as a tall, willowy blonde.
Sometimes she will away, sometimes she won't.
And here we have Laura.
Laura, now there's the type of girl who won't go anywhere without her mother.
But boy, can her mother go places.
And here's Deirdre, beautiful Deirdre.
She likes the little things in life.
Little Rolls, little mink coat, little diamond ring...
I want to see Agnes Cole.
- What?
- Agnes Cole.
- I'm Agnes Cole.
- Now here come the lovely
dancing ladies of the show!
I'm David Graham,
Alec Graham's father.
♪ Bye bye, boys, that's all for now ♪
Miss Cole, Miss Cole, Miss Cole, please, could I have a word with you?
Your son killed my sister.
You keep away from me!
No, Alec could never have done a thing like that...
How could you know?
You weren't even at the trial.
My sister, Jennie, was a sweet and lovely person before she met Alec.
And then she got so's you wouldn't think she was the same girl.
She'd come home, night after night, drunk!
And then one night she came home,
Christmas Eve it was, too, and I thought she'd had an accident.
She was all bruised, her cheeks were all swollen, and her eye...
Well, then it couldn't have been Alec.
It must have been someone else.
She must have been going with someone else.
- No, only Alec.
- No, it couldn't have been Alec.
- What other man was she seeing?
- No-one.
Why should a chorus girl go out with a penniless boy?
Especially if he were being cruel to her? It doesn't...
Look, please, can't any of you tell me something about Jennie Cole?
- You see, I've got to find out, because...
- What are you doing?
What are you trying to do?
Dirty the memory of my sister?
Let me tell you, Mr Graham.
Your son killed my sister.
And I'm glad he's going to die!
Can I help you, sir?
I want to see Mr Stanford.
Oh, er... come in,
I've been waiting for you.
Mr... Mr Gage.
Dad, this is Mr Gage.
You remember I told you about him?
You told me about Mr Gage?
Yes, I told you about him, he's... he's going to coach me for my Bar exams.
I certainly don't remember you telling me about a tutor.
Oh, Dad, you... you were just too busy being enthusiastic about the new model.
Oh, that's quite possible.
When it comes to sports cars, or any cars for that matter,
I'm not much interested in anything else.
And Brian's no better.
Oh, Mr Gage, this is Mrs Stanford.
How do you do, Mr Gage?
How do you do?
I'm afraid petrol's in our blood.
You see, I started life as a mechanic.
I've never had the time or the money for tutors.
Will you excuse me, Mr Gage?
I'm in rather a hurry.
Do you need Henry to drive you?
Yes, he's taking Brian and I over to the proving grounds.
The Stanford sports prototype's going through its ordeal by fire.
It's a very big moment for all of us.
I'm afraid you'll have to talk about this tutor business some other time.
I'm afraid I've got another appointment.
Dad, I think we'd better get this over with.
We need to talk, Mr Gage and I.
Then he'd better come along.
He can talk in the car.
Well, we'll go up to the flat.
We... We need quiet.
Oh.
Well, perhaps you'd like to come along, Honor?
I'm afraid I can't.
Is something terribly pressing?
You know how I hate being alone, especially when the car's being tested.
I'm sorry, Robert, but at last I've managed to get an appointment with an MP.
How much longer is this going on?
Don't you think you've done enough?
- Well, what is it? Do you think Mr...
- Gage.
Gage, Mr Gage, is the only man in England that doesn't know a murder's been committed?
In our flat?
And by a friend of our son's?
And that he's going to hang tomorrow?
I'm afraid Mrs Stanford's been driving herself unmercifully in an effort to save the poor chap.
I think she's been overdoing it.
Well, now there are no secrets at all!
Are you coming?
No, Robert, I'm not.
Well...
Well, I don't suppose there's any stopping the army of the righteous.
All right, you can take Henry,
I'll drive myself.
Thank you.
Brian, I... I hope you'll be able to work something out with Mr Gage.
Don't worry about me, Honor,
I'll take care of myself.
Yes, of course.
- Goodbye, Mr Gage.
- Goodbye, Mrs Stanford.
Why did you say I was a tutor?
Oh, excuse me, Mr Stanford.
- What do you want, Graham?
- I came to help Alec.
You're a little late, aren't you?
I was in hospital. They wouldn't let me leave till yesterday.
Did you know about Alec?
No, they wouldn't allow me to read my mail.
- None of it?
- None at all. Why?
Why are you so interested in my mail?
How did you know who I was?
I saw your picture in Alec's room.
What, Alec kept my picture?
Yes, when he came to stay at weekends, he always brought your photograph with him.
You're surprised?
Yes.
Oh, he used to talk about you by the hour.
In some ways, it was our favourite topic of conversation.
Neither of us had any parents to speak of.
My real father was killed in the Stanford works.
He was just an ordinary workman.
You didn't really think Honor was my mother, did you?
I'm adopted.
The Stanfords adopted me when I was eight.
What did Alec say about me?
I got the impression you were about to write the greatest novel ever written.
Did you?
In common with quite a lot of other writers,
I've been about to write it for a very long time.
This is where I live. I hope
I'm not taking you out of your way.
You do want to help, don't you?
I'm sorry, Graham, I'm going in.
Alec's your best friend, isn't he?
Well, isn't he?
Yes. Yes, he was.
Well, then, you wouldn't hide anything that might help him.
You still haven't told me why you said I was a tutor.
Well, that was an impulse.
I wanted to help you.
How?
I don't know.
People don't always act logically.
Not everything's thought out.
Is this where it happened?
Yes. It is.
At the trial...
Alec said that he thought he heard a door slam, as though someone had come in by way of the back door.
Was that someone you, Brian?
I was playing poker all night.
Oh, it's all right.
The police checked up.
Hello?
No, no.
But there is a back door?
Mr Brian, I hope you're not expecting lunch.
Cook and the rest were told to take the afternoon off.
Um... hold on a minute.
No, Mrs Johnson, we're not expecting lunch, and you can take the afternoon off, too.
If there's anything
I can do, Mr Brian?
No, no, he's not here now.
All right, I'll tell him you rang.
No, there's nothing, thank you.
Look, you know that if you're hiding anything, you're a murderer.
- I... I am?
- Yes.
You do know something.
Now stop wasting Alec's time!
Well...
It's...
It's about a letter.
What sort of letter?
I... I don't know.
Oh, Brian, please!
We'd been sending you our old magazines.
Alec said you liked the English magazines.
- He was always worrying about you...
- I know all that. Go on.
Well... when one of the servants sent off the last package of magazines, she thought she saw a piece of blue writing paper between the pages of one of them.
No, I don't understand.
Slowly, please.
What makes you think that this piece of blue writing paper was a letter?
- I... I don't know that it was...
- You just said it was a letter!
- Well, I think it was something personal.
- Personal?
- Family, private.
- Private? How?
What makes you think that this letter is so important?
Well, it may not be...
Well, anyway, you should have done something about it.
- The letter was sent to you.
- I couldn't do anything about it.
And you kept silent, all through the trial.
And what did you do all through the trial?
They had to put you in one of those places for alcoholics.
Alec told me about your drinking.
Then you must have known, when those magazines were sent off, that I should never read that letter.
Look, Brian, I'm not a detective, you've got to help me!
Oh!
You see, sometimes... when it's someone one loves, you... well, it would only hurt them.
And it wouldn't help Alec!
Operator?
Yes, I want to call...
I want to call to Canada.
Montreal.
Who is this that you're protecting, Brian? Who is it?
What? Oh, um...
Curzon, 7712.
Hello, hello, are you there, caller?
Hello, hello, are you there, caller?
Hello, hello...?
I want the Morningsign Hospital.
Yes, I know the number.
It's Montreal 14161.
What?
I... I almost rang you myself once or twice.
There's a delay.
Now, operator, please. This is urgent!
It's an emergency, yes.
Yes! Yes, a matter of life and death, that's what I...
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
That's all right.
Well, as quickly as you can, please.
There's no reason not to tell me now, Brian.
Now, is there?
That only leads to our bedrooms.
Look, don't...
That's your room,
I don't think that interests me.
What are you doing?
Trying to find out some of the answers that you won't tell me.
What's in here?
Oh, that's my mother's... that's Honor's room.
Was the letter written on this paper?
- Well, it's a very ordinary kind of paper.
- Yes, but it happens to be blue.
Why does she need a gun?
Well, that's Dad's gun.
I... I don't know how it got here.
- Do you know about these things?
- Yes.
Is that loaded?
Yes, it's fully loaded.
- That's the telephone.
- No, it's the front door.
What do you want?
Is your father in?
No, he's not.
He rang me.
The message said it was urgent, so...
I thought I'd pop in myself.
Well, he's not here.
He did say it was urgent.
All right, you've convinced me.
You're a devoted Stanford employee.
How dare you speak to me like that, Master Brian?
All complaints should be filed through the appropriate channels.
I'll tell him you "popped in".
Please do.
Who was that?
Vickie Harker. Dad's secretary.
Or used to be.
Why does she put on that act?
Well, she goes to the pictures!
Secretaries do, you know.
What have you got against her?
Hello?
It's Montreal!
Hello? Hello?
Give me Dr Pollock, please.
Oh, quickly, it's long distance.
Hello? Hello?
Dad's just driven up!
You'll have to hurry.
Hello, Dr Pollock?
This is Graham.
David Graham.
No, I'm calling you from
London, England.
Are you there?
You have to hurry!
Look, some magazines and newspapers were sent to me.
Well, they should have been kept in my locker with my other mail.
Can you hear me?
Well, look, in one of those magazines was a note written on a piece of blue paper.
Look, it got slipped in with one of the magazines by mistake.
Now listen, you've got to find me that note.
Well, ring me if you find anything.
He's just getting out of the lift.
Oh... Curzon 7712.
Yes, seven, seven, one, two.
Call me the moment you find anything!
Who'll pay for the call?
I'll pay for the call.
Tell him I'll wire him the money.
Stop him at the door.
We'll pay.
We'll wire you the money!
No, I'm quite all right, thank you.
Only, please, please call.
It's my son's life.
Curzon, that's right.
- Can I trust you, Brian?
- Yes. Yes, I promise.
Brian?
Brian?
Brian!
Your name's not Gage!
It's Graham! David Graham!
Alec's father!
My wife just telephoned me.
She's on her way back here.
She thought she recognised you!
Why have you done this?
- I was only trying to help you.
- Help me how?
What's this nonsense about helping?
Well, speak up!
I was going to tell you, but you didn't give me the chance.
Help me, help me?
Well, protect you, then, if you don't like the words I use.
Protect me from what?
What makes you think
I need protection?
I thought there might be some unpleasantness at the office, and...
I thought it'd be better to talk here.
I thought it wouldn't look good for Stanford's.
Ah.
All right, all right.
I suppose you meant well.
But next time, confide in me, Brian.
I'm your father.
Remember that, old lad!
Exactly what did you hope to get from us, Mr Graham?
Help.
Why did you think we could help?
I just came to find out if you could.
I don't think you understand what we've been through, Mr Graham.
I think we're entitled to be left alone.
I'd follow up anything, Mr Stanford.
Anything that offers the slightest hope.
Then you still think there's a hope.
Yes.
Yes, I do.
Then you know something.
No, but I hope to soon.
We befriended your son.
We treated him as if he were one of our own.
To bring that poor girl in here... and murder her...
I'm asking you to leave, Mr Graham!
It's important for me to have access to this flat.
There must be something here that will lead me to the truth.
Mr Graham?
I don't understand why you had to...
We want to do everything we can to help you.
Honor...
- You're to do nothing more.
- We're so distressed.
I want no member of this family to have anything even remotely to do with this case.
I want it forgotten!
Finished!
Your son and mine were just friends at the university.
You can't expect us to do anything more than we've done!
Hello? Yes, Stanford speaking.
No, no tests without me, do you understand?
Well, tell them all to wait till I get there.
No, she's not to be touched until I've ripped her apart myself.
All right.
Miss Vickie Harker called to see you.
It was something to do with the office.
How dare you intrude in this way?
Mr Graham, what can I do to help you?
Why are you doing this to me?
Can't you understand what I'm going through?
I'm sorry.
This thing has affected me more than I thought.
Brian!
I'm going out for a walk.
Would you like to come?
I can't, Dad. I can't leave the flat.
I... I mean, I'd rather not.
What does Vickie Harker mean to this family?
Mr Graham?
If you want to see Miss Harker,
Henry can drive you there.
- Nothing very luxurious, Mr, um...
- Gage.
Gage. Still, it's a cosy little corner, as you might see.
Excuse my hair being so untidy, but I never expected anybody, you see.
- Here you are.
- Oh, thank you.
Look at this.
Recently acquired because of my daughter's latest promotion.
It was your daughter
I was wanting to see, Mrs Harker.
Oh, Vickie's never around at this hour.
- No, I thought, well...
- Here you are, have a drink.
No, thank you.
- Come on, it'll do you good.
- No, no, no, please!
I'll... I'll have a cigarette, if you don't mind.
Oh, come off it.
One old tippler can always smell another a mile away.
You'll never give it up.
We never do.
Why try at your age?
Come on, have a drink.
- No, thank you.
- Come on, drink up!
Now, then, what's all this about?
You needn't be delicate with me,
Mr Gage, I'm a woman who's lived.
I saw you out there in the car, looking very grand.
But it's mostly
Mrs Stanford's car, isn't it?
Yes, that's right.
Yeah, it would be a dark day when
I didn't know where I was going.
What'd she send you for?
Well, there are one or two questions I'd like to ask you.
Well, you tell Mrs Stanford if she wants any evidence for a divorce, she doesn't have to send a detective, she can come around and get it herself.
No, but now that I am here, if I could just ask you whether...
Well, well.
My Vickie was right after all.
Fancy Mrs Stanford giving up a man like Stanford, eh?
And here was I thinking that Vickie was throwing away the best years of her life.
Not that Mr Stanford's mean, you know.
Oh, no.
She's just been given a job at the head of one of his most important agencies.
Yes, I did know that.
Well, it just goes to show you, Mr Gage,
I'm not a very good judge of life, am I?
Do you know what I said to my Vickie when she told me about the promotion?
I said,
"Vickie, my girl, you've had it.
"Absolutely had it."
Farewell gift, bon voyage.
Farewell, my love!
One of the little pleasures in life,
Mr Gage, I can now give myself.
Just to hear it ring, and know that you don't have to go anywhere.
It's wonderful.
Why don't you have another drink?
It might take the tremble out of your hands.
Oh, I haven't much time.
Just tell your lady she's got nothing to worry about.
I'll see my Vickie cooperates!
But she's not to start getting any fancy ideas about alimony, because we're not throwing good money down the drain.
If she starts for asking for any fancy amount, she'd better watch out.
Watch out for what?
Well, you never know, Mr Gage.
Somebody might just mention, just supposing, possibly, about Mrs Stanford and that boy!
What boy?
The boy that's being hung tomorrow.
Alec?
Er... Alec Graham?
My Vickie once said to me,
"I wouldn't be at all surprised if..."
Alec and Mrs Stanford?
Is that what you mean?
Why should Vickie say that?
Tell me.
Who are you?
Why aren't you drinking?
What have you come for?
I don't believe you are a private detec...
- Tell me!
- Oh no!
I'll tell you nothing! Nothing.
No more to say!
Not another word!
I've had a hard life.
Not another word!
Alec and Mrs Stanford, what was it?
Get out!
Get out of here!
- Mrs Harker!
- Get out!
But why should Mrs Stanford have killed this girl?
She was in love with Alec.
She was jealous of the girl.
- No, that's utterly fantastic!
- Well, something utterly fantastic happened.
So fantastic that no-one's thought of it.
Graham, has it ever occurred to you to wonder who was paying my fees?
It's the Stanfords.
They've been paying me.
Oh, well, what does that prove?
Stanford testified they were together that night.
Well, Stanford could be lying, too.
They both lied, one for the other!
Do they strike you as people who have a secret of this kind on their minds?
Everyone has a secret.
It's not always written in the face.
Mr Graham, I'm very sorry, but your son doesn't wish to see you.
The prisoner doesn't wish to see you, sir.
Alec?
I don't believe you.
Look, you think you're protecting him, but...
Mr Graham, I told him that you said it was urgent.
Then go back and tell him that there's still a chance.
Tell him we mustn't give up fighting!
Oh, please!
He told me that he doesn't want another chance.
- Then tell him that...
- He doesn't want to see you, Mr Graham.
Your son has given himself over to other hands.
More compassionate, perhaps, than those of the Earth.
You mean he's given up hope.
Well, I won't have it!
All of you trying to make it look so humane and decent.
You can't.
I want my son to live!
I'm not going to let you kill him.
Mr Maxwell, I don't think you got the point of my last question.
Why have you called a press conference a few hours before Alec Graham is due to be hanged?
And why not?
Every time a particularly sensational execution is about to take place, your campaign for the abolition of capital punishment seems to flare up.
Oh, no.
No, it's just that we get more newspaper attention when there's a legalised killing about to take place.
You see, we feel that the public should know the full horror which happens when the state decides to take the life of a human being.
The cold, calculated planning.
The way the executioner, and his assistant, make sure of the weight of the prisoner.
And then they check on the rope.
The rope that hangs down from the scaffold.
They'll be doing that tonight.
That scaffold which is so conveniently placed in the cell next to Alec Graham.
What is it that you supporters of the bill actually object to?
Is it what you call legalised killing?
Or is it the method of killing?
I should say it's the killing.
What about war?
Oh, war...
But don't you see that, even in war, the prime objective is not to kill the enemy, it's to protect yourself.
And what about the victim's relatives?
Her sister, for example, how's she supposed to feel?
And what about Alec Graham's father?
Why should he be put through all this torture?
Gentlemen, this is the only punishment which is irrevocable.
Now can we be absolutely certain that we've never made a mistake, and that we won't ever make a mistake?
Are you suggesting that young Graham is not guilty?
I'm not interested in whether young Graham is guilty or innocent.
Another double.
Don't.
- What?
- You mustn't drink now.
Alec is relying on you.
There's no-one else!
What do you want?
Somebody told me something about you... who was it, eh?
Names... I can't do names.
They're too hard!
How long have I been here?
- Well, has it happened?
- No, no.
You've only been here a few minutes.
Hello?
Hello? Clayton here.
Hello, this is Graham.
Oh, I'm glad you called. The Home
Office will see you at 7:30 tonight.
And Alec?
He's still refusing.
He won't talk to me, either.
Well, Alec must talk to me.
Well, you've got to make him talk to me. I...
I don't know what to suggest.
Are you there?
Yeah.
You won't forget? 7:30 tonight.
No! I won't forget. 7:30.
7:30 tonight.
Mr Graham? Alec will talk to me.
Please let me go to the prison with you.
He will see me.
Why are you doing all this for my son?
What difference does it make why?
Hmm, quite.
Why not?
You must stay sober.
You mustn't drink any more.
Please, Mr Graham.
Mr Graham?
From the moment we set eyes on him,
- you would attempt to help him!
- That isn't true!
You did anything you could to encourage him!
And what's more, you didn't engage in ordinary...
- I told you...
- Please, Robert.
I told you I wanted you to have nothing more to do with him.
Now why did you bring him here?
You know I didn't want him here!
We were on our way to the prison when he broke down completely.
Where else could I have taken him?
Now you just listen to me.
I've had enough, see.
You're my wife and you'll do as I tell you, do as I tell you!
Robert, you're hurting me!
No more. Stay away from him!
His son means more to you than I do, doesn't he? Admit it!
Admit what?
Robert, have I ever shamed you?
But you've done nothing but humiliate me since the day we were married.
Would I have gone to her if my wife had given me the love I needed so bad?
Love? You didn't marry me because you loved me.
You married me because I was something different.
Something you'd never had before!
So you thought you wanted me.
What you really wanted was the pleasure of trying to break me and then drag me in your own dirt.
Robert Stanford.
The mighty Robert Stanford!
You're like a sick schoolboy peering through half-open windows.
Don't you say that to me.
Honor?
Honor!
Keep away from me.
No, Honor, don't leave me alone!
Keep away!
Honor!
Do they do that often?
Never as bad as that.
- The call came.
- What call?
There was a letter.
Well, what did it say?
David...
Honor's...
Honor's been wonderful to me, she...
She's always stood up for me, and...
Well, you stood up for her, and now you're even.
What was in the letter?
I wrote it down.
"There's no other way out.
"Try to forgive me."
How was it signed?
It wasn't signed.
How did you know that it existed?
The morning that Jennie was found murdered, I...
I drove my father and Honor in from the country...
They'd spent the night there?
That's what they said.
Later that morning, I was in the living room.
The phone rang, I answered it.
It was the police.
They wanted to talk to Father.
So, I went over to his room.
I could hear Father and Honor in here.
I knocked, but they didn't hear me, so I just came in.
Father was standing there.
Honor was facing him.
They both looked ghastly.
Honor had a gun in her hand.
It was Dad's gun, the one you saw.
When she saw me coming, she quickly tried to hide it.
I told them that the police wanted to talk to them.
What did they say?
Well, Dad asked me to tell them that he'd be at their disposal any time they wanted.
Then I...
I went over to the phone, here.
I picked up the phone, and... while I was on the phone, I...
I could see the two of them in that mirror, there.
I thought I saw Honor put a piece of paper in amongst some old magazines on the table, there.
Later, of course, a secretary sent the magazines off to you.
I didn't think anything about it at the time, until Dad and Honor started to ask about it.
Now, wait...
You said you saw her trying to hide it?
I suppose so.
Then you didn't try to find out what it was?
- I... I didn't want to know.
- Why not?
Well, you see...
You see, I...
I thought that Honor and... and Alec...
Well, one night, I saw Honor coming out of Alec's room.
Late.
We'd better go now, if you feel all right.
"There's no other way out.
Try to forgive me."
On the morning after Jennie Cole was found murdered, you wrote this suicide note.
Why?
- I didn't write that note.
- Who did?
Who did?
That morning, my husband tried to kill himself.
- Your husband?
- Yes.
I'd... I'd known about him and the Harker girl for a long time.
The night of the murder, he was not with me.
He was with her.
He was afraid it would all come out, the scandal, and it was too much for him.
He tried to kill himself.
I told him that I'd say that he'd spent the night with me, and there'd be no scandal.
That is, if Miss Harker agreed not to say anything.
Apparently, Miss Harker agreed.
Your husband, a man like Robert Stanford, threatened to commit suicide because of a breath of scandal?
I don't believe you. You're lying.
No, I'm telling you the truth.
You're lying. You lied in the witness box, and you're lying now!
Mr Graham, there's not much time.
We'd better go, if we're going.
I'll drive you.
It's not breaking the regulations that I'm concerned about.
I'm thinking of the prisoner, your son.
But do you suppose
I'm not thinking of him?
Do you think I want him to be tortured, and...
There's a chance of saving his life.
It's a risk worth taking.
Wait here a moment.
- I've got to see him alone at first.
- No.
- I... I must speak to him privately.
- No, no.
If this is a trick, I want to know.
I want to be told before it happens.
I don't want to be dragged,
I want to know!
- Honor!
- Alec, darling.
Alec.
Alec, I wanted to tell you something.
I don't know if it'll mean anything to you, but... but I want you to know, anyway.
You mean so very much to me.
For a long time,
I didn't realise it myself.
You brought something to me
I'd never had.
Something I needed badly.
Gentleness.
And someone to love.
Does this mean anything to you?
This moment?
Yes, it does.
I thought about it a great deal.
I wondered, perhaps, if I should try and see you here.
But now...
No, I'm glad you came.
Honor... would you kiss me?
- Father!
- Alec!
I'll wait outside.
Oh, Father, I'm sorry
I was cruel to you.
- Oh, that doesn't matter now.
- Father...
I want to live. I don't want to die.
Please save me!
- Alec, listen, there is hope.
- Hope! How?
I've got an appointment, shortly, with the Home Office.
No, I'm not drunk. I've been drinking, but, look, I'm not drunk.
Come, sit down.
- Alec, look, you've got to trust me.
- Yes.
- I've got to ask you a few questions.
- Yes, Father.
What did Mrs Stanford mean just now?
When?
Has there ever been anything between you?
- Between Honor and me?
- Yes.
Yes, late one night, she was seen coming out of your room, Alec.
She...
Oh, that must have been Christmas Eve.
Well, what was she doing in your room?
Well, er...
You see...
I'd been looking forward to Christmas for weeks.
I expected to spend the holidays with... with Jennie.
I could hardly study.
Everything I saw or felt or touched was Jennie, I wanted her so much.
Yes, yes, I understand.
And then... and then suddenly Jennie said she was too busy even to see me.
Well, Honor knew how upset I was.
What was it you asked me about, Father?
About Mrs Stanford in your room.
I...
I suppose she heard me crying.
She came into the room to comfort me.
Christmas Eve. What...?
Somebody said something about Christmas Eve.
Was that the hope?
That you thought there was something between Honor Stanford and...
Was that the hope?
Let me think...
Don't lie to me, Father!
Alec, they're going to send me away, they won't let us stay together anymore.
But please, there is hope, you mustn't give up!
What hope?
Why do you say there's hope?
You're lying.
Just as you did about Mother.
You, you... you wouldn't let me see her unless she promised to come back to you!
That's true, that's perfectly true, but I'm not lying now, Alec.
There's nothing to be done, they're going to kill me!
- No, Alec, no, my boy...
- Stop them! Don't let them!
- Now please, just give us one more minute!
- Father, you'll come back!
- Promise me you'll come back!
- Yes, I promise you, Alec.
No matter what?
- Take it easy, son, take it easy now.
- No! No!
Yes...
I'm in love with Alec.
I never tried to do anything about it, and...
I knew nothing would come of it, ever.
It's there, all the same.
Christmas Eve...
Christmas Eve...
What happened? Is there any hope?
There's always hope.
Look out for Honor, Brian.
Home Office, Henry.
There's been some horrible combination of circumstances.
The boy is innocent, he...
Every relative believes that.
It would be unnatural of you to think otherwise.
And yet murders are done by someone.
The law must be guided by facts, not faith, or justice would never be meted out.
Meted out?
How will the poor broken body of Alec Graham increase the grandeur of the law?
I'm sorry.
I wish it were in my power...
Well, it is in your power!
Take a look there, and write your name.
Give me a few days.
Just a few days.
Forty-eight hours.
Just two days.
I haven't had a chance yet.
I've only just arrived.
Mr Graham was confined in a sanatorium.
Yes. Yes, I know.
But what could you hope to do in a few hours that all the agencies of the law have been unable to do in all these weeks?
People will tell me things that they don't tell everybody.
This office undertook long investigations of its own after the trial.
I myself spoke to psychiatrists who examined your son, to the... prison medical officer, the judge who presided at the trial, counsel for the prosecution, governor of the prison.
I'm deeply sorry, Mr Graham.
Please. Forgive me. May I speak?
What is to be gained by this execution?
After all these thousands of years of torture and hanging, haven't we advanced at all?
Haven't we learned anything?
Please, please give him another day.
Another twenty-four hours.
Right.
Hello, Barnes. You remember me?
David Graham.
We were at Oxford together.
I remember you very well, Graham.
I was half expecting you to come.
Well, then you know that
I've come to ask for help.
What sort of help, Graham?
What do you think
I can do for you?
Help me get a delay.
Of just a few days.
Well, two days. Forty-eight hours.
"Father Begs For 48 Hours
Of Son's Life"
People would read that.
There might be public protests.
Why should I help you, Graham?
Where have you been all these years when there's been a hanging every month?
Is your son a special sort of person?
Why didn't you protest then?
Why didn't you ask me to help one of them?
My son.
There were other fathers.
And other sons.
Tomorrow morning, they'll read the story the way they read any other news item, and then turn to the cricket score.
Just the way you did, hundreds of times.
I remembered you as a human being.
There's gratitude for you!
You were a good story for us, Graham.
The drunk.
So drunk, you couldn't come to see your son until twenty-four hours before he was to die.
Do you know why that story hasn't appeared?
Because we didn't think it relevant to print it.
What do you think should be done with a murderer, Mr Stanford?
Pin a medal on him?
What, you again? He's always asking for
Christmas carols, this chap, he's crazy.
Oh, come on, jazz it up a bit.
Beat it out!
♪ Silent night, holy night
♪ All is quiet, all is bright... ♪
Where were you on the silent night?
Christmas Eve?
I was at home.
With my family.
With my son.
And your son.
He always spent his holidays with us.
Didn't you know that?
How drunk are you?
Oh, yes, you were a father to him.
I'm very drunk.
But not enough.
Well, stop drinking.
D'you hear? Stop it!
He's waiting for you.
You promised you'd go to him.
How can you bear to let him face it alone?
I don't know, I don't know, I...
I don't know anything.
You don't know what it's like to be alone, do you? Do you?
How drunk are you?
It's frightful to be alone.
Ah, go to Alec, go to your son!
Stop shouting at me!
You mustn't let him face it alone.
I can't stand it.
Can't stand it...
Can't stand it!
No, you don't know.
Sometimes... a man has to make big decisions.
Terrible decisions.
And carry them with him alone, for the rest of his life.
Can you understand what I'm saying?
Yes.
And you won't go to him?
You won't go to Alec?
I can't.
I can't.
You see this?
Now, this blacks out everything.
Sort of golden egg.
But it can't black out the man with the rope.
Black him out.
Black him out.
I see a hand, and, in the hand, is a golden locket.
It opens, and there's Alec's face.
Someone had a locket like that.
Used to sit there, opening it and closing it, opening it and closing it.
Sometimes, in the middle of the night, that hand's there, and the locket, and...
Alec's face!
That's why I'm staying with you tonight.
But we mustn't let it get out of control!
That's the wonderful thing about the car.
Control!
You step on the accelerator, she roars!
You let it go, and she whines!
I'm gonna test her tonight.
Do you know what the proving grounds are, Graham?
They're insurance against the unforeseen.
The sudden curve in the road.
The pothole! The obstacle!
All foreseen.
All controlled.
And I'm gonna test it tonight.
Tonight...
Oh, they'll still be there.
I told them to wait until I got there.
Christmas Eve... Christmas Eve...
Christmas Eve... Christmas Eve...
Christmas Eve... Christmas Eve...
Christmas Eve... Christmas Eve...
It was her sister, Agnes.
Agnes Cole.
- What's the time?
- Eh?
What time is it?
I'm sorry, I've got no watch.
- What's the day?
- I beg pardon?
- What day of the week is it?
- It's Tuesday. Near Wednesday now.
Here, here, what's the row?
We're all locked up!
Agnes Cole.
I want to see Agnes Cole.
Huh?
Try the little caff down the alley.
The girls usually get around there.
Agnes!
Christmas Eve.
No, no.
Don't do that.
You said your sister went out on Christmas Eve.
Don't remember what I said.
No, no, no, you said... you said that she came home drunk?
Yes. All black and blue.
Alec wasn't with her on Christmas Eve.
No, no, I've got witnesses who can prove it.
She refused to see him on Christmas Eve.
She was seeing somebody else.
- She was meeting somebody else, secretly.
- Oh, no.
Yes, yes, somebody who didn't wish to be seen with her.
But... well, I...
Jennie didn't tell me!
It was that man that murdered Jennie!
I didn't know.
Mr Graham!
Where is Vickie?
Vickie! I'll call the police!
Where is she?
Who is it?
It's Alec Graham's father.
Oh, so that's who you are.
Miss Harker, I... I...
What are you doing here?
What do you want?
Miss Harker, shortly after the murder, you were given a much better job, weren't you?
- Weren't you?
- He has no right to question you!
Answer me. Answer me.
Yes, my promotion was after the trial.
Vickie!
Why did Stanford want to see you at the flat today?
I don't know why.
I couldn't reach him.
Don't lie to me.
How much did he pay you that was worth my son's life?
- Pay me?
- Yes.
What did he pay you that made it worthwhile to stand by and be silent while a young man dies?
What did Stanford pay you?
Why should Mr Stanford have paid me?
What am I supposed to keep silent about?
The murder.
The murder of Jennie Cole.
On the night of the murder, where were you?
Vickie!
Vickie!
I was...
Shut up, Vickie!
Don't say anything until you've seen Mr Stanford!
I was at Brighton.
My aunt has a café there.
I sometimes help with the weekend rush.
You fool. You little fool!
I thought he'd paid you to be his alibi, but... but he didn't have to pay you.
Mrs Stanford would never have thought of checking on it.
She'd have taken his word!
She'd have taken Stanford's word that he spent the night with you!
She didn't say she went alone to Brighton.
Maybe she was accompanied by a certain gentleman.
- Vickie!
- Shut up, Mother.
Robert Stanford was not with me the night of the murder.
Vickie! Vickie!
Wait for me.
You saw him?
Yes. It was one of the clerks.
The Under-Secretary had gone to bed.
But you told him that Mrs Stanford was willing to testify that she'd lied?
There was a report from the prison of Mrs Stanford's unfortunate visit to Alec.
They couldn't accept her testimony.
Stanford! Let them, let them question Stanford!
You've got to try to understand something, Graham.
It happens every time there's to be an execution.
They get dozens of last-minute alibis, sometimes even confessions!
The clerk told me the Home Office had already got four false confessions on this case.
It's as I told you this morning, only some concrete evidence.
Something tangible.
I'll be at my flat.
I'll be at my flat!
Stanford!
Stanford!
Come out!
Come out of that car!
There's still time, you can't run away!
I've seen Vickie Harker!
You weren't with her!
And Agnes Cole!
You murderer!
Help me!
Help me stop him!
- That's Robert Stanford in the car.
- He's a murderer!
Stanford...
She's wonderful! She's champion!
Guy must be drunk.
No, he's not drunk.
Take no notice of him.
Well, she stood up to it.
She took everything I could give her.
Stanford.
Stanford.
Well, what do you want, Graham?
Telephone the Home Office.
Tell them that you killed Jennie Cole.
You're too late.
- You know that, don't you?
- No, no, not if you telephone.
Why, you're over-excited, Graham.
You've lost control.
Look at your hands.
They're trembling!
You can hardly speak.
If Alec dies, I...
You can't get away with this, Stanford.
I... I know the truth.
What truth do you know?
I know why Alec kept insisting that that girl was drunk.
That counted against him at the trial.
She wasn't drunk, of course, she was... she was just pretending to be drunk.
She wanted to get rid of Alec because she was waiting for you!
And you arranged it that way!
Yes, it was exciting, wasn't it?
To have the girl brought to you by a young man.
It was much safer, too, because nobody would suspect anything.
What happened then, Stanford?
Did she want too much money?
Was that it?
Or... or was it one of your rages?
Now listen to me, Graham.
I'd like you to try and think clearly for once in your life.
I'd like to do something for you.
I feel sorry for what's happened.
I'd like to try and make it up in some way.
Perhaps even give you a few shares in Stanford's.
Enough so that, for the rest of your life, you wouldn't have to worry.
Are you trying to buy me?
Go away, Graham.
Don't bother me.
I've offered to keep you in whisky for the rest of your life.
What they want, and what you'll never get is something tangible.
What do you think you're doing?
Are you trying to frighten me?
What proof have you got?
Put that thing down!
Agnes Cole?
Agnes'll be like her sister, Jennie.
Only she'll be cheaper.
Vickie?
- Is it Mr Clayton's apartment?
- Vickie Harker loves me.
When it comes to the point, she won't do anything to hurt me.
Well, get me Mr Clayton.
Well, come on, Graham, what proof have you got?
- Speak up, speak up!
- Wake him up, then!
They've been searching for months.
Police, detectives, lawyers... searching, searching!
And nobody's searched harder than I have!
There's nothing to connect me with her.
Do you understand that?
I was never seen with Jennie Cole.
Hello, Clayton, this is Graham.
Look, you asked me to find something tangible.
You don't know what it means to be a success.
- Do you?
- Tangible, tangible!
- Well I finally got something tangible.
- You don't know what success means.
Do you, Graham?
- Yes, I understand what it means.
- Well, you see all this?
- This is me!
- Stanford's in here, with me now.
And you see this?
That's you!
Which do you think they'll believe?
He's threatening to kill me.
To kill you? Stanford?
Are you there?
Look, if anything happens to me, tell Alec to live a full and wonderful life.
This is your gun, Stanford.
Now, I'm being realistic.
You won't save Alec by killing me!
I know that.
Oh!
Stay away from me, Graham.
I don't want to hurt you.
Don't make me angry, Graham!
What are you afraid of, huh?
You've already killed Jennie Cole!
And you're going to kill Alec!
Don't talk to me about Alec!
Don't tell me how much you love him!
What have you ever done for him?
What'd you ever give him? Nothing!
I've given him more than you have in the whole of your life!
What was he to you?
Someone to weep over when you're drunk?
What are you doing?
Graham!
You didn't think I'd let Alec die, just like that, did you?
Graham!
Graham!
- Here.
- Not here. Garden room.
Father!
Father!
- The door's locked.
- Well, there's another door.
- It's around this way.
- Robert!
Well, let's try the other door, quickly!
Honor.
I didn't do it!
He killed himself!
He's dead.
Yeah. Yeah.
Oh, but I didn't do it!
It was... We...
What are you doing, Brian?
Honor!
Tell him to stop it!
But I didn't do it!
I swear, I swear,
I swear I didn't do it!
Mr Clayton, this is Brian Stanford.
I think you'd better ring the Home Office right away.
My father's just killed David Graham.
Yes.
Yes.
Now you can stop them hanging Alec.
All right. All right, Mr Clayton.

Mr. Gannon.
Mr. Gannon! Running orders.
I know, Mr. Crowley.
Not these!
You never had the like of this.
9:16 pm, it says here.
February 22, 1861.
"Born to civil unrest.
"All trains will operate with caution and reduced speed.
"Effective immediately."
You can thank the radical Republicans!
This boiler will never run on time again.
A fine way to run a railroad!
A fine way to run a country!
Republicans are secessionists.
My aim is to bring the Flyer into Washington depot at 9 am.
If the Good Lord is willing.
Good Lord may be willing.
But that order to slow down was signed by P.J. Donovan, division manager.
Inspector Reilly, New York police.
I am looking for a man.
What's he wanted for?
He's not. He's a friend of mine.
I'm seeing him off.
I've got his ticket and his baggage.
How long before the gates open?
- Another 15 minutes.
- Oh.
Berth 7 Car 42.
Why don't you go keep your seat warm, inspector?
Oh, much obliged.
Tell me his name.
Nd I'll keep an eye out for him.
His name is Kennedy. John Kennedy.
How much longer?
Listen, Kennedy.
I told him you're waiting.
Tell him again.
My train leaves in an hour.
He said he'd call you. He's busy now.
Oh.
So I hear.
Hey! Where are you going?
Get back here.
Now, see here, Kennedy.
I want my report back.
Your report?
Well, there's your report.
And it's hogwash!
Everyone in the department says it's hogwash.
This report was confidential to you, Mr. Stroud.
Except for the copy I sent to the Secretary of War.
When you're Superintendent, you can decide what's confidential around here.
And who are you to go direct to the War Department?
For the last time, will you take action, Mr. Stroud?
If you don't, there'll be a shooting in Baltimore tomorrow that'll blow this country apart.
- What's this?
- Hogwash!
There's still time, Mr. Stroud.
Have you seen the evening paper?
"The President-elect plans to spend tonight in Harrisburg,
"leaving early by special train for Baltimore.
"where he intends to make a speech
"before continuing to Washington for his inauguration."
Will you telegraph?
No!
Wait a minute, son.
It wouldn't be the new president who's been picked for the shooting, would it?
It would. During his speech tomorrow.
If you're sure of that,
I'll go to Baltimore myself.
That's one speech
I wouldn't want to miss.
Are you certain there's nothing to it, Simon?
Sgt. Kennedy was detailed for two days to guard Abe Lincoln when he was electioneering in New York last fall.
He thinks he still on the assignment.
Well, I've got to be on my way.
- I've got a train to make myself.
- Good luck to you, Colonel.
Don't stand next to
Lincoln tomorrow, Caleb.
You never can tell when them sharpshooters will miss.
Good luck to you, Sergeant!
I take to a man who stands up for what he believes in.
Even if it is hogwash.
I'm going to Baltimore tonight.
I'll get to someone in authority.
You'll cut across channels.
And I'll bust you!
I'll save you the trouble.

Show your tickets, please.
All tickets, please.
Tickets.
I am Mrs. Charlotte Alsop.
You may have read my books.
I'll be with you all the way to Washington.
Traveling is such an ordeal these days, isn't it?
Nothing – absolutely nothing – short of an appointment with the new president could induce me to take this trip.
Now that I'm on my way,
I intend to tell him a thing or two about his shilly-shallying.
Cabin B. Car 27, Mrs. Alsop.
Doesn't Mr. Lincoln know that seven states have seceded already?
For heaven sakes, what is the man waiting for?
He's waiting to be inaugurated.
- What are you waiting for, lady?
- Cabin B.
I say Mr. Lincoln must take a firm stand against slavery once and for all.
Now don't you agree?
As far as I'm concerned, madame, the new president is
Jefferson Davis from Mississippi.
Secessionist!
Keep the line moving, please.
Pardon me, conductor.
Did an Inspector Reilly leave tickets for Kennedy? John Kennedy?
Kennedy? John Kennedy?
Berth 7 Car 42.
Go right on through.
You'll find Inspector Reilly aboard.
He's got your ticket.
Thank you.
Tickets, please.
Right this way, please.
Car 27.
Car 43.
Tickets, please.
Tickets.
I beg your pardon.
I'm looking for the man who was carrying this the valise.
He has my ticket. Did you see him?
I'm afraid not.
He must've been here.
He left the bag.
Wooo!
What was it? Are we moving now?
Each state has the right to do as it pleases.
I'm from Carolina myself.
And I'm going back home to look after my tobacco.
Pardon me, gentlemen.
Did either of you see a man...
Because if that black Republican ever sets foot in the White House, it's war, sir.
- Unmitigated war!
- You, sir.
Did you see the man over here?
I'll wager he never reaches Washington.
Too many people are gunning for hm.
I'm missing someone.
I'm in here in section 7.
He'll show up once were moving.
They usually do.
But he isn't going with me.
He has my ticket.
Then you better get off and buy another one.
If there's any left, you can turn it into the conductor.
In case your man shows up.
But you'll have to hurry.
Thank you.
Reilly? Tim Reilly.
Ten o'clock Night Flyer Express for Washington, Track 2.
All aboard!
Night Flyer Express for Washington.
And points south now ready on Track 2.
Train for New Brunswick…
Sorry, the window's closed.
No more tickets.
No more tickets, sir.
Excuse me. I've gotta get a ticket to Philadelphia.
Closed.
What's the matter?
No more room on the train?
I gotta get to Philadelphia!
I must have one more ticket for my brother Lt. Beaufort.
If it's skirts that influence you,
I've got dozens of them right here.
I gotta be in Wilmington tomorrow morning to show them to a buyer.
Since when does a drummer take priority over an officer?
I must have that ticket.
A hundred dollars?
I can't make change, Miss.
I don't want any change.
If that's the last space,
I'd like to take it.
New York Police Department.
I beg your pardon.
- No more room on the train.
- You'll be more than sorry.
Good thing I found it.
Hey, Ginny. What's going on here?
This man took your ticket.
Ginny, I have my own ticket.
I'm old enough now to take care of myself you know.
Must all you New Yorkers be so insufferably boorish?
I'm sorry, mister.
But this is police business.
I don't believe you're a policeman at all.
Show me your badge.
Next time try the one about your dying grandmother!
Take your place. Let me in line.
Your money, "Inspector."
Hey, you!
Giddy-up there.
Whoa! Whoa!
Giddy-up there. Whoa, whoa!
Whoa!
Lady, are you sure you didn't see the man who was holding my seat for me?
Quite sure.
- He was about 50. Wore glasses.
- I'm sorry.
You mean the man who left that bag?
I saw him.
Where did he go?
- What will you give me if I tell you?
- Winfield!
How about a nice three cent piece?
- The man went away.
- Where?
I don't know. Just away.
Giddy-up there. Whoa, whoa!
Come on. Giddy-up there.
Have the accommodations for Evans. F and G.
There'll be three of us.
My husband is getting aboard at Philadelphia with his doctor.
He's very ill.
He had a seizure this morning.
We must get him home to Charleston.
Oh, yes. I have a letter from the president of the railroad.
Excuse me.
Just a minute.
We'll appreciate as much quiet as possible at this end of the car.
Oh.
I'll see to it personally, Mrs. Gibbons.
Ticket, mister.
It's back in the Car 42.
Yes. I'll catch you in a few minutes.
Fire tilt.
Sgt. Kennedy, New York police.
Did you see or hear a struggle, madame?
I seen or heard nothing.
There must've been at least two men.
One was around 50. Wore glasses.
Had florid face.
I left specific instructions.
I was not to be disturbed!
Good night.
"When the South Carolina militia captured the federal post,
"they tore down your Stars & Stripes.
"And ran up their own Palmetto flag.
"Re-dress this indignity if you dare.
"But no. You have submitted to it for two months.
"And you will submit forever."
Why it's outrageous!
The man should be horsewhipped!
George Kelvin is a windbag
What is he doing in the Senate anyways?
I thought Texas had seceded from the Union.
You mean the Union has succeeded from Texas, ma'am.
Well!
I see you had your way.
You didn't say you're going to be on this train, Colonel.
Well, there's only one train south at night, son.
You look as if you need a drink!
- Come on in.
- No, thank you. . Maybe later.
Well, you're welcome anytime.
We got the longest bar in the world –
New York to Baltimore!
Baltimore? You’re going to Baltimore?
Yes. Didn't you see my Zouaves?
We're in they procession tomorrow.
And if there's going to be any shooting, let's hope they wait until we pass.
Woo-wo-woo woo!
Woo-wo-woo woo!
Woo woo woo!
Madame, were being driven mad.
Will you have the kindness to make that child of yours shut up?
Wo-wo-wo-woo woo!
Woo-wo-woo!
Winfield!
Want something?
My coat and my seat if you're through with them.
Are you sure you have the right car?
That's my coat. Take it off!
Your coat? What coat?
We got a fight going on here?
I don't know.
My name is John Kennedy.
This is Berth 7 Car 42, isn't it?
That's my ticket and my coat.
Berth 7 Car 42.
John Kennedy.
- Well, let me see your ticket.
- That's my ticket.
This galute's crazy.
I'm John Kennedy.
You got some identification, Mr. Kennedy?
That's my letter and my gun.
You got some identification too?
Certainly.
"To my son John Kennedy from his loving father,
"on this occasion of his graduation from
"Saint Anthony school. June 25, 1845."
It's not such a rare name.
I'll concede there could be two John Kennedys.
There's only one ticket.
And it's mine.
Look, conductor. You remember me.
I came through the gate asking for a man by the name of Reilly.
And you didn't have a ticket. You said –
You two argue this out between you.
All I know is that
I'm sleeping here tonight.
Will you see that the berth is made up?
I'm going out for a smoke.
Now, look, mister. I am a conductor.
My business is to collect tickets.
And if you haven't got one, you get off this train in New Brunswick.
There's an army officer in the other car.
Col. Jeffers. He'll identify me.
All right.
If he doesn't, you've got a long walk.
Come in.
Well, this is a happy surprise.
I was afraid it was gonna have to drink alone.
Sorry to bother you, Colonel.
But this man claims that you can identify him.
Of course! He's Sgt. Kennedy at the New York police.
Well, now that were acquainted, let's have a drink.
There still no space left.
And he still hasn't got a ticket.
Here! Hold this.
The quartermaster had me buy two tickets for this cabin.
I'm traveling alone.
He might as well use the extra one.
- I owe you an apology, Sergeant.
- Forget it.
And let that smooth-talking rascal sleep in Berth 7 Car 42?
Not on my train!
Let him sleep where he is.
Not while I'm conductor.
I'll handle this.
This is police business.
Mister, have a drink.
Not while I'm on duty.
Oh, come on. Come on.
This is a tonic.
Here. I'll get you some water.
Not dilute its medicinal value.
Thanks, Colonel.
It's working.
Fortune like they say?
There's a fickle game.
Until this morning,
I was plain Mr. Caleb Jeffers.
Delivered my state precinct.
Traded a few votes for a few favors, give or take.
Tonight I'm Col. Jeffers of the Poughkeepsie Zouaves.
You heard what I said in Stroud's office.
You're a straight ticket man.
The same is he is.
Why are you helping me?
Mind you. I don't say that
Simon Stroud was wrong.
But he could be.
I'll admit that old Abe is the last man
I ever wanted to see in the White House.
But I don't hold with violence.
Why not?
It's the only way the Democrats can get another election.
You don't know voters.
Killing Lincoln would make a martyr out of him.
Then they'd put the Republicans in for the next 20 years to salve their consciences.
Incidentally, uh…
What's in this business for you?
You don't have to tell me, son.
A man has a right to his ambition.
And it's a good gamble.
Mr. Lincoln puts more value on his life than a sergeant's pay.
It's more than a gamble.
A friend of mine named Reilly was murdered aboard this train tonight.
The man who killed him thought he was getting rid of me.
Somebody doesn't want me to get to Baltimore.
The party who took over your berth?
Or whoever is paying him.
Right now, I need a gun.
Can I borrow yours?
I don't know. With a person's firearms, a man could get hurt.
You never can tell when you need a shot.
No more.
I've still got to find a gun.
Be careful.
It's loaded.
Oh, I'm interested in guns.
Lance is very proud of those pieces.
They were his father's.
I see he hunts too.
Why, yes.
Lance is a mighty good shot.
Tell me. Is he going to get off in Baltimore or going on through?
Oh, he's going all the way to Atlanta with us.
What is it, Rachel?
This man's interested in your guns,
Mr. Beaufort.
Oh, he is?
This is it.
Two killings for the price of one, huh?
There wouldn't have to be if you'd mind your own business.
Have a smoke?
You hand off cigars to all your victims?
It gives them something to do with their hands.
Three minutes stop. New Brunswick.
This is where we get off.
Wrong side, Mr. Kennedy.
Get your pillows!
Down toward the engine, Mr. Kennedy.
Papers!
Papers! Papers!
Get your pillows!
Papers!
Who wants something?
This is good.
Mind if I smoke this now?
I don't like to see fine tobacco go to waste.
Go ahead.
I'm waiting for the whistle.
Aboard!
Red Flag. Washington. And points south.
All passengers, BOARD!
Who's giving you orders?
Who is it?
Talk! Who is it?
No! Noo! NO!
Did you hear that?
Come on.
Who is it?
He's in Car 27!
Hold the train, Mr. Gannon!
Who is it?
Kennedy.
You don't need a doctor.
Just a long box.
- Who did it?
- I did.
May I pull the task pail, Mr. Crowley?
Go ahead.
Hold it, Mr. Gannon.
Can I see you for a moment, please?
I'm Col. Caleb Jeffers of the 6th Zouaves.
Here are my orders.
Orders or no orders, Colonel.
The country's not under military law.
Not yet.
The sheriff will want to ask you some questions.
The Provost Marshal in Baltimore can answer them.
My men and I need to parade there tomorrow.
This is Sgt. Kennedy of the New York police.
I'll vouch for him.
The Inaugural Express is due in Baltimore in 10 hours.
Sgt. Kennedy and I are preceding it.
We expected trouble. But not so soon.
Well, what will I do with him?
Put him on ice until you hear from the War Department.
Pretty fast talking, Colonel.
Pretty fast riding for me.
Pretty fancy shooting too, for anyone.
So, Sarge. You want to hit me?
That's the cabdriver's take.
The important thing is I plugged him.
Yeah, thanks.
You told me you didn't have a gun.
I didn't.
I had to borrow this from one of my men.
What for?
For you.
Ain't much of a pistol.
One shot and you're through.
Or the other fellow is.
Bullets?
There. They may come in handy.
You know I don't know anything about a plot against Lincoln's life.
But there certainly seems to be one against yours.
You have to have a nightcap.
I've got work to do.
I'll have one myself. I could use it.
Hogwash, huh?
That's what Simon Stroud called it.
Do you mind if I read it too?
I don't see why not?
Everyone else has.
Two weeks ago, I was sent to Baltimore in a routine assignment.
I didn't find our suspect.
They turned up a better one.
- See that man?
- Mmm-hmm.
His name is Fernandina.
The first time I met him was in his barber shop.
At the Barnum Hotel.
He was giving me a shave.
He never stopped talking politics.
He said the elections were crooked.
And if that man lived or set in the White House, he'd split the country and bring on a war.
Well, you don't have to go to Baltimore to hear talk like that.
Something in the way he spoke made me listen.
I made friends with him.
One night he took me to a secret society he was mixed up with.
When I heard what was going on,
I joined up.
Secret password, it says here.
"Dagger on a Bible."
It reminds me of when I was a young one.
A very young one.
That's the way it struck me too – until I heard the rest of it.
They've got numbers. Hundreds.
Maybe thousands.
Southern hotheads I suppose.
Add a few cool ones from the North.
Well, it seems to me you've got a case after all.
By the way, did you learn anything from our departed friend back in New Brunswick?
He admitted he had a contact in the Car 27.
But he wasn't under oath.
Worse. He was under the wheels.
Not much to go on. But it's a start.
You play whist?
Yeah, why?
There's nothing like a two-handed card game to attract onlookers.
Let's go back to the parlor.
These observations will be of great importance when I present my views to Mr. Lincoln.
And for my new book as well.
I'm writing another…
Watch the aisle a moment.
Mrs. Stowe isn't the only literary lady in New England.
But no one can say that
I'm not equally permissive.
I sure I'm very grateful for allowing me to talk to your slave, Miss Beaufort.
After all,
I've never talked to a slave before.
We don't have them in Boston you know.
Oh, it's quite all right, Mrs. Alsop.
I'm sure the experience is as novel for Rachel as it is for you.
Oh!
Have you lost something, Mrs. Alsop?
My – my jottings. My literary jottings.
I must've missed placed them somewhere.
Pardon me.
Pardon me.
Do you mind, Mr. Ogden?
I'm sure you're sitting on my jottings.
Oh!
No jottings.
I must have left them in my cabin.
Pardon me.
Pardon me, please.
Oh, Mrs. Alsop.
Yes.
Your jottings.
Oh, dear. I was sitting on them!
Thank you so much.
You must forgive me.
I'm such a scatter-brain.
I'm always losing my jottings.
My husband tells me they're strewn all over Boston.
Now let me see. Where were we?
Oh, tell me, my dear.
How does it feel being beaten?
They did beat you, of course?
Yes, of course.
Rachel, don't be so absurd.
They did too, Miss Ginny.
Remember the Christmas ball when we slid down the banister together?
You forget to tell, Mrs. Alsop.
We were ten years old.
They spanked me too.
That didn't make me hurt any less.
Now there's one question more.
If you slaves were free, would you go back to Africa to live?
Madame!
Don't interrupt, Lance.
Mrs. Alsop is going to put Rachel in a book.
Something along the lines of Uncle Tom's Cabin.
She is, if she?
Oh, I don't mind, Mr. Lance.
Africa?
Oh, I don't think so.
It seems such a long ways off.
And I don't know anybody there.
I've lived in Tall Trees all my life.
Well, you'll change your mind – the day slavery is abolished.
When you know what freedom is.
I know what it is.
And now, Mrs. Alsop.
If you've pried sufficiently into our benighted Southern affairs,
I'm sure my sister and the maid would like to retire.
Well!
I'll see that your cabin is made up.
Wait a minute, sonny. Wait a minute.
I know you're a West Point lieutenant.
And I'm only a colonel in the militia.
But don't they teach lieutenants to salute colonels up there at the point?
I'm sorry, sir.
I've only had my uniform four hours.
And haven't been saluted yet.
You may as well be the first.
Congratulations on your commission,
Colonel.
Come here, sonny.
Oh, excuse me.
Well now, how about that game of whist?
I'm your man. But as I told you, son.
Cards is the invention of the devil.
It must've been invented on a long train ride.
Well, we can't say this one has been too dull, can we?
What with the shooting back there in New Brunswick.
Does anyone know who the man was who was shot?
I wish I knew myself.
Restless times.
Let us hope the country will settle down after Mr. Lincoln is inaugurated.
I'd inaugurate him– with a stout rope from the White House chandelier.
You sound as if you've lost a bet, friend.
A bet?
We've lost a country, Colonel.
Six months from today, the United States will be busted.
Ogden's the name. Tom Ogden.
- Hartford. Building supplies.
- Caleb Jeffers.
Trenton, next stop!
Trenton in five minutes.
Last chance for supper at the station restaurant.
I'm not expecting a boom, mind you.
But I can't share your extreme pessimism either.
You would if you've lost as many contracts as I have in the last two months.
Nobody wants to build with a war coming on.
Lincoln isn't president yet.
If those firebrands in Baltimore have their way tomorrow, he never will be.
Your cabin is ready, sir.
Oh, dear.
I do hope we don't run into violence in Baltimore.
I have an appointment on Pratt Street.
Anything could happen in Baltimore.
It's a nest of secessionists.
I'm getting off at Baltimore too.
If somebody puts a bullet in Abe Lincoln,
I'll be the first to shake his hand.
That man is heading us straight into a war.
I wouldn't let Mr. Ogden get too close to your rifle, mister.
The temptation might be too much for him.
With one of those newfangled telescope sights, he could probably hit Lincoln from 500 yards off.
Have you tried one of those new sights, mister?
Not yet.
Well, I guess the shooting is pretty good in Georgia now.
It'll get better.
Or Baltimore.
If you happen to be getting off there too.
Just what do you mean, sir?
If the secessionist haven't repealed it, there's a law against shooting a President-elect.
You have to wait till March 4.
I find your tone offensive.
Lance!
I'm aware that all Southerners are regarded as criminals in this part of the country.
And we should be accustomed to these indignities.
My brother and I have nothing to conceal.
If we were getting off in Baltimore, it'd be none of your concern.
But it happens that we're going through to Atlanta.
Aren't we, Lance?
Of course!
My brother is resigning from the military academy.
And will wait at Tall Trees to be called for the colors.
The Confederate colors.
Now is there any other personal business you want to know?
No. I guess not.
Come see me to my cabin.
Last chance for supper at the station restaurant.
I guess we won't learn anything playing whist.
We didn't do too bad.
And by the way, Mr. Ogden is a likely prospect.
John Kennedy.
Telegram for John Kennedy.
Here!
John Kennedy.
Right here, boy.
- Kennedy?
- That's right.
Telegram, sir.
Here.
Thank you kindly.
Probably from Stroud.
No.
"John Kennedy,
Washington Night Fllyer, en route.
"Regret unable transmit telegram to A. Lincoln,
Harrisburg, due to interruption of service.
"Eastern Electric Telegraph Company."
Well, that's that.
Well, maybe you can get through in Philadelphia.
We'll see.
So you were impressed with Mr. Ogden, huh?
Weren't you?
He talks big.
He struck me as an explosive character.
He would shoot off anything but his mouth.
Don't lock the door.
It's snow, by God.
Well, that doesn't surprise me none.
I've had a feeling of rheumatism in my leg all evening.
- Are you tired?
- A little bit.
Well, you better catch your nap.
I'll sit up.
Thanks, Colonel.
I never could sleep on the train myself.
Might as well make ourselves comfortable.
The gun is in my jacket just in case.
So you were impressed with Ogden?
Well, now, maybe he wouldn't shoot Lincoln himself.
Like you say.
But he might hire somebody to do it.
- Like young Beaufort?
- Maybe.
Beaufort is full of strong convictions.
Has a mean temper.
And a rifle with telescope.
He's capable of killing Lincoln all right.
But not on his own.
Beaufort is a fanatic. Not an organizer.
You may be right though.
He might be taking orders from someone.
I still say it's Ogden.
No. Ogden is too obvious.
The man who is working with Fernandina is...
I started to say the man we want is smoother.
It would take a man of your brains,
Colonel.
I pried the led out of the cartridge.
I told you I wasn't much of a hand with firearms.
You were back there.
I shouldn't have saved your life.
You shot wild in the steam because you couldn't see.
But you had nothing to lose.
If you didn't get me, you'd at least keep your own man from talking.
You overplayed your hand, Colonel.
You're smarter than I figured you to be.
I never underestimated you.
I'm turning you over to the police in Philadelphia.
Go ahead.
But you better figure on staying over to testify against me.
I could give you the bullet you intended for me.
And throw you out the window.
Nobody would know the difference.
There'd be a rope around your neck as soon as they found me.
We'll wait.
What do you want?
I know you're in this for everything you get out of it.
Something more than a police sergeant's pay.
I don't want your money.
Look, son.
I'm a man with a finger in a lot of pies.
One of them is
Northern cotton mill shares.
You know what will happen to those mills if war came.
And the supply of raw cotton was cut off from the South.
I guess I'd have to change to wool.
There are two kinds of people in this world, Kennedy.
One kind yells their head off.
And doesn't get anywhere.
Like that judge at Ogden.
Or that Mrs. what's her name there.
The fuddy-duddy abolitionist from Boston.
The other kind keep their mouth shut.
Votes a straight ticket.
And puts out some –
– where it will do some good.
What do you say?
Get your coat.
Change cars at Philadelphia for west.
Philadelphia.
Where can I find Lt. Coulter?
Coulter? He's just about going off duty now.
I want to see him.
He's at headquarters.
You can catch him there if you hurry.
There isn't that much time.
I'm Sgt. Kennedy of the New York police.
And I have an important arrest.
What's the charge?
Suspicion of intent to commit murder.
Murder?
I'm Col. Jeffers of the
Poughkeepsie State Zouaves Guard.
Here are my official traveling orders.
This will tel you more about me.
I never argue with law. No, sir.
This is over your head, officer.
Will you get Coulter, please?
This is a personal letter which will further identify me.
Note the stationary and the signature.
Joseph Grifton, the Secretary of War.
I see.
Now that you've seen my credentials,
I suggest you check on his.
Do you have identification?
Coulter will identify me.
This man must be a lunatic.
He has no badge. No authority.
No right to have me held.
He's been annoying me ever since he came on the train.
You better get Coulter, officer.
Or else there's gonna be trouble.
They'll be a lot more trouble if I'm not on the Flyer when she pulls out.
You know who I am.
I'll be in Cabin A Car 27.
Just a minute.
You have 20 minutes, Colonel.
Daniel!
Get Lt Coulter! It's urgent.
He's at headquarters.
Tell him that Sgt Kennedy of the New York police wants him.
To make an important arrest.
You made a bad mistake, young man.
So? You want the police?
Well, you'll have your wish.
Where do you think you're going?
To send a telegram.
To Superintendent Stroud of the New York police.
Any objections?
I want to send a telegram to New York.
How long will it be before
I can get an answer?
I'm sorry. But I don't think you can get an answer from New York before the Flyer leaves.
It usually takes close to an hour.
But this is most urgent.
Dispatcher's orders for the Flyer in yet?
Coming in right now.
You sure this is right?
It was repeated twice.
But it can't be.
Hold up the Flyer for the delivery of a package?
That's what it says.
Dang. Wait till Mr. Gannon hears about this!
You may get your answer through at that.
The Flyer's being held up.
Good. Well, this message goes to Superintendent Stroud of the New York police.
An hour and 20 minutes late!
What kind of a train is this?
You'll pull out when I tell you to, Mr. Gannon.
We've had our share of trouble with the raiders trying to cut us off from the North.
And it's likely they're out there again tonight.
And you've got better than 200 souls aboard.
You take my meaning, Mr. Gannon.
- You, Mr. Crowley?
- I have no alternative.
You may give the highball, Mr. Crowley, as soon as the package is delivered to you.
Make sure that it gets into the stationmaster's hands when you pull into Washington.
We still haven't heard from the New York police.
We will.
Good to see you, Coulter.
Don't be so sure, John.
This is from Superintendent Stroud.
To Chief of Police, Philadelphia.
"John Kennedy is suspected
"of impersonating an officer of the New York Police Department.
"of which he's no longer a member,
" He's wanted for questioning in the death of police Lt. Tim Reilly.
"Please have Kennedy returned to New York for the next train North.
Signed, Stroud.
Make this easy for me, will you, John?
I suppose it'll do no good –
What if it were the other way around?
All right.
Too bad, John.
But you wanted it that way.
Oh.
I nearly walked off without my property.
You won't need my gun where you're going.
Maybe I will.
Thanks.
I hate to do this, John.
But let's get it over with.
I have to be back here at dawn to put a detail on the yard.
The Inauguration Special is coming through Baltimore with Mr. Lincoln aboard.
Is he all right?
He has withstood the journey fairly well so far.
May I be of some assistance,
Mrs. Gibbons?
Thank you, Mr. Crowley.
But I think we can manage.
I'll standby just in case.
Thank you. It won't be necessary.
Steady.
Easy.
It's just a little way more, dear.
Has his berth then made up?
Of course.
Be careful on the steps.
Mr. Kennedy?
What do you want?
I have something to tell you.
It's important. Very important!
What is it, Rachel?
Sorry, John.
Talk to him at the station house after he's been booked.
Let's go.
We're not going to walk to headquarters, are we?
You got any better ideas this time of night?
Here comes an empty carriage.
Come on. This will be on me.
All right, cabbie. Over here.
Take us to headquarters.
John!
John, come back!
I am looking for the division manager.
You're looking straight at him.
I believe you've been waiting for this.
For what?
Please sign here.
Hallelujah!!
Here. Take care of it. Good care of it.
All clear, Mr. Crowley.
Board!!!
Did you see a man go by here – no hat or coat?
Nope.
The name is Kennedy. John Kennedy.
Lt. Coulter, Philadelphia police.
Kennedy? Is he in trouble again?
He's wanted by the New York Police
Department for impersonating –
I had him in custody.
And he got away.
Impersonating a –
Mr. Crowley, I hate to disturb you.
But how many more packages are you waiting for?
Keep your shirt on, Mr. Gannon.
I'm holding this train until we've found Kennedy.
No!!!!
How many people are running this train?
It's not how many are running it, Mr. Gannon.
How many are stopping it?
I'd like to help you out, Lieutenant.
But we've got our orders.
And the Flyer is leaving.
Board!!!
Then it's leaving without you,
Mr Crowley, because I'm putting you under arrest for obstructing the law.
Take care of him.
Oh, all right.
That's more like it.
You stay at this end.
And keep your eye open.
Post a brakeman on the rear platform.
We'll start at that end and work forward.
What's the matter?
Your friend Sgt. Kennedy is loose again.
My men and I will help you search.
Come on.
Sergeant!
Oh, sergeant!
Sergeant!
Sorry, Lieutenant. We couldn't find him.
We will.
He can't have gone far.
Mr. Gannon.
BOARD!!!!
All aboard!!!!
I'm still not satisfied he isn't aboard that train.
You keep watch for him here at the station.
I'll ride along as far as Derby Junction.
Right.
Scared ya, didn't I?
I said you'd come back.
But Mommy said you wouldn't.
I'm pretty smart for my age.
Shh! Quiet!
What are you doing?
I'm playing a game with the conductor.
Can I play too?
You take every berth on this side.
I'll take this side.
Sorry to disturb you, ma'am.
Uh, you take that side.
- And I'll take the side.
- Yes, sir.
We're looking for a man.
What is going on around here?
Excuse me.
Sorry to disturb you, madame.
I think they're all right.
We'll be pulling into Derby Junction in 15 or 20 minutes now, Lieutenant.
You'll have to drop off there.
Or go into Wilmington.
I'll get off at Darby.
Officer Seven. You don't suppose Kennedy will be back in his own berth, do you?
Well, he's got enough brass to try anything.
Hello, sonny. We're looking for a man with dark hair and a gray suit.
No overcoat. And no hat.
Have you seen him?
What will you give me if I tell you?
Here you are, sonny.
Winfield!
We're looking for a man named Kennedy.
The berth was going to waste.
You said the young man wasn't coming back.
I hope you don't mind my putting Winfield.
At least at night.
All right.
But, Mommy!
Go to sleep, Winfield.
But, Mommy!
Not another word out of you!
All right.
No one's seen him in Car 47, sir.
Is there anything more my men and I can do?
I don't think we missed anybody.
What do I do with this?
What is it?
The package they put on in Philadelphia.
"E.J. Ward, Willard Hotel."
"Care of station master, Washington DC."
Heard of him?
No. Must be a mighty big potato to hold up the Washington Flyer for an hour and a half.
Lock it up in the baggage car.
Excuse me, please.
Looks like he got away, Lieutenant.
Yes. I guess he gave us the slip in Philadelphia.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Good luck.
Mr. Gannon.
We must be hitting 70!
Seventy is fine, Mr. Crowley.
We might make enough time.
It's my business too.
Have you read orders to slow down?
Your business is to keep your shoes under your post, Mr. Crowley.
You tend to your end.
And I'll tend to mine.
You'll find the water over there.
Mr. Kennedy.
What is it you wanted to tell me?
You had something to tell me, Rachel.
What is it?
About Mr. Lincoln.
Are you sure they want to shoot him?
The shooting? Yes.
Mr. Lance wouldn't do anything like that.
There are 20 men coming into Baltimore from 20 states to do the job.
Not one of the 20 knows who the other 19 are.
They timed it right to the minute.
Abe Lincoln would be a sitting pigeon to those sharpshooters.
And Mr. Lance has a rifle with a new telescopic sight.
Here's his ticket.
I found it in his greatcoat.
He wasn't telling Miss Ginny the truth.
He isn't going home to Tall Trees.
Then I was right.
He is getting off at Baltimore.
Good night.
Miss Beaufort?
Paper.
Yes, Mr. Lance?
Are you and Miss Ginny all right?
Yes, Mr. Lance.
She's sleeping.
Well, you get some sleep yourself.
Good night.
I'm afraid for him.
You should be.
Anyone who fires at Lincoln tomorrow won't live five minutes.
What will you do to him?
You'll put him in jail?
I wish I could.
I don't have the authority.
I need one of his guns, Rachel.
Promise me you won't hurt Mr. Lance.
I can't promise that.
Look, Rachel.
I'm no Republican or abolitionist.
But I guided Mr. Lincoln while he was campaigning in New York.
I helped him open a window.
He held a door for me.
I found a parcel for him.
Some nightshirts in the laundry.
I was only with him for 48 hours.
But when he left, he shook my hand and thanked me.
He wished me well.
I was never so taken with a human man.
You gave him a gun to use on Mr. Lance?
Tell Mr. Lance to step in here.
No, Miss Ginny.
Get over him now, Rachel.
We'll be in the South soon. Tell him.
Very soon.
Lance…. Lance!
I can't believe this is happening,
Rachel.
You and I grew up like sisters.
Lance has been your brother as much as mine.
- I know that, Miss Ginny.
- Like sisters?
Only you're free and she's a slave.
Rachel is as free as I am.
You know that.
That's why you never thought to ask for your freedom.
And why I never thought of giving it to you.
Freedom isn't it thing you should be able to give me, Miss Ginny.
Freedom is something
I should've been born with.
Thanks anyway, Rachel.
What is he doing here?
He wanted this.
Turn around and face the wall!
Lance!
Lance, you're going to kill him!
Stay away from him!
I need to speak to the conductor!
Wait, Ginny. Don't ring him.
Why not?
Because Mr. Kennedy knows he's getting off in Baltimore.
That's why.
That's a lie.
No it isn't. Tell her, Mr. Lance.
I am getting off at Baltimore.
But you said you were coming to Tall Trees with us.
I'll come to Tall Trees when it's safe again.
When a man can live in peace and in honor.
You must have business in Baltimore.
Yes, when I finish my business in Baltimore.
Lance.
You wouldn't murder!
Not murder.
There's a difference between a political assassination and murder.
What could happen if that war monger is inaugurated?
That would be murder.
It would take only one bullet to save thousands of lives of Southerns and Northern troops.
I hope it's mine.
Next stop, Wilmington.
Wilmington, next stop.
Wilmington!
Next stop, Wilmington.
Wilmington.
What are you going to do with him?
I'll turn him over to the police in Wilmington.
You're lying.
Just like you lied about going home to Tall Trees.
Go back to bed, Ginny.
You wouldn't turn him over to the conductor.
And you're not going to turn him over to the police.
They'll hang you!
Ginny's right, Mr. Lance.
Listen to what she's saying.
Now both of you. Get back to bed.
Your friend, Mr. Kennedy.
Can he sleep it off it here?
Of course. Bring him in.
Here. Put that away.
We've got to get rid of him.
Are you insane?
The Philadelphia police heard him accuse me of making an attempt on his life.
I can't afford to have anything happen to him in here.
What'll we do with him?
He's wanted by the law, isn't he?
Well?
Tie him up.
And let the law find him when the Flyer pulls into Washington.
Hot java!
Coffee! Hot java!
Anybody want hot java?
Coffee!
Paper!
Boy! Boy, I want a paper!
Paper! Paper!
Is it war?
No, ma'am. It's Baltimore.
Anyone want a hot chocolate?
What are they doing to our train, conductor?
Nothing to be upset about, ma'am.
You can't run a locomotive through the middle of Baltimore.
The engine smoke dirties the laundry.
So the women passed a law.
Now we do it this way.
It's perfectly ridiculous.
And I mean to bring it to the attention of Mr. Lincoln.
Who is it?
Fernandina.
- You weren't followed?
- No.
You met Mr. Kennedy here.
Good morning, Mr. Kennedy.
Is Mr. Kennedy waiting for a shave?
No. But the police may be waiting for him.
He's wanted in New York and Philadelphia.
They must've telegraphed ahead.
No need to worry about that.
The magnetic telegraph service between New York and Baltimore has been suspended since midnight.
Suspended? Why?
Telegraph lines down.
Lantern signals all night.
Something's up.
It's normal precautions.
Mr. Lincoln's train is due in from Harrisburg at noon as scheduled.
- Many federal troops in town?
- Oh, naturally.
Well, Mr. Kennedy had me guessing for a time last night.
But now everything's all right.
You say Mr. Kennedy turned in his full report on me?
And I thought he was a friend of mine.
He's a friend of Mr. Lincoln.
A personal friend.
Well.
As I always say, it's a small world
How does the razor feel to you, Colonel?
- Mighty fine. Mighty soothing..
- Good.
Ah, the decorations are very effecting.
I didn't know the people around here would be so glad to see Abe Lincoln.
Most of them are not.
The banners were the reception committee's idea.
Did they build a speaker's stand?
Not necessary.
He speaks from the rear platform of a private car.
It will stop across the square.
Good. Is everything ready?
At that building over there by the harness shop, fifty men have been selected.
And they will start a riot – three minutes after Lincoln's speech begins.
Three minutes after two.
That should draw the police away from him at least.
It might surprise some people to find their common barber has it in him, huh?
You've done yourself proud, I'd say.
I only hope that all of our friends are as well pleased.
Look at that uh... upstairs window in the hotel.
- The open one.
- Yes.
That window is where Lt. Beaufort will sit with his rifle until the proper moment comes.
He will have Mr. Lincoln in his telescope sight.
I saw to it there was a chair for him.
He will be quite comfortable.
There you are, Colonel.
A new face.
Lobsters! Crabs!
Lobsters! Crabs!
Lobsters, ladies.
There you are.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you. Thank you.
Crabs! Lobsters!
Crabs! Crabs here.
Boy! Over here!
Extra. Read all about it.
Who is there?
Beaufort. Let me in.
Did you see this?
Lincoln's speech in Baltimore canceled!?
Well, that can't be true.
My men are disposed and waiting.
It's true, all right.
"News of Mr. Lincoln's movements
"ceased abruptly after his departure from Harrisburg last night.
"It is not likely that telegraphic service
"will be resumed until he reaches Washington."
So they'll be war.
Don't be too down in the mouth, son.
Mr. Lincoln is a tall target.
There'll be another day.
It looks like somebody read your report after all, John.
I'll take care of Mr. Kennedy.
No. No.
You stay here and watch him until the train gets out of Baltimore.
Then get rid of him as you see fit.
And after that?
You might as well keep on going to Atlanta.
Good morning, Colonel.
This is one ride we won't forget in a hurry, eh?
I'm afraid not.
Ah! Mrs. Gibbons.
I hope Mr. Gibbons had a good night's rest.
Yes. Thank you.
Left face. Form a line.
Colonel.
I'll leave you here.
If you're in any further need of my services, you know where to find me.
There are only two trains booked through here today.
The Flyer and the Inauguration Special.
That's right.
The package.
What package?
They didn't hold the train in Philadelphia an hour and a half just to put that package on board.
They held it for him.
What are your orders, sir?
Let me through.
Robert! Robert!!
Robert!
Robert!!
See Mrs. Gibbons. Her husband...
See Mrs. Gibbons!
Her husband! Mrs. Gibbons! Mrs. Gibbons!
Foreword, March!
Where is he?
- Who?
- You know who I mean!
Who's in there? Open up.
What are you doing in here?
Where did he come from?
I'm putting him in your custody.
He's wanted by the police.
I know. How did you catch him?
- I can explain.
- You can explain nothing.
You've caused us nothing but trouble ever since you came aboard.
You guard him until I can get the authorities.
Lieutenant. We'll need your gun.
Certainly.
Sit over there.
No more of your tricks, Kennedy.
Don't worry.
I won't cause you any more trouble.
Let's hope not.
Pretty country.
Mr. Lance.
Where's my gun?
I haven't seen it.
Did you see it, Rachel?
- No, Mr. Lance.
- Are you sure?
Even if I knew where it was,
I wouldn't tell you, Mr. Lance.
How about a chew of tobacco?
Give me the gun, Rachel.
I haven't got it, Mr. Lance.
You're making trouble for yourself, Rachel.
Serious trouble.
I'm not afraid.
Lance!
Lance!
What is it?
What's happening?
This man is a dangerous criminal.
Kindly open the door.
But he's wanted for–
I trust you've not made him too uncomfortable.
Open the door.
You will please remain at this end of the car.
What I have to say must be said quickly.
And to him alone.
Your report to the War Department was received and acted on.
My employer Allan Pinkerton persuaded Mr. Lincoln to cancel his speech in Baltimore.
He is at present acting as his personal bodyguard.
And has taken every possible means to ensure Mr. Lincoln's safe arrival in Washington.
I gather Mr. Ward's package is one of them.
I'd give a hat to know what's in it.
Your testimony will be needed when the conspirators come to trial.
You've earned that hat, Mr. Kennedy.
And an official commendation too.
There is no E.J. Ward.
And that package is full of yesterday's newspapers.
You know everyone aboard this train?
I think I do.
The best night's sleep
I've had in months, Mrs. Gibbons.
You needed it.
Any news, Mr. Pinkerton?
The journey was without incident, sir.
Did ever any President come to his inauguration so like a thief in the night?
The village of Tamaru.
How far is it from the villa?
- Three miles.
And from Barcelona?
- Eighty.
Another part of the coast.
And there. That's the villa.
Right up in the top.
Is that the main entrance?
Yes. It faces away from the sea, through the courtyard.
There is another entrance on the terrace at the back of the house.
Up those steps.
And that window on the corner.
That's her bedroom.
Where does the path lead to?
- Down to the beach house.
Now call the villa. Just in case there's been a chance of plan.
I want Tossa 8241 please.
Thank you.
There is something I want you to see.
Very pretty, isn't she.
- Listen to this.
"Kimberley Prescott, the
South African heiress .."
"Returns this week to her villa on the coast of Spain."
"The tragic suicide of her father the diamond magnate McKenzie Prescott."
"Made headlines a year ago."
"Her brother."
"Amateur racing driver
Ward McKenzie Prescott .."
[ Telephone ]
[ Telephone ]
No. Miss Prescott has not arrived yet.
She will be coming later. She is expecting some friends to dinner.
Who shall I say is calling?
No change.
If they keep Spanish hours they probably won't leave until after one.
Goodnight, Kim.
- Goodnight.
Goodnight.
You know, I can remember the days when I used to send you to bed at seven.
Is it seven yet?
Oh, I'm dead, it's nearly one-thirty.
You know.
I hope those enthusiasts don't ring me up at dawn and want to go fishing.
Well, take the phone off the hook.
That's what I always do.
That's a good idea. I think I will.
We have a date for lunch tomorrow, haven't we?
Pick you up about noon?
- Yes, fine.
Are you sure it's not going to be too much for you?
Remember you came here to rest.
Will you stop treating me like an invalid. I'm perfectly alright.
And don't you dare be a minute late.
Goodnight, uncle Chand.
Is there anything else, Senorita?
No thank you, Maria.
Don't wake me in the morning.
I am very tired.
Si, Senorita.
Buenos noches, Senorita.
Goodnight, Maria.
[ Footsteps ]
[ Footsteps ]
Is somebody there?
Is that you, Maria?
Who is it?
Hello, Kim.
Who are you?
I think you know who I am.
I presume you're from one of the other villas and you've had too much to drink.
Wrong both times, Kim.
In any case you've got no business here.
Will you please go.
Will you get out of here!
Maria!
Maria!
Was that uncle Chand
I saw leaving just now?
You must hand it to him, getting this place opened up at such short notice.
It can't have been easy after so long.
Wonderful, the way he was foster uncle to the Prescott children over the years.
What do you know about it?
I never saw you before in my life.
Now, are you going or shall I call the police?
The same old Kim.
By the way, the magazines didn't waste any time either.
You're on the front page of this month's
International Society. Did you know?
"Kimberly Prescott returns to the Villa Del Mar."
The unhappy heiress and so on.
Nicely done. I thought it made a good story.
Or don't you agree?
Alright. You've had your chance to leave.
Now you can just wait for the police.
Hello?
This is Kimberly Prescott at the Villa Del Mar.
I want the police.
Si .. the Policia.
Comisario Vargas.
Senorita. Senorita, please.
Please begin at the beginning.
What has happened?
Please speak more slowly.
Huh?
Right .. I will come at once.
In a few minutes.
Villa Del Mar?
I see. I know it.
Senor Comisario?
Yes, my name is Vargas.
I'm sorry to bring you all the way out here. I know it is very late.
Never too late to be of assistance to a beautiful lady.
Where is this man?
- I can't get him out.
He simply refuses to leave. I was worried. I have valuable jewellery.
Oh, cut it out Kim.
What is this anyway? What in the world are you trying to pull?
If you don't mind Senor,
I will ask the questions.
I wish you'd take him away.
It's late and I'm tired.
Not too tired to enjoy a joke.
You know, you ought to be spanked for this.
Senor.
Come in won't you.
Senor, I am afraid I must ask for your papers. Credentials.
Alright Kim. If you want to play games, let's play games.
My International Driving License.
A letter of credit from the
Union Bank of South Africa.
If you have your passport, Senor?
- Of course.
I am sorry, Senorita.
But I do not like games in the middle of the night.
Games?
Perhaps you think you can make fools of the police?
What are you talking about?
This is absurd.
My brother is dead.
Dead?
I'm afraid I should apologize for my sister.
She has our father's sense of humour.
You could never tell what he was going to do.
Just a minute, Senor.
One thing at a time.
About yourself, first.
Yes, of course. Well ..
I just arrived from Johannesburg.
I motored up from Madrid.
Liar.
- I got to the house.
He's lying. My brother's dead.
- Senorita.
You don't understand.
My brother Ward is dead.
Dead men do not carry passports and credentials, Senorita.
Why do you insist on this foolishness?
In the middle of the night.
You will read about it in the gossip columns tomorrow.
The Prescott humour rides again.
Young heiress has her brother arrested.
To the great embarrassment of the local police.
I assure you, Senor.
There will be no arrest.
And no embarrassment.
And the local police.
Say goodnight.
- Please ..
Please, you've got to listen.
You've got to believe me.
My brother Ward was killed over a year ago in South Africa.
His car went over a cliff.
I even had to identify the body.
There was a funeral .. all our friends.
Newspaper stories.
Senorita, I would like to believe you but ..
I cannot ignore the facts.
After all, what can I do?
There is his passport.
His photograph.
Passport photograph.
When has anyone ever looked like their passport photograph?
Wait, wait. Wait.
You want photographs?
I'll give you some.
I've two photographs of Ward up in bedroom.
Senorita.
[ Spanish language ]
Maria, show him.
Senor.
How long is it since you saw your sister?
I am not his sister.
Not for over a year.
At least, not since the accident.
Oh.
So there was an accident?
Oh yes, of course. But I wasn't in it.
You see, I'd given a lift to a chap on the road that morning.
As it turned out he gave me the ride, with a knock on the head.
He took my wallet, chucked me in the ditch and drove off.
May I have permission to use my own phone?
Chandler Bridson, the architect.
You must know him.
He'll tell you who is lying.
Tossa, 3-1-1-6.
Senor.
If all this happened so long ago ..
I was still unconscious when they found me the next day.
I was in hospital for months.
Suffering from amnesia no doubt.
Well, it's all there in the hospital records if you'd care to check up.
It can't be.
Will you .. will you try again.
Excuse me.
Hello?
Comisario Vargas. Si.
[ Spanish language ]
Bridson.
Bridson.
"Hello .. hello, hello?"
"Hello .. hello?"
Oh.
Gracias.
The line is out of order. She says maybe the receiver is off.
Ah.
No.
No.
Don't you see?
He must have changed the pictures while we were having dinner or something.
He's taken Ward's pictures out and put his own in.
Wait. Wait.
I remember.
Ward had a small tattoo.
An anchor on ..
On this wrist.
Kim, I think Senor Vargas is getting fed up with this nonsense.
Would you mind, Senor?
Why don't you drop it for your own sake?
Stop it!
It is enough for one night, Senorita.
There will be no more of this.
If there is, I will have to arrest you.
And I'm not joking.
Now please don't be angry with her, Senor.
If I hadn't written when I was arriving she couldn't have planned all this.
I am not angry, Senor.
If anything, I am, how do you say ..
Intrigued.
She is spoiled, I suppose.
She's always had her own way.
And of course, she's very highly strung.
We have good doctors in Barcelona.
You must let me know if ..
It's caused us a lot worry in the past.
I quite understand.
Not everything mind you, but ..
Still.
Let me know if I can be of help.
- I will. Thank you.
Goodnight, Senor Comisario.
- Goodnight.
Senor Prescott.
There must be some way.
Please. Couldn't you just try once more?
Uncle Chand's line still out of order?
Too bad.
You know, I could use another drink.
How thoughtless of me.
I should have offered one to the Comisario.
I'm forgetting my hospitality.
You know, this is a beautiful room.
But then father never had anything but the best.
Why shouldn't he?
The king of diamonds.
You know, it's a pity I didn't spend more time here in the old days.
Why didn't you just drop in?
No, seriously. I should have made the effort.
Father would have appreciated it.
Yes .. I can imagine.
They say he always knew how to make the best of a diamond.
This place is a perfect setting for you, Kim.
Spain. The coast. This villa.
I only wish that father were alive to enjoy it.
But he's not.
There is just the two of us now.
Just you and I.
You've arranged all this very cleverly.
I don't know where you got your information.
But I see what you're after. I just hope you realize what a gamble you're taking.
You think you can keep this up for a few days.
So that no-one interferes when you help your sister dispose of her jewellery.
Isn't that it?
Here.
Here. Take it.
It's insured.
Take it and get out.
Kim dear, what's the matter with you?
The police have gone now.
The joke is over.
Remember this?
Three years ago.
The summer that you were ditched by that tennis player.
What was his name?
Murray Harris.
What do you want?
You are not my brother.
I know you are not.
My keys.
Are you looking for these?
You left hem in the car again, Kim.
That's a pretty bad habit.
Here.
Go on. Take them.
You are not a prisoner here.
But I sure you know it will be silly to run away.
I'd only have to bring you back and that might mean the hospital again.
Hospital?
I'm only going by what I've heard.
After father's death and the trouble with the company and everything else.
It was quite understandable.
Poor Kim. You've been through a pretty bad time.
Acute anxiety.
Isn't that what they call it?
No. No, I wasn't that sick.
I wasn't.
That's what you tried to make out but the doctors seemed to think you were.
And they'd think so again, Kim.
Ward's car!
The one he was killed in.
Of course I had her rebuilt.
Look, you've had a rough night.
Why don't you try and get some sleep?
Kim, your keys.
Senorita.
Would you try that Tossa number for me again please.
But I've got to get through.
I've been trying all night.
No. No, never mind.
Not important.
Not important.
Good morning, Miss Prescott.
I am Elaine Whitman.
A friend of your brother's.
Where is Maria?
Where's my maid?
She has gone to Barcelona for the weekend.
Ward said it would be alright.
I imagine she must find it rather lonely here.
This one does go on your table doesn't it?
How dare you come into my room!
Who are you? What are you doing here?
I've told you. I'm a friend of your brother's.
He is waiting for you on the terrace.
Oh, by the way.
He asked me to give you these.
I'll tell him you'll be down shortly?
Such a lovely day, Miss Prescott.
We don't want to waste it, do we.
Ah, good morning, Kim.
I hope you don't mind.
We've had breakfast already.
I believe you've met Mrs Whitman.
She'll be our guest for a while.
I'm sure you two will get along.
- I'm sure we will.
There you are. It's about time too.
You must be starved.
This is Carlos, our new butler.
I .. shan't be having any breakfast.
You see, I'm going out.
With uncle Chandler.
He is picking me up in about half an hour.
He should be very happy to see you here.
Oh, I's so sorry. I quite forgot.
Mr Bridson telephoned early this morning.
Before she left, Maria gave your regrets and said you'd be away for the weekend.
Some of your South African friends were passing through Madrid.
It was a chance to see them before they went home so you flew down to join them.
The telephone in the beach house.
It's alright. There is nothing to worry about.
Senorita.
Senorita, I reported this number was out of order last night.
Senorita, por favor ..
- May I come in?
Why bother to ask?
You didn't last night.
Ah, the spear-fishing equipment.
That takes me back a bit.
It used to be a lot of fun. Even though you were always better than me.
That's new. Where did you get it?
- In Paris.
Ward gave it to me the summer before last.
He picked it up in a little shop in Montmartre.
Really?
That's funny.
The summer before last I was in Rome.
With the Carters.
I haven't been to Paris for three years.
You don't forget a thing, do you.
I'm going to change.
Fix me a drink, will you.
Isn't it a little early in the day?
Oh, that doesn't sound much like a Prescott.
Well, I've had to watch myself since the accident.
What will it be?
Why Mr Prescott, I'm surprised.
My swimming drink, of course.
You know, it was years before I even knew that drink had a name.
To me it was just ..
Our swimming drink.
Remember the first time you fixed it for me?
My first big party.
I wasn't supposed to drink.
I was only sixteen.
And then you sneaked one out to me and we all went swimming.
It's funny, the little things that stay in your mind.
How is it coming?
Try it.
Not too much cassis?
Not too much soda.
No.
It's exactly the way Ward made it.
If on my theme I rightly think.
There are five reasons why I drink.
Good wine. A friend. Because I'm dry.
Or lest I should be, by and by.
Or any other reason why.
- Any other reason ..
You know our toast too.
Alright.
Ward McKenzie Prescott is back.
Why?
For the Prescott money?
Well there is not nearly as much as there used to be.
The Prescott name?
There is not so much of that left either.
The villa?
It's obvious you like it here.
You want the villa.
Lunch will be in 45 minutes, Kim.
No breakfast. No lunch.
I'm worried about her.
She'll eat when she's hungry.
If she wants to sulk, Carlos can take her up a tray later on.
We can't hope to keep her a prisoner here.
I've come to see Senor Bridson.
This is Senorita Prescott.
I am sorry. Senor Bridson is not here.
He must be.
I've been trying to reach him. You see, we had an appointment for lunch.
I am sorry, Senorita. Some of his friends from the hotel ..
They called this morning and he went away fishing.
I do not know what time he comes back.
Thank you.
But Senorita, we have laws.
I must go by the law.
That's all I'm asking Senor Vargas.
There must be some law to get him out of my house.
If the villa belonged only to you but after all, he is your brother ..
Don't keep saying that. He is not!
You thought I was joking last night.
It would have been a good joke wouldn't it?
To have had my brother arrested and put in jail at two o'clock in the morning.
Alright. Is it still a joke?
Why would I go on denying it?
What reason would I have?
Oh please. You've got to believe me.
You do not make it very easy for me, Senorita.
I would like to believe you.
Very much, I want to help.
Tell me something he has done.
Has he stolen anything?
Has he put his hand on you?
Has he threatened you?
No .. no, that's just it.
I don't know what he wants.
And I don't care.
All I want you to do is get rid of him.
After all, isn't that what the police are for?
Unfortunately, it is not quite as simple as you seem to imagine.
Look.
He is a foreigner.
He comes to this country with a passport and his credentials perfectly in order.
It would appear that he is rich and influential. Now, what do I do?
Throw him into prison?
Create an international incident?
Senorita.
There must be dozens of things that you could do. Records ..
Official records.
The death certificate.
The death certificate in South Africa.
The death certificate?
But Senorita.
It was you who identified the body.
Oh, I know what you're going to say.
It was Ward.
It was!
You want to believe what he says?
His passport.
His papers.
A lot of rubber stamps and photographs.
The could have been forged, you know.
- Certainly.
But why?
Senorita Prescott, why?
People with forged passports do not usually behave as your brother.
Or .. as this man behaves.
I had better tell you this.
This morning.
I made enquiries at the bank.
His letter of credit is perfectly genuine.
As a rule, banks are very particular about these matters.
So you see .. I am only being ..
Logical.
I must be.
It is obvious.
You have no intention of helping me.
I am very sorry I cannot be of more assistance.
I hope .. you will appreciate my position.
I deal in crimes that are committed, Senorita.
Not crimes that are .. imagined.
Crimes that are imagined?
Very well, Comisario Vargas.
We shall see.
You left your keys in the lock again.
I had Carlos take the Bentley home.
As a matter of fact it may not be a bad idea if you didn't drive for a while.
Until you get a hold of yourself.
The car feels sort of heavy today.
I must be getting out of shape.
At least you must admit I picked a good place to stop.
That's quite a view.
Well, you don't have to talk.
Would you like to smoke?
Where did you get that?
This ..
This cigarette case.
It was my brother's.
Of course it is mine.
My brother's.
I know. You gave it to me when I won the Rand Trophy.
I gave that case to Ward.
Now you're getting upset again.
No wonder this means so much to me.
That was quite a race.
One of the toughest tracks in the world and some of the toughest drivers.
Do you remember I used to stage my own races around here?
Almost four miles around the bay in three minutes flat.
Just for fun. Do you remember?
I was four years younger.
Four years crazier.
Ward could still do it.
Ward could do it now.
Kim.
Do I have to prove it to you?
I dare you.
Go on. I dare you.
What are we aiming for? Three minutes?
Three minutes flat.
Three-O-four.
Ah, I told you I was out of shape.
What's the matter, frightened?
You never used to be.
You meant to do this.
You meant to frighten me.
You had it all planned.
Oh now Kim, be reasonable.
It was your idea.
And you always said I could handle a car better than anyone else in the world.
Do you remember the old days
Kim, when I first started driving?
And father was so against it.
You were the one that always encouraged me.
Go on, I dare you.
They were good days, Kim.
The best we ever had.
We were both young.
We didn't give a darn about anything.
Company profits were hitting the skies.
Neither of us believed it would ever end.
Take me home. I want to go back.
What you really need is a drink.
Feeling better?
Let's just say I'm glad to be alive.
Well come to think of it, so am I.
Si, gracias.
Why did you do that?
Now don't be ungracious, Kim.
The Prescott sense of humour.
I can see you're feeling better already.
So let's talk, shall we.
Let's talk about diamonds.
And the Transvaal Company.
And Ward McKenzie Prescott senior.
No, Kim.
Not until we've talked about the diamonds.
Ten million's worth.
Stored away in the company vaults.
Stockpiled over the years.
Father's whole life.
We needn't go into the details of how the company crashed.
How the shares were bought out behind father's back.
But that wasn't why he killed himself, was it, Kim?
To listen to you talking about my father.
I was there. I know what happened.
What is it you want? All that happened over a year ago. It's finished.
Not quite finished, Kim.
Let's return to the time the new company took over. Can't you just imagine it?
They have control. They have the stock certificates in their hands.
But what they want to see is diamonds.
So they go to the vaults and what do they find?
Nothing. The vaults are cleaned out. Empty.
The biggest diamond haul in history.
Where are those stones now? You didn't sell them. What did you do with them?
I don't know what you say. The diamonds simply disappeared. Nobody knows where.
Nobody in the whole world.
- Nobody but you.
April the 14th, just after father's death.
You left Johannesburg for New York.
Your tickets were booked via London but you never got to London did you, Kim?
You left the plane at Cairo.
Cairo, Kim.
Remember?
Ward, Ward.
We have a visitor.
- Vargas?        - Yes.
And he's brought
Chandler Bridson with him.
You know what to do.
- Don't worry.
I know what to do.
Uncle Chand?
Uncle Chand!
Easy .. easy now.
Help me. Help me, uncle Chand.
I've been so desperate.
I tried so hard to reach you but I ..
They said you'd gone away.
- I know, I know.
Senor Vargas told me all about it.
Oh, it's been the most terrible nightmare.
I was ready to believe
I was losing my mind.
You are not to worry about a thing. I'm here now.
We'll soon find out what it's all about.
Uncle Chandler.
Ward.
It's true then.
Ward, my boy.
I don't know what to say.
I couldn't believe it.
What happened?
No, I don't care what happened.
Just so long as you're back.
So long as you're here with us again.
Don't worry.
Everything is under control.
What happened? We didn't expect you until tomorrow?
Vargas was worried about Kimberly.
When my telephone wasn't answered for so long he came to the house.
Did you have to bring him here?
Of course, I must pretend to be worried too.
I insisted on coming at once.
- Just a minute, uncle Chandler.
I think we're going a little too fast for Kim.
Yes.
Yes, you are a bit.
Particularly you, uncle Chand.
The last and only person in the whole world I thought I could trust.
I should very much like to know what's going on.
Yes. Yes, I think it is time you told her.
Why don't you sit down, Kim.
I will try to explain.
I'll get the file.
You see, Ward and I have kept a few notes.
Let's pick it up where we left off this afternoon.
We know that you flew to Cairo that day.
Perhaps you'd like to tell us where you went from there?
I went to the States.
I broke my journey because ..
Because I wasn't well.
I rested for a couple of days.
Then I caught the plane to New York.
New York?
Are you quite sure?
Of course. I tell you
I went to New York.
No you didn't.
Not until twelve days later.
What are you talking about?
Still about diamonds, Kim.
Those millions piled away.
You are all wasting your time.
Those diamonds are lost.
Nobody will ever find them. Nobody.
Anglo-Hispano Bank Ltd.
Tangiers.
That's where you went Kim, wasn't it?
Wasn't it?
Alright.
I did go there.
I admit it. I went to Tangiers.
The only place in the world where no-one can get at a bank deposit.
Even through international law.
But just in case you forgot, I signed the deposit slip for those stones.
And only my signature can get them out.
That's right, Kim.
Only your signature.
Come on Kim, you must have known you couldn't get away with it.
What on earth were you thinking of?
What are you thinking of?
Do you imagine you will get away with it?
Don't say you want to give the diamonds back to the Transvaal Company.
No, that's not the idea at all, is it uncle Chand.
This is quite hopeless. Why don't we let the police decide?
You wouldn't want that, would you Kim?
If I do what you want.
Will you promise to go away and leave me alone?
That's all I ask. Just to be left alone.
Come along, Miss Prescott.
All you have to do is sign this.
"Anglo-Hispanic Bank Ltd, Tangiers."
"This will introduce my .."
"My agent and brother."
"Ward McKenzie Prescott."
Thank you.
Mrs Whitman, see Carlos and tell him we'll have drinks out on the terrace.
Certainly.
Champagne, I think.
Champagne on the terrace?
That sounds rather pleasant, doesn't it.
Look, why don't you try to get an early night.
Have a good sleep.
You'll feel better in the morning.
What about you?
Aren't there things that keep you awake?
Tell me the truth.
You are not Ward.
Uncle Chandler believes
I am. Why can't you?
Because I saw him.
I saw him after he was dead.
Are you absolutely sure it was Ward?
How could I make a mistake about that? My own brother.
I heard you talking.
Did she have anything to say?
Not much.
Well.
What did you talk about?
Conscience.
She doesn't think that
I have a conscience.
Has she?
She is very pretty, isn't she.
I imagine she can be quite charming when she wants to.
Not too charming, I hope.
Carlos?
Mrs Whitman?
Carlos!
Mrs Whitman!
I heard you calling about the house.
I thought perhaps you might like some milk.
Do try it.
I'm sure it will help you sleep.
Is that you Carlos?
Si, Senor.
I have been to put the Bentley away but
Miss Prescott must have taken the keys.
She is learning.
That is not good, I think.
- Let me worry about that.
I worry too, Senor.
Carlos.
- Si, Senor?
Would you mind bringing out the B&B?
Of course, Senor.
You must be very much frightened, Senorita.
Now.
Perhaps at last you would like to tell me why.
I am sure it was not me you wanted to kill.
No.
Come, I want to know the truth.
People do not try to commit murder without reason.
Why do wish to kill this man?
Because .. he wants to kill me.
You don't believe me? You don't believe.
Look .. there is your proof.
He will make me sign it.
You see.
You see, it leaves everything to ..
My brother.
What more do you need?
Everything.
You mean the diamonds too?
The diamonds?
Belonging to the Transvaal Company.
You know about them?
Yes.
Every policeman in the world has read how they have disappeared.
So mysteriously.
Of perhaps ..
Not so mysteriously.
Senorita.
Was it you who took them?
No.
No it wasn't. I swear it wasn't.
Ward stole them from the vaults.
My brother.
My brother Ward.
You see.
My father was getting old.
And he was sick.
He was losing control of the company.
The diamonds were the last remaining asset he had.
And I knew if he found out that Ward had taken them ..
It would destroy him completely.
I tried to stop him from leaving the country.
I fought with him.
I begged him.
I did everything I knew how.
But he wouldn't listen.
He laughed at me.
Oh you.
You have to understand my brother.
He never thought of anyone but himself.
The only thing he ever cared about was having what he called a good time.
That and car racing.
We never saw him except when he needed money.
And now he was going to take what he could and get out.
And leave his father to look like a criminal.
And finally.
Finally, when he drove off.
I was desperate.
I didn't know what to do.
A little while later.
The phone rang.
There had been an accident.
His car had crashed.
He was killed.
I had to go to the hospital.
To identify his body.
Somehow I got through the formalities.
And then.
Then you see, they gave me his things.
You know, his ..
His bags .. his personal effects.
I was the only person that knew.
The diamonds were in his luggage.
So I .. I drove to the office.
And I thought.
If I could just get them back to my father.
You must have loved your father very much.
When I arrived.
The police met me.
And then they told me.
That my father ..
Had shot himself.
I guess I must have been very ill.
The doctors came in and out. I know that.
And then you see, much later ..
When I began to come out of it.
I realized.
I still had the diamonds.
Surely, the right thing to do would have been to go to the police?
I couldn't.
I couldn't go over all that again.
To explain, to answer questions.
To drag my father's name through the newspapers a second time.
So you ran away?
- Of course.
Where did you run to?
Yes, I ran away.
I put the stones in Tangiers.
And I went to America.
Tangiers?
- I know.
I know. It was stupid.
I know it was wrong.
I was just so sick.
I was half out of my mind.
And alone.
So you see, this man in my house.
He isn't Ward, He couldn't be.
Do you believe me?
Yes.
I will believe you.
But now, Senorita.
You must make a bargain with me.
What? A bargain?
I will help you.
If you will promise to return the diamonds.
To the Transvaal Company.
Alright. I promise.
Good. Now listen.
If this man is not your brother.
Then his passport, his credentials.
They are false, yes?
Yes.
For that he can be punished.
A long time in jail.
He is very clever, very thorough.
You've seen that yourself.
But for one thing.
His fingerprints.
Get the glass.
I came back for the brandy, Senor.
She was out here on the terrace.
What are you doing down here?
I was taking a walk.
Down by the shore.
At this time of night?
- I do it lots of times.
My room was hot. I couldn't sleep.
Alright, Carlos.
You can go. Everything is under control.
So I decided to have a drink.
Out of my glass?
I was taking your glass to the bar when Carlos frightened me.
I wish you'd tell him to stop sneaking around like that.
He frightened me half to death just now.
It's his job to look after the terrace.
At this time of night?
What were you doing up?
My room was hot. I couldn't sleep.
Maybe a drink would help?
No thanks. I've had a drink.
Well.
It .. seems a shame to waste it.
Dad's best B & B.
Please.
I hate to drink alone.
You're very quiet tonight.
And you don't talk much, do you.
Except about unpleasant things.
Is there anything else?
There could be.
Silly of me, isn't it.
Under the circumstances.
But if the circumstances were different.
If you weren't .. who you are.
Then what would we talk about?
What would you think of me then, I wonder?
This is pointless, Kim.
Yes, but it is rather fascinating, isn't it.
You're not fascinated.
Not in the least.
It is late, Kim. Time we locked up.
Carlos.
You're are being very naïve.
You've always had everything you wanted, haven't you.
An only daughter, a favourite child.
A rich father who thought you were just about perfect.
It's too bad he found out just before he died.
I ought to hate you more than anyone in the world.
Not half as much as I ought to hate you.
Excuse me.
I hope I'm not interrupting.
We were just having a drink.
With one glass?
Isn't two on one glass a little personal?
She has her own glass.
Where is your glass?
In your hand, Mr Prescott.
Can't you see the lipstick?
What happened to my glass?
I don't know.
I didn't know it was yours.
You put it right down there.
Where is it now?
Why ask me?
- Where is it?
I don't know.
I don't know.
- You are lying.
Let her go.
She must have had someone planted out here.
Nothing to worry about of course.
Only a crystal brandy glass.
With a lovely set of your fingerprints on it.
Who is helping her?
That's the first thing.
If we can figure out who's helping her.
- Someone she met today?
No, she wasn't alone for one second.
- Not this morning?
Wait.
Vargas .. I'll bet it was Vargas!
Nonsense. We've got him completely convinced.
She's talked him around somehow.
I don't know how but she's smart.
Sure. That's why she was down at the beach.
That's where they met.
And Vargas is a policeman remember.
He'd know about fingerprints.
Get her down here.
I'm not going to let him foul us up now.
Hello?
Hello operator.
What's the delay?
Hello?
I said get her down here. Come on, move.
And don't worry about Vargas.
I'll take care of him.
I didn't spend a year planning this thing for nothing.
Hello? Operator?
Operator, hello?
Operator.
Operator, this is urgent.
But that's ridiculous. There must be an open line at this time of the night.
Yes.
Well, keep on trying, please. In the meantime, get me Tossa 3-1-1-6.
Mrs Whitman.
Mrs Whitman!
She's not in her room. The door was locked from the outside.
The other rooms?
- I checked.
Well get Carlos to help you.
I've got to stay near the telephone.
And find her.
It makes no difference. Keep ringing.
Then wake him up. This is an emergency.
Well?    - We can't find her.
- The cars?    - They are both here.
She must be round here. Where's Carlos?
- Checking out front again.
Stay with it.
I'll be out as soon as I can.
Yes. Yes, I'm waiting.
Yes, but hurry please.
No sign of her.
You stay here. I'm going down to the beach house.
Hello, Kim.
Tangiers.
I'm sure you would like to give us your autograph now.
Sign it.
There. It's nice to get business over before breakfast.
The sea is nice and calm this morning.
What about a swim, my good Chand?
No. It's a bit early for me.
Mrs Whitman?
- No, I won't swim.
But I'll come down with you.
Well Kim, I guess you're my only hope.
What do you say?
You know, you might take a boat out.
You could do a little diving.
Yes, why not.
Kim?
I'm sure I can count on you.
You always loved to swim.
You'd better be careful taking Miss Prescott out there.
The currents off some of those points can be rather dangerous.
Oh, that's alright.
I shall be wearing an aqualung.
You are going to drown me?
Accidents will happen, you know.
Come along, Kim.
Wait!
Wait! Vargas is here.
They want to drown me.
They are trying to drown me.
I didn't think you'd ever get here. I had given up.
Senor Vargas. Good morning.
We were just going for a swim.
Yes .. a swim.
Let's go for a swim.
Ward.
My brother indeed.
His car, his picture his passport.
Even his tattoo on your wrist.
Oh, it's too bad you forgot one other little thing.
Tell him. Go on, tell him.
Tell him!
- I have checked the prints.
Senorita.
Your brother's prints in the records ..
And those on the glass.
They are the same.
No.
That can't be.
They can't be.
You've made a mistake.
I have been assured there can be no mistake.
I hope you will accept my apologies Senor Prescott.
Your sister asked for my help of course.
After all, I ..
I could not have known it was .. all in her mind.
No .. no. It's not in my mind.
He is not my brother.
I know he's not.
It is my fault Senor
Comisario. Not yours.
I didn't realize how sick she was.
He is lying. Don't listen to him. He's lying.
Now, it's alright.
You mustn't excite yourself.
No.
Help me. Help me, please.
They want to kill me.
They are not trying to kill you.
They are just trying to make you well.
You mentioned a doctor in Barcelona.
Oh yes. I will have you call him at once.
No, no! Don't go.
Don't leave me.
You can't leave me with him.
They want to drown me.
I will call the doctor.
The diamonds!
The Transvaal diamonds.
Out there on the terrace. On the table.
You can put me in jail. You can arrest me. You have to. You have to arrest me!
Of course they're out there.
I'll give her a sedative.
Wait!
He's .. he's not my brother.
Can't you understand?
My brother is dead.
I know he's dead.
Because ..
I killed him.
I killed him.
I killed him. I killed him.
I killed him.
I killed him. I killed him.
I did something to the brakes on his car.
I did ..
Barcelona 8360.
Your number, Inspector.
Hello? Is that Barcelona
Police Headquarters?
This is Police Inspector Williams.
Comisario Rojas, please.
I'm sorry we couldn't tell you until last night.
I had strict orders.
- You were only just in time.
You see, until last night I was on her side.
I know.
Comisario Rojas?
Yes it is. I am speaking from the villa.
We got a confession.
Would you send that cable?
We'll be along later.
Yes, thank you. Goodbye.
Kim.
I had to do it.
It was the only way I could stop it.
I fought with him.
Begged him.
I pleaded with him.
I followed him along the road.
I saw it happen.
If I ..
If I hadn't loved my father so much.
Oh, why didn't I stay with him, uncle Chand?
Why dîdn't I?
And now it is too late.
It is too late.
Miss Prescott.
* steve d *
- Here they come.
- What happened?
- Somebody get killed?
- Model on the fourth floor.
- Oh! I didn't...
- Who did it?
I hope the weather holds out.
Ed Cornell. Single room.
I made a reservation.
Oh, yes. Of course.
Will you register, please, Mr. Cornell?
Can't offer you much excitement around here, Mr. Cornell.
- Not this time of the year.
- I'm not lookin' for much excitement.
I just wanna sleep... for a week.
Well, it's very, very quiet here.
Boy! Boy.
I wanna talk to New York.
- Headquarters.
- Go ahead, 14.
Homicide. Go ahead.
Homicide.
- It's for you, sir.
- Who is it?
Cornell.
Ed, you're on vacation. I don't wanna see you around here for another week.
Chief, I'm comin' back.
I want that Lynn case.
Oh, now, Ed, look. You're knocked out.
You're overworked. S-Stay away.
You know my record. You know how many convictions I brought into that department.
I've never let you down.
I've never been wrong.
- You know I was never wrong.
- Yeah. Yeah, I know.
I worked in this department for 15 years.
I never let you down.
Ed, yes, I know your record as well as you do.
It-It's great, but you're not the only man in the department.
Have you read the papers?
- See what they say about the department?
- Sure. The papers are after us.
- Doesn't look fine on the records.
- I can read too, you know.
- I'm comin' back, and you can't talk me out of it.
- Ed...
- Are we gonna...
- It's my case!
- Ed, will...
- It's my case!
- All right. If you wanna kill...
- You can't talk me out of it.
- It's my case.
- I said, if you wanna kill yourself, okay.
- It's my case!
- It's your case.
I don't know why you're such an eager beaver about this, Cornell.
Pretty girl.
I don't like to see a pretty girl get knocked off.
Didn't think you ever looked at one.
- Suspects?
- Yeah.
The boys are talking to a couple of them now downstairs.
- Who's that?
- Her sister, Jill Lynn.
That's Robin Ray, the actor.
He took her out a few times.
There's a newspaper guy, Larry Evans.
He used to plug her in his column.
That's Steve Christopher, publicity man.
He gave her the big buildup.
This one...
This one's my baby.
- I didn't do it.
- You're a liar.
Why'd you do it?
I didn't kill Vicki.
- Why did you do it?
- He just asked me that.
And we'll keep on asking.
We know you did it.
We wanna know why.
- Anything?
- Nothing yet.
Might be different now that you're here, sir.
- Hello, Mac.
- Hi.
All right.
- There was another guy, wasn't there?
- You were jealous.
- No.
- She told you about him.
- You got sore.
- Then you grabbed her, hit her, killed her!
- No, no. No, no!
- Sit down.
- All right. Hold it there. Give 'im a cigarette.
Pretty boy.
That's better.
Now let's hear the whole story.
- I told it all once.
- Tell it again. Tell it to me.
- You wanna answer up, fella.
- How'd you meet Vicki Lynn?
Go ahead, Christopher.
Tell him.
I'd come from the opening night of a show... with Larry Evans, the columnist.
We were... We werejust walking.
Going nowhere.
Why do they call it a comedy? His wife hates him, loses his money. The kid steals.
- Brutal.
- Just brutal.
- I hope Robin isn't waiting up for the notices.
- Robin oughta get back... to those gypsy baron parts.
- As a light comedian, this man's nowhere.
- I'll tell ya one thing.
Good notices or bad, this thing's gonna run.
- Are you kidding?
- This thing's gonna run. You know why?
Robin's still a big draw in this town.
He's got what impresses them: a name, publicity.
Knockin' your own trade, aren't ya?
Maybe, but the point is,
I sold him to the public... and they'll go and see him.
- They like to see famous people.
- Whereas, me... sometimes I like to look at a completely new person.
- Nice. Coffee?
- Nice. Coffee.
Robin Ray's been sold to the public like any successful product.
- Like a brand of coffee.
- Well, who's to blame for that?
Well, the point is, it can be done.
You can sell 'em anything if you go about it right.
Then why waste time on a cornball like Robin Ray?
Well, that's simple.
He pays me.
- My job is to...
- Cream and sugar?
No, thanks. Just black.
We're in mourning.
- Saw a show, huh?
- In a manner of speaking.
You're lucky. Working nights, you never get to see anything.
Probably a frustrated actress.
Are you a frustrated actress?
Nope. No talent.
No ambition.
No ambition, huh?
You could do better than this.
- You're pretty.
- She's prettier than Robin Ray.
What's wrong with this?
It's my first job in New York.
They treat me all right.
I get Saturdays and Sundays off.
And tired feet. Haven't you thought about making a stab at something else?
- This lad could help you.
- Your coffee's getting cold.
Look, uh...
I'm gonna give you my address here.
Uh, this is my office.
And, if you're interested,
I wish you'd stop around sometime.
My card.
"Steve Christopher, public relations."
- Public?
- Strictly.
Well, thank you.
I'll put it in my file.
He means it. It's just his way of saying... that you don't belong in a place like this.
Sure. How many guys come in and tell you that?
You're the very first... tonight.
I never expected to see her again... but the next day she turned up at the office... and she was wrong about no ambition.
She was loaded with it... right from the beginning.
That night, I took her to the Club Capri to show her off to café society.
She did all right.
In fact, she was the toast of the table.
- Well, Edwina, Steve.
- Hi, darling.
There's someone here you simply must meet... Vicki Lynn.
- Hi, Vicki. We've met.
- Hi.
I'd gone on the line for some fancy clothes for her.
Well, it didn't hurt to have
Larry Evans show up... and make like he and Vicki were old friends.
Still, I had to admit that Vicki had what it takes.
- Tell us all the gossip.
- Why, you can read it tomorrow in my column, Edwina.
I know. He's afraid to repeat it in mixed company.
You're doing great.
You sure? Every once in a while, I have an impulse... to get up and clear the table.
Fight it.
- Oh, Robin Ray.
- Mr. Ray, hello.
- How do you do? Hello, Steve.
- Hello, Robin.
- Oh, hello, darling.
- Hello, my dear.
Well, Robin, obviously you're here for one reason. Miss Lynn, may I present...
Robin Ray, star of stage, screen and toothpaste endorsements.
- Hello.
- How do you do?
He looks even younger in person.
You know, Steve,
I could grow very fond of this girl.
- While you're growing, how about standing still for a picture?
- Wonderful.
I don't know if I was jealous of Robin.
Maybe I was already thinking of Vicki as my property.
Anyway, I didn't like his moving in like that.
So, I took care of the situation by moving Vicki out.
I asked her to dance.
Robin wasn't happy... but at that moment
I wasn't concerned about Robin.
I had plans for Vicki... things I wanted to discuss with her.
I didn't want Robin panting down our necks while we talked.
- You'd better be thinking of taking me home.
- Hello.
- It's almost midnight.
- Hi.
Say, midnight's never been a reason to go home.
Remember Cinderella?
This is all wonderful, but the ball's almost over... and tomorrow I'll be back clearing those tables.
You're wrong, Vicki.
The ball is just beginning.
Your picture in the paper with Robin, plugs in Larry's column... you're on your way.
And with me promoting you, well, you can be the town's top model... to start with, and from there...
Well, we'll see when you get there.
- Then last night wasn't just...
- A gag?
Maybe it was... then.
But promotion's my business, Vicki... and I know you can make it.
Oh, it'll be hard work, but it's yours... if you want it.
Of course I want it, Steve.
You said last night you had no ambition.
Last night, I didn't have you.
Then it's a deal?
Let's drink to it.
Oh.
- Nothing for me.
- A brandy, please.
Now, then, I want you to repeat after me.
- I, Vicki Lynn...
- I, Vicki Lynn...
- do solemnly swear...
- do solemnly swear... to wear the clothes, say the things, go to the places... and be the girl that Steve Christopher orders.
End of oath.
That Steve Christopher orders.
End of oath.
She was so nervous, she started to get up when Robin came along.
- Oh, Steve.
- No, no, no.
The price tag coming out of the glove.
That was the great touch.
Oh, stop teasing her.
She was wonderful.
- Thanks.
- Of course she was.
Harry, can I have my key?
- It's right there.
- Give the lady her key, Harry.
Thanks.
Well, Vick, brace yourself and get ready.
Tomorrow we launch the promotional campaign of the century.
Get used to seeing your name in the paper.
I'll make it a habit in the column.
I feel like Vicki Lynn,
Incorporated.
Well, meet the new stockholder.
Who let you into this corporation?
- I did.
- Mm-hmm.
She could do a lot worse than have her name tied up with mine.
- I don't see how.
- We'll take that up at the board meeting now.
Sorry.
Well, I wish I could ask you up, but...
But Cinderella has a cruel stepmother?
No. Cinderella has a sister... sound asleep.
Well, good night, and thanks for everything.
I'll be around first thing in the morning, Vick.
I'll be waiting.
Sister?
I hate girls with sisters.
But, in her case, you'll make an exception.
But, still, it could be worse.
Some girls have husbands, I hear.
And I know where you heard it... from their husbands.
Hey, how'd you like to give me back my magazine?
Sure, Harry.
- You had to get rough with the kid.
- I didn't get rough.
I just didn't like him.
Let's say you were quick-tempered... the way a killer'd be.
When his girl threw him over.
Ah-ah, that temper'll get you into trouble, Christopher.
- Then try talking sense.
- That's what you're here for.
What made you so sure you could make anything out of Vicki Lynn?
Look, promotion's my business.
She had looks. She was young. She had a good figure. What more do you want?
- I want the truth.
- You're hearing it.
Give it to me again and give it to me straight.
I'm checking everything you say.
- Has anyone done any talking?
- Yeah, the lieutenant.
- Vicki Lynn was your sister?
- Uh-huh.
How long have you lived in New York?
A little over two years.
- And your sister?
- Ten months.
She came here from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania... after Mom died... to live with me.
I wanted to see more of her, but I didn't.
- Why was that?
- Oh, she...
Well, you see, I work days.
I'm a public stenographer at the Wilton Hotel on 44th Street.
I work days, and Vicki worked nights at the cafeteria.
We just kept different hours.
That's all.
What do you know about Steve Christopher?
Well, not much... except that he was the one that gave her all those big ideas... about being a celebrity.
Oh, I know that was his business, but just the same...
When did this start?
Well, the first I knew about it was one night... when I'd brought a lot of work home from the office.
It got very late, and I guess I must've fallen asleep.
Vicki?
- Uh-huh.
- What time is it?
Oh, I don't know.
It must be late.
How's the job? Guys still peeking through the window at you?
They weren't peeking tonight, honey.
- They were staring.
- Well, I don't blame them.
Hey! Wha...
What is this?
- You like it?
- Well, sure. I love it... but I must be dreaming.
- What happened?
- Everything.
Compliments of the house.
I've been waltzing at the Club Capri... and I had my picture taken with an actor, Robin Ray... and Larry Evans, the columnist, sat right at our table.
And, Jill,
I'm gonna be a model!
- Oh, honey, you must be dreaming.
- No, it's all true... and I'm never going back to that dirty ol'job at the cafeteria.
What did you say?
I've been wasting my time, Jill.
I've just found out
I can be somebody.
Well, that did it. That woke me up.
Vicki, you can't be serious about giving up your job.
Sure I can. I was only waiting around for something better to turn up.
Men wanna look at me... let them pay for it.
Vicki Lynn, you've gone right out of your mind.
No. I'm using my head.
Besides, I'm not doing this all on my own.
I've got a sponsor.
If that means what it meant in Harrisburg, it's out.
Oh, no. Silly. Really,
I've got three sponsors.
There's Robin and there's Larry and there's Steve Christopher.
Actually, it was Steve's idea.
Well, just who is this Steve Christopher?
Oh! Everybody knows who Steve is.
He's a publicity man... a promoter.
Sounds a little bit to me... like he might be promoting himself to the head of the class.
Oh, that isn't it at all.
This is strictly business.
Vicki, come here. Honey.
Remember, when Mom died, we promised to look out for each other.
I don't wanna ever stand in your way or anything like that... but don't you think this is all a little sudden and foolish?
- Oh, why should I think that?
- Oh, honey.
Important people like this-this Steve Christopher... and the others, what do they want with people like us?
But, Jill, they're helping me.
- In what way?
- They're gonna make me a glamour girl. l- I know all this started as a gag... but, after the way things went tonight,
I know I can get to the top... and fast.
Oh, honey, sometimes things can happen too fast.
Your face can be on a magazine cover one week... and be in the ash can the next.
Oh, Vicki, dear.
I know I sound stuffy.
I don't mean to.
I just wanna make sure that you're sure.
You know, sometimes, when you get started on something like this... th-there's no turning back.
I know what you mean, Jill, but I am sure.
I've got the face and the figure for it.
Steve said so.
There's so many things I want.
Now I know how to get them.
Okay. Well, if it's the face and figure that are going to do it... we'd better put the bankroll to bed.
- Vicki, I think that man is here.
- Get it, will you?
I'm just putting on a dress.
- Morning. You're Vicki's sister?
- Vicki is my sister.
Well, I'm Steve Christopher, and, uh, you can put the weapon down.
- I'm harmless.
- I wonder.
- May I come in?
- Oh, by all means. Enter.
Thank you.
I'm afraid you won't find anything very elegant, but we call it home.
You know, most homes have a welcome mat.
I'll put one in when I'm sure it belongs.
- Look, if you're worried about Vicki...
- Why shouldn't I be?
You should see her. She's up in the air, she's quitting her job... and for what?
For this... just for a beginning.
Well.
Where are you in this?
Oh, I don't believe in that for myself.
- I'm not publicizing Steve Christopher.
- Mm. Modesty?
No, business.
- Ah, here's our glamour girl.
- Good morning, Steve.
- Morning.
- That's some dress you put on.
Oh! Look, it's me!
Mm-hmm.
And there's more.
Larry Evans's column.
Lead item.
"Vicki Lynn, a new face with that old magic."
Three model agencies after me.
Is that right, Steve?
No, but Monday there will be.
Five of them, after this.
Steve Christopher, you're a genius.
- Isn't he wonderful, Jill?
- The final vote isn't in yet.
From that day on, Steve Christopher saw to it that she was seen everywhere.
First it was just a few of the smart magazines... and then it was nearly all of the magazines at one time or another.
After that, it was subway posters... and then billboards... she was everywhere.
Steve Christopher didn't miss a bit.
In a few months, he even had Vicki singing at the Club Capri.
Steve worked hard for her.
I'll have to admit that.
And he protected her when she needed it... even while he was pushing her ahead.
Everything that pleased her seemed to please him... until one night about two months later.
There was an argument.
You don't have to stay if you don't want to, you know.
I've always liked fireworks.
I wanna be here when they go off.
Joe, pour me a drink, will you, dear?
- Make it two?
- No, thanks.
- Soda, Miss Lynn?
- No, just straight.
Why should there be fireworks?
They've got nothing to beef about.
- Steve especially.
- Why not let Steve decide that when he gets here.
I don't see why you're taking Steve's side.
- Unless...
- Unless what?
Unless, maybe you're in love with him.
- Vicki, how could you?
- I just said maybe.
But, if it is true, you oughta be happy about all this.
With me out of the way, you'll have him all to yourself.
- I'm going home!
- You'd better wait.
We've got company.
- Steve, darling!
- Hello, Vicki.
- Oh, Larry.
- Hello, Vicki.
- Hello, Jill.
- Hello.
- Well, what's the deal, Vick?
- You'd better sit down. You won't have so far to fall.
Well, something terrible's happened.
I don't know quite how to begin.
It's rather embarrassing.
I know you've both done so much for me... but, well, life's strange, isn't it?
- We're never sure what's going to happen next.
- What is gonna happen next?
- I'm going away.
- Where?
Well, I couldn't help it really.
I didn't ask them. They came to me.
- Hollywood?
- Yes, Hollywood.
You see, they wanted to give me a screen test.
I didn't see any harm in it, so I said yes.
I didn't want to mention it for fear it wouldn't pan out, but it did.
I was terrific! So, the next thing I knew, they had signed me up.
Mm-hmm. When are you going?
- Tomorrow night.
- Congratulations.
Me too.
Well, aren't we gonna have a drink on it?
All right. Joe, give me one.
We're all very gay, aren't we?
You'd think I just died or something.
Maybe you have.
Well, going to Hollywood isn't a crime, you know.
No, no. Of course not.
I said congratulations.
Well, then we're still friends?
Vicki, why didn't you tell me about this?
I know what you're thinking.
You gave me my start and all that... but it was me they were interested in.
I've got what it takes, and you didn't invent it.
Now I'll pay you back every cent you spent on me.
Vicki, I'm sure Steve's not interested in that.
I'm not interested in that.
That I have written off, and you too.
What I am interested in is some contracts
I have here at the club for magazines...
Who signed these contracts, Steve?
- Well, I did, but...
- Then you worry about them, darling.
Oh, brother!
Remind me not to hang around cafeterias anymore.
The things you can pick up there.
Sure I was sore, but not about the money... or even about the contracts
I was stuck with.
It was her ingratitude.
Nobody likes to be played for a sucker.
- So you killed her?
- No, wise guy.
I got together with Larry and Robin the next day... and we did what anybody would do.
We got loaded.
I'm going.
Robin, pay the man. It's your round.
All right.
Oh! Amongst my souvenirs.
"To Prince Charming from Cinderella."
To Prince same thing, from guess who.
Ditto.
I don't think there was ever any one man that Vicki took seriously.
She always used to say that there'd be lots of time to look around... after she got what she wanted.
When she was working at the cafeteria... did you ever hear of her having trouble with anybody?
The boss maybe?
Guys in the kitchen?
No, not that I can...
Wait a minute.
There was something queer that happened.
I didn't think much of it at the time, but... it was late one night, and I was sitting in the cafeteria... waiting for her to finish work.
It was just a few minutes before she left.
- I'll just be a minute, Sis.
- Okay.
- You ready?
- Oh, sure.
You've got an unknown admirer.
There was a guy out there really giving you the eye.
Oh, don't let it bother you, honey.
Everybody window-shops.
It doesn't mean a thing.
The next time I went there,
I saw him again.
He never said anything, never really bothered us... but... but it frightened me all the same.
I didn't mention it to Vicki anymore.
I knew she'd just laugh at me.
But there was something about him, something in the way he looked at her that...
Perhaps if you could find that man, you'd find the murderer.
Mysterious stranger, huh? You'll have to do better than that, young lady.
Why are you trying to protect
Steve Christopher?
Protect? I'm not trying to protect him or anybody. Why should I?
- You were in love with him, weren't you?
- That's a lie.
So much in love with him, you couldn't see straight.
- Only he didn't give you a tumble, isn't that right?
- No.
- But you fixed all that by eliminating the competition.
- No!
- Vicki seemed to think so.
- Didn't she say, "With me out of way... you'll have him all to yourself"?
- She didn't mean it like that.
- Still, that's what she said.
And she is out of the way.
You could've put her there.
Stop it! Stop it! Nobody has the right to say a thing like that to me.
Let me talk to somebody else.
Who's in charge of this case?
I'll get Cornell.
That's the way it was.
Each of us got a knife... right between the shoulder blades.
Lieutenant.
- You're wanted inside.
- Okay.
All right, miss.
Here's the head man.
Why that's him.
That's the man.
- Hmm?
- She says she saw a mysterious stranger... peeking through the window of the joint where her sister worked.
Now she says it's you.
How 'bout it, Ed?
Do you peek through windows?
Yeah. Sure.
If there's somethin' to look at.
Relax, sister.
That's my district.
That's my job, peeking at people.
Your sister was pretty.
A lot of people might have looked at her.
- No. This is the man I saw.
- All right. I'm a Peeping Tom.
Sit down.
Sit down!
Here. Drink this. You'll feel better.
Steve Christopher saw your sister and you once... after she told him she was going to Hollywood.
Whose idea was that?
Mine. Mostly.
After I walked out of the Club Capri,
I waited outside.
When Steve came out, I persuaded him to take Vicki and me for a ride.
I wanted them to square things off before she left.
What difference did that make to you?
What difference?
None, except I liked Steve.
I loved my sister.
I understood how angry he was with Vicki.
I didn't want him to do anything that would hurt her career.
I knew how much it meant to her.
What happened on that ride?
- They didn't get together.
- What was said?
- Nothing of any importance.
- Come on!
We-We just rode along the parkway.
He was still very angry at her.
Nobody said anything at all... for about 10 minutes.
I tried to bridge the gap.
Well, it's a nice night anyway.
I'm glad you're enjoying it.
This was your idea.
All right. I made a little mistake.
I'm sorry.
Your apology's accepted.
The case is closed.
Just like that, huh?
Look, Steve... to show we're still friends, how about driving me to the airport tomorrow?
Well, why not?
When you've been taken this far, you might as well go the whole distance.
Oh, now, Steve, that's not fair.
Ayear from now, Vicki'll be a big star, and then you'll be proud of her.
- Yeah. Hooray for Vicki.
- Three cheers.
I know what you're thinking.
You're glad to get rid of me.
I am? Why?
- AskJill. She knows.
- Oh, Vicki! Don't be silly.
Let's go back now. Shall we?
Now, Vicki said to Christopher,
"You'll be glad to get rid of me."
Is that it, word for word?
Oh, bu...
Sh-She didn't mean that.
What she meant we'll never know,
Miss Lynn.
O- Only what she said.
H- How and when did you find the body?
It was about five...
It was about 5:30.
I'd gotten home early from the office.
There was radio music coming from the apartment.
I just came in.
Just a second ag...
I was gonna take her to the airport.
Jill, you don't think that l...
Is she...
Operator, get me the police.
Thanks very much, Miss Lynn.
You've been most helpful.
- Well, I give up.
- You boys give up too easily.
We've only been here all night.
What did Vicki Lynn mean when she said,
"You'll be glad to get rid of me?"
- Where'd you get that?
- What did she mean?
- Why, she...
- I'll tell you what she meant.
She knew you hated her for running out on you.
You thought about her all that night and the next day... until you were so jealous you couldn't stand it... and then you went up to her apartment, but not to take her to the airport.
You went up there and killed her.
- That's not true!
- It is true!
I oughta kill you myself.
Pretty boy.
Hold it.
Lieutenant, the chief wants to see
Christopher in his office right away.
Take him with you.
You're ridin' him pretty hard, aren't ya, Ed?
- I haven't started.
- But why?
I've been in this game 15 years... and that's a guilty man.
He was found with her... with the body.
What do you want?
Come in.
Good morning, Mr. Christopher.
- I'm afraid we owe you an apology.
- Thanks.
- Sit down, please.
- Hello, Jill.
The fact is, somebody's made an unfortunate mistake.
I've just been telling Miss Lynn here that it seemed so logical...
- you were the guilty one.
- It did?
- What, uh, seems logical now?
- Sit down.
Well, now we think we know the identity of the killer.
A kid by the name of Harry Williams.
Switchboard boy at the apartment house.
We've just discovered he's been missing since 5:30 yesterday afternoon.
It's only a question of hours before we pick him up.
Well, that's a relief.
Did you hear that, Jill?
Yes. Do you mind if I go now?
- I'm not feeling too well.
- Not in the least, Miss Lynn.
I'm sorry to have troubled you.
Before you go, Christopher. I hope you haven't been too inconvenienced.
No, no.
No, not at all.
Jill! Jill, look, don't be like that.
We've both been through the same siege.
Shouldn't that make us friends?
- l-I don't know.
- Jill.
I'm sorry you had to tell 'em about that ride.
I'm afraid it didn't sound too good. l- I couldn't help it.
They got it out of me.
- Vicki didn't know what she was saying.
- Yes, I know that.
I tried to tell them.
Jill, can I take you home?
No. I'd rather not.
I don't want any reminders around... for a while.
What do you want?
One of these times, you're gonna talk.
You're gonna talk in your sleep.
When that time comes,
I wanna be around.
You got a warrant?
- Uh-uh. I'm doin' this on my own time.
- Then get out on your own time.
Get out.
You don't seem to realize
I'm doin' you a favor.
I'm keepin' you posted on the progress of the case.
For instance...
I found a cigarette butt in Vicki's clothes closet.
There was an evening slipper in there, too, with a crushed heel.
Somebody waited in there.
Do you smoke in clothes closets?
No, I don't smoke in clothes closets.
That's good.
That's very good... except it happened to be your brand.
Mine and 10 million more.
Maybe it was a mass murder.
I know it doesn't mean much by itself... but when I put all my evidence together...
I'll have you strapped in that chair so tight you'll scream.
Maybe I oughta keep you posted on this case.
They told me down at headquarters they know it was Harry Williams.
- I think they're wrong.
- Everybody outta step but you, is that it?
I've never made a mistake.
"To Steve. Thanks for everything."
Everything?
Well, Stevie... you want her all for yourself, huh?
First her and now her sister maybe, huh?
I'll bet when you were a kid, you wrote dirty words on fences.
- Don't try that again.
- I won't.
I don't want a hair out of place.
I want you spick-and-span for the chair.
- Get out!
- Stevie-boy, relax.
In the long run, it's not muscles that count.
It's brains.
Bring in those reports.
Come in!
Bring in those reports... on Robin Ray and Larry Evans in the Lynn case.
- You wanna see me, Chief?
- Not for long.
You're falling on your face, Cornell.
Now that Harry Williams is out of the running, you're back where you started. Nothin'.
I wouldn't say that.
Got my suspicions.
Well, that's just dandy.
I'll have the D.A.'s office make a note of it.
What do you mean, suspicions?
I thought you said Williams cleared himself.
Mm. I'm not talkin' about Williams.
- I'm talkin' about Steve Christopher.
- Christopher?
Christopher? All I hear from you is Christopher.
What about some of the others?
This ham actor here or Larry Evans.
Let's sweat him a little.
You'd better leave Evans alone until you get something definite on him.
He might give you a bad notice.
- All right, bring in the actor.
- He couldn't kill fleas.
Did I ask your opinion? I want him brought down here this afternoon.
All right, but you're wastin' your time.
- You mind if I bring in Steve Christopher too?
- May I ask why?
No special reason.
I just like to have him around.
Uh, please.
- Relax. Be like me.
- Thanks.
You got nothin' to worry about if you don't let the bulls push you around.
That way, they respect you.
Now, take me. I tell 'em off.
- They don't pull nothin' on me.
- Grubby.
- Yes, sir.
- We're through with you. Beat it.
Yes, sir.
- Robin!
- Well, what are you doing here?
Oh, I'm their favorite guest.
I think they'd like to make it permanent.
Of course, the whole thing is perfectly ridiculous.
I had nothing to do with it.
I only came here to be obliging.
Tell me, Steve. How do they go about these things? What do they do to you?
Robin, it'd spoil the fun if I told you.
Look. Look.
Slow down. Take it easy.
- You're not on trial here.
- Of course not.
- I hope.
- All right. This way.
After you.
Sit down over there.
Steve, what happens now?
I don't know.
This is new to me.
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
You can't do this! Let me get out of here!
Let me get out...
Bring 'em up to my office.
I couldn't help it. I couldn't stand watching her looking so alive... and knowing she was dead.
It wasn't fair to do that to Vicki.
When I first met her,
I went along with that publicity buildup.
She was just another good-looking girl, but... something happened.
I fell in love with her.
Then one day I told her, but she laughed.
She thought it was a joke... but I still felt the same way about her, even after that.
On the day Vicki was murdered, in the afternoon, where were you?
- I'm not sure.
- You had to be someplace... home, out for a walk,
Vicki Lynn's apartment.
- No.
- Where were you?
- I don't know.
- I do.
He was visiting a nightclub cigarette girl... in her apartment.
I felt foolish after she turned me down.
- I was trying to prove to myself...
- We don't need any details.
You can go now.
Thanks.
You're still it, pretty boy.
- Is that all for today?
- That's all.
For today.
- How 'bout a statement?
- No statement. Please, please, fellows. Let me go.
Hey, Steve, with Robin cleared, where does this leave you?
Ask Cornell.
He knows everything.
Tough lad to have on your tail.
- He's never been wrong, they say.
- He's never been wrong, he says.
- Say, Lieutenant...
- Not now.
Harry!
What are you doing here?
Well, I thought
I'd have this done before you got here.
I'm back working.
But l...
Put that down!
Ooh, you got me wrong,
Miss Lynn.
I just went over to see my folks in Newark for a couple of days.
I didn't know it was gonna cause such a stir...
- and I explained everything to the cops.
- But l... I thought.
You shouldn't have thought a thing like that.
You don't think
I'd do that, do you?
Well, do you?
No, Harry. I don't.
The superintendent told me you were coming back to get your sister's things... and I thought I'd have 'em packed for ya.
You shouldn't have done that... not without permission.
I thought it might help.
I didn't think you'd wanna do it alone.
Well, it's all right, as long as it's done.
Will you help me get these things down into the cab?
Oh, sure.
Just a second, Miss Lynn.
Hello? Huh? Yeah.
All right.
I was busy someplace else.
It's Mr. Christopher for you.
Tell him that I'm not in, that I've gone away.
She's gone away.
Mm. He wants to know where you've gone.
Say there's no forwarding address.
There's no forwarding address.
Boy, was he sore.
He says he's been ringing for 15 minutes!
Taxi.
- Was the funeral nice?
- It was very quiet.
- I wanted to come.
- Well, why didn't you, Harry?
- I didn't think it was my place.
- Harry, the doll.
Don't step on it.
Harry.
Good-bye, Miss Lynn.
Harry, thanks for helping me with the bags and everything.
I don't want your money.
- What do you want?
- A few questions.
You've asked enough questions already.
You wanna find the man who killed your sister, don't you?
- Of course I do.
- Maybe I can help you.
Maybe we can help each other.
We're after the same thing.
Nice place.
You can tell a lot about people by their books.
Good book.
- That Vicki's?
- Yes.
It's too bad she can't talk.
She was there.
You know...
I think you know a lot more than you're telling... especially about
Steve Christopher.
That's not true.
I've told you everything I know.
- What more can there be?
- If I knew that, I wouldn't be here.
I know what you're going through... but that guy played your sister for a sucker.
When she tried to run out on him, he let her have it.
- I don't believe that.
- You're in love with him.
- No!
- Yes, you are. I know it, and your sister knew it.
You're in love with him, and you're trying to cover up for him.
It won't work.
I'll get him with or without your help.
I'll get him!
He's guilty!
And you'd better play along with me.
- Get out! Get out!
- You keep telling yourself he's innocent.
But you're not certain, and that's what's drivin' you crazy.
You look up in his face. He puts his hands on you, and you like that.
But you think maybe they're the hands that killed Vicki.
- I haven't even seen him.
- I'd keep it that way if I were you.
Because I'm gonna haunt both of you... like a guilty conscience.
Steve Christopher, please.
Hello? Steve, this is Jill Lynn.
Look, are you free tonight?
I've got to see you.
Oh, good. 8:00.
Oh, that's right.
You don't.
It's 333 East 29th.
Good. I'll be ready.
What are you thinking about?
I was remembering the last time in here... when Vicki made her big announcement.
And I remember the first time... when she came home from here full of big plans.
- Steve.
- What?
What is it, Jill?
Were you... in love with her?
With Vicki? No.
Cornell seems to think so.
He... He came by to see me.
Cornell thinks something else too.
He's wrong... on both counts.
- You believe that, Jill?
- I want to.
Look.
Jill, l-I know it looks bad for me with Williams in the clear... but... I just have to ask you to trust me.
As for Vicki, l...
I know I tried to rush her too fast... into something that... she wasn't ready for.
But as for being in love with her...
Look, Jill, when a man loves a woman... he doesn't wanna plaster her face on every billboard in town.
He wants to keep her to himself... for himself.
Steve, I can tell you now why I called you.
There's something in the apartment... something of Vicki's that... that I want you to have.
Steve, I was going through some of Vicki's things... and l... I happened to come across this.
Hmm. "Bon voyage, Vicki.
After the way you behaved last night... the sooner you're out of the way, the better. "
That's the day she was leaving.
I sent her an orchid to wear on the plane and this with it.
I know what you meant by it, but I don't think anyone else would.
Why didn't you turn this in?
First I had to be sure about you, Steve, and now I am.
- Jill, l...
- I'd like to keep that.
Easy.
Now, pretty boy, let's try these on for size, huh?
Put those hands up there.
Put 'em up there!
That was nice of you to put it in writing.
You were holdin' out on me, weren't you?
Mona Lisa type.
This is real nice,
Stevie boy... you and me bein' alone like this.
- I've been lookin' forward to it.
- You're crazy, Cornell.
- You're tryin' to railroad me.
- Stevie, you bought the ticket.
- I'm just holdin' it for you.
- Anybody could've written that.
Anybody didn't. You did.
I found these in your apartment.
Exhibit "A"... a pair of brass knucks.
- You never found...
- Stevie-boy.
Vicki was hit behind the ear with a weapon about the size of a fist, only much harder.
- Remember?
- It's a frame! You planted those...
That's what they all say.
I got a cop saw me take these outta your bureau.
Did he see you put them there too?
I forgot to ask him.
Stevie, you shouldn't have tried to resist arrest.
Slug me with those,
Cornell... and I'll square you off if it takes me the rest of my life.
You're not gonna have a very long life, Stevie.
You're like a rat in a box without any holes.
But they're gonna make a hole for you...
6- by-3, filled with quicklime...
Steve. Oh, we've got to get out of here right away.
Your hands.
Do you suppose someone heard?
They must have.
These walls are so thin.
We've got to get out quickly.
- Is there another way out?
- Yes, upstairs. Quick. I'll show you.
Where can we go?
The police will be everywhere.
- I don't know. I have to think.
- You can't go home. They'll find you.
I have to figure someplace where no one will look for me.
- Is there...
- No, listen.
There's an all-night movie down on Lower Third... the Avon.
I could stay there tonight. Maybe... Maybe
I could think of some way to get out of all this.
- No, Steve. You've got to get away... out of town.
- No, no.
- You only run away when you're guilty.
- But if they find you...
I'll worry about that later.
I'm only sorry that you're in this.
Oh, I couldn't help it when
I saw you standing there so helpless... and that-that vulture bullying you.
- Yeah. "Vulture's" the word for him.
- Vicki called him that.
He infuriated me so much that I just had to strike out at something.
Was that the only reason?
- No.
- Jill.
Vicki was right about us.
- We can cross over to the other roof.
- I have to get rid of these.
There's a repair shop where I park the car sometimes.
There might be a hacksaw there.
You take the car. The keys are in it.
- Can't we be together?
- No, we can't.
- Oh, Steve.
- Our chances are better if we separate.
The place is at 64th Street and the river.
It closes at 11:00.
Meet me there at midnight.
- I wish there was something I could do.
- Don't look so worried.
You'll have to help me cut these off.
Are you handy with a hacksaw?
All right, go ahead.
I'll follow you.
Homicide.
This is Cornell. I want an alarm sent out forJill Lynn and Steve Christopher.
They may be in his car.
Check the number.
Just pick 'em up!
That's all!
I'll have a charge on file when you bring 'em in.
Young lady!
Young lady!
All right, all right.
You're coming with us.
Where's the man?
Where's Christopher?
You're too late.
He's left town.
- Hiya, Lieutenant.
- Where's the man?
- She says he left town.
- He won't mind if we use his car.
Let's go. Get in the car.
We're goin' downtown.
- Keller, take a look around.
- Okay. Barr, come on.
I guess she told the truth.
He isn't here.
Let's go, huh?
- Blake.
- Yes, Ed.
- Anything on Christopher?
- Nothin' yet.
- You know they picked up the girl?
- Yeah, they told me.
- You wanna see her?
- I don't wanna see anybody but Christopher.
I want him picked up.
If he tries anything, let him have it.
Okay.
Ed, you look awfully beat.
If anything comes up, we can phone you at home.
Yeah.
Yeah, do that.
I'll call it a night.
Oh, good morning, Ed.
Here's the stuff on Jill Lynn.
I made it assaulting an officer.
We can write our own ticket later.
Mac, you ever read a book on butterflies by a guy named Fabre?
Not being a butterfly,
I was never interested.
- Now, if you'll just sign these.
- This Fabre was a naturalist.
Once he got hold of a very rare female butterfly worth a thousand bucks.
He kept it in a glass box.
But what he really wanted was the male of the species.
Nobody'd ever been able to capture one.
- You know what he did?
- Advertised.
Mm-mmm.
He turned the female loose.
In 24 hours, he had the male in a net.
- You get the point?
- A house doesn't have to fall on me.
Turn Jill Lynn loose, and we'll have Christopher in 24 hours.
If this doesn't work, the chief'll pull the rug out from under you.
Turn her loose!
You're the boss.
What are you trying to do, force a confession out of me?
You've been holding out, and I want to know why.
It'll be easier for you if you tell the truth.
What difference does it make what I say?
- In your mind, I'm guilty.
- Are you?
- Don't tell me you have any doubts?
- This seat isn't taken, baby.
Ken, please, do I have to have those lights in my face?
Jill.
Thanks.
Wait.
Quiet. Quiet, please.
Steve, I was so afraid
I wouldn't find you.
I'm sure glad you did.
I've seen this picture four times.
You know who killed
Lady Batterslee? The butler.
Did you find out anything?
Did you get anywhere?
I've been checking all afternoon.
Couldn't dig up a thing.
- Well, listen. I think I may have.
- What?
I'm not quite sure what it means, but I thought you might.
I found these.
They're cards the florist sent me.
They were on flowers sent to Vicki at the cemetery.
There's six of them with the same message...
"Because I promised."
"Be-Because I promised."
"Until tomorrow."
Jill. That's the way
Larry Evans signs off his column.
- Larry Evans?
- Uh, may we have a little bit of quiet, please?
- Some of us are trying to enjoy the picture.
- Come on.
- I wanna talk to you.
- I don't mind people dropping in.
But some other time, huh?
I got a column to turn out.
- What do you know about Vicki's murder?
- What I read in the papers.
- What do you know?
- I know this.
You've been sending flowers every day to her grave.
Oh. So you found out about that, have you?
It's easy to explain.
I promised her.
- Promised her?
- Uh-huh.
Let me get a cigarette.
Just thought I'd try it.
Make a good story if I could bring you in myself.
Swell. What do you mean you promised to send Vicki flowers?
It was like this. On the day of the murder, after I'd taken her down to pick up...
Wait. You were with Vicki the afternoon she was murdered?
- Sure.
- Why didn't you tell the police that?
You told them your story.
Look what it got you.
Never mind. Go on.
When we got back to her place, she found out she'd forgotten her key... so we went to the desk to pick up the passkey.
The passkey wasn't there, and neither was the kid who ran the switchboard.
I give up. We'll just have to wait around till Harry gets back.
From what I've seen of that boy, he could be gone for hours.
Tell you what...
I'll climb up the fire escape and let you in.
Oh, Larry Evans. You'd never do anything so gallant.
Oh, no?
Where is it?
Down the corridor, I think.
I'm an old fire escape man from way back.
I get most of my items that way.
We were expecting you,
Your Ladyship.
Oh. Larry, you're a doll.
You know...
Now that I'm going away, l...
I really feel a little sad.
- Forget it.
- If I didn't think I'd be a success...
I'd never dream of doing a thing like this.
You'll make it.
You've got a heart made out of rock candy.
- You won't forget me, will you?
- Not for at least two weeks.
Two weeks isn't a very long time, do you think?
It is for a columnist.
Listen, I'll do you a favor.
For the first two weeks,
I'll send you flowers.
It'll make a big impression out there where you're going.
Oh. That'd be terrific.
- You promise?
- Promise.
I promised her.
A promise is a promise.
I hope it still makes an impression wherever she is.
Besides, I thought it'd make a great Sunday column.
- What happened after that?
- I left.
Was the kid back at the switchboard when you went downstairs?
No. I remember the board was buzzing as I passed by.
That's odd... gone so long.
Was there anything unusual about the apartment when you went in?
Yes, now that you mention it.
There was cigarette smoke in the bedroom.
- I thought maybeJill had just left.
- Jill was still at the offi...
Wait a minute. l...
I remember she told me, when she went back to get Vicki's things... there was a cigarette burning in...
Thanks, Larry.
Stand still, Mac.
Put that gun away.
We got enough on you as it is.
Not till you hear me out.
I've got a line on the real killer, but I need your help.
Sorry, Steve. I'm on the other side of the fence.
Okay, I'll make you a proposition.
If you'll trust me for just half an hour, I'll trust you.
Well, I guess half an hour won't do much harm.
But, just in case,
I'll take this.
Yeah?
Hello. Harry? This is Vicki.
Why did you do it, Harry?
Didn't you love me?
Tell Vicki.
Please tell Vicki.
Hello?
Tell Vicki.
Please tell Vicki.
Why did you do it, Harry?
Didn't you love me?
Tell Vicki.
Please tell Vicki.
Tell Vicki.
Why did you do it, Harry?
- Didn't you love me?
- I can't!
Why did you do it, Harry?
Come on. Let's have it.
- Go away! Go away! Leave me alone!
- You loved her, didn't you?
I won't tell you!
I won't tell you!
You let yourself into her apartment with a passkey, and you waited for her.
When Larry Evans came through the window to let her in, you hid in the closet.
- After Evans left, you came out and you tried to grab her.
- No!
She screamed, you got scared, and you hit her with this!
No! I didn't know what I was doing! I swear!
When she screamed,
I got scared.
- I didn't know! I didn't know!
- Sure, sure, sure.
- I understand.
- Do you? Do you?
Sure, Harry.
I told the cop how it was when he traced me to Newark.
He said he understood too. He said he understood how anybody would want to kiss her.
He told me just to come back here and to keep quiet. It'd be all right.
- He said he'd forget all about it.
- What cop?
- Th-The big one.
- Ed Cornell?
Yeah. Yeah, that's his name.
You understand, don't you?
- It's all right, isn't it?
- Yes, Harry. It's all right.
Come on. Let's go.
Come on, come on.
Did you hear that, Mac?
He knew I was innocent all the time.
Come on down, Jill.
He confessed.
Oh, Steve.
Thank heaven.
I'll be right down.
Mac, I'm gonna ask you one more favor.
Five minutes alone with Cornell.
Okay. I guess you got it comin' to you.
But exactly five minutes after you get there...
I'll be around.
Thanks.
You come here to give yourself up?
I don't have to.
I just had a talk with Harry Williams.
Yeah. It must have been very enlightening.
It was. Very.
You're a sick man, Cornell.
- You knew all the time it was Harry Williams.
- Sure. I'm not dumb.
- You knew it, and yet you wanted to hang it on me.
- That's right.
Why? Why didn't you go after him?
He was the one who killed her.
Vicki was dead for me from the time you set eyes on her.
You're the one who really killed her.
You're the one who took her away from me. Not him.
Don't make me laugh, Cornell.
You never had a chance with her.
Yeah. I guess... it must seem funny to you... a worm like me looking up to a woman like that.
I used to hang around that cafeteria at night... just to be sure she got home safe.
She seemed... really grateful, friendly.
We had a cup of coffee together.
I guess a cup of coffee's... not very much to... hang your hopes on... but I didn't need much.
I started to hope... hope we'd get to know each other better.
I might even get up enough courage to ask her to marry me someday.
I took this apartment and st-started to furnish it with... things I thought she'd like.
I was gonna surprise her with it.
Then you came along, put big ideas in her head.
She was a glamour girl.
Why didn't you leave her alone?
Nobody took Vicki away from you, Cornell.
She hated you for the way you were always watching her and following her.
- She used to call you "the vulture."
- No.
This is the end of the line, Cornell.
They're gonna put you away.
I oughta kill you for what you've done.
Yeah, Stevie.
Stevie, you do that.
You... You kill me, Stevie.
- I could be with her then. I'd like that.
- You're crazy.
- You do that.
- You're through, Cornell!
You hear what he said?
You hear?
Now there won't be anyone to change the flowers now.
Steve.
Come on, Ed.
As I was saying...
Good morning, kids.
Now at this point you bring the music up, up... up, up, up to a crescendo.
Up.
There now. This is where i make my entrance.
Now, from here on, pianissimo, keep it under while I talk.
Softly, softly, softly. That's right.
Ladies and gentlemen, magic is the science of illusion, the art of misdirecting thought.
So if you will try and keep your thoughts on what I am doing, l'll...
There. That's fine, fine.
Sorry, sir. They're rehearsing inside.
No visitors.
But this is something special.
I have a lady friend in the show.
No smoking.
Oh, I'm sorry. I promised her
I'd be here for the opening
- miss Karen Lee?
- Miss Lee? Oh, yeah, yeah.
The little one with the legs.
Don't tell me you've never noticed them.
She's cute. Miss Lee!
Miss Lee. A gentleman to see you.
Alan. You got here after all.
You didn't think I'd miss your opening.
How's it going?
Like they always go with a new show.
Oh, I want you to meet Mr. gallico.
No, no, look, i don't want to bother him now.
Oh, it'll do him good.
Make him forget his nervousness.
You'll like him.
Gus. Be sure that entrance is kept clear for the buzz saw trick.
- Remember, it's got to be rolled on in the dark. - Mr. gallico?
I'd like you to meet lieutenant Bruce of the New York detective bureau.
- How are you? - He came all the way from New York to see our opening show.
I can see how busy you are, all this excitement.
Yes. Lt's especially exciting for me, lieutenant, since this is my first appearance on any stage.
But Mr. gallico knows more about magic than all the other magicians put together.
For years I've been inventing illusions for big-name magicians and watching them take all the bows.
Well, I finally caught the fever myself.
L'm like the playwright who wants to get in there and read his own lines.
- I guess I'm just a ham at heart.
- Who isn't?
So I put this show together, and if our luck holds out, we're headed for Broadway.
Pardon me, please.
Mr. gallico, we're ready to rehearse the buzz saw illusion.
L've sent out everybody who doesn't have a part in it.
Good. Pull that curtain down, and be sure the stage door is kept locked.
Right.
That trick is the secret of our show.
You see, lieutenant, no magician considers it a crime to steal from a competitor, so we carefully guard all our new ideas.
This buzz saw trick of mine is a prize shocker, and I'm taking no chances.
We don't even trust the police.
She doesn't mean you, lieutenant.
You don't have to go.
I think I'd better. I'll be rooting for you tonight. Good luck.
Thanks so much.
All right, now be sure that stage door is locked.
All right.
This trick can put us over on Broadway.
It all depends on how it's done.
- L've made it as foolproof as possible, but that saw is dangerous. - it can rip its way through anything short of steel.
All right, boys, take it from where we place Karen on the table.
Excuse me, Mr.-
I didn't recognize you, Mr. gallico.
Is it really that good?
Do I look like Rinaldi?
Like his twin.
I don't know. This is the first time any magician has ever attempted an impersonation of one of his rivals.
Holy smoke! That's the end of their act.
Mr. gallico, you're on.
L'm ready.
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. gallico, who is a talented mimic, will now present several of his own illusions as they would be done by other famous magicians.
First, the great Rinaldi.
Ah, how cooling it is.
This is one convenience we do not have in my place.
Let us have some more, please.
He not only looks like Rinaldi, but he sounds like him.
Was I all right?
You were great. Just listen to them. They loved you.
- Did I sound like Rinaldi?
- Exactly like him.
All right, Karen, the buzz saw trick is next.
Now, remember, that trick is the high spot of our show.
- If it's a hit, we're in. If it's a flop, we're dead. Good luck. - Good luck.
Ladies and gentlemen, first, a demonstration.
I have here a common newel post, cut from a solid piece of mahogany.
Hey. Where are you going?
- L'm Ross ormond.
- Shh. There's a show going on.
L'm Ross ormond.
I want to talk to the house manager.
Well, he's out front.
They said he was back here on the stage.
This is police business.
Oh, all right. L'll see if I can find him.
Wait down there.
Wait down there.
Now, let us assume that this is a human body, and that this is a human head.
Ladies and gentlemen, this is the most dangerous exhibition ever attempted, and I must ask for complete silence.
The least disturbance could cause this experiment to end in tragedy.
So now, I present for the first time on any stage,
“the lady and the buzz saw.”
- who pulled the curtain down?
- Get that curtain up again. Up.
Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention, please?
I wish to announce that owing to unforeseen circumstances, we are unable to continue with this performance.
What does he mean “unable to continue”?
Ladies and gentlemen, please.
What were you talking about out there?
How dare you pull down on me.
Ask those men.
They'll tell you.
And I'm holding you responsible for the loss on tonight's business.
L'm calling my lawyer right now.
What does he mean, “ask you”?
He means I rang down the curtain, with an injunction.
An injunction against what?
The use of the buzz saw trick.
But what right have you to...
Lieutenant, do you know anything about these things?
A little, yeah, but I'm no lawyer.
This theater is enjoined against showing your buzz saw trick.
L'm afraid they've got you.
What's it all about?
Well, if it's any of your business,
I own a company that builds illusions for magicians, and gallico is my employee.
Anything he creates becomes my property.
But I built the buzz saw trick on my own time and with my own money.
Read your contract. No matter how you built it, it still belongs to me.
Why you rotten, low-down...
No, Mr. gallico, that won't get you anywhere.
It'll get him locked up in the cityjail.
Now, listen, you.
I want this trick back in my
New York studio before noon tomorrow.
And if you know what's good for you, you'll quit playing actor and get back on your job.
Do you think
I'd work for you after this?
You'll work for me, or you won't work.
So long, gallico the great.
This is a tough contract you signed with ormond.
Is it true that he owns everything I create?
According to this, everything but the air you breathe.
Can the contract be broken?
I doubt it.
But I told him at the time that I would take care of this business as long as my show was in New York, or... or until he could replace me, and he offered no objections.
But that's his way, to say nothing and then stab you in the back.
L'm sorry. I...
I don't often forget myself like that.
I understand ormond's a big man in show business.
Yes.
I had my show all set for the 44th street theater.
They told me this morning that they'd booked another attraction.
I can thank him for that.
L'm afraid I have to go.
I thought Karen was meeting you here.
She's supposed to, but she's late.
I have an appointment at the Hudson university lab.
They're doing some pathological work for the department.
Make my excuses, will you?
Of course.
Hi, don.
Hello. You've met Mr. ormond.
- Yes.
- Lieutenant.
And I'm sure you've heard of Mr. Rinaldi, the great Rinaldi?
Master of the black arts.
Magician by royal appointment to the court of the king of Spain.
L'm sorry. That's his billing.
Next week, Jersey city.
Meet lieutenant Bruce, of the detective bureau.
A detective. Lt's a pleasure.
I trust it remains a pleasure.
L'm glad to know you,
Mr. Rinaldi.
- Excuse me. I was just leaving.
- L'll tell Karen.
Please, and tell her I'll meet her for dinner at Tony's restaurant, 6:00.
- So long.
- Thanks.
Ah. The mysterious buzz saw.
It looks very real, very dangerous.
It's no wonder you kept it a secret.
Go ahead, don.
Show him how it works.
He's a magician.
He should know how it works.
The girl's body drops through the trap.
Then, when you pretend to fix her hair, the dummy head comes up, and the real girl slips out of the machine.
Very good. But it needs a showman to present it to an audience.
It was presumptuous of you to think you could do it.
Only an amateur could be so brash.
But I'll make you famous, my pet.
In my hands you'll become a star.
Now, look, I'll send a moving Van to pick it up this afternoon and deliver it to me.
L'm bringing my show to the 44th street theater next month, and I want to start rehearsing this trick.
I'll give it top billing on all my posters.
The 44th street theater.
Of course.
Ross owns half interest in my show.
Well, I have a matinee in Jersey city.
- Good-bye, Ross.
- Good-bye.
Good-bye, gallico the great.
So that's why you took the trick away from me.
I could have stopped you before you booked your first date.
But why didn't you?
Why did you let me go on?
You needed a lesson.
You belong here, not in the theater.
When I stumbled onto you, you were a two-bit concessionaire with a broken-down carny outfit.
All you had was a leaky tent and a bag full of cheap tricks.
I had a lovely wife.
She was the only reason I took a second look at your flea-bitten show.
The only reason you brought me here and gave me a job.
She was a lot different then.
For one thing, she had an innocent mind.
But to you, that meant ignorance, and so you did your best to change it.
She had one great weakness, a consuming hunger for rich living, and I couldn't give her that.
If you'd left us alone, she might have gotten over it, but you catered to it, built it up.
I could see her change before my eyes.
It was no surprise when she asked me for a divorce.
You seemed willing enough.
She didn't try to deceive me.
She told me what she wanted, and I let her have her way.
It couldn't have bothered you much, or you wouldn't have stayed here onthejob.
I loved her, Ross.
Oh, yeah.
That's funny, isn't it?
Yes, it would be, to you.
I knew you, even then.
I knew what could happen.
I stayed on the job to pick up the pieces.
You're lucky i took her off your hands.
Look how she's behaved since I've married her.
Gallivanting all over Europe, spending my money like water.
I haven't seen her in six months.
“Didn't try to deceive you”?
You stupid fool.
She's always been a trollop.
She double-crossed you from the first, just as she double-crossed me.
Don. don, what's the matter with you?
Keep away from me.
You took everything.
Everything I ever had.
My wife! My brains! My self-respect!
Everything but the air I breathe.
“Gallico the great, magician extraordinary.” that's funny, isn't it?
Gallico the clown.
Gallico the stupid fool.
There's one trick you've never seen, Ross.
That no magician has ever dared to try.
But I can't do it alone.
You've got to help me.
In fact, you'll be the star.
- don. Stop it! Don't! - Gallico the great, the magician extraordinary.
- Why don't you laugh at me now?
- Don, the blade.
- Go on! Laugh!
- Don, the blade!
Laugh! Laugh!
Go on! Laugh!
You crazy murderer.
- Laugh! Laugh!
- Murderer! The blade!
- Laugh! Laugh!
- Don, the blade!
"Lau9h! Laugh!
- don! don!
Laugh! Laugh!
Laugh!
Who is it?
It's Karen.
One moment, please.
Hello, don. Ls Alan here?
No. He couldn't wait.
He had an appointment.
Oh, dear. I know I'm late, but I couldn't help it.
I got a job today, working at Siegel-Cooper's store.
Oh. Alan said he would meet you at Tony's restaurant at 6:00.
It's almost that now.
Karen, I want to make you out a check for the time you spent in rehearsal and two weeks' salary in addition.
Oh, well, forget it, don.
I know what this thing has cost you.
No, I want you to have your money, the same as the others.
If there's any change in my plans,
I'll let you know.
Look, don, why don't you come to dinner with us tonight?
It'll do you good.
No, thanks, Karen, but I have something else to do.
Good night, Karen.
Good night, don.
Illusions, incorporated.
Yes, this is Mr. gallico.
Who is this, please?
Dean's Van and storage?
Yes, I have a consignment for Mr. Rinaldi.
I'll be here tonight.
I'll have it ready for you.
Karen.
- Hello there.
- Hello.
Don, you changed your mind.
Karen, you left your bag at the studio and took mine by mistake.
There's something in my bag that's very, very valuable. Where is it?
Oh. don, I...
What's the matter?
What have you done with it?
I left it in the cab.
In a cab?
Do you remember the driver?
No, it was just a hansom cab.
It's all right. The driver will turn it over to the police.
Waiter, bring my check.
- Did you bring a young lady to this restaurant? - Nope.
- How long have you been here?
- About a quarter of an hour.
Did you see a hansom cab leave a young woman here?
Nope.
- Did you?
- Nope.
I did.
- That was ed Burke's rig.
- Where did Burke go?
He picked up a couple who wanted to take a turn through the park.
- Go after him. If you find him,
I'll double that. - Yes, sir.
Let's go.
Hey! Ed! Pull up a minute.
Whoa.
Are you the driver who dropped this young lady in Tony's restaurant?
- Yep.
- She left a black leather bag in your cab.
- She sure did.
- Well, that bag belongs to me.
There's nothing to worry about, mister.
I gave it to a cop.
- You gave it to a cop?
- Yeah, a cop.
The cop at the kiosk, back at Van cortlandt drive and Fordham road.
He'll turn it in at his station.
That's what he said.
Giddap.
Fordham and Van cortlandt.
Yes, sir.
- Hello, don.
- Hello, Karen.
I saw your lights from the street.
Oh, are you going to the victory celebration?
Victory celebration?
Yes. Hudson won from parnell, and there'll be some sort of hijinks on the campus tonight.
You know, some kind of a bonfire and a snake dance.
That's not for me, Karen.
Here, sit down.
I hope you've forgiven me for carrying off your bag.
- You did no harm.
- It was stupid of me.
But I couldn't understand why you let the policeman think that my bag was yours?
You couldn't?
Well, Alan was curious, too.
You know how detectives are.
He questioned me after you left us.
Oh? Well, what about?
Why you were so excited.
You were, you know.
It was all my fault. I've been so worried.
What was in that bag, don?
Do you really want to know, Karen?
It was a head.
A human head.
You're just making fun of me.
Not at all. It was your head, Karen.
The dummy-head I made for the buzz saw trick.
Do you remember how its eyes rolled and the mouth opened in a scream when the teeth of the saw ripped into its flesh?
That was the most lifelike thing I ever made.
Do you think I'm going to let Rinaldi take that away from me, too?
Oh, no, my dear.
He'll never find that lovely head of yours.
Well. I'm glad it was nothing more serious than that.
Oh, Karen.
That celebration tonight, do they build a big bonfire?
Oh, a tremendous one.
Everybody brings fuel for it.
It's terribly exciting.
Yes, I'm sure it must be.
Well, good night, Karen.
Good night, don.
All right, boys, light it.
Toll the bell, here's parnell!
Dead as a doornail, dead as a post!
Dead on the vine, dead in the shell!
Poor parnell, well, well, well!
Toll the bell, here's parnell!
Dead as a doornail, dead as a post!
Dead on the vine, dead in the shell!
Poor parnell, well, well, well!
Toll the bell, here's parnell!
Dead as a doornail...
Mr. ormond.
I thought I recognized you.
Don't you remember me?
Oh, of course. Hello, miss Lee.
Bones found on college campus!
Get your extra here!
Oh, extraordinary, isn't it?
- About these bones they found.
- I beg your pardon?
Well, the other night, after the Hudson-parnell game, they were having a celebration on the campus.
A huge bonfire and, well, that sort of thing, you know.
Yes.
Well, what do you think they found in the ashes the next morning?
- I have no idea.
- Two human shin bones and part of a spine.
- Not really.
- Oh, yes, indeed.
I don't know what we're coming to.
- Do you have some rooms to rent?
- Hmm?
Well, I read this advertisement in the morning paper...
This is your advertisement?
Oh, yes. Yes, of course. Do come in.
Alice!
We don't make a regular thing of renting rooms, but you see, my wife's mother occupied the top floor and...
Well, she's gone on to her reward, and so we have that space on our hands.
- Yes, frank?
- Hmm?
Oh, oh, this gentleman came to see about the room you advertised.
- Mr., uh...
- Jameson. Ward Jameson.
Yes. Mrs. prentiss, my wife.
Oh, yes. Lt's a pleasure, Mr. Jameson.
I'll show you the rooms if you like.
Well, do watch the stairs.
There's no light on the upper landing.
Here we are.
This is the sitting room. The bedroom is in here, with a bath beyond.
Oh, I'm sure you'll be comfortable, and very quiet here.
That's what I'm looking for.
And my husband goes to business, and I'm always busy in my study.
I write, you know.
- You do?
- Yes. Alice prentiss.
Oh, yes. Yes, of course.
You see, I need a place where I can study and do some experimental work.
L'm afraid my habits are not those of the regular businessman.
L'm apt to return late at night, and I may not be here for days at a time.
Oh, that's quite all right.
Would you mind if I moved in right now?
I have everything I need.
But I haven't told you what I want for the rooms.
Anything you say.
Well, let me see. With maid services and everything, I had thought...
- Fifty a month?
- Fifty a month?
In advance, of course.
Oh, that's very good of you.
You've no idea what a relief it is to find just the place I need, where I can come and go as I please and be left alone.
People are always so determined to poke into your business.
I could see at once that you're not that kind.
Oh, no, no, indeed.
Uh, I'll get you a receipt.
Anytime at all.
Well, it looks like the deal is closed.
Everything is satisfactory, frank.
Oh, Mr. Jameson, have you had supper?
- No, but I...
- L'll get you some.
Oh, please don't bother.
It's no bother.
I'll have the maid bring it up.
Thank you.
Charming woman.
Oh, yes, yes. I say, did Alice tell you that she writes?
Yes, she did.
Murder mysteries. Oh, she's full of plots.
Morning, noon and night. That's all i ever hear. Plots, plots, plots.
Oh, oh, I say, here.
Here's her latest, murder is a must'.
- Rather good title, don't you think?
- Very good.
- Yes, it sold over a hundred thousand copies. - Vvhat does it mean?
Well, it's about a chap who murders a chap, and then, so not to be found out, he has to kill another one and then another one, and, well, that's the way it goes, ad infinitum, ad nauseam.
However, it's rather cute the way she dreams these things up.
I say, Alice has a theory that all murderers are crazy.
So?
Well, I don't know about that.
Well, maybe we all have a bit of it in us, and maybe if it wasn't for the law, we'd all go round killing each other.
I say, there's another good plot, don't you think?
Well, I do hope you like it here,
Mr. Jameson.
Thank you.
Hello, Claire.
The village blacksmith.
Mmm.
Not bad.
Absence makes the heart beat faster.
Are you glad to see me, darling?
Very glad.
Well, you don't show it.
At least I would expect a compliment.
You look terribly expensive.
Now you sound like my second husband.
Shall we cheat him a little bit, darling?
I don't think so.
What's the matter?
Don't you love me anymore?
I'll always love what you were.
But not what I am?
Well, I think I'm rather nice.
Lots of people do.
What are you working on?
A new trick.
Is the studio making money?
It's doing very well.
Good. Good.
I suppose you know that Ross has left me.
Can you blame him?
Yes, and so would you, if you would react normally.
Have you forgotten that I was once your wife?
L'm not likely to.
Don, he's hiding from me.
I've got to find him.
I'll get even for both of us.
Tell me where he is.
I don't know.
You don't know.
You're afraid of him.
Yes, I think you are.
You know...
You know, I often wondered why you let him make a fool of you and turned the other cheek.
Perhaps you knew all the time what was going on and didn't have the courage to do anything about it.
Don.
- What's happened to you?
- I didn't want to do that, Claire.
Now, you'd better get out of here.
But I read in the paper where Mrs.
Ross ormond had returned from Europe and found that her husband was missing.
I said to myself, “oh, you poor little creature, if only I could help you.”
Mrs. prentiss loves to help people.
And turned the other cheek.
It was rather smudgy.
No, thank you.
It was a rather smudgy happiness.
And then, Mr. ormond was wearing his whiskers in a different style, but there was something about that face that rang a bell.
She... she... she studied it under a microscope.
It was then that I determined to write to you and ask you to come here.
Oh, of course, this roomer may not be your husband, but it's well worth investigating.
What name did he use?
Ward Jameson.
What did he look like?
Oh, he's a very striking man.
The moment I laid eyes on him, i said, “there's a character.”
I collect characters.
I'm a writer, you know.
- Murder mysteries.
- Alice prentiss.
Oh. Here's a picture of my husband.
Lt's a much newer one.
Frank. Frank, what did I tell you?
I knew it in my bones.
Yes, my dear, in your bones.
This is the man, Mrs. ormond.
Is he here now?
Oh, no, no.
He spends very little time here, but he did tell the maid that he'd be in late tonight, very late.
Oh, my dear, you... you do want to make up with him, don't you?
Why, of course. Lf only he'd let me.
I don't think that will be too difficult.
Frank.
Yes, dear?
Oh, yes, my dear.
Now, my dear child,
I've handled situations like this in dozens of my books, and they always turn out in a very interesting way.
Oh?
- Frank.
- Huh? What?
Shh. He's here.
Ross.
What is the matter?
Can't you speak?
Or is the shock of seeing me too much for you?
What are you doing here?
What am I doing here?
Well, after all, I'm your wife.
Where would I be but with my husband?
How did you find me?
Well, that was easy.
You shouldn't have rented rooms from a woman who writes.
You might have guessed she'd be curious about you.
Do the prentisses know you're here?
Why, of course, my darling.
Who are you?
You're not Ross.
You're don, aren't you?
It's amazing. Incredible.
I think it would fool anybody in the world, with one exception.
The woman who lived with both of you.
Why are you masquerading like this?
Are you trying to help him against me?
Where is he?
Well, don't stand there staring at me. Answer me.
He's dead.
Yes.
You killed him.
Yes.
Aren't they going to find him?
I don't think so.
It's all right, don.
You don't have to worry about me.
I would never turn you in.
Did you think that i wanted him for myself?
I wanted his money, and now I've got it.
You've made me a very rich woman, don, and I could love you for it.
I could love you all over again.
Why, I know... I know
I've been rotten to you.
I made a terrible mistake.
I'll make up for it.
We could get married again.
We could be happy.
We can buy anything we want.
My poor, dear Claire.
Don.
Don't you know i wouldn't dare trust you?
No! No!
Mr. ormond! Mr. ormond!
Open the door!
Frank! Frank, do something!
Here. Here.
Get the police.
Yes, my dear.
Thank you.
Er... Mr. gallico...
Mrs. ormond was your former wife.
Yes, sir.
Do you believe ormond killed her?
Apparently he was with her when she died.
Mr. prentiss, you'll testify to that?
Oh, we have to, inspector.
We heard their voices.
We heard her call him by his name: Ross.
Why should he kill her? Tell me that.
I think I can show you that ormond convicted himself.
Now, he's going to show you his newfangled fingerprints.
It was adopted officially by the French, two years ago.
No two sets of prints are alike.
Come here and I'll show you what I mean.
Now, here's a print of the index finger of ormond's right hand.
Where did you get it?
From articles ormond handled while he was rooming with the prentisses.
Now, here's a second print taken from another source and blown up to the same size.
You will notice that the prints match each other, line for line.
I found this print on the surface of a gold bracelet that belonged to Mrs. ormond.
I remember the bracelet.
She was wearing it the night she was killed.
Well, we know the man we want.
The job is to find him.
That'll be all, thank you.
Oh, uh, don't leave town.
We may call you anytime.
Good day, everybody.
I suppose you found the same fingerprints in ormond's house?
Yes. In his own room.
Fresh ones, apparently.
He must have made them the night he packed a bag and moved into your house.
Are you sure it was Ross ormond you rented rooms to?
I identified his photograph.
Yes, but you could have been mistaken.
You are not infallible, madame.
Now, if you'll excuse me, i have an audience waiting for me.
I hope they hiss him off the stage.
Oh, Mr. gallico.
Your work simply fascinates me.
It's so unusual.
I wonder if I could visit your studio sometime.
Why, of course. When I have something interesting to show you,
I'll get in touch with you.
Oh, thank you so much.
Good-bye.
Alice. Alice. What are you up to?
Oh, nothing, my dear.
Nothing at all.
He's an odd character.
I may put him in a book.
Besides,
I have the strangest feeling that I've known him before.
Hello. Mr. prentiss? Oh, this is gallico.
Tomorrow morning at 11:00 I'm staging a sort of dress rehearsal in my studio of a new trick I've been building, and remembering your wife's request,
I'm inviting you both to be present.
Can you come?
Well, Mrs. prentiss isn't here at the moment, but I'm sure I can speak for her.
Almost sure.
Uh, we'd be delighted,
Mr. gallico. Delighted.
This is the first private showing of a new illusion
I've built for my own use in the theater.
Karen knows how it works, and she's going to assist me.
But for the most part, the machine you will see is automatic.
Until it is shown in the theater, i must keep it a secret so that no other magician can steal the idea.
This audience had to be one I could trust, and Karen suggested that I invite you.
Oh, Mr. gallico, we're so flattered.
Yes, this is quite an event.
Sit down, please.
Well, here we go.
Gallico the great presents his sensational new illusion, “the crematorium”.
This device feeds the body, which is to be destroyed, into the fire chamber of the crematorium.
Once inside, it releases the body, leaves it there, and then withdraws.
But unless the machine is shut off, it automatically repeats the performance within 40 seconds.
Gas is the fuel, operating under a forced draft of oxygen.
It takes a few moments for the heat to build up, but once it gets started, it develops a temperature of 3500 degrees fahrenheit.
All right, Karen. You take over.
Well, how did you like it?
Well clone, gallico. Well clone.
- How did you get in here?
- Through the door.
Then you knew that I was showing this trick.
Oh, yes. I have ways of finding out what goes on.
Can you blame me for being curious?
Take it easy, gallico.
There's no harm done.
We'll see about that.
Did you like it?
It was terribly exciting.
Oh, but isn't it dangerous?
Of course, I knew it wasn't you in there while the burning was going on, but supposing your escape device didn't work and you oouldn't get out?
What then?
The assistant controls the magician's escape.
She lets the boss out just as the flame comes on.
And what if she doesn't like the boss?
Ashes to ashes.
This thing is more than an illusion.
It really works.
Oh, it's... it's still hot.
I say, where did you get the idea for this crematorium?
From a crematory.
The heat principle is the same.
It does more than burn. It disintegrates.
Oh, thanks for inviting us.
It was a wonderful show.
But we must be running along.
Oh, by the way, have you gentlemen heard anything new about our murder case?
They're still hunting ormond.
Do you know, I'm beginning to believe that that man is dead.
No one could disappear so completely.
Want to share a cab with us, Karen?
Yes, I'm coming.
Oh, it was so sweet of you.
Yes, thanks again.
- Thank you, Karen.
- Good night.
Not bad, gallico.
Not bad at all.
Of course, it needs work, but I know you'll get the bugs out of it.
Yeah, I'll have the lithograph people send an artist over here to make me some sketches for a new poster.
“The great Rinaldi presents his shocking new illusion...
The crematorium!” save yourself the trouble.
You'll never get your hands on this one.
Do you really think so?
You know, gallico, that prentiss woman is nobody's fool.
I believe she came close to the truth about ormond.
If he were alive, he'd need money.
He wouldn't dare go to his bank, nor would he go to you, I think.
But he'd surely come to me.
I'm his partner.
Not that he'd trust me particularly, but he'd know I wouldn't turn him in.
Because, you see, he had a couple of things on me.
Ross ormond was a cold, calculating customer.
He'd ditch a woman, but he'd never kill her.
No woman could mean that much to him.
He might kick her out of his house, but he'd never move out himself.
You see, I know these things because I knew him.
I knew Claire.
I know you.
You're the kind who loves deeply, believes in the sanctity of the home, suffers in silence, broods and waits.
You had every reason to hate him.
What did you do with him, gallico?
How did you get rid of it?
Was this thing already built and hidden away?
Waiting for a job like that?
Ormond was seen alive two weeks ago.
The prentisses identified him.
- That didn't have to be him.
- Who else could it have been?
It could have been you, gallico.
From what ormond told me, you are a clever mimic, developed a wonderful new makeup, something new in the theater.
Something that might be used offstage, too.
Only a man who dreams up illusions would think of such a thing, and only people of the theater would know it was possible.
Lieutenant Bruce thinks he has ormond's fingerprints.
What if he should think to compare them with yours?
This belongs to me.
And so does everything that comes out of that brain of yours.
From now on you're a private enterprise.
Ah, I may incorporate you.
Get your souvenir programs here.
Pictures of each and every act you saw on the stage tonight.

Souvenir programs of the great Rinaldi, the one and only Rinaldi.
- Mr. Rinaldi.
- Oh, lieutenant. How do you do?
L'm fine, thank you.
It sounded like a good matinee out there.
Yes, we were sold out as usual.
I wonder if I could see you for a moment.
I have an evening performance.
I must rest.
Of course, but I actually mean a moment.
L'm not looking for an autograph.
This is police business.
Very well.
Please, uh, sit down.
You will pardon me if I change while you are here.
Of course.
Mr. Rinaldi, you've said repeatedly you don't believe Ross ormond killed his wife.
That is correct.
Do you still hold that opinion?
I am not sure that I do.
Did you have any reason to suspect that some other person might have been with Mrs. ormond when she was killed?
Why do you ask that?
Have you found new evidence?
No, but let's say I've hit upon a new theory.
But you were so positive it was ormond.
You showed us his fingerprints.
I showed you what I assumed to be his prints.
To make sure I'm on the right track,
I want a set of fingerprints from every person who was well acquainted with Mrs. ormond.
That includes you and Mr. gallico.
I have my equipment here with me.
But what right have you to ask that of me?
Am I a suspect?
Well, no, of course not.
What possible use could you make of my prints?
Don't you understand? They can prove a person innocent as well as guilty.
I do not have to prove my innocence.
Don't you want this case solved?
That is police business, not mine.
And now, if you will excuse me, lieutenant.
Just as you say, sir.
Sorry to have troubled you.
Thanks for letting me see you.
Judas priest.
Sir, I've got something to show you.
Well, all right, what is it?
What have you found?
Today at the 44th street theater,
I asked Rinaldi to let me take his fingerprints and he refused.
Rinaldi. What the devil?
Sir, please. Will you listen?
After he left the theater, i broke into his dressing room and photographed some prints from objects on his makeup table.
This is one of them.
This is ormond's.
Ormond and Rinaldi are the same man.
That's the craziest thing i ever heard.
You can see for yourself.
The prints are exactly the same.
Which proves that you can't depend on that method of identification.
But you can, sir. The fingerprints of different persons are never the same.
L'm going to bring in Rinaldi and hold him on a suspicion of murder.
On evidence like this? Do you want to make a laughingstock of the department?
The system's too new.
We don't know enough about it.
At least let me assign a couple of men to watch him. Let me make sure of him.
All right. All right.
But don't make an arrest until you get the goods on him.
And I don't mean fingerprints.
But how you can work in the same room where that poor girl was killed is beyond me.
The thoughts of a murderer and his victim are supposed to linger on the atmosphere of a room.
Why, I... I getjust the mood i want in here.
Well, you can have it.
Good luck on your murderer.
Oh, I say, there was a very nice one in the fall river thing.
The killer used an ax, and...
Oh, no, no, no, no, don't tell me now, frank. Save it.
I shall.
Frank!
- Do they know who did it?
- Know who?
Oh, oh, no. Some neighbor saw him, but he was wearing a mask.
His impersonation of the man he had killed was perfect.
The mask he wore was equally perfect.
Another face that fitted him like an outer skin.
Thin as tissue and elastic enough
to give with every move of the facial muscles.
Frank. Frank.
Frank, I've got it.
- Your... Your plot?
- No. What actually happened.
Remember I told you how much Mr.
Gallico reminded me of ormond?
Yes.
Well, there had to be a reason for that, and I think I know what it is.
They've never found a trace of ormond. I don't believe that he was ever in this house.
I believe it was gallico who rented those rooms upstairs.
Wearing greasepaint makeup?
Oh, no, frank, no. You were right about that. It had to be more than a makeup.
I think it was a mask.
Alice.
A face, I mean. The face of ormond.
That must have been his secret.
How else could he have made those quick changes in his show?
I don't believe it. It is too incredible.
But I'm convinced of it. So convinced that
I'm going to lieutenant Bruce right now.
Alice, I forbid it.
My dear, don't be ridiculous.
Karen should be here soon.
I'll be honest with you, Mrs. prentiss.
Lt's my job to follow up every lead I get, but I'm afraid your theory is going to steer us right up a blind alley.
I was worried about it myself, until you told me that the fingerprints of ormond and Rinaldi were one and the same.
Doesn't that mean they were made by one man?
Yes, it does and it could be gallico, but...
I'll find out about that before this night's over.
- Hello, Karen.
- Hello. Now, look here, Alan...
Honey, I'm sorry to have to drag you down here at this hour.
I should think you would be sorry.
What you told me on the phone about Mr. gallico is simply impossible.
Why, he's the kindest, sweetest man I've ever known.
What he told you on the phone was my theory, not his, Karen.
Well, how can you even think such a thing?
L'm sorry. I like Mr. gallico, too.
Now, listen to me, Karen.
When gallico impersonated other magicians in his show, what method did he use to make himself look like them?
Well, I don't know. He always kept it a secret from the rest of the company.
He always changed in his dressing room.
Do you think he used a mask?
No. How could he even talk or move his face with a mask on?
It would have to be a special kind of mask.
What of it? Suppose he did use one?
He never killed anybody.
He couldn't do such a thing.
Mrs. prentiss thinks that gallico might be in there right now on the stage impersonating Rinaldi.
That's utterly ridiculous.
I hope you're right.
Let's go take a look.
You know gallico better than I do.
Better than any of us.
Tell us... What do you think?
Well?
I don't understand it.
He does some things very much like Mr. gallico.
Mrs. prentiss may be right.
Now, if gallico's prints should match those of ormond and Rinaldi...
I'm going to gallico's studio.
May I go with you? Well, don't you think I've earned that reward?
Karen, do something for me.
Wait at the stage door till Rinaldi comes out.
Then talk to him.
Say anything you can think of, but keep him as long as you can.
In case he is gallico.
Come on, Mrs. prentiss.
Oh, don. don.
Why, hello, Karen.
What are you doing here?
Why, I was waiting for Mr. Rinaldi.
L'm... l'm looking for a job.
You see, I haven't done very much work lately, except a little modeling.
So I thought there might be something in this show.
Oh? Well, that's too bad.
I came here to see
Rinaldi myself, but he's gone.
Oh, I didn't see him leave.
No, they told me that he came out through the front.
- Can I drop you some place, Karen?
- Oh, no. No, thank you.
Well, I'm going straight home, and you live near my place.
It's much better than waiting here for a bus.
Come on. Get in.
Well, you're not afraid of riding with me, are you, Karen?
What's your address?
29 palisades Avenue.
How's our friend the detective?
Alan? Oh... He's all right.
He's having a little trouble finding his murderer, isn't he?
Considerable trouble.
Looks all right.
A matter of opinion.
Come in. That's the door to gallico's apartment.
See if there's a rear exit.
We may have to get out of here in a hurry.
L get you.
- Well, thanks for the lift, don.
- That's all right.
Go to bed now and get a good night's rest.
I shall. Thanks.
Good night, Karen.
Good night, don.
457 rensselaer drive.
Yes. Mm-hmm. Sure.
Well. Mm-hmm.
Good evening, miss Lee.
Hello.
I knew it.
- Thank you.
- Thank you, sir.
Hello.
This is Karen. Gallicds on the way to the studio. He'll be there any minute.
You'd better hurry and get out of there quick.
All right, Karen. L'll tell Bruce.
Well, lieutenant?
L'm sorry, Mr. gallico.
I decided to get fingerprints from all those who had known Mrs. ormond.
I asked Rinaldi for a set of his.
What did he say?
Oh, he was very angry.
I was afraid I might get the same reception from you.
You policemen don't trust anybody.
Why, lieutenant, I haven't the slightest objection to giving you my prints.
That's very nice of you.
Do you have an ink pad here?
Yes. Yes, of course.
Here you are.
And here's some paper.
Anything else you want?
We'll take your left hand first.
Just roll it on the pad, then make an imprint on the paper, so...
I'm glad to help you, lieutenant.
I... I want you to solve this case.
Next, the index finger of the left hand.
You know, I have a high regard for you, lieutenant.
I'll always have a high regard for you.
Even though we should have a slight misunderstanding.
You shouldn't have come here, lieutenant.
L'm afraid I'll have to dispose of you.
Ah, lieutenant, so you're with us again.
It's a pity I had to deal with you the way I did, but one must be firm with policemen.
Give them an inch and they'll take a mile.
Gallico, you'll get the chair for this.
They'll give me the same voltage for killing four as they would for killing three.
Ormond. His wife. The great Rinaldi.
You should have seen how neatly this machine disposed of him.
In no time at all he was a handful of ashes.
Karen. Karen. Up here.
Bruce is hurt.
I'm afraid gallico will kill him.
- I'll go and get a policeman.
- No, no, there isn't time for that.
Go to the front of the studio.
Bang on the door.
Anything to get gallico's attention.
Hurry! Hurry!
You shouldn't have come nosing around here, lieutenant.
Takes a little time for a job like this, but I set the machine at 3500 degrees fahrenheit.
When it nears that point, this door will open.
When it is fully opened, the machine will roll you in.
Actually, there will be very little pain.
Such a blast of heat brings instant oblivion.
Can you hear it sing, lieutenant?
It has the voice of a mad bull.
As you can see, my crematorium is more than an illusion.
You haven't seen it work, have you?
But you will. You'll be in it.
Gallico, you don't know what you're doing.
Yes, I know. They'll say
I'm mad, quite mad.
They'll lock me in jail for life, put me in a padded cell with a straitjacket.
No, thank you.
I'll take the chair.
Who's there? Who is it?
What do you want?
Mr. gallico, please!
Mr. gallico, please open the door!
I can't see you now.
Get away from here.
I'll get the police!
Please open the door!
You don't know what you're doing!
Help! Police!
Help! Help! Help! Help!
Bruce, are you all right?
Oh!
They are remarkable likenesses,
but l'll never believe a man could get away with such a thing.
You didn't believe the fingerprints either.
You confused me.
You told me that ormond's and Rinaldi's prints were the same.
They were. Because they were both made by gallico.
Don't take too much credit.
If it hadn't been for Mrs. prentiss, you wouldn't be alive to tell the tale, and that's exactly what I'm going to tell the newspapers, my dear lady.
Oh, no, inspector. I won't let you.
But be sure and mention my new book, murder is a must'.
So nice seeing you again.
I'd better be going.
Oh, dear me, I haven't everything that I brought in with me.
Let me see.
Oh, yes, of course. Here it is.
Come, frank.
You didn't make the world, and neither did I.
And if we had, I'm not so sure we would have made it any different.
Correction. Drop that whole speech and substitute... um... substitute...
Sorry.
What is there to be sorry about?
We didn't make the world.
And if we had, what a mess we would have made of it, being what we are.
Sorry. What is there to be sorry about? We didn't make the world.
And if we had, what a mess we would have made of it, being what we are.
Oh Bob, I've been redoing that speech at the end of act II.
Type it and send it to the theater.
That'll mean Pearce learning some new lines.
He never learned the old lines. So new one's won't make any difference.
Most of the time opening night
I thought he was in some other play, and I wished I was in some other theater.
That's no business of mine, but you've got a play that's a smash hit in New York. It looks like being one here. Why not leave it alone?
What do you suggest I do instead?
Take a walk around the National
Gallery or sit here and rot?
Or maybe go back to New York and Rot.
Get it over to the theater right away.
Good afternoon.
Is this Mr. Hannon's apartment?
That's right.
I wonder if I might see him.
Would you please tell him, Jean Lennox is here?
Is he expecting you?
No.
Excuse me, but... are you a friend of Mr. Hannon?
Well, I think of myself as one.
Won't you wait inside?
Excuse me a moment, madam.
Ask Miss Lennox to come in.
Will you come in, please, Miss Lennox.
Hello, Phil.
Hello, Jean.
What are you doing in London?
Oh, just a vacation. I wanted to drop in and say hello... and congratulate you on getting such wonderful notices.
You came 3,000 miles for that?
No, of course not.
Phil, why didn't you let me know when you were leaving New York?
You know the answer to that.
Johnny and Pat are in London.
Have you called them?
I haven't called anybody,
I've been busy working.
Phil, I don't see why you insist on acting this way.
Jean, we've been all over this a dozen times.
When a thing is finished,
I like to forget it.
Let's talk about something else, shall we?
Do you like the apartment?
It's lovely.
Come and look at this beautiful view.
Houses of Parliament over there.
There's Big Ben watching over us.
They're doing some work on him, as you can see.
Charing Cross station.
Over there we have Waterloo Bridge and St Paul's Cathedral.
We even have some prehistoric ruins that date right back to 1941.
Don't be so bitter Phil. It doesn't help.
Bitter? Me? I'm a successful playwright who's just had a hit!
A big hit.
What have I got to be bitter about
I'm alright as long as people leave me alone.
I wish people would leave things where they're supposed to be.
I have to go out now, Jean.
Were you going someplace?
No. Just back to the apartment I guess.
Oh you've taken an apartment? Well, I must come and see your view some time.
Bob, I'm going out.
Shall I come along?
No, I'm only going to the pub.
- The Eagle?
- Yes.
Are you sure you don't...
Quite sure! Quite sure.
Look, if you must do something, you can call a cab for Miss Lennox.
And when you've finished typing up that new stuff,
You can pick me up in the car at the
Eagle, and drive me to the theater.
Goodbye, Jean.
Goodbye, Phil.
Nice of you to look me up.
Do you want a cab, Miss Lennox?
Oh, no, thank you. I can manage.
- You mustn't do that, you know.
- What?
Well, fuss over him like that.
He'll go crazy if you do that.
I don't like him out alone.
I know, but he must if he thinks he can. Where is this bar?
It's two streets down, across the road.
Across the road?
Yes. You can see it from here.
Allow me.
Oh thank you.
Have you worked for him long?
Only since he came over here the last time.
Nearly two months.
Is he drinking?
Well, not exactly drinking, but not exactly not!
Have you known him a long time,
Miss Lennox?
Well, yes. I was his secretary for three years in New York and here... and here... wherever he wanted to go.
We were engaged to be married.
And then it happened.
He didn't like having me around.
So I was fired.
I'm sorry.
What's it to be this evening dear?
Scotch, please, double.
Soda or water?
Neither. Straight.
You're American, aren't you?
Yeah.
Then you'd like a bit of ice in it eh?
No thanks. I've learned to like it your way.
Here we are, then.
Thanks.
What makes you so tired, dear?
It'd be a long dreary story, one
I'm sure you've heard many times before.
But not from a young fellow like you.
Will that do?
That'll do fine. Thank you.
I don't want nothing to do with it,
Mr. Evans. I don't like the sound of it.
You'll like the money, alright.
It'll be more than this last job.
Much more.
But how do I know what you will do with it?
You needn't have to worry about that.
You just do what I tell you, and take the money and forget it.
It's dirty somehow, when people have trust in you.
Would you like me to say a little prayer?
You promised that when I went with His
Lordship that would be the last thing.
This is a much bigger come on...
Mary arrives on the tenth. You go down to meet her and take it over.
Then we take it off your hands and give you your money. What is simpler than that?
You don't understand.
I might get to like it.
No time for that.
No. No, Mr. Evans. I won't do it.
I won't!
Oh... now listen.
In less than five minutes.
So think that over!
You wouldn't do that.
You wouldn't!
No, I wouldn't do that.
Just as long as you do as you're told.
Come on, pull yourself together.
There's nothing to cry about.
All right. Is there decency left anyway. When do you want this?
Night of the ninth, same address.
I'll take you down.
Then you start the job on the tenth.
All right. Can I go now?
What's the hurry? Have another drink.
No, I have to get back.
Her Ladyship's going to a concert and there will be no one to see to them.
I'll walk out with you.
Which way do you go?
Just to the corner. 73 takes me right to the door but they always get so full.
Miss? Miss?
Would you come here, please?
Yes, dear?
Those two people who just went out.
Do you know them?
A man and a girl?
No, never saw them before.
That I can remember.
Well, what were they like?
I don't know dear.
Just a man and a girl.
Were they tall, short, young or old?
Well, he was a bit taller than she was.
Not very tall, not very old.
Sort of medium people all round.
Were they sixteen or sixty?
To tell the truth, I didn't look at them particularly.
But I think they were, you know, thirtyish.
Maybe her a bit younger.
Anything the matter, Mr. Hannon?
Oh, Bob, When you came in, did you see a man and a woman leaving?
No, There was no one coming out just now.
Miss, there must have been something about them you noticed.
Well I think she had a blue cape and he a raincoat.
Anyhow, they came right by you dear, much nearer to you than to me. You saw them, didn't you?
No, I didn't see them.
I don't see things nowadays.
I'm sorry, Sir, I didn't realise.
That's all right.
You weren't intended to.
Both of medium height.
Age - probably 25 to 35.
Woman thought to be wearing a blue cape, man a raincoat.
The woman used a perfume.
The man breathed with a slight wheezing sound as though having, having bronchial trouble.
Anyway there was something strange about his voice.
The police are coming round right away.
Okay. Now be quiet. Let me finish this.
The conversation went as follows:
"I want anything to do with it, Mr. Evans.
I don't like the sound of it."
"Oh, you'll like the money alright. And It'll be more than this last job. Much more."
"But how do I know what you're gonna do with it?"
"When do you want me?"
"The night of the ninth, same address.
Then I take you down and you start the job on the tenth."
"All right. Can I go now?"
"What's the hurry?
Have another drink."
"No. I've got to get back.
Her Ladyship is going to a concert and there'll be no one to see to them."
"I'll walk out with you.
Which way do you go?"
"Just to the corner. 73 takes me right to the door but they get so full."
"That's all there was. I couldn't hear any more. Then they came out."
Well?
You've done that verbatim, Mr. Hannon?
That's the conversation word for word?
Yes.
You must have a remarkable memory.
Well, it's my business to remember dialogue.
Well, what do you think?
Was that all there was Mr. Hannon?
Well isn't that enough for you?
There's something evil going on isn't there?
- Might be.
- What do you mean, might be?
Well you tell us what you make of it, Sir.
I figure it out like this.
This woman has something to do with children. Probably a nursemaid.
That's why she had to get back, because somebody else is going out.
So that there would be somebody there with the kids.
Um hmm, go on.
She's employed by this lordship and a ladyship.
And this Mr. Evans she's talking to is trying to force her to do something wrong.
Whatever it is, she doesn't want to do it, but she's afraid of Evans.
Scared to death of him, because of some hold he's got over her.
On the tenth, she's gonna meet this other girl, Mary... to get something from her and pass it to Evans.
It could be this other girl is a nursemaid too, and that it's a plot to kidnap a child.
Wait a minute Mr. Hannon.
I know they have kidnappings in America, but they're very rare here.
Ok, ok, then maybe it's a robbery. But it's something, something very wrong.
Mr. Hannon, you'll forgive me for saying this, but you're a dramatist and a very skillful one.
The way you've recorded that conversation is very dramatic and convincing.
I don't think Mr. Hannon's likely to give a ham performance, Inspector.
Thank you, Bob.
Look Inspector, I've only recorded it the way they said it.
Yes, but if you just take the words themselves, they could have a completely different meaning.
Such as?
Well...
Supposing this girl is employed as you say, by a titled family.
And supposing this man is just trying to entice her away to another job and with an offer of higher money.
"More money than in last job."
How about "hand over to us later"?
- Well then, hmm.
- Sorry.
It could be a temporary job.
The girl Mary is leaving and they want somebody to take over for her temporarily.
But she says "It's dirty, letting people down who are trusting her?"
Well that could be her present employer.
She might not like herself being enticed away for money?
Oh, one of those old-fashioned servants we read about.
Then why did Evans threaten her?
I didn't hear that he actually did threaten her.
But isn't it quite possible that he did during that part I didn't hear?
Quite possible.
Look, Inspector, it seems to me, you not only think I'm blind, but crazy.
I told you it's my business to know how people talk, what they're thinking when they say things.
And I tell you that girl was scared.
No one's that scared just because someone suggests changing a job.
Oh, Mr. Hannon, you may very well be right.
We're very obliged to you for getting in touch with us so promptly.
Well somebody has to act promptly, because whatever it is, it's set for the tenth. Which is just one week from today.
Well, what are you going to do?
We haven't got a lot to go on Mr. Hannon, but we shall make inquiries.
And if in the mean time you should recall anything further,
All I know is on that tape. And you're welcome to play it through at any time.
Well thank you, Mr. Hannon. We may take advantage of that.
Good evening.
Good evening.
Good evening.
Straining at the leash aren't they?
Can't wait to get started.
Where are we now?
Just passing under Waterloo Bridge.
Festival Hall, on the left.
I never saw that. After my time.
What's it like?
Modern.
What's that noise?
Helicopter coming in to
Waterloo air terminal.
They won't do anything.
Who?
Those policemen. They think I'm making something out of nothing.
Well, of course...
Sure, sure. "Nothing to go on, possibly innocent conversation and so forth."
But unless I'm going crazy, that girl was terrified.
Maybe that's it. Maybe
I am going crazy.
Well, how does it look?
Is it beautiful?
Yes, yes, very beautiful.
The view, the buildings.
You make it all so vivid
I can almost see it!
Half past 5. The sun must be just going down ahead of us.
Any barges coming down?
Yes. Two lots.
I know. And the river is gold now with the sun on it like that.
The barges black against the gold.
A slight wind that makes the water glitter, so that it slaps and dances against the side of the boat.
Wait a minute!
Wait a minute.
What's up?
That perfume. That's it, I've got it!
Jean?
Yes, Phil?
Jean there's something I want to ask you: Do you remember back home 3 years ago, we were out in a rowboat somewhere?
Yes, we were on Lake Cayuga, driving through Ithaca.
That's right. I was rowing, and it was hot, and you wiped my forehead with a handkerchief.
Yes.
There was perfume on the handkerchief, a perfume you used quite a lot then.
Do you remember what it was?
Yes. It was Plaisir d'Amour.
Do you still use it?
No. I haven't used it for almost two years. It's too expensive.
It is expensive?
About the most expensive there is.
Why?
Well that woman yesterday was using it.
I got a whiff of it as she passed me.
Will somebody please tell me what kind of nursemaid uses just about the most expensive perfume there is?
She might have been given it by the master.
I mean that sort of thing still goes on you know. Always will.
Or she may have stolen it from her mistress.
No, no. A servant could steal money or clothes or almost anything and get away with it.
But if she steals her perfume, she's giving herself away every time she comes into a room.
That's true Phil, that's very true.
The frightened nursemaid who uses expensive perfume. What does that add up to?
Maybe it's on that tape?
"I don't want anything to do with it, Mr.
Evans. I don't like the sound of it."
"Oh, you'll like the money, alright.
And it'll be more than this last job."
Miss Lennox, I put it to you.
Here's a conversation that might have meant almost anything... between two people who might have been almost anybody. Where can I go from that?
Well it's Mr. Hannon, I'm thinking of,
Inspector.
You see, this is the first real thing that's brought him to life in a long time.
The question is, how real is this?
It's very important to Mr. Hannon.
Miss Lennox, I understand your concern, and I sympathize... but what you need is a psychiatrist, not a police officer.
Well, yes, you're right,
Inspector, and I have no business taking up your time like this.
But I, well I thought if you could call him up and tell him...
Tell him what?
Well, that you were interested, and that you were working on it.
Miss Lennox, I give you my word that If anything comes of this, or even looks like coming out of it,
I'll get on to Mr. Hannon at once.
And be pleased to.
Thank you.
"And then you will take the money and forget it.
But it's dirty somehow, and people are trusting you."
"Would you like me to say a little prayer?"
"You promised when I went to his Lordship, that was the last thing."
Jean?
Yes, Phil?
Well did they see you?
Right away.
Are they getting anywhere?
Oh they're working like demons!
They've been interviewing the barmaid and checking to see if they have anyone like
Evans in they're records... and they've got a man watching The Eagle just in case those two should come back there... and they've got another man...
Bravo! An excellent performance, but you know perfectly well, they're not doing a thing.
They've just filed it under "C" for crackpot.
Bob, is 73 a bus or a tram?
A bus.
Where does it go?
Oh a long way. I can't remember where it ends, but it goes along Oxford St down Park
Lane and along Knightsbridge.
Phil? She was going back to her job, wasn't she?
That's what she said.
And her job was with somebody with a title?
A peer, because of "His Lordship".
Not a Knight or a Baronette.
And "Her Ladyship" was going to a concert.
That's right.
How many lords are there, Bob?
- Including or excluding the Irish period?
- I don't care.
I don't know.
Well how ever many there are, there can't be so many that live in London, on one particular bus route and have children of nursery age.
And wives who went to a concert last night.
Bob, there's a book for lords, isn't there?
There's Burke's Peerage,
Baronetage and Knightage of the United Kingdom.
We've got one here.
Oh, here's one -
Baron Yalding of Hayle, H-A-Y-L-E.
Two sons, one daughter.
Heir, born 1949.
Address -
46 Link Court, Knightsbridge.
Telephone, Avenue 7473.
Well, I think that's all the possibles.
Well there's a Baron Zwemmer in Park Lane but I don't think he's got any young children of nursery age.
Well how old is he?
78, and never been married. Still...
Well, I think we can safely leave him out.
How many?
Twenty.
Ok.
Well now what we want is one whose wife went to a concert. Let's start calling them up.
We can't now.
It's two o'clock in the morning.
And I don't know about you two, but I'm exhausted.
I'm sorry. You must be.
I wasn't thinking.
Bob, call Miss Lennox a taxi, would you?
Certainly.
Phil, is it alright if
I come back tomorrow?
I really am interested.
Sure. Bob and I will start on these phone calls first thing in the morning.
I'll see you then.
Good.
Well, good night.
Good night, Jean.
Thanks for your help.
That's alright.
No, I'm afraid Your Ladyship is misunderstanding me.
I am not giving a concert.
I mean, I couldn't.
It's just that I understood that you went to a concert on Tuesday.
Oh, I see.
I must have been misinformed.
I'm sorry I bothered you,
Your Ladyship.
No go. She says she never goes to concerts.
She doesn't sound sound the slightest bit musical.
Sobey.
Hello? Can I speak to Lady Sobey, please?
I'm speaking for...
Oh, oh really?
I didn't know Th... yes, I see.
I'm sorry to have troubled you.
Deceased.
Before or after the concert?
Two months ago.
Alright, how many's that?
Seventeen. Next, Lady Syrett.
You stay with the phone,
I'll get the door.
Mayfair... one... two... oh... oh...
- We're making the calls now.
- Oh, good.
Hello? Could I speak to
Lady Syrett, please.
I'm speaking for Mr. Phillip Hannon.
Yes.
Hello? Lady Syrett?
Good afternoon, Your Ladyship.
I tried to get you on Tuesday evening but I believe you were at a concert.
You were? I see!
I'm speaking for Mr. Phillip Hannon, the playwright.
Yes, that's the one. Mr.
Hannon wonders whether if he could come over and see you sometime.
There's a small matter on which he wanted your help.
- Some more tea?
- No, thank you.
Another cake?
No thank you.
I can't tell you how exciting it is for me, having a famous playwright here for tea with me.
Especially as I've been trying desperately to get tickets for your play, but
I've had no luck at all.
Well if you'll allow me Lady
Syrett, I'll be happy to leave my tickets for you at the box office any night you say.
Oh that is kind of you Mr.
Hannon, and I do appreciate it.
Lady Syrett, you must think this very odd, our asking to come to see you like this.
Oh, don't give it a thought. If one couldn't look forward to odd things happening... no one would want to get up in the mornings at all, would they?
No, I suppose not. But...
But you see this is kind of...
Oh, just one thing. Could you possibly make it 4 tickets for this Saturday?
Oh yes, of course. Make a note of that, Bob.
We're dining with some old friends of my husbands, the Belmont's that are a frightfully dreary couple.
They're Bird-watchers, you know.
Of course I don't mind them watching, but they talk about it endlessly.
And it just occurred to me that it would be a marvelous way to get through the evening.
Oh, now, where were we?
I was about to ask you a question.
Oh yes, please. Please do.
Well, it's a very small matter, but some friends of mine heard that your children's nurse... oh, I've forgotten her name...
Janet Murch.
That's it, Janet Murch, that she might be leaving.
My friends understood she's a very good nurse.
Oh she is perfectly marvelous.
That's why I'm so annoyed with her.
Pardon me, Lady Syrett? I got lost in there somewhere.
Oh it's quite simple really.
You see these are not my children, they're my Grandchildren.
So Miss Murch walking out on me like this just has me at my wits' end.
Did Janet Murch give you any reason for leaving?
Yes, indeed. She just took another position if you please.
She said she was starting on the tenth.
I called the agency that sent her to me and complained bitterly, but
I got no satisfaction.
Which agency?
The Unity Domestic Bureau.
Well, thank you Lady Syrett, we've taken up enough of your time.
Oh not at all. I've enjoyed it.
Would you mind if I asked you a funny sort of question?
Of course not!
Do you ever use a perfume called Plaisir d'Amour?
No, Mr. Hannon. Ought I to?
No, not while you're using that charming Bal des Fleurs you have on now.
Thank you again, Lady Syrett.
Not at all.
- Good bye
- Good bye.
Did you get that address, Bob?
The Unity Domestic Bureau.
Janet Murch...
I did.
Janet Murch?
Yes.
Janet Murch. I seem to recall the name.
I'm sure we must have placed her sometime.
Now, let me see.
Ah, here we are. She's with Lady Syrett, in Brook St.
Well no, she's just left there. That's why
I thought I might be able to get her.
Left there, well, well,
She's only been there a few months too.
I'm terribly anxious to get Miss Murch.
I wonder if I might have her home address?
Let me see, Janet
Murch's home address.
I'm very sorry, madam. As I said, I'm very sorry, but we can't do that.
After all it wouldn't be very good business now would it now?
I mean you could get in touch with the girl yourself and then we'd lose our commission.
I'll look after this lady Miss Maston.
Would you come in?
I'm dreadfully sorry, Mr. Pillings.
I didn't think.
No, of course you didn't.
Have this chair.
Thank you.
Well know, I understand you're looking for a nursemaid?
Well, yes...
We've got some very good girls in our books.
Well, as I told your assistant, I particularly wanted Janet Murch.
Because she's been so highly recommended by Lady Syrett.
Oh, we've got several others just as good, if not better. Let me just have a look, hmm?
Ah yes, now here's a very excellent Scotch lass named MacDonald. Very good recommendations, too.
Well, thank you very much. I'll think it over and let you know.
I see, in that case Madam, perhaps
I'd just better have your address.
You never know, Janet
Murch might come in, or perhaps if not, we can find you somebody else.
It's a Mrs.?
Mrs. Jean Lennox.
Jean Lennox...
603 Regent Court, Portman Sq, W1.
Portman Square, W1. Telephone?
Arcade 6549.
Arcade 6549.
Mrs. Jean Lennox.
Thank you very much.
Good day, madam. Thank you.
I'm sorry, Mr. Pillings. I didn't know, really. No one told me.
Well, go on, go on.
Well, he was very tall, almost 6 feet, so I don't think he could be Evans.
What sort of voice did he have?
Smooth and oily. He was very positive.
Did he wheeze when he breathed?
Well if he did, I didn't hear it.
I'm afraid that's a blind alley, Phil.
I mean the agency did look genuine.
And after all even if
Janet Murch is your girl, there's no reason the agency should be in on it.
No. Maybe not.
I'm sorry, Madam.
603, please.
603. Sixth floor. That's Mr. Hannon.
Hannon?
The name I have got here is Lennox.
Well, 603 is Mr. Hannon, ma'am.
603, Right there, ma'am.
Thank you.
Excuse me. Does Mrs. Lennox live here?
I'm from the Unity Domestic Bureau, it's about the situation.
I see.
Can I have your name, please?
Alice MacDonald.
Alright, I'll just see if Miss... Mrs.
Lennox is in. Won't you come in please.
Excuse me one moment.
Alice MacDonald. That's the girl they tried to sell me.
How did she find you here?
Well, I gave this address because
I thought if they got a hold of Murch...
Ok, ok.
Bob, you take her into the living room.
Jean, you keep her talking because I want to listen.
Tell her that you are making these arrangements for me.
That my family is coming over from America. Get it?
Yes.
Ok.
I'll wait in here. I don't want her to know I can't see.
Oh, good afternoon.
Good afternoon, Madam.
Won't you sit down?
Well, thank you.
I hope I've come to the right place.
Only the Bureau said Mrs. Lennox.
But the lift man said Mr. Hannon.
Well, yes. I'm Mrs. Lennox, and I was inquiring not for myself, but for Mr.
Hannon, who lives here.
Oh, I see.
You see, Mr. Hannon's family may be coming over from
America soon. And if they do, they'll need a nurse.
Yes, Madam.
Only the Bureau said there was someone else you particularly wanted, but if you couldn't get her perhaps I would do.
Someone called Janet Murch was recommended to me. You don't happen to know her?
Murch? No, Sir, I don't.
Only the Bureau said to show you my references.
Thank you. I'll take them.
Oh my, these are very good.
Here, Phil, have look at them.
They're really very impressive aren't they?
Yes, very.
Well thank you very much, but as I said, Mr.
Hannon's plans aren't quite definite yet.
If he does need a nurse, we'll call you.
If you'd like to leave your address...
Oh, you can always reach me through the Bureau.
- Good afternoon, Madam.
- Good afternoon.
Good afternoon.
Bob, go after that girl.
Don't lose sight of her.
Find out where she lives, and if you can, get a picture of her.
Picture, what on earth for?
She might be Murch, the barmaid seen her,
Lady Syrett has seen her. Now hurry up, you'll lose her.
How will I get a photograph?
With a camera, you idiot. Hurry!
Camera, of course.
Well, did you smell it?
No. What?
Did you hear it?
Well, what?
Oh, you people with eyes. You're so busy looking you never notice anything.
She smelled of that perfume.
And that Scotch accent of hers, that was pure vaudeville.
Then you really think she was Murch?
She could be. It isn't the right sort of voice, but people can do things with their voices.
Follow that bus.
Hey! What about the money?
No! Go on.
Keep the change.
May I interest you in a new cleaner, madam?
It's absolutely marvelous. It cleans all the spots right away. May I show you? Look.
It's absolutely wonderful.
Oh, here!
- Thank you.
Yes, very well Sir.
- Now where do I go with this?
- Over there Sir, just by the haberdashery.
Good day, Sir.
£3.10s - is that right?
Three pounds ten shillings, Sir.
Here, and ready for use?
Ready for immediate use, Sir.
Shall I wrap it up for you Sir?
No, no I'll take it just as it is.
Very good, Sir.
Please! I'm in a hurry.
Here we are!
Ham and eggs, country style.
Toast and butter is on the left, coffee on the right.
And a very pretty girl directly opposite me.
Well, thank you, Sir.
It's just like old times, isn't it, Phil?
It's certainly like old something!
Alright you marry me and I promise you faithfully I'll give up cooking.
That's the most refreshing proposal I've ever had.
I'll have you know I don't go around just proposing to anybody.
I've only proposed twice in my life, both times to the same man.
I know, Jean. I wish I could see it your way, but I can't.
Well eat your dinner. It'll get cold.
Hello, Bob.
Hello.
Well did you get anything?
Yes. Pneumonia!
You're wet. I can smell that tweed suit over here.
Yes, It's the rain you know. It makes you wet if you stand out in it for hours on end.
Without a coat.
Well, where did she go?
First of all she went into
Barker's in Kensington.
Where she bought something.
Well, What?
Well, I don't know. I was busy buying the camera.
Her parcel was a long one, about two feet long. She came out of Barker's... rain started.
Took a bus to Hammersmith.
Still raining.
Looked in a chemist's window, went into chemist's, came out again. Raining.
Went into a cafe, had a cup of tea and one bun.
Or it could have been one tart. The view was obscured with the rain on the window.
Went into chain store, walked around store.
Walked around store again, came out...
Excuse me, it's a bit smudged here.
Oh, yes, I see - raining heavily.
Do you want me to go on?
There's a lot more like that.
Just like that.
But did you find out where she lives?
I don't believe that she has a home.
If she has, she despises it.
She wouldn't be caught dead in it.
She fast prefers to wander around the streets.
But you must have left her some place.
Excuse me Mr. Hannon, there is no "must" about it.
As a matter of fact, she left me.
Oh no.
I followed her to a building.
224 Stoner Street. She went inside.
I waited outside.
I waited and waited and waited.
After three hours, I began to think things looked a little bit fishy, so I went inside.
It was an empty sort of warehouse.
No sign of MacDonald.
But do you think she ducked you deliberately?
Oh, I don't know. There were at least four perfectly reasonable exits back and side that she could have used.
Well, that certainly was a dead end street.
Well, never mind, Bob.
I think you did very well.
Here. Have a cup of hot coffee.
Oh, thank you.
Anyhow, I got her photograph.
You did?
Uh-hmm. Except that I'm not quite sure that I turned the film on properly.
No Mr. Hannon, no.
This isn't Janet Murch.
But is it anything like her?
Not at all. This girl is a bit older and quite different.
Have you ever seen this girl in the photograph?
No, never that I can think of.
You're sure it's not just a bad photograph?
It's a very good photograph taken in conditions of extreme difficulty.
I have a feeling there is something perfectly fascinating going on.
I do wish you'd tell me what it is.
I wish I could too.
But frankly, Lady Syrett, I can't explain it even to myself.
Just now.
Oh.
Well, if you ever feel you can, please call me.
It'll make my dinner table conversation for six months. I never have anything to say.
Well, thank you again, Lady Syrett.
Thank you.
She's got no right not to be Murch.
She even smelled right.
And you can't tell me it's just coincidence,
Two nursemaids using the same expensive perfume.
Frankly, Mr. Hannon,
I didn't smell it.
You?
I could cook fish and chips under your nose and you'd never smell it!
When I first met McDonald,
I didn't have a cold.
She was the cause of my catching it.
Smells are very tricky, Phil.
If you have a certain scent in mind, you can always make yourself believe you can smell it.
That's perfectly true. I can always smell escaping gas whenever I... give my mind to it.
What are you two trying to tell me?
That I've invented this out of hole cloth?
Well, of course not.
Because if that's what you think, will you both please stop humoring me!
Stop treating me as if I was some child, whom you had to keep amused with a game of "Let's Play Detective."
Drive Miss Lennox home, would you please, Bob?
Never mind, Bob. You go on up with him. I'll get a taxi.
"You go down and meet her and take over."
"Then we take it off your hands and give you your money."
And you go on a.
Who's that?
Why didn't you take Jean home?
She took a taxi.
She thought you shouldn't be alone.
Now I need a nursemaid.
"... nice long holiday,"
"What is simpler than that?"
"But you don't understand.
I might get to like it."
"You won't have time for that, my dear."
"No, Mr. Evans, no. I won't do it.
I won't."
It's no good, Mr. Evans.
I'm after you.
Sure I know it's unreasonable.
But I'm not a reasonable man.
If MacDonald isn't Murch, and you're not the guy at the agency...
Who is Murch?
Lady Syrett?
And who are you Mr. Evans?
And who are you, Mr. Evans?
Dicky Dight, show a light
Or else the dogs can't follow!
Or else the dogs can't follow.
Follow!
- Did you call, Mr. Hannon?
- No, no I sang.
Bob, I want to put an advertisement in the newspapers.
- Which ones?
- All of them.
"If Janet Murch is in need of help or advice will she call Arcade 6549."
- That's our number.
- I know.
"Strictest confidence."
Oh Bob, how on earth could you let him do this?
I told you this morning,
I didn't think.
Think, what?
I've just read this ridiculous advertisement of yours.
When did you start reading classified ads?
Well, I talked to Bob this morning, and he told me what you'd done.
Do you realise what you are setting yourself up for?
Of course. I'm trying to find Janet Murch.
And Evans, particularly Evans.
But don't you realize that you're telling whoever they are that you know something?
And you're telling them where to find you.
Phil, this is the last thing in the world
I want to say to you, but you've got to face it.
You can't afford to get mixed up in any violence.
Hello?
Arcade 6549.
Mr. Hannon's apartment.
Oh.
Yes.
It's a woman. She says she's Janet Murch.
Give me that phone.
You get on the extension, and take a tape of us.
It's Ok.
- This is Phillip Hannon speaking.
- "Hello, what's the good news?"
Is this Miss Janet Murch?
"That's right, Janet Murch. You want to contact me, and I want to contact you, honey."
"Do I need help and advice?
I certainly do!"
Where are you speaking from?
From the bar docks. Best bar in London.
Why don't you come down and have one?
Well whoever that was, it wasn't Janet Murch.
Just a drunk who read the advertisement and rang up for fun.
Well I rung. It's a bloke called Phillip
Hannon, if that means anything to you/
Hmm?
Now look. You don't have to be concerned about me.
There are day and night porters, downstairs, there are two locks and a chain on the door, and I've got Bob.
I'm defended like Fort Knox.
What about you?
Me?
Well, you're in this you know.
You went to the agency, and if the agency is in it, they'll be looking for you too.
And you live by yourself.
Oh, nonsense, Phil.
What do you mean nonsense?
Don't you live by yourself?
Yes, but...
I don't want you alone in that apartment for the next few days.
Bob, get Miss Lennox some rooms in a hotel.
Now look, if you think I'm gonna move out of a perfectly good apartment,
- for some lousy hotel.
- Take her along, Bob.
A reasonably nice hotel, maybe even a private bath.
You always were the most impossible man.
- Goodbye, Jean.
- Goodbye, Phil.
Who is it?
It's me, deary. Elsie Schuyler.
Oh, just a moment.
Oh, Janet luv, I have to go out. Would you be a dear and take care for Pokey for me?
I'd take her with me but it's a seance and
Madame Pavio's medium doesn't get on with Pokey at all.
Well I was just going out.
Oh, dear.
But only to make a phone call.
I'll be back in a few minutes.
Oh, Janet, you are a duck.
I'll wait for you.
"Hello, hello?"
Arcade 6549...
- You said to contact you.
- Yes.
This is Janet Murch, isn't it?
Yes.
I recognise your voice.
Well, never mind about that now.
This is Phillip Hannon speaking. I inserted the advertisement.
It said to contact you.
That's right. I want to talk to you.
Can you come here?
"No. I can't leave home."
Where are you speaking from?
"From my home. I can't leave here, but if you could meet my father, he'd bring you."
Can he come over here?
813 Regent Court, Portman Square.
"No, but anywhere else you say."
But why not here?
"Someone might see."
Alright. Do you know a pub called The Eagle, near here?
Yes.
I'll meet your father there, now.
It'll only take me a few minutes.
"No, no, not now.
In an hour would be better."
Alright, I'll be there. Goodbye.
No, I'm sorry, Sir. He doesn't seem to answer. Can I take a message for you?
Oh, Alright, Sir.
Simmons, would you mind taking a message for Mr. Mathews?
Not at all Mr. Hannon.
Tell him I've had a telephone call, and that I've gone to The Eagle.
Ask him to follow at once.
Alright Sir.
- Oh, I'm so sorry!
- I beg your pardon!
Where is this, Governor?
Why you're on the north side of Portman Square.
Well where's Baker Street?
It's just 23 paces behind you.
Here, take my arm, I'll show you.
Thanks.
It sort of mists up my spectacles and I can't see anymore than if I'd got my head in a bucket.
It must be a great handicap, having to wear glasses!
Well, here's a brave man.
Oh, it's you, dear!
Good evening.
Straight Scotch, no ice, isn't it?
Yes.
Do you know, I think you're wonderful the way you get about.
If you hadn't told me, I should have ever know that you...
I suppose you sort of get used to it?
Don't ever believe that.
You get so there are some things that you can do, but you never get used to it.
Is there anybody here?
Not a soul, dear. No one's coming out on a night like this,
Even to get to the water hole.
- I wonder if you'd help me?
- Of course!
I'm expecting to meet somebody here - should be a middle-aged man.
Take a good look at him and see if he's the same one I asked you about the other day.
And get him talking, I want to hear his voice.
If he is the same one, cough.
But I told you I didn't get a good look at him.
Well if he's anything like the one you remember, cough.
Alright.
If you cough, I'll go, and you say "Good night, Mr. Doyle."
Otherwise, come over and give me a drink.
If I think it's the same man I cough, and say "Good night, Mr. Doyle." Okay, dear.
Now, tell me exactly where the pinball machine is.
Yes, over there, on the right.
No, a little this way.
That's it.
You've been very kind.
You see, I particularly don't want him to know about my eyes.
Don't you now?
No.
All right, ducks, whatever you say.
Thanks.
- Good evening.
- Evening.
Half o' mild, please.
Yes, Sir.
Here you are, Sir.
Thank you, ma'am.
- What a night, eh?
- Ah, it is that. You can't see a hand before yer face.
You remember the bad fog we had in the war?
I reckon this is thicker.
Oh, thank you.
I don't think he's the same one. He looks quite a respectable little cuft.
Stand in front of him and talk, so I'll know where he is.
He's on the third stool from the door.
Well, I certainly didn't expect to see any customers out tonight, and here I am with two.
Well sometimes people have to go out even in a fog.
Good evening. Nasty night, isn't it?
It is that, Sir.
It makes everybody late for things.
- Your not by any chance, Mr. Hannon?
- Yes, I am.
I'm Mr. Murch. Let's sit down to a table.
Well... er...
I'll take your drink over for you, ducks.
Here's a nice table.
How's that?
Okay, dear?
Thanks.
Good evening, Sir.
Oh, Mr. Mathews, I've got a...
And not a word can I get out of her, except that she wants to see you.
But there's something not right, Sir, not right at all, and not been for a long time.
Has she ever mentioned a man named Evans to you?
Evans? No, no never mentioned that name nor any other.
I tell you, she's been that close.
Well...
Cheers!
Cheers.
How long ago did Mr. Hannon leave?
About 20 minutes ago, Mr. Matthews.
It's only a little bit of a distance.
Do you mind if I take your arm?
I'm not used to these fogs.
Why of course, Sir. Though it seems to have thinned out considerably.
Yes, it has.
Sharp round here to the left.
He went out of that door, yes, and he turned right round to the left and he was with another man.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
This is it. Here we are, now.
Watch your step. Take care, Sir.
Just a minute, Sir, now while
I switch on the light.
Ah, that's better. Now we can see what we're doing.
Now will you come upstairs?
I'm afraid it's rather a climb. We're right up at the top. Careful, now.
Careful. Take a foot.
There we are.
It's a long climb, isn't it? It's not much of a place, Sir, as you see.
Here we are now.
Now, I'll take you in and then I'll leave you together because she won't talk if I'm there.
Come in, Sir.
Mr. Murch?
Mr. Murch?
Anybody here?
Mr. Hannon?
Mr. Hannon? Where are you?
Bob! Up here, up high.
Mr. Hannon! Stay where you are! Don't move!
Don't move till I get to you.
What's the matter?
Man up there. Come on. Follow me!
- Mr. Hannon! Mr. Hannon!
- Bob, I'm in here!
Are you alright?
I'm alright, just get me out of here.
You're alright now.
Where am I? What is this?
It's a bombed building.
The whole front is missing.
One more step and I would have been missing too.
- Hello, Joe. Filthy night, isn't it?
- It is that, Mr. Pillings.
Well, did you see Mr. Hannon?
Yes, Mr. Pillings. And it's all done.
That's good news, Joe.
Very good news indeed.
It will save everybody a lot of trouble.
Hello? Yes.
Joe's just come in...
He says Mr. Hannon won't be needing a nursemaid any more.
Yes, I will.
Bye.
He says to tell you, "Very well done, Joe."
Thank you, Mr. Pillings.
Would you like some tea, Joe?
No thank you, Mr. Pillings.
Not now, I find if I drink tea at night it keeps me awake.
Thanks, Jean.
Phil?
I want you to promise me that you'll never do that again.
Well it isn't the sort of thing folks do do again, is it?
You know, Jean, the strangest thing happened to me out there on that ledge.
I thought I didn't care about living any more, but I was wrong.
I found that out when I came right to it.
I cared desperately.
Do you know what I'm trying to say,
Jean?
Yes, Phil.
Only don't get yourself killed proving you want to live.
Excuse me, Mr. Hannon, Inspector Grovening and detective Sargent Luce are here.
Oh, are they? Well show them in.
Won't you come in please, Inspector.
Morning, Mr. Hannon.
Hello, Inspector.
I'm told you've been having some adventures, Mr. Hannon.
Adventures? No. If you have a dramatic mind, you might think someone had tried to break my neck.
But I'll bet there's a perfectly innocent explanation for that.
Mr. Hannon, according to the barmaid at
The Eagle, you were expecting this man.
Why were you meeting him?
Did you know who he was?
No. But I knew who he wasn't.
He wasn't Evans.
Outside of that, I only knew what he called himself.
The father of a girl named Janet Murch.
I see...
You've been making inquiries for her, haven't you? Advertising and so on?
That's right inspector.
What was your interest in
Janet Murch, Mr. Hannon?
She was the girl I heard in the bar.
And you contacted her?
Yes. I spoke to her on the telephone last night.
Inspector, you have to find Murch, and you have to find her fast.
Mr. Hannon,
Janet Murch may have been associated with criminals as you thought, though that's by no means certain.
But there's one thing that is certain:
Whatever anybody was asking her to do, tonight or tomorrow,
Her body was taken out of the river early this morning.
- She was murdered?
- Yes. A nasty job with a knife.
And what's more, I'm responsible.
You, responsible?
Yes, with that advertisement.
She saw the advertisement but so did Evans.
And Evans knew I was on to something through her.
So he murdered her.
And then tried to have me murdered too.
I killed that poor kid as surely as if I'd shot her.
Inspector, we have to get Evans.
And we have to get him before tomorrow.
Mr. Hannon, as I told you before...
But it's starting Inspector!
It's the ninth today, it's happening somewhere out there, now!
You must remember, Mr. Hannon, there are nine million people out there.
Nine million.
And none of us have ever seen Evans, and only you have even heard him.
This morning he seem to prefer whiskey to scrambled eggs.
Well, if it helps him get through today,
I'm all for it.
So am I, but it seems to have no more effect on him than milk on a baby.
I'll go see what I can do.
Does he know I stayed here last night?
He knows that today is the tenth.
That's all he knows.
"This is all you've got to do."
"Mary arrives on the tenth."
Jean?
Yes, Phil.
Well, you didn't just come in?
No, I stayed here last night.
Stayed here?
Yes, in your spare room.
Well, I hope you were comfortable.
Can I fix you one?
Phil, at ten o'clock in the morning?
At ten o'clock in the morning, and at half past ten, on the tenth hour of the tenth day.
Let's drink to that.
You don't mind that I stayed here?
Bob has to go out occasionally,
And you felt there was a job for an assistant keeper.
Well, the facts support that.
It seems I can't get off the string, without nearly getting myself killed... and other people, quite killed.
But you didn't know.
I didn't know Evans was that desperate.
Well how could you?
"You go down to meet her and take over.
Then we take it off your hands, and give you your money".
"And you go on a nice..."
Why do you keep playing that thing over and over again?
You must know it by heart.
I knew it by heart to start with.
But you can know your words without knowing what they mean.
Somewhere that thing is trying to tell me about Evans.
Who he is, and what it is he's gonna do today.
But I can't seem to hear it and the rest of you can only see.
"You wouldn't."
"No, my dear, I wouldn't do that. Not just as long as you do as you're told."
"Now come on, pull yourself together:
There's nothing to cry about."
Alright, Mr. Evans, you win.
Jean, are you over by the window?
Yes.
Is it still foggy?
A little. It's almost clear now.
What do you see?
You know, Phil. You told me the first time I came here.
That's right.
Houses of Parliament, Big
Ben, Charing Cross Station...
Station...
I wonder if Mary would be arriving at a station?
What train would she be on?
A suburban train? A boat train?
What's that? A boat on the river?
Yes.
Why is he sounding it if it isn't foggy?
They often do.
That's right. Leaving or arriving, and so forth.
I remember the time I was coming over on the Queen Mary...
Mary.
"Mary on the 10th!"
Bob!
Bob!
Bob!
Phil!
Sir?
Find out when the Queen Mary arrives.
Queen Mary?
Yes, and hurry!
- Why?
- Don't you get it?
It was then, when that pinball machine made all the racket.
I missed a bit there.
I heard it as "Mary arrives."
But it could have been
"The Queen Mary arrives".
And "You go down to meet her" could have been, down to meet her at Southampton.
And she's not a girl, but a ship.
They were taking Janet Murch down to meet somebody off that boat.
Hello? I want some information please.
Can you tell me what time the Queen
Mary docked at Southhampton?
Well, have you got em?
Thank you, thank you.
Hold on a moment please.
The Queen Mary docked at
6 'o'clock this morning.
The boat train should have arrived in London, just after ten.
What time is it now?
It's 10.30.
Alright, look.
Get her passenger list.
Find out what rich, first-class passengers are traveling with children.
And get after that fireball policeman.
Yes.
Well, thank you very much indeed.
I'm sorry to have bothered you.
Goodbye.
Well, that crosses them off.
Now that's Mr. and Mrs. Richard
Avery, from Houston, Texas.
With two children, they brought their own nurse with them.
Isn't there one more?
Yes, the Argentinians, the Da Mestres.
Ah yes, the Da Mestres. We haven't been able get a hold of them yet.
They've taken a flat in Kensington.
Anyhow, the daughter there is 17. They'd hardly need a nurse for her, would they?
Still, we'll go on try and find them, Mr.
Hannon. To be on the safe side.
I hope you're wrong, Mr. Hannon.
Inspector, I don't want to be right.
I'm just scared sick that I might be.
I don't know if it's nerves or the cold, but I'm freezing to death.
I'm sorry. There's a blanket back here somewhere.
Here we are.
- There, that better?
- Thank you.
They seem to be taking forever up there.
It's only been ten minutes. They know what they are doing.
They're just active.
They don't know what they're doing.
A 17-year-old girl wouldn't need a nursemaid.
I'm completely lost.
I can't figure it.
What's that! What happened?
I think it's Mrs. Da Mestre.
I want you to cover all the gates in the gardens.
We're looking for a 17-year-old girl in a wheelchair.
With a nursemaid, wearing white uniform, black shoes, dark blue cape and cap.
- Hurry.
- Right, Sir.
She's an invalid?
Well, her father told me, that she's a child who never grew up.
They keep her with them, always.
Those poor people.
- Jean?
- Yes?
Any luck?
No.
Phil, don't you think we go ought to go home? It's getting awfully cold.
No. I'm not an awful lot of use, but
I want to stick around, just in case.
- I think they've found something.
- Take me over!
There's a fence here.
Get some lights up to cover this area.
Won't be a minute, Sir.
Hello Mr. Hannon.
Good evening, Inspector.
What did they find?
It's an invalid chair, the upright kind.
I think it'll come down so that you can lie flat in it.
Anything in it?
Yes, a robe, and a pillow, and what do you call it? A golliwog.
A what?
Golliwog. I don't think we have them in America.
There kind of a soft doll with a black face.
A soft doll?
Yes. It's a rather large one.
Looks new.
Inspector?
What is it Mr. Hannon?
The doll, could I please have it for a minute?
What for?
I just want to hold it.
There won't be any fingerprints on it.
Alright.
Oh, thank you.
Here you are.
She went into the department store, in the toy department... and bought something. A package about two feet long.
Inspector!
Yes, Mr. Hannon?
If you want to find the person that handled this last... and handled it quite a lot.
I suggest you come with me to 224 Stoner Street.
You mean MacDonald?
I don't know who I mean by now, but you followed that perfume to Stoner street.
But it's an empty house.
Of course it is. If you kidnapped a child, where would you take it? To Claridges?
Well, how about it Inspector?
Are you willing to take another chance on one of my long shots?
If so, we'd better hurry.
Mr. Mathews, you know where this place is, you better come with us.
Miss Lennox, will you drive Mr.
Hannon home?
Yes, of course, Inspector.
But Evans may be at that place.
You won't know him.
Mr. Hannon, if you're right about this, you've seen more with no eyes than most of us with two.
But things where things might get rough, and if they did, it's no place for you.
I'm sorry. Come on.
Well, I can't stand here all night.
Where's the car?
Straight ahead.
Hello?
We got them, Mr. Hannon.
The child's there?
Yes.
She's a bit sleepy they've given her something, but she's quite alright.
Look, the inspector wants to speak to you, hold on.
Well, Mr. Hannon, I congratulate you.
You were quite right.
Have you got Evans?
Well, there are two men, but we don't know which one is Evans yet.
But one of them is an old friend of ours called, Teapot Charlie.
He's had a good many different names at one time or another, and I dare say "Evans" is one of them.
The other one answers pretty closely to the barmaid's description of your "Mr. Murch".
Yeah, but how bout MacDonald?
"Well there is a woman, but she's not the one Mathews followed."
Not MacDonald? Well, that's funny.
Oh, we've got the nets out for her, shouldn't take long to pick her up.
I see. Any trouble?
"No, no they came like lambs."
Oh, then I wouldn't have been so much in the way after all would I, Inspector?
Hello? Hello!
Inspector? Hello?
Hello? He's hung up. I'm afraid he's still pretty sore!
Oh, there you are.
I thought I'd lost you.
Well congratulations... Not at all.
You're welcome.
Well, that appears to be that.
Did they get them?
Oh yes, yes. Inspector Grovening and the British police arrived in the nick of time.
Will wonders never cease?
Well, while you're sitting here in the dark moping, I'm gonna fix myself a drink.
Help yourself, if you have anything to drink too.
But personally, I think
I'm gonna go to bed.
Don't worry, I'll get out. Just as soon as
I finish this drink I'll be gone.
Here's to Phillip Hannon. It's no good congratulating him on a good job.
All you get's a grunt.
It's no good wishing him happiness, because he doesn't want it, and won't have it.
He'd rather be lonely and tragic.
It's no good wishing him luck. Because for him, all luck must be bad luck.
So here's to Mr. Hannon, the man for whom something must always go wrong... or not be complete enough, so that he can sit and mope about it!
To Mr. Hannon, who's so proud he won't let anybody help him... who doesn't want any help even if it's only to cross the street.
Shall I call you a taxi? Or is there anything else you want to say?
Well?
Well, as soon as Bob comes, I'll go.
Bob's on his way home now.
There's nothing to stay for.
No, I guess there isn't.
Goodbye, Phil.
Goodbye, Jean.
Jean?
Jean?
Bob?
Come in, Mr. Evans. We're equal now.
Not afraid of the dark, are you?
Come in, Mr. Evans.
Come in, Mr. Evans. We're equal now.
Not afraid of the dark, are you?
Come in, Mr. Evans.
Come in, Mr. Evans. Today is the tenth. I've been expecting you.
Not afraid of the dark, are you?
"Come in, Mr. Evans. We're equal now."
"Not afraid of the dark, are you?"
"Come in, Mr. Evans."
"Come in, Mr. Evans. We're equal now.
Not afraid of the dark, are you?"
"Come in, Mr. Evans."
"Come in Mr. Evans. Today..."
"I've been expecting you."
"Not afraid of the dark, are you?"
"Come in, Mr. Evans, not afraid of the dark, are you?"
You have to kill me Mr.
Evans, I know too much!
"Come in, Mr. Evans, come in Mr. Evans, today is the day. We're equal now..."
"I've been expecting you... not afraid of the dark are you? Not afraid of the dark are you?"
"Not afraid of the dark..." "Come in, Mr. Evans..."
"We're equal... Come in Mr. Evans."
Mr. Hannon!
Mr. Hannon!
Hannon!
Mr. Hannon!
Wait a minute, Bob!
Are you hurt, Mr. Hannon?
We heard the shots, what was it?
Was it Evans?
It was Evans alright, but I don't know.
Come here.
- It's a woman.
- It's MacDonald.
You mean that she, MacDonald and Evans are the same?
Of course, I told you. She smelled right, and she sounded right.
I should have thought of it long ago.
But if two people go past you and you smell perfume, and your told one is a man, you naturally think that the perfume is on the other.
I thought that till 3 minutes ago when I got hold of her slim wrist.
She's dead?
Yes.
I'm sorry.
Oh, you want another cup of coffee?
No, thanks, Jean.
Phil? There's one thing I want to know.
What's that?
When you sent me away last night, did you know that Evans was going to come here?
I didn't know. I just thought maybe.
The police were after a bunch of kidnappers, and I was after Evans.
And Evans was after me, not knowing how much I knew, or how soon I would figure it out.
Can you imagine that? Afraid of me, not of the police - me!
And yet you sent me away.
I had to, honey. Don't you see: I just had to get Evans.
I couldn't go after him, so he had to come to me. Don't you see?
Yes. But just the same,
I think you should have...
What sort of day is it? Foggy?
No. It's clear now.
Well, take me out on the roof and show me.
Come on.
Can't you lend a guy a helping hand who can't even see?
Well, sure!
What do you see?
Well, it's just the same as you remember it.
That's right. Just as I remember it.

Ugetsu monogatari by Ueda Akinari continues to enchant modern readers with its mysterious fantasies.
This film is a new refashioning of those fantasies.
Early Spring, 16th Century
The Age of Civil Wars
North shores of Lake Biwa in Omi Province
What could that be?
They must be executing
Shibata's spies.
I need to sell all this before the fighting starts.
Can you sell it in Nagahama?
I hear business is booming there since Lord Hashiba's forces arrived.
- Can't I go with you?
- No, no women.
There's no telling what lawless soldiers will get up to.
Besides, you have to stay and take care of little Genichi.
Go, then, if that's what you want!
Some samurai you'll make, you fool!
How high can a man rise without big dreams?
Ambition must be as boundless as the ocean.
You must be dreaming!
You can't even handle a sword.
You should stick to the trade you know or you'll regret it.
Just wait until I'm rich.
I swear by the god of war,
I'm tired of being poor.
Genjuro, please take me with you.
Still at it?
Forget your foolish dreams.
- Let me pull the cart.
- Stop it, you fool!
He's delusional, he thinks a big future awaits him in Nagahama.
What an idiot!
Back soon, Miyagi.
They're too greedy for their own good.
And not just Tobei. Genjuro, too.
I tell you, quick profits made in chaotic times never last.
A little money inflames men's greed.
They'd do better to prepare for the coming war.
- Tell Genjuro that when he returns.
- I shall.
Thank you for your advice.
Your father's back!
Welcome back.
Here...
Look!
- What's this?
- What do you think?
You got that for your wares?
Feel the weight of it.
Never seen so much, have you?
I hurried back just to show you.
That's what I call trade!
Now do you understand?
What about Tobei?
He came across a fine-looking samurai in Nagahama.
I tried to stop him, but he insisted on following the samurai.
I beg of you, sir! I beg of you!
Please, I beg of you, sir!
Let me be your vassal!
I'll serve you unto death, sir!
- Accept a beggar as a vassal?
- Get some armour first!
- Armour and a spear!
- Get lost, beggar!
Then can I be a samurai?
Get lost!
Not you again?
Get some armour and a spear!
You look so nice!
Happy now?
Very smart indeed.
It's like the Bon festival and New Year's all rolled into one.
For years I've wanted to buy you a kimono but I could never afford it.
Now I finally can!
Just look at your face.
You look so happy!
It's not the kimono but your kindness that makes me so happy.
As long as you're with me,
I want for nothing in life.
Just look at all this...
Dried fish, oil, flour, arrowroot and rice cakes.
Money is everything, see?
Without it life is hard, and all hope dies.
Well, your father's got work to do.
Up we go.
I will earn even more.
I'll try and make as much pottery as I can.
That last small batch brought in three silver coins.
That's enough talk of money.
We have plenty now.
The village chief says Lord Shibata's troops could be here by tomorrow.
We should be careful...
Nonsense!
War's always good for business.
Just look how much I made!
You were fortunate once.
You may not be next time.
- If anything happened to you...
- Stop imagining the worst.
Oh, Ohama...
- Brother...
- You mustn't worry.
No samurai would hire a peasant dressed in rags like him.
Don't you worry, he'll be back.
Have something to drink, here.
You fool!
Have you come to your senses?
You look like a beggar.
You've become the village idiot!
Keep it turning, come on.
Get him out of here!
He's in the way.
We won't make it if we don't hurry.
Stay out of the way, now.
Go and sit down.
Mother, I'm hungry.
What a pest!
Come on, come on, a few more turns!
You're a different man now, always so irritable.
All I want is for us to work in peace as husband and wife, and for the three of us to live happily.
That's all I wish for.
You really worked hard for me this time.
I have a plan, that's why.
Let's sell this new batch in Nagahama.
We'll make a fortune.
- Will I get a share?
- Of course. A third of all we sell.
I can't wait... I can't wait to get my hands on that money.
I've never seen those two work so hard before.
They've thrown everything into this kiln, their strength, their souls, everything.
I don't know what will become of them if it all fails.
Living together as a happy family is enough for me.
But he insists on taking this risk.
Men just won't listen, will they?
Genjuro was always so level-headed before.
War changes people, doesn't it?
At least they're trying to bring in some money.
I wonder what that is.
Wake up, dear. Wake up.
The rumour was true.
They must be Shibata's troops.
See anything, Tobei?
The villagers are scattering like spiders!
- What now?
- We must keep the kiln burning.
I'll be damned if I let that fire go out.
They're pillaging houses and rounding up men.
Genichi!
It's Shibata's army! Hurry, run!
Hurry, hurry!
Hurry!
Halt! We're taking men for forced labour! Don't try to resist!
This is terrible! Run for your lives!
Lord Shibata's troops are here!
They're stealing everything!
Hide your valuables!
- Don't let them get your women!
- Hurry!
They're taking all men into forced labour!
- They're requisitioning everything!
- They're like a pack of wolves.
If only they'd waited one more night!
Hurry, let's run.
It's too dangerous here. Hurry!
If we lose this batch,
I won't get my share of the profits!
You'll lose your life for that kiln!
Come on!
Come now, quickly!
Boil some rice.
We'll need it in the mountains.
Ohama! Ohama, come quickly!
Mother!
Trying to hide, eh?
Come out, damn you!
Help! Please! Help!
Please have mercy! Don't take them!
Don't leave us to starve!
We're begging you!
No, please! No!
Out of my way!
Out of the way, fool!
Help!
It's ready. Here...
Thank you.
Hurry and eat.
- What's happened to him?
- Hopeless fool!
- Have you seen my husband?
- No, I haven't.
Who's there?
It's really quietened down.
The guns are almost silent.
Where are you going?
It's too dangerous.
Wait until the soldiers leave.
Wait. It's best to wait.
I can't wait! I have to go!
- Please don't go!
- I can't let the fire go out!
Forget the kiln!
What if you're caught?
- I can't let the fire go out!
- We can always make more pots.
Silence!
I can't let the pots be ruined.
Ohama! Ohama!
Damn it! The fire's gone out.
- Dear...
- Too late. The fire's gone out.
Damn, it's empty!
- What was that? Is someone hiding?
- Could be something hidden in there.
Have a look.
Nothing but pots.
Let's go.
They're done!
Look! They're fired!
Thank goodness they're done!
They're done!
Thank goodness.
Are they done?
Yes, they are!
And very nicely, too.
- Hurry and load them up.
- So we're off to Nagahama, then?
We can't now.
We'll row across the lake.
Ohama's a boatman's daughter.
You do the rowing, okay?
- Can we get to the lake safely?
- We'll take a shortcut to Onoe.
Will we find a boat?
There are always abandoned ones there.
Hurry, let's unload the kiln.
In the waters of Azuchi
A little boat floats along
All are asleep
Slumped over the rudder...
We've got to be careful, the fog is thick.
Genichi, this is the lake.
Isn't it beautiful?
We're finally out of danger.
I'm glad we decided to go by boat.
If we'd gone overland, we'd probably be dead by now.
We'll reach Omizo by morning.
That's where Lord Niwa has his castle.
The town's even more prosperous than Nagahama.
You and I will be rich men, and our wives will be wealthy women.
I'll build a warehouse in our village.
And I'll buy a suit of armour.
Another boat!
It's a ghost!
No... I'm not a ghost.
I'm a boatman from Kaizu.
I was on the way to Azuchi with my cargo, when I was attacked by pirates.
Water...
Give me water!
Thank you.
Wherever you're headed, be on the lookout for pirates.
If they see you, you'll lose your cargo and your lives.
Take care of your women.
Your women...
Merciful Buddha!
Buddha have mercy on his soul.
Let's turn back.
This is a bad omen.
Let's return the women to shore.
We'll continue alone.
- Please don't go.
- I'm staying... to keep my eye on him.
- They kidnap women.
- I'll risk it.
I'll go wherever you go.
Please take me with you.
- You must look after Genichi.
- Take me with you!
Ohama, take us back to shore.
Quickly!
Tobei, take us back!
We'll be back with the money soon.
We'll return within ten days.
Wait for us.
Don't try to fight if pirates overtake you.
I know, I know.
Don't take the main road.
Remember what I said and take the mountain path.
And don't go back home right away.
Understand?
These misfortunes will soon be over.
Just be patient.
Tobei, Ohama, please look after him for me.
Don't worry, we'll be back soon.
Take good care of Genichi.
You'll be surprised at all the silver we bring back.
Father!
Please be careful!
Come back safely!
- Father!
- Please be careful!
Father!
Buy our wares! Buy our wares!
Tea bowls! Tea bowls!
This? Here you go. Many thanks.
- Sake flasks and cups, too!
- Buy our wares!
- I'd like that vase, please.
- This one, yes?
And that sake flask and those cups.
And can we also take those rice bowls, plates and jars?
Yes... rice bowls, plates and jars.
We live at Kutsuki Manor.
Please deliver them there.
We will pay you then.
Thank you.
- The castle guard approaches!
- Make way for the castle guard!
Don't look!
You'll only get your crazy ideas again.
Shut up!
If I had armour, I could be a samurai.
Sword, spear, armour...
Don't throw away our hard-earned money.
- Leave me alone!
- Brother!
- Tobei!
- Let go of me!
Next time we meet,
I'll be a great samurai.
Please stop him!
Tobei! Tobei!
That got rid of her.
- May I help you?
- A suit of armour, please!
Tobei!
- Do I look like a samurai?
- Yes, and a fine one.
- But you need a spear.
- I'll take one!
Here you are.
How much?
One silver piece.
Pretty, isn't she?
Let me go!
What are you doing?
Damn you!
Murderers!
There's some money for you.
Bastards!
Look what's become of me.
Satisfied now, Tobei, seeing your wife reduced to this?
What do you care, anyway, now you think you're a samurai?
Tobei, you wretched fool!
You fool, Tobei!
Would you watch over my stall until my partners return?
- Of course.
- They should be back soon. Thanks.
Sir, how much is one of these?
Are you looking to buy?
Depends on the price.
They're too luxurious for the wife of a man like you.
I've got money.
Excuse me.
We thought you might need us to show you the way.
That's very kind of you.
Please follow us.
Please come in.
Well... Thank you, but I should be getting back.
Lady Wakasa is waiting for you.
Please come inside.
You say "Lady Wakasa"...
Are you referring to the young lady?
Yes, she is the daughter of the late Lord Kutsuki.
Now please come through.
No need to stand on ceremony.
Many thanks.
Come through.
Please...
Please, come.
You are Master Genjuro of Omi province, are you not?
How does your ladyship know my name?
When I saw your ceramics at the market,
I could hardly believe my eyes.
The blue glaze on your pots gleamed as brightly as crystal.
My father taught me a certain appreciation of such things.
I wanted to meet you, to ask how you manage to create such beautiful objects.
But perhaps it is a trade secret, not meant for outsiders?
No, my lady, there is no special trade secret.
But it takes many years' experience to handle the clay and apply the glaze.
The fruit of experience is beauty, but only a master craftsman can create such beauty.
Thank you, my lady.
These are my wares, aren't they?
I wanted to taste sake from your cups.
You're fortunate, my little ones, to catch this noble lady's eye.
I'm a farmer, so the pottery is just a sideline, but I feel for my creations, as if they were my own children.
That such a noble lady would look kindly upon them is a great honour.
To see them in such a grand residence, graced by the touch of so beautiful a lady, is like a dream come true.
Not at all. They must be saddened by the touch of one fallen on hard times, such as myself.
Please, take a cup.
My wares have never looked so beautiful.
The value of people and objects truly depends on their setting.
My wares must be at a loss to find themselves in such a noble manor.
Your talent must not be hidden away in some poor, remote village.
You must strive to deepen and enrich your gift.
And how might I do that, my lady?
By swearing your love for Lady Wakasa, and pledging your troth to her at once.
The finest silk
Of choicest hue
May change and fade away
As would my life
My beloved
If thou shouldst prove untrue
Our vow to love for a thousand years... is sealed with this cup...
His voice sounds overjoyed!
That is the voice of my late father.
The entire House of Kutsuki was wiped out by Oda Nobunaga, that detestable Oda Nobunaga.
The only survivors of the purge were her ladyship and myself, her nurse.
But the spirit of the late daimyo lingers in the palace, and it sings like this every time her ladyship dances.
Is it not a splendid voice?
He's expressing his delight at her ladyship's impending marriage.
Whenever I hear the voice of my late father...
It's too early to rise.
Please sleep as long as you like.
What am I doing here?
What a thing to say...
...as if you'd forgotten everything.
Is my lord awake?
Lead your husband by the hand to the spring and bathe him.
I won't intrude upon you any further.
You have such a look of distrust on your face.
You think I'm some kind of enchantress, don't you?
But you're mine, you belong to me now.
From now on, you must devote your entire life to me.
This love
This love of ours has driven me to madness...
Even if you are a ghost or enchantress,
I'll never let you go.
I never imagined such pleasures existed.
This is exquisite! It's paradise!
Help me! Help me!
Somebody, please help!
Someone, help me!
See any food?
Quickly, quickly!
Pull yourself together.
Come with me.
Come quickly!
- Take these rice cakes and this.
- I'll never forget your kindness.
You'll be all right if you take the back road.
- To the left.
- Many thanks.
Be careful.
Here!
It's mine!
- Hey... you got any food?
- We're starving to death.
That food's for my son.
Please don't take it!
Do me the honour of beheading me.
I've brought you a head! A head!
A general's head!
Please, my lord!
- What is it?
- Please look at this!
You found the head of a great general.
No, I didn't find it, my lord.
I killed him with my spear!
Who'd believe a warrior like Fuwa Katsuhige would let a mere foot soldier kill him?
A lucky find, but you'll be rewarded all the same.
What would you like?
A horse, armour and vassals.
Very well. You shall have them.
Thank you, my lord!
You're a clever one, aren't you?
He looks like a fine samurai.
What clan does he belong to?
- He killed Fuwa, the great general.
- What's his name?
Tobei of Nakanogo, one of Lord Niwa's top men.
Pay homage, that you may be so lucky.
Beautiful girls are waiting for brave warriors!
We have the finest sake and fish!
Please come inside!
I can't let you pass, sir!
Come and look.
We have beautiful girls inside.
- What's going on?
- Chief, perhaps we can rest here.
No, I'm heading directly home.
I have someone waiting for me, and she must see me in all my glory.
Chief, why not let us celebrate your triumph?
- Your men are looking forward to it.
- I see. Very well.
I, Nakanogo Tobei of Lord Niwa's army, will rest here.
- Prepare some tables.
- He'll rest here. Show your gratitude.
Thank you, sir.
Make way!
Clear the way for Master Tobei!
Welcome.
- Which one is this Tobei?
- Him, over there.
Him?
I heard of his great exploits.
May I drink from your cup so your luck rubs off on me?
Me, too!
How did you manage to kill such a great general?
Yes, tell us, so we may do as you did!
A guide for future action!
There's nothing much to tell.
First, you need brains.
You need knowledge.
Then, a strong arm.
Skill on the battlefield.
Martial artistry.
Speed to seize the moment.
The ability to see life in perspective.
Then you'll be wise as Kongming, the great Chinese military strategist.
But above all, keep a clear, discerning mind.
- Got that?
- Indeed.
For military tactics, study the Kusunoki and Koshu schools.
For firearms, Kanamaru school.
For the spear, Otsubo school.
Next you need to know fortifications and fortresses.
Then defensive tactics,
V-formations and the like...
Hey! My money!
Let me go!
Crazy bitch!
- Someone stop him!
- Hey, what's going on?
- Let go of me!
- He's trying to run off like a thief!
I don't give money to wenches like you.
Scoundrel!
Making a plaything of me.
This will do just fine, thanks!
Ohama! Ohama!
So you're the big man now?
You've finally become the great samurai of your dreams, eh?
While you've made your way to the top,
I've made quite a name for myself.
In my fancy kimono and make-up, drinking fine sake,
I bed a different man every night.
Some success for a woman, isn't it?
Happy now?
This is what you wanted.
Success always comes at a price, and we pay in suffering.
I may be a fallen woman, but your success wipes the slate clean.
Come!
Be my customer tonight and we'll celebrate.
Buy this fallen woman with your money!
Ohama.
Without you, my success means nothing.
That's a lie! My fate meant nothing, as long as you became a samurai.
No, no, no, you're wrong.
Ohama!
I thought you'd be proud if I made good.
I never dreamed you'd be brought to this.
I'm a defiled woman.
And you're to blame!
- Can you restore my honour?
- I can.
- Otherwise, I have to die!
- I can!
I swear I'll restore your honour.
How many times I've wanted to die, but I had to see you first!
I hated myself for it, I hated myself, but I couldn't die without seeing you first!
I couldn't die... I couldn't die!
This...
...and this. Thank you.
I don't quite have enough.
Could you lower the price?
In that case, I'll take this back.
I really wanted that.
Come to Kutsuki Manor and I'll pay you the rest.
- Kutsuki Manor?
- Yes, at the foot of the mountain.
Take it all, and go away!
Keep your money, too. Just go away!
- Wait.
- How can I help you, Priest?
I sense something evil... an ill omen.
- What is it?
- Let me look closely at your face.
- My face?
- Yes.
We can't talk here.
Please follow me.
Very well...
The shadow of death is upon your face.
Has some strange apparition crossed your path, perhaps?
No, not at all.
Have you no home, no family?
If others depend on you, you must return to them at once.
If you remain here any longer, you will forfeit your life.
Return home quickly.
But why?
Do not ask the reason.
Your life is at stake.
But I spend my days happily with Lady Wakasa at Kutsuki Manor.
- She is a spirit of the dead.
- What nonsense.
This love of yours is forbidden.
Do you not love your wife and child?
Would you forsake your life and abandon them, too?
Wait!
Go then, if you must, but I cannot let you walk into the jaws of death.
I will exorcise this ghost.
Come.
When you realise how terrifying this spirit is, you'll come to your senses.
Oh... how beautiful!
Such lovely jewellery!
You've made me so happy!
How thoughtful of you, sir.
I'm so relieved.
You were so late in returning that I grew terribly worried.
But you look troubled, my dear.
What has happened?
What is it?
You must not leave here again.
Since the fall of our clan, people have treated us with nothing but contempt and slander our name.
What a wretched world!
Genjuro,
I want you never to leave my side again.
Let's leave this manor and return to my native province.
Genjuro, you are my husband for life.
You will accompany me, won't you?
Please forgive me.
I've been...
I've been lying to you.
I have a wife and child.
I left them back home in the chaos of the war.
You must leave all that behind you now.
Please let me go!
No!
I refuse to let you go.
So, you will come with me to my native province...
...immediately.
What is it, my lady?
- He has something on his skin!
- His skin?
Genjuro, did you...?
- Did you...?
- On your skin?
You must wash away what's on your skin!
Why did you wed her if you were already married?
I don't know... How could I have made such a terrible mistake?
A mistake for a man perhaps, but for a woman, it's far worse.
Please forgive me.
Let me go.
Certainly not!
Wipe off those Sanskrit prayers to the Buddha and that curse, or we will never forgive you!
Genjuro, how could you even think of doing something so dreadful?
All I wish is to remain forever by your side.
For all eternity.
Lady Wakasa departed this world without ever having known love in her life.
It grieved my heart to see her so sorrowful.
I wanted her ladyship to enjoy fully the pleasures of a woman's life, so I chose to return with her, to wander this world.
Our hopes were fulfilled when she met a good man like you and found a love that occurs only once a lifetime.
And now, when she has at last found joy, you speak of returning home, never to see each other again.
Does it not pain you to know that you may ruin her ladyship's only chance of happiness?
Do you feel no remorse?
Master Genjuro, you must banish these dreadful thoughts and stay by her side forever...
Please forgive me! Forgive me!
Genjuro!
Genjuro!
This is the man!
Hey, you! Get up!
- What are you doing?
- You shameless thief!
You stole a sacred treasure from the shrine.
- You're wrong! I didn't steal it.
- Silence!
This sacred sword disappeared a month ago.
That can't be! It belongs to Lady Wakasa at Kutsuki Manor.
- Kutsuki Manor, you say?
- That's right!
You must've been dreaming.
This is where it stood before the clan was wiped out.
He's lying through his teeth!
Where in the manor did you find the sword?
He's suspicious. Search him.
That's my money!
Give it back!
Silence! In peace time, we'd throw you in jail, but Shibata's army burned it down.
Be thankful for that, you lucky bastard.
The finest silk
Of choicest hue
May change and fade away
As would my life
My beloved
Miyagi.
Miyagi!
- I'm sorry I was gone so long.
- You're back!
I knew you'd be worried about me.
But you're all right...
I'm so happy to see you're all right.
- Genichi?
- He's asleep.
Let me hold him, let me hold him.
Genichi...
Genichi, I'm back! I'm back!
Your father's returned.
Let me hold you, let me hold you...
I wanted to bring you back fine presents, but this is all I have.
I... I made a terrible mistake!
Don't say another word, my dear.
You've returned safely to us.
I realise now how right you were.
My mind was warped.
Let's not speak of it anymore.
You must be exhausted.
I have some sake prepared.
And there's a stew ready in the pot.
I feel so relieved.
Sake never tasted so good.
It's so peaceful here.
Come, Genichi.
I'll put you to bed.
I haven't had a moment's peace since I left here, but I'm home at last... home at last...
Home at last... home at last...
Is someone in there?
Open the door!
Is someone in there?
Open up.
- Village chief!
- Genjuro! You're back?
Yes. Thank you for all your kindness in my absence.
Oh, there you are, my boy!
I was worried,
I didn't know where you'd gone.
What a relief.
What a relief.
The boy must have heard you were back.
Hey, Miyagi...
Miyagi!
Genjuro...
Are you dreaming?
Dreaming?
Miyagi was killed by soldiers of the defeated army.
Killed?
She'd have been so happy to see you back safely.
Poor thing.
Merciful Buddha...
Ever since Miyagi died,
I've been looking after your boy in my house.
I was so afraid when he suddenly disappeared last night.
The bond between parent and child is strong.
But how could he have known that you'd returned?
To hell with this... and this...
...and this!
I told you so, but you were too stupid to learn except through misfortune.
The war drove us mad with ambition.
Don't let my suffering be in vain.
Pull yourself together and work hard.
Why did you have to die?
Miyagi, why did you have to die?
I did not die.
I am at your side.
Your delusion has come to an end
You are again your true self in the place where you belong.
Your work is waiting...
What a beautiful shape!
Helping you spin the wheel is my greatest pleasure.
How I long to see it when it's fired
The firewood is cut and ready
The rampaging soldiers are gone.
$0 make your wonderful pottery in peace.
50 many things have happened
You've finally become the man I had hoped for.
But alas
..I am no longer among the living.
Such is the way of the world.
You must be tired. Rest a while.
Here, Genichi. It's delicious.
Eat it while it's hot.
Brother, eat before it gets cold.
Cornelia Van Gorder
(Voiceover): This is the Oaks, a house in the country which
I rented for the summer.
As an author, I write tales of mystery and murder.
But the things that happened in this house were far more fantastic than any story I've ever had published.
I brought a staff of servants from my city apartment, and my maid Lizzy Allen who had been with me nearly 20 years.
Lizzy?
Yes, Miss Cornelia?
Cornelia Van Gorder:
Is the car ready?
It's at the door.
Look.
Hm?
Miss Cornelia, them servants you brought from the apartment are talking about walking out on us.
Really?
Well, I know they don't like it here.
But I didn't think it was that bad.
Well, they've been hearing things about the killer that the police call the Bat, and the murders that he committed here this past winter.
Now people are saying he's back again.
Well, how can they be sure of that?
Has he committed another crime?
No, not yet, but that ain't saying that he won't.
Here's something else.
You've heard about the bats they have here--
Animal bats, the kind that fly.
Yes, yes.
Look what it says in this magazine.
This is a report from the state health department.
And it says some of them bats is rabid.
Well.
And that ain't all.
Now there's a rumor going around that it was the Bat himself, the killer I mean, that released the rabid bats in this neighborhood.
Oh, that's ridiculous.
Well, the housekeeper, the cook, the butler, and the upstairs maid don't think so.
Well, I can't help what they think.
If hysterical nonsense like that can scare them out of their good jobs, it's their loss not mine.
Come on, Lizzy.
I've got to get to the bank.
Drive directly to
Zenith bank, Warner.
I'm afraid we'll have to hurry.
It's near closing time.
I'll get you there,
Miss Van Gorder.
Thanks again.
Miss Van Gorder!
How are you doing, Mr. Bailey?
How are you?
I'm very well, thank you.
You remember Lizzy Allen?
Of course, hello, Miss Allen.
How do you do?
So you're spending the summer with us again?
Yes, yes, I've leased the
Oaks, the home of your bank president, John Fleming.
I heard you had.
I was surprised.
Why?
Is there something the matter with it?
No, I was surprised because Mr. Fleming said he would never rent it.
Oh?
Well I rented it from his nephew mark
Fleming who has the real estate office here.
He said his uncle would be gone the entire summer.
That's right.
Mr. Fleming's in the north woods now, with his physician
Dr. Wells.
Oh, pardon me.
Dale?
I want you to meet my wife.
We were married at Christmas time.
That must have been nice.
Believe me, it was.
Oh, here she is-- my wife,
Ms. Van Gorder, Ms. Allen.
How do you do?
How do you do?
Cornelia Van Gorder.
Yes.
Oh, well I've read every murder mystery you've ever written.
I just adored that weird one, the private morgue of Dr. X, even though it gave me the shivers.
Only the shivers?
Scared hell out of me.
Oh.
Well, I really need that
Miss Corny killed them off in that one.
When you refer to my books, please don't call me Miss Corny.
Pardon me, Mr. Bailey.
My.
Hynes is here to see you.
Oh yes, excuse me, please.
Don't be strangers now.
No, no we won't.
Oh, so you're a bride?
Well, not quite.
Not since Christmas.
I'm sure I've seen you.
Well, I-- I used to be my husband's secretary here in the bank.
Cornelia Van Gorder:
Of course, I remember.
May I welcome our most distinguished visitor back to Zenith?
Oh, that's very charming.
But, um--
Lieutenant Anderson.
Lieutenant Anderson, of course, chief of detectives of the
Zenith police department.
This is Miss Allen.
How do you do?
Lieutenant Anderson is one of our favorite citizens.
He's on the bank's board of directors.
Not bad for a policeman.
You must have made a good thing of it.
Well, I saved my money, if that's what you mean.
It's near closing time.
And I've got some business in the safe deposit vault. Please come and see me, Mrs. Bailey.
Oh, I'd love to.
And you, Lieutenant.
Thank you.
Goodbye.
Goodbye, nice to have met you.
My, what a charming woman.
She moved into the Oaks just the other day.
That house is a proper sitting for a writer of mysteries.
Oh, it certainly is.
Dick, what's the matter?
Come in here, both of you.
Andy, we're in trouble.
Wendell hynes came in to pick up $350,000 worth of bonds that we were holding as collateral for a loan.
They were kept in our special fault.
Mr. Fleming and I are the only officers of the bank who have access to that vault.
So?
The hynes bonds are gone.
That's not all.
Other negotiable securities are missing.
From what I can gather short of a careful check, the bank has been looted of over a million dollars worth of securities.
You'll have to notify Fleming.
I wish I could talk to him.
Unfortunately, he and Dr.
Wells are deep in the woods.
They can't be reached by phone.
What is it?
I thought I heard someone on the path coming from the lake, had an idea it might be that guide of ours.
Oh, Sam won't show up until morning.
It's a 20-mile canoe trip from here to civilization.
Five will get you 10
Sam has a message for me.
I thought you told them at the bank not to bother you.
I did.
But they'll bother me.
Doctor?
Yes, John.
What would you do for half a million?
Anything short of murder.
Why not murder?
Too messy.
Dr. hynes: Too great a risk?
For half a million?
Yes.
I pinched a million from the bank.
I'm not kidding.
I embezzled it.
Not that I think you wouldn't do it if you thought you could get away with it.
I got away with it.
I'm not talking about currency.
I took negotiable securities that could be converted into cash.
I have the cash, in tens, twenties, and hundreds.
I'm your doctor, not your lawyer.
Why tell me this?
You'll find out why.
Who's going to take the blame for the robbery?
Bailey, the cashier,l they'll never suspect me.
I like Bailey.
Well, so do i. I love the guy.
I gave him his first chance.
He has a lovely little wife.
Charming girl, I was the best man.
Where's the million?
In my family's tomb in Zenith, in the crypt with my father's casket.
I don't buy that, John.
No?
No, you forget that
I had you in charge when you were a very sick man, when you raved in delirium.
And I heard you talk about a hidden room.
Now, where else could you put a hidden room except in that mansion you built, that white elephant you call the Oaks?
Look, everyone knows
I have a bad heart.
Who would doubt it if you wired the bank directors that my heart had failed, that
I had fallen from a great height here in the woods, and that
I was badly smashed up?
You could ship the body back for burial, and instruct them not to open the casket due to the condition of its contents.
Well, you realize, of course, that we'd have to have a body to put in that casket, which means that we'd have to deal with an undertaker at this end.
Of course.
But where do we get a body?
Couldn't we provide one of our own?
How about Sam?
Sam?
Our guide?
Sam weighs about as much as I do.
He's practically a hermit.
He wouldn't be missed for a long time.
The local undertaker would know him.
Dr. hynes: Not if we made him look as if he'd been in a serious accident.
But if Bailey's going to take the blame, why do you have to do this?
A jury might acquit him.
In that case, I'd be a logical suspect.
I could disappear, of course.
But it's safer if they think I'm dead.
What if I don't go for this deal?
In that case, it would be two bad.
You mean you'd kill me?
What else could I do?
Now that I've told you about the million.
I'd say you were shot in a hunting accident.
Now, look, doctor, it you can find another body instead of Sam's, it's all right with me.
There's half a million in it for you.
I'll do my best.
I smell smoke.
So do i. What's that noise?
Look, doctor!
The woods are on fire!
It's coming this way!
We've got to get out of here!
Out the back way!
We will, as soon as
I provide that body we were talking about.
Oh, my goodness dear,
Lizzie, is that you?
Yes, Miss cordelia.
There's a storm coming up.
And it's going to be a snorter.
The wind nearly blew the door off its hinges.
Well, that noise blew my game higher than a kite.
I think I've lost some of the cards.
Oh, I'll get them for you.
Oh, I see you've found the paper.
Drat that paper boy, scooting by on his bicycle, just chucked it into a couple bushes and let it go at that.
For land's sake, Mr. Vick
Bailey's been arrested.
Oh?
Right there.
Victor Bailey, vice president and cashier of the Zenith bank, was arraigned before united states commissioner Alvin fielding charged with the embezzlement of over $1 million.
I can't believe Vick
Bailey had anything to do with that robbery.
Oh, well, I see our landlord is home again.
Landlord?
Mr. Fleming, Dr. Malcolm
Wells is back in town with the body of John
Fleming, president of the Zenith bank, who was killed in a forest fire.
Mr. Fleming will be laid to rest in his family's tomb on Friday.
And I hope he stays there.
Why shouldn't he?
Well, this is his house.
And ever since he died, some funny things have happened here.
For instance?
The housekeeper, the cook, and the butler said that they heard strange noises at night.
And the upstairs maid swore that she met a man without a face coming up the back stairs.
Oh, so that's why they quit and left me to run this place without a staff.
They didn't tell you, Ms. Corny.
But the truth is, they were scared to stay.
But you're still here, Lizzie.
Haven't you seen anything?
No, no, and even if I had,
I ain't afraid of ghosts.
They're afraid of me.
Honest, Ms. Corny, a spiritualist told me once that ghosts was allergic to me.
But-- but this Bat feller they keep talking about in the paper,
I-- I guess he'd be different.
I don't think you would have the same effect on him.
Oh dear.
What are they trying to do, drive people away from this part of the country?
Why?
What does it say about the Bat?
His specialty seems to be killing women-- my goodness, two of them in one night.
All his victims died the same way, like their throats had been ripped open with steel claws.
Well, that's a charming little caper.
I'll have to try it sometime.
In a book.
That aint' nothing, just something bumping against the house.
That's just the wind banging a door.
Pay no attention to it.
Listen to this, one of his victims who lived for a moment after she was found, described the Bat as a man without a face.
Honest, Ms. Corny,
I think that woman must have been exaggerating.
That's just that heavy tapestry at the top of the stairs.
I know.
I know.
I've heard it before on a windy night.
But that sounds as if there was someone on the stairs.
I know there isn't, at least there shouldn't be.
There ain't.
Them's just the noises you here in any old house on a windy night.
It says here that the Bat never leaves no fingerprints.
That's understandable.
Having no face, he probably has no fingers either.
Lizzie!
And that, I suppose, is the cat dropping its dentures?
No, no, I don't think so.
But I think it's something should be looked into.
Now, who chucked him down here?
The wind, I hope.
There must be a window open up there.
No, Lizzie!
Let him lay.
Let him sleep it off.
I hope the power lines don't go down, put the lights out.
We'll check the windows in the living room, and drawn the curtains, and then we'll go to bed.
Yes, ma'am.
I won't be a minute.
Ms. Corny!
What was that?
Oh, when I went to get the paper, I turned the latch off.
I forgot to turn it on again.
He's out there.
He was coming in.
He might have got you.
Oh, but he didn't.
And he's still out there, thanks to you.
Now, you hurry now, and we'll call the police.
No, no, I won't leave you, Ms. Corny.
Are you ok?
Yes, ma'am, I'm ok.
Ok.
Operator: Operator?
Give me the police department, please.
Officer: Zenith police department.
This is Cornelia Van Gorder.
I'm living at the Oaks.
We know about that,
Ms. Van Gorder.
Just a moment ago, a man tried to force his way into this house.
Officer: You're not alone there, are you?
What about your servants?
Well, I have none except my chauffeur.
And he's away.
He won't be back until the morning.
Now, there's only two of us here tonight.
And we're going to lock ourselves in my room.
Now, uh, if-- if any of your men see anything, will you have them call me?
Officer: I'll send officers over there right away.
Well, thank you very much.
Come on, Lizzie.
We're going to sleep in my room.
Well, nothing can get at us in this room now, I don't think.
This door seems good and solid.
Like the door to a tomb.
Uh, I think that couch will be comfortable.
There's some extra bedding, you know, in the closet.
Let's see now.
Oh, uh-huh, no bolt.
Well, that's not so good.
What's that for?
That, my good woman, is a boobie trap.
If anybody tries to open this transom, this'll be knocked off.
And we'll hear it fall.
Oh, fiddlesticks, I forgot my night things, my robe, my gown, and my slippers.
I'll go get them now.
Now, wait a minute, Lizzie.
I'll go with you--
Now don't you bother, Ms. Cornelia.
My room's just down the hall.
Cornelia Van Gorder:
Lizzie, I told you to wait!
It's all right.
I'll only be a second.
Get in here!
Get in here!
Yes?
Officer: Miss Van Gorder?
Yes.
Officer: Zenith police department.
There's a police car just outside your house.
And the officers in it have reported that there's no sign of a prowler anywhere well, the man's inside now!
He's in the hall just outside my bedroom!
Have your men break through the kitchen door and search this place from top to bottom.
Officer: Ok, Ms. Van
Gorder, sit tight.
I will.
I have a gun.
And I know how to use it.
Oh, relax, relax, Lizzie.
The police did a good job.
They couldn't find anybody in here.
But we both saw him, Ms. Cornelia.
All right, all right, so he got away.
But there are men on guard outside.
So just try and get some rest.
There's nothing can get at us here.
Oh, oh, oh, Miss cordelia!
Miss cordelia!
What?
What's the matter?
A bat!
Oh, nonsense, you've had a nightmare.
Maybe I did.
But there was a bat.
And it bit me.
What?
It flew in that closet.
Oh, good gracious, Lizzie.
You're right!
Operator, operator, will you get me Dr. Malcolm Wells' office, please.
I don't know his number.
And I have no phone book up here.
But this is an emergency.
Will you connect me with his office, please?
Oh dear, oh dear, I'm going to get the rabies.
Woman: Hello?
Hello?
Dr. well's office.
Woman: This is a call service.
Dr. Wells is out at moment.
But if you give me your name and number, I'll try to locate him.
Well, this is Miss
Van Gorder of the Oaks.
My maid has just been bitten by a bat that may be rapid.
And she must have treatment as soon as possible.
And I was told that Dr. Wells was the nearest physician.
Woman: I'll try to find him for you.
And I can't, I'll send you another doctor.
Well, thank you very much.
Oh, he's out on a case.
Oh.
I hope it's not a delivery-- a baby, I mean.
They can be terribly complicated.
It never bothered me none.
Oh, Lizzie, you never had a baby.
Of course I didn't.
That's why they never bothered me.
Oh, does it hurt, huh?
A little.
Operator: Dr. Wells?
Are you there Dr. Wells?
Are you there, Dr. Wells?
This is the operator.
Your call service is on the wire.
It's an emergency.
This is Dr. Wells.
Woman: This is your call service, doctor.
Oh, hello I-- I was just doing an experiment.
I left the receiver off.
Woman: That's what I thought, but I kept trying.
Ms. Van Gorder at the Oaks called and said that her maid had been bitten by a bit.
And she's afraid it might be rapid.
What?
Oh, all right, tell her
I'll be right over there.
Who's there?
Dr. Wells: Dr. Wells.
Come in.
Good evening.
Oh, I'm so glad they found you, doctor.
Well, I reached my office shortly after you called.
How is your maid?
Is she in any pain?
No, no, she doesn't seem to be.
Did the bat get away?
No.
I believe it's still in my bedroom.
Oh, good, I'll want to examine it.
There you go, Ms. Allen.
Now you'll feel better.
Doctor, have I got the rabies?
Well, I can tell you better after I've examined the bat's brain under a microscope.
That thing's got a brain?
Oh, you'd be surprised.
Where is it?
I think the little darling is in that closet.
Oh.
You know, it's a pity you leased this house, Ms. Van Gorder.
Why a pity?
Well, my dear lady, I don't want to alarm you, but--
Oh, well after tonight, nothing can alarm me.
Yes, I understand.
It must have been terrifying.
So many unexplainable things have happened here.
There's something about the place.
Your servants must have sensed it when they walked out on you, an apprehension of disaster.
Well, let's see.
Ah-ha!
Yes, there he is.
All right now, take it easy, nobody's going to hurt you, quiet now, quiet.
Looks quite normal, doesn't seem to be sick at all.
Ain't that nice.
I've been worried about him.
Well, you should be.
From his appearance,
I'd say that he doesn't have any infection, in which case you've had a narrow escape.
Now, you take one of those tablets
I left for you and I guarantee you a good night.
And I'll drop in on you tomorrow.
Oh, thanks for everything, doctor.
But I can find my way out.
I know you can.
But do let me help you.
Oh, don't forget that once I'm gone, you'll have to climb those stairs alone.
Oh, I'm all right.
I'm armed now.
Can you shoot one of those things without shutting your eyes?
Oh, doctor, there are guns in every book I've ever written.
I don't write about things
I'm unfamiliar with.
Lock the door, Lizzie.
Goodnight.
Yes, ma'am, good night, doctor.
Accident?
No, no, the wind blew him down, I think.
Oh.
Did you know that young mark
Fleming leased you this house without notifying his uncle?
No, no, I didn't.
Well, it doesn't matter now.
John Fleming is dead.
And mark's his heir.
But if John were alive, he would warn you to leave here, Miss Van Gorder.
Really?
Yes.
It's been a tragic place for anyone who ever lived in it.
Well, goodnight.
Goodnight, doctor.
Who's out there?
Nobody you need to worry about, doctor.
Oh, it's Andy.
That's right.
Good evening, Miss Van Gorder.
Good evening, Lieutenant.
Somebody sick here?
My maid was bitten by a bat.
Oh?
A rabid bat?
Well, I'll know for sure when I get to my lab.
I-- I caught the bat.
It happened indoors?
In my bedroom.
How'd it get in?
Well there are ways a bat could get in a house.
You ought to know.
I, uh, I spotted this hole in the window the minute
I got there.
That's where the two-legged bat got your door open.
Miss Van Gorder told me that she phoned headquarters at Zenith.
Yes, I phoned twice.
The second time was after the prowler got in the house.
Were you in headquarters, Andy?
No, but they contacted me.
An officer came and searched the house from top to bottom.
But they couldn't find the bat.
You better have this window fixed tomorrow.
Oh, yes, I certainly shall.
Yes, and I-- I better be going.
I'm due in surgery at 8 o'clock in the morning.
Goodnight.
Goodnight, doctor.
There will be a man patrolling the grounds all night,
Ms. Van Gorder.
Oh, thank you.
And nobody inside, Andy?
Why should there be?
Well, how do you know but what the bat is hiding somewhere in the house?
I'm quite sure he isn't in the house, doctor, not now.
Goodnight.
Goodnight.
Hi, Andy.
Hello, mark.
Well, congratulations, real estate business must be picking up-- new office, new furniture.
New deal, how do you like it?
It looks expensive.
Are you squandering your inheritance?
Oh, I haven't got it yet.
Well, the paper says John
Fleming left his entire fortune to you.
Funny thing about that entire fortune is that we can't find it.
No kidding?
No, all uncle John has in his bank account was a couple hundred dollars.
And his safe deposit box was empty.
If we don't find that missing million, mine will be empty too.
How come?
Well, all my savings were invested in Zenith bank stock.
The examiners won't certify the bank as solvent until those stolen securities are found.
So the stockholders have voted an assessment that'll wipe some of us out.
It's as is those securities have been converted into cash.
And if I can't find that cash, I'm sunk.
Well, where are you going to look for it, Andy?
Here in Zenith.
Your uncle wouldn't take a million on a hunting trip, would he?
You suspect uncle John?
Why, Andy, he founded the Zenith back.
That'd be like robbing the family tomb.
You think he wouldn't?
Well, besides, Vick
Bailey's fingerprints are all over the vault.
They didn't find any of uncle John's fingerprints.
Because he wiped them off.
Can the defense prove that.
They'll try to.
Judie Holland had Bailey's secretary as a defense witness.
And they believe her testimony will have a powerful effect on the jury.
Well, she has a powerful effect on me.
Judie's a doll.
Here's the book you mentioned, judie.
Your newest one.
Yes, it's just been published.
You can have that copy if you wish.
Oh, it's a first edition and you've signed it.
Yes, of course.
Thank you so much.
May I serve tea now, Ms. Van Gorder?
Yes, please do, Warner.
I see you've engaged new servants.
Yes, of course.
How did you persuade them to live in this house?
Jane Patterson, my new housekeeper, knows this house better than you do, doctor.
She worked for John Fleming.
And Warner was my chauffeur.
Chauffeur turned butler?
It's incredible.
He can play any part at a moment's notice.
Did you-- did you get a plumber, Warner?
Warner: No, we can't get a plumber for three days, madame.
What about that leaking pipe?
The basement will be flooded in three days.
The pipe is no longer leaking.
You mean it's dried up of its own accord?
Not quite, I packed the elbow where the water was coming up.
Packed the elbow?
Where did you learn how to do that?
Into each life, a little rain must fall.
And a careful man learns to keep himself dry.
Now, is there anything that you require, Miss Van Gorder?
No, not at the moment, Warner.
Thank you, madame.
Now, there's a character.
How long did you say that he worked for you as chauffeur?
About three months.
Dr. Wells: Well, I hope he doesn't have a police record.
My dear Dale, it may interest you to know that the last night of his life, John Fleming told me that he loved your husband like a son.
If Fleming were alive today, he would be fighting to prove Vick's innocence.
Could Mr. Fleming prove his own innocence?
Miss Van Gorder, can there be any doubt about it?
There will be when Ms. Holland testifies at Vick's trial.
Oh?
You know something that we haven't heard yet, judie?
Something I saw with my own eyes.
She's not permitted to say what it was.
My dear girl, I wouldn't think of asking her.
But let's assume for a moment that Fleming did steal the million.
Now, what would he do about it?
Where is it?
Hidden some place where he could lay his hands on it without getting caught in the act.
Now, if I was writing this instead of living in the middle of it, I'd hide it right here in this spooky old house.
Under a loose floorboard or up a chimney?
If Mr. Fleming had the nerve to steal a million, he'd make his plans well in advance.
I'd say he'd prepare a place to hide it, possibly when this house was being built.
I rented this place from mark Fleming, his nephew.
I wonder-- I wonder if he'd have the floor plans.
I'll ask him.
Yes.
Lizzie, will you bring
Mrs. Bailey the phone?
You ask him now.
His number is summit--
Summit-- 7537.
Thank you, Lizzie.
Summit?
Cordelia Van Gorder: 7537.
Not bad, hey, Andy?
That means new business.
Now, you see?
Somebody wants to buy a house.
Mark Fleming speaking.
Oh, hello, Dale.
Well, hang on a minute, honey, while I see if I have it.
It's Dale Bailey all excited.
Ms. Van Gorder wants to know if I have the floor plans of the Oaks.
Now, what would she want ith the floor plans?
Well, she suggested to me that your uncle might have hidden the bank loot there.
Are the plans here?
Somewhere in the house itself-- wait a minute.
There is a place where uncle Johnny might have kept those blueprints.
What place?
Well, I heard him talk about it a good many years ago.
I can't be sure of the exact location.
Anyway, I don't think the old boy had the guts to steal a million.
But if I find those plans,
I'll let you know, Andy.
Hello, Dale?
Look, honey, I haven't seen those plans since I was a kid.
But I'll come over tonight, and maybe we can find them.
Thank you, mark.
We'll expect you.
He seems to think they're here in the house somewhere.
He's coming over tonight.
Well, that's good.
Dale and judie are my house guests for the weekend.
Would you like to have dinner with us tonight?
Oh, no thank you, I couldn't.
I still have a few calls to make.
You know, if Judy's testimony is going to clear Vick Bailey and implicate John
Fleming, others may get the idea that there's buried treasure in this house.
Don't even mention your testimony until you're actually on the stand.
Oh, I won't.
That's a smart girl, judie, and a very lovely girl.
Well, good afternoon, ladies.
Doctor.
Goodbye, Dr. Wells.
Come on, girls, let's go.
Cordelia Van Gorder:
So many unusual things have happened here this summer.
The more I think about it, the more
I realize I should be putting them down on paper.
Weren't you your husband's secretary, Dale?
Yes, I was.
Do you take shorthand?
Mm-hm.
Well, my dear, if you'd like to have your mind occupied,
I want you to work with me while I write the story of this fantastic criminal, the Bat.
Wonderful dinner.
Thank you.
It was really nice.
It was a good dinner,
Lizzie, as usual.
Wonderful.
Oh, what a lovely piece of silver.
It's an original, isn't it?
Cordelia Van Gorder: Yes, the still use them in england.
That clock hasn't struck the hour in the last 10 years, if I'm to believe what mark Fleming told me.
Why is it angled away from the wall like that?
I don't know.
Somebody must have moved it.
Lizzie, very like, when she was dusting.
Wait a minute.
Did you know there's a door in this paneling?
No, I didn't.
Oh, by gracious!
So there is!
Maybe it opens to a secret passage.
Certainly to a secret something!
Who knows, girls, we may be about to stumble on that missing million.
There's a panel.
There must be some gimmick to it.
There always is.
Oh!
Officer: Calling car
11, calling car 11.
Proceed to the Oaks in
Zenith township immediately.
A homicide has been reported.
Ok.
Proceeding to the Oaks.
Notify the county coroner, Dr. Wells.
Tell him to come to the Oaks at once.
Horrible.
It's as if his throat had been torn by some creature with fans, or claws.
That's his sign.
We found it on the others he killed.
I had hoped those reports that he was up to his old tricks again were pure imagination.
But apparently they're based on fact.
He's come back, back to the scene of his kills.
Yes, that's who I mean.
That's who did this, the Bat.
Who found mark?
We all did.
That is Dale, and judie, and I,
Lizzie was in the dining room.
This is my new housekeeper,
Jane Patterson.
You know, she worked for John Fleming.
I know her.
Where were you, Mrs. Patterson?
In the kitchen cleaning up.
I cooked the dinner tonight.
Did you know that this secret closet was here?
No, it was behind the grandfather's clock.
Well, it was I who found it, really.
I noticed the clock had been moved.
And the door wasn't quite closed.
I'll get it.
Who is it?
Mark Fleming.
As coroner, you saw the same wounds on the others.
How long has he been dead?
Oh, I'd say about a half an hour.
Do you believe it was the Bat?
That's the Bat's trademark.
Perhaps he's still in the house.
It's possible.
Why should he be?
Because he's looking for something, and like you, he believes it's here.
And he's a persistent killer.
I would advise you get out of this house as quickly as possible, not withstanding our expert police protection.
Have you called the morgue?
They're on their way here.
Oh, good, I want to examine the body before they get here.
May we take it into another room?
Yes, to the sun room in the back.
Thank you, give me a hand.
Excuse me.
Oh, Warner, where have you been?
Well, madame it--
There's been an accident?
There's been a murder.
Mark Fleming, the young man from whom I leased this place, was killed here tonight.
They know who did it?
Well, they-- they believe it was the Bat.
I'm sorry I had to use the front door, Miss Van Gorder.
Bu I forgot my keys, and when
I rang the bell at the kitchen door, there was no response.
Oh, this is Warner, Lieutenant.
He's my butler.
He was my chauffeur.
Why'd you promote him?
Well, it's very difficult to find a butler.
They don't like service in the country.
Have you been a butler before?
I've served in many capacities, sir.
But this was my night off, and I forgot my keys.
I heard that part.
What time did you leave the house tonight?
Oh, about 6:30.
I had dinner at wiley's roadhouse.
Can you prove where you spent the rest of the evening?
I can try.
Try hard.
And don't leave the house.
I'll get to you later.
Very good, sir.
I shall be in my room, Miss
Van Gorder, if you need me.
Yes, Warner.
Surely, you don't think he's--
Warner and I have met before.
I can't recall where or when.
But I will.
There will be a crew here shortly from headquarters, dusting for fingerprints, taking photographs.
But in the meantime,
Mrs. Patterson, you aren't leaving the house tonight are you?
No, Lieutenant.
Don't, I'll talk to you in the morning.
Goodnight.
Goodnight, sir.
Goodnight.
Dale, I was with mark
Fleming this afternoon when you talked to him about the floor plans of this house.
I heard him tell you he was coming here tonight.
Dale called him at my request.
She told me he was coming.
Who else heard her tell you that?
Judie, Lizzie.
And that nice Dr. Wells.
Dr. Wells?
There are few killers who kill for the fun of it.
The Bat very likely is a mental case.
And I'm convinced that his crimes are by his person gain.
There's a million dollars at large.
And he's going to keep on hunting for it until he lays his hands on it.
Now, these young ladies are staying here tonight?
Yes, they're my house guests.
Well, when my crew arrives, we'll be busy for a while.
So I'd suggest that--
That we go to our rooms?
That's a very good idea.
Come on, girls.
What a police guard for this house tonight, Lieutenant?
You've got one.
I'm going to cover this place tonight from the attic to the basement.
If the Bat makes another call, I'll have a little surprise for him.
Who, uh-- who is he?
Have you any idea?
He could be anybody.
So far, there are clues to his identity, but nothing we could take before a jury.
I am afraid we must look higher than the criminal world.
He may be a merchant, lawyer, doctor, scientist, one of the pillars of his community.
Ladies, lock your doors tonight.
Stay behind them.
I promise you you'll be safe.
Goodnight.
Goodnight, Lieutenant.
Poor mark.
Yeah, it's a pity.
So young.
Well, doctor, do you agree it was the Bat?
In my report, I shall say the death was caused by the same technique used in the other killings, a paralyzing blow to the throat, followed by a severe lacerations of the jugular, resulting in excessive hemorrhage.
In a layman's language, he didn't know what hit him.
Oh, he knew, but he didn't have time to think about it.
You staying here tonight, Andy?
Well, until I check the doors and windows.
But I'll be back bright and early in the morning.
Neither snow, nor rain, nor heat, nor gloom of night stays these couriers from the swift completion of their appointed rounds.
A lot of people are due for a shock when I close this case.
Yes, I'm sure they are.
Goodnight, Andy, don't get hurt.
Goodnight, doctor.
You know, I think we'd better let get some sleep.
Oh, well Lizzie and
I share this room for mutual protection.
You know, one night, a storm blew the wires down, put the lights out.
And I went out the next day and bought a half a dozen of these things.
You better take one with you, Dale.
Oh, thank you.
We'll go across the hall.
Are you sure there's nothing else you need?
Quite sure, we'll be all right.
Well, if anything bothers you, you just sing out.
And two strong women will come to your rescue.
Oh, nothing will bother us, not with Andy on the job.
Goodnight.
Goodnight.
Don't worry, everything will be all right.
Goodnight.
Goodnight.
Come on, Lizzie.
I don't think
I'll sleep tonight.
Me neither.
All I can see is poor mark Fleming staring at us.
I thought that when people died their eyes closed, as in sleep.
Don't think about it.
I bet you're thinking about it.
No, I was thinking of my poor husband sleeping in jail tonight.
Oh, judie, I love him so much.
What's that noise?
Oh, I don't know.
I kind of fell half asleep.
For a moment, I thought it was something from a dream.
It's somewhere in the house.
Yes, on the floor above, not directly over us, probably a room overlooking the driveway.
Should we call Ms. Van Gorder?
She'll hear it.
How can she help but hear it?
Besides, we don't want her to think we're a couple of hysterical women.
I'm about to become one.
I've had it for one night.
Dale, you're not going out in that hall.
I want to know what's happening up there.
But Lieutenant
Anderson said if we stayed behind our locked doors, we'd be safe.
Vick isn't safe locked up in that jail.
Suppose that stolen money is in this house.
Mark Fleming seemed to think it was.
Maybe that's what somebody's looking for.
Oh, for heaven's sake, don't you hear that awful noise up there?
Now, Lizzie!
You've just got to stay awake!
The house phone and the outside phone wires have been cut!
And we can't get help!
Where's that policeman?
Oh, I don't know.
Something must have happened to him.
Now, go on.
Get on your robe.
Oh, Dale, please don't go up there.
I've got to.
Think what it could mean to Vick.
Now you stay here.
Oh no, if you go, I go.
You stay here.
No, no--
You wait here.
I'm going to see what it is.
Oh, please let me go with you.
Judie, will you warn me if anyone comes?
And I'll only be a moment.
Now, wait.
Oh no!
What did he do to her!
Judie!
No, not judie!
Give her to me.
I'll look after her.
Poor baby.
Judie.
The Bat.
Yes, the Bat.
He caught her at the head of the stairs.
We saw him rushing down the stairs as we came out of the room.
I hurled that after him.
I hit him, I believe.
I'm going to cover this place from attic to basement, you said!
Well, what were you covering when that poor child was murdered?
Where were you?
I saw a man outside on the grounds.
I went out there and hunted him.
I heard him in among the trees.
And so I followed the sound of him as far as the brook down near the back road.
And then I lost him.
Oh.
I'd rather give my own life than have this happen to Judy.
But I told you to stay in your rooms and lock your doors and stay there!
What was she doing at the head of those stairs?
That was my fault.
They heard a strange noise, heavy pounding in one of the rooms on the third floor.
We all heard it.
I wanted to see what it was.
Judie, she wouldn't let me go out by myself.
I made her stay on the balcony.
What about your new butler?
Well, he's in his room, I suppose.
Oh, Mrs. Patterson.
Yes?
Did you know what happened here?
No, sir, but I heard the screams.
I to call Warner.
We have rooms on the same floor.
But he wasn't in his room.
His bed hasn't been slept in.
If Mrs. Patterson heard the screams,
Warner could certainly hear them.
You're quite right, sir.
I heard them.
Oh, you did?
And where were you?
Outside on the grounds.
Ms. Holland has been murdered.
No.
So you're surprised, shocked.
Well, I've seen better performances.
I remember you now.
Your name's not Warner.
I've got a circular in my office with your picture on it.
The Chicago police not so long ago were hunting for you in connection with a robbery.
You're right again, sir.
And they found me, and they tried me.
And I proved my innocence.
And I was acquitted.
That could have been a lucky break.
Where were you when this child was killed?
I told you before, sir, outside.
What were you doing there?
I was following you.
I saw you leaving the house.
And it seemed that you were hunting someone.
I thought you might need some help.
Oh, yes, sir, I followed your flashlight down through the trees.
Then it disappeared.
And then suddenly as I was staring out into the darkness,
I was struck by something on to the back of the head.
Next thing I knew, I was lying on the ground.
I realized I'd been knocked out.
I wish you had been knocked out.
For then we'd have found you with your mask still on your face!
You were hit here in this house with this poker as you were rushing down those stairs after that child--
Oh, no, sir, you can't pin this on me.
I'm not the Bat!
I've never killed.
I couldn't kill.
I won't take the rap for this!
Well, doctor, we have another case for the county coroner.
You see, the Bat came back.
Why did you come back, doctor?
Well, I-- I had an accident about a mile down the road.
The right rear wheel of my car came off, and I plunged into the ditch.
This was the nearest house.
So I came here to call for help.
I thought I'd find you around, Andy.
Physician, heal thyself.
You're must have been hit by something on the back of your head.
I told you.
I had an accident.
So you did, doctor.
So you did.
I could be wrong.
But maybe I'm not.
We shall see.
Fine, dear, let's start a new chapter.
For days, the murders held the headlines.
Lieutenant Anderson grilled us, and ransacked the house from top to bottom.
Warner was not placed under arrest.
But his every move was watched.
At night, except for a detective on guard in the house, the police and the reporters left us alone.
And on one of those nights, without telling
Lizzie or anyone else, I pursued a secret investigation of my own.
It was in an empty room on the third floor where we kept our trunks and other things.
Put 'em up, Bat.
That's a bright idea to kill me in my own lab and let people think that I'm the Bat.
But you had to kill me first.
What was it to be, ambush?
Clever as you are, you're not smart enough to do that.
Nor were you smart enough to find the money, though you came quite close to it.
But I know where it is.
And when you're dead with that sign pinned on your chest,
I'm going to collect it and live happily ever after.
He destroyed himself, how true that will be.
Goodbye, Bat.
Here's a serum that will heal you whether you're rabid or not.
Something's wrong.
Something's wrong.
Miss Cornelia?
Miss Cornelia?
Now, where would she be going at this time of night?
I never!
Oh!
Mr. Davenport, Mr. Davenport--
Oh, a fine thing, the door unbolted, the chain off, and you asleep on the job.
Wait till Lieutenant
Anderson hears about this.
Come on!
Wake up!
What's the matter with you?
I don't know.
I don't know.
My head hurts, my whole body is numb.
Here, here, take a sip of this.
Try to snap out of it.
I'll be back in a minute.
Hurry, will you?
It's Lizzie.
I'm terribly worried.
I can't find Ms.
Cornelia anywhere.
And something's happened to the policeman.
I don't know what.
Get Warner.
Bring him to the drawing room.
Tell him we need him.
Are you all right now?
Yeah, I'll be all right in a minute.
I remember now.
I took a drink of wine from that decanter there.
Ms. Van Gorder told me to help myself.
She wouldn't put nothing in it.
Well, somebody did, somebody who knew I was on duty here.
And it was somebody that got Ms. Van Gorder.
I can't find her anywhere-- upstairs, downstairs, or in the basement.
I told the housekeeper to get Warner.
Lieutenant Anderson will want to know about this.
Hello?
Yeah, this is
Davenport at the Oaks.
We've got trouble here.
Well, for one thing
I was drugged.
Yeah.
But I must have been knocked out, because the maid tells me
Ms. Van Gorder's missing.
You better call Anderson and let him know.
He's not at home?
Well where is he?
Out on a case?
What case?
Dr. Wells?
What else did they tell you about him?
Oh, hurry, will you?
We've got to find Ms. Cornelia!
Ok.
Lieutenant Anderson is out on a case.
Dr. Wells was found dead in a room next to his garage, murdered.
Dr. Wells?
There's something queer about the killing of Wells.
But headquarters won't talk about it.
Lizzie, Warner isn't in his room.
There's no sign of him anywhere.
And I was supposed to keep an eye on that guy.
Where's Ms. Cornelia?
That's what I want to know!
Wait a minute!
Didn't you say that the chain and the bolt were off of the front door?
I certainly did.
Well, maybe Ms. Van
Gorder went outside.
Oh, she never would.
We better look.
I can't-- I can't breathe.
There's no air.
Ms. Cornelia?
Ms. Van Gorder?
Ms. Van Gorder?
Look!
There's a light in that room on the third floor.
Were you up there tonight?
Well, of course I was, but I turned the lights out before I came downstairs.
Ms. Cornelia might have turned them on again.
That's where we're going to look first.
Come on!
Cornelia?
Miss Cornelia?
Miss Cornelia?
Yes!
I'm here!
Right here!
Here we are, Ms. Van Gorder.
What do we do now?
Over the mantle, there are five panels.
Try to-- with your hands.
Which panel did you say, Ms. Van Gorder?
Oh, I-- I just--
Ms. Van Gorder!
Which panel!
We couldn't hear you!
She said strike it!
What difference does it make which panel?
Strike them all!
Look!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh, it's all right now.
It's all right, dear.
Lizzie's here.
I'm feeling better?
Yes, much better.
We'll take you to your room.
Oh, no you want.
I'm going to stay right here.
I'm quite all right.
Oh, how blessed it is to breathe without an effort.
You know, no one knows how sweet the air can taste until someone shuts it off for a moment.
That room is just like a box.
When the mantle piece closed, it seemed like all the air was drawn out of it.
Look!
There it goes again!
Let it close.
I can open it from in here.
There's a control panel behind this blueprint, electric motor under the trap door here.
Once the door's open, you can keep it that way.
I believe that the fireplace in this other room opens the same way.
And it does.
I tried to find this.
But I couldn't find it.
Yeah, it was back of this blueprint here.
Well, it's-- it's quite a set up.
Too bad we can't open that safe the same way.
Take an expert to crack this box, or a shot of nitro.
Maybe-- maybe that's what the Bat had in mind.
Could be, seems he's on the prowl tonight.
Ms. Van Gorder,
Warner has disappeared.
Really?
And Dr. Wells has been murdered.
Dr. Wells?
Lieutenant Anderson's on that case right now.
Well, does he know what happened here tonight?
They got word to him.
He'll be here any minute.
What's that noise?
Ms. Van Gorder, the garage is on fire.
Great scot!
Look at that!
Lizzie, put that light out in the other room.
Now, where are you going?
To report the fire.
Well, you just stay right here.
But Ms. Van Gorder, the garage.
Let it burn.
You watch the stairs.
Can't you see that fire was set to get us out of the house.
Out of the-- well, you're talking about the--
Yes, yes, I'm talking about the Bat.
Now that the lights are out, he'll think his trick has worked, and we've gone.
He'll be here any minute.
Well, so will
Lieutenant Anderson.
I hope so.
But the Bat will be here first.
And he'll kill again if we're in his way.
We've got to be as clever as he is.
But you'll be safer downstairs.
I'll take care of him.
Well, the others can go.
But I'm going to stay right here.
All right, but get out of sight.
Let's face it, ladies, and get it over with.
Others have seen my face before they died.
But I'll have to deny you that pleasure.
This would make a good scene for your book, Ms. Van Gorder.
But I'm afraid you'll never write it.
That is Warner.
I could tell.
You misjudge me, Ms. Ellen.
Warner!
I don't like being a murder suspect, Ms. Van Gorder.
I was headed for a plane.
But halfway to the airport, I changed my mind and came back.
I'm glad that I did.
Why, it's Lieutenant Anderson!
Yes, it was Anderson.
He had discovered the secret of the hidden room and was waiting to get into it and open up the safe.
We found the money in it, little over a million in tens, and twenties, and hundreds.
Good old Andy, with all his ill-gotten gains invested in bank stock.
It's rather a clever way to hide stolen money-- in the open, as it were, and so respectable.
But don't try it.
No matter how clever you are, you can't hide murder.
Well, that's it, Dale.
That's the end.
{27}{109}{y:i}After all, we hadn't seen|{y:i}each other since cocktails,
{112}{189}{y:i}and we hadn't eaten together since lunch.
{192}{274}{y:i}Lulu was trying to work up|{y:i}interest in a word game.
{277}{341}{y:i}It's not easy with people|{y:i}who know just enough words
{344}{398}{y:i}to tell room service what they want.
{401}{459}It's really very simple, Your Highness.
{462}{523}You write the long word|on top of the page,
{526}{649}and under it, you write all of the short|words you can make out of the long one.
{652}{676}Oh.
{679}{742}For the long word, let's use "vicissitudes".
{745}{793}Is that actually a word?
{796}{862}V-i-c-i-s-s-i-t-u-d-e-s.
{865}{956}It's changes, fluctuations,|like the vicissitudes of life.
{959}{1008}How clever of you, my dear.
{1011}{1118}{y:i}- J'ai besoin de champagne.|- Did you say something, Your Majesty?
{1121}{1231}- I shall require more champagne.|"- Mais certainement." Oscar.
{1455}{1508}- More of the same for the king.|- Yes, sir.
{1511}{1626}- What news from the gaming table?|- Good. Alberto is having a fantastic bank.
{1629}{1734}It's about time. Last night that Greek took|him for a whole South American jungle.
{1737}{1825}You know, off the screen, I don't think|I've seen you laugh before.
{1828}{1902}- I feel good tonight.|- Every night's like every other night.
{1905}{1964}- No, not tonight.|- What's different?
{1967}{2053}I don't know. Something|in the way my heart beats.
{2056}{2146}As if something very good|were going to come out of tonight.
{2233}{2312}Something's coming, all right,|but it's not good. He's mad.
{2315}{2428}I've seen him like this before.|He's half-crazy when he gets like this.
{2706}{2771}How do I find the words|to tell you what you are?
{2786}{2876}To begin with, a thief. You took|money from me when I was playing.
{2879}{2935}When I was winning. It changed my luck.
{2938}{2996}You have cost me millions of francs.
{3004}{3061}You put a curse on me,|not only for tonight,
{3064}{3129}but from the unhappy moment|I knew of your existence.
{3132}{3198}As you will put a curse always|on everyone near to you.
{3204}{3278}- Maybe you can talk this over in private.|- Let him, Oscar.
{3281}{3401}Next, you are not a woman. I do not know|what you are, but you are not a woman.
{3419}{3488}You will not let yourself|be loved. You cannot love.
{3491}{3559}Once, you had the look|for me of an exquisite lady.
{3562}{3673}Now I do not see that look. I only see|that you have the body of an animal.
{3676}{3725}A dead animal.
{3756}{3845}I have paid for your company and|you will come and go as I tell you.
{3848}{3897}Monsieur. Permit me.
{4247}{4322}- Is the gigolo known to anyone?|- He is known to me.
{4344}{4419}His name is Vincenzo,|Conte Torlato-Favrini.
{4422}{4543}He is not a gigolo. He is less a gigolo|than anyone in our immediate company.
{4547}{4648}Surely less than anyone you will|ever have the good fortune to meet.
{4651}{4739}He certainly acts high and mighty|for just a count.
{4742}{4887}My dear Lulu, there are counts and|counts, just as there are kings and kings.
{4899}{4974}Among the counts,|Torlato-Favrini is a king.
{4977}{5067}Just as among the kings, I am a clown.
{5097}{5219}I am puzzled only by his presence|in a place like this, among people like us.
{5301}{5368}My champagne is not properly cooled.
{5407}{5496}Alberto, do you happen to know|the Marquise de Baudenière?
{5499}{5555}A really distinguished family...
{5558}{5662}{y:i} And that was the last|{y:i}I ever saw of Maria Vargas,
{5665}{5728}{y:i}whom the world knew as Maria D'Amata,
{5773}{5885}{y:i}but who died as|{y:i}the Contessa Torlato-Favrini.
{6154}{6241}{y:i} Che sarà, sarà.|{y:i}What will be, will be.
{6270}{6350}{y:i}An ancient and unimaginative|{y:i}Italian proverb.
{6370}{6484}{y:i}It has been the motto of my house|{y:i}for more than 450 years.
{6509}{6634}{y:i}And it is only fitting perhaps that, as the|{y:i}House of Torlato-Favrini comes to its end,
{6637}{6714}{y:i}our motto will never be more to the point.
{6717}{6771}{y:i}What will be, will be.
{6855}{6936}{y:i}An easy generality. A universal cure.
{6960}{7046}{y:i}I am what I am, do what I do,|{y:i}and cannot help myself.
{7049}{7111}{y:i}Therefore, I am free of my guilt.
{7114}{7163}{y:i}Nonsense, of course.
{7220}{7337}{y:i}Yet, I can suggest no other answer,|{y:i}if there must be an answer,
{7340}{7439}{y:i}to how and why it began|{y:i}between Maria and me.
{7619}{7750}{y:i}I was driving, as I had for|{y:i}countless times before that time.
{7753}{7832}{y:i}I was driving somewhere, anywhere,
{7843}{7969}{y:i}just to be away from the restlessness|{y:i}of nights after nights without sleep
{7972}{8034}{y:i}and the empty dawns that followed them.
{8086}{8193}{y:i}But why, of all the somewheres|{y:i}and anywheres in the world,
{8196}{8304}{y:i}should I, that time, have crossed|{y:i}the border from Italy to France?
{8316}{8391}{y:i}Of all directions, why|{y:i}should I have chosen one
{8394}{8519}{y:i}leading to that parade ground of vulgarity|{y:i}which lies between Nice and Cannes?
{8558}{8607}{y:i}Che sarà, sarà.
{9771}{9820}{y:i}
{12116}{12202}{y:i}She looked at me for no longer|{y:i}than the beat of a heart,
{12205}{12292}{y:i}and I knew I would remember her|{y:i}as long as I lived.
{12381}{12439}{y:i}That was my meeting with Maria.
{12442}{12554}{y:i}It occurs to me just now that, oddly,|{y:i}we have never talked about it.
{12577}{12695}{y:i}But no more odd, surely,|{y:i}than my driving away that day,
{12698}{12836}{y:i}away from her, knowing that,|{y:i}inevitably, we would meet again.
{13194}{13314}{y:i}And it was late that night|{y:i}in, of all places, a gambling casino
{13317}{13366}{y:i}when I saw Maria again.
{16561}{16646}To begin with, a thief. You took|money from me when I was playing.
{16649}{16712}When I was winning. It changed my luck.
{16715}{16773}You have cost me millions of francs.
{16776}{16829}You put a curse on me,|not only for tonight,
{16832}{16895}but from the unhappy moment|I knew you existed.
{16898}{16965}As you will put a curse always|on everyone near to you.
{16968}{17049}- Maybe you can talk this over in private.|- Let him, Oscar.
{17052}{17163}Next, you are not a woman. I do not know|what you are, but you are not a woman.
{17166}{17229}You will not let yourself|be loved. You cannot love.
{17232}{17295}Once, you had the look|for me of an exquisite lady.
{17298}{17405}Now I do not see that look. I see only|that you have the body of an animal.
{17424}{17469}A dead animal.
{17472}{17550}I have paid for your company|and you will come and go as I tell you.
{17553}{17602}Monsieur. Permit me.
{17764}{17842}{y:i} I cannot remember much|{y:i}of that shabby little scene,
{17845}{17915}{y:i}except for some cheap|{y:i}heroics on my part.
{17934}{18043}{y:i}But I do remember that Maria seemed|{y:i}unsurprised at my being there.
{18054}{18120}{y:i}That she left with me without question.
{18146}{18205}{y:i}As if she had been waiting for me.
{18995}{19047}Thank you. I do not smoke.
{19050}{19099}What is your name?
{19151}{19188}Maria Vargas.
{19191}{19244}Are you Spanish?
{19247}{19306}But I live in America. I work there.
{19313}{19410}What is your work? Are you|a professional entertainer?
{19413}{19481}In a way. Perhaps not|in the way that you think.
{19509}{19571}You have no way of knowing|the way that I think.
{19574}{19676}- Where are we going?|- First, to your hotel, so that you can pack.
{19679}{19756}- And then?|- To Rapallo. Do you know where it is?
{19759}{19800}In Italy.
{19803}{19862}- Why to Rapallo?|- I live there.
{19896}{19960}And did you drive here|today from Rapallo?
{19963}{20007}- Mm-hm.|- Why?
{20010}{20068}To bring you back with me.
{20071}{20120}Oh, I think not.
{20175}{20248}My name is Vincenzo Torlato-Favrini.
{20251}{20343}And what are you doing here...|besides having come for me?
{20359}{20423}There is no other reason.
{20426}{20484}Tell me, do you see many movies?
{20493}{20603}Oh, very few. A good foreign film|now and then - American or English.
{20606}{20658}Then perhaps you read|many cheap novels?
{20691}{20724}I understand.
{20727}{20837}You would be justified in asking also|whether I am addicted to narcotics.
{20840}{20906}I have told you the complete truth.
{20923}{21009}- You have never seen me before today?|- Never.
{21029}{21096}- But you have known about me?|- No.
{21141}{21192}Then you left Rapallo to find
{21195}{21268}and to bring back someone|you had never seen or heard about?
{21271}{21366}No. I left my home simply|because I had to leave.
{21379}{21495}It has happened many times before.|There is, perhaps, an explanation for it.
{21507}{21566}But I will not attempt one here and now.
{21599}{21651}When did you know|that you had come for me?
{21660}{21721}When you knew, too.
{21758}{21847}For the first time, when we looked|at each other in the Gypsy camp,
{21859}{21914}and again at the window of the casino,
{21925}{22021}and again, just now, when|I held out my hand to you.
{22089}{22155}You knew, as well as I.
{22288}{22347}It won't take me long to pack.
{23724}{23816}Torlatos, Favrinis, and Torlato-Favrinis.
{23819}{23930}When my sister and I are extinct, perhaps|they will name automobiles after us.
{23933}{24010}The Torlatos and the Favrinis|will be speedy little cars,
{24013}{24088}and the Torlato-Favrini|a limousine, of course.
{24119}{24193}This was Beatrice Favrini.
{24235}{24330}How strange, to be painted|with a little boy and a sword.
{24333}{24426}The little boy was her son.|The sword was her husband's.
{24429}{24560}It was brought to her when he was killed|in a stupid war between Italian cities.
{24563}{24633}My own husband|was killed in this last war.
{24636}{24703}I have neither his child nor his sword.
{24722}{24789}He was blown up at sea.|I do not have even his cadaver.
{24792}{24837}Eleonora...
{24840}{24947}But perhaps you should tell the story,|Vincenzo, of a "happy" ancestor.
{24953}{25040}- Francesco the Fat, for instance.|- Francesco can wait.
{25062}{25136}I have the honour to present|Benvenuto Torlato.
{25162}{25268}- You have a resemblance to him.|- Thank you. I'm proud of the coincidence.
{25271}{25390}I admire this gentleman. He was one of|Cesare Borgia's most trusted assassins.
{25393}{25453}He was stabbed to death|and thrown into the Arno.
{25456}{25542}- Then what do you admire about him?|- His foresight.
{25545}{25622}He adopted the motto|of our house. "Che sarà, sarà."
{25644}{25702}He knew what it would be like with us.
{26930}{26979}{y:i}
{27087}{27186}It has occurred to you, of course,|that I intend to marry Maria?
{27189}{27261}- It has occurred to me.|- Do you approve?
{27294}{27352}- Have you told her?|- Not yet.
{27378}{27433}She has been waiting to be told.
{27436}{27527}I believe the proper word|in connection with marriage is "ask".
{27530}{27573}You keep saying "told".
{27576}{27683}I know Maria very little, but I've known|for weeks that she is in love with you.
{27686}{27731}Do you approve?
{27734}{27820}It is almost frightening,|how much in love with you she is.
{27835}{27885}Then you don't approve.
{27888}{27937}Why do you ask me at all?
{27953}{28018}Because you want me|to tell you what you already know?
{28021}{28132}That to marry Maria would be the most|destructive thing you'll ever have done?
{28140}{28225}As for destruction, we have|already been destroyed, you and I.
{28228}{28285}We have come to the end of our line.
{28300}{28351}Literally, to the end of the line.
{28367}{28445}It is time for the Torlato-Favrinis|to get off the world.
{28453}{28544}The fact remains that we are neither|unique nor important to the world,
{28547}{28603}and it will go on without us.
{28615}{28676}How will we be remembered, I wonder?
{28684}{28741}Why should we be remembered at all?
{28749}{28880}Nobility - the kind that continues|just because it continues to exist -
{28883}{28927}is becoming extinct.
{28930}{28974}But why?
{28977}{29053}Because the world has|become a changed place.
{29056}{29137}And, like the dinosaurs,|we can no longer function in it.
{29157}{29248}Perhaps that's why|I'm incapable of having a child.
{29294}{29360}- Perhaps that's why you...|- We cannot have come this far
{29363}{29487}to leave nothing behind but some|undistinguished, unidentifiable portraits,
{29490}{29617}to be hung on the back walls of curiosity|shops to gather the dust of the future.
{29643}{29692}Come here, Eleonora.
{30016}{30065}The last contessa.
{30217}{30348}The world will some day see|paintings of her, and of her and me,
{30351}{30487}and then it will think: "What a pity|they have gone and left nothing behind."
{30509}{30551}We will be remembered.
{30554}{30616}Because the last contessa|was a movie star?
{30619}{30688}You cannot marry a woman|as if you were putting on a play,
{30691}{30781}because she's the type you've in mind,|because she's perfectly cast
{30784}{30862}as a portrait of the last|Contessa Torlato-Favrini.
{30916}{30993}Maria is a living woman,|too much in love with you.
{30996}{31055}Have you thought|for a moment about her?
{31058}{31124}Have you thought about|anybody else but yourself
{31127}{31245}and your obsession with 14 letters of the|alphabet arranged in a hyphenated name?
{31248}{31358}Thought about anybody else?|Yes. Yes, Eleonora, I have.
{31371}{31442}About everybody else, it seems to me.
{31445}{31563}I have thought about every individual|living man, woman and child in the world,
{31566}{31613}it seems to me.
{31616}{31674}I've had the time for it, you know?
{31677}{31787}Since the 25th October 1942, to be exact.
{31799}{31848}It's a lot of time.
{31881}{31966}Especially when it|stands still with loneliness.
{31969}{32029}Especially when it has|no days and nights,
{32032}{32134}but just days that turn black|when the sun sets.
{32137}{32186}It's a lot of time.
{32199}{32252}Especially when there|is nothing to think of
{32255}{32340}but all the living men,|women and children in the world.
{32343}{32423}And nothing to do|but to think about them.
{32426}{32515}And no way to forget|that I am none of them.
{32588}{32715}Perhaps I have become, as you put it,|obsessed by our name and our past,
{32728}{32825}and the absence of our future,|and by our paintings.
{32838}{32881}As if, in some magical way,
{32884}{33002}our long line of paintings will|accomplish what we cannot.
{33031}{33089}I hadn't wanted this.
{33092}{33207}It has happened to me without|my wanting, almost without my knowing.
{33210}{33282}You are quite right, and|I do not have the right.
{33316}{33365}But I do love Maria.
{33419}{33495}{y:i} The bride on whom|{y:i}the rain doth fall.
{33498}{33613}{y:i}I read the announcement in the ship's|{y:i}newspaper, about six months ago.
{33616}{33724}{y:i}That Maria D'Amata was going to|{y:i}marry Count Torlato-Favrini.
{33727}{33781}{y:i}The gossip columns|{y:i}had been full of rumours.
{33784}{33922}{y:i}Mostly the kind of angry insinuations they|{y:i}write when nobody's really got the story.
{33925}{34011}{y:i}They even got on me, figuring|{y:i}I knew more than I was telling.
{34014}{34096}{y:i}They were right. I'd had|{y:i}many letters from Maria.
{34116}{34198}{y:i}What I knew was that the prince|{y:i}had finally caught up with Cinderella
{34201}{34323}{y:i}and that nothing remained but the slipper|{y:i}business and a happy life ever after.
{34361}{34486}{y:i}Maria was trousseau-shopping in Rome|{y:i}when I got here. So I went to work.
{34595}{34644}{y:i}
{34712}{34761}Maria!
{34921}{34959}- Eddie?|- Yeah, boss?
{34962}{35081}You and Jack keep lookin' for that|alley. I'll see you back at the hotel.
{35155}{35208}- Well.|- Well.
{35225}{35303}- How's Jerry?|- Jerry's fine. Sends her love.
{35306}{35359}- You look fine.|- I feel fine.
{35386}{35435}Well?
{35444}{35497}Well.
{35519}{35587}I'm behaving like... like 13 years old.
{35590}{35675}Don't kid yourself.|You look 14 if you look a day.
{35717}{35766}Where do you want to begin?
{35785}{35843}There was no beginning.
{35846}{35983}As if all my life I had lived in a dark place,|and all at once the lights went on.
{35986}{36048}That's the way it happens in fairy tales.
{36060}{36134}Are you still bewitched? And bewildered?
{36137}{36284}No. Never in my life have I been more|sure of myself, and of everything else.
{36300}{36378}- Tell me about him.|- How can I? What would I tell you?
{36381}{36517}That he is handsome and tall, and|good and kind, and proud and so on?
{36520}{36620}This is how the hero is described in the|magazines one reads at the hairdresser.
{36623}{36713}Then what is "he" that the hero is not?
{36749}{36817}This is what I do not know how to tell you.
{36820}{36869}For instance?
{36884}{36947}I say I cannot tell you|and you say "Tell it."
{36950}{37030}Harry the director: I say I cannot|play a scene and you say "Play it."
{37033}{37101}And you do. So, for instance?
{37139}{37190}It would sound silly even to try,
{37193}{37246}but perhaps not to you.
{37264}{37305}Harry, you won't laugh,
{37308}{37409}but it is really like in the story|of "la Cenicienta" and the prince.
{37412}{37454}- What is?|- Everything.
{37457}{37508}Even when we're alone together.
{37511}{37592}- How do you mean that?|- And now you will laugh.
{37605}{37684}- He kisses my hand.|- That figures. Standard opening.
{37691}{37790}- Now you are being deliberately stupid.|- No, I'm...
{37793}{37873}Oh! So he kisses your hand, period.
{37886}{37989}- Is that all right with you?|- No, of course... Yes.
{37992}{38080}- As it should be with a contessa.|- In a fairy tale.
{38083}{38154}How long's it been|since you've known him?
{38157}{38206}Almost six weeks.
{38239}{38336}Six weeks of being|near you day and night.
{38339}{38451}Sometimes he holds me with his two|hands, like this, and just looks at me.
{38454}{38497}Are you sure he can see you?
{38500}{38596}He sees more than any man I have|ever known. Except perhaps you.
{38604}{38730}- I'm not seeing much of anything for now.|- I told you. He is what other men are not.
{38733}{38802}That seems obvious.|It also seems obvious that maybe
{38805}{38935}we're carrying this fairy-tale nonsense|a little too far - right smack into reality.
{38938}{38988}I don't want this to be a shock to you,
{38991}{39077}but a count is a man|and a contessa is a woman.
{39149}{39238}- You had better see for yourself.|- No, I want to hear more about this.
{39241}{39290}No. I have a sitting and I'm late.
{39416}{39550}{y:i} Looking back, I probably wasn't|{y:i}as worried then as I now think I was.
{39571}{39658}{y:i}But I do know that I was filled|{y:i}with a sudden uneasiness.
{39824}{39868}{y:i}
{39871}{39941}{y:i}|Signor Trilli, Signor Dawes.
{39944}{39993}Good afternoon.
{40040}{40090}Well, Harry? Say something.
{40093}{40156}Wait till they hear about this in California.
{40166}{40261}In six months, Beverly Hills will have|more statues than orange trees.
{40264}{40320}- Where does it go?|- Right where it is.
{40323}{40420}Although, due to a whim of Maria,|it will be more at home in our garden.
{40423}{40513}As you can see, she has insisted|upon posing with bare feet.
{40516}{40565}{y:i}
{40598}{40658}Have I failed to understand|something amusing?
{40661}{40749}It's a private joke. A stupid one|that can't be explained and make sense.
{40752}{40800}{y:i}
{40814}{40917}Signor Trilli would appreciate having|Maria to himself, without distractions.
{40920}{41050}I know exactly how he feels. The hardest|thing is getting an actor to stand still.
{41148}{41231}Won't you change your mind|and stay for dinner, Mr Dawes?
{41234}{41346}No, I can't. We're off location-hunting|in the morning and have work tonight.
{41349}{41439}- I'm overdue right now.|- Maria seems so happy to have you here.
{41442}{41498}I hope you won't return|to America too soon.
{41501}{41584}- It'll be quite a while.|- We will see you before then, I am sure.
{41587}{41654}But I know that Maria will|want you to be at our wedding.
{41657}{41748}Oh, haven't you heard?|I'm giving the bride away.
{41852}{41901}{y:i}
{41954}{42003}{y:i} And I did give her away.
{42039}{42137}{y:i}In an ancient chapel, witnessed|{y:i}by a handful of strangers,
{42140}{42281}{y:i}I gave the hand of Maria Vargas into|{y:i}that of Vincenzo, Count Torlato-Favrini.
{42930}{43002}{y:i}The servants had their own party,|{y:i}after the wedding.
{43005}{43083}{y:i}Nobody can tell me it was like that|{y:i}when the Borgias got married -
{43095}{43176}{y:i}more going on outside|{y:i}the palazzo than inside.
{43179}{43228}{y:i}Anyway, there were two receptions.
{43231}{43282}{y:i}And, knowing the bride as I did,
{43285}{43380}{y:i}I could tell she felt she'd come|{y:i}to the wrong reception.
{43398}{43447}{y:i}
{43594}{43685}The accordion player is the gardener's|son. The guitar is the gardener.
{43688}{43808}- I do not know who plays the violin.|- Paganini. He's the pastry cook.
{43811}{43864}They must have more guests|than we have.
{43867}{43943}That's as it should be.|Aristocracy only started to collapse
{43946}{44005}when there were|more aristocrats than servants.
{44008}{44078}- And they're having more fun.|- That they are.
{44149}{44192}On my wedding night,
{44195}{44263}I thought you would be happier|for me than you seem to be.
{44266}{44342}Are you happy? Well, then I'm happy.
{44345}{44437}It's just different from what I'd pictured.|I had something corny in mind.
{44440}{44548}Like dancing at your wedding.|Real bashful-boy stuff.
{44551}{44649}Then come dance with me, out there.|We belong out there anyway.
{44652}{44759}Maybe I do. But not you.|Not any more, contessa.
{44826}{44906}Vincenzo, would you object to|dancing with me out there?
{44909}{44966}I would not object to anything|you wanted to do,
{44969}{45027}but I don't think you'd|want to spoil their fun.
{45030}{45097}But it is our wedding.|Don't they expect us?
{45100}{45169}I imagine they are afraid|we might turn up.
{45172}{45226}It's hard to believe, in this day and age.
{45229}{45289}What makes you think|we live in this day and age?
{45292}{45391}The time has come. Bedtime for|children under 12 and movie directors.
{45394}{45418}I'll see you out.
{45421}{45515}In case I wasn't heard above the hubbub,|once more, I congratulate you.
{45518}{45567}- And me.|- And you.
{45629}{45738}Oh, uh... I've got to say something.|I hope you won't mind.
{45741}{45854}- I won't know until after you've said it.|- My relationship with Maria...
{45857}{45937}It's been a strange one.|I've never known what it was, really.
{45940}{46036}Friend, director, confessor,|part-time amateur psychiatrist.
{46045}{46150}- And, as of now, father of the bride?|- As of now, more like a godfather.
{46153}{46218}A fairy godfather, with a sense of reality.
{46225}{46280}No one could wish for anything more.
{46283}{46355}She's lived her whole life|as a fairy tale, you know?
{46358}{46412}No, I did not know.
{46419}{46485}She's never been in love before.|Take my word for it.
{46488}{46561}She's vulnerable.|Wide open to be hurt badly.
{46564}{46623}Emotionally, she's a child.
{46626}{46749}And she's wrapped all her dreams up|in one dream prince, and you're it.
{46752}{46809}That's quite a responsibility.
{46812}{46893}I don't want her hurt badly.|I don't want her hurt at all.
{46914}{47013}Do you think I do? I don't mind|what you have said, Mr Dawes.
{47016}{47087}But I wonder why did|you find it necessary to say.
{47090}{47165}Oh, I don't know. My sense|number six again, maybe.
{47168}{47258}- Number six?|- Another private joke. Good night.
{47261}{47310}Good night.
{47508}{47578}I have seen you like this|once or twice before.
{47596}{47668}When your characters do not|work out as you have planned,
{47671}{47757}or have taken a step themselves and|you're not sure what the next will be.
{47760}{47874}- Let's not talk about my script now.|- I'm not. You know I'm talking about me.
{47877}{47972}- It's not going to be easy.|- Has it been, up till now?
{48008}{48061}- Good luck, contessa.|- Don't call me that.
{48064}{48129}- I forget the Spanish for Cinderella.|- Nor that.
{48132}{48236}Some relationship! Three pictures|together and not even a nickname.
{48256}{48321}What is not going to be easy?
{48364}{48427}I wish I knew. I wish I knew.
{48933}{49013}{y:i} I saw her just once more|{y:i}after that wedding night.
{49025}{49077}{y:i}Twice, really.
{49080}{49140}{y:i}But the second time, she was dead.
{49232}{49290}{y:i}The first time was exactly a week ago.
{49319}{49387}{y:i}It rained all that day and all that night.
{49390}{49447}{y:i}It hasn't stopped since,|{y:i}come to think of it.
{49450}{49566}{y:i}I was holed up at my hotel,|{y:i}doing some last-minute rewriting.
{49569}{49626}{y:i}- |{y:i}- Avanti.
{49772}{49877}- Just because you're a contessa...|- Are you happy to see me?
{49883}{49980}Doesn't give you the right to walk out|of my life and then walk right back in
{49983}{50036}any rainy night you feel like it.
{50263}{50354}- I was just looking.|- There isn't much to see.
{50357}{50406}I'd like to decide for myself.
{50568}{50633}For a contessa who|doesn't drink... That's Cognac.
{50636}{50685}I know.
{50737}{50824}- How was your trip?|- You mean my... honeymoon?
{50827}{50904}Whatever you were going on|the morning after your wedding.
{50907}{50975}I don't want my honeymoon|to be called a trip. It was fine.
{50982}{51037}You've been away all this time?
{51090}{51150}How much time has it been?
{51153}{51290}I've never known a bride who couldn't tell|you to the minute - for the first year or so.
{51293}{51364}Thirteen weeks, three days,
{51424}{51473}seven hours and twelve minutes.
{51517}{51587}No, I've not been away all that time.
{51600}{51658}We've been home for ten weeks.
{51677}{51765}Nice of you to drop in.|Just passing by, I imagine.
{52012}{52077}You don't have to hide. It's just me.
{52080}{52129}I have to. I can't look at you.
{52161}{52257}Now, you didn't drive here|in a rainstorm "not" to look at me.
{52260}{52309}I'm on your side, remember?
{52469}{52518}Harry...
{52563}{52628}At any rate, this is what I have known.
{52651}{52716}I have known what it is like to be in love.
{52783}{52857}To be married in a church|to a man that I love.
{52918}{53018}And on my wedding night to wait|for him, with my heart full of love.
{53047}{53096}{y:i}
{53114}{53163}{y:i}
{53976}{54048}I have loved you all of my life.
{54075}{54173}This is why I have never been able|to love anyone else before you.
{54203}{54264}You have been unreal to me for so long,
{54289}{54427}it is hard to believe that all of this is not|something I dreamed a long time ago.
{54510}{54599}- Is it true that you love me?|- I do love you.
{54602}{54657}Maria,
{54660}{54740}there are things|that must be said sometimes...
{54743}{54798}for which there are no words.
{54801}{54940}Or at least no way to say them|so that they are not ugly and full of pain.
{55004}{55144}You find it hard to believe that this is not|just a dream you dreamed long ago.
{55160}{55228}It might very well be just that.
{55251}{55386}Almost everything that has to do with us|has been dreamlike up to now.
{55389}{55468}How we met and why we met.
{55471}{55573}Our understanding, without|question and without surprise,
{55576}{55631}that we were never to be apart again.
{55663}{55740}How much more like a dream|can a dream be?
{55777}{55931}But inevitably there comes a time|for waking up, even for us.
{55959}{56116}A time for facing the pain and ugliness|that can be kept out of dreams,
{56119}{56168}but not out of reality.
{56440}{56552}It is important that you believe|everything I say to you now.
{56598}{56653}I love you with all of my heart.
{56691}{56740}Do you believe me?
{56827}{56893}You are everything|I would want as my wife.
{56896}{56974}I would want no one else.|I am proud of you.
{56989}{57066}I want to make you as happy|as I can, as long as I live.
{57113}{57178}As for the rest of what I have to say,
{57181}{57286}you will find it neatly typed,|at some length, on this piece of paper.
{57312}{57372}Would it not be better if you told me?
{57395}{57444}No.
{57689}{57766}It looks like an army|document of some kind.
{57790}{57874}It is in Italian, and I do not understand.
{57877}{57926}{y:i}Che sarà, sarà.
{57954}{58003}That is also Italian.
{58020}{58076}Apparently, I am not to be let off anything.
{58129}{58196}Yes, it is an army document.
{58217}{58333}A medical report,|dated October 25th 1942,
{58350}{58413}from a base hospital in Benghazi.
{58416}{58473}It describes in detail
{58476}{58562}the degree to which my body|was blown apart by an explosion.
{58598}{58649}And, with understandable pride,
{58666}{58762}the skill with which they put|some of it together again.
{58797}{58892}Do you understand now|why it is so important to me
{58895}{58981}for you to believe that|I love you with all of my heart?
{59004}{59146}The report will tell you that|almost the only undestroyed part of me...
{59149}{59198}is my heart.
{59215}{59281}I love you with all of it.
{59605}{59670}{y:i}
{59745}{59794}{y:i}
{60502}{60551}{y:i}
{60852}{60901}So that was it.
{60927}{60976}What?
{61014}{61063}Nothing.
{61202}{61288}Tell me, how long could you stand it?
{61316}{61388}- What do you mean?|- How long could you stand it?!
{61405}{61476}- As long as I could.|- And who's the lucky peasant?
{61479}{61572}The gardener, the chauffeur, the stable|boy? Who's your cousin this week?
{61575}{61644}- I couldn't help myself.|- Neither could he!
{61664}{61713}That's the unholy pity of it.
{61744}{61823}The one man in all of your fantasy|and the one woman in all of his
{61826}{61893}who could have made each other happy.
{61896}{61972}And, once more, life louses up the script.
{61988}{62098}- But I will make him happy.|- Look, will he let you go back to work?
{62101}{62181}I can wind this one up in six weeks.|You can take him to California.
{62184}{62262}You weren't listening to me.|I'm going to make him happy.
{62275}{62355}How? How are you going|to make him happy?
{62374}{62433}By more of the same,|until you get caught?
{62436}{62512}- I don't want to get angry with you.|- Then why tell me about it?
{62515}{62564}Because I needed to tell you.
{62644}{62733}Harry, what do you think|would make Vincenzo happy?
{62761}{62922}You, as the perfect,|beyond reproach, last contessa.
{62975}{63026}That would only make him less unhappy.
{63034}{63094}What he would wish for|more than anything else
{63097}{63172}is that neither he,|nor his sister, nor I be the last.
{63175}{63251}- As a wish.|- It will come true.
{63288}{63337}What are you talking about?
{63340}{63405}- I have made it come true.|- You what?
{63443}{63526}What has happened to|your sense number six, Harry?
{63587}{63650}- Who knows?|- Only you and I.
{63653}{63724}- What about the father?|- It is not his concern.
{63727}{63779}The baby will be mine and my husband's.
{63782}{63872}- Do you really believe that?|- It will make Vincenzo happy.
{63886}{63955}Maria, don't you know|the man you are married to?
{63958}{64041}You're talking mawkish nonsense|you remember from cheap films.
{64044}{64132}Your husband is not out of James|M Barrie or Hans Christian Andersen.
{64135}{64219}He's a tortured, neurotic man,|who's finishing life on his own terms.
{64224}{64289}No, Harry. This time it is you|who does not understand.
{64292}{64345}I know Vincenzo better than you do.
{64365}{64414}Amen to that.
{64471}{64547}How much simpler it would be,|for so many of us,
{64564}{64664}if Kirk Edwards had not found it|necessary to look for a new face.
{64723}{64772}May I help you in any way?
{64822}{64892}- Who's going to tell him about it?|- I am, of course.
{64895}{64956}- When?|- Tomorrow.
{64971}{65109}- It will be difficult for me.|- Suppose he doesn't see it your way.
{65128}{65204}- What will you do?|- What every other woman would do.
{65207}{65291}- I will have my baby.|- What about... whoever he is?
{65305}{65403}That is all over. I'm going|to tell him now. Tonight.
{65406}{65457}That will not be difficult at all.
{67747}{67796}{y:i}
{68381}{68437}She's dead, Mr Dawes,
{68440}{68489}and so is he.
{68914}{68998}I have known for some time|that there was someone.
{69027}{69093}It may be a questionable compliment,
{69096}{69209}but I did not suspect you,|even though Maria visited you tonight.
{69248}{69297}What did she tell you?
{69362}{69411}What did she say to you?
{69442}{69511}She just wanted to talk...|about old times.
{69526}{69637}For a skilful writer, Mr Dawes,|you are an incredibly clumsy liar.
{70186}{70235}{y:i}
{70258}{70319}Did Maria have a chance|to say anything before...
{70322}{70404}No. What could she|have had to say to me?
{70444}{70493}Not a thing.
{70705}{70754}{y:i}
{71087}{71202}There is no need for you to stay,|Mr Dawes. I've sent for the police.
{71215}{71284}It may be embarrassing for you.
{71287}{71336}I'll hang around.
{71392}{71489}- Do you know any Spanish?|- Very little.
{71539}{71641}The Spanish word for... Cinderella?
{71760}{71815}I've been told a dozen times.
{71843}{71915}Just a word I keep forgetting.
{73351}{73432}Blue skies, boss.|We'll have some sun tomorrow.
{73435}{73514}Yeah, we'll get a good day's|work done tomorrow.

This is a true story.
How often have you seen that statement at the beginning of a picture?
It sometimes means that there was a man named Napoleon, but that any similarity between what he did in life and what he's going to do in this movie is strictly miraculous.
Well, this is a true story, about a sweet, rather baffled young housewife, who, in 1951, in her hometown in Georgia, suddenly frightened her husband by behaving very unlike herself.
There's nothing unique in that.
We all have moods.
We all have a secret yen to behave like somebody we particularly admire.
A modern writer has said that inside every fat man, a thin man is struggling to get out.
Well, in a literal and terrifying sense, inside this demure young woman two very vivid and different personalities were battling for the mastery of her character.
She was, in fact, a case of what is called
"multiple personality", something that all psychiatrists have read about and very few have ever seen.
Certainly not Dr Thigpen and Dr Cleckley, of the Medical College of Georgia, who one day were confronted with a woman who had one personality more than Dr Jekyll.
Their account of the case was delivered to the American Psychiatric Association in 1953, and it's already a classic of psychiatric literature.
So this movie needed no help from the imagination of a fiction writer.
The truth itself was fabulous enough.
And all the episodes you're going to see happened to this girl they call Eve White, and much of the dialogue is taken from the clinical record of the doctor we call Dr Luther.
The date is August 20th, 1951.
(woman) Come in.
- Mrs White?
- Yes, ma'am.
- Dr Luther.
- Yes?
Mrs White is here. The lady
Dr Watkins wrote to you about.
- Ask her to come in, will you?
- Yes, Doctor.
Will you come in, please?
- How do you do, Mrs White?
- How do you do?
- Come in. Sit here, will you?
- Thank you.
Mr White.
Let's see.
Thank you.
Dr Watkins is a very old friend of mine.
How long have you known him?
He's the doctor we go to.
He's a very able man. Very able.
Let's see. He says you've been troubled with very bad headaches.
Yes, sir, terrible ones.
- And some sort of spells?
- Yes, sir.
What kind of spell?
I don't know. l'm not exactly sure.
What happens when you have one?
Is it, uh, what they say, uh... amnesia?
Well, amnesia means loss of memory.
Is that what happens to you?
Yes, I guess that's it.
- How often does this happen?
- Sometimes twice a week now.
- And the headaches, what about them?
- Same thing.
- They happen at the same time?
- Yes, sir.
First I get this terrible headache and then I get this spell.
Now, when you say "spell", do you mean you faint or anything like that?
No, sir, it's not like faintin'. It's more like...
Well, it's like the other day I was playing out in the back yard with Bonnie and all of a sudden I got this splitting headache and then the next thing I knew,
I mean, the next thing I was conscious of, it was the next morning.
- Who's Bonnie?
- Oh, that's my little girl.
- How old is she?
- She's four and a half.
- Your only child?
- Yes, sir.
- I lost another baby about four months ago.
- I see.
And you have no recollection at all of what happened?
Where you were or what you did between the time you were playing in the back yard and the next morning?
No, sir, I don't.
Were you at home at the time?
I was there as soon as
I come home from work.
Yes?
I didn't see much different in her.
Well, did you see any difference?
I guess not. Nothing you could say was really different.
For several weeks Mrs White was greatly helped by the psychiatric treatment.
She had fewer headaches and they were less severe.
She had no more blackout spells - at least, none that she was aware of.
But not quite a year later,
several things happened that showed her to be in urgent need of help.
The first alarm was sounded around noontime of a spring day in 1952.
Anybody home?
Oh, hey. Just a minute while I hang out the wash.
- Where's Bonnie?
- Here I am.
- Hi, sugar.
- l'm wearing Mom's shoes.
Mommy will tan your britches if she finds you.
This one hurts.
- Where'd you get these?
- They're Mommy's.
- Where'd she get'em?
- The postman brought them today
- with the dresses.
- What dresses?
On the bed.
Evie?
- Let me have them.
- No! I wanna wear 'em. Mommy said I could!
Mommy! Mommy! Mommy!
What's the idea of all this?
Didn't you buy'em?
What do you mean, didn't I buy'em?
Didn't you?
No, I thought you did.
I thought it was sweet, but I...
It's got your name on it.
You know I wouldn't buy anything like that, Ralph.
- That's what I mean, they cost that much.
- Where'd they get your name?
- I don't know. I thought you did it.
I mean, I thought you bought 'em for me.
But I was gonna make you take 'em back because I knew it was too much. l'll say it's too much.
You had me scared there for a minute.
I guess they just must have made some kind of mistake, that's all.
Well, l'll call'em.
- Is this the Beehive Store?
- Yes, sir. Is there anrthing I can do for you?
- Is this Miss Effie?
- Who is this?
It's Ralph White.
For goodness sakes, I thought you and Evie would be on your way to Hollywood by now.
- Hollywood?
- With all those pretty things Evie bought.
You ought to be proud of how she looks in those dresses.
Especially that lilac one. l'm bringing'em all back this afternoon.
(Eve) Bonnie?
- Come on in, honey, and wash your hands.
- Tell her not to come in yet.
- What's the matter?
- Tell her l'll call her.
Never mind, honey. l'll call you when we're ready.
Shut that door.
Hurry up.
Come here.
Will you come here?
I got a good mind to slap your face.
- What'd they say?
- What kind of dope do you think I am?
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
What did you think I was gonna do? Nothing?
Let you get away with it? 218 bucks!
- I didn't buy'em.
- You mean Miss Effie Blandford's a liar?
- She said I bought 'em?
- She didn't say nothin' else.
I don't see how she could.
You mean to tell me you didn't try on those dresses?
I haven't been in the Beehive in months.
Sometimes I don't know whether you're crazy or you think I am.
Are they gonna take 'em back? l'll pack'em up for you.
- l'll do it.
- Let me.
You heard me. I said l'd do it.
(Bonnie) l'm hungry, Mommy.
(screams)
Evie!
(shrieks)
It's all right, honey.
(wails)
It's OK. You'll be all right.
It's all right, honey.
Don't get up. l'll kill you if you get up.
- I didn't do it.
- But I saw her.
I didn't do it.
How can she say a thing like that when I saw her with my own eyes?
- You mean you don't remember doing it.
- I didn't do it.
- I suppose you didn't buy those clothes?
- l'd die before l'd hurt Bonnie.
Why do you suppose Ralph says things like that if they're not true?
- I love her too much.
- You wouldn't come home last month.
She went to Atlanta and then wouldn't come home cos she was havin' too big a time.
When I went up to get her, she cussed me and said she never would come home.
- How about how much you loved her then?
- Will you let me talk to her alone?
She wouldn't come home to me or to Bonnie.
We'll just be a few minutes.
You didn't answer my question, Mrs White.
That's not true, what he said.
What's not true?
- I haven't been to Atlanta in nearly a year.
- That's what I mean.
Why do you think he says things like that if they're not true?
- I don't know.
- But he'd have to have some reason to do it.
- Yes, sir, I suppose so.
- Have you thought what that might be?
- I thought of one.
- What was that?
Maybe he wants to get Bonnie away from me.
- Do you mean by divorce?
- No, sir, maybe not that.
But maybe he can make me believe l'm losing my mind.
- Is that what you think he's trying to do?
- I don't know what else it could be.
- Am I?
- I find no evidence of it.
- But you're not positive.
- I couldn't be positive of anything so quickly.
But the fact you may be having spells of amnesia doesn't mean that you're what you call losing your mind. Doesn't mean that at all.
It's no use.
Cos I am. You don't want to tell me, but I know it now.
How do you know it, Mrs White?
Because now l'm hearin' voices too.
What kind of voices?
Just one voice.
But that's what that means, doesn't it?
- How long has this been going on?
- For months.
Why didn't you tell me this before?
What does this voice say to you?
She tells me to do things.
A woman's voice?
Can you recognise it in any way?
No, sir.
It sounds familiar sometimes, but I don't really recognise it.
What does this voice tell you to do?
To do things like... leave Ralph, take Bonnie and run away.
All kind of terrible things like that.
That is what it means, isn't it?
No, not in your case.
- But that's what everybody says.
- And in most cases they'd be right.
It's a serious manifestation, the hearing of voices.
But the difference in your case is this: you've been frightened by this voice because you recognise it as a symptom of illness.
People who are actually losing their minds rarely find anything extraordinary about hearing voices.
They almost invariably assume it's some sort of extra privilege that they enjoy, like personal radio reception or a built-in radar.
Yeah, but what if sometimes it... it sounds like my own voice?
Your own voice?
- Doesn't make any difference.
- Yes, it does.
You just don't wanna tell me, but it does, I...
Mrs White?
Hi.
Feeling better now?
I feel fine.
- What was it? A headache?
- No, I didn't have no headache.
She had one, but I didn't.
- "She"?
- You got a nice place around here.
Oh, she always gets those headaches when I wanna come out.
I think she's a real dope, don't you?
- Who are you talking about?
- Eve White.
It's these hose.
They're nylon and l'm allergic to nylon.
I think l'll take'em off.
You don't mind, do you?
If you like.
I think you'd better turn around, though.
You're kinda cute, but I don't think I know you that well.
Maybe sometime, though, huh?
- Hey, you like to go dancin'?
- Sometimes.
Would you like to go dancin' with me?
OK, you can turn around now.
- So you're not Eve White?
- I certainly am not.
Maybe one night this week.
You can tell your wife you gotta see a patient.
- And do what?
- And go dancin'.
I bet you're a real cute dancer.
I doubt if my wife would agree, but back to the point - if you're not Eve White, who are you?
Now what are you trying to do, kid me?
Seems more likely you're trying to kid me. l'm Eve Black. You know that.
- You mean that was your maiden name?
- That's still my name. l've never been married.
That's for laughs, gettin' married.
- What about Ralph?
- You don't think l'd marry ajerk like that?
And Bonnie isn't your child?
Not while l'm in my right mind she isn't.
Boy, what fat books.
Hey, is this radio working?
You got a back door to your office.
We could get out without him seeing.
- Will you excuse me?
- You're not gonna tell him, are you? l'll be right back. You wait here.
It's up too high.
Excuse me. l'll be right back.
Is that her?
- Ever had a case of multiple personality?
- No.
Do you think you'd recognise one if you saw one?
I don't know. l'm not so sure.
But I can tell you this, l'll bet ya
I can spot a fake as far as I can see one.
- Whom do you suspect?
- Mrs White. Mrs Eve White.
- That dreary little woman?
- That's the one.
(music louder)
Everything all right?
Oh, hi. Got your buddy with you, huh?
- May I turn this off?
- Oh, sure. What did I do, scare you?
- You remember Dr Day?
- Sure. Hi.
- How are you, Mrs White?
- That's what you think.
- This is Miss Eve Black, Doctor.
- How do you do, Miss Black?
How do you do?
- You don't mind talking to both of us?
- The more there are, the better I like 'em.
And you say you are not Mrs White now?
OK, you wanna hear it again?
I am not Mrs White. My name is Eve Black.
Then how does it happen that you remember meeting me?
Cos I know everything that happens to her.
She don't know anything about me, but I know everything about her.
Everything I want to, anyway.
There's some things about her l'm not interested in, like thatjughead out there.
Mr White, she means.
And the thing is, she don't really even care anything about him.
She tells herself she does cos she thinks she ought to.
Don't think I never told her so, too.
- What did you tell her?
- Leave the so-and-so.
Take the kid and beat it.
What can he do about it?
- How did you tell her?
- I yelled at her.
I don't know whether she heard me or not, but I really hollered at her.
Boy, I can tell you, though, l'm gonna fix his wagon.
I ain't gonna go through the rest of my life with that creep.
And you say that Bonnie is not your child?
Oh, now, Doctor. How could I have a child if l'm not even married?
You tryin'to insinuate somethin'?
- You mean Ralph never made love to you?
- Boy, l'd like to see him try.
Where were you, then, when Bonnie was born?
It looks like to me that's your problem,
Doctor, not mine.
Don't you have any fans in this office?
It's hot in here.
How are you gonna fix Ralph's wagon?
- You really wanna know?
- I do indeed. l'm gonna come out and l'm gonna stay out.
- Were you ever on the stage, Miss Black?
- No, not exactly on the stage.
But I sang in nightclubs, a lot of 'em.
- Where?
- Well, across the river's one.
- The Big Apple. You ever been there?
- No, l'm afraid I haven't.
They're crazy about me at the Big Apple.
Every time I go in there, they ask me to stand up and sing.
Of course, I have to be in the mood to do it, though.
- What kind of mood?
- I have to have a couple of snorts first.
Can you come out, as you call it, whenever you want to?
No. I wish I could, but I can't.
Sometimes I can, but sometimes I can't.
But it's getting easier. Cos she's gettin' weaker and l'm gettin' stronger.
And one of these days, l'm gonna come out and stay out, just you wait and see.
And can you retire, go back in when you want to?
Sure. You know what I done one night?
One night Ralph had to go to Savannah, so I went over to the Big Apple and I got kinda gassed up.
You know what I done the next morning?
I let her have the hangover.
(giggles)
- She's faking.
- Oh, you should have seen her face.
Listen, Mrs White,
I regret to have to say this, but I...
Hello, Doctor.
Mrs White?
On May 17th, 1952,
Mrs White was admitted to the psychiatric section of the University Hospital
for observation and treatment.
During the first week, her behaviour was excellent. There was nothing uneven about it.
But Dr Luther still could not decide when, or even if,
to confront her with the knowledge of the personality that she had suppressed.
"Love took up the glass of Time, and turn'd it in his glowing hands;
Every moment, lightly shaken, ran itself in golden sands."
"Love took up the harp of Life, and smote on all the chords with might;
Smote the chord of Self, that, trembling, pass"d in music out of sight."
That's beautiful. l've never heard it before.
Well, I don't really understand what it means.
I just like to read it anyway.
Doesn't have to mean anything in particular.
Good morning.
Would you like to read this one?
"Dear, beauteous Death..."
- Good morning, Doctor.
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Doctor.
- How's it going?
- Oh, I feel much better, thank you.
- She looks better, too, don't you think?
- Yeah, she really does.
- See you later, Mrs White.
- l'll be in the office, Doctor.
- Thanks, Lenny.
- Heard from Ralph?
- He came by for a few minutes yesterday.
- What about Bonnie?
- She's back with my mother and father now.
Tell me something, Mrs White.
Would you say that your marriage, speaking of it as a whole, has been a happy one?
No, sir.
Well, some of it, but not as a whole.
Don't you love Ralph?
Yes, sir.
Then why do you think it hasn't been a happy marriage?
I don't know.
I guess I just haven't been able to make him happy.
I don't know what it is I do that irritates him so much, but I do.
Well, tell me something else.
Have you ever had the feeling that, somewhere deep down inside you, there might be somebody you couldn't quite reach, but that you nevertheless knew was there?
No, sir.
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
- Good night, Doctor.
- Good night.
Hey.
Come here a minute.
Come on. I ain't gonna bite ya.
- Got a cigarette?
- Oh, sure.
- Thank you.
- It's all right.
- Why don't you come in for a minute?
- Well, no. No, you know the rules.
Aw, come on.
I got a poem for you.
Come on. Hm?
I... I can't stay long, though.
It's a limerick.
Chicken!
- Dr Luther?
- Yes?
- About Mrs White...
- Yes?
That lady is a whole lot healthier than you think she is, Doctor.
Can you control your emergence?
- Says which?
- I want you not to come out, even if you can. l'm tired of this place.
- It's a nuthouse.
- It's a hospital.
You don't see any bars or anything like that, do you?
Is she crazy?
No, but you can drive her crazy if you don't behave yourself.
Why? I don't know what I have to do with it.
I haven't got anything to do with her.
You're wasting your time with that. l'm a doctor.
- You're cute, you know that?
- Listen...
Hey, look, why don't you and I go out and have some fun? I can slip on somethin'.
Do you wanna be shut up in one of these places for life?
One with bars?
- What do you mean?
- I mean if you get into any trouble at all,
Mrs White will be adjudged crazy, but it'll be both of you that'll be locked up.
But why, if l'm all right?
You're not gonna be subdivided by any court or board l've heard of yet.
Where Mrs White goes, you go. And that means into an asylum if she's committed.
An asylum with locked doors and bars and straitjackets. Now, is that clear?
I guess so.
Well, it had better be.
Cos that'd be the end of it for you too.
No more dancing, no more... snorts, no more anything.
Ever.
Even if I don't come out, what do you figure to do about it?
I don't know. l'm not sure.
Nobody knows too much about this, because there haven't been too many such cases.
But for a starter... I think l'd like to tell Eve White about you.
What do you want to do that for?
- You object?
- Won't that worry her even more?
I thought you didn't care what happened to her.
I don't really.
But I mean, you know, if she worries any more, ain't she liable to go crazy anyway? l'm afraid that is a possibility, but that's a chance I think we're gonna have to take.
If we're ever gonna reunite these two personalities, to put it simply, l'd say the first logical step to take in that direction would be to introduce 'em to each other.
Introduce 'em? Ha!
Doc, you flip me, you really do.
Look. I don't have to put on much.
Let's go on out and have a little fun.
Mrs White.
I don't underst...
I had another one, hadn't I?
A little one.
I was hopin'...
I think l'd better tell you as well as I can just what the situation is.
Have you ever heard of multiple personality?
Now all Dr Luther had to do was to explain this situation to Ralph.
- How are you, Ralph?
- Good morning, sir.
- How's Evie?
- Much better now.
- Have you found out what's wrong with her?
- That's what I wanted to talk to you about.
It's a very unusual case.
One of the rarest, in fact, in the history of psychiatry.
You don't say.
Mrs White's problem is what is called multiple personality.
- Yes, sir.
- Have you ever heard of that?
- No, sir, I can't say as I ever have.
- What actually happens is this:
At some point in the past, apparently when she was a little girl, her personality became divided into two different personalities.
In effect, she's now two different women, entirely different in character.
To be more specific about it - the girl you married, Bonnie's mother, the sweet, quiet girl you fell in love with, that's one of the women.
The other is the one that scared Bonnie, the one who bought all those clothes and had that row with you in Atlanta.
You know those headaches and blackout spells?
Well, that was when this other woman, the one who calls herself Eve Black, was trying to get out.
Out of where?
Out of the body. Your wife's body.
Well, how do you like that?
But what I want you to understand is that this is an actual mental condition.
It isn't pretending or faking.
She can't help it.
But that doesn't mean she's psychotic.
Crazy.
Do you understand?
No, sir.
Well, let's see if I can put it to you in another way.
In the first place, no one has ever defined the personality as a psychopathological...
- I think you'd better come with me.
- Yes, sir.
(knock on door)
Come in.
- You've got company this morning.
- Hello, honey.
Hi.
- How's Bonnie?
- She's all right.
I asked Ralph to come in so that
I could explain the situation to him.
So he'll understand when you leave here.
You know who he is, don't you?
- You mean Ralph?
- Who is he?
Well, he's my husband, of course.
And you're the mother of his child, aren't you?
Of course.
- You're Mrs White? That's your name?
- Yes, sir.
All right, now, may I speak with Eve Black?
Of course.
Eve Black?
- Oh, spit!
- You know who this is?
- I sure do.
- Now, just a minute there.
Your husband?
If I have told you once I have told you ten thousand times, I ain't got no husband.
If I was gonna have one, it wouldn't be no lead-bottom like Ralph White.
- What'd you have to tell him for?
- Bonnie isn't your child?
- She's her child and you know it.
- I got a good mind to slap your face.
- l'd like to see you try.
- You ain't foolin' me.
Don't get angry.
Just talk to her and watch her.
And don't use your temper, use your sense about it.
May I speak to Mrs White?
You sure can. And don't ever bring me back while that pea-picker's here.
Mrs White?
- Did I go out again?
- Just for a few minutes.
- Evie?
- Eve Black?
- I told you I wasn't gonna talk to him again.
- Mrs White?
After she'd been in the hospital for two weeks, Dr Luther and Dr Day were satisfied
that whether she behaved as Eve White or Eve Black,
she would do no harm to herself or to others.
So, on 30th May, 1952, they discharged her.
During those two weeks, Ralph had left Bonnie with the grandparents
and found for himself a better job in Jacksonville, Florida.
But Mrs White was not to go with him.
For, on the advice of Dr Luther, she decided to stay in town, in a furnished room,
for further and more regular treatment.
This decision caused a separation that was to have unexpected consequences.
Might as well get started, I guess.
- Ralph, l'm awful sorry.
- That's all right. You couldn't help it.
Breakin' up everything like this.
Well, he can get you well, can't he?
- I hope so.
- Didn't he say?
- No.
- Didn't he say anything?
He said he'd do the best he could.
That's about the only thing he could do.
- Maybe.
- Well, I think he will, honey.
They don't like to promise too much, you know.
- You really think so?
- You know how some of 'em are.
They like to make a big thing out of it so as they look better when they knock it off.
The only trouble, though,
I sure am gonna miss Bonnie.
She's OK. Your folks will take care of her all right.
You don't have to worry about her.
Yeah, but if I don't get well,
I might never see her again.
Stop that, will you? Of course you'll see her again, cos you are gonna get well.
I mean, you ain't really crazy, you know.
He told me that hisself.
I mean, I asked him confidentially and he said no.
He said there were nothing the matter with you except this multiplied personality.
And that ain't anywhere near crazy.
Now, he told me that hisself.
You gonna stop worrying now?
- l'll try.
- You do that and you'll be all right.
Goodbye, honey. l'll send you some more money on Saturday.
Oh, you don't have to do that. l'm gonna get ajob.
That'd help, but l'll still send you some money.
You take care of yourself, you hear?
(hums)
- I feel like singing.
- So what's stopping you?
All right.
Hey. Do you know "Hold Me"?
You got it, pretty woman. OK, fellas...
- Stand back, Big Daddy.
- One, two...
(sings "Hold Me')
Oh, wait a minute. I forgot my shoes.
Thank you.
- Let's get outta here.
- No, l'm thirsty. I want a drink.
- l'll get us a bottle on the way.
- On the way where?
- Hey, how about a snort, tall, dark and ugly?
- Come on. l'll find a place.
What are you talking about?
This place is fine. I like it.
Look, I gotta be back to the post by one. Let's go.
Are you crazy? l'm not going any place with you. I don't know what you're talkin' about.
Don't give me that.
I didn't buy you all these drinks for nothing.
All right, l'll go with you some other time.
You're going with me now if you don't want some of this.
Stop it. That hurts. Let me go.
- See what I mean?
- You hurt me. I don't like to get hurt.
You know how much I shelled out on you already? Eight bucks' worth.
When I spend eight bucks on a chick,
I don'tjust go home with the morning paper.
So let's not have any more arguments about it.
What's the matter with you?
What kind of a gag is this?
Maybe she's sick.
Say, look, honey, I...
(sobs)
Ah! For the love of Mike.
We missed you Sunday.
Where were you?
- I went up on the bus to see Bonnie.
- l'll bet she was glad to see you.
- Oh, Ralph.
- Hi, Eve.
- Why didn't you let me know?
- I wanted to surprise you.
- Mr Fox, would you excuse us, please?
- Certainly, ma'am.
Siddown, won't you?
You know why I come up here?
I want you to come back with me.
- I can't do that. l'm not well yet.
- Who says you ain't?
Dr Luther. I know it's true.
I think it's even worse now.
Is he the one who told you to go out to the Big Apple every night?
That's... that's what I mean.
I didn't know about it.
Thought I wouldn't find out about it, huh?
- I didn't know about it, I tell you.
- You didn't know about it?
You knew enough about it to get ginned up.
You was well enough for that.
Fella I know saw you out there, twice.
Tight as a tick and dancin' and throwing your dress up.
Ralph, now,
Dr Luther explained all that to you.
He even showed you. You told me so.
Now, look. I don't know which one of you is foolin', you or him - but somebody is.
Because l've been askin' people about it.
I asked two doctors, and you know what they said?
They said it looked like somebody was kiddin' somebody.
But, Ralph, it is somethin'. Believe me, it is.
Then let it be something in Jacksonville.
Where are your bags? Let's get outta here.
If I don't check out of that motel by ten, they'll charge me for another six hours.
I won't leave here until l'm well again, not till I have Bonnie back with me.
OK, we'll get Bonnie and take her with us. l'm not gonna be alone with her, not till l'm well.
You're not gonna be alone with her?
She tried to hurt Bonnie once before.
She scared her.
Will you cut that out?
I don't wanna hear any more about it.
Why don't you just talk to Dr Luther just for a few minutes?
- No, I already talked to two regular doctors.
- Then l'm not going!
You know what you need?
You need a darned good whippin'.
- Knock some of that nuttiness out of you.
- l'm not goin' and that's all there is to it.
I suppose you'd rather stay here and go to that Big Apple.
Not until Dr Luther tells me I can leave.
And what if I don't want you by then?
Well, I can't help it. l'm not gonna leave here, not until l'm well.
- You don't want to see Bonnie again?
- Not until l'm well, no.
I wouldn't count on it then either, if I were you.
If you think l'll have people laughing at me, you got another think comin'.
If you were really crazy, it'd be different.
But not this multiplied thing.
So you don't come with me now, that's all there is to it, you understand?
I can't help it, Ralph.
OK, if that's the way you want it.
- (knock on door)
- Come in.
Hi.
Where'd you get that dress?
You like it?
- Did you buy that yourself?
- Got a lot of skirt, see?
- I never saw that dress before.
- That's because you've been away.
- Why don't you fix me one of them drinks?
- You kiddin'?
Well, don't you wanna give me one?
Well, I never seen you take a drink before.
There are a lotta things you never seen me do before. That's no sign I don't do 'em.
Are you gonna fix me one or not?
Don't look like to me you're awful glad to see me.
After comin' up all of this way, too.
Straight.
- You ain't foolin' me.
- I don't know what you're talkin' about.
- I know what you're tryin' to do.
- What?
You're tryin' to make me think you're that... that other one.
- What other one?
- You know what I mean.
You mean you don't even know your own wife when you see her?
You ain't Evie.
You think not?
I never seen Evie do a thing like that in my whole life before.
- You don't like it?
- That ain't the question.
Come here.
Oh, come on. Sit down.
Oh, come on. l'm not gonna bite ya.
You know, you're real cute.
- What are you up to?
- Well, l'm not up to a thing.
I just said you were cute.
Something wrong with that?
- No, but I...
- You know, I didn't used to go for you.
But you must be gettin' cuter these days, cos you sure look cute to me now.
Are you really...?
Really what? l'll be doggoned if I ever saw anything like this in my whole life before.
You ain't mad, are you?
No, I guess not.
You know what you ought to do?
What?
I think you ought to ask me to go to Jacksonville with you.
- I don't think so.
- Well, you asked her.
- I don't know if this is the same thing or not.
- You wanted her to go with you, didn't you?
Aah! Oh, oh, oh!
Oh, boy, you work faster than I thought you did. l'm gonna tell your wife on you.
What do you mean, my wife?
You are my wife.
That's not what you said a few minutes ago.
You really want to go away with me?
- Maybe. Only not tonight I can't.
- Why not tonight?
Cos I ain't got anything to wear to Jacksonville.
- We could pick up some things.
- Them ol' tacky things?
This is the only really nice dress I got.
It's gettin' kinda old.
Besides, can't go to Jacksonville with just one dress, even if it was new.
If I buy you a dress, will you go away with me?
Maybe. If you buy me a pretty one.
- Will you go now?
- I can't. Stores ain't open now.
- Don't you trust me?
- Sure. I just want the dress first.
OK. Give us a little kiss.
- Does that mean you'll buy me somethin'?
- I told you I would, didn't I?
OK. Butjust a little one.
(squealing)
- Hey, is that what you call a little one?
- Hey.
- What?
- Come here.
I think we'd better get started, don't you? l'll wait for you in the car.
Don't take too long, though.
- Won't you even sit close to me?
- Mm-mm.
Not until you buy me somethin' pretty.
(sings "I Never Knew")
You didn't have to wait up for me.
Shut that door.
All I was doin'was just dancin'.
Come here.
Come here!
You ain't mad, are you?
Oh, dear God.
Let's not kid ourselves. We're losing.
She's in worse condition today than when she walked in two years ago.
- The divorce, you mean?
- No, it's more than that.
I don't believe the divorce actually affected her seriously.
Bonnie's the only thing with her - not Ralph or marriage.
And that's the discouraging part of it.
The truth is neither Eve Black nor Mrs White is a satisfactory solution.
Neither of them is really qualified to fill the role of wife, mother, or even responsible human being.
A victory for either would be disastrous.
No solution whatever.
And as for memories, infancy, childhood...
Perhaps I should say childhoods - she says she's been coming out since she was six.
...an empty, almost abnormally normal history.
- Some patients are really so inconsiderate.
- They are indeed.
It wouldn't have hurt her to have had some shocking experience when she was little.
Something rather nasty she saw in the attic.
(buzzer)
- Yes?
- Miss Black is here.
- Miss Black?
- Miss Eve Black.
Tell him l'm all dyked out for him.
She's all dressed up for you.
Very pretty, with flowers in her hair.
- Miss Eve Black, in person.
- Want to try hypnosis again?
You mean keep punting and wait for a fumble?
- How do you do, Miss Black?
- Well, both docs.
You gonna protect him against me?
The way you look this morning, l'm not so sure he'd want me to.
Well, say, you look pretty sharp yourself, you know that?
She's your patient, Doctor. l'm much too old for that sort of thing.
He's pretty cute sometimes, don't you think?
He's a living doll. Will you come in?
Maybe l'd like him better than I do you.
- What's the idea of all this?
- I wouldn't let her come back.
- Why not?
- Cos something's wrong.
- You think so?
- Well, she tried to kill herself last night.
Something's wrong somewhere.
- How did she try to kill herself?
- With a razor blade.
She's feeling awfully low, and when I got what she had in her mind, it scared me half to death.
Cos you know, if somebody didn't stop her, l'd be gone too.
- Go on.
- Well, wasn't anybody else there but me.
So when she went in the bathroom and she locked the door... Look.
She made one slash and then I got out and I made her drop the blade and...
I got it and threw it away.
But it was a close call.
- Do you think she meant it?
- I know she meant it.
I wouldn't have meant it.
I might be tryin' to scare somebody or fool 'em or somethin',
but I wouldn't go that far.
- I understand.
- But she was really levelling.
She really was gonna kill herself if I hadn't stopped her.
When you said there was something wrong somewhere, did you mean something more than the effort to kill herself?
- I sure did.
- What?
Now l'm havin' blackout spells too.
You mean lapses of time when you don't remember what's happened?
And let me tell you, it scares me, too.
- May I speak to Mrs White?
- Of course.
Mrs White?
Eve Black tells me you were very low.
Yes, I was.
Would you mind going under hypnosis again?
If you say so.
All right. Now, relax.
Completely.
When I count to three, you'll be in a deep hypnotic state.
You understand? All right, now.
One...
Your eyelids are getting heavy.
Very heavy.
Two...
Relax.
Three.
Who are you?
Who do you think?
I have no idea.
May I ask who you are?
I don't know that either.
- Would you excuse me for a minute?
- Certainly.
How's your heart?
Can you take another one?
- You're kidding.
- Come on.
- Do you remember Dr Day?
- How do you do, Doctor?
- How do you do?
- Oh, well, then you must be Doctor...
- Luther.
- Luther. Yes, of course. I should have known.
- You mean you have heard of me?
- Yes, through both Eve White and Eve Black.
Not unfavourably, I trust.
On the contrary. They think very highly of you, both of them.
Are we to understand...?
This is a little awkward, but are we to understand that you're no longer Mrs White?
- No, l'm not.
- Nor Eve Black?
- No.
- Then may I ask, what is your name?
I don't know.
You do know Mrs White and Miss Black, don't you?
I know them in a way.
I don't think I know them very well.
But you know they're...
Yes, I understand that.
It's a pretty bewildering thing, too, isn't it?
I should say you were well within your rights in so describing the situation.
And may I add, it seems to grow no less so with the passage of time.
- I wish I understood it better.
- How long...?
It's not easy to phrase these questions without sounding like an idiot, but how long have you, well, been around?
I don't know. But I don't think it could have been very long.
- What do you know about Mrs White?
- Oh, what about Jane?
- Jane who?
- I mean, for my name. Jane.
Why Jane?
Why not?
And so now Dr Luther had three inadequate personalities
to complicate and confuse his search for one stable and complete woman,
all of whom continued to live, so to speak, their own separate lives.
Which would it be?
The rollicking and irresponsible playgirl?
Hey, you cut that out.
- I don't even know your first name.
- Ernie.
Ernie! (laughs)
The defeated wife?
Hill Brothers. Yes, sir, just a minute.
Hill Brothers.
- Hill Brothers.
- Thank you for waiting.
What? Well, just keep your britches on, sugarfoot. l'll get your party for you.
Let me figure out which one it is.
OK, that it?
What? Well, who are you?
Well, honey, you're not the right one.
No, get off the line, you're not...
Look, I don't care who you are.
Blast off, buster.
Or the pleasant young woman who had no memory?
What, in short, had nature, in the first place, intended this woman to be?
- Not yet, Janie.
- What's the use, Earl?
You did say you loved me, didn't you?
Yes, I did.
Well, then, is it fair to say you love me but can't marry me, without telling me why not?
- I just can't. I know it isn't fair. I just can't.
- What is it, honey? l'm not gonna let you get away with anything like this. You've got to tell me.
Please, Earl.
Just don't ask me any more. Please. l'm sorry, Janie, l've got to.
I can't give you up without even knowing what's the matter.
All right, then. l'll tell you.
Did you read in the newspaper about a month ago about a multiple-personality case?
A woman that has three personalities?
- In The Chronicle?
- Yes, that's the one.
- Yeah, I read it. What about it?
- l'm that woman.
You're the...
That's right.
But you sound all right.
- Do I?
- You sound fine.
Maybe I do, but not the other two.
Other two?
Sure. There are two others, you know, and they're very different from me.
And I don't even ever know when they're coming out.
Holy Moses.
- So that's all there is to it.
- Oh, no, it isn't.
- Oh, please.
- Not by a long shot.
What I mean is, that doesn't scare me.
I feel just exactly the same.
Exactly as I felt before.
I love you just exactly the same.
Maybe even more.
Whatever it is, we can handle it together.
Earl, don't you understand?
It's not you marrying me.
It's me marrying anybody. l'm sick. I am mentally sick and I cannot marry anybody, ever.
Then, on the afternoon of September 17th, 1953,
Mrs White came to the office for her regular treatment
and died there.
How are you, Mrs White?
I don't feel very well.
Let's go inside and talk it over, shall we?
You look tired.
Yes, l'm very tired.
I seem to be tired all the time now.
Has the lively Miss Black been keeping you out late?
Yes, sir, I guess so.
Anyway, I seem to be forgettin' more than ever now.
Well, that could also be Jane, you know.
Yes, sir. I know.
What do you think of Jane?
Well, from what you've told me,
I hope she'll be the one.
- The one to what?
- To live.
Is that what you think is going to happen?
That two of you will eventually disappear?
Don't you?
Well, I have thought so at times.
Well, that's what I think.
And I think it'll be Jane.
At least, I hope so.
Did you go up Sunday to see Bonnie?
- Yes, sir.
- Did you have fun with her?
I did for a while.
Then I forgot for a while.
Then I came back again, before I left.
Then, when I was saying goodbye to Bonnie, she said to me 'Don't come back that other way, Mommy. I don't like that other way.'
Eve Black?
I guess when I was up there last month she must have come out, and she must have been cross with Bonnie or slapped her or somethin'.
But then she said "Come back this way,
Mommy. The way you are now."
So I knew that it must have been Jane that came out this time when I forgot.
And she was sweet to Bonnie.
But then when Papa was driving me out of the yard,
I got the strangest feeling that
I wasn't ever gonna see her again, that this was the last time.
And I wanted to jump out of that truck and go hug her.
Try to explain to her and try to tell her...
But I don't know.
How do you explain to a little girl?
How do you make her understand that her real mommy ain't never coming back, but another woman who just looks like her?
Why do you think you'll be one of the ones to go?
It's just the way I feel, I guess.
I don't really mind. Not any more. l'm not fit for her now. l'm not fit for anything, really. I know that.
But if it's Jane...
If she'll just understand how much our little girl needs love and understanding, then I won't mind dyin'.
You know, if she'll just take good care of her for me.
- May I speak to Jane now, please?
- Yes, sir.
Jane?
Good morning.
Good morning.
It was me that came out on Sunday.
And while I was there, a curious thing happened that I think you might be interested in.
What was that?
Well...
Well, it was this.
Bonnie and her mother were out in the back yard.
They were playing ball.
You know, bouncing a ball back and forth.
Now, are you ready? All right.
Here it comes.
- Very good.
- Do it again, Mommy.
OK, here we go.
Uh-oh.
- Look, it's under the house.
- That's all right, honey. l'll get it.
You wait here, darling.
Mother will get it for you.
Can you see it?
Then, when I got under there, a strange thing happened.
Suddenly, I was littler.
I was a little girl under the house.
I could smell the odour of fresh earth, like a long time ago.
And morning glories, though there are no morning glories growing around there now.
And you still can't remember anything at all about your childhood?
No, not even of being a child.
Do you think Eve White might be able to remember it?
- I have no idea.
- May I speak with her, please?
Mrs White?
Jane tells me that when she came out up there on Sunday, when you were playing catch with Bonnie, the ball rolled under the house and she went under after it.
And when she got under there, she had a feeling of being very small.
A child.
A very curious and somehow frightening feeling, as if she'd been there before.
Now, this had some meaning for her.
Can you remember, when you were very little, any experience like that of any kind?
No, sir.
Will you think back to when you were five or six or seven years old, something like that?
No, sir, I can't remember anything like that under the house.
Perhaps under hypnosis?
Would you mind?
No, sir. I don't mind.
Will you close your eyes, please? Relax.
One...
Two...
Three.
Now, I want you to think back to when you were five years old.
Just a little girl on the farm.
A very little girl playing around the house in the back yard.
Sometimes you play under the house, don't you?
Yes, sir.
Did you ever go under the house for a ball?
- I don't remember.
- Was it dark under the house?
- Yes, sir, very dark.
- Did it scare you?
No, sir.
All right. Now you're six.
Six years old.
You're still playing around the house.
The back yard.
You still go under the house sometimes?
Yes.
Now, can you remember one particular time when something happened to you when you were under there?
I don't want to, please...
Did a ball go under the house?
I want my cup...
First give me my blue china cup.
I want my cup.
I don't want to.
I don't like all those flowers.
Please, I don't want to.
Mama, please, I don't want to.
There's too many people.
Please... Mama, don't make me.
Mama, please, don't make...
- Mrs White?
- What were you doin' to her?
- Eve?
- Of course. What are you tryin' to get at? l'll tell you. l'm interested in something that
Jane told me about being under the house, your mother's house, probably when you were about six years old.
It upset Mrs White very much.
Can you remember what it was?
- I didn't pay much attention to anything then.
- You came out then, didn't you?
Yeah. Only when I wanted to do something she didn't want to do.
Didn't she ever tell you about all those lickings she got for things she didn't do?
What are you doing out here now?
I didn't call you.
I don't know. I just had to, I guess.
Do you remember anything about a blue china cup?
I don't remember anything like that.
How long is this gonna go on?
Until we find out what's the trouble, of course.
- How long do you think that's gonna be?
- I have no idea.
You know what I think?
What?
I think l'm not havin' much fun any more.
You're still getting out, aren't you?
Not like I used to.
Is it Jane that's doin' that to me?
I don't know. What do you think?
I wish I knew more about her.
What do you want to know about her?
I don't know. It's not like it used to be, when I knew all about Eve White and she didn't know anything about me.
That's the way I liked it.
- It's all changed now, hasn't it?
- Mm-hm.
Now there's Jane.
Yeah.
Do you like her?
Very much.
- More than you do me?
- I don't like anybody more than I do you.
You never would go out and have a good time with me, would you?
A psychiatrist can't go out with a patient.
That's against the rules.
Would you go out with me if you wasn't a doctor?
Anytime you'd let me.
Does she know all about what I do?
Does she tell you?
When I ask her.
Like about that sergeant?
- Yes, she told me about that.
- That's what I mean.
Somebody around all the time, telling on you.
- You tell me about Mrs White, don't you?
- Yeah, but she don't do anything.
You know somethin', Doc?
What?
You remember that red dress?
The low-cut one?
How could I forget it?
I want you to have it.
A low-cut dress, for me?
I want you to have it if anything happens.
What do you mean, if anything happens?
Something's the matter.
I don't know what it is, but something's the matter.
You don't think we're ever going to get well, do you?
Of course I do.
Well, I don't.
I think we're gonna die, all of us.
Eve.
- You didn't think I could cry, did you?
- You never have before.
You know, I remember the first time I ever saw you.
You was the first one I ever said who I was.
First one ever knew me.
You liked that red dress, didn't you?
Very much indeed.
I think it's a beautiful dress.
Well, I want you to have it.
Cos you're the only one that knows what it's meant to me. The only one.
I know of nothing that's gonna happen to you, but I do appreciate the dress, believe me.
Now, may I speak to Jane?
- Of course.
- Jane?
Goodbye, Doc.
Goodbye, Eve.
Jane?
Yes.
What do you think she meant?
I don't know.
Have you remembered about that blue china cup? Or under the house?
- No.
- Mrs White?
No!
No, Mama! Mama, please don't make me!
Please, please, please!
Please don't make me,
Mama, please! Please don't...
- Jane?
- Please, please!
- What happened, Jane, under the house?
- She made me kiss her!
She made me kiss her!
Mama, please!
(children chant) l'll beat you! l'll beat you!
- l'll beat you!
- l'll beat you!
Evie! Evie?
- Come on, sugar, time to get your clothes on.
- l'll be there in a minute, Mama.
Come on, Evie. I don't want to come in there after you.
You come on this minute, do you hear?
You've got to kiss Grandma goodbye.
Then you won't miss her so much if you kiss her goodbye, sugar pie.
You know that.
Please don't make me.
I don't want to. Oh, Papa.
Evie, darling. Evie, you do like your mommy says.
Come on, now, you give her to me.
I know, sugar. All you've got to do is kiss her.
- Don't make me, please.
- Then you won't miss her so much.
- Mama, I don't want to, Mama.
- You've got to kiss her goodbye.
I don't want to. Please, Mama.
(sobs) Please, please! I don't want to.
Kiss her goodbye, so you won't miss her so much.
(screams hysterically)
She didn't mean any wrong by it.
It was just the way people thought in those days.
If you kissed the dead face, it was a sweet goodbye and you wouldn't miss her so much.
That's all she meant.
Do you think a great deal about death now?
No.
Just that...
"Life's a city full of straying streets, and death's the marketplace where each one meets."
Just that. Someday, it'll happen.
Who wrote that? That poem?
- Shakespeare, wasn't it?
- Where did you learn it?
In high school.
Mr Montgomery recited it to us one day.
- Who was Mr Montgomery?
- The English teacher.
Who was your first teacher? Your very first, when you first started going to school?
That was in Fortsville. Miss Bates.
In the second grade?
Miss Bates in the first grade.
Miss Griffith in the second grade.
Miss Stewart in the third grade.
And... and then we moved to Richmond and we had Miss Patterson in the fourth grade.
Do you remember all of them?
- May I say 'em?
- Go on.
And in Richmond, we lived on Fifth Street.
27 Fifth Street.
Right next door to the Thompsons.
Rick and Mary Lou Thompson.
And... and Mr Thompson worked at the railroad, in the machine shop.
Because I remember one Sunday he took us all down to look at the machines.
Rick and Mary Lou and Florence and myself.
Florence is my cousin.
- I remember.
- May I speak to Mrs White?
- Do you have to?
- Mrs White?
She's gone.
Eve?
- They're gone.
- Eve Black?
They're gone, I tell you. Both of them.
They're gone and there's nobody else here but me.
I know it. I can feel it.
And I can remember.
I can remember everything.
Mama and Papa and Bonnie...
I can remember.
Oh, I can remember, I can remember.
That was in the fall of 1953.
On September 17th, 1955,
Dr Luther received a special-delivery airmail letter from Richmond, Virginia.
(Jane) "Dear Dr Luther,
Do you remember what today is? "
"It's the second anniversary of that day in your office,
and still no more Eve White and no more Eve Black."
"That's why we decided it was safe at last to have Bonnie with us."
"And so here we all are, Earl and Bonnie and me, going home together."

Your attention, please.
Now arriving from Los Angeles
at Track 3...
Central Pacific train number 10...
the Forty-Niner now arriving
from Los Angeles.
You handle the bags.
I'll meet you at the taxi stand.
Yeah, sure.
- Redcap.
- Yes, sir?
- Those two there.
- Yes, sir.
You going on East or staying over?
Neither. Going back tonight.
Golden West Limited, Los Angeles.
- Why, that train leaves in an hour, sir.
- Yeah, I know.
- Just be sure those two are aboard.
- Yes, sir.
Car 10, rooms A and B.
- Okay.
- Thank you.
- 9417 Water Street, South.
- Okay.
Yeah, and if you know any shortcuts, driver, take them.
Relax, Walter. We'll make it okay.
If we don't, I know a couple of suitcases that are going to be awfully lonesome.
Your cigar is dead.
Thanks. I'm thinking of changing brands.
Something with a self-starter on it.
Bet you're wondering the same thing I am: What she looks like.
I don't have to wonder. I know.
Why, that's wonderful, Walter.
Nobody's seen her, but you know what she looks like. What a gift.
Come off of it. You're just making talk.
Well, we'll get there just as fast talking.
- What about this dame, Mr. Crystal Ball?
- A dish.
What kind of a dish?
Sixty-cent special: Cheap, flashy, strictly poison under the gravy.
Amazing. Now, how do you know all this?
Well, she was married to a hoodlum, wasn't she?
What kind of a dame would marry a hood?
All kinds.
Oh, Gus, at heart you're still a boy scout.
Maybe it's just old age coming on.
Anyway, I got $5 that says you're wrong this trip.
- What can I lose?
- $5. You're on.
Slightly out of the high-rent district, isn't it?
- Well, nobody tailed us.
- You hope.
Wait here, driver.
Douse your lights, will you?
Number 10.
You want to double my bet?
- Who is it?
- Forbes.
It's okay.
- Det. Sgt. Brown.
- All right.
What's the music for? A welcome?
You don't know how welcome.
Turn that thing off.
Your escort's here.
Forbes and Brown. Los Angeles.
How nice. How's Los Angeles?
Sunburn wear off on the way out?
If you don't mind, Mrs. Neall, we're a little short of time.
- Our train leaves in half an hour.
- Just a minute.
I can pack my own things.
First, I want to know who I'm going with.
- You're going with us.
- Don't be too sure of that.
How do I know you're cops?
- Was I right?
- Don't rub it in.
- I owe you $5.
- Better show her your orders.
- She's afraid of a trap.
- You bet I am.
Getting killed sort of runs in our family.
They got Frankie, and his widow's next.
I'm taking a big chance.
Okay. Here's the DA's signature.
We're taking a big chance, too, you know.
If we don't get you to the Coast, it'll cost us our jobs.
- You're breaking my heart.
- You satisfied?
All right, I'll get my things together.
- So long, mother.
- Have a nice trip.
- She's all yours, boys.
- Okay, Wilson.
"Rumor of grand jury to hold special session.
"Hint slain ganglord's widow...
"may testify in graft probe."
The word gets around, doesn't it?
That's what's worrying me.
Frankie carry any life insurance,
Mrs. Neall?
Quit hinting.
Well, I thought he might've left you an annuity.
Not cash exactly, but something just as good.
Like that payoff list they talk about.
I heard you the first time.
You'd like a look at that list, wouldn't you?
Well, I like to feel I'm in the know.
Buy a paper, the first thing I turn to is the gossip column.
- I'll read them off to you sometime.
- When?
When the grand jury asks me and not before. So quit making a pest of yourself.
- And get your hands off my baggage.
- All right, let's get out of here.
I'm ready.
After you.
Your friend's dead, mister.
You heard him. He's dead.
Get me out of here.
- Well, what're you waiting for?
- Shut up.
You saw this.
- Did you get a look at the man in the hall?
- Not his face.
I was trying to remember.
He was about your height.
Had on an overcoat.
Go ahead. I'm a police officer.
Sgt. Brown, Los Angeles.
What else about him?
Well, there was something about that overcoat.
That guy may be back.
Are we going to hang around here all night?
- Cabbie, get her bags.
- Yes, sir.
You better call the police.
Hey, I know what it was.
That coat had fur on it.
Dark fur around the collar.
Well, get them on the phone.
Tell them what you know.
- Say I'll wire a report.
- Yes, sir.
Back where you came from, only faster.
Charley horse?
The one time I let him go first, it happens.
Forbes?
Yeah, he was getting old and slow.
You could put a live bomb in his hand and count 10 before he'd drop it.
I'll never forgive myself.
Well, this is fun.
Some protection they sent me.
An old who walks right into it, and a weeper.
How you expect me to feel? He was my partner for six years. He broke me in.
Why, he and his wife and I were...
What am I going to tell her?
- What're you doing? Keeping score?
- Yeah, one down, two to go.
Well, don't kid about it. Whoever that was, they were trying to get me.
How long will my luck last?
As long as there are cops like Forbes around to get killed for you.
- Like you, I suppose.
- Yeah, like me.
Well, my taste doesn't usually run to cops... but you might not be such dull company at that.
Mrs. Neall, we better get one thing straight.
You're just a job to me. A COD package to be delivered to the LA grand jury... and there's no joy in it.
I don't like you any more than Forbes did, but he got himself murdered for you... and maybe I will, too.
That's what they pay me for.
- Do we understand each other?
- Relax, Percy, your shield's untarnished.
I've changed my mind.
I wouldn't want any of that nobility to rub off on me.
It won't, if you keep your distance.
All the way to the Coast?
- Poor Forbes.
- What about poor Forbes?
He owed me $5.
Driver, about two blocks from the station, let me out.
- What's the idea?
- You're on your own till the train starts.
Tickets, money. You pay the driver.
- I don't get it.
- Just do as you're told.
They haven't seen you yet, they don't know what you look like.
But they've seen me. If they shoot in my direction, I don't want you hit.
- You're sure it isn't the other way around?
- When you get to the station, walk... don't run to the platform.
Carry your own bag.
Go straight to car 10, room B, and lock yourself in.
If the lights are on, turn them off and leave them off.
- Don't forget to pull the shade.
- Suppose I stand you up?
I'm not too keen on this grand jury business.
You've forgotten about the guy with the fur collar. You can't stand him up.
In the morning they'd be fishing you out of the Chicago River.
I'll see you aboard.
Keep the change.
- May I carry your bags?
- No, thanks, I'll carry them.
... now ready for occupancy on Track C.
Leaves in five minutes. Okay, I'll tell him.
Densel had bad luck. He got winged, too.
Up to us, huh?
Tail Brown. She's with him.
What's she look like?
He never saw her face.
Just keep your eye on the cop.
They'll be on the train together someplace.
- Better get started.
- Who covers us? Just in case.
Leave that to Densel.
I'll be in the club car.
Central Pacific, train number 5...
Golden West Limited for Kansas City...
La Junta, Albuquerque and Los Angeles...
departing on Track D in five minutes.
Conductor C. Arnicob, please report
to the stationmaster's office.
Central Pacific, gate number 5, Golden...
- Your bags are inside, sir.
- Okay, fine. Thanks.
It's me, Brown. Open up.
- Well, are we okay?
- I'll tell you in a minute.
All aboard!
The answer is no.
- They know I'm here, don't they?
- Take it easy.
Who followed you?
The man in the fur collar?
No, but someone from the same stable, I guess.
Some creep with a one-track mind.
Well, what're you going to do?
How are you going to handle it?
Why did you let him follow you?
They promised me protection.
Shut up.
- They said it would...
- Shut up, do you hear?
I got enough on my mind.
It's a rotten detail. I don't like it.
I didn't like it from the start.
My partner's dead and it's my fault.
He's dead and you're alive.
Some exchange.
Lock it.
This gentleman's lost a briefcase.
We thought the redcap might have put it in here by mistake.
I don't think so. These are mine.
It was a pigskin case.
Well, we'll keep looking.
Sorry to bother you.
I'm sure it's in this car.
What about this next room?
The room's empty.
As a matter of fact, conductor,
I was going to speak to you about that.
My partner was held over in Chicago.
We won't be needing this space.
Both rooms are paid for through to the Coast. I'd like a rebate.
I'll wire the passenger agent in Kansas City.
- We'll try to sell it for you there.
- Much obliged.
- I hope you find your case.
- I will.
It's all right.
That was the one, wasn't it?
Yeah, he seems to have me spotted anyhow.
I haven't got a chance. He'll be back.
Once he finds me, goodbye.
- Maybe not.
- Are you kidding?
I can't hang out the window.
And the upper berth's too small.
- What are you going to do? Measure it?
- You gave me an idea.
Well, I don't like it already.
I'm in a spot, Brown, and it's your job to protect me.
- It's your move.
- You're wrong, it's his.
We're going to let him make it, Mrs. Neall.
- Care for something, sir?
- What?
Yes. The same as hers.
I'll finish this at another table.
- I'm terribly sorry.
- That's all right.
- Here, let me.
- It'll dry.
I'm sorry.
Don't I even get a chaser?
I'm really sorry.
At least let me pay for your drink.
No, this one's on me, too.
- Fix her another, please.
- The same as his.
So sorry.
Some day they'll get around to paving this track.
Then these accidents won't happen.
Here's to better tracks and steadier nerves.
- Mine or yours?
- Yours.
You know, you'll get there just as fast if you relax.
That sounds familiar. You're right.
I am a bit on edge tonight.
Excuse me.
Wait! Your...
I'm sorry. Thank you.
Pardon me. I'd like to get through.
Sorry. This train wasn't designed for my tonnage.
Nobody loves a fat man, except his grocer and his tailor.
Yeah, how about that?
You're Mr. Kemp, aren't you?
Joseph Kemp?
- That's right.
- There's a wire for you.
By the way, this isn't your space, is it?
No. I was looking for that briefcase.
I thought it might be in the other room.
- Only I was wrong.
- I'm afraid you were, Mr. Kemp.
Can't blame a guy for trying, can you?
There's somebody in here.
What do you want? Who are you?
I know. He's a train robber.
No, just a passenger. I must have gotten into the wrong compartment.
- Indeed you did.
- Mine must be in the car ahead.
- Do you carry a gun?
- Let the man be.
He made a mistake, so let him go about his business.
Thank you, madam.
But if his business is robbing people, we ought to call the police or something.
Good night, son.
Terribly sorry. Good night.
Hey, the next car doesn't have compartments. It's a day coach.
- I bet you he is a robber.
- Come back here. This instant.
Close that door.
All right, but I'm going to lock it.
It's all clear. Give me your bag.
Well, did he go for it or didn't he?
He bit. Searched both rooms.
You're the little girl who wasn't here.
Lucky me.
Chances are they will look for you here again.
- What do you mean "they"?
- Oh, it's just a hunch.
These birds travel in pairs sometimes.
Don't worry about it.
You're still a mystery to them.
It's a long train, you're not the only woman passenger aboard.
I'm the only one who won't sleep tonight.
I know a woman who won't sleep for a lot of nights.
Who?
Forbes's wife.
Mr. Brown, I have a business proposition you might be interested in.
Never carry one. Got no stomach for it.
Okay if I put my hands down?
My name's Yost. Vincent Yost.
- So?
- I'd like us to have a little talk.
We're ready to make a deal.
You have her. We want her. How much?
It's as simple as that.
You're under arrest.
- For what?
- Attempted bribery.
Bribery? You'd never make it stick.
I'm a sales executive for the
Midwest Equipment Company, Chicago.
I've never even gotten as much as a parking ticket.
We'd like to settle this reasonably.
- Is that why you killed Forbes?
- Forbes?
Oh, I didn't know. I'm sorry.
We got word of your coming so late that we had to improvise.
Believe me, my company doesn't like to do business that way.
I know his wife would be happy to learn that. Also his two daughters.
And the bank that holds the mortgage on his house.
It's to our own interest.
That's why I'm here.
I know that there can be a meeting of the minds if you'll listen.
I'm not interested.
Not in $25,000 or $30,000?
You name your own figure, Mr. Brown.
I'm sure that we can strike a favorable agreement.
My friend has a heavy investment in this matter.
Several of our key personnel are involved.
Not at any price.
You dismiss it so lightly.
I can see you've never known what it feels like to have that much money of your own.
- May I put my hand in my pocket?
- Go ahead.
$5,000. A sample.
How much does a policeman earn?
$300, $400 a month?
We offer you a fortune.
- And what do we ask in return?
- What?
That you point her out and turn the other way.
You go through the motions of guarding her, until the accident occurs.
No.
- Now why do you say that?
- I don't like murder.
A gangster's wife?
Believe me, the world's better off without her.
Just think it over. Think what you could do with a lot of money.
Of course, if you're really concerned about the Forbes family... you could give it to them.
Meanwhile, we'll keep looking.
We'll get her whether you give her to us or not, so don't take too long.
It would be a shame if you missed your opportunity.
I'm sure you'll find me when you make up your mind.
What're you going to do?
Shoot something for breakfast?
Sure. Name it.
Eggs, bacon, toast, a bucket of coffee and some cigarettes. I'm famished, Brown.
Okay, I'll share it with you.
I don't want them counting trays.
Here's some cigarettes. Get your appetite under control while I find a waiter.
This is a modern train.
Why don't you ring for him?
I want to look around first.
Get in there and keep the door locked.
I like my bacon crisp and lots of butter on the toast, please.
- It's all yours.
- Thanks.
I know you, I saw you sneak out of there.
You said you had a compartment.
- Take it easy.
- Take your hands off me.
He's a robber. Last night he snuck in on us and I just saw him sneaking out of...
- That's a good boy. Let's go, son.
- Let me go!
Say, he's some little scrapper.
- Yeah, we're training him that way.
- Put me down!
Put me down!
Take your hands off me.
- Help!
- Here's your boy, madam.
Tommy, where on earth have you been?
- He got lost.
- I did not.
He's got a gun under his arm. I felt it.
Call the police.
- He's very excitable.
- You're probably feeding him wrong.
- Too many oats.
- The police will lock him up...
- and they'll take his gun away.
- Come along, Tommy.
- Find your case?
- No. But I'm still looking.
Good morning.
Oh, hello. How are you?
I was just on my way to the dining car.
So am I. Still rushing, I see.
Yeah, I'm kind of busy this morning.
- One, sir?
- Yeah.
This way, please.
Rushing around the way you do must work up quite an appetite.
- What did you say?
- I said you must be hungry.
Oh, I can always eat.
- You people together?
- No, I'm not eating.
What?
Don't mind me.
I have something else on my mind.
Not food, obviously.
Your change. Remember?
You went off and forgot it last night.
I guess I forgot something else, too.
No, I took the tip out.
Your reputation's first-rate... in the bar.
Meaning it's not so good here.
All right, consider yourself apologized to.
But I'm really not hungry.
Excuse me. Just a wire to the home office.
And I wish you'd get those nerves quieted down.
Yeah, I'm working on it.
Toast and coffee.
The gentleman's not having any.
Yes, ma'am.
Pardon me.
I beg your pardon, sir.
Always meeting in a tight place, aren't we?
This makes twice.
As a matter of fact, I'd like to speak to you, if you'll pardon the intrusion.
- My name is Jennings. Sam Jennings.
- What's on your mind?
A little deal.
Possibly an accommodation for both of us.
Certainly for me.
The gentleman at the other table says that... you want to dispose of a spare compartment.
I'd like to take it off your hands.
That's very kind of you, Mr. Jennings, but I've decided to keep the compartment.
May I ask why?
You can't sleep in two rooms at once.
Sorry. That's my business.
But this is preposterous.
Yours is the only available space on this train and I'm in an upper berth.
Young lady, does that seem fair and equitable?
Me at 265 pounds in a hatbox... while this fellow monopolizes two spacious compartments.
Well, maybe he has his reasons.
I'm sorry, but that's the way it's got to be.
Possibly not.
We'll see what the conductor has to say about this.
I guess I have some explaining to do.
Explain it to me sometime, too, will you?
Excuse me.
- Steward.
- Yes, sir?
Send me some breakfast, car 10, room A.
- Bacon, eggs, toast, let's see...
- Coffee, sir?
Yeah, that's right, plenty of it.
Thank you, sir.
There he is. If you don't believe me, search him. The gun's under his arm.
If you're a good boy,
I'll show you the gun sometime.
Show it to me now!
Come on, son. You're blocking traffic.
Attaboy.
Then you have got a gun!
All robbers carry guns, madam.
I don't believe it.
I told you, didn't I? He never fooled me.
How's my little boy this morning?
Swell. We caught a robber, but he got away.
Nanny wouldn't believe me, would you, Nanny?
It was a little mix-up, Mrs. Sinclair.
This man got into our room by mistake.
Who was he?
Just a passenger.
I'm sure it was an accident.
It was not. He's sneaking all over the train.
That is odd.
I'd like to hear more about this, Tommy, but not now.
What would you like for breakfast?
Tommy, you heard your mother.
What do you want to eat?
I'm not hungry.
All right. We'll just have to order for you.
Waiter.
We'd like some orange juice, oatmeal, and milk for the boy.
Yes, madam.
Mr. Brown, I'd like a word with you.
Okay. I might as well tell you
I don't want to sell that compartment.
Isn't there some rule about this?
Not that I know of.
If a passenger pays for space and doesn't use it, that's his business.
The point is I may be using that space, or my partner will.
I thought he stayed in Chicago.
He took the plane. He'll join me later.
We're going on to LA together.
- All right, let's drop it.
- I'll see what I can do for you at La Junta.
Oh, conductor.
I was gonna ask him how long we stop over there.
La Junta is a 12-minute stop.
We ought to be pulling in there in two minutes.
Thanks.
I could've sworn I heard dishes rattle and smelled coffee.
It's on the way. It'll be here any minute.
I may not last that long.
The train is stopping.
- Where are we?
- La Junta, Colorado.
Don't peek at the sights.
Why don't you go in and play cards?
I can't.
I ate the deck.
Central Pacific train number 5.
Golden West Limited...
westbound for Albuquerque
and Los Angeles...
will remain in the station for 12 minutes.
Passengers may obtain sandwiches
at the newsstand...
and souvenirs inside the depot.
- Good morning. Your breakfast.
- Fine.
- Is a table ready?
- No, I'll set it up myself.
- I'll be glad to do it.
- Don't bother. I'll do it.
All right, sir.
What're you giving me this for?
It's your breakfast, sir.
- You said...
- Nothing of the kind. I never eat breakfast.
Hello again.
For a man who's not hungry, you get your food in strange ways.
Me? I didn't order this.
There must be some mistake.
Begging your pardon, sir.
It says, "Room A, car 10.
"Bacon, eggs, toast and extra coffee."
- Somebody ordered it!
- Not here they didn't.
Why don't you try the next car?
Everybody makes mistakes.
- I guess so. Excuse me, ma'am.
- Yeah.
I'm never hungry before noon.
But you said you could always eat.
Not on trains.
I always eat light. Sandwiches...
- What's the matter?
- That man on the platform.
He keeps staring.
- At you or both of us?
- At me mostly.
He probably thinks I'm somebody else.
It's funny.
Sometimes it's not so funny.
I'm not going to worry about it.
Life's too short.
- Yeah, isn't it?
- I want to get something in the station.
Wait, I'll go with you.
I have a wire to send.
Might even work up an appetite and grab a sandwich.
I think I'll find what I want in there.
I'll be with you in a minute.
A couple of sandwiches.
Did you see this?
Sad, isn't it?
Makes you wish you could do something.
Straight wire. Urgent.
That'll be $1.69.
Thank you.
Well, can I see the gun now?
Son, I'm going to need your help.
- I bet you can keep a secret, can't you?
- Well, maybe.
It's all right.
I'm just letting him in on a secret.
You'd better come with me.
You've bothered this man enough.
No, I want to hear it.
You go buy your magazine.
Very well, but we've got to get right back on the train.
Come here.
Where's our wandering boy?
I've got him in sight, Mrs. Sinclair.
He's talking to his train robber.
So that's who it is.
- Tommy.
- Yes, Mother!
I thought the other lady was your mother.
Nanny? She's my nurse. Come on.
I won't tell them anything.
We've solved one of the mysteries about you.
I understand you rob trains for a living.
No, he doesn't. I just thought he did.
I'd believe anything.
I'm surprised you don't.
I'm surprised, too, about Tommy being your son, I mean.
Anyway, he's on my side now.
- We've got a secret. Is that for me?
- Yes, darling. You're going to like this.
An Indian hat.
That's a genuine headdress, darling.
A real Indian chief made it.
Gee, thanks, Mom.
Look what I've got, Nanny.
Don't forget. No one knows but us.
That's a promise.
You're very persuasive.
A while ago, he was all for having you locked up for armed robbery.
That's before he knew
I was on a secret mission.
Oh, I see. That would explain anything.
You're quite inventive.
Oh, he's a very sensible boy.
He didn't press for details.
In that case, I guess I should take a hint.
At least you're one up on me.
You know I'm not a train robber.
All I know about you is you're a married woman with a young son.
- Is that so unusual?
- No, not unusual. Just unexpected.
I hadn't figured on it.
That sounds like you've given it some thought.
I didn't know I'd made that much of an impression.
Maybe you're like the train.
When it's moving, everything is a blur.
When it slows down and stops, you begin to notice the scenery.
I hadn't thought of it that way, but you're right.
It's too bad we've got to start moving again.
Yes, we'd better be getting back.
Your change, sir.
- Mark that right, will you?
- Yes, sir, thank you.
Aren't you coming in?
I have business to attend to first, but I'll be back.
Please don't feel you have to because of me.
Excuse me.
Maybe I want to.
Because of you.
It's your turn to make way, my friend.
Come on, open it.
- You took your time.
- What's the idea of playing that?
- You want them to come in here shooting?
- I'll apologize later. Where's the sandwich?
Well, take the paper off first.
Cheese. How thin can a sandwich get?
Here, take half of mine.
Take it all. I can't eat.
That's because you've been packing away steaks behind my back.
Stop it. I've got more on my mind than food.
Would it be that girl that beat me out of my breakfast?
You're pretty sharp, aren't you?
It's not what you think.
It's exactly what I think.
Why don't you admit you put her on the spot and let me congratulate you?
- How'd you figure that out?
- I heard you through the door.
That hood wasn't looking at her big blue eyes.
He thinks she's me, and I think that's dandy.
- What's the matter with it?
- Nothing.
Nothing from your standpoint.
You're doing...
Sure, I'm still breathing. The food stinks and so does your company.
I'll hand you one thing, though, Brown.
You're showing real genius.
Will you smooth that out a little?
Making this dame the target shows you're using your head.
I didn't rig it that way.
If you didn't, the DA is entitled to a refund.
Sister, I've known some pretty hard cases in my time.
You make them all look like putty.
This is not a sack of gumdrops that's going to be smashed... this is about a dame's life.
It may seem funny for a woman with a kid to stop a bullet for you... only I'm not laughing!
Stop being so superior.
Why shouldn't I take advantage of her?
I want to live.
If you had to step on someone for something you wanted... would you think twice about it?
In a pig's eye.
You're no different from me.
Shut up!
Not till I tell something, you cheap badge pusher.
When we started on this safari, you made it clear...
I was just a job with no joy in it, remember?
Yeah, it still goes. Double.
Okay, keep it that way. I don't care whether you dreamed up this gag or not.
You're going right along with it, so don't go soft on me.
Once you handed out a line about poor Forbes getting killed... because it was his duty.
Well, it's your duty, too, even if this dame gets murdered.
- You make me sick to my stomach.
- Well, use your own sink.
And let me know when the target practice starts.
Get up.
Okay. What's the muscle for?
You broke a tooth.
- You want to try for none?
- No, thanks.
Let's cut a couple of corners, then.
Who's the fat guy?
- I wouldn't know.
- And Densel?
- What's he got to do with it?
- Never heard of him.
Do you hear any better now?
All right, copper, I'm not in this alone, but you are.
You're just one guy bucking a big company.
Don't matter if you beat my brains out or not. We're in business for keeps.
So am I. So talk straight.
The payoff list and the little lady with the boy.
Calls herself Mrs. Sinclair.
That straight enough for you?
You're off your stick, way off.
- Her name's Neall, but that doesn't matter.
- It matters plenty.
Why don't you get wise yourself and give her a break?
What's the use of making that kid an orphan?
Maybe you like trouble.
I love it. So get to the point.
Give us the list and nobody gets hurt.
No grief, no mess.
Except for Mrs. Neall, who gets double-crossed 10 minutes later.
What am I? A jumbo-sized sucker?
That list is no good while she can talk, so make some sense.
- You're not going to do business with us.
- No.
Trying to up the price?
- I don't fix.
- Yeah, we'll get her anyway.
You'll get nobody.
Neither the right Mrs. Neall nor the wrong Mrs. Neall.
You'll get nobody. Do you understand?
- Where is Densel?
- Never heard of him.
All right, talk.
- You can't beat it out of me.
- Talk.
They'd kill me.
Look at me.
If anything happens to her,
I'll find you even if you're in jail... and I'll kill you.
You're under arrest.
This ain't your territory.
What's the charge?
Soiling towels, for one.
Put your hands behind your head and face that window.
- What's going on here?
- I'm an officer making a pinch.
Mr. Jennings, will you step in here a moment, please?
This man claims he's an officer.
- I'll take over, conductor.
- On what authority?
Special agent for the railroad.
We'll handle this.
There won't be any trouble.
All right. I'll wire Albuquerque.
Your credentials won't be necessary.
I checked on you last night.
- What do we book this man on?
- Take your choice.
Attempted bribe, resisting an officer, concealed weapon.
I want him held in technical custody until the next stop.
Also pick up his partner, Vincent Yost.
He's somewhere on board.
The pleasure's all mine.
You can take your hands down now.
There'll be a report to make.
Where do I find you?
Up front, baggage car.
I should've tumbled to you before this.
Flashing that big railroad watch and talking like a timetable.
Walk ahead of me real close and everybody'll think we're old friends.
It's a big company, copper, with branches all over. Don't forget that.
One moment, madam.
Don't move, mister.
Get his keys.
Had about given you up.
I didn't see you get on back there.
Nobody else did, either. You're lucky.
Brown threw the hook.
He ain't on the take.
Who needs him? I'm here now.
- You tell Yost?
- I put him off at La Junta.
Take care of him.
I got nicked in the shoulder.
You look pretty.
What have you been doing?
Falling off the train?
Yeah, off and on.
I just tangled with one of your chums.
The one who thinks the other girl is you.
He's cooling off in the baggage car with a pair of handcuffs.
What was his top bid?
- Whose?
- Don't play dumb with me, Brown.
You want that list because you've got a cash customer for it.
- That hood, am I right?
- You're a good judge of crooks.
The only place you slip up is with cops.
I turned the deal down.
Then you're a bigger idiot than I thought.
Get it through your square head that this is big business...
- and we're in the middle.
- So you'd like to sell out.
With pleasure and profit, and so would you.
What are the odds if we don't?
I sing my song to the grand jury... and spend the rest of my life dodging bullets if I'm lucky... while you grow old and gray on the police force.
Wake up, Brown.
This train's headed straight for the cemetery.
There's another one coming along, the gravy train. Let's get on it.
I'd like to give you the same answer
I gave that hood... but it would mean stepping on your face.
Are you trying to say it's no deal?
I just said it without the trimmings.
If you want those, keep talking.
Mr. Brown, you haven't seen Mr. Jennings, have you?
- No. What's wrong?
- The crew hasn't, either.
He's not up front. No sign of his prisoner.
Well, this rattler hasn't stopped.
They're still on it.
We picked up four at La Junta.
Two sections and one compartment.
That compartment interests me.
But you'd better go through the entire train.
- You see that car?
- Yeah. He's really moving.
He's been with us for some time.
I want you to give a message to the highway patrol.
Tell them where we are and have them intercept that car.
I'll be right with you.
I want a word with Mrs. Sinclair.
Drop this off at Cerillo.
Won't you come in?
- If you can spare a minute.
- Of course.
You have a choice of one chair.
Thanks. I'll have to borrow a cigarette.
I seem to be out of everything.
Everything except the jitters.
I see they're back again.
Maybe this secret you're carrying is a little too much for you.
It's the secret I came to talk to you about.
I feel like I'm intruding on your conspiracy.
After all, whatever this is, it's between you and Tommy.
Not quite. You're in it, too, and I wish you weren't.
- I think you're serious.
- I am.
You've heard of innocent bystanders being hit by a car or bullet... when it was none of their affair?
This is one of those.
You're an innocent bystander.
But nothing's hit me.
Or is it you're afraid something will?
Yeah, that's the general idea.
- And it might be a bullet?
- It could be anything.
You've been mistaken for somebody else and that somebody isn't popular.
Nothing will happen to you...
'cause in a way this is my fault, and I'll see that it doesn't.
I just want to put you on your guard.
It'll work out all right.
I'm not so sure.
Would it help if I told you I'm a detective and this is routine for me?
It would help if you told me the truth,
Mr. Brown, which you haven't.
You're right.
It wasn't easy telling you this much.
Hello, Tommy.
- Are you going to tell her our secret?
- I may have to, son.
Little boys have big ears, and he has a long memory.
We can trust your mother.
Shall we try her out?
Okay.
- Darling, it's bedtime. Excuse me.
- Surely.
If you need me, just knock on the door.
All right, Tommy. I won't let you down.
Sleep tight.
- Is this the cop's compartment?
- Yeah, but I already looked there.
That was yesterday. I still want that list.
I thought you said no one was in there.
- Who is it?
- It's Brown. Let me in.
Like fun it is.
You've got a nerve barging in like this. What...
- Where do you think you're going?
- Stay there and don't make any noise.
All right, boys,
I guess it's time for a showdown.
So before you make any mistakes let me...
She's been here all the time.
That cop was too smart.
- You're mixed up.
- Who asked you?
- I got my lines crossed.
- Where's that payoff list?
That's what I've been trying to tell you.
I haven't got...
Hurry up, tell us.
Go ahead, break it off.
- You won't get what you're looking for.
- Why not?
Tell this muzzler to let go of me and I'll show you.
You had it all figured out, didn't you?
Well, you're wrong.
- I went through the cop's stuff.
- Go through it again.
We don't want to miss any bets.
- Is that it?
- Yeah. Holding his own, too.
- Tommy says good night.
- Thanks.
I guess I'd better level with you.
I've got an important witness, and she's got a lot of enemies.
You wouldn't have heard of her.
She was married to a gangster who was killed, Frankie Neall.
Yes, I've heard of her.
- Just trust me, will you?
- Why should I?
What would you say if I told you that I'm Mrs. Neall?
- You're what?
- I'm Frank Neall's widow, Mr. Brown.
Now do you see what you've done?
You couldn't be. The DA would've told me.
Well, obviously he didn't.
He told me to get to the Coast and not to attract any attention.
It hasn't worked out that way.
Who have I got back there in that compartment?
A policewoman from...
I think they call it Internal Affairs Division.
I've been played for a sucker. Why?
- Why did they stick me with a decoy?
- They've been testing you.
There's a grand jury investigation of graft and payoffs, remember?
I never took a bribe in my life.
Maybe your price was never met.
It never was and never could be.
I don't say I've never been tempted.
Of course I've been tempted.
I'm human like anybody else.
To spend the rest of my time worrying when I'll be caught up with... by some hoodlum holding a first mortgage on my life... payable on demand?
No. No kind of money is worth that.
My record's clean.
The Internal Affairs Division knows it.
Maybe with the way things are, they can never be sure.
When I married Frankie Neall,
I was pretty sure of him, too.
Then I found out how he made his money and I left him.
I only saw him once again before he was killed.
The payoff list was in his things.
You better let me have it.
I couldn't if I wanted to.
I mailed it to the District Attorney.
It's a funny thing.
I once asked my partner, Forbes... what kind of a woman would marry a gangster.
He said all kinds.
I didn't believe him then, but he was right.
- Who is it?
- The conductor.
May I see you a moment, Mr. Brown?
- Privately, if I can.
- Okay.
Don't worry, I'll get you there.
Keep the door locked.
What do you know?
I was right the first time.
Policewoman, huh?
My apologies to you both.
Let's get the real Mrs. Neall. Where is she?
Up front. A pair of rooms, C and D.
Button this up fast.
I heard what happened.
Who was the second guy?
I don't know. He didn't leave his calling card, only that coat.
That's his calling card.
Let me have your gun.
This is it.
All right, I'll handle this. You go ahead.
- Tommy, what is it?
- It's all right. I know who it is.
- What are you doing? Let him go.
- Let me go!
- Better open it, Mrs. Neall.
- Let me go!
- Tommy!
- Don't open it, Mother. He's got a gun.
Hurry up. It's your kid.
- Where's that list?
- He's a real train robber.
Open this door or we'll open it and come in shooting.
The keys.
Listen, copper.
The first door that opens,
I'll put a bullet through this dame's head.
Give me the list, Mrs. Neall, and I might give you a break.
Douse those lights.
Ann, listen to me.
He knows that you've got that list.
You're in a tough spot.
There's no use holding out on him.
The cop's right. Come on, hand it over.
Just play ball with him. Do as he tells you.
All right. I'll get it for you.
Stop stalling.
Ann, we can't help you.
Don't stall him. Give him the list.
- In the medicine cabinet.
- Medicine cabinet.
You all right?
- Mom!
- Tommy!
Take over here.
Come on.
There's the car, boys!
We're looking for a Mrs. Neall.
- Is this her car?
- I wouldn't know.
She's with a cop named Brown.
Where are they?
- Sorry, I can't answer that.
- It's all right. He's expecting us.
Well, they're on to us.
- Reporters?
- The works. Cameras, too.
- How do we beat this rap?
- By size alone. This way.
Take Tommy with you, Mrs. Troll.
I'll meet you at the hotel.
- Yes, Miss Ann.
- Goodbye, darling. I'll see you later.
Can you get away from them?
I don't know. They're on the warpath.
It's up to the big chief here.
I'll go first, Brown.
The rest is your department.
Good luck, and take care of yourself, Mrs. Neall.
That's my department, too. Much obliged.
Thanks, Mr. Jennings.
Well, here we go.
- What about the payoff list?
- All we want is a statement.
It'll take a minute.
- Come, Mrs. Neall.
- Give us a break.
- What will you tell the grand jury?
- Come on, Mrs. Neall. Let's go.
Gangway, boys, you're blocking traffic.
Come on. Gangway.
Come on. Gangway, boys.
What're you trying to do, keep an elephant out of a job?
Keep going.
- All right, boys, let's go.
- Come on, boys. Let's go.
Like I always say, nobody loves a fat man.
Hello, Allen. Everything under control?
I've got a car waiting, the DA's waiting, and a big crowd out front.
We'll get you out the side way.
They won't see you.
But they'll have to see me sometime.
I can't keep running and hiding all my life.
Right now, I think it's a safe idea.
No. Right now is a good time to stop.
- Where is it we're going?
- Hall of Justice, a couple of blocks.
Then these gentlemen will have to excuse us.
We're going to walk.
You heard what the lady said, boys.
Your attention, please.
The Forty-Niner,
Central Pacific train number 8...
eastbound for Albuquerque...
... La Junta, Kansas City, and Chicago,
now ready for...
English
Gentlemen, I wanna welcome you medical schoolmen...
...to our new operating theater.
Although, as you can see, it isn't exactly what you'd call new.
Used to be a library when this was a school...
...and maybe before that some kind of a sugar warehouse.
But makeshift or not, the important thing is that we got it.
The first to be devoted to psychosurgery in this state.
And that is a great step forward.
Now you're going to witness an operation...
...never performed before in this state.
A lobotomy on the brain of a woman...
...suffering from acute schizophrenic withdrawal.
Our new staff member,
Dr. John Cukrowicz from Chicago...
...will perform this operation.
Swab.
Sew up, will you?
You have just witnessed a delicate operation on the human brain...
...performed under the most primitive surgical conditions...
...that I hope any of you will ever encounter.
Excuse us, please.
-Son, I know just how you feel.
-For six months...
...I have listened to you promise me this and that.
-But I am not...
-I know, I know, I know.
You are not the state board of health.
Well, I am not a witch doctor.
I need properly trained assistants.
I need an operating room that doesn't fall apart.
At least lights that stay lit.
I know, but this is a state hospital...
...and there isn't enough money for us.
I can't promise you that there ever will be enough.
I'll go back to Chicago or someplace where there is.
John.
Before you do that...
...read this.
Who is Violet Venable?
You reveal your ignorance of our fair city...
...of which Mrs. Venable is the richest lady.
At one time, her husband owned most of it.
Now she's a widow and she owns it.
"...and was very interested in the work of your Dr. Cukrowicz."
She must have read your write-up in the Herald.
"And I wonder if the foundation
I am establishing...
...might be of some assistance."
Son, with one signature on one check...
...she can solve all the problems we got.
"Also there is a matter of some urgency...
...I should like to discuss with him.
Would 4:30 on Tuesday be convenient?"
That's today.
What is her urgency, do you know?
No, but I know what ours is.
Lack of money. Her money.
She is serious?
4:30 this afternoon, you'll know.
I can tell you this much.
I've been trying for years just to see the Venable lawyers.
You've been invited by her.
That's a command performance.
That's how serious I think it is.
And this is serious too.
More than 1 200 mental cases
Lions View can't afford to handle.
Good afternoon.
-Dr. Cukrowicz.
-Yes, sir.
Take a seat, please.
Thank you.
Mrs. Venable?
I am Miss Foxhill,
Mrs. Venable's secretary.
And you are Dr. Cukrowicz?
Your appointment was for...?
Four-thirty.
You are 23 seconds early.
Sit down, please.
Thank you.
Sebastian always said,
"Mother, when you descend...
...it's like the goddess from the machine."
-Mrs. Venable's on her way down.
-I feel just like an angel...
...coming to earth as I float, float into view.
Sebastian...
...my son, Sebastian, was very interested in the Byzantine.
Are you interested in the Byzantine, Dr...?
Cukrowicz.
I don't know very much about the Byzantine.
The emperor of Byzantium, when he received people in audience...
...had a throne which, during the conversation...
...would rise mysteriously in the air...
...to the consternation of the visitors.
But as we are living in a democracy,
I reverse the procedure.
I don't rise. I come down.
How do you do, Dr....?
Oh, I'm sorry, your name?
Cukrowicz.
It's a Polish word meaning "sugar."
Am I only wearing one earring?
Have I forgotten my lip rouge?
Excuse me, I...
I guess I had been told you were a widow.
I am. I'm in mourning.
White was my son's favorite color.
Perhaps, Dr. Sugar...
...you expected an old widow.
With a garnet brooch, a cane and an ear trumpet.
Well, I have all that to look forward to.
Life is a thief. Sebastian always said, "Life steals everything."
I want to show you his garden.
Are you sure you should go out,
Mrs. Venable?
Quite sure.
They treat me like an invalid.
You see, last spring I had a slight...
...a tiny convulsion of a tiny blood vessel.
What did your doctor call it?
A malady of living.
After all, I've buried a husband and a son. I'm a widow and a...
Funny, there's no word.
Lose your parents, you're an orphan.
Lose your only son and you are...
...nothing.
Foxhill.
Where are they?
I put them in the patio.
They sent them parcel post from
Pensacola. That's why they were late.
Another day and we'd have starved to death. Come on, doctor.
In your letter, you said an "urgent" matter.
I must say, you're handsomer than your photograph in the paper...
...without that awful paraphernalia you doctors wear.
Your son's favorite color, white.
Such extraordinary eyes.
So like his.
You must...
I almost said, "You must meet my son, Sebastian." Force of habit.
Is he the son who died?
Yes, last July, in Europe.
He must have been young to die.
All poets...
...whatever age they may seem to others, die young.
It's unexpected.
Like the dawn of Creation.
It was Sebastian's idea.
Part of his lifelong war against the herbaceous border.
Not unlike a well-groomed jungle and, frankly, a little terrifying.
So was Creation.
So is Creation.
Listen to them buzz, buzz.
What's in there?
This way, before our poor Lady dies of hunger.
The Latin names to the plants are printed on tags...
...attached to them, but the print's fading.
Those ones there are the oldest plants on earth.
Survivors from the age of the giant fern forest.
And here's my poor Lady.
They never get away.
The Lady exudes this marvelous perfume...
...which attracts them.
They plunge into her chalice.
And they never come out.
This operation you perform is called...?
Lobotomy.
-That's an unusual...
-I hate these flies.
Foxhill!
Foxhill!
She loves feeding our wicked Lady.
Foxhill's rather a brute.
Such an extravagance, really, from early fall to late spring...
...Lady must be kept under glass...
...we have to provide her with flies flown in at great expense.
Foxhill, you do the honors.
-Lady's very hungry today.
-Of course, Mrs. Venable.
I've never seen an insectivorous plant before. What is it called?
The Venus's-flytrap.
A devouring organism...
...aptly named for the goddess of love.
What was your son's work?
I mean, aside from this garden.
As many times as I've had to answer that question...
...it still shocks me a little to realize...
...that Sebastian Venable the poet was quite unknown...
...outside of a small coterie of friends, including his mother.
Your son was a poet?
Strictly speaking, his life was his occupation.
Yes. Yes, Sebastian was a poet.
That's what I meant when I said his life was his work.
Because the work of a poet is the life of a poet. And vice versa.
I mean, you can't separate them.
I mean, a poet's life is his work.
And his work is his life, in a special sense.
-Are you all right?
-Right as rain, however right that is.
This operation of yours, does it really work?
Yes, yes, it does.
However, it is very experimental.
I was struck by something you said in the paper.
About the sharp knife in the mind.
That kills the devil in the soul?
I'm afraid I got a bit carried away.
No, what you said was almost poetic itself.
Mrs. Venable, the work of a doctor is his life too.
But we need help, particularly in a field as experimental as mine.
Particularly at a state hospital like Lions View.
Yet we have little money, practically none.
Yes, I know.
Doctor...
...I have a niece by marriage...
...at a place called St. Mary's.
I've heard of it.
It's a custodial home for the insane.
She suffers from something called dementia praecox.
Dementia praecox?
Which is to say, she's mad as a hatter, poor child.
Would you like to see Sebastian's studio?
It's at the end of the jungle in what used to be the garçonnière.
That's an old
New Orleans convenience.
A place where the young men could go to be private.
You're not from New Orleans?
No, Chicago. Actually, dementia praecox is a meaningless phrase...
Chicago. I've always wanted to see two places before I die.
Hong Kong...
...and Chicago.
Now I shall never see either.
Because I must use every inch and ounce of what little strength I have...
...in doing just what I'm doing.
The foundation you referred to?
Building a memorial to my son.
You see, Sebastian had no public name as a poet.
He didn't want one.
He refused to have one.
He abhorred the false values that come from being publicly known...
...from fame, from personal exploitation.
He'd say to me, "Violet, Mother, you're going to live longer than me.
When I'm gone, it will be yours to do whatever you please with."
Meaning, of course, his future recognition.
-You're very like him, doctor.
-ln what way?
Because you, a doctor, a surgeon...
...are dedicated to your art.
Yes, to your art.
It is an art, what you do.
Using people the way he did.
Grandly, creatively.
Almost like God.
I'm afraid my art is to help.
Not to use, but to be used.
Well, it comes to the same, doesn't it?
I mean, in the end.
Oh, I don't know what I mean.
There is the atelier,
Sebastian's studio.
Most people's lives...
...what are they but trails of debris?
Each day more debris, more debris.
Long, long trails of debris...
...with nothing to clean it all up but, finally, death.
I guess...
...quiet desperation is the word for most lives.
But ours were different.
Sebastian's and mine.
I know it sounds hopelessly vain to say...
...but we were a famous couple.
People didn't speak of
Sebastian and his mother...
...or Mrs. Venable and her son.
They said Sebastian and Violet.
Violet and Sebastian are staying at the Lido.
They're at the Ritz.
And every appearance, every time we appeared...
...attention was centered on us.
Everyone else eclipsed.
My son, Sebastian...
...and I...
...constructed our days.
Each day, we would carve each day like a piece of sculpture.
We left behind us a trail of days...
...like a gallery of sculpture...
...until suddenly, last summer...
Your son died?
You say that your niece suffers from dementia praecox.
There must have been a more exact diagnosis.
Such a pretty name for a disease.
Sounds like a rare flower, doesn't it?
Night-blooming dementia praecox.
What form does her disturbance take?
Madness.
Obsession, memory.
She lacerates herself with memory.
Memory of what?
Visions, hallucinations.
It all started last summer.
The first I knew, there was a cable...
...from this clinic in Paris...
...saying, "Your niece is out of her mind. What shall we do?"
I was almost out of my own mind last summer.
Sebastian had just died, I was ill, but I did everything I could.
I said, "Send her straight home with a nurse."
So they put her on the Berengaria...
...locked in her stateroom like a wild animal.
She was taken straight to St. Mary's.
And now they can't keep her there, they can't help her...
...or cope with her fits of violence.
Her babbling, her dreadful obscene babbling.
-What kind of babbling?
-Fantastic delusions and babblings...
...of an unspeakable nature...
...mostly taking the form of hideous attacks...
...on the moral character of my son, Sebastian.
And now they tell me at St. Mary's...
...the mother superior tells me...
...that we must find another place for her.
And then I read about you...
...about your operation, and I thought:
"This may be the answer to all our prayers."
You must realize the operation I do...
...is only for the unapproachable, for the hopeless.
If she isn't unapproachable and hopeless, I don't know who is.
-The things she says.
-What?
-Terrible, obscene things.
-Such as?
Oh, anything.
Such as?
All right, you asked.
This happened recently at St. Mary's.
Catherine accused an elderly gardener of making love to her.
They questioned the gardener, an old man.
It was the other way around.
Catherine had made advances to him, spoken obscenely to him.
When confronted with her lies, she fought, she screamed.
It took four nuns to control her.
And now I'm put on notice that they won't keep her there after this week.
You see why I said urgent.
Yes, I do. I certainly do.
It's important I see her as soon as possible.
And help her because if you can't,
I'm at my wits' end.
I can transfer her to Lions View.
She won't be as comfortable...
I understand, I understand.
But the important thing is you, doctor.
You'll be happy to know that at this very minute...
...my lawyers are working on the
Sebastian Venable Memorial Foundation...
...to subsidize the work of young people like yourself...
...who are pushing out the frontiers of art and science...
...but have a financial problem.
Mrs. Venable, loving your niece as you do, you must know...
...there's great risk in this operation.
Whenever you enter the brain with a foreign object...
...even a needle-thin knife...
...in the hands of the most skilled surgeon...
...there still is a great deal of risk.
But it does pacify them,
I've read that.
It quiets them down.
It suddenly makes them peaceful.
Yes, that it does do, but...
But what?
Well, it will be years before we know if the immediate benefits...
...of the operation are lasting...
...or just passing or perhaps...
There's a strong possibility that the patient will always be limited.
Relieved of acute anxiety, yes, but limited.
But what a blessing to them, doctor, to be just peaceful.
To be just suddenly peaceful.
After all that horror...
...after those nightmares...
...just to be able to lift up their eyes to a sky...
...not black with savage, devouring birds.
You said a sky filled with savage, devouring birds?
Did I?
How odd. I hadn't thought about all that in years.
Now, why should I suddenly...?
Yes, we saw those birds one summer in the Pacific.
You see, my son,
Sebastian, was looking for...
Looking for what?
Rare, hungry birds.
That isn't what you started to say.
You're too quick for me.
No. I was going to say my son,
Sebastian, was looking for God.
But I stopped myself because I thought you'd think:
"What a pretentious young crackpot."
Which Sebastian was not.
This is something
I've never told anyone before.
Something so strange, so terrible.
Forgive me if I sound quite mad, but it's true all the same.
Sebastian saw the face of God.
I'd like to hear about that.
Yes, yes.
One long ago summer, sitting right here in this garden...
...Sebastian said to me,
"Mother, listen to this."
And he read me
Herman Melville's description...
...of the Encantadas, the Galápagos Islands.
He read me that description and said we had to go there.
And so we did go there that summer...
...on a chartered boat, a four-masted schooner...
...the sort of boat that
Melville would have sailed on.
We saw the Encantadas.
But on the Encantadas we saw something...
...that Melville hadn't written about.
We saw the great sea turtles crawl up out of the sea...
...for their annual egg-laying.
Once a year, the female of the sea turtles...
...crawls up out of the equatorial sea onto the blazing sand beach...
...of a volcanic island to dig a pit in the sand...
...and deposit her eggs there.
It's a long and dreadful thing, the depositing of the eggs in the pits.
And when it's finished...
...the exhausted female turtle crawls...
...back to the sea half-dead.
She never sees her offspring.
But we did.
Sebastian knew exactly when the sea turtle eggs would be hatched...
...and we returned in time for it.
You went back?
In time to witness the hatching of the sea turtles...
...and their desperate flight to the sea.
The narrow beach, the color of caviar, was all in motion...
...but the sky was in motion too, full of flesh-eating birds.
And the noise of the birds...
...their horrible savage cries as they circled...
...over the narrow black beach of the Encantadas...
...while the new-hatched sea turtles scrambled out of their sandpits...
...and started their race to the sea.
Race to the sea?
To escape the flesh-eating birds...
...that made the sky almost as black as the beach.
And I said, "Sebastian, no.
No, it's not like that."
But he made me look.
He made me see that terrible sight.
-What was not like that?
-Life.
I said, "No.
No! That's not true!"
But he said it is.
He said, "Look, Violet.
Look, there on the shore."
And I looked and saw the sand all alive, all alive...
...as the new-hatched sea turtles made their dash to the sea...
...while the birds hovered and swooped to attack...
...and hovered and swooped to attack.
They were diving down on the sea turtles...
...turning them over...
...to expose their soft undersides...
...tearing their undersides open...
...and rending and eating their flesh.
Sebastian guessed that possibly...
...only a hundredth of 1 percent of their number...
...would escape to the sea.
Nature is not created in the image of man's compassion.
Nature is cruel!
Sebastian knew it all along, was born knowing it, but not I.
I said, "No, no, those are only birds, turtles, not us."
I didn't know then it was us.
That we are all of us trapped by this devouring creation.
I couldn't, wouldn't face the horror of the truth...
...even that last day in the Encantadas...
...when Sebastian left me...
...and spent the whole blazing equatorial day...
...in the crow's-nest of the schooner, watching that thing on the beach...
...until it was too dark to see.
And when he came down the rigging, he said, "Well, now I've seen Him."
And he meant God.
Do you believe he saw God?
He saw the whole thing there that day on the beach.
But I was like you. I said no.
I refused to believe...
...until suddenly, last summer,
I learned my son was right.
That what he had shown me in the Encantadas...
...was the horrible...
...the inescapable truth.
Oh, Violet, honey.
You gave me a turn, coming in like that.
Hi, Aunt Vi.
What are you two doing here?
We came for cousin Sebastian's clothes, like you said.
Remember?
So we just kind of let ourselves in.
I must have just got hold of this letter when you frightened me.
Caught on your sleeve probably.
This is Mrs. Holly, the mother of the girl at St. Mary's...
...and that is her son, George.
Apparently, in a weak moment, I said he could have Sebastian's clothes.
You haven't forgotten what you said last week at Elaine Tutweiler's?
Said since I was going off to college...
...I could have his clothes, which were going to waste.
That's right, you said that.
I heard you say that son here could have...
All right, I stand accused of generosity. Now will you please...?
Aunt Violet is generous, so generous to her family, Mr...
I didn't catch your name.
-Dr. Cukrowicz.
-Doctor? Are you a doctor?
-Violet, you're not ill again?
-No, Grace...
Oh, I'm so relieved.
I was afraid you had another of those strokes of yours.
Those hysterical seizures.
I've never had a seizure nor a stroke.
We were discussing your daughter.
Cathy?
My poor lamb, my poor little girl.
Doctor, can you help her?
I'll try to if I can.
Mama, look here! White silk.
"Made in Rome."
Oh, boy. Is this one gonna pick up lipstick?
I said take the clothes, George.
Don't flaunt them in my face.
Why don't you both kindly let yourselves out?
Get the rest of the clothes another time.
It won't take me two seconds to finish up.
It's impossible to believe...
...that Sebastian won't walk through that door again...
...with all those bright young people he used to know.
All laughing and carrying on...
...saying those witty, sophisticated things that were way over my head.
He was such a tease too.
You know, doctor...
...he told me that the piece of lace on this table...
...was made by these blind nuns...
...in Belgium. Imagine!
I thought I'd gone through everything.
Who is that?
-lt's the girl.
-Why, that's my poor angel.
-That's Catherine.
-I wonder why he put it there.
Well, maybe he liked her.
George, take your plunder and get out of here.
-Okay, Aunt Vi.
-This must have been taken last spring.
Cathy's wearing her
Mardi Gras ballgown.
Remember, Vi, how lovely she was?
And you loaned her your fur coat.
I remember everything.
I guess it was not exactly a happy evening.
What did happen?
She was... She is a lovely girl.
And I must say, of all my relations...
...my delightful relations, she was the one most like me.
That's why you've got to save her...
...because madness is the most horrible doom there is on this earth.
Every item here has been inventoried by the insurance people.
I'm sure they'd be upset if anything were missing.
What do you think I am?
On that subject, George, my lips are sealed.
Now, both of you, please go.
-lt's almost 5:00.
-That's right.
Violet always has,
I mean, used to have...
...her 5:00 daiquiri here with Sebastian.
Now I have it here alone.
Well, we must fly now.
I do pray you can help my poor Cathy.
Goodbye, doctor.
Violet, bye now.
Say thank you, George.
Bye, Aunt Violet.
Thanks. Thanks for everything.
Aren't they awful?
Sebastian and I used to speculate...
...on how that family of Neanderthals...
...could have produced a girl as rare as Catherine.
You would have liked Sebastian...
...and he would have been charmed by you.
He wasn't a family or a money snob, but he was a snob, all right.
He was a snob about loveliness and elegance in things...
...about personal charm and physical grace in people.
We had a perfect little troupe...
...of young and beautiful people around us always whenever we traveled.
-May I sit here?
-Sebastian's seat.
-Oh, well...
-No, no, please.
It's a court jester's chair.
A rare one, 500 years old.
Please, sit on it.
Say something funny.
Make me stop wanting to cry.
I'm afraid I'd make a miserable jester.
You see, I get concerned when people stop wanting to cry.
Time for your medicine and your frozen daiquiri.
In that order.
Isn't it nice of the drugstore to keep me alive?
-Thank you.
-Foxhill.
See the Hollys off the premises.
They're apt to remove the silver.
Yes, Mrs. Venable.
He would sit in his chair,
I in mine, at 5:00 every day...
...and we'd have our daiquiris with St. Sebastian brooding above us.
But you stayed here last summer.
Yes, I did. I wasn't well.
He took Catherine with him.
-And he died.
-Of a heart attack.
Was she with him?
She was there with him when he died.
It was that day that she lost her mind.
When will you see her, doctor?
As soon as I can.
What can I tell Dr. Hockstader about your interest in helping us?
Can't it wait until you've met my niece...
...and decided if you think your operation could help her?
Yes, of course it can wait.
Surely there's no connection between...
Aren't we always more interested in something that concerns us personally?
Aren't we, doctor?
I understand.
Please don't bother.
I can find my way out.
Millions of years ago, dinosaurs fed on the leaves of those trees.
They were vegetarian.
That's why they became extinct.
They were just too gentle for their size.
Then the carnivorous creatures, the ones that eat flesh...
...the killers, inherited the earth.
But then they always do, don't they?
Catherine.
It's Sister Felicity, Catherine.
Please get up. You're to come with me.
Catherine.
I'm not being violent, sister.
What are you doing?
Just smoking a cigarette.
No.
You know we're not allowed to smoke at St. Mary's.
Please let me smoke.
-Please.
-Give it here.
Don't be a bully!
Disobedience has to be paid for later.
-All right, I'll pay for it later.
-Now, Catherine.
I'm putting out my hand for it.
-All right then! Take it!
-You burned me!
-I'm sorry...
-You deliberately burned me.
You said to...
You stuck the lighted end of it into my hand.
I'm so sick of being bossed and bullied.
I'm sick of being t...
You saw that, doctor.
Saw her deliberately burn me.
-You better put something on that hand.
-I can't leave her.
-Patients who are classified violent...
-Sister.
Very well, doctor.
I'll wait outside.
Just outside the door.
You know, you're very brave being in the room alone with me.
Do you plan to burn me too?
Oh, much worse.
You see, I'm classified as violent.
I'm apt to attack you physically and then accuse you of rape.
Do you do that sort of thing?
Of course. That's why
I'm in isolation.
I molested an elderly gardener of great virtue.
When he refused my advances,
I denounced him as a lecher.
After that, I was punished.
Was it true?
That I was punished?
Yes.
That you accused him unjustly.
Of course I accused him unjustly.
After all, I'm insane.
It's the sort of thing an insane woman would do.
Besides, haven't you noticed how...
...oddly I've looked at you?
Have you?
How I've been staring at your eyes.
Your beautiful, blue, frightened eyes.
Why are they so frightened?
Do you need help?
Do you want help from me?
I'm making you nervous.
You have every reason to be.
Because now I'm going to attack you. Yes, attack.
But it won't be for your beauty.
No, it's for these cigarettes.
Doctor, let me have one.
Of course. Help yourself.
You are good.
-Who are you?
-I'm a doctor.
-Sent by my aunt?
-Yes.
-Because I didn't respond to treatment.
-So they say.
You have been invited to try your hand at what is clearly a hopeless case.
Is it hopeless?
What do you think?
Where are you from?
Lions View.
The state asylum.
Where they have The Drum.
What you call "The Drum" is not a torture chamber.
It's really a recreation hall.
They'll keep me there forever.
Like an animal in a cage.
She is merciless, isn't she?
Who?
Aunt Violet. Why else do you think I'm here...
...where no one can see me, hear me?
You sound as if you think she hates you.
Doesn't she?
Do you hate her?
What, hate?
No.
I don't understand what hate is.
I don't see how anyone could hate and still be sane.
I really do think I am sane...
...despite considerable evidence to the contrary.
Your aunt, Mrs. Venable...
Can no more help herself than I could.
Help herself? How do you mean?
You see, we all loved Sebastian.
Women, men, children, animal, mineral, vegetable...
Sebastian was a vocation, not a man.
Poor Aunt Vi was hooked from the beginning.
Loved Sebastian from the beginning and nobody else.
She gave up everything for Sebastian.
Even her husband.
What was Mr. Venable like?
Mr. Venable was a good man...
...but dull to the point of genius.
That was Sebastian you just heard talking.
He would've said that, and it wouldn't have sounded cruel.
When I talk like him or when Aunt Vi talks like him, we sound heartless.
And we're not really.
Though we do terrible things.
What do you consider terrible?
Aunt Vi let her husband die because of Sebastian.
Killed him, some people thought.
How, killed him?
One summer, Sebastian decided to give up the torments of this world...
...and become a Buddhist monk.
That was in Tibet in the Himalayas.
He shaved his head, was given a wooden bowl to beg rice with and was happy.
Till Aunt Vi came.
Why? What did she do?
Lived in a hut, even took vows, or whatever women do in such countries.
Anything to be near him, to get to him, to make him come home.
While they were there, word came.
Mr. Venable was dying.
He had to see her.
And she chose to stay?
She chose to let her husband die alone.
If you'd known Sebastian, you'd understand how she had no choice...
...how none of us ever had a choice, once Sebastian had decided we were...
...to be used.
Used?
You mean he used people?
Yes.
Isn't that what love is?
Using people?
And maybe that's what hate is.
Not being able to use people.
-Go on.
-Go on where?
Anywhere.
To the first memory you come to.
My first memory?
It was once at a Mardi Gras ball.
The Mardi Gras ball? Yes?
My very first memory.
It was last spring.
Before last spring, I remember...
...nothing, nothing at all.
It's as if my life began and ended that night.
Tell me about it.
At the ball...
I was taken there by some boy who got too drunk to stand up.
I wanted to go home. My coat was in the cloakroom.
They couldn't find the check for it in his pocket. I said, "Let it go"...
...and started out for a taxi.
Then somebody took my arm and said:
"I'll drive you home."
As we left the hotel, he took off his coat and put it around my shoulders...
...and then I looked at him.
I don't think I'd ever seen him before then, really.
He took me home.
He took me another place first.
Near the Dueling Oaks at the end of Esplanade Street.
We stopped. I asked what for.
He didn't answer.
Just struck a match to light a cigarette...
...and I looked at him, and I knew what for.
I think I got out of the car before he got out of the car, and we...
...walked through the wet grass toward the great misty oaks as if...
...as if somebody were...
...calling for help there.
And after that?
I lost him.
He took me home.
Then he said an awful thing to me. He said:
"We'd better forget it.
My wife's expecting a child."
I just entered the house and sat there thinking a while.
Suddenly, I called a taxi and rushed back to the Roosevelt Hotel ballroom.
The ball was still going on.
I thought I'd gone back to pick up my borrowed coat.
But I hadn't. I hadn't gone back for that at all.
I'd gone back to make a scene on the floor of the ballroom.
I didn't pick up Aunt Violet's old silver fox in the cloakroom.
I rushed right into the ballroom, spotted him on the floor...
...ran up to him and started to...
...beat him in the face and the chest with my fists till...
...cousin Sebastian took me away.
Miss Catherine.
Miss Catherine.
She's here. Miss Catherine's here.
In spirit as well as flesh.
And now you want to play a game.
Look at pictures?
Tell you the first thing that comes into my mind, my poor deranged mind.
All right.
That shadow on the wall.
What does it look like to you?
Like a shadow on a wall.
I thought we were gonna play a game.
All right.
I see forests.
Trees, a girl.
And those trees are the Dueling Oaks...
...and that tormented figure is the girl, Catherine, losing her...
...honor.
I'm trying to make you feel sorry for her.
I hope I am.
I am sorry.
I believe you really are.
Tell me about your cousin Sebastian.
He liked me, so I loved him.
How? I mean, in what way did you love him?
The only way he'd accept.
-I tried to save him, doctor.
-Save him from what?
Completing a sort of image he had of himself as...
...a sort of a sacrifice to...
-...a terrible sort of a...
-God?
Sebastian, who was gentle, kind...
...saw something not gentle, not kind, in the universe.
Something terrible in himself.
What was it?
Can you tell me?
-One day at Cabeza de Lobo...
-Where?
That's where we were last summer.
That's where...
That's where Sebastian died?
Yes.
How did he die?
They say a heart attack, but I don't remember.
I really don't.
You see, afterwards,
I was hysterical, taut.
Said things I don't remember.
That's why I'm here.
Because I say things people don't...
...and then I don't even remember.
Try to remember.
You and Sebastian, last summer...
Try to remember.
The beach was very white.
Oh, how the sun burned.
It was like the eye of God watching us.
Burning, burning.
There was no air that day.
The sun had burned up all the air.
Outside it was like inside a furnace.
-Then they came.
-Who came?
From all parts of the beach.
And that awful noise they made.
The noise of musical instruments all made of tin.
Who is "they"?
And that... That music.
That awful music.
I hear that music!
I still hear it!
It's getting closer and closer!
Sebastian!
-What happened? What happened then?
-I don't remember after that!
Stop that this minute.
Stop that noise.
-Doctor, I must see you at once.
-Get out of here.
Sister, get out and don't come back until I call you.
I can't remember.
-I can't remember!
-lt's all right.
Don't worry, it's all right.
But I have to, I want to!
Then you will.
Will you help me?
-lf you let me.
-Yes.
I shouldn't have done that.
Why not?
It was a friendly kiss, wasn't it?
Maybe it wasn't.
Maybe now you'll think that all those...
...stories about the gardener are true.
Whatever's true, we'll find.
I want you to know that
I can look attractive...
...if I had my hair done and if...
When I'm at Lions View, may I wear a pretty dress?
If you like.
Just imagine, once again to be able to do...
...one thing I'd like.
Come out here, son.
I want you to see something.
Take a good long look.
Tell me, what do you see?
Old tires, tin cans, and a "Drink Nehi" sign.
That's the past you're looking at.
Thanks to a certain young man from Chicago...
...there'll be a new building on that lot...
...devoted to psychosurgery, dedicated to the memory of Sebastian Venable.
I wish I were that optimistic.
I've been working with the lawyers and accountants.
And we're getting, listen to this...
...in big, round, beautiful figures,
$1 million.
-Just like that, no strings attached?
-No strings attached.
She wants you, and nobody else, to do the operation on her niece.
You can't blame her for that.
There isn't anybody better.
Something horrible happened to that girl last summer.
Some dreadful, traumatic experience of some kind.
What?
I don't know.
I haven't found out yet.
And she refuses to allow herself to remember.
She's gonna have to be made to remember it.
Come in.
Excuse me, Dr. Hockstader.
Mrs. Holly and her son are here to see the new patient.
Have them wait in my office, will you?
-How's Miss Catherine?
-She looks lovely.
She had her hair done this morning.
She's wearing her own clothes.
I've never seen clothes like that girl's got. From Paris!
Thank you, Miss Benson.
I'll be along.
But she's a patient. You can't let her wear her own clothes.
I put her in the nurses' wing.
I don't want her in the ward.
The nurses' wing?
I know I'm taking a risk...
...but for a while I don't want her to feel she's a patient.
I want her to feel she's free of restrictions, free of being watched.
This is very unorthodox.
So is insanity.
That's why we're here.
Your whole approach has little to do with neurosurgery.
-For the time being.
-That's what this new building is for.
Dedicated to neurosurgery.
Yes, I know.
Mrs. Venable thinks you're prepared to go ahead with the operation.
Yes, I know.
Cathy's in there?
George, hold me now.
I'm so nervous, I could jump clear out of my skin.
Well, don't, Mama.
Kitten.
Miss Benson, why don't you go to lunch now?
Thank you, doctor.
My poor baby. My angel.
-ln this place.
-lt's all right, Mama. I'm just fine.
Say, you look pretty good,
Cathy, considering.
-So do you, George, considering.
-We wanted to see you...
...but Violet said not while you were at St. Mary's.
The doctors there didn't want anybody to see you, so we didn't.
Oh, my, that's a pretty dress.
When did you get that, honey?
In Paris. Cousin Sebastian bought it for me.
Yeah? I'm wearing one of his suits.
Yes, I recognize it.
Wasn't it sweet of Vi to give George
Sebastian's wardrobe?
Nothing else she could have done with it.
It's the thought behind the deed that matters.
Have you seen Aunt Vi recently?
Yes, we saw her last night.
At her house.
She invited us to a little private supper.
She's had this elevator installed.
-Cutest little thing.
-We got business to talk about.
You know how children are, how critical they are.
What did Aunt Vi say last night?
That you were in extremely capable hands.
And I can tell they are capable too.
Mr. Brossard, the new lawyer we got...
Such a nice man too, a tower of strength...
...in all these awful months since Sebastian's been gone.
It nearly killed Violet.
I know, I was right there.
You didn't see her the way I did, grieving like a madwoman.
I mean, like her heart would break.
He was her whole life.
She worshiped the ground beneath his feet.
When she got this letter from that place with the funny name...
What letter?
From the authorities, I suppose, telling what happened to him at...
What was the name of that place?
Where he passed on?
-Cabeza de Lobo.
-That's it.
-Did you see the letter?
-No.
I guess it told all about how he had this heart attack...
...and how Catherine was...
...not quite herself, poor baby.
I'm myself now.
Aren't l, doctor?
Of course you are.
And don't you worry about what people say.
Nobody in the city knows what you've been through.
Do they, George?
Not a thing.
Nobody even knows you've come back from Europe.
When they question us...
...we just say that you stayed abroad to study something or other.
Can we talk to her alone?
Yes, on a little private family matter.
Just some papers got to be signed.
Some business.
Is that all right with you?
Don't worry. Since I've been allowed to smoke, I've become a perfect lamb.
My little girl was always a perfect lamb.
Thank you.
-Cathy, Sebastian left a will.
-A generous, thoughtful will.
He bequeathed to us, to you and to me,
$50,000 each...
...after taxes are paid.
-Sebastian always was very kind.
-lsn't that the truth?
There is a legal problem.
It's very complicated, but
Mr. Brossard, this new lawyer, is...
-...trying to get it through probate.
-Only it won't go through probate.
-Why not?
-Aunt Vi.
Well, you see, it has to do with you.
With your being ill.
-She doesn't trust me with the money?
-50 grand is chicken feed to Aunt Vi.
-Then what is it?
-When you went off your rocker...
Shut up, Mama. Cathy's not that far gone. Are you, Cathy?
-When I "went off my rocker"?
-Yeah. You said something.
You made up some crazy story about Sebastian.
-When she heard whatever it was...
-Last night...
...not a word would she say except that you babbled.
That was her word for it. You "babbled" some story about Sebastian...
-...and how he lived and...
-Died...
...in a place called Cabeza de Lobo.
What you said gave her a real turn.
When the doctors decided you were crazy, she wanted you to stay at St. Mary's.
Or even right here. This seems such a nice place too.
-With that nice, capable doctor.
-Go on.
Written permission was needed to keep you here.
So that was the point of the private supper.
You've got to understand.
This $1 00,000 is the most important thing ever.
George will have all sorts of advantages now.
Things we couldn't give, since 1 929 killed your father and our nest egg.
Mother, you didn't sign those papers?
-You didn't commit me to Lions View?
-Not yet.
But, Cathy, the way Aunt Vi put it, there was no choice at all.
Mama's got to sign.
Besides, honey, it's not like it was for always.
They say in no time after the little operation...
...you'll be able to...
What "little operation"?
Oh, Cathy! Oh, Cathy!
There's only one "little operation" they perform here.
It's on the brain.
It's called a lobotomy.
You may have heard or read about it. I have.
It's that nice, young doctor's specialty.
In cases of hopeless lunacy...
...he bores holes into the skull and operates on the brain!
Oh, honey, please don't talk about it. Please!
-You can't let them!
-Stop. It's not the end of the world!
-Don't sign.
-They say it don't hurt at all.
-Don't let them!
-No worse than having your tonsils out.
And then, afterwards, you're all right again.
Miss Catherine.
-Those faces!
-Look, for the love of...
-Get her back to her room.
-What are you doing here?
Doctor, we've just come from your office.
-What is all that noise? Is it fire?
-What happened?
I don't know. We were having this little chat about your treatment...
...and all of a sudden, she flew out of the room and down the hall.
I'm sure it's the right thing, what you and Violet are doing.
-lt is the right thing for her.
-Come on.
-We're so grateful to you.
-Come on.
Having you look after her...
Will you get me Dr. Van Vitch?
-Yes.
-Thank you.
I'm sorry they upset you.
Miss Catherine, don't ever run away.
Where will you cut, doctor?
I'm not at all sure that I will.
Where will you cut my brain, doctor?
In front? Or further back?
I suppose I'm to have my head shaved.
It seems like a waste.
I just had my hair fixed this morning.
Then to have it all cut off right after it.
I tell you, it's funny.
You were the one who was going to help me.
Help me!
Don't talk like that.
Why not?
Now I sound insane, don't I?
-Are you trying to?
-No, and I'm not.
You've got to believe me, doctor.
I am not.
Insane is such a meaningless word.
But lobotomy has a precise meaning, hasn't it?
Are you going to operate?
Tell me, please, are you going to?
I don't know yet.
Poor doctor.
I bother you, don't I?
Yes, you do.
Well, I'll try not to anymore.
-Three cc, please.
-Yes, doctor.
Must I take off my pretty dress?
Of course not.
I want to help you.
Trust me.
I want to trust you.
It seems to me that
I need help very much.
-His eyes are so blue.
-Who?
The doctor.
Wonder why he isn't blond.
They usually are with eyes that blue.
-I'm blond.
-Are you?
Funny. We were going to blonds next.
Blonds were next on the menu.
Now you just relax.
Let yourself go.
All last summer, Sebastian was famished for blonds.
Fed up with the dark ones.
Famished for blonds.
The travel brochures he picked up...
...were advertisements of blond, northern countries.
Think he'd already booked us to Stockholm and Copenhagen.
Fed up with the dark ones, famished for the light ones.
That's the way he talked about people, as if they were...
...items on a menu.
That one's delicious-looking.
That one's appetizing.
Or that one is not appetizing.
I think really he was half-starved...
...from living on pills and salads.
You just relax now.
We'll fly north, little bird.
It's what he called me sometimes.
Little bird.
We'll walk under those radiant, cold northern lights.
I've never seen the aurora borealis.
He never saw those northern lights.
Who said, "We're all of us children...
...in a vast kindergarten...
...trying to spell God's name...
...with the wrong alphabet blocks"?
Thank you.
I do want to speak with you...
Oh, this forgetfulness, my greatest failing.
I have a little gift for you, this book.
Thank you.
-Poem of Summer.
-By my son, Sebastian Venable.
That volume contains one poem, as do the others I have at home.
Each with the title Poem of Summer and the date of the summer.
If you like that one,
I'll bring you the others.
He wrote one poem a year?
One for each summer that we traveled together.
The other nine months of the year were only a preparation.
Nine months?
The length of a pregnancy, yes.
I gather the poem was hard to deliver.
Even with me.
Without me, impossible.
Doctor, he wrote no poem last summer.
He died last summer.
Without me, he died.
That was his last summer's poem.
Mrs. Venable, how exactly did your son die?
I told you, heart attack.
Is that what the letter said?
How did Catherine know
I received a letter?
Catherine? She knows very little.
She can't remember.
That's her illness. She was there, but she can't remember.
Mrs. Holly told me.
You've seen her too?
I must say, you have been observing.
There was no letter, only a death certificate.
-I'd like to see that.
-Why?
I think it's important.
I want to know what happened the day your son died.
You shall have it tomorrow.
And tomorrow you shall also have the permission to operate.
And now I'd better go.
I've got lawyers waiting for me.
You'd think giving a building was simple. I must sign papers till I drop.
Not that I'm not used to it.
Sebastian never signed anything.
-He must have suspected...
-Mrs. Venable.
Your son...
What about my son?
What sort of personal life did he have?
He was chaste.
You mean he was celibate?
You don't believe me, do you?
-Do you believe that he never...?
-Never.
As strictly as if he'd taken a vow.
This sounds like vanity...
...but I was actually the only one in his life...
...that satisfied the demands he made of people.
My son would let people go, dismiss them...
...because their attitude toward him was not...
-As pure?
-As pure as my son, Sebastian, demanded.
Would you want to see Catherine?
Is that wise?
It might help me.
But the lawyer.
Surely you've kept the lawyer waiting before.
Yes, I have.
Such a strong, such a persuasive doctor.
She's been under sedation.
She's just coming out of it.
She looks lovely, doesn't she?
Doesn't she?
Where are we going?
His eyes.
This one's eyes are so blue...
...such strange, frightened...
I'm sorry. I must have been dreaming.
Hello, Catherine.
I thought l... We would have seen each other before this.
At St. Mary's they wouldn't let any of us see you.
Mama was here today.
It was today, wasn't it? I lose all track of time with all these shots.
You look very well.
Mama told me how you got her to agree to commit me here...
...and then let them...
She seems disturbed, doctor.
Aunt Violet! I am disturbed.
Don't you think I have every reason to be?
Forcing my mother into signing a paper.
I've never forced anybody to do anything.
Oh, yes, you have.
Always.
And now you're holding
$1 00,000 under...
...Mother and George's poor greedy noses...
...to force her to sign a paper...
...authorizing this doctor...
I see no purpose in remaining here listening to this.
I'll wait for you in that sun room.
Doctor, I wanted to speak to you alone.
She wanted to see you again before you left.
I didn't want to take your place last summer.
Please believe that, Aunt Vi.
But Sebastian insisted. He said...
...you weren't well enough to travel with him.
He couldn't travel alone, so he insisted...
...that I go along with him in your place.
And he died last summer.
Aunt Violet, would you like me to tell you?
You fell in love with Sebastian, didn't you?
I tried to give him what you had always given him:
The tender understanding and love...
My son and I had a rare and wonderful love and trust between us.
A contract, a covenant between us...
-I know about the covenant.
-He broke it when...
...he took her, not me, to travel with him while he created his poem.
Even when I was with him, he would sometimes be frightened.
I'd know when and what of.
I'd reach across a table to him and touch his hands.
Say not a word, just look, and touch his hands with my hand.
Then in the morning, the summer poem would be continued...
...until it was finished.
-I couldn't help him.
-Naturally. He was mine.
I knew how to help him.
You couldn't.
-I tried.
-I'd say, "You will."
All right! I failed him.
I knew that the day we flew down to Cabeza de Lobo from...
...where he'd given off writing his poem.
-Because he had broken our...
-Yes, something had broken.
-That string of pearls old mothers...
-Old?
-...hold their sons by.
-Hold them from death.
No, life! Hold them from life!
What do you know?
You were the destroyer.
-We were life.
-You fed on life.
Both of you. Taking!
People were objects for your pleasure.
That's what you taught each other.
-You were superior to mere mortals.
-We needed no one but one another.
Sebastian only needed you while you were still useful.
-Useful?
-I mean young, able to attract.
She's babbling and lying.
-He left her home because she lost...
-You stole him!
Lost her attraction!
What would attraction have to do with a son and a mother?
I'll tell you.
-Can we stop these lies?
-Yes! Have my brain cut.
This was a mistake.
The mistake was my going with Sebastian.
When he left her home, she had a stroke.
Not a stroke!
A hysterical stroke.
Sebastian left her home like a toy he tired of.
And he took me with him like a new toy.
-On his last voyage.
-Lies.
You see, doctor, we both...
-We were decoys.
-Decoys?
For Sebastian.
He used us as bait!
When she was no longer able to lure the better fish into the net, he let her go.
Bait for what?
What were the better fish?
We procured for him.
She used to do it in the fashionable places they went before last summer.
Sebastian was shy with people.
She wasn't.
Neither was I.
But we both did the same thing for him.
We both made contacts for him.
I can't listen to this obscenity.
Stop her, doctor.
Cut the truth out of my brain.
Is that what you want?
You can't. Not even God can change the truth.
We were nothing but a pair of...
-Doctor!
-lt's the truth!
See how she destroys us with her tongue?
Cut this hideous story out of her brain.
How much are you willing to pay for that?
Get me away from her.
Out of here.
Out of this...
-Nurse, some spirits of ammonia.
-Yes, doctor.
-What happened?
-She fainted.
No. No, she didn't.
Just a little...
...dizziness, that's all.
Dr. Hockstader, would you help me to my car?
I don't think that's a good idea right now.
Whether it is or not,
I'm going home.
Tomorrow, I want that girl operated on.
That decision belongs to the doctor in charge, who is also the surgeon.
I don't want to hear from you until the operation has been performed.
No! No!
Please, no!
-You trying to ruin this hospital?
-You know better than that.
Can you imagine what would happen to us if she'd jumped?
She was frightened. She...
Patients are here because they can't think.
After 24 hours observation...
During which she tried to kill herself, incited the men's day room to a riot...
-She opened that door by mistake.
-While trying to get away.
There was a riot, and she caused it.
Don't invent excuses for her.
And from that Paris clinic...
...delusions that the world was devouring her...
...that she was raped by a man with dueling pistols.
-The Dueling Oaks.
-Here's more of her erotomania.
At St. Mary's, they couldn't keep her. And why?
Because of her obscenity and violence.
She sexually attacked a 60-year-old gardener.
It was the other way around.
She tried to burn one of the sisters with a cigarette.
She was provoked.
I was there, I saw it.
Provoked? Who would provoke a disturbed patient?
You'd be surprised.
And, to top it, she attempts suicide.
Cogent proof of sanity, wouldn't you say?
I need time.
When will you want the operating room?
I said I need more time.
I heard you.
Get me Dr. Glen Kilmer at the Seattle Clinic.
You know I want that building as much as you do.
I'll hold on.
Give me one more day to see if I can break through that block to the truth.
This is a medical emergency.
I want to try something.
I want to try something tomorrow, at Mrs. Venable's.
Why Mrs. Venable's?
I don't know. I feel somehow that in that garden...
...maybe in that jungle, we might find...
Look, you don't want Mrs. Venable giving her money...
...to the Seattle Clinic, do you?
And you don't want anybody to be able to say that we acted hastily...
...or unethically, do you?
Cancel the call.
But be sure you know where
I can find Dr. Kilmer.
Mrs. Venable will be right down.
-The others are here, as you asked.
-Show them into the sun room, please.
Of course, doctor.
Cathy, honey...
Later, Mrs. Holly.
Doctor, I have the things you wanted.
-ln the dining room.
-Oh, thank you.
What's going on here?
Sorry to keep you waiting,
Dr. Cukrowicz.
I had to get those papers you wanted.
I mislay everything.
My son always said,
"Mother, if you..."
What are you two doing here?
And where is Dr. Cukrowicz?
Why, I thought you invited us.
Dr. Cukrowicz asked me to ask them to come.
Of course.
Dr. Hockstader...
...I want you to meet my sister-in-law, Mrs. Ho...
Where is Catherine?
In the sun room.
Could Mrs. Holly and her son wait for us in the garden?
Of course. Foxhill?
I don't know why everybody is being so mysterious.
I brought you some of Sebastian's papers. Odds and ends.
And this, the thing you wanted.
Your son's death certificate?
-This must be painful for you.
-lf you don't read Spanish, I have...
I read Spanish.
Well, I have a translation.
As you see, there was no mystery...
...no matter what the girl said at the time or any other time.
It says the body was somewhat...
...damaged in falling.
Where did he fall?
On the ground. Where else do you fall when you die in the hot sun...
...in the street of some godforsaken village?
Did you see his body?
It was a primitive country.
The coffin came to us sealed.
Sealed?
Were there any rumors?
There were no rumors.
His heart stopped and he fell.
I'll wait in the garden now.
That is where you want me?
Yes, if you will.
Dr. Hockstader...
...let me show you my son's garden.
It's very unusual.
Like the dawn of Creation.
Sebastian's garden.
I can still cry.
Am I dreaming this?
It doesn't seem real.
Would you take off your jacket?
It's time for another injection.
What is it this time?
Something different.
The truth serum?
Yes, except there is no such thing.
As truth?
Or the truth serum?
There is truth, all right.
Somewhere.
Sit down.
And now you want me to start counting backwards from 1 00?
-Do you enjoy counting backwards?
-Oh, I love it. Just love it.
I feel it already.
How funny.
Close your eyes for a minute.
I want you to give me something.
You name it, it's yours.
I want you to give me all your resistance.
Resistance? To what?
To the truth.
Truth is the one thing
I have never resisted.
People think they don't resist it, but they still do.
Sebastian said:
"Truth is at the bottom of a bottomless well."
Why did...?
Open your eyes.
Why did you try to kill yourself?
Isn't that what everybody wants?
Me out of the way?
Mother and George would get their money.
You'd get your building.
Aunt Vi...
Go on.
You know what I think you're trying to do?
I think you're trying to hypnotize me.
You're looking at me so...
...straight.
You're doing something strange to me with your eyes.
Your eyes.
-ls that what you're doing?
-ls that what you feel I'm doing?
I feel...
...peculiar.
It doesn't just have to do with what you gave me.
I'm putting out my hands.
I want you to put your hands into mine and give me all your resistance.
Pass all the resistance from your hands into mine.
Here are my hands...
...but there's no resistance in them.
You'll tell the true story?
Yes, I'll try.
Nothing not spoken.
Everything told exactly?
Everything exactly.
Because I have to.
Can I...?
Can I get up?
Yes, of course, but be careful.
You'll feel a little dizzy.
I can't.
Tell me to.
Then I think I could.
Stand up.
Now I can.
-Oh, I'm dizzy. Help me.
-lt's all right. You're all right.
Hold me.
I've been so lonely.
Let me.
Let me.
I suggest you bring her outside, if you don't mind, doctor.
We'll be right out.
Are you ready?
Hello, Catherine.
Now, Catherine...
...you're going to tell the true story.
Where do I start?
Wherever you think it started.
I think it started...
...the day Sebastian was born in this house.
-Cathy.
-I don't mind.
Let's start later than that.
Why don't we begin with last summer?
Last summer?
Last summer. How did it begin?
It began...
...after the Dueling Oaks.
-Don't tell about that, Cathy...
-Mrs. Holly, don't interrupt.
After that happened...
...the next morning,
I started writing my diary...
...in the third person singular such as:
"She is still living this morning."
Meaning that I was.
"What's next for her? God knows."
I couldn't go out anywhere.
That's true.
She wouldn't leave her room.
Shut up, Mama.
I would write:
"She woke up early this morning.
She had her coffee, dressed...
...went for a brief walk."
-Who did?
-She did.
I did.
From the Esplanade to Canal Street...
...as though being pursued by a pack of Siberian wolves.
Went through all the stop signs.
Couldn't wait for the green signals.
"Where did she think she was going, back to the Dueling Oaks?"
Everything...
...chilly and dim.
But that hot...
...ravenous mouth.
He was a very ordinary married man.
And then?
One morning, cousin Sebastian came in and said, "Get up."
Well, if you're still alive after dying...
...then you're obedient. I got up.
He took me downtown to a place where they take passport photos.
He said, "Mother can't go abroad with me this summer.
You're going to go with me this summer instead of Mother."
-Except that it was her idea, not his.
-Mrs. Venable.
And your cousin?
He helped bring me back to life...
...in Paris, Barcelona, Rome.
All those lovely foreign cities
I'd never seen, we saw together.
And those...
What did he call them?
Those sunshine days...
...where it's always noon, and we cast no shadows.
But then...
But then what?
At Amalfi...
...high above the Mediterranean, in a garden, I took his arm.
You took his arm. Yes?
It seemed like such a natural thing to do, but he pulled away.
How he must have loathed being touched by her.
I only did it to try and show my appreciation for his kindness.
I didn't want to...
There was nothing else.
Anyway...
...it was there in Amalfi...
...suddenly, last summer, that he began to be restless and...
Go on.
He couldn't go on.
He couldn't write his summer poem.
I have his notebook here. See?
Title, "Poem of Summer."
And the date of the summer. 1 937.
And after that, blank pages, blank pages. Nothing but nothing.
A poet's vocation rests on something...
...as fine and thin as the web of a spider.
It's all that holds him out of destruction.
Very few are able to do it alone.
Great help is needed.
I did give it. She didn't.
She's right about that.
I failed him.
I wasn't able to keep the web from breaking.
I saw it breaking, but I couldn't save it.
Now the truth's coming out. Maybe she'll admit what really happened.
What did happen?
How she killed him.
How she murdered him at Cabeza de Lobo. Ask her.
What did really happen?
Suddenly, last summer...
...he wasn't young anymore.
We went to Cabeza de Lobo...
...and suddenly, he switched from the evenings to the beach.
From the evenings to the beach?
I mean, from the evenings to the afternoons.
Suddenly, cousin Sebastian changed to the afternoons in the beach.
What kind of a beach was it?
Was it a public beach?
Yes, public.
It's little statements like that that give her away.
After all I've told you about his fastidiousness, can you accept that...
...Sebastian would go to some dirty, free public beach near a harbor?
Whatever she wants to say,
I want her to say it.
Go on.
I don't want to go on.
Every afternoon, you and your cousin would go to this free public beach?
It wasn't the free one.
The free one was right next to it.
There was a fence between the free beach...
...and the beach that we went to that charged admission.
Did anything happen there that disturbed you?
-Yes.
-What?
He bought me a bathing suit
I didn't want to wear.
I laughed.
I said, "I can't wear that.
Why, it's a scandal to the jaybirds."
What do you mean?
Was this suit immodest?
It was a one-piece bathing suit.
Made of white something.
But the water made it transparent.
I told him I didn't want to swim in it...
...but he just grabbed my hand and dragged me into the water...
...all the way in...
...and I came out looking naked.
Why did he do that?
Do you know why he did that?
Yes.
To attract attention.
Why? Because he thought you were lonely?
Did he think he could shock you out of your depression?
You know why I was doing it.
I told you.
I was procuring for him.
Sebastian was lonely, doctor.
That empty blue jay notebook got bigger and bigger.
So big, it was big and empty...
...like that big, empty, blue sea and sky.
And before long, when the weather was warmer and the beach so crowded...
...he didn't need me anymore for that purpose.
The ones from the free beach climbed over the fence or swam around it.
So now he let me wear a decent dark suit.
I'd go to a faraway end of the beach and write post cards...
...and letters and keep up my third person journal...
...till it was time to meet him outside the bathhouses on the street.
He would come out...
...followed.
Who'd follow him?
The hungry young people that climbed over the fence from the free beach.
He'd pass out tips among them, as if they'd all...
...shined his shoes or called taxis for him.
Each day the crowd got bigger...
...noisier, greedier.
At last, we stopped going out there.
And after that? After you stopped going to the public beach?
Then one day...
...a few days after we'd stopped going out to the beach...
...it was a blazing white day.
Not a blazing hot, blue day, but a blazing hot, white one.
We had a late lunch at a shabby, lonely restaurant by the sea there.
Sebastian was white as the weather.
He had on a white silk suit, a white tie, a white Panama.
And he kept touching his face and his throat here and there...
...with a white silk handkerchief...
...and popping little white pills into his mouth all the time.
I knew he was having a bad time with his heart and that it frightened him.
"Let's go north," he kept on saying.
"I think we've done Cabeza de Lobo.
I think we've done it, don't you?"
I thought we'd done it.
Then there were those children along the beach...
...which was fenced off with wire from the restaurant.
Our table was less than a yard away from the wire fence.
And those children...
There was a band of them.
They looked like a flock of plucked birds...
...and they came darting up to the wire fence...
...as if they'd been blown there by the wind...
...by the hot, white wind from the sea.
They were all calling out,
"Pan! Pan! Pan!"
They were calling for bread?
They made gobbling noises with their mouths...
...stuffing their fists into their mouths and making...
...gobbling noises with frightful grins.
We were sorry we'd come to the place, but it was too late to go.
Why was it too late to go?
I told you. Cousin Sebastian wasn't well.
His eyes looked dazed.
But he said, "Don't look at those little monsters.
Beggars are a social disease in this country.
If you look at them, you'll get sick of the country.
It spoils the whole country for you."
Go on.
Go on.
Go on.
I am going on.
The band of children began to serenade us.
-Began to what?
-Play for us on instruments...
...make music, if you could call it music.
Their instruments were the instruments of percussion, do you know what I mean?
Yes, instruments of percussion, like drums.
As far as I could make out in the white blaze of the sand beach...
...the instruments were tin cans strung together...
...and bits of metal, other bits of metal...
...that had been flattened out and made into...
Into what?
Cymbals, you know?
Yes, brass plates hit together.
That's right.
Tin cans flattened out and clashed together. Cymbals.
The others had other things.
All sorts of things.
Things that they'd made or picked up on the beach to make a sort of noise.
A music made out of noise.
Go on.
I am going on.
Nothing could stop me now.
Your cousin Sebastian, was he entertained by this concert?
-Terrified of it.
-Terrified, why?
I think he recognized some of the musicians.
Some of the boys.
Between childhood and older.
What did he do?
Did he complain to the manager?
What manager? God?
You don't understand my cousin.
How do you mean?
He accepted all as how things are...
...and thought nobody had any right to complain or interfere whatsoever.
Even though he knew what was awful was awful...
...what was wrong was wrong.
He thought it unfitting to ever take any action about anything whatsoever...
...except to go on doing as something in him directed.
What did this something in him direct him to do?
He suddenly pushed himself away from the table and said:
"They've got to stop that.
Make them stop. I'm not a well man.
I have a heart condition.
It's making me sick."
That was the first time that cousin
Sebastian had ever attempted...
...to correct a human situation.
I think that that was his fatal error.
He stalked out of the restaurant after throwing paper money on the table.
He fled from the place.
I followed.
It was all white outside.
White hot. A blazing white hot, it...
You followed Sebastian out of the restaurant onto that hot, white street?
Running along the beach...
-You ran along the beach?
-No, no. We didn't.
We didn't move either way.
I rarely made any suggestion, but this time I did.
What did you suggest?
Cousin Sebastian seemed to be paralyzed near the entrance at the café.
So I said, "Let's go."
I remember I said:
"Down that way is the harbor, and we're more likely to find a taxi near there.
Or why don't we go back in and have them call us a taxi?
Oh, let's do! Let's do that.
That's better."
And he said, "Are you mad?
Go back in that filthy place? Never!
That gang of kids shouted vile things about me to the waiters."
I said, "Well, let's go down towards the harbor.
Let's not try to climb that hill in this dreadful heat."
And cousin Sebastian shouted,
"Please shut up!
Let me handle this situation, will you? I want to handle this thing."
And he started up the steep street with a hand stuck in his jacket...
...where I knew he was having a pain from his palpitations.
But he walked faster and faster in panic.
The faster he walked...
...the louder and the closer it got.
Closer what got?
The music!
The music again?
The music!
The noise of the following band.
They were following.
They were following...
...up the blazing white street.
Up. Straight up. That was the only way open, so he went that way.
He tried to escape from those streets?
He tried to escape from those streets...
But he couldn't find a way out?
He couldn't find a way out.
Did the band of children...?
When he tried to escape...
...from those streets...
...down those little side streets, between the buildings...
...they came from everywhere.
So the only way was up.
The only way was straight up...
...up those steep, white streets...
...in the sun, that was like a great white bone of a giant beast...
...that had caught on fire in the sky.
And Sebastian kept running straight up.
I don't know how he still ran.
He never ran...
...but he ran and he ran and he ran...
...where it was whiter and emptier.
What was emptier?
The light... The sky and the light.
Those steep, white streets and the sun, and everything blazed white and empty.
Where did those streets lead to?
Nowhere!
He never reached...?
He never reached the end.
They stopped nowhere! Never!
Except, except...
Except?
At the very top of the hill.
Something. A place, a ruin.
Broken stones. Like...
Like what?
Like the entrance...
...to a ruined temple...
...some ancient ruined temple...
...which he entered.
And they overtook him.
There in that...
And you, Catherine, what did you do then?
I heard Sebastian scream.
He screamed just once.
Then I...
Help!
Help!
And then? Then?
I ran. They let me run.
They didn't even see me.
Run where?
Down.
The waiters, police, people...
...ran out of buildings, back up to where...
...to where cousin Sebastian...
He was lying naked...
...on the broken stones.
And this you won't believe.
Nobody, nobody could believe it.
It looked as if...
...as if they had devoured him!
As if they had torn or cut...
...parts of him away with their hands...
...or with knives or those jagged tin cans...
...they made music with...
...as if they'd torn bits of him away...
...and stuffed them in their own gobbling mouths!
There wasn't a sound anymore.
There was nothing...
...but Sebastian...
...lying on those stones...
...torn and crushed.
Oh, Cathy.
Mrs. Venable.
There you are.
I thought you were still on deck.
And where's your hat?
Oh, dear, you'll get fever.
A whole day up there in the rigging in the hot sun.
Watching those awful, hungry birds.
I don't know what you see in such terrible sights.
It's too much for both of us, my darling.
That horrible sun.
Of course God is cruel.
We didn't need to come to the
Encantadas to find that out, did we?
No, we've always known about Him.
The savage face He shows to people...
...and the fierce things He shouts.
It's all we ever see or hear of Him now. Nobody seems to know why.
The difference is...
...we know about Him, the others don't.
That's where we're lucky.
Go rest, my darling.
Look out for that fever.
I'm going to see the captain and tell him to change our course for home.
Oh, Sebastian.
What a lovely summer it's been.
Just the two of us.
Sebastian and Violet.
Violet and Sebastian.
Just the way it's always going to be.
Oh, we are lucky, my darling...
...to have one another and need no one else, ever.
There's every possibility that the girl's story is true.
George, tell her she's got to come home with us.
-Catherine'll be all right.
-Can't she come home?
Don't worry, she will.
-Why don't you take your mother.
-Sure. Come on, Ma.
Miss Catherine?
She's here, doctor.
Miss Catherine's here.
What a lovely night, madam.
Yes, that's right.
Aldo Di Parolini, embassy attaché.
- Baroness Mina von Kraft.
- I'd love to dance with you.
Champagne, please.
Dear baroness, your perfume is unforgettable.
Madame First Lady, I drink to your stunning beauty.
Émile, I'm sure you know captain Rudolf von Rath who triumphed at the horse show last Sunday.
Congratulations.
Your emperor must be proud of you.
Mr. Prime Minister is too kind.
I'll see you later, captain.
Wonderful.
You're a very happy man,
Mr. Prime Minister.
As are you, Madame First Lady.
You own a real gem.
Only a sketch, unfortunately.
A very small sketch.
Small but very beautiful.
I prefer the Michelangelo.
- A Michelangelo?
- Yes, my dear.
It's over there.
Is it really a Michelangelo?
Well...
Dear Mathilde, be kind enough to introduce me to his Excellency Lord Bradbury?
Sorry, Paul.
My Lord, allow me to introduce
Mr. Paul Desfontaines, our famous Prefect of Police.
Pleased to meet you.
You're almost as famous in London as in Paris.
You were admiring the Michelangelo?
Yes, but I was also told that you had a Botticelli.
That's right.
Émile found it last winter when visiting an old castle for sale.
The people there didn't know what it was.
Come and see it.
Believe it or not but to get it,
I had to buy the house and its furniture.
It cost next to nothing actually.
If I had bought only the painting, the owners would been suspicious.
Thank you, baroness.
You are delightful.
Say...
Isn't that the famous Lord Bradbury with P.M. Duchamp?
- Where?
- Over there.
- Yes. But don't you know him?
- No.
My dear baroness, you must fill in this gap. May I?
A masterpiece!
A real masterpiece!
We almost bought the same in Florence.
Do you remember?
That's right. But it didn't go well with the modern style of the lounge.
But you could have changed the furniture!
My Lord, may I introduce the baroness
Mina von Kraft who's eager to meet you.
- What a nice name!
- Delighted to meet you.
- May I ask for this waltz?
- Of course!
I love this music.
Madame, your party is wonderful.
May I have this dance?
- Do you know this person?
- Never seen him before.
The maharaja!
Goodness me! I'd forgotten about him.
- Who's that wonderful dancer?
- I was about to ask you.
Will you sing for us tonight?
How do you know that I sing?
I was at the Dangremont's the other night. You were so...
- wonderful.
- You were there?
I remember!
Your dress was the color of the moon.
Ah... You were so beautiful.
The lights have gone out.
- Is this for a surprise?
- It is not.
A gas failure.
Those things happen, you know.
Calm yourselves, please.
The problem will be rectified shortly.
The gas will be restored, this won't last long.
- Who are you?
- Ernest, sir.
What are you doing?
Bring some light. Quick!
Forgive me, Excellency.
We're in the country and gas doesn't work as well as in Paris.
Get more candles!
In the meantime, play something, gentlemen, please.
Anything!
- Candles near the musicians.
- Near the musicians?
- Orders of the P.M.'s wife.
- Very good, sir.
Excuse me, Excellency.
I can't believe it.
Let's dance!
Baptiste, follow me!
Excuse me, Your Highness.
So sorry.
Say...
What do you think it's worth?
These two?
Five or six francs maybe.
- For the two?
- Yeah!
He spent more than that.
That's his problem.
Give me my beautiful paintings.
- You were thirsty, my dear!
- Parched!
- Have you seen Signor Paolini?
- We haven't.
My dear lady, where's your painting?
My painting?
- It isn't here?
- It isn't!
Where is it then?
But I have the majority, my dear.
That doesn't worry me.
- Where must I put this one?
- Put it here.
What worries me or rather what annoys me is something else.
You understand...
I've been robbed.
Mathilde!
Come see! - What?
- Come!
Good God!
What about my Michelangelo?
Extraordinary!
At least my Michelangelo is safe.
My best piece!
They haven't seen this one.
Arsène Lupin!
So sorry,
Mr. Prime Minister.
I wonder why he didn't take this one. but your Michelangelo is a fake.
He is an expert.
Stazione Termine.
Everybody out!
- What?
- What?
Everybody out.
I'll leave you here.
We have to go on on foot?
Precisamente!
You saw that: 27 kms to Paris!
A 27 kms' walk. Can you imagine?
You should have told us, I wouldn't have come. I don't like walking.
I don't like the country.
Boss, yesterday, when you hired us you said we'd do the job in an automobile.
- That's what I liked.
- Nothing was said about coming back.
I promised you 300 francs each,
I'm giving you 500.
That's all right then.
If you need us again, you know where to find us.
- Strange fellow.
- We can't complain. The pay was good.
Yes indeed. But I like to know who I work for.
I prefer it.
Give me a smoke.
I'll take my bath now, Arthur.
Tell Ursule to cook two eggs and ham.
Well done.
I'll expect you tonight in my dressing room after the show.
I'll expect you tonight in my dressing room after the show.
Arthur!
Wind up the gramophone, Arthur.
Here it is.
Now go to Lachaume's, give them that card,
See you tonight, my Nini! and tell them to deliver five dozens roses to the listed address.
But nice roses, with very long stems.
Food is served.
Monsieur should eat while it's warm.
Monsieur!
You must clean up!
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.
I'd like to buy a wedding present.
Sit down, please.
We have lovely things for such events.
- Well, it's for...
- If I may.
It's for my daughter's wedding.
I had thought of a set of jewels.
A little diamond necklace.
A bracelet.
And a tiara too maybe.
Mr. Cléricy.
Good morning, sir.
This gentleman would like to buy some jewels for her daughter's wedding.
May I ask you, with respect, how much money you intend to invest in the wedding presents of miss...?
Colette Gilet.
I am Raoul Gilet, wine-grower at Pessac near Bordeaux.
I am a widower and next month
I'll marry my daughter, my only child, to Mr. Pierre Bauchard, the son of my neighbor who's also my main trade rival.
Cléricy, one of this House's partners.
Allow me, Mr. Gilet, to congratulate you for this coming wedding which will most certainly make your daughter happy.
Well, I think we had better show you several sorts of jewels, as chance inspires us.
That way, we'll have an idea of what your wishes might be.
May I leave you for a short while?
I apologize for my indiscretion but I suppose Miss Gilet has come with you to Paris.
- Of course!
- Don't you think that to ask her about the choice that you are about to make.
It might be wise indeed.
In front of the young lady, we won't mention prices.
It's not necessary as we know the kind of jewels you intend to buy and the amount of money you plan on spending.
Well, in that case, I'll be glad to accept what you suggested.
I'll ask you though to be kind enough to come to my hotel this afternoon
- because my daughter can't leave.
- Most certainly.
She's expecting a few suppliers, milliner, linen seller...
I do understand.
Miss Gilet must be very busy getting her trousseau ready.
I'd be pleased to oblige.
Great!
We're staying at the Hotel Meurice.
- Very well.
- It's now 4 minutes after 12
Time for a quick lunch.
Let's say 3 o'clock, shall we?
We shall be there at 3 o'clock.
Let me thank you for the trust you have kindly shown for our House.
I am sure that you won't regret it.
I'm sure I won't.
Goodbye, sir.
They promised that all my dresses would be ready at 12 sharp.
There are several bags of course.
Very well, Baroness.
You wrote down the address:
18, avenue de l'Opéra?
- Yes, Baroness.
- Thank you.
- Here you are, at last!
- We're sorry.
- Where shall we have lunch?
- At the Café de Paris.
The Café de Paris again!
You haven't got much imagination.
Paris still attracts many foreign visitors.
We certainly don't complain.
Of course! Now, I have an appointment later with two gentlemen from Berthier, the jeweler's store.
They will be here at 3.
- Will you show them up when they arrive?
- Understood, sir.
Thank you.
- Concierge, please.
- Gentlemen.
Could you have us shown to Mr. Gilet's apartment, please?
We have a 3 o'clock appointment.
Mr. Gilet told me you were coming.
Show these gentlemen to apartment 45.
This way, please.
Tell me, my child: how old are you?
- I'm 22, sir.
- Twenty-two!
You don't look it yet.
And how long have you been practicing your profession?
- For three years, sir.
- Three years!
Very good, very good.
Come in!
Sir, two gentlemen want to see you.
Very well. Have them wait in the sitting-room.
Very good, sir.
- I hate having visitors.
- Really?
Yes, really.
Miss, you're going to do me a little favor.
I'm at your disposal, sir.
You see this clock?
It's one minute after three.
At five past three, not later, you'll knock at the door there, it opens into the sitting room.
You will open it, without waiting for an answer, and you will see me there with two gentlemen.
I'll ask you with a frown and you, without saying a word, no use speaking, lying, isn't it?
You'll make a sign with your finger.
Like so.
- Like this?
- That's it, my child.
Then you'll shut the door.
The rest is up to me.
Those gentlemen will understand that I'm busy.
That's all I want from you.
At five past three, all right?
Hello.
Welcome. You're right on time.
It's a good quality.
Especially in business.
My daughter is next door, with the manager of a linen shop.
- I'll go get her in a short while.
- No need to rush things.
We're in no hurry.
Here is the tiara.
Its price is 115,000.
If I may, I'll recommend it because of the exceptional quality of the stones.
The main piece, the emerald, is a collector's item.
The bracelets.
And now the necklaces.
You'll notice that supple and light setting, the design of which is our exclusive property.
It's an original creation which few people can say they've seen, as we made the first one for the Archduchess Sophie.
For her recent wedding.
This is the second one made in our workshop.
We finished it the day before yesterday.
That's all!
- I must say I'm a quandary.
- Please...
My daughter seems to need help choosing.
She's still a child.
She always needs my advice.
I'll help in those frivolous matters and then I'll call you.
Very good, my dear child, you were very good.
Thanks to you, my visitors understood that I was busy.
That's what I wanted.
You can leave now.
Goodbye, miss.
Thank you very much.
If the daughter is as quick to decide as her father, it'll take time.
But...
You're crazy, my friend.
Shut that down at once and sit down.
I've had transactions fail for less than that.
Mickey, you must obey your mum.
Take off you roller skates.
You must excuse him, sir.
Our boys are the most ill-bred in the world.
Maybe, but their mothers are the prettiest.
It's intolerable.
You've understood?
Arsène Lupin!
In a hurry to choose,
I'll take all of them and ask you to send the bill to your insurance: Mr Lloyd in London.
Do you know that you're in trouble, miss?
I, sir! I fail to see what I can be reproached with.
Accessory to a fraud.
Quite simply!
What about the hotel management then?
If you say I'm an accessory, they're more so than I am.
Since they rented out the apartment.
And that's why the thief succeeded.
You don't seem to like your employers.
- No.
- They fired her immediately.
And I wonder why.
What have I done?
You've been much more obliging than a manicurist has to be.
I?
I only did what the management requires.
How so?
We're asked to do our best to satisfy the customers.
The old man asked for a favor.
I obliged him.
Then they fire me and
I'm arrested by the police.
No!
Don't raise your voice!
- Where do you think you are?
- The police!
This is the prefect of police's office.
And in the presence of the Prime Minister.
Sir, I apologize.
What's your name?
Léontine Chanut.
How old are you?
22, Mr. Prime Minister.
- What do your parents do?
- I'm an orphan.
My father was a civil servant.
He died in the line of duty.
His father was one of us.
Leon Chanut, chief inspector at the Vice Squad.
I knew him well.
Fancy that! And you've been a manicurist for long?
- Three years.
- At the same place?
- Yes, Mr. Prefect.
- Yes, my dear, she is innocent.
It's clear as day! But in the meantime,
Lupin is still at large.
Do something, by Jove!
If good will must be stimulated, tell me, we'll do something.
Look, I'll give a thousand louis to the person who'll help to arrest this thug.
Aren't you afraid of being accused of seeking publicity?
- In your situation.
- You're right.
We'll say that the police offers a 20 000 francs reward for Lupin's capture. All right?
My newspaper will publish a special edition to announce it and we'll write about what happened in the Meurice Hotel.
- With all the details.
- Bravo, Mr. Prime Minister.
Why are you saying this, miss?
Because... I think it's a good idea.
- You do?
- Yes, Mr. Prime Minister.
You can free this young lady, inspector.
No use adding unlawfulness to your incompetence.
Unless you, my dear...?
You're free to go, miss.
Thank you, sir.
Mr. Prime Minister.
Strange little girl.
Yep.
All this doesn't help much.
This is not the right way.
It's the way we came from.
- I hadn't noticed.
- Freedom is this way.
I choose freedom them.
I'll ask the hotel management to take you back.
Thanks but no thanks.
I'd rather starve.
Goodbye, inspector.
As you like.
Goodbye, miss.
- So, you saw something?
- Nothing at all.
I'll go back then.
I was sure that they would not keep you long.
How did you get in?
Through the door.
You've got nerve!
I admit I'm in the wrong.
You admit it! Very nice of you.
But I've lost my job.
And I've spent the night in jail.
Wait!
50 louis.
That's for the night you spent in jail.
And I apologize.
As for your job, go to this address tomorrow morning.
You'll be hired as a manicurist there.
Charles Dogor, at the Palais Royal.
I know the place.
Go there at 9. Show that card.
Give them your name, and they'll hire you right away.
You are recommended by Grand Duke Michel.
The Czar's uncle.
No need to show me out.
I know the way.
Charles Dogor,
Man's hairdresser.
Monsieur...
I'd like to have a word with your new manicurist.
What about, monsieur?
I'm sorry but employees can't receive visitors.
- I won't be a minute.
- Please...
Haircut, shampoo, manicure.
- Is Mr. Blondeau pleased?
- Of course.
Inspector, please don't disturb me while I'm at work.
Calm down, my child.
Tell me...
Does one of these characters bear any resemblance to Lupin?
This one for instance.
No.
That one?
That one?
Mr. Laroche!
How nice to see you!
Your hairdresser is free.
Good!
Shampoo, manicure.
Miss...
I've got a customer, inspector.
- How long will it take?
- 20 minutes at least.
Let go of me, will you!
I'll be back in twenty minutes.
- How are you, Mr. Laroche?
- Hello, Frédéric.
- Well, Laroche!
- Hello!
- Will we see you at Countess Kieffer's?
- Perhaps, perhaps.
Bravo for yesterday.
Your mare won once again.
- Well, a 1000 louis prize!
- You're hard to please.
- Your horses cost you.
- Money's there to be spent.
Nice weather today, isn't it?
How is the famous Laroche feeling?
Quite well.
What about your infamous newspaper?
My infamous paper is well too.
- See you later.
- Quite so.
Monsieur...
Your hand please!
Indeed, miss.
- Excuse me, monsieur.
- Sorry, miss.
Lovely!
Does monsieur think that his horse Mirliflor might win this afternoon at Chantilly?
He won't. The track will be much too dry for him.
Monsieur...
Sorry!
Miss, it's the second time
I've given you my hand.
I should beware, shouldn't I, Frédéric?
Come on, Mr. Laroche, you won't be a bachelor all your life.
Handsome as you are, it would be a pity.
You're right. I'll get married and have many children.
Good morning, Mr. Poirier.
- What's that?
- A rub, monsieur.
- What fragrance?
- Royal fern. A new one.
- You must be crazy.
- Why, monsieur?
How dare you offer me one of your awful perfumes?
What did you do with mine?
Did you drink it?
Sorry, Mr. Laroche.
I had forgotten.
Thank heavens, he didn't drink it all.
Monsieur, your hand please.
This time, my child, it's for life.
You couldn't put it better,
Mr. Lupin.
Look, that's him, Lupin!
I've tied him up.
Lupin, you're done.
- I, Arsène Lupin?
- Yes, you.
You can laugh. It's over!
This is ridiculous! Monsieur is known in Parisian society. He is a millionaire.
You're perfect!
He is perfect.
And you are very good.
I'd never seen you act before but you're remarkable.
I'll tell Gémier about you.
No, Berlustel.
He'll most certainly give you a part.
- But he's a real policeman!
- My dear Charles, you didn't understand.
They didn't tell you because you wouldn't have accepted it.
But look at this gentleman.
He is obviously a professional actor.
He was most certainly paid by someone here, right?
Besides, we'll find that someone.
He is most certainly here.
I want to know who did this.
I'll know who did it.
- He did!
- I?
- You did, Gauthier!
- Never in life!
The joke is obviously a journalist's.
You swine, you did it?
I'll make you pay.
The truth, miss.
He staged that joke, didn't he?
What did you give her in exchange?
Well, what's wrong with her?
Give me some water.
No, a wet towel will be better.
Well?
Thank you!
Help me!
Can't you see she's falling down?
I've got nothing to do with this.
No, please!
Take those off. They're a nuisance.
I can assure you it's not me.
She's feeling better.
Well, miss, where were you?
Come on, Lupin, the show is over.
Come with me.
Stop it, I've had enough.
Who are you anyway?
- Inspector Dufour?
- Yes indeed, pal.
Well that's another story.
Remove these at once, will you!
Did you hear what I said, my friend?
You're making a fool of yourself.
- Everyone in Paris knows him but you.
- Who are you?
Jacques Gautier, editor of
"Le Petit Journal."
So what? A journalist's testimony means nothing.
I'll give you a testimony that you won't forget any time soon.
- Hello, miss...
- I'm listening, monsieur.
Sorry, I was angry.
Can you get me Police Headquarters?
- The police?
- Yes, it's an emergency.
- Hello, Police Headquarters.
- Hello, Police Headquarters?
- Yes Monsieur.
- Can I have the Préfet, please?
- The Préfet?
- Yes, himself. Mr. Paul Desfontaines.
- Don't hang up, sir.
- All right. I'll wait.
I was about to suggest it.
Hello? Paul?
- Himself.
- André speaking.
- Which André?
- André Laroche.
Oh, it's you, André?
- André?
- Yes, André.
- I was just talking about you 5 minutes ago.
- With whom?
With whom?
You're too curious, my dear friend.
Say, did you get home all right yesterday night?
Quite all right. But not alone.
That's why I'm calling you.
Thank you, dear friend, she's lovely.
- Indeed.
- You're quite a good guest.
- You too, dear friend.
- Me too? Of course!
- We're both bachelors, aren't we?
- Indeed.
A good situation, the best! By the way, what are you doing tomorrow night?
- Whatever you like.
- Great, you're the king of préfets.
Why don't you come for supper around midnight? We'll be six.
- Six men?
- Of course not, dear friend.
Only two. You and I.
That's enough, isn't it?
See you tomorrow.
Well, dear fellow, is that convincing enough?
Now if you need more testimonies,
I can also phone the President.
André, you'll give me those ladies' names.
Names! I need names!
- I need a story.
- My cane, my hat!
- Come on, André.
- Leave me alone.
- I won't leave you alone.
- Jacques, you're a real nuisance.
You'll most certainly invite ??? and Miss Folleville
Not on your life!
Besides, I don't even know them.
That's enough. Let me get through.
I want to leave.
- Where are you going?
- Back home.
- Quite the blown lead.
- Inspector, I think that you're a fool.
Wait for us, Inspector!
I'll be watching you.
- I'll follow the policeman.
- And I, the manicurist.
Inspector, you're under arrest.
You're really not funny.
- What do you want?
- I advise you to buy "Le Petit Journal"
- tomorrow morning.
- What for?
You'll be in the headlines.
You'll be glad. You'll see.
Miss...
Miss!
- Why are you running away?
- What do you want, Monsieur?
I haven't tipped you.
Why were you running away?
You were afraid?
- Not as much as you.
- I was afraid?
Not any more. But a while ago, you were afraid.
Why on earth?
Because you are Arsène Lupin.
Miss!
- I read that Monsieur was arrested.
- Yes, I was arrested.
But I am not Arsène Lupin, unfortunately.
It's a pity!
I would have liked it!
Instead of saying foolish things, give me my paper.
A new plague: lupinity .
An awful mistake.
Thinking she recognized Lupin, the Meurice young manicurist 
has a known parisian personality arrested.
Inspector Dufour makes a fool of himself.
My dear friend, you forgot the sugar.
Excuse me, Sire, but I only wanted to know if that young man could understand French.
The hiding place is ready, Sire.
I'd like you to see it.
Mina, you're extraordinary.
If you were in charge of the French police, I'm sure that you'd know how to find that Arsène Lupin.
I might, Sire.
Because I found out who he was
15 minutes ago.
Well really!
What do you mean, my dear?
So who is he?
He is very well known in Paris,
Your Majesty.
And no one knows that this celebrity is also Arsène Lupin.
Today is really your day.
I'm really surprised.
I'm really curious to see this.
Sorry, my dear, but your French perfume is wasted.
I'll have another one bought tomorrow.
Your Majesty is too kind.
This machine is a masterpiece.
I like that hiding place, Mina.
- It will be very useful.
- Really, Sire?
Really very useful.
Good because I felt that
Your Majesty was not happy with our secret machine.
I apologize but I was thinking of something else.
I was thinking of Arsène Lupin.
You said earlier that you knew him under another name.
- That's right, Sire.
- In that case, do whatever it takes to have him come here.
I'd really like to meet him.
- Really, Sire?
- Really.
I hope this will be possible.
Everything is possible to serve your Majesty.
My dear baroness, you're a remarkable woman.
What would I do without you?
But do things quickly;
I give you carte blanche.
I think only of you yet you're giving me a rough ride.
- You're the man I need.
- I?
- You're leaving for Paris.
- At once?
At once! Come into my office,
I'll tell you.
- You're a real tyrant, my dear.
- Shut up! You annoy me.
- Hello?
- Mr. Laroche, for Mrs. de Fleurville.
I think Monsieur has gone out.
I'll check.
Monsieur, it's Mrs. de Fleurville.
Monsieur has gone out.
- Tell him that I phoned.
- I'll tell him, madame.
- Thank you.
- Goodbye, madam.
- She didn't believe you.
- I don't know, Monsieur.
She seems much interested in Monsieur.
She phones every day.
Many are much interested in me these days.
Far too much, I'd say.
Good morning. Anything to declare?
Nothing.
- There?
- Personal things.
- I apologize.
- Apologies accepted.
Fifteen minutes pass quickly.
What now?
We're changing cars.
I see. Connection time.
Very good.
Auf wiedersehen, gentlemen!
Nice castle!
It's one of the summer mansions of His Majesty the Emperor.
Ah! I see!
Mr. Laroche, you're going to meet our Emperor.
Really? Great!
The person you were waiting for has just arrived, Sire.
I'm delighted, Mina.
But if you'll excuse me...
I hope that your Majesty will at last tell me what he intends to do with that person.
One second!
Good morning, Mr. Laroche.
Look...
Tell me what you think of this horse.
It's a fine horse, Sire.
It's Mandragore's son if I'm not mistaken.
Very good, Mr. Laroche.
You are right, it's a scion of Balthazar and Mandragore.
How did you know?
I saw the mother in a race in Liverpool eight years ago.
But tell me what you think of this young horse, I'm interested.
Well, to speak frankly, Sire, he doesn't look in good shape.
A bit overtrained maybe.
You were right, my dear.
Mr. Laroche knows horses well.
And dance too, your Majesty.
I indeed had the pleasure of waltzing with the baroness at a Parisian party.
Mina told me the story.
The Prime Minister's ball.
The paintings.
I found that quite amusing, monsieur.
Go and get settled in, monsieur.
I'll see you later.
I'm very pleased, my dear.
Your friend has made a good impression on me.
He is not my friend, Sire.
- Your Majesty?
- Yes.
Why did you make him come?
To get to know him, my dear.
You know that.
Permit me to withdraw, Sire.
I'll go ride my mare.
Go, my dear, go.
- Charming woman.
- Yes.
Here we are.
That's Otto. He is at your service.
He speaks some French.
- Morning, Otto.
- Good morning, monsieur.
Well, well!
Nice cloth!
Goodness!
German organisation is beautiful!
Very simple! I went to see your usual suppliers and
- they have your measurements, right?
- Bravo!
- Besides, your providers are also mine.
- Bravo again!
Why are they going through here?
There's only one door for the whole apartment, my Lord.
I'll leave you, Mr. Laroche.
I hope you'll have all you need.
My dear, I'll be in clover.
Thank you very much.
Good evening, monsieur.
See you later!
Well, if that's how it is,
I'll have my bath.
Beautiful tub!
Solid copper!
Smell good, monsieur!
Guerlain! Paris!
French newspapers, Monsieur!
- Le Gaulois, L'écho de Paris.
- Perfect. Thank you.
If monsieur needs me, he rings, please.
Thank you.
If you want to make me a happy man,
Marguerite,
Marguerite,
If you want to make me a happy man,
Marguerite, give me your heart.
If you give me your heart,
Mina belle, Mina Belle,
If you give me your heart,
I'll make you happy.
Come in.
Allow me, Sire.
Thank you, Mr. Laroche.
Let us sit, will you?
- You won't sit down?
- Thank you.
Tell me, monsieur, are you comfortable enough?
Certainly.
I've even had an excellent bath.
In a superb tub.
I'm really delighted to meet you.
As am I.
Monsieur Lupin!
At your Majesty's orders.
To tell the truth, I did not have you come here only
to have the pleasure of meeting you.
I had an idea.
It concerns something very important.
- For me.
- Well, Sire, if it's very important,
I'll ask you to wait a while.
I have, in my administration, someone quite remarkable but that person has, strangely enough, a passion for electricity.
What a strange taste!
Don't you think?
Especially for a pretty woman.
Well, monsieur, nothing can be hidden from you.
You see, monsieur,
I still use oil lamps.
I hate electricity.
You are right, sire, it's barbaric lightning.
But it won't be abandoned any time soon, unfortunately.
Otto, no need to search, it's right here.
God! What must I do to get what I want,
- without being spied on?
- But, Sire, do as I do.
You don't always do what you want, monsieur.
You're here, against your will.
- Am I wrong?
- No, of course not, Sire.
I'm getting now to why you're here.
Let's see...
A little problem, monsieur.
Given a hiding place, a very secret one, in my castle, on this floor.
If Arsène Lupin, at liberty to search the premises as he pleases, does not succeed in discovering this hiding place in... let's say two days, you're following me?
Right...
What would be the odds of this for a spy himself often obliged to hide?
None, Sire. In either case the hiding would be well done.
I need to be sure of the safety of a hiding place that I've had built.
And where I want to put away safely personal documents and things of value.
Will you take 48 hours to search for this secret hiding place?
And if you find it, would you try to open up this hiding place?
Sire, you did tell me that the hiding place is situated on this actual floor?
On this very floor.
I won't need 48 hours.
Tomorrow, I'll be gone.
- So soon?
- But I must, Sire.
Besides, I have things to do in Paris.
I am a very busy man, you know.
What's more, I've arranged to have you compensated.
No, I must.
What would you say to a sum matching the yearly income of your... of your parisian activities.
Let's say 100,000 marks.
I'd be really curious to know how your Majesty got to that figure.
My administration has worked out statistics about you.
Do you agree with their calculations?
They may be right,
I don't add it up.
I'll add that if you manage to open the hiding place, you'll find quite a beautiful ring in it. that you will be allowed to keep, as a souvenir of me.
I accept, Sire.
I adore souvenirs.
You haven't got it yet.
No, Sire but I'll have it soon.
- Really?
- I believe so.
Thank you.
Really, my dear, I like you a lot.
A pity you're not German, monsieur.
I would have done something for you.
Sire, I'm pleased to be French.
For the tranquility of your police.
I'm really pleased to know you.
Good evening.
You frightened me!
- You don't say "tu" now?
- I hate you!
- Listen, Mina, I don't understand.
- Enough!
Why are you here anyway?
André!
Don't play the fool!
If you take it that way,
I won't tell you anything.
I'm listening to you.
I'll explain it to you.
I've got to search everywhere.
Search everywhere? Why?
Because I'm being paid to do it.
And do you know who is paying?
The Emperor pays you.
But what for, please?
I'm looking for a hiding place.
An extraordinary hiding place which is very difficult to find.
Does that mean anything to you?
Never mind!
I'll look on my own.
I know nothing about a hiding place.
- I'll find it without your help.
- André!
- Not now.
- Why not?
You'll be late for the hunting party.
His Majesty will be mad.
I am not going.
That's madness. You must!
- Not at all, I do as I please.
- The Emperor invited you.
But that meant nothing, just out of courtesy.
What's more, I slept badly,
I'm very tired.
- Truly.
- Yes, I'm only a little man, a poor little Frenchman.
A very little one.
André...
Let's go to my place, shall we?
No, I must search first.
This hiding place... I know, I feel that I'm going to find it.
Let's see.
But who told you that it was in this room?
My little finger!
Nice fish tank!
You're wasting your time, you know.
I don't know.
That remains to be seen.
That's odd!
Come here!
What's wrong?
It smells like Mina here near the fish tank. Let's see!
Now that you're here,
I smell nothing but you.
Delicious, actually.
These fish are very pretty.
Aren't they?
In any case, the fish tank is wonderful.
I'll have one like this made at home.
With running water.
André!
What's with you?
André, I beg you. The Emperor will be waiting for you, he'll be mad at you.
It will make a very bad impression, you know.
- Ingenious.
- Yes, come on.
- That's odd.
- What now?
Come on!
- Wait! I'm thinking of something.
- What?
Why is that tap hidden?
So that it's prettier.
Indeed! I could have worked that out by myself.
Come on, André!
Wait!
You're not a child any more, André!
Oh yes I am.
That's idiotic!
It will overflow.
There!
The people who devised that are artists.
Poets.
It's lovely.
Very lovely!
Fine stone, isn't it?
I can keep it if I want to.
Your Emperor said to me: if you manage to open the hiding place, you'll find a beautiful ring there, that you may keep as a souvenir of me.
It's very elegant, isn't it?
Goodbye!
That's it!
You put the ring back. Why?
I must tell you something.
I rather like your Guillaume.
Which Guillaume?
Your Emperor!
I find him appealing.
If I tell I found his hiding place, he'll be disappointed, it will ruin his pleasure.
I want him to keep his nice hiding place.
So listen to me: he mustn't be told.
It's a deal?
I hope I can count on you.
Where are you going?
To see the Emperor.
To tell him about your success.
Let go!
Let me go!
Let go of me!
Let go of me!
A little tip!
On behalf of Guillaume.
Sorry, Majesty, your statistics are inaccurate!
Mina!
Your Lupin is a thief.
He took one million marks.
Mina, where are you going?
Gentlemen!
Quick! Quick!
Did you see that Frenchman leave?
Yes, your Majesty.
We saw him one minute ago.
Why are you speaking French?
Why am I still speaking French?
Such a hiding place is worth a million marks.
- Baroness, it's a real joy.
- Have you seen Mr. Laroche?
- No, not for several days.
- Where shall we sit?
Your Ladyship didn't reserve a table?
No, why?
I have nothing left.
At this hour...
It's midnight.
Your Lordship should have phoned.
We arrived tonight.
A woman's whim.
There's a free table.
Unfortunately, it's not free.
It's Mr. Laroche's.
But since he is not here.
He might come.
I can't give his table up.
I'll take it.
Your Ladyship, I can't let you.
That table is reserved all year long.
Mr. Laroche is a friend of mine.
I'll settle it with him.
I'll see your Ladyship later.
Mr. Paul, there's no Pommery 1906 left.
Yes there's some in the Reserve. Go!
You're really the most dynamic woman I know.
Next to you, my dear Rudolf, everyone is dynamic.
I know.
Isn't that the same maharajah who was at the Prime Minister's party?
Of course, it's the Bindapuhr rajah.
Look...
He wears on his turban the famous Hiyama Annapurna, a 70 carat stone.
A priceless gem.
Excuse me.
That waiter is very clumsy.
He is.
What will you have?

Subtitles by cinephage & nottsforest.
Good afternoon, sir.
HoW can I help you, Miss?
Haven't they come from The Sicomoros to pick me up?
The Sicomoros?
You're Miss Marta González,
Don Emilio's niece, right?
Yes, sir, hasn't my uncle come to pick me up?
Yes. He Was here at noon, but left
When he heard about the landslide.
And, What time is he going to be back?
No, I don't think he'll be back, Miss.
We thought We Wouldn't have trains until tomorroW, but as you can see, they've been stopping here since half an hour.
Isn't there anybody Who can take me to The Sicomoros?
I'm afraid not, Miss.
People don't go out after sunset.
So, What should I do?
You can only Wait until tomorroW.
Look, that man over there has the same problem.
Miss, don't ask any more questions,
I've already tried everything.
But, my aunt is very sick, and I need to get to The Sicomoros tonight.
Yes, I also lied about my nepheW's Baptism, but it didn't Work.
Come With me, this Will take a While, take a seat and relax. Here, I'll help you.
You knoW, it seems that people here are terrified to leave their houses after sunset...
I Wanted to Walk to the closest toWn, about three hours aWay from here, but that fat man over there Wouldn't let me.
Someone's coming.
What an ugly man.
Yes, he is not very attractive, you're right.
I've come to pick up that box.
Here's the ticket.
All right, it's all yours.
Isn't it a shame to have someone deliver soil from Hungary?
Soil?
What's Wrong With our soil?
Whims of the rich.
It's for a man called Mr. Duval,
Who's lived here for 10 years.
I think he's a little bit crazy, he's very odd, only goes out at night and Wears a black cape like that one.
Wait a minute, I have an idea.
Good afternoon, sir, sorry to bother you, but, can you give a ride to that lady?
She's very pretty and she'd be good company on the road.
I'm not going into toWn.
She neither, she's going to The Sicomoros.
Where?
To The Sicomoros.
All right.
- Tell her to come here.
- Thank you.
It's all settled.
He'll take you to The Sicomoros.
Hurry.
But, Where are you going?
I'm going Where you're going.
Just go.
If you're going to The Sicomoros.
Then, I'm going to The Sicomoros.
Let's go, pal.
Just a moment, Wait.
I Want to see her one last time.
I can keep it, sir.
Rest in peace, beloved sister.
This is What she alWays Wanted, patrón,
God Wants her to rest here for ever.
Thus Will be, The Sicomoros
Will alWays belong to us.
Anselmo...!
Read this.
What happened?
You should get off here.
But, this is not The Sicomoros.
I take a detour here, you can continue on that road.
Take us there,
We'll pay you Whatever you Want.
I can't...
Get doWn, get doWn.
All right, all right.
Bastard, he could've taken us there.
Well, Where are We noW?
At the crossroad.
We need to folloW that fence to The Sicomoros.
Is it far from here?
- Half an hour from here.
- Half an hour?
Miss, if We're going to Walk for half an hour, in this foggy and deserted place,
We'd better get to knoW each other, don't you think?
My name is Enrique.
I'm Marta.
Nice to meet you.
Well, noW I'll tell you some things about me.
I have a mole on my back, on this side.
I hate the countryside, because I think it's a place for coWs, not for people, and I'm a commercial traveller.
I Work in a store, and they let me...
...my uncle Emilio Wrote to me tWo days ago saying that I should come today, that I should be here no matter What.
Your ill aunt's husband?
No, they're brothers,
I have another aunt living in The Sicomoros, but none of them is married.
Hey, Miss, are you sure this is the right Way?
This seems a bit long to me.
Sure, I knoW this place.
I hope my aunt isn't seriously ill.
She Was like a mother to me.
She raised me as a child.
Hey, Why didn't they get married?
Are they too ugly?
No, on the contrary, they Were very pretty
When they Were young, noW they're too old.
They just lived in the Hacienda by themselves and didn't go out.
I can imagine.
What about your uncle?
My uncle Emilio is different.
He travelled all around the World for many years, he came to The Sicomoros tWo months ago.
I still remember the yard full of floWers, the bright hallWays.
The cages With birds.
The fountain.
The most Wonderful memories from my childhood are in that bright yard...
This is called the hanging tree, the road makes a turn here and soon We'll be at the front gate.
What are you looking at?
I don't knoW, I couldn't tell.
I've been having a Weird feeling since he left us on the road.
What do you mean?
I feel that someone has been folloWing us.
I haven't seen anybody.
Me neither, but I felt something cold on my back.
What do you Want?
I'm Marta, my uncle and aunts are Waiting for me.
Yes, Miss, I'll open right noW.
HoW are you, Anselmo?
My child.
Let me help you, sir.
Why is everything so deserted?
Miss, it has been like this for a long time.
It's hard to get people to Work in the Hacienda, no one Wants to Work in Sierra Negra anymore.
A lot of people have left the toWn.
That place is deserted.
It looks like a cemetery.
But, come on in, come in.
It's your niece, sir, and she's With a gentleman.
Martita!
Uncle!
My child...
We thought you Were coming tomorroW.
Yes, I knoW.
Marta!
Don't I get a hug?
It's your aunt...
Eloísa.
Don't you recognize me anymore?
Is this the old aunt?
Aunt!
You look the same as When I left here.
It's been so long.
It's incredible, you look like a different person... and my aunt María Teresa,
Where is she?
She died yesterday...
We've just buried her.
Come on, don't cry... it's no use.
Come on, let's go upstairs.
Excuse me, sir, can you get me my luggage?
Your luggage?
- I'm leaving.
- Why?
I have to go.
Martita, the gentleman is leaving.
I'm sorry, I forgot about him!
This gentleman Was kind enough to bring me here from the station...
Why don't you stay, at least for tonight?
Where are you going to go noW?
To a hotel.
- A hotel?
- Yes.
No, We haven't had hotels in Sierra Negra for a long time noW.
Where are you going to go?
This is your home too, please, stay.
Come this Way.
- Thank you.
- Come in.
I'm so sorry to have come in such a painful time.
It's painful... yes, very much... although We should be happy for her death.
Why do you say that, aunt?
You have no idea hoW much she suffered these last months, right, Emilio?
Yes, in fact, only death could free her from the pain she Was suffering.
HoW did she die?
She suffered a heart attack, but she had been disturbed for five years.
You mean insane?
Yes, she experienced persecutory delusions.
What Were her fears?
Vampires.
Vampires!
Yes, things she heard from the people in the other toWn... they're extremely supersticious.
She Was convinced there Was a vampire someWhere in this house, stalking her to suck her blood, and at night, she suffered even more.
She Would lock herself up in her room and surround herself With all the crucifixes and mirrors in the house.
And, Why Would she do that?
Nonsense, those are legends.
Yes, they say you can scare aWay vampires With crucifixes, and you can find them With mirrors.
Yes, I've heard something like that.
It's said they don't reflect on mirrors, right?
Yes, that's What they say.
Well, excuse my niece.
She's very tired from the trip and I don't think she Wants to hear this.
You're right, aunt, let's go.
Excuse us.
Please, madam.
Do you collect old books?
No, I don't understand a thing about that.
They've alWays been there.
They seem to be part of a file from an old mine in Sierra Negra.
Unfortunately, it's too late, right?
Yes.
Doctor!
I folloWed your instructions, no one knoWs Who I am, or Why I'm here.
Then, keep it that Way until you leave, I beg you.
It'd be very painful if they found out noW the reason you are here.
Soil?
And he Will come to life again, my brother, Count Karol Lavud, buried by his enemies,
Who put an end to his inmortality in this unWorthy crypt.
This is soil from the cemeteries in the Woods of Baconia.
We Will take it to his grave in tWo moons.
Its hidden poWer Will revive him at the very minute of the one hundred anniversary of his death, and then We Will continue enjoying our lost happiness that We shared in other times.
And together, We Will impose in this county the poWer and the domain of the house of Lavud...
Bring the horses, Jorge,
We Will leave immediately.
Do you knoW that you are one of the oWners of The Sicomoros?
No, I didn't knoW it.
María Teresa gave you her part in her Will.
She Was so kind With me.
You are an oWner of The Sicomoros, like Emilio and me.
But, The Sicomoros is not What it used to be.
There are people Who Want to buy it.
They Would pay good money.
But, Would you sell The Sicomoros?
Yes, I Want to sell it.
But Emilio doesn't Want to.
According to the deed, We shall reach a majority of votes
Within the oWners to decide upon the sale.
Then, I'm the one making a decision?
Yes.
Could We talk about this some other day, aunt?
Everything has happened so quickly, that it seems like a nightmare.
Think it over, the house is a Wreck.
People don't Want to Work in the countryside anymore.
But, she is buried here...
What's Wrong, aunt?
Nothing, someone's coming...
Be careful, there's a stranger in the house.
I knoW, don't lose sight of him.
He is a very important neighbor, he may have come to offer condolences.
You should meet him.
Excuse me With him, please,
I'll meet him some other day...
I'm exhausted, and I don't feel like talking to anybody.
All right, I'll take care of him.
Have a good night.
You too, aunt.
Mr. Duval, he's a neighbor.
Duval, Duval...
Oh, I knoW.
You are the importer of soil from Hungary.
What are you saying?
He is just exaggerating.
He may have seen a box With soil that I picked up at the station.
He might think I receive them all the time.
That's just a sample.
If that's a sample, I can't imagine
What a Whole order Would be.
I don't understand.
It's an old tradition.
Don't tell me it's soil from a cemetery.
No, nothing like that.
I'll use it to plant roses from the Woods of Baconia.
The tradition says you should use soil from their origin, that's Why I brought it.
What Was that?
A book fell from the bookshelf.
But, hoW? No one touched it.
It must have slipped...
This is a very interesting book.
It's a manuscript and it's over a 100 years old.
They are all from the same time.
Minutes on the murder of Count Karol de Lavud, founder of The Sicomoros, native of Baconia, in the reign of Hungary...
Well, What a coincidence!
This guy is a relative of yours.
Yes, that's What it seems.
I bet that Lavud is the same that's buried in the crypt.
It might Well be.
Well, according to this book, he has been buried for more than 100 years.
Of course, his headstone is the oldest in the cemetery.
Poor man, he must be all ashes by noW.
The gentleman's room is ready.
Thank you, María.
If you'll excuse me, I'll go to my room.
Can I take this book With me?
I'd like to leaf through it.
Of course.
Thank you...
Nice to meet you, Mr. Duval.
Good night.
ShoW him his room, María.
This Way, please.
Would you shoW me the Way, please?
- Certainly.
- Thank you.
What's your name?
María.
- María, nice name.
- And your last name?
Santoyo, sir.
Interesting felloW.
Why is he here?
I don't knoW.
I think he is a commercial traveller.
He came along With Martita from the station.
I think she doesn't knoW him either.
He'll leave tomorroW.
But, is she already here?
Yes, but she Won't come doWn noW.
She's very tired.
Have you told her that I Want to buy The Sicomoros?
Don't get too excited, Mr. Duval.
Martita has a special affection for this Hacienda and Will probably agree With me on the idea of not selling it.
It'll be a shame if she rejects my offer.
A real shame.
This is your room, sir.
Thank you.
Have a good night.
No, don't go, María. I Want to talk With you.
Tell me, Who helped the lady that died?
A servant, sir.
Those nervous attacks she Was having lately, did she have them at a certain time or at any time of the day?
No, sir, she only had them at night.
My late patrona didn't have nervous attacks, nor Was she crazy.
Well, they Were superstitions then.
No, sir, they Weren't.
They Weren't beliefs either, these Were real things.
Don't tell me a vampire Was stalking her.
Vampires exist, believe it or not.
Have you seen one?
God forbids it... but my grandfather Was killed by one
100 years ago, in the tunnel of a mine.
Several people died during that time, all of them from bleeding neck Wounds.
Nobody Wanted to Work in the mine anymore. It's all ruins noW.
TWo felloWs from toWn killed him afterwards.
They killed him?
The only Way you can kill a vampire, because there's no knife or gunshot that can kill them.
Then, hoW do you get rid of them?
By sticking them a Wood stake in their chest While they are sleeping.
And, you are afraid of a vampire that died 100 years ago?
No, sir, that one is buried in the crypt.
This is a different one.
Nobody has seen him yet, but the same things are happening.
They've already found dead bodies by the roads, all of them With marks on their necks, and Without a trace of blood.
Nobody Wants to go out at night, and even the animals in the mountain have run to other mountains.
That's nonsense.
Don't make fun of What people from the countryside tell you.
Vampires exist.
They sleep in the day and go out at night looking for young people's blood, that's the only thing they eat.
May God protect you, so that they don't kill you nor make you a vampire.
If they bite you tWice, then you Wouldn't groW old and Would live like the souls in the purgartory in eternal inmortality.
Let the Virgen del Socorro take care of you over the night, sir.
Good night.
Receive my condolences once again.
Sleep, sleep.
That I ask the night,
While I take care of you...
- Please let me go.
- We can't do that, Miss Lowell.
Mr. Brown wants you should see the fight, it's only the third round.
I'll go back, just let me go by myself.
Mr. Brown is mad already, we lost you for two minutes.
I promise I won't run away.
- Where will I go?
- All right. Let her go.
I've changed my mind.
I don't want to see the fights.
I'm hungry.
Call a cab.
Call a cab.
- But, Mr. Brown wants... - Mr. Brown says to keep her happy, call a cab.
93rd Precinct, Sgt Leeds.
- Sit down! Captain Peterson.
- Yes, sir. I know, sir.
- The Lieutenant?
- He's on duty, sir.
But he's still in his office?
I know! I know!
Hell, Leonard! It's good to see you relax for a change.
- Evening, Captain. Anything urgent?
- Urgent?
Anything urgent I leave to my subordinates.
- Got some good 10 cent cigars in that box over there. - No, thanks. I'm off cigars.
Brandy! My doctor's got me off everything worth living for... almost.
- Leonard?
- Yes, sir?
Now, there's got to be a stop to your complete disregard of the taxpayers money.
Paid for this apple out of my own pocket, Captain.
Leonard, you spent $18,600 in the last six months!
Investigating one man, a single man!
Brown's not a man, he's an organization.
And, I need money to fight money.
Now look, Lieutenant. I've got nothing against you personally, I admire you.
You've got too many brains, but that's not your fault.
Now, what about this $18,600? How am I going to explain this to the Commissioner?
Well, I've... dictated an explanation if you want to use it.
Memorandum to Captain Peterson covering expenditures of the 93rd Precinct station.
The Combination is growing stronger every day,
the only way to crush it is to get the top man.
When Grazzi left the country, Brown...
What do you think this is, a homicide investigation?
You're dealing with the largest pool of illegal money in the world!
You're fighting a swamp with a... teaspoon.
The Combination keeps no books, no records.
Everything's run on word of mouth and hard cash!
- That's their one weakness.
- What?
They have to have a treasurer.
- So?
- And, I know his name.
The name of a man who can pick up a phone and call Chicago or New Orleans and say: "Hey, Bill. Joe is coming down for the weekend, advance him 50,000."
And, he hangs up the phone and the money is advanced. Protection money!
Then a new all night bar opens, with gambling outside city limits.
A bunch of high school kids come in, for a good time.
They get loaded, they get irresponsible.
They lose their shirts.
And, they get a gun! Cause they're worried, they want to make up their loses, and a filling station attendant is dead with a bullet in his liver!
And, I have to see four kids on trial for first degree murder. Look at it!
First degree murder because a certain
Mr. Brown picked up a phone.
You can't touch Brown, he's clean.
We've got nothing on him!
Not even a parking ticket...
Yeah, why is he so careful?
It's unnatural!
You can't tell a jury a man's guilty because he's too innocent...
- He's no more innocent than this gun!
- Now stop getting emotional, Leonard!
He's innocent until he's proven guilty.
Yes, Captain.
Is there anything else, Captain?
Yes.
The girl.
Susan Lowell.
You've had a tail on her for six months. Why?
She's Brown's girl.
She's our most valuable lead.
We know next to nothing about Brown, but... a woman knows, she makes it her business to know.
If I can get a hold of her and make her talk...
Leonard, you've spent six months trying!
She went to Vegas, you went to Vegas.
She flew to Cuba, you flew to Cuba.
You couldn't get authorization for the expense, paid it out of your own pocket.
I had to, you wouldn't back me up.
Well, I'm not in love with her, Leonard. You are!
This is off the record, Leonard.
It's between friends.
Try to face facts.
You can't bear to think of her in the arms of this hood.
Forget her!
You're a cop, Leonard. There's 17,000 laws on the books to be enforced.
You haven't time to reform wayward girls.
She's been with Brown three and a half years.
That's a lot of days... and nights.
Face it, Leonard...
I'm glad you agree.
Just don't run away. We'd only have to come after you, Mr. Brown wouldn't like that.
Mr. Audubon.
Susan!
Well, I... Well, I'm glad to see you.
How are you? It's been years!
Well, you look so different somehow, Susan. I...
- Well, I hardly recognized you.
- Oh, I'm just the same, Mr. Audubon.
Well, how's your lovely mother?
She's in England someplace,
I haven't kept track.
Why, I should think you'd of gone along. I hear that
Vladovich is playing a Beethoven cycle.
I haven't the interest I once had in the piano, Mr. Audubon.
Well, now I'm disappointed.
You don't play anymore?
The only thing I play now,
Mr. Audubon, is stud poker.
- Will you dance with me, Mr. Audubon?
- Why certainly, Susan.
You all right?
Of course! Of course!
The day Mr. Brown lets go our little lady...
I'll do it personally.
- Mr. Audubon...
- Susan.
I've taken some pills,
I think I'm dying.
Susan!
Get an ambulance!
She just fell over!
How you feel now, Bennie?
Lost.
I feel terrible, Mr. Brown.
You kept fighting, Bennie.
You've got heart.
I lost three of my teeth too.
All right, so you lost. Next time you'll win. I'll show you how.
Take a look at Joe McClure here.
He used to be my boss, now I'm his.
What's the difference between me and him?
We breath the same air, sleep in the same hotel.
He used to own it!
Now it belongs to me.
We eat the same steaks, drink the same bourbon.
Look!
Same manicure, same cufflinks.
But, there's only one difference... we don't get the same girls.
Why?
Because women know the difference!
They got instinct.
First is first and second is nobody.
- The best man won tonight, Mr. Brown.
- You were better than Martinez.
Only, you threw it away. You step in the ring, you shake hands with him.
You want to be his friend, and you want to fight him. No, Bennie. No.
- Mr. Brown.
- Shut the door!
Now, Bennie, who runs the world?
Have you any idea?
- Not me, Mr. Brown.
- That's right, not you.
But, a funny thing... they're not so much different from you.
They've got something.
They've got it and they use it.
I've got it, he hasn't!
So, what is it, Bennie?
What makes the difference?
Hate.
Hate is the word, Bennie.
Hate the man who tries to beat you!
Kill him, Bennie! Kill him!
Hate until you see red and you'll come out winning the big money.
And, the girls will come tumbling after.
You'll have to shut of your phone and lock the door to get a night's rest.
Get on your feet, Bennie.
What you do that for, Mr. Brown?
You should have hit me back.
You haven't got the hate.
Tear up Bennie's contract!
He's no good to me anymore.
- Where's Susan, in the car?
- I tried to tell you before, Mr. Brown.
- Tell me what?
- She's in General Hospital.
- What happened?
- She took some pills.
Get the car and bring it around!
Buy me some cigarettes.
Where is she?
General Hospital.
She's dying.
You can take her to the prison ward now.
Hello, Lieutenant. This is Mr. Brown.
- What do you want, Mr. Brown?
- Joe, tell the man I want her out.
Mr. Brown would like to have Miss Lowell released, he'll put her in a private hospital
- Is he a relative? - Not exactly.
- Married to her? - Just a personal friend.
Ya, visiting days are Tuesdays and Fridays.
I don't know how you two got in here
- you can get out the way you came.
- Tell the man not to get excited.
Mr. Brown is a very reasonable man, you don't know him.
Oh, is he?
Well, I'm not. And, I intend to make life very difficult for your Mr. Brown.
You shouldn't talk like that, Lieutenant.
You're overstepping your authority.
Joe, the man has reason to hate me.
His salary is $96.50 a week.
The busboys in my hotel make better money than that.
Don't you see, Joe?
He's a righteous man.
Personal feelings mean nothing to him.
My girl's dying in a public hospital and I want her out!
She's under arrest, Mr. Brown.
- What's the charge?
- Homicide!
- That's ridiculous, she wouldn't kill a fly.
- She tried to kill herself.
- Is that a crime?
- It happens to be against two laws:
God's and Man's. I'm booking her under the second.
Tell the man if he puts her on trial I'll...
Alicia!
Alicia...
Susan.
- Stay away from the prisoner, Mr. Brown.
- Susan, you all right?
Brown, stay where you are!
- Susan!
Joe.
Tell the man I'm gonna break him so fast he won't have time to change his pants!
Tell him the next time I see him he'll be down in the lobby of the hotel, crying like a baby and asking for a $10 loan!
Tell him that!
And, tell him I don't break my word.
You must have done something pretty fine to get as high as you are, Mr. Brown.
I'm looking into that, I'm gonna open you up and I'm gonna operate.
And, I hate to think of what I'll find.
What I tell you, Joe? A righteous man.
Miss Lowell?
Do you hear me, Miss Lowell?
Are you a doctor?
My name is Diamond, I'm a detective.
Let me alone.
I have to ask you certain questions and you'll have to answer them.
I feel so cold. Can't they turn on the heat?
Can you get some hot coffee, please?
If you'd get up and walk you'd be a lot better off.
I want to go to sleep, just let me sleep.
Here. Just take some of this, come on.
You're very kind.
Everyone's kind.
I don't deserve it
Come on now, take a little of it.
That's it.
It's good.
Why did you try to kill yourself?
I don't know why. I can't remember.
Please let me go to sleep.
- Were you jealous, is that why? Was there another woman? - Please, please...
There was another woman wasn't there?
You mentioned her name Alicia Is that right?
What about Alicia? Was
Mr. Brown seeing Alicia?
No! I don't know.
I don't know who she is.
- Then how do you know her name?
- I don't know...
You must know, you kept repeating it.
Where'd you first hear it?
I never heard it.
I saw it.
Where'd you see it, on a letter?
In his apartment.
It was raining outside, and... there was a... mist on the window...
He was writing a name on it with his finger like this...
A moist glass...
'Alicia'.
And, when he saw me he... he rubbed it out.
- Oh, I'm so cold!
- Where is Alicia now?
- I don't know.
- Didn't you ask him?
He wouldn't tell me.
What was that?
Diesel trucks going by, it's almost morning.
Was Brown upset when you asked him about Alicia?
I don't know any answers! Don't touch me! Go away! Please, go away!
You think you're the bright, respectable girl you were four years ago, you're not!
You attempted suicide, you're under arrest!
You could be sent to jail for six months!
Nurse! May I have some water please?
- Miss Lowell, answer one question.
- No!
- Who is Alicia?
- You tell me.
Get on your feet!
- There's a man downstairs with a writ of habeas corpus. - Already?
It's McClure, what'll I tell him?
You know what habeas corpus means, Sam?
I know what it does.
It's Latin, it means:
"you may have the body".
Mr. Brown may have it.
Sam.
We got to find out who Alicia is.
I want you to pick up every hood who works for Brown.
And, pick up Brown himself.
- What's up?
- He's crazy
- Who?
- Diamond! He's crazy!
What happened, McClure?
When they picked us up
I mentioned your name.
You know what they said?
Quit shaking. What'd he ask you?
A girl's name!
That's all he kept asking.
He just kept asking me this girl's name.
- Like he was nuts!
- He's crazy.
What girl?
They knocked it outta my head.
I don't know...
Alice-something or another...
Alicia! That's what it was. Alicia.
What'd you tell him?
Exactly what I know... nothing.
That's right, Fante. You know nothing, absolutely nothing... and don't forget it.
I got a right to make a phone call.
- Who do you wanna call?
- Mr. Brown.
Mr. Brown's a little busy right now in a conference with Mr. Diamond.
You know, legally I don't have to submit to this test.
I know, we appreciate your cooperation, Mr. Brown.
And, if I say no?
Well, if you say no I have a lot of questions to ask, you may be sitting in that chair for a couple of days. This way I can tell if you're lying in a few minutes.
Go ahead, lad. Let's get it over with.
Picking me up for peddling without a license, you could have thought of something better than that, Lieutenant.
I prefer it to be suspicion of murder, but... we had none today.
I would have been happy to accommodate you, a police lieutenant.
Now, I'm gonna say one word at a time, most of them won't mean a thing to you.
But, I want you to say whatever pops into your head.
- Like, if I say sweet...
- I say sugar.
If I say police...
I say $96.50.
Apple.
Pear.
- Blue.
- Ocean.
Brown.
Mr. Brown to you, only my friends call me Brown.
Water.
Whiskey.
- Gun.
- Permit.
- Spaghetti.
- Bettini.
- What? What's that?
- What's what?
Bettini.
Spaghetti joint on the north side.
- Since when? Never heard of it.
- You couldn't afford it.
- Go ahead, Joe.
- Women.
Expensive.
- Snow.
- White.
Alicia.
- What was the name again?
- A woman's name... Alicia.
- No.
- No what?
I said no, you want me to say it again?
You know Alicia, don't you?
- Sure.
- Who is she?
A two year old filly that broke her leg in the Jamaican stakes.
- I lost 10 grand.
- You're lying, Mr. Brown.
When you heard Alicia your heart went bang, you don't lie with your blood pressure
Do you know what this means?
It means you're scared.
Mr. Brown isn't scared of a horse. Who is she, what does she mean to you?
If that's a crime, book me!
Book me, small change.
All right, take him out, Sam.
To the bullpen?
No, back to the gutter.
Mr. Brown is a very influential citizen.
I ducked 14 calls from the Commissioner today, the 15th caught me.
One more call and I'm out.
Leonard, what were you doing?
Just give me one possible explanation, that's all I ask.
I was following a lead,
I was being logical.
96 false arrests...
- How am I going to explain?
- You'll only have to explain 95...
Sam, what'll I do with Leonard?
Tell me what to do!
Just give me another 18,000 for the Brown case.
The Brown case is closed. Kaput!
The end, no more! Case closed!
Hey, Sam...
What was the name of that hood we failed to pick up?
Ralph Bettini.
How long ago did he drop out of sight?
About seven years ago, why?
That's about the same time that Grazzi left the country and Brown took over.
Yeah, so?
Take a look at that graph.
See how it jumped after he said Bettini?
Bettini's was the only warrant we failed to serve.
He hasn't been around for years, maybe he's dead.
No, he's not. I... checked the morgue, the files, there's nothing.
Why don't you go home? Get some rest.
No, I've got a call to make first.
Leonard.
Peterson meant what he said.
You cross him, it means we're both out.
What can we lose, $96.50 a week?
- Oh, you've certainly got a nerve!
- Hi, Rita.
What's on your mind?
As if I didn't know.
- Thought maybe we could go dancing.
- I've been dancing, Lieutenant.
Further more, you haven't been around here for six months. And, further more, if you want a date do what the others do, call me first... a week in advance.
Rita, I...
I'm giving a party tonight. I thought maybe you'd like to come?
A party?
Who's gonna be there?
Just you and me.
The joke stinks!
Lieutenant... either book me or let go of my arm!
Leonard.
Leonard!
Take me to the party.
You're a beautiful girl, Rita.
But, you're stupid.
You can't say anything nice without spoiling it.
Why do you waste your time with a cop?
You could get me a nice, rich hoodlum.
You should be able to recommend one with your connections.
What is there about a hoodlum that appeals to certain women?
Hoodlums... detectives...
A woman doesn't care how a man makes his living... only how he makes love.
Who is she, Leonard?
I'm stupid, Leonard, about everything but men.
Them... I know.
Give me my shoes, I'm going home.
Put them on for me.
When she hurts you again, baby... don't wait six months.
Yes... I'm having a drink.
Well, don't forget me as if I were a lush!
That music, turn it off.
- I enjoy it.
- I said turn it off.
What are we so cheerful about today?
- Where did you get that outfit?
- What's wrong with it?
I like you better in white. You got a dozen white dresses, why don't you wear them?
White doesn't please me anymore.
A woman dresses for a man, you dress for me. Go put on something white!
I won't!
What's the matter with you?
What have I done now?
Before I came in when you were playing that record, what were you thinking?
I was trying to remember how
I fell in love with you.
That's so hard to remember?
A girl's first love shouldn't be, it should be her only.
Maybe that's why I can't leave you.
We'll talk about love some other time.
You know what I've been doing, what's been happening?
People tell me all sorts of things,
I don't listen.
I didn't ask you before, you were sick...
What did Diamond tell you?
Diamond! Lieutenant Diamond!
Detective, 93rd Precinct.
He grilled you for three hours in the hospital, what did he tell you?
- He kept asking me about a girl.
- What girl?
- Her name was Alicia.
- Who's she?
I don't know.
- He was very insistent.
- What was the name again?
Alicia.
Doesn't mean a thing to me.
Susan, tell me, come on...
What's bothering you?
I hate and despise you!
Susan... what are you trying to do, drive me bats?
What do you want, Susan? Tell me!
- I'll give you anything you want, tell me
- Nothing!
- Anything at all.
- Nothing! Nothing...
Lieutenant, you got a call while the Captain was in, I didn't want to disturb you. - Who?
She just said "Rita". She wants to see you and said you'd know where. - Thanks!
Say, Lieutenant!
Hi, Pop.
If you're looking for Rita, she's in her dressing room. - Thanks!
- Hi, Rita. - You certainly took your time getting here!
Come on, I've had a bad day.
Don't give me anymore.
What I've got to tell you is not good.
Fix this for me, will you?
Tell it!
Keep blowing your cork, pinching half the town!
- There's a big mad on you and it's burning all over! - Is that it?
- They're quoting a price on you, you'd better take a vacation. - What'd you hear?
It's all around, I picked up bits here and there. What are you gonna do?
Just what I've been doing only more.
Are you trying to...
Are you trying to get yourself killed, Leonard?
Brown doesn't kill to get what he wants, he buys.
Then you'd better sellout or start running.
Hey, you're really worried about me.
A little.
That's enough.
That's a lot for me.
That's my music!
- Leonard! - Yeah?
- When will I see you again?
Well, if I'm not dead you'll find me where I always am, in jail.
Shut up! Let's get him out of here!
When's he gonna wake up, Christmas?
Shoot me with my own gun, that's what gets me.
Fante!
- Let me wake him up.
- Leave him alone!
Mr. Brown doesn't want to draw any blood or show any marks.
May I talk to Mr. Brown?
Let me at him, Fante.
Two minutes is all I'll need.
- What for?
- I want to ask him one question.
All right, go ahead. He's all yours... but, first...
Paper.
Fante, we're friends. You don't hold up a friend.
Paper.
- Didn't Mr. Brown pay you?
- You're not Mr. Brown.
For Mr. Brown I'd snatch a judge from the
Superior Court, for a chocolate soda.
- Same goes for Mingo. Right, Mingo?
- Yeah!
- How much?
- A hundred.
- For Mingo too.
- What?
A hundred... each.
Mingo!
Thanks, Fante.
Now ask him all the questions you want.
What did you pick me up for?
I asked you a question!
Why did you pick me up?
I'm talking to you, answer me!
Why'd you pick me up?
There he is, Mr. Brown.
I was softening him up for you.
- I did a pretty good job.
- I told you not to touch him.
I didn't hurt him, we're still legal.
The trouble with you, McClure, is that you never took time to learn technique.
Fante! Mingo! Bring that radio over here.
Turn it on.
I only want to borrow it, Joe.
We're gonna give the Lieutenant a little concert.
- How's that?
- Too loud, turn it down.
Can you hear me, Lieutenant?
I just want to ask you one question and then you can go.
What are you looking for?
Maybe I can help you?
What about Alicia?
What's your information?
Arresting all my friends!
Phoney warrants!
What's behind it?
Mingo, try it.
Now, don't be stubborn, Lieutenant.
What about Alicia?
Why don't you ask yourself?
Nice break coming up, a kid on drums...
Real crazy!
You like crazy drums, Lieutenant?
Have a good time.
I think Mr. Diamond needs a drink.
Got any liquor?
- How about some paint thinner?
- No, that'll kill him. Anything else?
- Antonic, 40 % alcohol.
- Fine.
Come down here and hold his head, Fante.
Now, let him go.
Shove him off.
Look at that drunken cop.
Isn't that a shame?
Hold him!
Diamond, what are you doing here?
Well, well... Leonard.
You're drunk! My congratulations!
Come in.
The gall of him... grabbed one of my own officers. Slug him, torture him!
- You were right, Leonard. They're afraid of something. - Alicia.
Well, that's a start.
Let's go to work on Brown.
I'd like to start by picking up
Brown and company...
Well, you can't. They outsmarted you.
Take a look in the mirror, there's not a mark on you!
You were drunk, you came here on your own. That's the defense.
And it's airtight, Leonard. That's why Brown delivered you here.
His chief witness is me, Peterson!
I'm sorry, Leonard.
- Alicia...
- Alicia! Alicia!
They don't know if it's a horse, a boat, or a girl.
- What else have you got?
- Another name cropped up: Bettini.
- Bettini? - You ever hear of him?
- Ya, where does he fit in?
Out of 97 warrants he was the only one we couldn't pick up.
He turned up again on
Brown's lie detector...
Sit down, Leonard.
I remember him.
He was Grazzi's right-hand man, before
Brown, before McClure from my generation.
He dropped out when Grazzi had to leave the country.
- Dead?
- No, scared.
He didn't fit in with Brown's new setup.
None of the old crowd did.
Bettini didn't wait around to get himself killed.
Turned honest citizen. Changed his name and went into hiding.
Do you know where?
I did him a favor once. I could of put him away for something he didn't do.
I let it pass.
He did deserve it, considering all the times he was guilty
- and I didn't have the evidence.
- Well, tell me where to find him.
He'll be scared, Leonard.
Too scared to talk.
If he's that scared, he'll listen.
Come in.
Not yet.
Just a minute...
That's all I ask, just a minute.
Let me turn off the stove.
It could cause a fire, lots of nice old people in the building. Okay?
I've been... waiting for you a long time.
You... look like such a nice, young feller.
That Brown sure know how to pick 'em.
I would never of suspected.
Can I lie down... make it easy?
Come closer.
One shot ought to do it.
You're not going to die, Mr. Bettini.
I've got no money to offer you.
I've got something to offer you.
Don't fool with me, young fella!
Get it over with!
Mr. Brown didn't send me. My name is
Diamond. Lt Diamond, 93rd Precinct.
If you'll help me...
I can put your nightmare away.
I can't.
I can't even help myself, how could I help you?
I'm looking for a name... Alicia.
You ever hear of her?
Mean anything to you?
Alicia... is Mr. Brown's wife.
Who told you?
She told me.
She was a good girl.
Healthy, right off the farm.
Brown married her when he was a prison guard.
Two years later she was a lush, she'd drink anything.
Then...
Brown got tired of her.
So, he got rid of her!
Take your time, Mr. Bettini.
He was on Grazzi's boat... three days out from Portugal.
Alicia... came to the table drunk.
Brown told her to go sleep it off.
She called him a name.
Grazzi laughed, not Brown.
I remember the look on Brown's face... and then he hit her.
Then she got up from the table and she... pulled of her wedding ring. It was hard to pull off, it must've been... grown to her finger.
She pulled it off and throw it in the ocean.
Then what?
Then she went to her cabin...
- I never seen her again.
- What happened to her?
How do you know?
I know Brown.
I know Brown too, that's no evidence.
Then... there was the ship's anchor.
What about it?
We stopped at the Azores... and the skipper went to shore and got another one.
You think she was murdered, then... tied to the ship's anchor and dropped into the sea?
I don't know which came first...
I jumped ship the moment we landed.
Who was the skipper?
Some Swede.
What was his name?
- I never talked to the man.
- What did he look like?
A uniform. Who looks at the uniform?
It's important, Mr. Bettini.
If the anchor was used the skipper would surely know.
He'd have to be paid off, or... killed off.
Now, try... Please try to remember his name.
Go away! Leave me alone!
Seven years I don't talk to nobody, now I talk too much.
You'll have to come with me, Mr. Bettini.
You're locking me up?
The next stranger who comes in... won't be from the police.
You'll be safer with us.
You better... Pack your things.
I got them all on me.
Except this.
How come a nice guy like you is a cop?
Just lucky I guess.
You like antiques, Officer?
Who can afford them?
If you're a captain on a boat borne for Portugal... and you keep your mouth shut... you can buy a lot of antiques.
Maybe a whole store full.
Yes, my love. That is what
I've been telling you for the last five minutes, but you don't listen.
Well, be calm, we can change our plans.
What can I do for you, Sir?
I'm Lt Diamond, police.
Diamond! Expensive name.
I won't take much of your time, Mr. Dreyer.
I just want to ask you a few questions.
Please.
- It's about a large purchase you made.
- Yeah, well I have complete books.
Every dollar is there in black and white... unless it goes in the red!
This purchase was made in 1946.
I'm sorry, I was not in business then.
So, I... I can't help you.
I was hoping you'd have some record, it's... about the purchase of an anchor.
I don't understand.
In 1946 you were skipper of a private boat, bound from New York Harbor for Lisbon, Portugal.
On the way you stopped at the Azores and bought a new anchor. Why?
I don't understand...
Well, try a little harder.
You don't know me, I'm very stupid.
The boat was a cabin cruiser owned by Grazzi.
It's now being operated by a Mr. Brown.
Do you know Mr. Brown?
I had lunch with him last week, he's a very fine gentleman.
He's a hoodlum.
Because I have lunch with him, that is not a crime.
I have lunch with anybody,
I'm democratic.
I'll even have lunch with you.
Who paid for this shop?
Me, Dreyer.
You, Dreyer, borrowed the money from the Bolmec Corporation.
The Bolmec Corporation is Brown, or Brown and Grazzi.
Mr. Brown doesn't pay money for nothing.
What makes you so valuable to Mr. Brown?
What do you have on him?
My name is Nils Dreyer, I live at 821 Mason
Avenue. That is all I have to tell you.
You know, Mr. Dreyer. Things changed since I walked in here.
- Brown knows I'm here, he knows I'm talking to you. - I said nothing.
Yeah, but Brown doesn't know that.
In exchange for information, Mr. Dreyer,
I'll give you protection.
I'll do better than that,
I'll put you in jail.
Suppose you put me in jail. The man in the next cell happens to have a gun.
Boom! One dead Swede. Thank you very kindly, I'll remain stupid.
How did you get in here, Sir?
The store is closed.
I am late for an appointment, if you'll excuse me.
Mr. Dreyer, the secret you think keeps you safe will blow up in your face.
You're dealing with a... a ruthless man.
Mr. Diamond, I was a seaman for 30 years.
I went to sea aged 14.
I've seen storms, I've seen gunfire and I've seen torpedoes.
I've been wrecked not once, four times!
On a raft, 37 days, nothing but water.
Nothing kills me.
I'll die in Stockholm like my great-grandfather, aged 93.
I'm not scared of anyone including you, so... get out.
If you change your mind, Mr. Dreyer, just phone the 93rd Precinct,
I'll send a squad car for you.
Hello?
Hello?
Hello!
Sit down, Joe.
I wanted him here alive, what happened?
He had a gun. Didn't he, Fante?
- He had a gun all right, Mr. Br...
- I told you to go without guns!
- Which one of you changed my mind?
- I didn't have any gun with me.
- Mingo?
- It wasn't me, I swear.
Well, he pulled a gun on me, what'd you want me to do?
With your kind of brain there was nothing else he could do!
Now, listen to me you two.
Go about your business.
Go where you ordinarily go, do what you ordinarily do!
If they ask questions, say nothing!
And you, get upstairs, go to bed, stay there! You been sick, understand? Sick!
And, if they take you to police headquarters... shoot yourself in the head.
It'll make everything a lot simpler.
Now, get out!
Joe!
Come here.
Why did you do it, Joe?
- I thought he'd pulled a gun on me.
- I'm trying to run an impersonal business.
Killing is very personal.
Once it gets started it's hard to stop.
I could understand it if you were a trigger happy punk, but you're not.
You're an experienced man, Joe.
Why did you do it?
- I guess I'm getting too old to handle a gun. - Yeah...
Maybe you're just getting too old, Joe.
You don't like me much, do you?
You figure when Grazzi left the country you should've taken over instead of me.
Is that it?
No... the job's too big for me.
Yeah... you say that but you don't mean it.
Give me your gun, Joe.
Come on!
See what I mean, Joe?
Two seconds ago you had this gun in your hand.
We're all alone here.
The thought of using it flashed through your mind... but, you couldn't.
But you didn't hesitate to use it on Dreyer, why?
Because he was a little man, Joe.
Like you, a little man.
You got a soft job and good pay.
Stop thinking about what might have been.
And, who knows...
You may live to die in bed.
That's all, Joe.
- It's empty!
- It can't be.
- Did anybody open this since yesterday?
- Miss Hartleby? - Impossible, Sir.
What do you got?
It was Dreyer's life insurance.
Where would an ex-sailor keep a log book?
Dreyer was a very meticulous man, he kept a complete record of everything in his shop.
In his shop...
If you're looking for the log of
Grazzi's yacht in the summer of '46 you'll find it in there.
Sam, get the DA's office and get a warrant for Brown's arrest.
- On what charge?
- Ahh... Arson!
I got a court order, issued this morning.
It says that all the deeds, papers and properties of this shop belong to me.
Dreyer had 20 %.
The Bolmec Corporation had the rest and
I'm the Bolmec Corporation. Nobody else.
- Not even Grazzi?
- I bought him out.
Why should the Bolmec Corporation be interested burning that ship's log? Why?
Liquidation of assets.
Which is hardly a crime.
I'll wait until I can put you on trial for murder.
Who's murder, Lieutenant?
- Mine, if necessary.
- Don't push too hard.
It's my sworn duty to push too hard.
Diamond, the only trouble with you is you'd like to be me.
You'd like to have my organization, my influence, my fix.
You can't, it's impossible.
You think it's money, it's not.
It's personality... You haven't got it,
Lieutenant, you're a cop.
Slow, steady, intelligent...
With a bad temper.. and a gun under your arm.
Or, the big yearn for a girl you can't have.
First is first and second is nobody.
The DA's out, I have his assistant.
Hang up, Sam.
Miss Lowell.
Go away, please.
I'll only be a minute, Miss Lowell.
- Why here? Can't it wait?
- No.
Well... what is it, please?
- I've come to ask you a favor.
- Do I owe you one?
I want you to leave Mr. Brown.
I've asked you to leave, Mr. Diamond.
- Well, if you don't I will.
- You think this is mink, Miss Lowell?
Do you think these are the skins of wild animals sewn together for your pleasure?
You're mistaken.
- Take your hands off...
- These are skins of human beings, Miss Lowell.
People who have been beaten, sold, robbed... doped and murdered by Mr. Brown.
I didn't come here to hurt you, Miss Lowell.
You don't have to see me again or even speak to me again, but... save yourself, leave him.
How?
All you have to do is walk out.
Is that all, Mr. Diamond?
You followed me long enough to know I... can't.
I live in a maze, Mr. Diamond.
A strange, blind and backward maze.
And all the little twisting paths... lead back to Mr. Brown.
I can't but that, Miss Lowell.
Not in a million years.
Why do you want to change my life, Mr. Diamond?
My boss says I'm in love with you.
I keep telling myself I'm... just doing my job.
Is that why you came to see me?
No.
I brought you a present.
Keep it or burn it just as you please.
What is it?
It's a photograph of brown's wife.
Her name was Alicia.
You might ask him what happened.
- Who is it?
- Susan.
It's only 10:30.
Was the concert that dull?
Take your hands off me!
Okay.
- I want to talk to you.
- Not now, later. - No, now!
Come here, I want to show you something.
- What is all this?
- This is my bank.
I could've built this vault in my apartment, but that would have been too obvious.
We don't take checks, we deal strictly in cash.
There isn't anybody I would trust with so much temptation except myself.
Or, maybe you.
Trust me.
Who'd you see at the concert?
- Nobody.
- A nobody by the name of Diamond.
Then, why do you ask?
You know everything.
There's one thing Mingo and Fante can't tell you, whether I still love you.
- What did Diamond tell you?
- That he's in love with me.
Diamond in love? That's not possible, anymore than this clever machine.
- The machine gave me a strange present.
- What was it, a pair of handcuffs?
I want to meet her.
- I want to meet your wife, Mr. Brown.
- You can't.
- Why, because she's dead?
- No, she's alive.
She's living in Sicily, in Grazzi's house.
This was taken a month ago, came with one of her letters.
- Why did she send it to you?
- She wants to come back.
- Why did you leave her?
- I don't want to talk about it!
- I do.
- Can't you let me hold onto some pride?
I lost all mine with you.
All right, I'll tell you.
I was in love with her.
Me, a prison guard.
It was for her I began to work my way up.
All I had was guts. I traded them for money and influence.
I got respect from everybody but her.
She did anything she could to humiliate me.
She was always drunk, flirting with other men.
I tried to straighten her out.
I took her on a boat trip when
Grazzi had to go to Sicily.
The day after we docked, she disappeared.
I spent months looking for her!
Where do you think she was?
Living in Grazzi's house.
He was a bigger man than me.
Now you know who Alicia is.
Well, well, well. Good evening, Miss
Rita. How are you, how you been?
Lonely, Fred. Lonely... I'm between shows, have till 12:00.
Mr. Diamond is out...
- Would you like to go up there and wait for him? - Thanks.
Tell me what he does with his evenings.
Work.
- I'm gonna kill that guy.
- Don't you kill him.
He pays rent right on the dot,
I'd miss him.
You and me both.
Yeah?
No! No, I'm wide awake.
When do you want it done?
I understand.
- Mingo!
- What's the matter?
Mr. Brown wants an order filled tonight.
Who?
Diamond.
It's open.
Go?
Go!
Leonard?
- Leonard!
- What, Sam? What?
Whatever you're thinking, drop it.
It won't bring her back.
Saks Fifth Avenue.
She came to see me in her best shoes.
I'll call Peterson, he'll put every available man on it.
Never mind, Sam.
I said never mind!
We don't have to check bullets or fingerprints.
This room a name written all over it... Brown! Brown!
He wanted to kill me, he got tired of waiting. Well, so have I.
- What are you gonna do? - Close the case.
- I know how you feel.
- Nobody knows how another person feels!
- No matter, sit down!
Do me a favor... take off your gun.
I treated her like a pair of gloves.
If I was cold... I called her up.
Don't blame yourself, you'll go crazy.
I saw the papers this morning.
I'm sorry.
- Terribly, terribly sorry.
- Why, that it wasn't me?
Say what you came to say.
- I left Mr. Brown.
- You're a little late.
Brown killed the girl in your apartment.
- His men did it.
- Can you prove it?
- No, I... - Can you prove that Fante and
Mingo did it? That he ordered them to?
No.
Sit down.
Does he know you're gone?
He will.
- I opened his private vault.
- Why?
- I wanted to help you if I could.
- What does he keep in the vault?
Guns and money.
It's no crime to have money, or even to have a gun, only to use it.
- I saw something else.
- What?
Something about Alicia.
- Can you prove that she was murdered?
- No.
I can prove that she's alive.
What are you talking about?
She's living in Sicily, with Grazzi.
That's impossible.
She sent this to Brown.
It's Alicia all right.
Years older than her photograph taken on the boat.
Then she must be ali...
This photo was never taken in Sicily.
There's snow on the ground.
Yeah, it's the same girl all right.
She's sure changed since the other picture.
- Could that be a fake?
- No, Sir.
This was made with an ordinary, wide-angle lens.
- Now, judging from the scope...
- Never mind all that.
- Can you tell me when the picture was taken?
- The original was printed on Varagan paper.
Well, what does that mean?
It wasn't on the market till a year and a half ago.
Frank!
See the highway marker through the fence, can you tell me what this? Identify it?
No, I can't but I'll check it right away for you.
Will you do it quickly, please?
- Leonard.
- Yeah?
Alicia's alive.
- If there's no murder, there's no case.
- We may have an even stronger case.
I've been in touch with our overseas military intelligence.
They've been looking for Grazzi for years, not to be found!
And, there's no record that he ever got to Sicily.
What about Bettini's story?
Bettini was right about a murder taking place on the boat.
He was just wrong about the identity of the victim.
Wait a minute. Spell that out.
Well, I... I've been looking for the wrong murder.
Brown didn't kill his wife!
He killed his boss, Grazzi.
And, that's why our intelligence couldn't find him.
Grazzi is at the bottom of the Atlantic
Ocean tied to an anchor!
That's a beautiful theory, Leonard.
Beautiful!
Except for one small item.
You can't prove it, you have no witness.
Oh, you got it, Frank? Let's see it.
- State highway marker 225A.
- 225A, do you know where that is?
I can find it in two hours.
It's a one-lane gravel road that curves west from the coast highway.
I don't know why you've come to me, Officer.
My name is Anna Lee Jackson.
Are you sure you never took an ocean voyage?
Well, if I had I certainly would've remembered.
You really have a way with flowers.
- Thank you.
- What are these?
These are Stalk.
Beautiful, all of them.
How do you do it?
Oh, you have to love them.
They know the difference.
- Oh, my goodness!
- What is it?
A caterpillar.
Eating the buds.
- Well, why didn't you kill it?
- Oh, I couldn't kill anything.
I can't even cut these flowers.
If people want to see them they've got to come here where they're alive.
Not... withering and... dying in a vase.
- You feel that pretty strongly, don't you?
- Oh, yes I do.
I can tell you why you feel that way.
Can you?
Because you saw your husband murder a man named Grazzi.
I'll spell the name for you:
G-R-A-Z-Z-I. Grazzi.
I have a photograph of you... taken seven years ago.
You can have it if you like?
The men are old friends of yours, one alive, the other dead.
Now, listen to me, Alicia.
Brown, unfortunately, is not a caterpillar.
He doesn't eat flowers, he devours people.
I had a friend, a... girl,
24 years old.
She was murdered last night.
Brown thought he was killing me.
- He didn't even know her name.
- I don't hear anymore! Please!
Please, I'm sick!
Can't you see I'm sick?
You're sick all right, Alicia.
Sick with fright. Now you're in our custody, you have nothing more to fear.
You know that, because you're perfectly sane.
I'd rather be... insane and alive.
Then sane... and dead.
- It hurts.
- If you can move it, it's not broken.
- But, it hurts!
- Take a drink.
- I took a drink, it still hurts.
- Take another drink.
Fante, I'm trying to tell you, you don't understa...
- Well?
- I got news, big news.
Brown is finished.
The police found Alicia, she's gonna spill her guts to the grand jury.
I said Brown's washed up!
Finished! Off the map.
- You say. That means nothing!
- When Grazzi says, that's something.
There ain't no Grazzi, he's dead!
- Since when?
- Seven years.
I've seen cablegrams.
Brown sent those cablegrams.
Brown killed him.
Brown kept him alive to keep the boys in line.
Why haven't you guys been chaperoning this Miss Lowell dame?
You want to know where she is?
She's helping the police.
Seems like Mr. Brown has lost his charm.
What would you suggest?
Kill him.
Kill him tonight, not tomorrow.
Mr. Brown will be dead soon enough.
The boys will take care of him for his long double-cross.
But, if we do it now, fast... that would save a lot of people a lot of trouble.
We'll be in more solid than ever.
Instead of running around for Brown and wet-nursing all his crazy dames,
I'm gonna show you two guys how to be men.
Start all over.
Slower this time.
We're early.
They said they'd land at 1:00 a.m.
I didn't want to be late, them coming all the way from Denver.
Strange they sent word through you instead of the regular way.
This isn't regular, this is special.
They said they wanted 200 grand in small bills.
I got it right here, but what's the pitch?
- Denver's usually a quiet spot.
- I don't know.
I asked them, but they wouldn't tell me on the phone.
Didn't they give any reason?
No.
What do you think it is?
We'll know soon enough.
Well, Mr. Brown, how do you feel now?
Not so big, huh?
You took my job, you took my hotel.
You thought you could push me right of the earth.
You punk! You accountant, you bookkeeper.
Let him have it. Let him have it now, right now!
Wait a minute!
What's the matter, you fellas gone loony?
I'm McClure. Can't you see me?
This is McClure!
Don't do it, Mango! I'll give you dough!
All the dough I got! 10,000!
20,000! Everything!
No, Fante! Don't do it!
Mr. Brown!
Mr. Brown!
Mr. Brown, tell them not to do it!
I'll do anything you want, I'll go away!
You'll never see me again!
Please, Mr. Brown! Don't just stand there and let 'em kill me!
Please, Mr. Brown.
I don't want to die, tell 'em!
Please tell 'em.
I feel sorry for you, Joe.
So, I'm gonna do you a favor.
You won't hear the bullets.
- Sam.
- Yeah?
Tell the Captain I finished my interrogation.
Miss Lowell.
Are you a policewoman?
No.
Who are you?
My... name is Susan Lowell. I'm... a witness against Mr. Brown.
I'm not.
I can't do it!
Haven't I humiliated myself enough?
No one's done enough while he's still free.
I've been...
Mr. Brown's girl... for the past four years.
He met lots of girls. They were all crazy about him.
I'm not proud of it.
Then, why'd you stay four years?
- Why'd you start?
- I don't know!
No, that's not true. I... I was told, but...
I just wouldn't believe.
Take a look at her, Alicia.
Take a good luck, you can see yourself, ten years ago.
If you had only spoken up then how different... your life would have been.
Because he killed you.
He buried you alive.
Because he's a murderer.
That's all he is, a murderer.
Don't wanna hear it.
He killed Grazzi, didn't he?
You saw him do it, didn't you?
I never said I did!
Besides...
Grazzi deserved to die.
And, what about the girl he had killed three days ago? Did she deserve to die too?
You remember the girl. The girl I told you about at the sanitarium. You remember!
- No, I don't!
- Then I'll refresh your memory. This girl!
Someone he didn't know, never met, never saw.
They took eleven bullets from her body.
The following morning Miss Lowell had breakfast with him.
He ordered bacon and two eggs.
Tell her, Susan!
Tell her how he ate his bacon and eggs while he looked at the papers!
And saw the body of this girl lying in the morgue.
I'll tell whatever I know.
We'll take her to the DA's office for a statement.
Mrs. Brown.
Captain. Captain, this is
Mr. Malloy, an attorney.
I have a writ of habeas corpus for a Mrs. Alicia Brown.
We have no Mrs. Brown here.
This is Mrs. Anna Lee Jackson.
Hello, Alicia.
It's no use, we can't use her.
Well, not every case ends with a promotion, your name in the papers.
McClure's body has been found in the river, shot full of holes.
This is an act of panic!
Mr. Brown is cracking.
Sam, take the headquarters squad, pick up Fante and Mingo.
First Dreyer, Rita, McClure...
They can't have alibis that'll stick for three murders!
Come on, Mingo, lay off that stuff.
Mingo, lay off of that stuff I told you!
Gotta eat something.
I can't swallow anymore salami.
That's all we've got.
Where is Brown, when's he coming?
How long we gonna stay here?
We've been here two days, that's all.
I... I just can't take it anymore, Fante.
I think my thumb's got an infection, it keeps aching worse than a sore tooth.
- If the cops catch us it'll ache worse.
- Cops! What can they prove?
They don't have to prove a thing.
They got three warrants out for us, indictments for three murders.
So, let them indict, they still can't prove...
Can they?
You know how long it would take for three murder trials?
We'd be in jail for three years.
Now relax.
Brown will get us out of town until the heat blows out, then we can come back.
- How do we know we're safe here?
- It's the safest place in the world.
Grazzi built this place in prohibition days, not even the bellhops know it's here.
I'm sour on this town, Fante.
When we get out, let's never come back.
What I'm worried about is getting out of this hotel, the cops will be looking for us in every closet.
- We thought you'd never come!
- Take it easy, boys.
Look, it's now four in the afternoon.
At 5:30 tomorrow morning the cops change shifts in the alley, I'll come for you then.
Did you get us a car?
Everything's arranged.
Just keep your heads and wait.
- I brought you some food.
- I'll go crazy.
You've both been good boys.
There's enough money here to keep care of you for a long time. Divide it even and don't fight over it.
- How much you think?
- Mr. Brown's a generous man.
- I'll tell ya after I count it.
- Give it here.
The police are downstairs.
Bring me another bottle.
Mingo is still alive.
- He can't be.
- He is.
I don't want to go up there again.
There are things in Brown's vault you've got to identify.
Who did this, Mingo? Mingo!
Who did this to you?
Nobody.
Who killed a girl named Rita? Who killed
McClure? Who paid you to do it?
Nobody.
You got third degree burns,
Mingo. You're dying.
I ain't gonna die.
Not you... and not Fante?
Fante...
Don't leave me Fante...
He's dead. Murdered, by whoever tried to kill you.
We haven't got much time, Mingo.
Tell us who did it! Do it for Fante!
He shouldn't of done it...
Fante was my friend...
All right...
I'll tell you.
But not for you...
We played square with him, he shouldn't have hurt Fante.
We haven't got much time, Mingo. Who did it? Who killed the girl in my room?
Who paid you to do it?
Mr. Brown.
Mr. Brown.
- Leonard.
- What?
Sam's been hurt. Shot!
- What? Where... where is he?
- In the hospital, he'll be all right.
But Leonard...
Susan's gone.
Larry. Get his statement, signed.
A man like Brown would have a plan.
Where would he go to make a getaway?
You're a policeman, you find him.
He's not alone, he's got Susan
Lowell with him.
I wouldn't raise a finger to help that girl.
- Let her go through what I've been through.
- She never hurt you, Alicia.
He's the one who put you away, why take it out on her?
Because I hate her.
Her and every other woman who ever had anything to do with him
What have I done to you, why do you hate me?
Oh, I don't!
- I must get...
- Then help me. Help me!
- Tell me where to find him.
- I've got to get back to my flowers.
I'm sure nobody's taken care of them.
Lieutenant.
I don't want to help you...
I don't.
But, I will.
What's keeping that plane? It was supposed to be here an hour ago.
I've kept that stupid pilot on my payroll for years, just for a spot like this.
Why doesn't he come?
Don't try that again.
- I want to be seen.
- Don't try that again!
Why doesn't he come?
I got everything all figured out.
Top to bottom, smooth as silk!
Everything's falling apart!
You can't trust nobody! Nothing!
Come on out, Brown!
You can't get away, Brown!
You can't get away, drop the gun.
Come and get it!
Come on!
- I'm taking you to jail, Mr. Brown.
- No you're not!
You're not taking me to jail!
You'll have to kill me first!
Go ahead, shoot! Go ahead.
Kill me, Copper! Kill me!
- Go ahead! Kill me! Kill me!
- Let's go... Hoodlum.
Let go!
I won't go to jail!
I won't!
Shoot!
- Hey
- yes?
Er, i'm looking for a job.
Who do i see?
oh, you're out of luck, chum.
- Who's won, mate?
- It's on now.
I heard you needed drivers. For ballast.
You a ballast driver?
I'm any kind of a driver.
What difference does it make?
That block, first door. Ask for cartley.
Thank s a lot.
Must be hungry.
Thank s, terry. Ung it anywhere.
Lovely work, jackie-boy. Lucy loves you.
Oh, you're not terry.
Sorry.
See you later, jackie. I thought you were the boy who was mending my typewriter.
I'm looking for mr... cartley?
O oxoc g o
h'm hookirng for a job you'll be lucky.
M o yo o, oo yo o i met a character called legoubin.
Oh, you know leggy?
Ow is hne?
They put a silver plate in his skull.
So i thought there might be a job going.
Why? To get a silver plate put in your skull?
Leggy said there was good money up here.
Well... i'll see what i can do for you.
Yes?
I heard you needed ballast drivers.
You met legoubin, is that right?
Yeahn did he tell you how much he cost us in compensation?
He couldn't handle the loads, not at the speeds we want.
How long have you been driving?
12 years.
- Marny accidernts?
- No.
Yoo o no, oo, o o o licence.
Hm, no endorsements, no convictions for speeding. Why not?
I guess i was never caught.
Name and address of your last employer.
I've been out of the country.
Where?
Around.
I want fast drivers.
50mph touch right round the clock.
- What kind of roads?
- Ad roads. Wet or fine.
- What about the speed limit?
- That's up to you.
If you're caught, you pay your own fine.
So if you don't think you can handle ten tons at that speed, just say so.
What's the money?
We work a bonus system here.
You get seven shillings a load, plus four shillings an hour.
Over what distances?
Ten miles each way.
12 loads a day minimum.
Anything under, you're fired.
It's a pretty rough pace, isn't it?
We've got one man that does 18 runs a day.
What about breakdowns?
You maintain your own lorry at night.
If you have a breakdown, it's your fault.
And er... we like you to keep your vehicle clean. There's a bonus each week for the best-looking truck.
If you've got one left.
You don't like the idea?
I like the money.
An itchy palm doesn't make a good driver.
It needs guts, confidence.
You don't inspire me.
You're looking for a sucker, aren't you, mr cartley?
- Lucy?
- Yes mr carthey?
Phone the shop. Tell ed to bring the spare truck. Usual test run.
- Yes mr carthey
- righnt you'd better not be wasting my time, that's all.
Cartley: Ed, the usual. once over the run.
Roger.
Here, you'll want these.
Have you driven one of this kind before?
I said, have you ever driven one of these before?
Yeah... l've been out of circulation for a little while.
Hop in, then.
What have you been driving?
Oh, this and that.
Oh.
Well, take a tip.
These truck s are light on the trigger.
You don't have to fight 'em the way you're doing.
Loosen up a bit.

Come on, back up. I'll guide you.
Bc o straight on.
D ft a b t now, straighten up.
Full left.
Look at your face oh, them cows.
Yeah, i forgot about the brakes.
Whoa now, you see, we get the stuff from that pit there.
You bring it round on this belt up to the ballast hoppers.
This is the three-eighths -inch hopper.
This is the -inch gravel.
It's the gravel we use.
Yo o o o o no now, get up there and level it off.
The cops like it that way.
Limey, they've let you out today, have they, ed?
Ed: aye doctor's orders that'll keep your tail down. Come on.
Ok.
From now on, it's the run.
I'm timing you.
Give her the gun.
Doesn't come round so friendly now she's loaded, does she?
You've got to keep that needle north of 0.
Every mihe you get above thnat you can reckon on another sixpence an hour.
Drop below it and you're out of a job.
Savvy?
Yeah.
Don't ease up.
- Suppose we meet something?
- Supposing we don't?
Look on the bright side.
Now, keep straight on.
Let the road look after itself.
Good for you.
Whew red chasing johnny.
You didn't have to stop.
Come on, get moving.
We're losing time.
We've got a long way to go yet.
What's the matter?
Who says anything's the matter?
Oh, you're improving.

I put in a good word for you.
Yeahn?

Oh, i said you were a... friend of mine.
Why should you do that?
Do you always know why you do things?

That's yours.
You've got leggy's old truck, number 1.
For luck.
Got your cards with you?
No, o oo i lost them.
Does cartley know that?
No.
Well, we won't tell him.
He's got a suspicious mind.
I'll try and get you some new ones.
Thank s.

Ask at the gate for ma west's.
All the boys stay there.
I'll do that.
Oh, by the way, there's a pull-in across the street where they eat.
Yeah?
Of course, you might get to know some nice local girl and get invited for supper.
You like home cooking?
Yeah, if it's good.

There's the bath.
That's the other place.
No scribbling.
Meals you eat out.
There's a pull-in over the way.
Most of the men go there.
You can have this one.
Good enough for you?
Yeah. How much?
Three shillings a night, sixpence a bath.
Money in advance.
Ok?

This place is a loony bin.

A pity.

You have friends here?
No.
No, thank s.

He's the boss, what we call the pace-setter.
He drives like the devil, marvellous.
He's got truck number one. When you see him coming, keep to the side. That is all i tell you.
Yeah, i passed him on the trial run.
He was going like he'd been fired from a rocket or something.
That is the one.
That is the one.
I'm glad that you have seen him.
Our red.
He's a special friend of yours, too?
I hate the sight of him. Come over to eat.

Funny girl, lucy. The boys like to make out she's, what do you call it...
...a hot number.
You mean she's not?
Oh, lucy's like plenty of people.
Got to make a big impression, you know?
Ecause er... inside, they are...

If he don't, he'll have his front stove in and be off the road for two days.
Hey, red hurry up the sun's fading my paintwork.
Hey, tom. Where you been?
I look for you. You are not in for supper.
I'm working on a sick truck.
Jill, have you got some sandwiches?
I'll see what there is.
Hey, tom, two guys come looking for you.
In a car. They go away.
For me?
Yeah, at ma west's.
Who were they? What did they look like?
I don't know, i don't see them.
Ma west yell upstairs but you are not there.
I see them drive away in a big car from the window.
Gino, are you doing anything tonight?
I wait for lucy now, take her to see the italian picture at the playhouse.
Why? Do you like i should do something for you?
- No, it's ok.
- You tell me... no, o k you know chick keithley?
- Hi.

- Do you know if anybody got the case today?
- The case? Ha, ha fat chance that's all i want to know.
Now, listen, tom. This is crazy.
I see you try to beat red today.
Don't do it. You listen to me.
Don't try it.
So long as he uses the short cut, it's not possible.
Short cut?
Why don't we all use it?
Ecause we're not pazzo like red, that's why.
You know the quarry?
It's very dangerous to drive fast there.
If you drive slow, it's no longer a short cut.
It's a long cut, huh?
Have you tried it?
Yeah, we all try it.
Leggy tried.
He was the last.
We don't go there no more.
Oo ut red only drives a truck, just like you and me.
- Here you are, tom.
- oh, thank s.
Ham and cheese.
We've got some chicken in the refrigerator.
No, this is fine.
- No coffee?
- No. Ye.
- Good night, tom.
- Tom don't try it, huh? You listen to gino.
Jill, are you falling for that guy or something?
I never saw you smile so sweet since we met.
Well, well.
Where have you been? on a picnic?
Yeah. We had champagne.
Well, just fancy.
There was i thinking of inviting you for supper.
Thank s.
- Well, i've got to go back to work.
- Work?
This time of the night? You act as if you're running away from a wife or something.
I'm working on a truck.
There doesn't always have to be a woman in it.
Well, it's usually either that or money, isn't it?
Is it?
Of course i may be wrong, and i'm willing to learn.
Why don't you get in and tell me all about it?
I just love life stories.
Gino's waiting for you in there, remember?
You think i'm flinging myself at you, don't you?
You're giving a pretty fair imitation.
What else is wrong with me?
- You want to know?
- Yeah.
- Hi, muscles.
- Hi, lucy.
Hello, boys.
Hey, lucy.
Tom, what are you doing here?
Lucy, we've got to hurry or we'll miss the picture.
Want to knock off and come with us?
- Lucy won't mind.
- I haven't finished the truck.
- Gino.
- Huh?
I'm going to take that gold cigarette case from red.
You can help me.
Tom, i told you, don't do it.
Red is pazzo.
He don't let anyone take the case.
He's only a... how you say?...a carrot for us donkeys.
Then i'm a donkey.
- Tom.
- Gino wait a minute. Tom, how long have you been driving ballast?
You know how long.
Ecco red's been driving it for 12 years.
He knows all the trick s and you don't.
- So you don't want to help me?
- Tom... all right, i'm with you.
Ut what do you want me to do?
I'll tell you tomorrow morning. Thank s, gino.
Enjoy the picture.
It's like poison in the blood, this thing.
They all get it.
I will try to see he don't get hurt.
- He's a nice boy, huh? You like him?
- He's all right.
He's my friend. You must be nice to him.
Carissima, you look so... you look so pretty tonight.
Come, i drive. Move over.
Gino, i don't feel like a film tonight, especially one of those foreign ones.
Oh, no?
It's too bad. This is the last night for it.
I don't get much chance to...
hnear my owrn peophe tahkirng hey, johnny, come on, hurry up.
Where are we going?
Oh, i don't know.
Let's just go somewhere and have a drink.
All right. Whatever you say.
Yeah, we go and we talk, huh?
You don't know yet, but... i think i've got a surprise for you.
About you and me.
Tonight, i tell you.
Gino... if you really want to go and see the picture... you change your mind again?
Let's go and see the picture.
Whatever you say, carissima.
Come on, harry
- what's your hurry?
- Come on, shake it up.
Anybody would think you're fond of work.
- He work s very hard, doesn't he?
- Yeah.
- Go ahead, boy.
- Yeah
Come on
Red: Come on
Look at that.
Red's getting some of his own medicine.
He'll never get away with it.
Hey, red how do you like your own medicine?
Here, gino, get out of my way
That's how it's going to be, huh?
Hey, gino get on what happened?
It don't matter. Get on.
Gino, are you all right?
Uh-huh. what happened?
Gino, what's the matter with your leg?
Just a shake-up.
It don't matter, i tell you. Get on go on you got a tow-chain?
I've got one.
Yah hey, tom, get going.
You've got to beat him.
- Thank s, fred. How much is that?
- 1 t shillings, miss lucy.
Oh, tom, could you lend me a couple of bob until tomorrow? I'm short.
Yeah, sure.
Thank s a lot.
Thank you very much.
I er... i see on the progress report that you didn't break any records today.
- No. Gino went off the road. I had to help him.
- Is he all right?
He's gone to bed. He doesn't feel too good.
- Does he need anything?
- No, i don't think so.
He hurt his leg, got shaken up.
He wants to sleep it off.
Oh, dear. That means he won't be taking me to the dance tonight.
That's too bad. Very selfish of him.
I didn't mean it like that.
What way did you mean it?
You know, you've got a nasty habit.
- I've got lots. Which one do you mean?
- I could like you.
Look, nobody's asking you to like me.
You're gino's girl.
Ever thought of asking me that?
Look, gino's my pal.
You're not pulling this kind of thing on him.
Don't talk to me like that gino's my friend, too...
- treat him like one.
...and that's all.
You know, the way you act, anyone would think you're the only girl in this town.
Now, get me some fags.
- Is that right, you done 1 t runs today?
- Yeah.
- That's pretty close, eh, red?
- What about it?
Pop's done better than that driving solo.
If you and spaghetti try any more of them stock tactics on me, i'll show you a thing or two you haven't even heard about.
The trouble is, when i teach them, it's the hard way.
Maybe afterwards, you won't be in any condition to use them. You understand me?
Yeah, i think so.
Here, where is old spaghetti, anyway?
He's in bed.
Somebody sideswiped him today.
That's what you two was doing in that ploughed field, is it?
Thought you'd stopped to have a kip.
- If you saw us, why didn't you give us a hand?
- our job's ballast, not breakdowns.
The recovery people don't like it either.
If they heard what you did today, you'd wake up wearing their footprints.
Is somebody going to write to them about it?
- What?
- I said, is somebody... all right, i heard you.
What are you trying to do? E funny?
Do you know... i don't like your attitude.
You've got a chip on your shoulder.
- You think so?
- Yeah.
If i was to knock it off, your head might go with it.
Well, i'm the last man who'd want to walk around without a head.
Huh?
That's better here, get a hold of this, will you?
I've got two jobs here, see?
I'm the pace-setter and the road foreman.
That means i'll be watching you from two directions at once, to beat you on the road and to beat you down when you get out of line.
I'm not looking for trouble.
Unless i'm pushed.
Even if you're pushed.
Hey, tub

Yeah, fine. And you?
So-so.
There's a big brute i want to dance with and he won't ask me.
That's too bad.
What are you trying to prove?
That you're somebody's best friend?
- Now, look.
- Why don't you get it into your thick skull that i'm not anybody's girl and i'm not married
Gino's a sweet guy.
He's in a strange country.
I was just trying to be nice to him.
Do i have to suffer for that?
If you don't like it, that's your problem.
I don't want to be the one that puts him out, that's all.
Come on, let's dance.
- Let's dance.
- I'm waiting for tom.
On second thoughts, i think i will.
I just can't imagine what's happened to my boyfriend.
I sent him for a bottle of coke about half an hour ago.
- Perhaps he thought you said bucket of coke.
- You're very humorous.
Ha, ha tom... don't tell me you don't feel the same way as i do.
What are you trying to do?
I'm human, too, you know.
It's not fair if two people feel the same way about each other.
What's wrong with admitting it?
I suppose you're the type who'd like to see two men shooting it out over you.
As long as you win.
Oh, tom, i don't know what it is.
It's not going to work, lucy.
It's got to work.
You're crazy.
You don't know anything about me.
O ut i'll just love finding out.
- I'm not kidding, this is a nerve test.
- Really?
A test for steady nerves, steady hands.
You'll never drive a truck if you can't hold these like this.
- oh, you're not going to burn me?
- No, no.
- oh, careful
- steady this is where it becomes very important.
You've got to hold still now.
- Are you ready?
- Yeah.
Happy birthday to you happy birthday to you...
oh where have you been?
I was told my old man wanted to see me in the pub opposite.
- Wasn't he there?
- No. I looked in all the pubs to make sure.
That's funny.
Must have been some other ill i was told to look for.
Maybe you invented the story so you could walk off with my girl.
That's right. You've had a good drink, now insult me.
A man of my position, taking care of your girl.
You're lucky i didn't charge you for my time.
Piecework rates ha, ha

Now, look, boy, steady.

Hey, stop the assistant manager.
Quickhy
- what the devil's going on here?
- oh, it's nothing, sir.
A test of strength, huh?
A bet. Nothing.
Nothing? Fighting like animals?
- Gibson, why didn't you stop them?
- Well, you see... you'll pay for this damage, both of you.
You've got your pay, get out.
Go on, get out, all of you.
Once more and it'll be for good.
As for you, you're a foreman.
You're supposed to keep discipline.
I may be a foreman, but i'm not a prison warden.
Think i don't know you just done a spell?
How can i keep discipline if we're hiring convicts?
All right, you know what are you going to do about it?
It's nothing to do with us, sir.
He already paid once for what he done.
He told me.
Oh.
I'll have to check with mr cartley in the morning.
- All right.
- Come on, red.
He can look after himself, that boy, no doubt about it.
Come on, i'm hungry.
- You'd better come and lie down, huh?
- No, i got to work.
This look s bad. You'd better come and get cleaned up, anyway.
- All right, red?
- Yeah.
He kneed me. You saw what happened.
Otherwise i'd have killed him.
Hey.
Ah, well.
Good night...
...mailbags
Hello?
What do you want?
I hear you're eating in the village by yourself these days. How's that?
I like it that way.
I heard what they're saying. Is it true?
Yeah.
It's true.
And i wasn't framed and nobody talked me into anything.
And the judge didn't give me a raw deal.
Happy?
You still have an invitation to eat at my place.
Where's gino?
We're through.
What have you done to him?
I told him the truth.
I told him i liked him but i'm not in love with him.
And i never was.
You had no right to do that.
Whose right is it?
Gino?
Girno are you awake?
Girno gino, i want to talk to you.
Ooo, oo the early's gone, mate. That was it.
9:5, the next.
All right, let's have it.
Don't you characters ever say please?
Here.
Excuse me.
Hello?
- Hs thnat jimmy?
- Tom hello, boy.
Jimmy, if topper or mac or any of the boys come round,
tell them to get in touch with sammy o'dea.
- Sammy o'dea? Are you sure...?
- Leave me ahorne jimmy h krnow whnat h'm doirng tell sammy i'll be round at harry's place about three o'clock, all right?
Ok, tom.
Whatever you say.
Ok, jimmy boy.
Tom, thank god. I've been searching everywhere. Ma west said you'd gone...
- go away.
- You don't understand. It's gino
- will you leave me alone?
- His truck hit a tree and caught fire.
He's very badly burnt.
You've got to come to the hospital now.
What are they doing in there?
Why don't they ever tell you something?
Tom, maybe... maybe i ought to go.
Maybe seeing me will just upset him.
No, lucy.
Look, you've got to go in and see him and tell him what i told you to tell him.
I'll do whatever you want me to.
Ut you've got to stop blaming us.
At least yourself.
- What happened...
- i know what happened.
You don't know everything tom, listen.
This setup is a racket, cartley's and red's.
They don't care how many of you it kills, as long as they can split their extra l200 every week.
Why do you think they specialise in hiring drifters like you and gino who let themselves be hustled for money?
Ut how do they make that kind of money?
We get good pay.
Not ahh of it tom, listen.
The head office pays basic salary for five more drivers than cartley runs.
Red paces a short-handed crew to meet the contract.
The cash for five drivers never even reaches our pay window.
Did you tell gino about this?
Oo, o o o o
- these are friends of his, doctor.
- You can see him.
How... how is he, doc?
If you've got anything to say to him, you'd better say it... now.
It's lucy, sweet.
Lucy and tom.
Amigo.
I was leaving when... i heard what happened.
I was on the railway station. Wasn't i, lucy?
Yes.
Gino, it was you she wanted.
Ahh thne time shne's your girh girno you tell him, lucy.
No... no.
You're right for each other.
E happy... together.
Tom... tom, you take care of my lucy, huh?
And one day... you... you take her to italy.
Va bene?
- No, gino...
- tom i drew them off like we'd planned.
For
foryou to wirn crazy.
You don't even come.
You... you changed the number plates?
They thought you were me?
I was number 1.
Who was it, gino? Was it red?
Gino wait outside a moment, will you, please?
They...
oh oh, my god
Eddie, collect a recovery truck and get out there right away.
Write-off or no write-off, she'll be good for some spares.
- ok.
- Cooper isn't this red's truck? What's he doing in?
An oil refill. He's losing it somewhere.
- I'll fix it tonight.
- All right.
He'll be out in a minute.
Lucy what are you doing in here? Get off my desk.
Gino's dead.
Oh, that's bad luck.
You... you helped to kill him, cartley.
I'll pretend i didn't hear that. I think you'd better go before you say something you might regret.
About the money you and red have been grabbing by running us short-handed?
I know all about it.
Oh.
You do, now? I see.
Well, if you know so much, why don't you go and report it somewhere?
Ecause you'd only get nicked.
That's too good for you.
Why, you cheap lag you think that i don't know that you've been driving without a licence?
How long do you think you'll stay out, with your record?
Then we'll do time together.
And i'm used to it.
I'm giving you a week to pay, cartley, one week.
- Listen, where are you going?
- You want loads, cartley, you'll get them ut from now on, we're getting all the money that's coming to us.
Every penny of it.
Listen yateley now, listen. Wait a minute, damn you.
Now, look here, you're a clever boy and a grand driver. I've seen it all along.
I can get you a corner on this.
It'll double your wages, a lot better than a bonus.
Tom, listen listen, tom, i can make things much easier for you here.
Ok.
Then i'll take over number 1.
It's better than that junk you gave me.
All right, all right.
If you want it that way, it can be arranged.
Ut let's talk about it first.
No, c o i don't want you and red for partners.
You're not my type.
Oh, now you're being unreasonable.
Tell red i'm after him.
Tell him i haven't any proof yet that he smashed gino.
Ut one day, he'll show his hand.
And i'll smash him.
Hey hey what's that rat doing on my truck?
Why didn't you stop him?
Stop him? Huh he knows.
That slut must have told him.
He's taken your job and your truck.
He says he's going to get you for killing rossi.
- He is, eh? Rossi's dead?
- Rossi's dead.
Yes, and we're in big trouble.
You'd better get after him quick. Now.
There's number.
- How about you?
- I'll back you up.
You will? You're coming with me.
I want a witness in case anything goes wrong.
- I'm sick of taking all the risk s.
- Don't be a fool.
I said you're coming.
That means you're coming.
Red. Red all right
What are you going this way for?
I know what i'm doing.
Ut he's gone to the ballast pit.
Where does he go after that?
What are you doing with number 1?
I am number 1.
- Ack?
- We're here.
He's taking it slow.
- Tom came in with your jeep.
- Is he in the office?
No, he went back out on the run.
I think he's in for it, too.
- He took number 1 truck.
- What?
Red and mr cartley have gone after him in number.
Oh, no
open the gate, harry.
- Red.
- S sh
Red... maybe we ought to... huh?
This is cold blood. It's murder.
And i don't want any part of it
- let me get out of here
- oh, sit tight sit tight.
- You've got him
- no, we haven't.

Janet
Oh David,David
Janet
What? What on earth is the matter? What's happened?
Oh,David,it's terrible it's all like going mad
What is Janet? Aren't you well?
For heaven's sake,please,what is it?
What happened to you?
Where have you been?
Where I've been? In the office of course, where do you think I've been
But last night and all of today
But Janet,darling
I never saw you like this before
If you didn't feel well why didn't you ring me at the bank
You only had to phone and
I'd come straight home
I've been in torment all day and all last night
I thought I was going mad
All last night?
What do you mean all last night?
And you didn't come home
Janet,dear
Look,look at the clock up there, it's just gone seven
I'm always home at seven every evening
There is nothing for you to be anxious about
Just been an ordinary day,dear, just like any other Monday
Today is Tuesday
Monday,darling
It's Tuesday,David
You are tired,you've got confused
And do you know which day of the week it is?
Yesterday was Sunday,don't you remember?
We worked in the garden,you pulled the rose tree,I cut the lawn
Ah
I'm just going to make you a nice cup of tea
Do you know? You probably had an afternoon nap and dreamt that I didn't come home
Well,I did
Everything is all right
David
Just a moment
Evening paper you brought in
Look,Tuesday
Well,that's extraordinary
And let's look at this morning's paper
This morning's paper isn't here because I took it with me to the office, now you know I always take it with me,Janet
You didn't take the morning paper because you weren't here to take it
Tuesday,the 27th,you see?
We've always understood one and another,David
And if you suddenly felt you wanted to go off and be on your own for a while
Well,it's perfectly all right and
I should have understood but why couldn't you telephone and tell me when coming home
No,something,I don't understand happened,Janet
You,you must give me time to think because I'm sure that some quite simple explanation and it will come in a minute
Anyone at the bank can tell you I've been there all day
You've not been at the bank all day
I rang the manager
I was getting supper ready at seven o'clock last night like I always do
When you didn't come in I thought you missed the train at Cannon Street or the train was late for some reason
But when 8 o'clock came and I was terribly worried because you always telephone if you are going to be late
I thought you had an accident
By nine o'clock I was so dreadfully anxious so I rang up the police
You rang up the police?
What did you expect me to do did you expect me to lock up the house and go to bed as if nothing had happened
Then the Sgt.on duty said he'd
Enquire at the hospitals and see if anyone been brought in
I sat up here all night waiting and listening
And then when the bank was open I rang the manager
He said you hadn't come in this morning but you had left last night as usual at 5 o'clock
Tell me you left at 6,David, you said you always leave at 6
That's right,Janet,so I do at 6
That's why I asked him again because it surprised me but he repeated it that you always leave at 5
He must have made a mistake or you misunderstood him
He always leaves at 5,speaking of himself when he said that
About 12 he rang up again and said you still hadn't come in
Since then I've just been sitting here for hours and hours and thought I was going mad
Then you walk in,David, as if nothing had happened and say that I dreamt it all
All I can tell you,unless I've taken leave of my senses
I've been at the bank all day and done the usual work I always do on Monday
Look at my clothes
Do I look as if I was wandering about all Monday night?
Where could I've washed and shaved eh?
After all do I look any different from what I look every evening when I come in from the office?
Coming up the road just now
Thinking on the ordinary every day things I think about on my way home then
Tulips to put in around the house next Sunday the accounts of the social club to get ready for the general meeting next month
Our evening at the pictures on Wednesday
You know you are angry when I say you must have had a nap and dreamt it,and what else can I think?
These papers I don't understand
But there must be some explanation, some quite simple explanation
Hello
Oh,yes,Mr Cooper
Yes,he's just come in
No,he's quite all right
I don't know is
I'll tell him
He says you've not been at the bank all day
He'd like to speak to you
Hello,good evening,Mr Cooper,Sir
Yes,I'm quite all right
I don't know
I'm afraid there isn't anything I can tell you now
I'll be at the bank early at a quarter to 9
And I come and see you in your office
Yes,yes
Good night,Sir
Look
There's Dr Sparling calling on the Preston's
I noticed he wasn't on the train this morning
I wonder if anything is wrong
My husband is upstairs lying down,doctor
-I'll take you up to him
-Thank you
You definitely think he is ill?
I don't know,I do not know any more than I told you on the phone
He came home looking quite well and cheerful
He was perfectly all right until I showed him the newspaper
Then he refused to believe it
Then the bank manager rang up
He believed it then
What else could he do?
Yes but he couldn't hoped to walk in like that and make you believe that nothing had happened unless he also believed it
I know,he such an honest man,doctor
I don't think he'd ever told a lie in his life
I think he was absolutely genuine when he seemed surprised
Yet
I had a feeling he was concealing something
-Oh
-Well,a small thing
But
He said he left his office last night at 6 o'clock
That he always leaves at 6 but
The bank manager on the phone said he leaves at 5 regularly every night
That hardly explains in any way the 24 hours
Did you ask him about it?
Yes,he said it was a mistake
-He was so certain I must believe him
-Of course
You don't know us very well,doctor
But I think you ought to know we are absolutely happy together
I'm sure of that
That's what made it hard
But I did try to make him realize that I'd understand perfectly if he just wanted to go off and be on his own for a while
What did he say to that?
He swore that there was nothing, there was absolutely nothing
-Then I think you should accept that
-Yes,I do
Because I am certain he always has told me the truth all the years we've been together
Well,if you'll tell him I'm here
-David?
-Hmm
Dr Sparling is here
Oh
Good evening
Good evening,doctor
It's quite some time since we last met,you remember,the social club dance
Yes,at Christmas
Quite a good crowd that evening
That's keep you pretty busy being treasurer of a big club like that
Oh,it does,it takes a good deal of time I enjoy it
How many members have you got?
Over 300 this year
-Oh,it's a big thing
-Yes
It is,I hoped to start it 10 years ago with the gang was 15 members
Gone ahead fast the past few years
Well,you're looking very well
I feel well,perfectly well
My wife told you on the phone what happened
Yes,she told me everything you told her
It was so queer,doctor
Like a night mare
Yes
Now look,I don't want you to take this in the wrong way
But
You do realize that anything you say to me is in strictest confidence
And if there's anything you don't want Mrs Preston to know
Oh,I can assure you definitely of that,doctor
I can tell you no more than I told my wife,I told her everything I know
From the moment I left home yesterday morning until the moment I arrived back here this evening
I was absolutely convinced that I spent an ordinary day at the bank
There's only one of the thing that could have happened
You must have had a lapse of memory that apparently lasted a full 24 hours
A lapse of memory?
Where could I've been for 24 hours?
That's what we got to try to find out
You've been quite well recently
I mean no headaches or unaccountable restlessness or sleeplessness
No I don't think so
Nothing seriously worrying you?
Nothing to account for all this
Was there anything unusual in your journey to London yesterday?
No
Arrived at the station a few minutes before the train came in met Major Watson on the platform, the President of our social club
We travelled up together talked of club affairs new tennis courts we are laying down at the general meeting next month remember it all perfectly
Nothing happened at the bank because the manager rang up and told my wife I've been there all day
And you
And you left the bank at
-Your usual time
-Yes
Yes
You did say anything I told you would be in confidence
Absolutely I give you my word on that
Well,there is one little thing
There's a harmless trivial little thing that couldn't possibly have anything to do with all this
But
You
You understand my wife and
I are perfectly happy together
Yes,of course
Anyone has little things they like and dislike
My wife doesn't like alcoholic drinks
She's not intolerance,she's not a temperance fanatic or anything like that
But I respect her wishes and that and
I don't have them in the house anyway
I drink very little but like a good many other men
I enjoy a glass of sherry in the evening when I finish my day's works
So do I,why not?
There's been a habit of mine for some while to call in a little place and have a glass of sherry on my way to the station every evening
It was just after the war,we're short of staff I was working every evening until 7
At 6 o'clock I go out have my drink and then go back and finish my work
A little pub in a side street near the bank kept by a brother and two sisters
Very nice people
Joe's is about forty I suppose
Ellen about the same age
The younger sister she is much the younger under 30 I imagine
Yes,I know what you are thinking,doctor
Oh,not at all,why should I?
She's perfectly harmless she's full of fun and I like her
But we sit there passing the time of the day having a joke or so while I was drinking my sherry
Well,when this late work finished
I was free to leave the bank at the usual hour at 5
I was rather disappointed to think this pleasant half hour had to end
It didn't open until 6 of course I could scarcely hang about for an hour waiting
So you went around to the side door
I used to do that at a place in
Winchester during the war
They live over the premises
It was rather foolishly of me not to tell my wife but you see I
I just let her think I still worked at the bank until 6
Then walked straight to the station for my train home
Well,I don't think there's anything very terrible in that
I imagine a lot of other city men do the same
But why didn't you tell your wife?
Why I didn't tell her
I think it was mainly I didn't want her to to feel she was depriving me of anything
I could easily have at home
She would have insisted having the sherry in
I didn't want it in I like it having it where I do at that time of the evening
-Naturally
-If I was to suddenly tell her now that I've been doing this she might think it was somehow connected with what's happened
I'm sure it isn't
You went there as usual last night?
Oh,yes arrived just after 5 left in good time to catch my train
Nothing unusual happened
Nothing,had my sherry we all went into the salon bar and played a game of dart
I remember 6 o'clock striking from St Paul as I said good night
Well,it all boils down to the next hour because
Normally you'd been at home at 7
Can you remember how you were feeling on the walk to the station
Were there any incidents on the way?
Really happy and contended as I always do walking to the station after my sherry
You didn't have more than usual to drink that evening by any chance?
I'm certain of that two is the limit they never press me
I'm very much a creature of habit,doctor you know,one cup of tea for breakfast and exactly one half cup more things like that
And you arrived at Cannon street in good time for your train
Yes
Yes
This one curious little thing
I can't even remember it if I wasn't searching around for something out of the ordinary
I do remember a curious feeling as I walked on to the station and looked up at the big clock
Can't really describe it a sort of vague and uncertain kind of feeling
I was staring very hard at the clock
So hard I can see it now quite distinctive
Big white face the black hands pointing to quarter past six
I remember
Dazed,uncertain feeling when I went for my train
I had to think before I could
 recollect the number of the platform
Do you remember the journey home?
Not absolutely
I was wondering if you were finished
Oh yes,yes,come in Mrs Preston,do
I'm not disturbing you?
No,no,no at all
Come in Janet
Well,I can promise you one thing,Mrs Preston
Your husband's quite well in himself
A case of lost memory is disturbing,naturally,but
There's no need to be alarmed
What were you doing during the war,Mr Preston?
I was at the bank as usual I was an air raid warden down here
Oh,well,you went through some bad bombings
Oh yes we were right in
Flybomb Alley here,you know
Can you remember any specially bad experience?
Well,there was that one at Aintshire Road,David
Oh yes, had a close (?) squeak that night
A fly bomb came down in a piece of wasteland behind the houses
I was more than hundred yards off the time so the blast was pretty bad
I wasn't hit by anything but I was deaf in this ear for some days
Did you have medical attention?
No,I don't think it's necessary I felt all right but the deafness that soon wore off
You know,a shock of that kind can play funny tricks sometimes
Oh,thank you
We've had a lot of it since the war
Yes
If only I could remember when it happened
And what I was dong all those hours
We accounted for the whole of yesterday until Mr Preston arrived at Cannon
Street Station on his way home
Do you mean that he lost his memory at Cannon Street last night and stayed then until this evening?
It is possible
But wouldn't the station master or somebody have done something?
You've no dim recollection of anything like that?
None whatever
I think that's possibly what happened
Your memory began to go wrong at Cannon Street
You just wandered aimlessly away
Yes,and where to? For all those hours,the whole night?
Well,that's something we don't know at present
In the morning after a good night's sleep,you may remember some little things that'll piece the rest together
The main thing is you're home
Fit and well and no harm done
Naturally you feel disturbed and worried
I'll send you around something to settle you down when you go to bed
Oh,I never take things like that
Oh,it'll be quite harmless, just if you can't sleep
And I look in at about 10 in the morning
But I leave for the bank before eight
I'd promised that manager
I'd be there early
I wouldn't go to the bank tomorrow morning ,if I were you
Have a quiet day
And don't worry
You know,doctor
There's one thing that's bothering me a bit about the bank,doctor
You know it's practically certain I shall be manager of the Eastbourne branch next year
It's a good branch and a good appointment but it may affect things very much if the director hear about this,you know
They are queer people,those directors
Supposing I said there was some misunderstanding
If I said I spent the night with friends and my wife forgot
Or I forgot to tell her
Oh,that's entirely up to you
My only concern if I'm asked for a certificate
Oh,you won't be,I'll ring the manager in the morning and explain
-I'm sure you'll support me in that,Janet?
-I'll do whatever you think right,David
I can't tell you how grateful I am for the way you helped me
You know a lot of doctors that'll talk to lot of big words and frighten me out of my life
No need of that,I'm sure
-Still,if you'd like to see a specialist
-Good heavens,no
Hello,Preston,I'm just coming over to see you
Oh,good evening,you know Major Watson, doctor,the President of our social club
-How are you?
-Not too bad
I met you at our Christmas dance,didn't I?
Yes,that's right I came as a guest
-Have you recruited him as a member?
-No,not yet but I think he'd ought to be
Fine,you put him up,Preston,I'll second him it's the best club for miles around bridge,billiard, everything, including a monthly Brains Trust
We've just been running a sweepstake on the
Cambridgeshire,we've collected over 500 £
That's quite a lot of money, well,good bye,Mr Preston
Good bye,good bye doctor
-Nice chap?
-Yes,quite a good fellow
I was thinking only the other day we ought to rope in up a few doctors
We've got a couple of chemists but doctors give a club more class
What's he here for? Aren't you well?
Oh,nothing much just a
Just a touch of tummy trouble that's all
I wondered why you weren't
 on the train this morning
You've been home all day?
No,as a matter of fact,I'd spend the night with friends
Something I had for supper disagreed with me
I decided to spend the night with them
I've only just got home
You say you spent the night with friends?
Yes
You mean you slept the night with them?
Well,I've just told you
Some old friends on the other side of London
I go there now and then
I came to see you about that sweepstake money
You went to the club last night and took it away,didn't you?
Robinson,the club steward said you were there in the office to 10 o'clock
You must be pretty late for that dinner of those friends of yours on the other side of London if you didn't leave the club until after 10
You?
You did go the club and take that money,didn't you?
I told you I spent the night with friends
Do you mean to tell me you didn't go to the club at all?
No
Good Lord
What did the club steward tell you?
Whatever he told me was a lie.The fellow is a dirty rotten low-down thief
What did he tell you?
He came round to my house last night to bring me the keys because he was going away on holidays
He told me he put out all his lights but just as he was leaving he saw a light in the office
He went in to put that out
He found you there at the safe
He saw that sweepstakes money all those bundles of notes on a chair
He said that you told him you weren't altogether too happy about leaving all that money in that small safe
But then you were going to take care of it until you paid out the prizes
Do you mean to tell me that that's a lie?
I've told you I wasn't there
The dirty rotten thief had it all so smooth. Have you ever doubted him?
He told me you acted oddly lost your temper and told him to go out and mind his own business
Well,you never liked that fellow I never liked him either
You see what he did?
He wanted to make me wonder about you where the money had gone and give him more time to get away
And the scoundrel had a clear day start
Are you certain the money is gone?
Certain? Of course I'm certain,515£ of club money,members money
And the draw tomorrow night
We'd better get the police on that at once
Where is your phone?
Major Watson,don't do anything tonight
Don't do anything tonight,what do you mean?
There may be some mistake, some misunderstanding
-What kind of mistake the money is gone
-It may not have been stolen
Well,it beats me,you never liked the fellow,you never trusted him
And now he's under doubt(?) you're only trying to cover him up
I'm tired tonight,Major,I've had a bad day
-I'm not well
-Well?
Do you think I'm well after all this?
What are we going to tell the subcommittee tomorrow night?
Will you wait until the morning,
Major? Let's decide then
And give him another clear night to get away?
It's very serious to accuse a man until we are certain
I'm the club treasurer I feel myself responsible
I don't understand you
I thought you were a businessman
-I'll ring you first thing in the morning
-I'll probably ring you before you ring me
It's terrible,David,isn't it?
And how did you know?
Why? Mrs Thompson just called in,she told me
But how did she know?
I think it's all over the town
What's all over the town?
Didn't Major Watson come to tell you?
Do you mean to say he hadn't heard?
They found Robinson,the club steward this evening
In that little wood by the pond on the common
He's been murdered
Murdered?
Hello? Is that the police station?
This is Major Watson, president of the Social Club
I wish to report a robbery of 515 £
What do you say?
Robinson? Murdered?
Right,take him away
Up,away
Drive away,driver
How much have you roped off?
About twenty square yards,Sir
I don't suppose they find much tonight
We might as well have a look round
I suppose these are the old dugouts something
Yes,Sir
Tell the photographer I want those plates first thing in the morning,will you?
Yes,Sir
They had a good look around,Sir but they've found nothing yet
The ground's covered with leaves
However,we'd better leave this to the morning
Oh,tell the river police to drag the pond,will you?
Right,Sir
And see that you have plenty of men on duty
Otherwise you may have the whole neighbourhood swarming in
Good night,Sir
Hart Road,please,Jim
-Good morning,Mrs Preston?
-Yes,that's right
I'm Inspector Hemingway.I rung up just now and had a word with your husband
-Yes,that's right,will you come in
-Thanks
Thank you
He's in here
Good morning,Mr Preston
I'm Inspector Hemingway I spoke to you on the phone just now
Yes,that's right
-Will you,will you sit down?
-Thank you
Lovely show of those Japanese
 chrysanthemum you've got out there
Yes,my wife goes in for those
How do you get get such fine colours?
Manage to get a little good manure from the riding school
Not much of the good old stable stuff about these days
No I'm afraid not
You know down my road the milkman still calls with the horse and cart
All of people with gardens waits with a pair of shovels hoping for a bit of luck
That's one way
The trouble is the horses are so regular in their habits the same man gets it every morning
It's a bit of shock for you this Robinson business
Yes
You're the treasurer over at the club aren't you?
-Yes,that's right
-I suppose you knew him pretty well
Well,only as club steward, he'll bring me the books
I check them over and put the money in the bank
Were they always in order? No trouble?
None,whatever
He wasn't a good book keeper there were small mistakes in additions but nothing deliberate
Did he do everything in the club?
There's a woman does the cooking and a little fellow that worked in the kitchen at weekends
But he was at the hospital during the week,
Robinson was practically on his own
-What's the name of the cook?
-Mrs Bridget
And the other chap?
I can't remember
Well,I suppose I can contact him at the hospital
Oh,yes,of course
Major Watson told me a rather queer story
-I think he saw you last night
-Yes,he came in
From his account,this fellow Robinson had some idea of involving you,Mr Preston
Yes,Major Watson told me
Major Watson says that you spent that night with friends on the other side of London
It's only a matter of routine but if you just give me the name and the address of the people you stayed with that night,
I can clear that up right away
I spent the night with an old friend of mine
His name is Wainwright
Wainwright,will you give me his address please
17 Manor Road Wembley
Well,I won't keep you now,Mr Preston
You'll be needed at the inquest
Because the story which Robinson told
Major Watson will come in as evidence
But we'll let you know in good time
It's a rather bad luck on your club
Were you insured against this kind of robbery?
No,they weren't insured money
Oh,let's hope we get it back for you
I suppose you couldn't
Spare a few of those chrysanthemums?
Yes,of course
My wife loves a bit of colour around the flat,we haven't got a garden,worse luck
I'll ask my wife to cut you some
You will? Oh,thanks very much
Well, I'll drop by my own and pick them up on my way home,if I may
Around about 5 o'clock
-I'll see that they are ready for you
-Fine
We'll keep you informed,good bye Mr Preston
Good bye
What did he say?
I'll tell you in a minute
Who are you ringing up?
Janet,I can't talk if you're here
The inspector asked for some chrysanthemums
Could you go out and pick them for him,please?
-Then everything is all right
-Yes,yes,it is
Hello,hello
Is that Wembley 7294?
Yes,I want to speak to Mr Wainwright,please
What?
When did he go away?
Last Saturday?
But
I must get in touch with him,it's very urgent
Yeah
Sure,you know what hotel he's staying at?
I see
I see
No,no message
Thank you
Did he say what colour he likes?
-Colours? What colour?
-You said the inspector wanted some chrysanthemums
It doesn't matter now
But David,only a moment ago you told me
Just a few of each
That'll be all right
Wherever are you going? The doctor will be here in an hour
No,I'll just go round to the surgery
I think a little walk would do me good
Oh,Mr Preston,come in,come in
How are you this morning?
All right
I was just coming round to see you
You know what's happened?
No,what?
It's in your paper there
Oh,you mean that murder on Monday
Your club steward,it's quite close to where I live
Well
Have you been able to piece things together at all?
No
No small thought on memory that might help us
No,there's nothing
Supposing we try running through things again,quietly and slowly
-And see whether..
-Oh,why don't you say
What's in your mind and done with it
I know exactly what you are thinking
Every imaginatively person who suffers a lapse of memory
Tries to fill in the gaps with all kind of things
If you hadn't read about this affair you'd found something else, a burglary or something
And let your mind play on that, you wouldn't be human if you didn't
But it's absurd to connect this matter of the club steward with yourself
Why is it absurd?
When there's a person who suffers a lost memory still retains his own character,Mr Preston
If a criminal lunatic lost his memory he'll probably continue behave like a criminal lunatic
But a normal honest man will continue to behave normally and honestly
Supposing a normal honest man
Hated somebody,wouldn't he go on hating that person subconsciously after his memory had gone?
But you didn't hate this man Robinson
I did hate him
But why?
How can I explain?
From the very moment he came up to the club committee I disliked him
I opposed his appointment because of that
He surely found out that I opposed him
What made you do that?
How could I tell
I never had bad feelings of any man in my life except for him
I just disliked his type, his big fat body,pale flabby face
Most of all I disliked his eyes
The way he looked at me
I don't suppose I had any good grounds for opposing his appointment
But
Did he prove himself to be the wrong man?
He did his work well enough
The more I saw him the more I loathed him
I used to look forward to going to the club after he came
It was spoilt for me
He had his eyes on me every time he came into the room
I thought something evil and horrible about him
I knew he'd glory in hurting me if he could and was waiting for a chance
Gradually I
I got the feelings somehow he
He was fated to ruin and destroy me
You see,that's why I told you to stay at home today and rest
Imaginations can play cruel tricks
And you thought I'm suddenly imaging all this,do you?
For months now I wake up in the nights fuming of what he'd done to destroy my pleasure in the club
Wondering what I could do to get rid of him
But you got to be sensible
You never in your wildest moments thought of murdering him?
Naturally I didn't
Well,then you're not very likely to murder him on Monday night
Do you know what happened on Monday night?
A few hours before he died,he told
Major Watson he saw me in the club
Taking the sweepstakes money
But you can prove that you didn't do that either
How can I?
By common sense and reason
If a man was desperately in need of money then it's possible he might be drawn subconsciously to a place where money could be found
That is possible
Yes,if he definitely had theft in mind before his lapse of memory
If you are going to tell me you've been calmly planning robbery and murder for the past few weeks then,I don't believe you and I never shall
And what's more I can't help you because you're making no attempt to help yourself
When you left me last night I thought I'd wake up this morning with everything clear
When I heard about this murder
I didn't dare sleep
All night long I never lost the sound of the rain trickling outside the trains and the traffic in the distance
It began to come
In little bits at first as you said it would
Queer little disconnected things
The chestnut tree,some thin strips of metal tinkling like bells
A man's feet rustling in dry leaves
One half of my brain fought against it the other side went probing on
Suddenly
I remembered
I was on a common
I saw every detail,the moon was shining
The wind was rattling those little strips of metal men hang around their allotments to scare the birds
I saw the pond where the children paddled and sailed their boats a long line of chestnut trees with the dry leaves coming down
The two old dugouts under the mount
I was walking along the
(?) path beside the pond
In a desperate kind of fear
This man Robinson was following me in the dark
Creeping along like a fat grey slug
I went between the trees,down the steps of one of the dugouts
There was a pile of sandbags in one corner and some squares of that tarred roofing stuff
I laid the money under the square and I covered it over with sand
All around I could hear him out there roaming about in the dead leaves
I came up the steps
And looked out
I could just see him going into the wood
And I followed him
When did you first know he'd been murdered?
Last night when somebody called on my wife
Did this person tell your wife how it was committed?
Didn't ask
How did it happen when it came back last night?
I followed him into the wood
I tore my mind away from it,it was too horrible
You see perfect autosuggestion
Now doesn't that make you see reason?
You dreamt what you were told by your wife
Oh,I wish I could believe you
You added to that dream what Major
Watson told you about the money and you woke up when your information about the details came to an end
What makes you so certain I dreamt it?
Because it's the sort of dream a man would have after your experience
You told me my memory might come back you can't be so certain
I can only weigh the two things together and go for the one that's more probable
When anyone would ask me point blank if I remember anything of those last hours would anyone in authority would to ask me on oath would it be honest to still say that I remember nothing?
In your place I certainly would
If you were sure then it might be different but you are not
I give myself the benefit of a doubt the Law does that in any case
Whether,it's honest I don't know,but that's what I'll do if I were questioned
I have been questioned
-When?
-Just now
Inspector came round to my house wanted to know where I was on Monday night
But you didn't tell him all this?
No,I didn't
Did you mention this loss of memory?
No,I didn't do that,you see
I told Major Watson I spent that night with friends
He told the police they wanted to know the name and address the people I stayed with
I couldn't very well go back on what I told the Major
I'm afraid I wasn't very honest,it happened so quickly,I hadn't time to think
What did you say?
I told him I spent Monday night in
Wembley with a man named Wainwright
He's my best and oldest friend and would do anything for me as I would for him
I knew if I rang him up and told him that I'd told the police I spent the night with him he'll say that I did without question
Did he agree to that?
The caretaker answered the telephone
Wainwright went on a motoring tour on Saturday morning
He spent the weekend in the Lake District
He's somewhere in Scotland now
I might have known something like that would happen
I'm afraid it's rather serious
I'm sorry to drag you into a thing like this,doctor
You're a busy man you got a lot of people you ought to see
What do you think I ought to do,if I go to the inspector,what am I to tell him?
I wouldn't tell him anything if I were you
Until I've had proper advice
In what way?
Well,I know the first thing I'd do myself would be to get a good solicitor
I haven't got a solicitor, do you know of one?
I'm going to take you round to mine
Mr Petherbridge
It's a thousand pities that you felt it necessary to mislead the police with an untrue statement,Mr Preston
I was just going to explain
Do you realize that you ask this friend of yours to commit perjury?
Are you for me or against me in this,Mr Petherbridge?
I'm afraid Mr Preston is giving the police a tremendous advantage in making a false statement of his whereabouts on Monday night
I think there are something else in Mr Preston's mind
I told you that he had some impressions last night and personally I think it was a dream
-You mean concerning this money?
-Yes
Well,surely it's easy enough to find out about that
Simply by going to the dugout and seeing whether the money is there
I think it would be most unwise, the police would have men on duty
We should be inviting suspicion
Yes,but it would settle Mr Preston's mind
That's not the important issue
A dream which turns out to be imaginary is not proof of a man's innocence
Material witness and definite proofs are the factors that really count
Excuse me
You won't find the money there,you know
We are not looking for it here,Sir
It's the man we are after, he was in that office on Monday night
Anyone who takes the money doesn't matter from the way you're going on
Do you realize there's a draw tomorrow night and the race three days later?
It won't effect the race,will it,Sir?
I mean they'll still have that
If we don't get that money back, heaven knows what's going to happen
Ah,inspector there you are
Any news of that money?
No.I'm afraid not yet,Major
-Where are..
-Inspector
There's
There's something rather funny I want to show you
Do you,do you see?
This safe wasn't opened with a key at all
It was broken open
Yes,I see it was
Do you know,last night I could have sworn that Robinson did this
Did Robinson had a key to the safe?
No,but Preston did
What are you trying to say,Major?
Excuse me
You see
Major Watson speaking
Who? Oh Yes
-Wembley Police Station for you,Inspector
-Thank you
Inspector Hemingway here
Yes,that's right
Yes?
Oh,I see
All right,thank you
I am going to see Mr Preston now
What about?
Only some flowers he promised to let me have
Is there any personal property that you can't account for?
Any small things that you had with you before you lost your memory you're missing now?
Yes,his gloves and the handkerchief
I'm not certain about the handkerchief
You see he always carries two
One folded in his breast pocket and the other one tucked in his sleeve
Well,the one in the pocket was there,
I'm not certain I had the other
I think that I did
Can you describe the gloves?
Brown leather almost new
-Had the handkerchief your name on it?
-My initials
D H P
He may have left them in the train
Yes,we must hope that he did
Well,Mr Preston,I suggest that we communicate with the police at once and tell them that you wish to correct your previous statement
You will then recount to them every detail that actually happened
But nothing at all about what you may have recollected or imagined since
What will they do then?
I don't know depends on the extent on which they accept your husband's statement that he did actually lose his memory
But he did,we know that
We have to prove it,Mrs Preston
We must engage the best possible counsel to defend you
What will that cost?
In a difficult case like this you will need an outstanding man
If a person is suspected of stealing can show himself to be in good circumstances,he's no urgent need of money
Then his position in the eyes of the jury is far stronger
But I still can't see what you mean
I mean that an important counsel commands a larger fee than a lesser man
If you can show yourself in a position to meet that fee then automatically you show the jury,you're unlikely to have stolen out of urgent need
But what would that cost?
Well,I should say that 500 guineas would provide for everything
I'm sorry to disturb you again,
Mrs Preston,is your husband in?
-Oh,yes,he's in here
-Thank you
Good morning,Inspector
Good morning,Mr Petherbridge
Mr Preston has asked me to act for him
Well,Mr Preston,I expect you know why I called again
Yes
Our Wembley station called at Mr Wainwright's house
Yes,I know
Mr Wainwright went on his holiday on Saturday
Yes
Well,if you knew that Mr
Wainwright had gone away
I'm wondering why you told me you stayed with him
I didn't know
You mean you didn't know when you told me this morning?
That is correct
-If you excuse me Inspector I think
-It's quite all right,Mr Petherbridge
Well,Mr Preston,I wonder if you don't mind just walking around to the station with me
You know it's only our routine to take down a statement from everybody anyway concerning an affair of this kind
It's just a formality
I've taken a statement from
Major Watson this morning and will be taking a quite a few more
I'll do anything you need
It won't take long
-Shall I be coming back?
-Yes,of course
Will it be all right if I come too?
You wish to make a statement,Mrs Preston?
No,no but I think my husband would like me to be there,wouldn't you dear,I mean?
I'd like to wait for you
I think I'd stay here,Janet
There's no need
I imaging you were wearing what you might call a city suit on Monday?
Yes
Would you mind if we take that along with us?
And the shoes you were wearing?
Just another bit of routine they make us do
-If you need them
-I'll fetch them
I'll come along up and help pack them
I think I'll go up too
No
Mr Petherbridge
If I tell you something will you promise not to say a word about it to my husband?
Certainly
I think it'll help you to understand,you see
For a long time now he's been terribly need of money
It's not his fault,it was his father
It all began years ago his father travelled round collecting money for his firm
And then one day
Well,he couldn't pay,I think it was betting
But David undertook to pay back every penny his father had taken
He borrowed some from friends and the rest he got from a moneylender
Gradually he paid back all his friends but the moneylender kept adding expenses and things and until now it's nearly double what it was to begin with
He wrote a horrible letter saying unless all the money was paid back he'll tell David's bank
Well,now
I have a little money of my own,an annuity
I wanted to sell it there and then but David was furious
I think it was the first real quarrel we ever had
He said nothing would make him use my money
I see
If the police happen to ask for any statement,Mrs Preston
I think you'd be well advised to say nothing whatever about this
Oh,yes,but you do see that we must pay counsel's fee without David knowing
He could never hope to pay them himself
He'd be rather not be defended at all if he knew it came from my money
Yes I quite see that, you'll be sure personally
I shall take no advantage of your difficulties,Mrs Preston
Thank you
Nice piece of material isn't it?
-Yes
-Pre war,isn't it?
Yes
You haven't cleaned the suit since Monday?
No
Oh,and now the shoes you were wearing
Oh
Stepped into some mud,didn't you?
Mud?
I don't remember
It's all right,thank you,Mr Preston
I'd never believe that David did this terrible thing
But they haven't said so,it's possible they never will
But they think it
If not,why did the inspector want to take away his clothes
They only do that to criminals
It's horrible
Something they always have to do
Oh,we are going along now
You've no objections to me being with my client when he makes his statement?
No,none at all,we prefer you do
Well,we won't be long,Mrs Preston
-Take this in to Sgt. Evans will you?
-Very good,Sir
This way please,Mr Preston
Sit down,please,Mr Petherbridge
This is only an informal talk I don't intend to make me notes
Now then,Mr Preston
The caretaker of Mr Wainwright's house told our people that somebody rang up for Mr Wainwright
 at about half past 9 this morning
-Was it you?
-Yes
I intended to ask Mr Wainwright
That's quite all right
Only it occurred to me that you might have given me that information by mistake
That you might have stayed with
Mr Wainwright some other time and got it mixed up with a visit you paid to another friend on Monday night
Well,when I saw you this morning
I explained that I only wanted the information to rule out the story which Robinson told Major Watson
Now I'm not asking for a minute by minute account of everything you did that night
But as a man can't very often do that when he's suddenly asked
For instance Monday afternoon I went for a walk in the park
Stopped and watch the football match
I couldn't tell anybody what time I stopped
 or how long I watched the football
You see what I mean I just want a rough idea
I can't tell you anything about my movements on Monday night or anything about Tuesday until I retuned home in the evening because
I had a lapse of memory
I see
Hello,doctor,what are you doing here?
I'm waiting to see the inspector
Oh,I want to see him too
The inspector got the club books and there's a meeting of the subcommittee tonight
Heaven knows what's going to happen
Poor old Preston,I'd never have believed it
But then you know,when you see that pictures in the paper
It always is that sort of fellow,isn't it?
Well,have you any little,shall we say,gleams of memory?
Only little memories that couldn't belong to other time
No,I have tried to think,there's nothing
Well,did you have everything with you when you got back?
Nothing missing?
Well,anything found,anything say like a bus ticket or anything like that,anything
That might show where you went or what you did
Been through all my pockets with the hope of finding something,there was nothing
Now,about this safe,Mr Preston
Do you happen to know how many keys there are to it?
Oh,yes,they are three,Major
Watson has one,I have one there's one at the bank down here
I imagine you keep yours in a safe place
Keep it with my other keys,this
My office key,keys to the house, this is the key for the safe
Oh,that's all right
Robinson the steward didn't have one then?
No,no need for him to go to the safe,he had a till all of his own
You got a key to the club itself I suppose
Yes,with the others
Here
Do you sometimes go around there after the steward has closed up for the night?
Occasionally I have a small office there, sometimes I walk round after supper
And you have no recollection at all of having been there on Monday night?
None whatever
Do you re...
Do you think they'll swallow his loss of memory idea?
Why not? It's true
But could a fellow do all that sort of things with his memory gone?
Oh,it's possible but I don't believe he did
What do they they call it insane or something?
You're an old friend of his,Watson?
Well,I've known him for 10 years or more 
I roped him in when I first started my club
And naturally you want to do all you can to help him
Well,I don't want to make things worse for him any more than you do but I'm president of that club and I must get that money back
Now,tell me another thing
Supposing they let him off supposing they say that he is innocent, would he be allowed to keep the money?
Why are you so convinced he took the money?
Well, it's bound to come out, so you may as well know it
Preston was hard up,he borrowed money all around the club,I lent him 50 £ myself
But he paid you back
Oh yes in time
But I never known a man get cleared out of debt once he started borrowing
Now another thing
He hated that club steward
He was always bringing up petty complaints about him trying to get him the sack
Now I can tell you another thing too
That safe was not opened by a key: it was broken open
Well,if Preston had a key why do that?
Don't need a Sherlock Holmes to answer that one
He broke it open because he had a key and Robinson hadn't
And furthermore he knew that Robinson was starting for holidays that night
See?
I don't see anything except a lot of chance things that might happen to anyone
But you didn't see his face when I told him that Robinson had been around to see me
He looked awful
Then he tried that story about spending the night with friends on the other side of London
Now look, a man with a blank space in his memory can say anything on the spur of the moment
When I told him I was going to the police about the robbery he practically went down on his bended knees and begged me not to
Would a fellow do that if he didn't know something?
If Preston was at the safe and Robinson caught him there why let Robinson come round and tell you abut it before doing anything?
Because he didn't know that
Robinson was coming round to see me
I could tell that when
I told him that myself
I thought he was going to faint
Now put yourself in his place remember and see what you would do
You plan a robbery and try to plant it on to somebody else
Then a man,that you planned to plant it on
Catches you red-handed
You tell him some story about better keep the money yourself
And he goes off but you don't
 know whether you convinced him
Then suddenly you remember that you've broken open the safe yourself and ought to make it look as if he did it
All right so far?
-Oh yes, perfectly
-OK
Remain of the jam(?)
Now you know he's got to get home and get his bag and then catch the train to London
You know where he lives,you know the path he's got to take across the common
How was the murder done?
Knocked on the head from behind
Battered in
Yes,it does look bad for Preston
But then if you try a lot of chance things together and throw a bit of imagination it might look as just as bad even worse
-For others
-Oh yes
-Even for you
-For me?
That's rich
Why not?
Supposing you wanted money
You knew where it was just as well as Preston did
On what proof you've got that Robinson ever came round to your house that night at all,was there a witness?
My wife was there
In the room?
No,she was in bed but she heard the bell
That's easy,I mean you could have gone out and rang the bell yourself if necessary
You see we've only got your word that Robinson came round that night and accused Mr Preston
Suppose you broke open the safe because you have a key
At first perhaps you mean it to appear as an outside burglary
But Robinson captures you red handed
All right so far?
Far from it,I was at the pictures on Monday night
I only got back just before Robinson called
But can you prove it?
Did you go with anyone?
No,my wife doesn't like the pictures I always go by myself
You see,no proof you were at the pictures no proof Robinson called
You killed Robinson to keep him quiet then you think of Preston you know it's common knowledge in the club that he disliked Robinson you knew he borrowed money,good
You go round to Preston's house to see how things are
And by the grace of the devil
You discovered this lapse of memory that's makes even Preston doubts himself it's wonderful,you're clear leave Preston alone and his own imagination will do the rest
You got quite a imagination yourself
But you make one big mistake
In your overanxiety to set the blame squarely on Preston
You talked against him so much that you make the police suspicious
They enquire into your movements and find you can't prove a thing about that night
I tell you I was at the pictures
When you tell the police that old yarn they'll laugh
I mean everybody trying to prove a false alibi says they were at the pictures
There was one the other day
They are hanging him on Friday
Oh
Of course I know perfectly well you had not anything to do with it
I'm only trying to tell you how easy it would be for an innocent person to bring suspicion on himself simply by trying to incriminate another one
I never said I wanted to
I know,I know I was just speaking generally that's all
Hello old chap,if there is anything
I can do for you,just let me know
Thanks
Would you come in now please,Sir
No,not you,Major Watson,Dr Sparling
Would you mind waiting a few minutes
I understand you want to see the clubs books
Come here,this room
I understand that Mrs Preston called you in last night to see her husband
Yes,about half past seven just after he got home
Now,this lost memory business, can you tell me anything about it
What makes it happen?
Well,in most cases it is usually do to a mental strain
I mean,if a man suppresses it and keeps it to himself it keeps building up and until the strain is too great for the brain to bear
And then the mind shuts off and stops working or rather like a generating station when the load gets too heavy
In a case like this have you anyway of telling if it's genuine?
Oh,you can if you see the patient when he's actually suffering from amnesia
But if you don't see it until it's over then you only got his words for it
You got your own instinct and judgement
I talked with Preston for a quite a while last night
And again this morning
And I'm certain that everything he told me was the truth
Did he tell you that he spent that night with a friend in Wembley?
When a man tells you a barefaced story like that
It makes you wonder about the rest of what he says,doesn't it?
Now you say he saw you again this morning
Yes,he came out to my surgery
And on account of something he told you then you advised him to see a solicitor?
Well,it was because of this untrue statement
I thought he should see a solicitor
Was that all he told you?
It's all right ,doctor,I understand your position
If you think that he made any kind of confession,I can tell you at once,he didn't
Did you know he was badly pressed for money?
Yes,I've been told so by a friend of his
And he had a violent dislike for this murdered man?
Now,if he's as straight forward as you think he is
Why should he sit there desperately trying to conceal something from me?
Look,your business is mainly with criminals,inspector
If you are dealing with an honest man
Depends what you call honest
Well,we got quite a lot of fellows like Preston
Decent,respectable people who live quietly, dig the garden,go for a walk on a Sunday
Perfectly good straight chaps
Except for the one little thing that brings them round here
Doesn't make sense does it?
Tea's ready dear
-Good
-I thought you'd like some toast
Yes,that's fine
I
I've been sorting out a few things this afternoon,Janet
Only the gas bill,the laundry and the small account for Rogers for the tulips
I've written cheques for those
Certainly won't be necessary,David
Yes I know but I always done these little things myself
I wouldn't like you to be troubled or confused,if you were alone
I'm sure there's no need,dear
If they were going to do anything they'd done it already,when they had you at the police station
The inspector was so nice when he rang me up
Yes,he's a nice man
I'm lucky
He said to see you rested when you got home and not to worry
Wouldn't have been as cruel as to say a thing like that if he meant anything
Yes,he let me go home all right but he
He put a policeman to watch the house
You imagine things,David,there's often a policeman out there by the High Street
There's being one there all day standing under the lamp post
You're just tormenting yourself,dear
You know
If you were alone,Janet,I wouldn't like you to live by yourself
I was thinking,perhaps your sister would care to come or whether you go to her
You see,your sister would have her pension and you'll have your annuity
-You're listening,Janet?
-Yes
It wouldn't be much but two women can always manage together
You might even start up a kindergarten school again like you had with her in the old days
Would you? Would you do that Janet?
I'll do whatever you say, dear,until you came back
I had a talk this morning with the solicitor about that moneylender you know,there's nothing whatever for you to worry about
He'd have no power to make any claim on you
In fact,I don't think he can claim anything anyway
I paid him a lot more than he lent me
And Mr Petherbridge says the solicitor's letter will settle it
Now,I'm telling you this because if he should write,don't answer it
Give the letter straight to Mr Petherbridge
Above all
Don't dream of doing anything silly
Like trying to raise money on that annuity and sending it to him
-Now you promise me that?
-Yes
I'd written to the bank
I want you to post that
If they take me away
I'll explain everything and I'm sure they'll do something for you after all the time I've been with them
You mustn't talk like this,dear,I can't bear it
Yes,but I couldn't bear it if I had to go away without thinking with arranged everything possible between us it's so simple sitting here by ourselves
Afterwards
Don't think they let us be alone together
But
Even if they did take you away they couldn't treat you like a criminal
Doctor Sparling said they couldn't possibly do that
It wouldn't be human to blame you for something that happened when you weren't yourself
Oh,we got to face these things,dear even if they believe when I say that I wasn't myself that night
They wouldn't let me go,they couldn't
There are place for people who do things when they are not themselves and then
We are not certain they'll believe I lost my memory at all
Then,it's true,David
It is true,isn't it?
Oh I swear that,Janet
Those things you thought you remembered you mustn't tell them that
Well,if they ask me in the court,I'm afraid I'll have to
But Mr Petherbridge said no
He said not to in my statement to police,that's all but you see these people that cross examine they'll tearing things out of you, they'll go on till they do
I couldn't bear that,Janet
At least I can keep myself self-respect and if I can do that
I don't mind what happens as long as you promise to carry on and be happy
How could I be happy?
By believing in me,dear
By trusting me when I tell you
I didn't do this deliberately
It means so much to me if you do that
Now
You start up that little school again it'll give you an interest and help you along
In any case you always have your annuity, one can never take that away from you
Never have to be dependent on anybody
Well,I still think it never happened David, it's your imagination all the time
I took a lot of trouble with this toast
You always knew the way to make toast
You haven't slept at all
Even rested properly since you came home
Go up and lie down and try to get some sleep
Yes
I think that's a good idea
At seven we'll have supper and then,why not go to the pictures
It's our night,isn't it?
By so it is,it's Wednesday,I've forgotten
They didn't say you had to stay in
We'll say good evening to that policeman on the corner
You see,he'll say good evening back and not take a bit of notice
And you wonder why you've been so silly
Oh I can't think why you are so good to me
It's you who is always good to me
You will go and try and rest,won't you?
Yes
Don't you worry
I
I would like you
Just to have a look at this account book
Make sure you understand everything and let me know if there's anything you don't, now it's quite simple that
What we receive here and the payments there
Now there's not much now
But there will be nearly 100 £ when my salary comes in next week
And now you don't owe anything
Nothing
We'll save up and go abroad again next summer
Yes,we'll do that
Draw the curtains and have a good sleep
There's one or two things to tidy up,then I will
I'll come up and call you when supper is ready
Then the pictures
That'll be fine
Oh,good evening
-Does Mr Preston live here?
-Yes
-Are you Mrs Preston?
-Yes
Could I speak to Mr Preston,please?
He's resting and I can't disturb him now
But it's about this trouble,this murder
Then you'd better come in
You see,I'm really quite an old friend of Mr Preston
And I thought I might be able help him
What? I think I know most of my husband's friends
Well I expect you do,I don't suppose Dave ever told you about me
Dave?
Well,Mr Preston
He always let me call him Dave
But I'm sorry
Is he in trouble about this murder?
I mean really in trouble?
Because if he is I want to help him and I think I can
Then you'd better sit down
-You live in a nice house
-Yes
You,you haven't told me your name?
It's Miss Dobson,Peggy Dobson
I work with my brother
 and sister at the Feathers
River Lane,just off Queen
Victoria Street in the City,you know?
-The Feathers?
-It's a public house
Our own place
What is you want to say?
Well,I came down as soon as I could get away
I only heard about this trouble at lunchtime
My husband's name hasn't been in the papers,how did you know he was in trouble?
Well,a young man who lunches at our place comes from down here and he told us how they had Mr
Preston round at the police station
Of course he read about this murder in the papers but even if they had mentioned him,we might never had known it was our Mr Preston
Your Mr Preston?
I know it's funny we've known him all these years,and we never knew where he came from
We only realized when this young man said
You know that fellow Preston who comes every evening they are after him for that Bromley murder
And then I saw I got to come at once
I thought things must be bad
Yes,they are bad
But why did you come,what's it's about?
Well,everything
Last Monday night
You see,Mr Preston been coming to our place always since the war
He just drops in when he's on his way home
Look
If you think there's anything in this, you're wrong because there isn't
I'm not the sort that goes out with other people's husbands and I never did
I didn't suggest it,Miss Dobson
No,but you're looking,anyone can see that
It's no use my talking to you, if you aren't going to listen why don't you call him down and let me tell him
No,my husband is very tired, he's trying to rest now if you have anything to say,you can tell me
The Feathers is respectable
You can ask anybody
All he ever had was a sherry or a sandwich maybe
So nice,we sit down chatting in our private room
Your private room?
Because he came before we open,that's why
Or sometimes we go into the salon bar have a game of dart
But he always left on the stroke of 6 to catch the train at Cannon Street
You say he's done this for a long time
Oh,every evening regular
Getting on for five years now
Well,we thought he looked specially tired on Monday night
So I gave him a Bovril sandwich with the sherry
Then we went into the salon bar for a game of darts
We were laughing and joking
And then the strangest thing happened
There is a little truck that brings our sandwiches from a place in Hornsea
But it was just starting off and he had a terrific backfire
Like a gun going off,we all jumped because it startled us
Mr Preston did too
He turned his head quickly
And when he turned it back, he looked different
What do you mean he looked different?
He looked round as if he didn't know where he was and dropped the dart he had in his hand
And he said
Everyone down to the dugout
What dugout?
I don't know,we never had a dugout, we always used the cellar in the war
That he made us see what had happened
We knew he'd been an air raid warden
And he suddenly thought the war was still on
Of course we talked to him and told him it was all right
But he
He just kind of mumbled and kept shaking his head
You see didn't know what to do
Why didn't you telephone and tell me?
Then how could we? We didn't know where he lived
And there are crowds of
Preston in the telephone book
Then opening time came
Of course we couldn't have him sitting in the bar looking like that
So my brother Joe took him up to the spare bed room and made him lie down
Hoping he get all right
Actually he dozed off,but it wasn't an ordinary sleep because we couldn't wake him
When the bar closed at 10,we all went up all three of us and sat about there talking on what we ought to do
But you could have sent for a doctor
Oh,we did think of that
We even thought sending for the police
He didn't have anything to help us
No identity card or letters or anything
But he was sleeping so peacefully, we thought we'd better leave him
And see how he felt when he woke up
No,thank you
Well,Joe and I looked at him twice during the night
Still sound asleep
But he woke quite easily when
I took his cup of tea in the morning
Still very odd,though
He still didn't know where he lived or the place where he worked
He didn't seem to care or want to think when we asked him
He washed,shaved himself quite naturally with Joe's razor
But his mind was still all mixed up with the war
He kept on saying,it was a quiet day with no alarms and then he say
Listen,there's one coming
Take cover
He was thinking of the fly bombs all the time
We gave him some breakfast and made him stay quietly in his room
But Joe said if he wasn't better by the afternoon he had to take him round to the police station
You knew that his bank was quite close why didn't you tell them?
We didn't know,of course we knew he worked in a bank,but we didn't know where
He didn't discuss those things, it wasn't our affair
The doctor said it might be something like this
What did he do the whole day?
He just sat about up there in that bedroom
Soon after five Joe said the only thing to do was to take him round to the police station and tell them what happened
That was really the oddest part of all
We went into the salon bar, we all had a sherry
And then he began to change
He looked
Puzzled and restless
And then he sort of raised himself up and said
Well
Aren't we going to finish our game of darts?
Come on
What are we waiting for
Of course we quite didn't know what to do at first
But Joe thought it was better not to say anything in case it upset him again
You know it was kind of uncanny
Then a new round,you know trying to make jokes and ordinary conversation
Bang
Time to go
-Hello,nice speaking
-Hello
Well,of course we hated the idea of him going off like that alone
But,honestly,he looked so ordinary and natural when he took his hat and umbrella off the peg we almost thought we were the funny ones
Hello,Dave
Why did you come here?
Oh,I heard you were in trouble,Dave
I
I should have told you,Janet
Never mind about that,dear,listen to what Miss Dobson has to say
Then I thought that I'd better find out where you lived and come down to try to help you
How could you help me?
Miss Dobson says you spent the whole of Monday night in her care(?)
You stayed the whole night at the Feathers,Dave
When I tell them that,they can't go after you any more
You know I left your house at 6 o'clock as St Paul was striking 6
Yes,but you didn't,I mean not on the same day as you came in
You didn't come out until this murder was all over
I came into your house just after 5 it was exactly 5 by the office clock, when I left the bank
And I left your house as the clock was striking,the police know that
The police never came near our place,how can they know?
Because I told them everything that happened just as I remembered
Janet I came round to tell you something
Upstairs in the bedroom I suddenly remembered quite clearly the people in the compartment that the train left Cannon street it was an old man with red flower in his buttonhole
And two girls,two girls reading books
Look,David,it doesn't matter what you say or think directly I've been to the police station,your troubles are over
Do the police know that you come here?
Not yet,they jolly soon will
You know what will happen if you went to them how serious it would be,you're not a child,Peggy,you realize the consequences?
Look,Dave,you don't understand what's happened to you and you're not trying to understand
I am trying to understand,Peggy
I'm trying to understand why these terrible things should happen to me
What can make me think I could save myself by dragging in my best friend get him to stand by me swearing I was in his house that night
The police would have found him out and he'd been arrested that's what would happen to you if you went with this tale they'd call it perjury, you could go to jail for it now I want you to go home Peggy, you're dealing in dangerous things more dangerous than you realize, now you promise me that'll you go home
Peggy,you must go at once
Take her out that way, she can use the side door this man is from the police if he says anything to you,you say anything but you know nothing about this
You understand
Oh,stay here
Good evening,Mrs Preston, is your husband home?
Oh,yes,yes he's upstairs but first I want you to hear what this young lady has to say
Well,I expect you're Miss Dobson
I heard you'd come down
I've been having a talk with your brother and sister at Feathers this afternoon
Yes,you had,have you?
Well,Mrs Preston,I'm sure it must be a relief to you
You know we never real thought your husband was involved
We had to check up on these things,of course
Inspector,I want you to make you understand
Ever since that terrible news last night
My husband thought himself to be a criminal lunatic
Waiting to be taken away and locked up for the rest of his life
Can't you realize what's that's done to him?
Yes I can,Mrs Preston,I only wish it could have been avoided
He's always lived so quietly
Only wanted to do his work
And enjoy his evenings and be happy with his friends
A thing like this would have driven him mad
He wouldn't even listen to what Miss Dobson had to say
You got to go up and convince him
It was I came to do,Mrs Preston
As far as your husband's concerns there's no more to worry about
It's perfectly all right
Oh,so it's perfectly all right is it?
You think you can walk in here smiling and everything is all right
Anybody would think you'd talking about a lost dog that's come home
Don't you realize you made him ill?
When you knew he hadn't done it why couldn't you phone up from the Feathers and tell him so?
No, not you
You come sailing in your own good time and let him wait let him suffer,whatever his feelings matter
All you fellows are good for is hanging around our place at night waiting to see for if anyone has a glass of beer five past 10
I'll go now,Mrs Preston,you don't want me about
-I do hope he'll be all right,good night
-Good night,thank you
Thank you
Do you want me for anything else?
No,there's nothing,thank you
You know where to find me,if you do
It's Peggy Dobson,the Feathers,River Lane
I'm sorry,inspector,but it was nice of her to come
Now
He's in his bedroom
There
Oh,I
I'm just coming down
Well,just came up to tell you there's no more for you to worry about
It's perfectly true
Now
You won't need this thing
Come and sit down
And I'll tell you all about it
Well,to begin with,Mr Preston
We've got the man who did it
As a matter of fact it was you, who put us on the right track
When you told me about the little chap who worked in the hospital in the evenings and the club kitchen weekends
But the thing that had been puzzling us was the co-incidence of someone trying to plant a robbery on a man the very night is missing from home
You know it looks to me as if Robinson, the club steward and this little chap had planned to get that money
Maybe Monday night,maybe the next,I don't know
But when they hear the club treasury is missing,it's a gift
They break open the safe,share the money
Robinson goes around to Major Watson, tries to plant the thing on you
After that,it's the old story of thieves falling out
Anyway,Robinson got a knock over the head,the other chap took the lot
Isn't it splendid,Mrs Preston,we've got all the money back bar two pounds ten
That's fine,Major
Of course,I always said your husband was innocent
But if I were he,I'd prosecute that inspector
Tell him to be at the club tomorrow evening
It's the draw
-Good night,Mrs Preston
-Good night
Well,I'm afraid it caused you awful lot of trouble and anxiety,Mr Preston
But
The sort of thing that might happen to anybody
Oh,and
Here's a pair of gloves and a handkerchief which you left in a spare room at the Feathers
I believe your solicitor was a bit worried about this
Well,I say good night now,Mr Preston
Good night
Inspector
Your flowers
Thank you very much,Mrs Preston
My wife will be delighted
Subtitles by Nostromo
Daddy, you're sure I've never been to Africa before?
It looks familiar.
You saw the same scenery last summer driving to Las Vegas.
Oh, sure. Where Daddy lost all that money at the crap...
Hey!
...table.
Hey, look! A camel.
Uh-huh.
Of course this isn't really Africa, honey. It's the French Morocco.
Well, it's northern
Africa.
Still seems like Las Vegas.
We're just 100 miles north of the Sahara desert.
Do you realize that, son?
I don't know. In school, they call this the dark continent.
This is twice as bright as Indianapolis.
Ah, you just wait till we get to Marrakech.
Marrakech?
Sounds like a drink.
Hmm.
It sure does.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Hold on here.
What's the matter?
Well, I sure want to thank you.
Without your help, anything might have happened here.
My pleasure, monsieur.
There are moments in life when we all need a little help.
Yeah. Just what was the trouble?
Your little boy accidentally pulled off his wife's veil.
You know?
Oh, yeah.
Hank!
I want to introduce my wife, Mrs. McKenna.
How do you do?
How do you do, madame?
My name is
Louis Bernard.
Well, we thank you very much, Mr. Bernard.
That's our son, Hank.
Hello, Hank.
Hello.
You talk Arab talk.
A few words.
Why was he so angry?
It was just an accident.
But the Muslim religion allows for few accidents.
Yeah, I suppose so.
Oh.
May I...
Yeah, sit down right in front of Jo there.
Oh, I thought his name was Hank.
No, it's my wife's name.
You see, J-O. No "E."
How different.
It's short for Josephine.
I've called her that so long nobody knows her by any other name.
Do they?
No.
I do. Mommy.
Oh, yeah.
Forgot about that.
Now, about the accident.
You see, a Muslim woman never takes off her veil in public under any circumstances. I see.
You mean they feed intravenously?
No, Hank.
What a big word for such a small boy.
You see,
I'm a doctor.
Oh, well, he sounds like one.
Oh, yeah.
He can spell hemoglobin.
Of course, he has a little trouble with words like dog and cat.
Where do you practice, Doctor?
Indianapolis, Indiana. Good
Samaritan Hospital out there.
What brings you to Marrakech?
You see, we were attending a medical convention in Paris.
And I thought as much as as we were in Europe,
I'd come down and see Morocco again.
Daddy liberated
Africa.
Well, I was stationed up in Casablanca at an army field hospital during the war.
Do you live in Morocco,
Mr. Bernard?
No.
I suppose you came directly from Paris.
We looked in on
Lisbon and Rome.
And Casablanca.
And Casablanca.
I hope you will have time to truly enjoy Marrakech.
Well, let's see. We'll have at the most about three days.
You will naturally be stopping at the hotels La Mamounia or La Menara.
Why do you ask?
Because they are hotels for tourists of good taste.
Oh.
Do you live in France, Mr. Bernard?
Sometimes.
Do you eat snails?
When I'm lucky enough to get them.
Well, if you ever get hungry, our garden back home is full of snails.
Thank you for the invitation.
That's all right. We tried everything to get rid of them.
We never thought of a Frenchman.
Here we go.
Say, do you want to share a taxi with us down to the hotel?
That's kind of you,
Doctor, but unfortunately, I have some business first.
Oh, I see.
What business are you in, Mr. Bernard?
However, I'll be there later. Perhaps we might have a drink together.
Well, no, come up to our suite.
We'll have a drink up there.
In that case, I will take you to dinner.
No, that's not fair.
But I know Marrakech.
I can show you an intriguing Arab restaurant where the food is different and the manner of eating exotic.
Well, that's what we came here for. How about it, Jo?
How about one of those Arabian nights?
I'd love it.
How would you prefer to travel to the hotel? By taxi, fiacre?
Gee, I don't know.
A wagon! I wanna ride in a wagon!
Well, I guess it's a wagon.
See you later.
Au revoir. I look forward to the cocktails.
Good-bye. Come on.
Bye.
Hank, you sit up with the driver.
How do you like this?
A horse-drawn convertible.
Well, I just saw Louis
Bernard talking to that Arab.
What Arab?
The one that was shouting at
Hank for pulling the veil off.
They were talking like they were very dear friends.
Well, he probably knew him before. What does that mean?
It means that Mr. Bernard is a very mysterious man.
What? He seemed perfectly normal to me.
Now, what do you really know about him?
What do I know about him? I know his name.
We were sitting there.
We were talking.
You don't know anything about this man, and he knows everything there is to know about you.
Oh, wait.
He knows that you live in Indianapolis, Indiana.
He knows that you're a doctor at the Good Samaritan Hospital.
And he knows that you attended a medical convention in Paris, and that you stopped off in
Rome, and Lisbon and Casablanca for just a few days.
All right.
And he knows that you served in north
Africa in an army field hospital.
Honey, it was just a casual conversation. That's all.
Darling, you weren't just talking casually.
He was asking all kinds of questions, and you were answering them.
You might as well have handed him your passport.
Well, what's the difference?
We just have a conversation.
I've got nothing to hide.
I have a feeling that Mr. Bernard has.
Oh, honey.
I know this is mysterious Morocco, but we're not going to lose our head, are we?
I know.
I know what it is.
What?
Why, you're sore because this fella didn't ask you any questions.
Huh?
Oh, hardy-har-har.
Hardy-har.
Well, this eases the pain.
What pain, Mommy?
It's just an expression, honey.
Hey, can you take care of the driver? Yes, sir.
My name is McKenna,
Dr. McKenna.
I'll take care of everything, sir.
Come on.
We're being watched.
What? Oh, come on!
Que sera, sera
What will be, will be
When I was just a little boy
I asked my mother what will I be
He'll make a fine doctor.
Will I be handsome?
Will I be rich?
Here's what she said to me
Come on, darling.
Que sera, sera
Whatever will be, will be
The future's not ours to see
Que sera, sera
What will be, will be
Second verse.
When I was just a child in school
I asked my teacher what should I try
Catch.
Should I paint pictures?
Should I sing songs?
This was her wise reply
Que sera, sera
Whatever will be, will be
The future's not ours to see
Que sera, sera
Oops!
What will be, will be
May I have this next dance? Yes.
All right.
Oh, you're divine.
Dinner for the boy.
Yeah, come in. Right around the corner.
I can't tell you how beautifully your wife sings.
Pretty good, isn't she?
Oh, she's marvelous.
Too bad it was interrupted.
I had that same feeling myself many times.
Well, everything's fine.
The manager has a babysitter for us.
Good.
Mrs. McKenna, permit me the pleasure of serving you a drink.
I would love it.
Thank you.
Were you on the American stage, Mrs. McKenna?
Yes, Mr. Bernard, I was on the American stage, and the London stage, and the Paris stage.
Oh?
I thought perhaps you had seen me in Paris, being French.
You know, the theater requires time, and for me, time is often a luxury.
Have you ever been to Paris, Mr. Bernard?
I was born there.
What business are you in?
I buy and sell.
What?
Whatever gives the best profit.
Well, now that you're in Marrakech, what are you buying and selling?
You know, I would much rather talk about the stage.
If you tell me what shows you are in...
Would you excuse me?
I'll get it.
No, I got it.
No, I will.
I'm inquiring for the room of Monsieur Montgomery.
He asked me for a drink, and I...
I'm sorry. There's no Montgomery here.
Pardon me, monsieur.
I regret disturbing you.
Okay.
May I use your telephone, please?
Yeah, sure.
It's right there.
Mommy!
Yes?
I can't cut this meat.
I'll do it for you, dear.
Hello?
I'm terribly sorry, but I cannot go to dinner with you tonight.
Oh?
Oh!
I have neglected an important matter which now requires my attention.
I see.
Perhaps another night?
Sure. Sure. We'll get together again.
Good-bye.
Good-bye.
Bye.
Good night.
Good night.
My name's McKenna.
Of course. The hotel phoned. Follow me, please.
I think you will find this comfortable.
Thank you very much.
Honey, move over here.
Let me sit out there.
You're on my dress.
Whoop!
Yeah.
We always wash the hands before eating.
Oh!
Thank you.
Whoop!
Those people are staring at us.
What people?
Right in back of us.
What?
Yes.
Here.
They were staring at us in front of the hotel too.
Jo, will you please stop imagining things?
I'm not.
Good evening. You must think me awfully rude.
I've been staring at you ever since I saw you at the hotel.
You are Jo Conway, the Jo Conway?
Yes, I am.
Didn't I tell you?
I knew I was right.
I'm Lucy Drayton, and this is my husband.
How do you do?
How do you do?
We're Dr. And
Mrs. McKenna.
My wife tells me
Mrs. McKenna appeared at the London Palladium a few years ago.
Of course, we hardly ever see a show now.
Edward is such an old stick in the mud.
So I have to console myself with your records.
Oh! I must admit I love them.
I'm not one for this terrible bebop or whatever you call it.
Thank you very much. When are you coming back to London?
Possibly never again, professionally.
Oh! Don't say you're giving up the stage.
Well, temporarily,
I am.
Well, it's just that I'm a doctor, and you know, a doctor's wife never has as much time...
What my husband is trying to say is Broadway musical shows are not produced in Indianapolis, Indiana.
Well, you know... Of course, we could live in New York.
I hear that doctors aren't starving there either.
Well, it's not that I have any objection to working in New York.
It's just that it'd be hard for my patients to come from Indianapolis for treatment.
You know, dear, I'm always saying the wrong thing. I'm sorry.
Oh, not in the least.
Tell me, Dr. McKenna, do you also go...
Hey, why don't all of you sort of turn around here or something.
It's kind of kind of hard on the neck.
It's in one of our English counties.
It's not what you'd call a farm.
It's really more of a small holding.
Ah, here we are.
Isn't that fascinating?
Yes.
There we are.
Hey, they look good.
Surprise.
They look wonderful.
Ah, looks like bread.
We're not going to eat all that, are we?
No.
Is that the way you do it? Just break it?
Yes, just break it. Just break it. Just like this.
It won't break.
Oh, no.
Well, I'm gonna...
There.
Is that the way you do it?
That's quite all right.
That was a tough one.
Does it chew any better than it tears?
Is it fattening?
I imagine it might be.
No, it's pretty good, hon.
Well, I...
No plate.
No?
No.
No knife or forks.
That's right. I understand you're just supposed to dig in.
Allow me to show you, will you?
You use only the first two fingers and thumb of the right hand.
You don't use the other two fingers, and always the left hand in the lap.
Oh, I see.
May I show you?
Just these two fingers, huh?
Can I help you?
I'll hold it for you.
That's it.
There we are.
Well...
Boy, could I use this hand now. I can't...
It's all right. Nobody minds. No one minds.
That's good style.
No one minds.
It's messy, but worth it.
I think I'll practice on an olive.
Oh!
Honey, it's wonderful.
Here. Take a bite.
Good?
Yeah.
Tell me, does this way of eating have to do with religion or something?
I think it's more social than religious.
I don't know.
It seems like to me if you have four good fingers and a thumb, you ought to be able to use all of them.
It's very good, isn't it?
Very good.
Well, as I was saying,
I was quite happy farming my bit of land down in Buckinghamshire when these United Nations fellows started worrying me.
Edward was a big noise in the Ministry of Food during the war, you know.
So we pulled ourselves up by the roots, and here we are,
United Nations Relief.
Sounds like interesting work.
I'm preparing a report on soil erosion at the moment.
You know, parts of this country are not unlike your
Dust Bowl formation.
A thin layer of topsoil and underneath...
How do you like that? First he promises to take us to dinner...
Yeah. Well, we just met him today, honey.
You can't expect him to change his whole life.
Ben, what's the matter with you?
What's the matter with me?
There's nothing the matter with me. What's the matter with you?
I just don't want to be insulted. That's all.
Oh, you're not being insulted.
After all, you can't blame him, can we, for turning down an old married couple like us for a girl like that.
We're not an old married couple!
All right.
All right.
All right, he's a heel.
I don't understand him, but I'm beginning not to like what he's doing to our whole night.
I must do some shopping in the market tomorrow.
I do hope it'll be fine.
Well, not too fine.
Of course, I know that our
English weather is pretty awful, but sometimes, you know, I think we don't realize when we're lucky.
All this sunshine day after day, well, it doesn't seem natural somehow.
I want to get up.
Ben, don't.
I know you. Once you get worked up, you start a fight.
Now, forget about him.
Will you come to the market with us tomorrow?
As a matter of fact, Louis
Bernard, the big buyer from Paris, was going to take us to the marketplace tomorrow.
Yeah. Yeah, I think I'll go over and cancel out.
Now, Ben, sit down and eat your dinner. It's getting cold.
We'd love to go.
Oh, good, good.
We'd be delighted.
I don't know why he gets so worked up over unimportant things.
Monsieur!
What's he saying,
Mrs. Drayton?
He's the teller of tales, Hank.
Isn't this exciting?
Just like the county fair when I was a kid.
They got everything but the balloon ascension.
What's so funny about that? Did you ever see a balloon ascension?
No, you know what
I was just thinking?
You know what's paying for these three days in Marrakech?
Me.
Mrs. Campbell's gallstones.
Oh!
You know the purse I bought in Paris? Yeah.
Bill Edward's tonsils.
Mommy! Daddy!
Daddy, come with us! We're gonna see the medicine man.
Maybe you can learn something, Daddy.
I wouldn't be a bit surprised.
Anytime he starts wearing you out...
Oh, I haven't enjoyed the market so much. Oh!
You know, I never thought of it that way before.
What?
I'm wearing Johnny
Matthews' appendix.
Oh, dear.
What about the boat trip?
Let's see, it took two boys, one girl and two sets of twins, didn't it?
And Mrs. Morgan's hives.
Well, how are the acrobats today?
Oh, wonderful.
Watch that kid that goes clear to the top there. He's great.
I'll see you later.
Yes.
All the way home, we'll be riding on Herbie Taylor's ulcers.
And Allida Markle's asthma.
Now, if we could just get four cases of the seven-year itch, we could retire.
Or if Mrs. Yarro's really gonna have triplets, we could completely redecorate the house, couldn't we?
What would they say if they heard us?
You know, one of the reasons I came to a place like Marrakech is so we could say things like that without everybody hearing us.
Well, I'd like to say something where nobody could hear us.
This is the safest place.
When are we going to have another baby?
You're the doctor.
You have all the answers.
Yeah, but this is the first time
I've ever heard the question.
Mommy, look!
Come here!
Look. Sewing machines. Looks like a television commercial.
Having a good time,
Hank?
I guess so.
Oh, he's delighted with everything.
Coming through!
Coming through!
Hank! Hank, come back here!
Hank!
Hank!
Hank!
It's best to keep out of trouble, Hank.
What's going on?
Looks like the police are chasing somebody.
Hey.
Hey, look there.
You better stand back.
Go on. Stand back.
Monsieur McKenna.
I'm Louis Bernard.
A man, a statesman, he is to be killed, assassinated, in London.
Soon, very soon.
Tell them in London.
Ambrose Chappell.
Ben, who is he?
Louis Bernard.
You got something to write on? Louis Bernard?
He's dead.
He says,
"Do you know this man?"
Yes, we do know him.
He's Louis Bernard, the...
Louis Bernard?
Monsieur and
Madame McKenna.
He wants you to go to police headquarters to make a statement.
Okay.
Our friends have to go to the police station.
I think I better go with them. Yes, of course.
You don't want your little boy to go, do you?
But I want to go to the police station.
I think it better if I take him back to the hotel, don't you?
Would you please?
Certainly.
Thank you.
You be a good boy, Hank.
We're to be going now.
Heaven knows when we shall be back.
Ben, why do you suppose he turned up in an Arab outfit and wearing make-up?
What's more important, why was he killed?
I'll bet he was a spy or something like that.
What were you writing down?
What was he telling you?
I'll tell you later.
What is it?
I just feel kind of funny.
Why should he pick me out to tell?
After what we said about him last night, the poor fella.
When we get in with the inspector,
I'll do my best to cut some of the red tape.
Fine. Fine.
Well, I'm going to stretch a bit.
I'm afraid the questions will go on till doomsday if you admit you knew this chap Bernard before.
I don't know him at all.
We met yesterday on a bus.
They're a cynical lot, you know, these French.
They might refuse to believe that.
Well, they've got to believe it. It's the truth.
Look at it from their point of view.
They saw this poor fellow whispering to you, and then they saw you write something down.
Are you gonna show them what you wrote?
Thank you, Mr. Drayton, but a translator will not be necessary.
Won't you come inside, madame, monsieur?
Please do me the kindness to wait.
I might have questions for you later.
Very good.
Passports, please.
You came to French
Morocco four days ago.
That's right.
You are a doctor, sir?
Yes, I'm a surgeon, a tourist and American citizen.
Three good reasons why you should have nothing in common with Louis Bernard.
I didn't have.
You were in Paris recently?
Yes, I was attending a medical convention.
You came to Marrakech with him in the same bus, had an aperitif with him in your hotel room, and you ate at the same restaurant last night.
Yes, but at different tables.
So Louis Bernard is a stranger to you?
I met him for the first time in my life yesterday on a bus.
And yet out of 5,000 people in a great marketplace, he comes to you when he is about to die.
Is that the action of a casual acquaintance, monsieur?
I know absolutely nothing about Louis Bernard.
No. Not even, I suppose, that he was an agent of the Deuxi├¿me Bureau?
What's that?
Perhaps you have also never heard of the American FBI?
Now, wait...
It would be so much easier for both of us, monsieur, if you would cease to pretend.
Look here...
The dead man found out what he had been sent here to discover.
That's why he was killed.
He told you what he had discovered. Why?
Because he placed complete confidence in you. Not true?
Boy, you not only ask the questions, you answer them too, don't you?
Let me ask you a question.
Assuming that Bernard trusted me as implicitly as you say, then I'd never reveal anything he said to me, would I?
Even Americans, I suppose, find it sometimes desirable to betray a confidence.
Wait a minute. Let's get some things straight here.
I'm a tourist. I'm traveling for pleasure.
I somehow got involved in this very unfortunate incident.
I came here to make a simple statement of fact and not be subjected to a police grilling.
Monsieur,
I would like you...
No, you let me finish.
Now, let me finish.
Entrez!
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Did he say I was wanted on the telephone?
I'll take that call now.
And you just take it easy.
Hello.
Dr. McKenna?
This is Dr. McKenna.
Who's this?
If you tell even one word of what Louis Bernard whispered to you in the marketplace, your little boy will be in serious danger.
Remember, say nothing.
Hello?
Drayton?
Didn't you tell me your wife was going to take Hank right straight back to the hotel?
I thought so, yes.
Well, call her up.
Somebody just called me and threatened me about Hank.
Go on. Call her up.
See if he's all right.
Hotel Mamounia?
My wife doesn't answer.
Concierge?
What's your room number?
Four fourteen.
I can't believe it.
She hasn't come back yet, huh?
At least nobody's seen her.
All right, now you go back to the hotel.
And see if you can find out what's going on.
It's so unlike my wife.
I'll take care of the police and join you as soon as I can.
Look here. Don't worry. It's probably some stupid misunderstanding.
If I find anything out before you get back, I'll telephone you here.
Just don't waste any time.
Good-bye.
Who was it, Ben?
It was the concierge at the hotel.
Oh.
He found out we were being held by the police.
He just called up to see if there was anything he could do.
That's very nice of him.
Yes, I thought so.
I told him if we weren't back there in 15 minutes, for him to call the American
Consulate at Casablanca.
But, monsieur, if you had only told me in the first place that you wished to consult with your consul.
Yeah, yeah.
Come on, Jo.
There is just one small formality.
I must request you to sign a statement of the facts.
If it doesn't take too long, of course.
But a moment.
I will send for a typist.
Ben?
Yeah?
Ben, aren't you going to let me see the message?
I don't...
I don't think
I should.
Darling, I'm not the police inspector.
I'm your wife, and I think that I should see it.
Ben, why didn't you give this to the police?
Because I didn't want to.
But, Ben, a man's life...
Is at stake.
Yeah, I know.
I just... I don't know what's the right thing to do.
Look, I think we should go back to the hotel, pick up Hank, and get out of here as quickly as we can.
Maybe.
Darling, think about Hank.
What a terrible thing this is for him, seeing a man murdered right before his eyes.
It's a horrible shock to a little boy.
I know.
Why don't you take that note, give it to the American Consulate?
And let's not get any more involved, please.
Why don't you get the key?
I'll take care of the driver.
All right.
Say, you know a Mrs. Drayton?
English lady.
That's right.
Did you see her coming from the marketplace any time in the last hour or so?
No, sir.
Now, wait a minute. You understand this is very important.
She had a little boy with her, my little boy.
No, sir.
Well, what about
Mr. Drayton?
Mr. Drayton checked out.
He what?
Checked out.
But he couldn't have.
Yes, sir, he did.
No, Mr. Drayton, the Englishman with the horn-rimmed glasses.
Yes, sir.
He checked out.
I don't know about you, but I'm exhausted.
I guess I'll call
Mrs. Drayton.
Tell her we're back.
She can bring up Hank.
Just hold that call a minute, Jo.
Why?
Because I asked you to!
Ben, are we about to have our monthly fight?
I hope not.
Well, then stop acting like that.
I merely said I was going to call Mrs. Drayton.
Just a minute.
Wait a minute.
Just a minute.
Just a minute.
I want you to take these. They'll relax you.
Relax me?
I'm so relaxed I'm tired.
I think maybe you need them.
These are for you, Jo.
Now, come on.
I'm the doctor.
Here.
Ben.
Jo, you know what happens when you get excited and nervous.
Now, here.
Do me a favor.
Six months ago, you told me I took too many pills.
Six months ago, you weren't a witness to a murder.
Now, you've been excited. You've been talking a blue streak.
You've been walking around in circles.
I haven't!
Jo, I make my living knowing when and how to administer medicine.
Now I know you'll feel better if you take these. Why fight me on this?
All right, you don't think you will feel better.
I'll make a deal with you.
We'll make a deal.
What is this?
Well, there's something about this Louis Bernard, and the police station, and this whole spy business
I haven't told you yet.
What?
Here's the price of curiosity. What is it?
Come on. Come on. There's one way of finding out.
All right, Dr. McKenna. I'm now relaxed and listening.
Well, there's been something strange about this whole thing from the very beginning.
Now it wasn't any accident that
Louis Bernard came up to us, and helped us on the bus, and started up a conversation.
You were right about him.
You see there?
I know. I know.
That's what I said.
You were right about him.
He was strange.
Yes, I know all that. But what were you going to tell me?
He started to talk to us, and the reason he started to talk to us was 'cause he was on the lookout for a suspicious married couple.
There's nothing very suspicious-looking about us, is there?
No, because he was wrong. It was a different married couple.
Oh.
And he was killed before he found them?
No, he found them.
He found them, all right.
It was in the restaurant where we had dinner last night.
And that's one of the reasons he was killed.
You'll be telling me next it's Mr. And Mrs. Drayton.
That's who it was, Jo.
Ben, if this is your idea of a joke, it's not a very funny one.
I think I'll lie down.
Now, listen to me.
Jo.
Now, listen to me very carefully.
That phone call at the police station, that wasn't the concierge at the hotel.
That was a man with a foreign voice, and he told me if I mentioned one single word of what
Louis Bernard told me in the marketplace, that something would happen to Hank.
Hank? Why Hank?
They've taken him away.
But Mrs. Drayton brought him back to the hotel.
Mrs. Drayton never got back to the hotel, and neither did Hank.
But Mr. Drayton...
Listen, Jo.
Mr. Drayton checked out of the hotel 40 minutes ago.
Now, come on, Jo.
Now, sit down.
I could kill you!
You gave me sedatives!
Jo, sit down.
You did! Let go!
Why didn't you tell me?
I wasn't sure until now.
You did! You did!
Jo, please! Please!
Let go of me! Let go!
Ben!
Lie down, Jo.
Lie down, Jo.
Ben, let me find my baby!
Please.
Oh, dear God!
I want my boy!
Jo, please.
Please! Please. Where is he, Ben? Jo.
Forgive me, Jo.
Forgive me.
There's still no word of him, Jo.
The Draytons are definitely gone.
The register in the hotel says they came from London.
Drayton told the concierge he was a college professor.
I don't think there's anything we can do here, Jo.
I can't bring the police in on this thing.
I'd even thought of taking that chance.
But the minute they connect Hank's disappearance with Louis Bernard's murder, then the first thing they'll do is make me tell them what Louis Bernard whispered to me in the marketplace.
That won't do
Hank any good.
I'm going to London.
The Draytons had a private airplane. I found that out.
That's how they got Hank out of here.
It could land anyplace. No trouble with passports or anything.
So we're going to
London to find him.
Jo, now listen to me.
This is what Bernard said.
"A man, a statesman, is to be killed, assassinated,
"in London.
Soon, very soon.
"Tell them in London to try Ambrose Chappell."
That's the fella we've got to find.
And if he knows anything about this,
I'm gonna offer him every penny I have to get Hank back.
The Chappell guy's our only hope. You understand that, Jo?
Now, I've got a car waiting downstairs.
I've paid the hotel bill. We get packed, we'll be all set.
Honey?
We don't have much time. You'll have to get up and start getting ready.
Please, Jo.
Would you just wait, sir, for the press photographers?
Will you come this way, madam?
Jo, darling, love from the fan club!
How could they remember me so well, Ben?
It's been four years since I played London.
You're the kind of gal they don't forget.
Who told them we were coming? Ben, you didn't.
All I did was wire your friends, the Parnells, to get us hotel rooms.
I never figured on anything like this.
Dr. And Mrs. McKenna,
I'm Inspector Edington of the
Criminal Investigation Department.
As things are, there's no need for you to go through the Customs.
Come this way.
How about a photo, Jo?
Hi, Jo!
This way, please.
We want Jo! We want Jo!
We want Jo! We want Jo!
We want Jo! We want Jo!
This is Mr. Woburn.
Dr. And Mrs. McKenna.
How do you do?
How do you do?
What do you people want with us?
Mr. Buchanan would like to have a chat with you inside.
Who's Mr. Buchanan?
Special Branch,
Scotland Yard.
This is Mr. Buchanan.
Dr. And Mrs. McKenna.
How do you do?
Thank you, Woburn.
Do sit down, won't you?
Let me say at once that we're shocked that your son was taken from you in Marrakech, and deeply sympathetic.
Do you know where he is?
Have you heard anything about our boy?
I only wish I could give you some cheerful news, but we might find him quite soon indeed if we work together.
Bernard the Frenchman was sent to Morocco at our request to check up on an assassination plot here in London.
You know, a good agent keeps on staking his life.
He doesn't always win.
Bernard reckoned you were a man to trust.
He relied on you to come to us.
Those people kidnapped your boy in order to keep your mouth shut.
That's right, isn't it?
No, I think they took him for money.
Then why didn't you go straight to your consulate in Casablanca?
Why did you come to London?
Well, I...
Mr. Buchanan...
No, no.
You're convinced that these people brought your son to London.
You're convinced that you can find him off your own bat.
You can't.
It's impossible.
But with the help we can give you, there's a chance, a really good chance.
But they told us not to say anything.
Anything you tell me will be in the most absolute confidence.
Yes, that may be true, but...
Your son is the trump card these people hold.
He's perfectly safe for the moment.
And when they've done what they want, they'll let him go.
Is that the idea?
Are we supposed to just sit here and wait?
No, Mrs. McKenna.
If they consider your boy a nuisance afterwards, I'm afraid...
There's no need for you to try and scare us, Mr. Buchanan.
That's exactly what I am trying to do, scare you.
I'm trying to prevent a man being murdered here in London.
If you don't tell me all you know, you become an accessory before the fact of murder.
Ben, what can we do by ourselves?
Now, wait a minute.
Now, wait just a minute.
You've been working on the wrong McKenna.
Louis Bernard talked to me. He didn't talk to my wife, you know.
Then you tell me.
He was a Frenchman.
He spoke to me in French, and I don't understand a single word of the language!
Ben, maybe they could find those people and Hank.
Maybe. Maybe's not good enough for me.
And I don't think it ought to be good enough for you either.
You act as if you're the only one who's concerned about...
Honey, honey, I didn't mean it that way.
We made up our minds what we're gonna do about this thing.
Now let's try and stick to it.
I'm sorry,
Mr. Buchanan, we'd like to cooperate with you on this thing, but we just can't.
Well, I've got a son of my own.
I don't know what I'd do.
Excuse me.
Telephone call for you,
Mrs. McKenna.
Put the telephone call for Mrs.
McKenna through here, please.
Hello.
Mrs. McKenna?
Yes?
This is Mrs. Drayton.
Do you remember me?
Mrs. Drayton.
Where is our son?
Where have you got him?
He's here with me. You mustn't worry about him, really.
Where's our son?
Where have you got him?
I expect you'd like to speak to him, wouldn't you?
Yes, please! Please.
Hank! Hello, Hank!
Just a minute.
Mommy?
Mommy, is that you?
Oh, Hank, darling, are you really all right?
I'm a little scared, Mommy, but I'm all right, I guess.
I miss you, Mommy.
I miss you so much!
Here. Hank.
Hank, this is Daddy.
Is Mommy crying?
Now, Hank, listen to me.
Where are you?
Where are you?
I didn't mean to make her cry, Daddy, but I'm scared, and I want to see her.
Hank, son, now listen. Tell me where you are. Where are you?
Welbeck eight...
Yeah?
Eight. Go on, Hank.
Hank!
Ben, he was so scared.
It was a London telephone exchange.
Public call box.
West One.
Do I have to say any more? Come on, dear.
You may change your minds.
If you do, this number will find me.
Baggage and airport service for 552 from Paris...
Everything all right, sir? Yeah, yeah.
Your room key, sir.
Thank you.
Oh, uh... Here.
Thank you, sir.
There you are.
It's from the Parnells.
"Welcome home, Jo.
"Look forward to seeing your family, especially the little one."
"With love, from Jan and
Cindy." That's very nice.
"Ambrose Chappell."
There he is, big as life.
"61 Burdett Street, Camden
Town. Gulliver 6198."
What are you going to say?
I'm gonna tell him
I'll keep my mouth shut and offer him all the money we have for Hank.
Operator?
Operator,
I want Gulliver 6198.
I'll get it.
Jo! You look wonderful!
Jo!
When we got your wire,
I couldn't believe it.
What were you doing down in Morocco?
Sightseeing.
You're the perfect answer to what London needs, Jo.
This week's the dullest thing since my first show.
Ambrose Chappell.
Mr. Ambrose Chappell.
Oh, Mr. Conway, I didn't know you were there.
Dr. McKenna. Dr. McKenna.
Welcome to London town, Doctor.
Oh, I am sorry. I knew you were married. But a doctor? How clever.
Especially in such a psychosomatic business.
Jan, will you keep quiet?
Honey, you wouldn't know what psychosomatic means.
I do too. It means when your mind gets sick of your body, it does something to it.
Can't you see the doctor's trying to telephone?
Not at all. It's just some business. It's nothing.
Business is everything.
Shh!
Hello. Hello?
Ambrose Chappell.
I say, is this
Mr. Ambrose Chappell?
Well, my name's McKenna.
Dr. Benjamin McKenna.
I don't think we need to be quiet. Would you like a drink?
I was wondering if you'd be at your address for a little while.
I'd like to speak to you for a few minutes.
Yes. Thank you.
I'll be right over.
I'd like all of you to meet my husband.
I've heard so much about you, Doctor.
It's nice to see you in person.
How do you do, sir?
This is Val's wife, Helen.
How do you do?
You look just like those pictures
Jo had in her dressing room four years ago.
Haven't changed a bit.
Why should he?
He's a doctor.
Probably gets free hormones.
Oh, yes.
I'm Jan Peterson. I sing almost as well as your wife.
And, darling, this is Cindy
Fontaine from Harrisburg, PA.
Oh, Harrisburg.
Been back home lately?
How can I? They know me there as Elva McDuff.
It doesn't quite fit me anymore.
Where's your boy? I'd like to see which one of you he looks like.
He's staying with some other people so we could have a little time by ourselves.
What's his name?
Hank.
Henry, really.
Well, I hope he looks like you and has the doctor's brain.
These flowers are really so lovely. We thank you very much.
Well, I'll order some drinks.
Okay, but dinner tonight's on me, a sort of welcome home for Jo.
I wish I could persuade her to stay a month.
I wish I could,
Val, but I can't.
I'm terribly sorry, but I have an appointment I have to keep.
I wonder if you'd order the drinks, Mr. Parnell.
I'll be back as soon as
I can. Excuse me, please.
Ben, please.
Ben, please.
It's got to be done.
Take me with you.
No, no, no. I can't.
I won't disappear.
For the last time, please let me go with you.
Honey, two people are easier to follow than one.
Now we don't want
Buchanan's men on our tracks, the other people either.
I'm going out through the service entrance.
Yes, sir?
Ambrose Chappell?
Come in.
There's a gent to see you, sir.
Good afternoon, sir. I am Ambrose
Chappell. What can I do for you?
Well, I...
If you gave me your name, that might be a start.
Yes, of course. My name is
McKenna. Dr. Benjamin McKenna.
I phoned you.
Yes, yes.
You are Ambrose Chappell?
Well, I've been Ambrose
Chappell for nearly 71 years.
But I think I understand your problem.
You do?
Certainly.
It happens all the time.
You expected someone else.
Just a moment.
Ambrose?
I think this gentleman wants to talk to us.
Now, Father, why don't you go and have a nice rest?
Hmm?
I have centuries of rest ahead of me, thank you.
Good day to you, sir.
Now, what can
I do for you?
I'm Dr. McKenna.
That name mean anything to you?
No. No, I don't think so.
You've no idea why I'm here?
My dear sir, I haven't the faintest idea.
But your name was given to me by someone I happened to meet in Marrakech.
Yes?
Yes.
Now, I think you know this man, Louis Bernard, a Frenchman.
Louis Bernard?
Come on. Let's stop fooling around.
Bernard told me to come here just before he died.
This man is dead?
You know he's dead just as well as I do.
Now, I've come here with a business proposition.
I don't see how you can turn it down.
Exactly what had you in mind?
You want to talk here?
Certainly.
We have no secrets from our employees.
Okay. Now, in the first place,
I haven't uttered one word of what
Bernard told me before he died, and I never will.
Frankly, I'm not interested in political intrigue.
I don't care who you fellows are gonna kill here in London.
All I want is that boy, and I'll take the next airplane back to America.
Come on, please.
Listen to me, will you?
Honestly, if money means anything to you, I'll do...
Father, call the police quick.
Now, sir, I shall we go into this a little more carefully...
Wait just a minute.
You told him to call the police. No, no. No, no.
What's the idea, trying to bluff me?
My dear sir, there can be no...
Let me go.
Are you sure you don't know Louis Bernard?
I've never heard of him.
You've got no idea what happened yesterday in Marrakech or where my boy is?
Of course not.
Where is he?
William! Edgar!
Davis! Help!
Now, wait a minute! Wait! All right, now, hold on. Wait. Listen.
It's obvious I'm in the wrong place.
Now, all right, let go of me. Come on.
Come on. Listen.
Wait.
Come on.
I made a mistake.
Now let me go.
Hold him! Hold him!
The police are coming.
Ow!
Hold him.
He said that no matter how
Bud Flanagan was got up, even if he was dressed by Hartnell, that nobody would ever believe that he was an aristocrat.
So I said,
"Listen, Chris,
"why don't you take William
Hickey's column out of the paper?"
Jo? Jo, what's become of that unpredictable husband of yours?
He's been gone over an hour now.
He went to see some man.
What was it? Church?
No. No, it was Chappell.
It's not a man.
It's a place.
It's Ambrose Chapel!
Val, do they list chapels in the directory?
Let's take a look.
Please help me find it.
Let's see. Here we are.
Ambrose. Here we have a chap...
Ambrose Chapel,
17 Ambrose Street West Two.
17 Ambrose Street,
West Two.
17 Ambrose Street.
Look, darlings, I have to go. I'm very sorry.
Have another drink, and I'll be back as soon as I can.
And explain to Ben when he comes in, would you?
Explain what?
Explain what?
Look, there's something weird going on here, and I can't quite follow it.
Let's try to figure the whole thing out.
First of all, there was a man named...
Ambrose Chappell.
And Ben dashed off to see him.
Then Jo said it wasn't a man but a place, and she dashed off.
Don't mention it again, darling, or I might dash off.
Ooh! What a temptation.
Can you fathom it, though?
It's probably some new American gag.
I'll have to ask
Danny about it.
Well, hello again.
Oh!
I'm awfully sorry
I had to rush off, but it was something that had to be done.
Oh, boy,
I can use this.
Thank you.
Well, I...
Where's Jo? She's gone to Ambrose Chapel.
I just came from there.
Hey, not your
Ambrose Chappell.
It isn't a he. It's an it, a building.
She just left
20 minutes ago.
She... What?
What do you mean?
Where's the address?
I'll look it up again.
What is this? You say it's a building?
Yes, here it is.
Ambrose Chapel,
17 Ambrose Street,
Bayswater.
Yes? Doctor! Doctor, come back! It's Jo.
Jo?
Ben?
What happened?
Did you find anything?
No, it was a wild goose chase.
Darling, it must be the chapel. I've found it.
It's just a short way from here.
I know it was crazy thing to do, but...
Honey, I know the address. You wait there. I'll be right over.
All right,
I'll meet you outside.
Bye, dear.
What did you say that address was again?
17 Ambrose Street,
Bayswater.
I don't know how to thank you.
Three men. You don't know much about checkers, do you?
You'd better go to bed, dear, or you'll be overtired.
Can I finish?
I'm winning.
Yes, finish.
Edna, see he has some milk and biscuits.
He'd better be put to sleep again, honey. I've got to get downstairs.
No, it's not necessary tonight.
You'll sleep, Hank, won't you?
I guess so.
Hurry up if you want to finish this game.
Look, it doesn't hurt to be kind, does it?
Give me a yell when you want me to unlock the door.
Can I come in?
- Yes.
I wish it was tomorrow.
That's not a very orthodox sentiment.
Before I forget.
Here you are, my friend.
Two tickets for the concert at the
Albert Hall with my compliments.
Your box is nicely placed.
Or should we say, strategically placed.
And now, for the most important part.
What is it?
A record of the delightful piece they're going to play this evening.
Music's less in your line than marksmanship.
If you listen,
I'm going to play you the exact moment at which you can shoot.
So listen carefully.
We'll have it once more. Listen for the crash of the cymbals.
You see?
At such a moment, your shot will never be heard.
Even the listeners will be undisturbed.
I think the composer would've appreciated that, don't you?
No one will know.
No one except one.
That's right. If you're clever, my friend.
Now, any questions, musical or otherwise?
No.
There's one comforting thought.
It happens early in the evening.
And I hope
I shan't upset you if I tell you you've only time for one shot.
If you need another, the risk is yours.
I don't take risks.
I'm very glad to hear that.
Traipsing all the way to Marrakech for you,
I should like you to do me credit.
Your distinguished target is already on his way.
There's a car waiting for you downstairs in the back entrance.
You're to pick up a Miss Benson on the way.
She'll be your companion in the box.
She'll lend you an air of respectability if that's possible.
Will you have the money when I return?
Don't you trust me?
What is your
English proverb?
"A wolf in sheep's clothing."
A very clever disguise,
I must say.
I think you'd better be going. It's impolite to be late for a concert.
And it would be awkward if they made you wait until the first item was over.
Will you show our friend down to the car, my dear?
Yes, of course.
I'm sorry you have to sneak out by the back way, but we must preserve a respectable front.
There it is.
Yeah. You just may have hit it right on the nose.
And you can't be farther wrong than I was with my Ambrose Chappell.
Come on, let's go.
Ben, should we get some help from the police?
No, honey, please. Let's take a crack at this alone. Come on.
Ben.
Shh, shh.
This is just another wild goose chase
Let's wait
And look around
Look who's coming down the aisle
The subject of my address to you this evening is adversity.
The average life, yours and mine, is often harassed and perplexed by disappointments and by cruelties beyond our control.
Now, strangely enough, it is often these things beyond our control...
That's Buchanan's phone number.
You go out, call him up, tell him to surround this place with police.
What if he asks...
Tell him anything.
This is the time. I'm sure
Hank's around here someplace.
But I don't want to leave you. I know. I know.
I don't know how else to do it, honey. You go on now.
...and therefore the goodness of all mankind.
Few of us pause to consider how life's adversities work in our behalf to make better men and women of us.
But I think we should pause, and pause now, to do a little stocktaking, to look into our own hearts and lives and see what we find there.
Therefore, instead of continuing the service,
I think we should all return to our homes for private meditation, remembering how little we have to complain of and how much to be grateful for.
Next week, I shall discuss the fruits of our meditations.
Until then, my blessing upon each and every one of you.
Well, this is a pleasant surprise, Doctor.
Where's my boy,
Drayton?
He's upstairs.
As a matter of fact, you've come just in time to help my wife with his food.
It seems Hank doesn't care very much for our English cooking.
What do you want?
I'll give you money. I'll keep my mouth shut. All I want is my boy.
And what about your wife?
Did she go outside just to get a breath of fresh air?
Come on. Tell me what you want. I'll do anything.
All right, you'll see your boy all in good time.
Hank! Hank McKenna!
Daddy?
Daddy! Daddy! Daddy!
I'm here, Daddy! I'm here!
My husband's in there now watching them. He sent me out to call you so that you could do something before they get away.
I'm afraid it isn't quite as easy as all that.
Mr. Woburn, my husband is in that chapel waiting for me to bring help. Now you...
May I speak to
Mr. Buchanan?
He told me to call him if I needed him, and I need him right now.
I'm awfully sorry. But I simply can't get in touch with him just now.
He's gone to a rather important diplomatic affair at the Albert Hall.
Well, then call him there!
Please call him.
He's on his way.
I don't know quite how...
Mr. Woburn, it isn't a matter of days. It's a matter of minutes.
Now, you've got to send some...
You've got to send the police right away!
Or do I have to go to Albert Hall myself?
That won't be necessary.
I'll have the chapel put under immediate observation.
By the time you get back, a police car should be there.
Please return to your husband.
Tell him to come straight out of the chapel and let the police take over.
Woburn, Special Branch.
Hold on.
I must ring off now,
Mrs. McKenna.
Please believe me. I'll have everything laid on.
There's nobody there.
Are you Mrs. McKenna?
Yes, but there's something wrong, Officer.
That place was full of people just a few minutes ago, and now there's nobody.
Our orders are to keep it under observation until the Scotland
Yard car arrives.
But my husband is in there.
There were 30 or 40 people...
When was this?
It was no more than five minutes ago.
Let's take a look.
I've tried the door.
It's locked.
We'll have to force it open.
I'm sorry, madam.
We can't break in.
Requires a search warrant.
It's the law, you see.
Well, can't we get one?
That all takes time.
We'll have a look around, shall we?
Matthews, take the other end.
All right.
There's no one there.
Are you quite certain this place was full of people only a few minutes ago?
Of course I'm certain. I was there myself sitting next to my husband.
He sent me out to call Scotland Yard.
Look, I'm afraid it's much too complicated to explain why.
We'll just have to sit tight and wait for the car to arrive from the Yard.
As far as we can make out, there's no sign of life.
Report back here.
I see.
Very good, sir.
Walden, you stand by till the car arrives from the Yard.
That's all, Matthews.
You're not leaving?
Orders, madam. Can we give you a lift somewhere?
Yes, take me to
Albert Hall, please.
I'm afraid the Albert Hall's a little bit off our beat.
Suppose we drop you at the nearest taxi rank?
All right.
Wait here.
They're here.
Wait till I clear the kitchen.
Everybody out! Come on. Into the corridor. Five minutes only!
Come on!
Do as he tells you. Come on. It'll only take a minute.
Come on. All of you out.
Why? Why?
All right. This way.
Always something funny going on at this embassy.
Bringing people in secret.
Give me the Swiss embassy anytime.
There's neutrality for you.
Please, may I see the manager?
I'm sorry, madam. The manager's on duty in the lobby.
So is his assistant.
I must speak with one of them.
Which are they?
Over there somewhere.
You have a very nice little boy, madame.
His safety will depend upon you tonight.
Where is he?
Where is he?
Good evening.
Is that the
Prime Minister?
No, that's only the Ambassador.
His Prime Minister's the one with the bald head.
Your ticket, madam?
I'm sorry.
I'm looking for someone.
I saw the gun. He was pointing it at the Prime Minister.
He was going to kill him, and
I realized that I had to scream.
Well, then he didn't kill him?
Your wife saved him. It's only a small flesh wound.
There they are.
Do please come over and let the Prime Minister thank you personally, would you?
I'm sure he'd like to.
It won't take very long.
Would you come along with me? Don't be nervous.
Prime Minister, this is the young lady.
Dear lady, I'm forever in your debt.
This is her husband.
I trust you'll permit me to wait upon you tomorrow.
And to express to you the depth of my gratitude.
It wasn't...
But it was, my dear lady. It was.
Will you excuse us?
Excuse me, but I have to go.
I think Mr. Buchanan would like a word with you.
Where's our boy?
Where's Hank?
We can talk if you'll come in here.
So you both knew the time and the place all along.
Don't be a fool!
An odd coincidence, both of you turning up here.
Yeah, it's a pity you didn't contact your assistant.
He told us both you were here.
I beg your pardon?
We need that help you offered, Mr. Buchanan.
Sir, we've questioned the woman. Said she bought a ticket which happened to place her in the same box with the man who did the shooting.
Didn't know anything. But if she does, she isn't talking.
I'll see her later.
Very good, sir.
Please tell me everything now. Everything.
There's still plenty of room for hope, Mrs. McKenna.
His Excellency will see you now.
And that's that,
I suppose.
Yes. All right.
Excuse me, sir. I have a lot to explain to you.
Something very unusual has happened.
I also have to have the money to pay the marksman.
Wouldn't that be superfluous, considering that he's dead?
His aim wasn't quite as good as you led me to expect.
The target merely received a slight flesh wound in the arm.
Worse than useless.
Then your French friend panicked, made a fatal crash, landing on the floor of the Albert Hall.
I don't see how you can blame me for that, sir.
He was warmly recommended by our people in Marrakech.
I'm glad that you are able to treat the matter so lightly.
I'm holding a reception here this evening.
In a few moments,
I have to welcome our Prime Minister as my guest of honor when I hoped and expected that he would be totally unable to attend.
That amuses you, no doubt.
I don't know what to say.
No.
But I do.
You have muddled everything from the start.
Taking that child with you from Marrakech.
Don't you realize that Americans dislike having their children stolen?
How else could I make sure that
McKenna would keep his mouth shut?
Then to crown it all, you get cold feet and come running along here to hide, bringing the wretched child with you.
Don't you see what you've done to the diplomatic status of this embassy?
I didn't think.
I only thought we could...
How are you going to get the child out of here, eh?
Eh? Eh?
No difficulty about that, surely. The car...
With plainclothes detectives planted right 'round this building?
You English intellectuals will be the death of us all.
I'll think of something.
Only give me time.
Time.
I want the child removed from this embassy and removed in such a way that he won't be able to say anymore where he has been tonight.
Oh, no!
I'll see to it.
Drayton! I trust that nothing will go wrong this time.
It would be very unfortunate for you if...
Yes, come in.
Your Excellency, the princess should be arriving at any moment.
I recognized him.
He recognized me.
He tried to get away, made a jump for it. That was all.
Trying to liquidate one of their own big shots.
I wish they'd stick to their usual custom and do it in their own country.
Yes?
Buchanan speaking.
Right. Thank you.
The Draytons are at the embassy.
The what?
How do you know?
We have means of finding out from the inside.
Well, look, if the
Draytons are at the embassy, then our boy's there too.
You're probably right, but we can't do anything.
What do you mean, you can't do anything?
Every embassy in a foreign country has extraterritorial rights.
What's that?
As far as we're concerned, this embassy stands on foreign soil.
So they can steal kids and get away with it? What is this?
We could have the Foreign Office serve a writ on the Ambassador.
You know, I'm not responsible for the complications of international law.
If only we had some positive proof that your boy really is in there.
Say, what's the phone number of that embassy?
You got it?
What are you thinking about?
Let me try something.
Grosvenor 0144.
Grosvenor 0144, please.
That fellow that got shot's a prime minister, isn't he?
Hello? Hello. I'd like to speak to the Prime Minister, please.
Yeah, yeah. No, look.
Just tell him the lady that saved his life would like to speak to him.
It's very important.
Yeah.
Ben, what do I say?
He wanted to visit with us so he could thank you.
Tell him you want to come over to the embassy right away, tonight,
'cause we're going to leave
London tomorrow. You see?
Hello? Here you are.
Hello?
My dear lady, this is a charming surprise.
Uh-huh.
Delighted.
Delighted, delighted.
The Ambassador too would be delighted.
Any friends of mine are friends of his.
He said all right.
So if he asks you, we're all set. You see?
But supposing they don't?
Honey, have we ever been to a party where they didn't ask you?
Now, your job is to hold their attention, right?
Good evening.
It's Dr. And Mrs. McKenna.
How very nice to see you.
The Prime Minister's waiting for you.
Do come this way, please.
Ah, madame.
Good evening, good evening.
Good evening.
This is the charming lady who saved my life at the concert.
Madam, you saved the life of the one man who's irreplaceable in our country.
I hear you are the famous Jo Conway, madame.
Yes, I'm Jo Conway.
Perhaps we might...
I'm sure my wife would be delighted to sing for you.
Wouldn't you, dear?
Well, it's been quite some time.
I beg you, madame.
A tranquil coda to conclude a dramatic evening.
I'm very flattered.
Uh, Stanis? Would you put up some chairs? And hurry up, please.
Ladies and gentlemen, the famous Jo Conway has gladly consented to sing a few songs for us tonight.
Darling, would you see that the
Prime Minister gets a very good seat?
Would you like to come to the piano?
Would you not like to sit down, sir?
No, thank you. I'll just stand over here.
When I was just a little girl
I asked my mother what will I be
Will I be pretty?
Will I be rich?
Here's what she said to me
Que sera, sera
Whatever will be, will be
The future's not ours to see
Que sera, sera
What will be, will be
When I was just a child in school
I asked my teacher what should I try
Should I paint pictures?
Should I sing songs?
This was her wise reply
Que sera, sera
Whatever will be, will be
The future's not ours to see
Que sera, sera
What will be, will be
When I grew up and fell in love
I asked my sweetheart what lies ahead
Will we have rainbows day after day?
Here's what my sweetheart said
Que sera, sera
Whatever will be, will be
The future's not ours to see
Que sera, sera
That's my mother's voice!
That's my mother singing!
What?
Are you sure, Hank?
Are you quite sure?
That's her! I know it!
What's she doing here?
Hank, can you whistle that song?
I guess so.
Then go on.
Whistle it.
Whistle it as loud as you can.
Will we have rainbows day after day?
Here's what my sweetheart said
Ever will be, will be
The future's not ours to see
Que sera, sera
What will be, will be
Now I have children of my own
They ask their mother what will I be
Will I be handsome?
Will I be rich?
I tell them tenderly
Que sera, sera
Whatever will be, will be
The future's not ours to see
Que sera, sera
What will be, will be
You two wait in the mail room. I'll bring him down.
Give me about five minutes.
No!
Oh, Daddy!
Take the boy. Go! But be quick. You must be quick!
Come on, son.
Go on!
Just a moment, please.
Don't touch him.
I don't think you're gonna do any shooting, Drayton, not with these people downstairs and the police outside.
You're not in a very happy position yourself, you know.
You've got to let the boy go!
Precisely what I'm thinking, my dear.
Now I'm sure you're going to be sensible and help me out of here.
Don't ask me for help, you miserable...
You wouldn't want your father to get hurt, would you, Hank?
Now we're going to walk downstairs together quite casually like three old friends.
Then we're going to take a little stroll as far as the nearest taxi rank.
And I hope there won't be any emotional scenes on the way down.
Do as he says, Hank.
No, the other way.
Shall we be going?
All right, start down the hall, son.
Don't say anything.
Now it's good-bye
And we're facing such lonely tomorrows
So many sunsets
Till there's a sunset
When all at once, you'll be there
Then we'll kiss again
And again
Come on, Hank.
Mother!
I'm sorry we were gone so long, but we had to go over and pick up Hank.
Two Men in Manhattan
It was 3:32 PM on December 23rd...
...when the old 1912 gaslight...
...forgotten by urban planners...
...lit up for the kids on 43rd Street.
An Irish boy, an Italian, a Jew...
The trio neatly symbolized the great glass building on First Avenue...
...known as the United Nations.
There was nothing special...
...about the General Assembly's agenda that day...
...simply a vote in favor of a state seeking membership in the organization.
That's all. And yet...
An empty seat indicated the absence...
...of the leader of a national delegation.
An unimportant fact duly reported by press agencies...
...the world over.
Meanwhile, the new member broadcast his state's gratitude...
...to the world.
In a speech recorded for posterity...
...on wax in lieu of marble.
Soon, news of the absent delegate reached the French Press Agency...
...in New York's Rockefeller Plaza.
NY AFP, how may I direct your call?
Get me the Waldorf.
The absence of the French delegate has been widely noted.
No explanation was offered by the press office.
Was there a reason for the delegate's absence?
No, I've heard nothing,
I was just asking.
Yes, I'm much obliged.
Sorry to have troubled you.
Do you understand?
If there's something new
I'll call you, even at night.
Have a second?
I know it's quitting time...
...but our UN delegate has disappeared.
A missing person?
He wasn't at the session today.
Try to find him.
You're a night owl who knows Manhattan.
You spy on me?
That's nice.
McKimmie may know where
Fevre-Berthier is at.
Delmas is more likely.
The dreadful Delmas?
You have sleazy friends.
I choose my own informants.
That alcoholic photographer revolts me.
Suppose he finds Fevre-Berthier?
Give him a bottle of Bourbon.
He only drinks Scotch.
I'll call as soon as I hear anything.
What brings the great journalist here?
Our delegate has disappeared.
Disappeared? Let's not be overly dramatic!
Was there a reason?
Who knows?
Maybe he was avoiding having to explain a vote against.
Then, considering the voting by the Western bloc...
...the Eastern bloc or the
Afro-Asian bloc...
...it may have been politic not to attend.
So it's routine?
No, Fevre-Berthier's family has been wondering since midday...
...which proves his absence wasn't premeditated.
What's the general view?
No one knows except the family... and you.
What sort of man is he?
The classy type.
That pre-war vintage.
Brilliant.
...when statesmen forgot they were politicians.
Pining for 1925?
Who wouldn't regret the "Roaring Twenties"?
It's only when such men are gone that wars break out.
Where could I find him?
Try his secretary in Greenwich Village.
Sorry to bother you.
I'm with the French Press Agency.
Were there political reasons for
Fevre-Berthier's absence today?
What political reasons?
An abstention perhaps.
The UN has its own information services.
I know: McKimmie sent me.
He said you might be able to help.
I don't see how.
He doesn't confide in me.
Could there be a diplomatic reason?
It's curious the way Frenchmen forget their own adage...
What's that?
Americans use it all the time...
Cherchez la femme
He'd skip out on the UN just to chase women?
Not hitherto, but today maybe.
Who is she?
I don't care.
You mean you don't care... any more?
The insoluble problem of male-female relations is not in my line.
Good evening.
Hi, pal.
Sorry, I'm a bit out of focus.
I need you to stick your head under a tap.
Here you go.
Good morning.
Good evening.
Talking of morals, like your landlady...
Who is Fevre-Berthier's mistress?
Excuse me...
Take your pick.
Which would you say?
I'm not invited.
I just take pictures.
We'll see all three.
To get their autographs?
You guessed it.
Why take that?
I hate to feel alone.
Without a glass or a camera in hand, there's just me.
I know what you mean.
But tonight: No camera, no reporting.
She's like me... hates to feel alone.
Who is she?
Judith Nelson, an actress with the Mercury Theater.
We'll start there.
What's this?
One of my spare wheels.
In short...
I can park here.
American women are very direct.
She must be of English descent... from the Trafalgar Nelson.
- Did you pass her well mister?
- Reasonably.
Who's next?
Virginia Graham.
She's recording tonight at Capitol.
We'll go and see her at Capitol.
I didn't tell you: Fevre-Berthier has disappeared.
Keep it quiet. They think he's with his mistress.
Who?
That's why I got you out of bed.
What's all this about Fevre-Berthier disappearing?
That's what I must find out.
Such things can blow up into diplomatic incidents.
Maybe there's money in it.
For both, clearly.
He's a womanizer?
For the moment.
I know a girl who specializes in diplomats.
Should we visit her?
I doubt she knows anything.
Who knows? Perhaps she can give us a lead.
We'll have to call first.
Forms of prostitution are a measure of civilization.
Who said that?
Delma.
Who is this charmer?
Burlesque dancer.
Where?
In "darkest Brooklyn."
Cheap bags.
Poor girls.
I can see you banging a Salvation Army drum.
And you'd rush in to pass the hat.
Delmas... Five years from now.
It takes a yogi 40 years to reach that state...
...and a monk years of prayer.
He and I?
We can reach beatitude in a few hours.
Stay here and keep watch.
She was Fevre-Berthier's mistress.
Era?
He's dead.
Dead! How? Where?
She won't say.
Don't let anyone in.
Careful. She's very weak.
Quick, I have the keys to her apartment.
Careful. No accidents now.
Did you notice which floor?
The eighth.
Oh, shit!
No news, sir...
Hold on.
The boss is on the other line.
He wants to see you.
Give me your number.
I found Fevre-Berthier...
...and the reason for his absence.
But he's not talking...
...about anything.
It'd like to tell you and the boss in person.
It's serious.
No, nothing political.
Stay there, I'll call you back.
Are you crazy?
You can't do that.
Be quiet.
Hello, Moreau?
No, no details.
You found him?
What?
Dead?
Where are you?
On the left or right?
It's the only door.
I'll stop there.
Is nothing sacred?
Something.
This.
My boss is coming.
I should have stopped you.
A shot on the sofa might bring in twenty dollars.
But, rumpled up on the bed...
...half undressed, next to his cutie's picture.
Do you know what that means?
I'm stunned.
Me too, for different reasons.
Ah, Mister Scruples...
You're nearly 40.
Don't you want to get somewhere?
This is your chance to make a fortune.
I can't do it.
Why not? You started it, not me.
You're the Sorcerer's Apprentice.
You can't stop it now.
It's easy.
Did I come looking for you?
You turned up and hauled me out of bed.
Now we're going to see it through.
To the very end, understand?
Get out of here before my boss comes.
Your boss! To hell with him.
I put everything back just as it was.
Too late.
What happened?
A coronary, or something like it.
What is this place?
His girlfriend's.
We traced him through her.
His? Where is he?
You're not alone in this?
A French photographer helped me.
Which paper?
French Match.
I know your editor well.
Is that right?
I met this man when he left France for London in 1942.
The General sent him back on a mission.
He parachuted in without preparation.
"Blind," as we used to say.
He broke a leg and was thrown into prison.
Interrogated, tortured,
His leg, finally in plaster...
...sentenced to death, under an assumed name...
...he contrived to escape.
Two months later, in London...
He joked about it, like someone else's adventure.
He parachuted into France again.
His exploits were cited by Winston Churchill...
...as the true bedrock of the Resistance.
He worked on opposing fractions...
...like the Communist Party...
...or the Secret Army...
...establishing contacts between them and persuading them to cooperate.
It took more than diplomacy, believe me.
It took faith, too.
That rare faith...
...that makes self-sacrifice easy.
Later, he was arrested under his own name, and deported.
He returned from the camps...
...broken in body but not in heart or spirit...
Yours is an honorable profession,
Monsieur Delmas.
History is no long written, but photographed.
But some pictures can not... must not be...
I never leave film in my camera.
Monsieur Delmas... the man did not die here.
Do you understand?
There can be no photographs showing him here.
How interesting.
What do you suggest?
I'm asking for those pictures.
Though I've never worked for you,
I know your reputation.
You are well-versed in journalistic tradition.
When did a press officer ever surrender documentary evidence?
There is more to journalism than such traditions.
Reporting is not just saying and showing everything.
Not telling, sometimes, might be more honest.
You're against freedom of the press?
It has occasioned many excesses.
Do you remember the scurrilous campaign against a Third Republic minister?
And how it ended?
Too late for suicide this time!
Are you truly as cynical as you seem?
Much more so.
Very well Mr. Moreau, they've gone.
Tell me, what happens if an employee disagrees with you?
We argue, decide who is right.
The perfect democratic organization!
I'll use what influence I have...
...to stop the publication of those pictures.
We want them, Pierre.
How much are they worth?
The minority yields.
That's democracy too, isn't it?
I wish that you saw it our way.
Don't ask too much.
I need you.
You too, Monsieur Delmas.
We can't leave him here.
We'll put him in my car.
The police will find him here.
Dead from heart failure.
To avoid questions about his time of death...
...I'll see that there's no autopsy.
Goodbye Monsieur Delmas, please forget our little differences.
See me at the office tomorrow, Moreau, to settle the details.
Can I drop you somewhere?
I'll get a taxi, thanks.
I'll buy you a drink.
Wait. No one's going to get near this car.
_M_?
At least I'll scoop his picture.
Let's go.
I've got work to do.
You behaved like an absolute prick.
You messed up your once big chance...
...to get rich.
Suit yourself, but I intend to do my job.
I'm going to recoup my losses the best way I know how...
...by taking pictures of the widow.
She doesn't know she's a widow, yet.
So, I'll tell her and get a picture of her crying.
You made me miss out on thousands of dollars.
At least let me earn my living.
Where does she live?
No idea.
What a help.
Let's have that drink.
I'll call for the address.
If you're squeamish, you can opt out now.
And have you say...
"Are you the Widow Fevre-Berthier?"
"I'm not a widow, Sir."
"Want to bet?"
Cut the gutter talk, Pierre.
Pardon the interruption, Madame.
Have you heard from your husband?
No, I haven't.
May we come in?
Have a seat please.
Don't do that, please!
It's ridiculous.
Momma, leave me alone with these gentlemen.
I'll explain later.
Should I thank you for what you did...
...or worry?
How did you find out?
I followed you two all night.
When I saw you at McKimmie's office...
...I knew you were on my father's trail.
I followed them...
Where can I get a taxi?
Use my car.
Where's he going?
I wish I knew.
Tell me about it.
It's complicated.
First, let's check the all-night photo lab on 97th Street.
Tell me about it?
I was conned.
How could I ever imagine he'd give us those photos?
What pictures?
He took them in the apartment...
Judith Nelson's apartment?
You knew about that?
Yes.
But the main this is that mother doesn't. What happened?
He's probably developing them at home.
Let's try the papers.
There must be plenty of other labs in New York.
But how do we catch up with the bastard?
He has a two hour lead.
He'll have sold the pictures...
Probably got the editor of
"Life" out of bed.
If he's really on the ball...
...he'll wait for the early editions...
...to give the "official version"...
...then come out with pictures and the true story.
He was right.
It's a goldmine.
You're having regrets?
I think I know where he'll be...
...gloating over a whisky at the Pike Slip Inn.
You kept the real film and sold it!
You wouldn't hit a guy with glasses, would you?
Let's get out of here, Anne.
Your pal just drove into town,
Mr. McCarthy.
I'll have one more, Toybo.
I'm afraid I'll have to pay my bar bill tomorrow.
- You're good with me, Mr. McCarthy.
- Thank you, Toybo.
- Good night, Toybo.
- Good night, Mr. McCarthy.
Operator.
Operator, I want...
...489 Thunder Bay.
I want to speak to Mrs. Manion.
M-A-N-I-O-N.
This is Paul Biegler speaking.
Iron City 700.
- Will they know when she'll be there?
- No, they don't.
I see. You just leave a message.
Tell her to call this number.
- What do you say there, Counsellor?
- Save your money.
- What's in the brown paper bag?
- It might be a cabbage head.
But it wouldn't be.
You're a very suspicious man.
True.
I'm everlastingly suspicious of...
...andlor fascinated by...
...the contents of brown paper bags.
- Can I sneak a peek?
- You do that, Counsellor.
You do that.
After you sneak a peek, why, you uncork whatever you find.
Shall I pour?
- Your privilege.
- My pleasure, sir.
You fought this soldier by yourself.
You've been drinking alone, Pauly.
I don't like that.
Drop the stone, Counsellor.
You live in a glass house.
My windows were busted a long time ago, so I can say as I please.
- Have an Italian cigar?
- No, thanks.
Those stinkweeds are another sign of your decadence.
Pauly, it's a fact.
Since Mitch Lodwick beat you out of the office of public prosecutor...
...you haven't been worth salt for peanuts.
Not that I don't understand how you feel.
A man who gets beat out of an office he's held for a long time...
...feels his community has deserted him.
The finger of scorn is pointed at him.
None but the lonely hearts shall know my anguish.
Pauly, you are a good lawyer.
You ought to make like one.
Be here ready for clients, not fishing...
...and playing that rooty-tooty jazz.
I'm making a living.
I run a few abstracts and divorce Jane Doe from John Doe every once in a while.
Threaten a few deadbeats.
And in the evening I sit around...
...and drink bourbon whiskey and read law with Parnell Emmitt McCarthy.
One of the world's great men.
That was a kind word, Pauly.
You know, I might have been.
That's one of the reasons I hate to see your talent pushed aside by lesser men.
I look at you and see myself years ago, with the same love for the smell...
...of the old brown books in a dusty office.
Here's a rose, a lily...
...a sweet lupine.
The United States Supreme Court Reports.
What shall we read this evening,
Counsellor?
How about a little Chief Justice Holmes?
Restrain Chief Justice Holmes for a minute.
I might have a client. Waiting for a call.
- Hello?
- Mr. Biegler?
This is Paul Biegler speaking.
Hello, Mrs. Manion?
- What?
- Mr. Biegler?
I'm sorry I missed you.
Did you get my message?
Who? What is that name?
Just a minute, please.
We seem to have a bad connection.
It's a woman named Manion.
Maida took a message from her.
In Thunder Bay? If she wants you to represent her husband, say yes.
- I don't know what it's all about.
- Pretend you do and say yes.
- Hello?
- Mr. Biegler?
This is much better now.
Yes, I can hear you fine.
I waited for your call all afternoon.
Yes, well, I just got in a few moments ago.
You've read about my husband?
Muffy, please.
Yes.
Mr. Biegler, have you read about my husband?
Yes, I have. A little.
Will you defend him?
I don't know.
I'd have to know more about it.
Will you talk to him?
He's in the county jail.
Will you see him in the morning?
He's very anxious to see you.
You've been so highly recommended.
I have?
Yes, someone told him about you.
Will you see him?
I suppose I could.
I'll see him tomorrow morning.
- Would you want me there, too?
- I think that would be fine.
Let's make it about 10:00.
- Thank you so much.
- You're quite welcome.
What's this all about?
A man named Barney Quill raped Mrs. Manion.
Her husband is a lieutenant in the Army.
There's a base in Thunder Bay, gunnery or something.
The lieutenant goes to Quill's place and plugs Quill about five times...
...which causes Quill to die of lead poisoning.
- When?
- A couple of nights ago.
If you hadn't been out fishing in some godforsaken place, you'd have known.
Good morning, Maida.
- There it is.
- What?
The newspaper.
I thought maybe they didn't bring it.
We haven't paid the bill.
Did you get my note?
We may be in the case.
I'm reading up on it now...
...before talking to Lt. Manion.
Doesn't he ever go home?
You mean Parnell?
We were up late last night.
Is that a fact?
I think maybe you'd better cancel all my appointments for today.
What appointments?
People think you've migrated to the woods.
If this refrigerator gets more fish in it...
...it'll swim upstream and spawn all by itself.
May I have your attention for a moment, please?
Yeah.
I went over your cheque-book yesterday.
I can't pay me my salary.
What happened to the fee for the Walkers' divorce?
Help salt a uranium mine or something?
I bought a few bare necessities.
Like a new outboard motor.
I wish I could be classed as a necessity.
- Aren't you going to have any toast?
- No.
I'll call you.
Let you know how things are going.
Now, don't let him pay you off in Purple Hearts.
Those professional soldiers never have a dime.
I ought to know, I was married to one.
Pardon me. Are you Mrs. Manion?
- Hi.
- I'm Paul Biegler.
- I'm Laura.
- How do you do?
- This is Muff.
- Hello, Muff.
The jail's right here.
You're tall!
- Hello, Pauly.
- Hi, Sulo.
You wait here, Muffy.
- Good to see you.
- How're you feeling?
Fine. I guess you've come for the soldier boy?
Yes. Do you think we could talk in the sheriff's office?
Sure, I'll bring him down.
Would you mind taking your glasses off,
Mrs. Manion?
Gee-whiz. Barney Quill do that to you?
More than that. You should see. All over.
You can put them back on, if it's more comfortable for you.
This is Pauly Biegler.
This is the bucko, Pauly.
- Lt. Manion?
- Hello, there.
- Hi, Manny.
- Hello, Laura.
I wonder if you could meet me down at my office about 2:00 p.m.
It's 305 West Barnham.
- Of course.
- Fine.
- Is there anything I can get you, hon?
- I'm all right, hon.
Right in here.
Wanted: The Big 10.
They got the 10 best-dressed dames, the 10 top teams, the 10 top tunes...
...and now the 10 most-wanted.
Don't knock it. That's the American dream.
Those boys made the grade.
You were the district attorney around here, weren't you?
Yes. Ten years.
What's your experience as a defence lawyer?
Not very much.
How do I know you can handle my case?
I guess you don't know.
Shall we talk about it?
I suppose so.
Come on. Don't be so bored.
You know, it might very well be that no lawyer can "handle" your case...
...if you mean getting off scot-free.
You seem to be forgetting:
Barney Quill raped my wife.
I have the unwritten law on my side.
The unwritten law is a myth.
There is no such thing as the unwritten law.
Anyone who commits murder on the theory it does exist...
...has bought himself room and board in the state penitentiary.
Maybe for life.
With that in mind, perhaps we can proceed with a few questions and answers that...
Can I borrow your lighter?
We can proceed with a few questions...
...that might be of some help in your defence.
But probably won't be.
That's a nice lighter.
- How old are you?
- Twenty-eight.
- How long have you been in the service?
- Since '50.
- Have you seen any action?
- Korea.
- Do you have any decorations?
- Plenty.
- Is this your first marriage?
- No.
You're not on the witness stand.
You don't have to answer yes or no.
Just give me the matrimonial rundown.
Is this necessary?
I'll be the judge of that.
My first wife divorced me.
Charged cruelty.
Eating crackers in bed, you know, the usual stuff.
The truth was, she found another guy when I was in Korea.
I met Laura four years ago, in Georgia.
We were married right after her divorce.
Did you know the husband?
He was in my outfit down there.
You mean you were buddies?
I'll withdraw the question.
That's a little old-fashioned.
Have there been any children by or from any of these marriages?
- No.
- Any present prospects?
Not unless Barney Quill started something.
What kind of a gun did you use on Quill?
War souvenir. Luger.
The police have it now.
I suppose you've read the newspaper stories about your case?
Some of them.
- Are they substantially correct?
- Yes.
And you didn't see Quill rape and beat your wife?
No. When she got back to the trailer, she told me what had happened.
How long was it before you went to Quill's and killed him?
I don't know exactly. Maybe an hour.
That long?
The newspapers say your wife volunteered to take a lie-detector test.
Know anything about this?
Only what I read and what she told me.
Do you know how the lie-detector test turned out?
- They didn't tell her.
- Yes, Sulo?
Pauly, we got lunch served for the jail.
Do you want to eat with us?
- Does your sister still cook for the jail?
- Sure, she cooks.
You give her my compliments, Sulo.
I've got a luncheon date downtown.
- Nice going...
- I'll be back after lunch.
I'm sorry if I offended you a while ago.
No, you're not.
Come on, bucko.
Pass the salt, Pauly.
Thank you.
Did you give the lieutenant the well-known lecture?
If you mean,
"Did I coach him into a phoney story?" No.
Maybe you're too pure, Paul. Too pure for the natural impurities of the law.
Could be that you owe the lieutenant a chance to find a defence.
You might guide him, show him the way and let him decide if he wants to take it.
- Want some salt?
- No, I'm not ready.
I'm not the right lawyer for this fellow.
He's insolent, hostile.
You don't have to love him, just defend him.
What's the matter, don't you need a fee?
You know something?
I think you might be a little bit afraid.
- Afraid of what?
- That you might get licked.
You know, there's only one thing more devious than a Philadelphia lawyer...
...and that's an Irish lawyer. Pass the salt.
Put it down!
- Hello, there.
- I usually answer to the name Paul.
Are we gonna have some more jokes?
Not unless you want to be the comic.
- I brought you some cigarettes.
- Thanks.
- Peace?
- Sure.
Fine. Now, Lieutenant...
...there are four ways I can defend murder.
Number 1: It wasn't murder.
It was suicide or accidental.
Number 2: You didn't do it.
Number 3: You were legally justified.
Like protecting your home or self-defence.
Number 4: The killing was excusable.
Where do I fit into this rosy picture?
I'll tell you where you don't fit.
You don't fit in any of the first three.
Why wouldn't I be legally justified in killing the man who raped my wife?
The time element.
If you'd caught him in the act, the shooting might be justified. But you didn't.
You had time to get the police.
You didn't do that, either.
You're guilty of murder, premeditated and with vengeance.
That's first-degree murder in any court of law.
- So I should plead guilty?
- When I advise you to cop out, you'll know.
- Cop out?
- That's plead guilty and ask for mercy.
If you're not telling me to cop out, what are you telling me?
I'm not telling you to do anything.
I just want you to understand the letter of the law.
- Go on.
- Go on with what?
Whatever it is you're getting at.
You're very bright.
Let's see how really bright you can be.
Well, I'm working at it.
Because your wife was raped, you'll have a favourable atmosphere in the courtroom.
The sympathy will be with you if all the facts are true.
What you need is a legal peg...
...so the jury can hang up their sympathy in your behalf.
- You follow me?
- Yes.
What's your legal excuse, Lieutenant?
What's your legal excuse for killing Barney Quill?
Not justification, huh?
Not justification.
Excuse.
Just excuse, huh?
What excuses are there?
How should I know?
You're the one that plugged Quill.
I must've been mad.
- How's that?
- I said I must've been mad.
A bad temper's no excuse.
I mean, I must've been crazy.
Am I getting warmer?
Okay, Sulo. I'm going...
Am I getting warmer?
I'll tell you that after I've talked to your wife.
In the meantime, see if you can remember just how crazy you were.
Is Mrs. Manion here yet?
She's been waiting quite a while.
She's been through all your albums from Dixieland to Brubeck.
What do you think of her?
Soft, easy. The kind men like to take advantage of, and do.
Did you get any money?
- Huh?
- Money.
I haven't decided to take the case yet.
You surprise me, sometimes.
Why? I've been around.
Yeah, well...
- Hi.
- Hi.
I hope you don't mind.
I think we'd better talk.
You're a funny kind of a lawyer.
The music, I mean.
Aren't lawyers supposed to like music?
Not that kind of music.
I guess that settles it.
I'm a funny kind of a lawyer.
Where's your home, Mrs. Manion?
Where'd you go to school?
Where did you grow up?
No place in particular. We moved around.
My father was a boomer.
Construction boomer.
Building dams mostly. Call me Laura.
- Is your family still alive, Laura?
- No.
I have some cigarettes around here someplace.
- Want a cigarette?
- No, I wanted to offer you one.
- You could light it for me.
- Oh, yes.
Here.
That's just like your husband's, isn't it?
He gave me this because I liked the one he had. He's like that.
He gives me presents all the time.
You have a happy marriage?
Yes.
What went wrong with the first marriage?
What went wrong is when I went for Manny.
- That's honest enough.
- It was more than just that.
Like I told you, I grew up on the move, and Jack, my first husband...
...didn't like to move.
He wouldn't even take a transfer.
I was really bored. Manny likes to go.
We're always going.
Whenever we get the chance.
We've been all over.
I'm thirsty.
Water? Or would a beer do?
I think a beer would do fine.
Bring me a bottle of beer, will you?
- Are you married?
- No.
That's nice.
What do you do alone in this house if you aren't married?
It's a family home.
I'm the last of the family...
- There you are.
- Thank you.
- Aren't you having one?
- No, not right now.
There you are.
Could Muff have a little?
In that ashtray, maybe? He loves beer.
You want a beer for the dog?
Well, here we are.
He'll go to sleep now.
- Isn't he cute?
- Yeah.
Well, how about it? Are you ready?
I mean, are you ready to tell me the story?
I know what you mean.
Suppose you tell me everything you told the state police...
...plus, everything you didn't tell the state police.
Where shall I begin?
What time did you leave for Quill's bar?
Right after dinner. About 8:30, I guess.
Manny was late getting home from the firing range. So, we had dinner.
He laid down and went to sleep.
I hadn't been out of the trailer all day, so I took Muff and a flashlight...
...and walked over to the bar.
I bought a drink and played the pinball machine.
Many people in the bar?
Not many. Barney came over and challenged me to a game. For drinks.
How well did you know Barney?
He owned this bar where Manny and I went sometimes, that's all.
- Had he ever made a pass at you?
- No, nothing like that at all.
Was he drinking heavily that night?
He didn't seem to be.
At least, not when we were playing pinball.
Were you with him the whole time you were there?
No, there were other people playing.
What time did you leave the bar?
About 11:00, I guess.
I left by the side door.
Muff was carrying the flashlight.
He carries it in his mouth.
He's so cute, running along with the light shining.
Was he sober?
Muff? Of course he was sober.
You're joking now, aren't you?
Yes, I'm joking. Go on.
Well, Barney came from somewhere, not the door I left by.
He said he was going my way and he could drive me home.
He said the bears were prowling around and I oughtn't to walk home.
The bears come out at night to scavenge.
They're harmless enough, aren't they?
I suppose I wouldn't have been afraid in the daylight, but...
...the dark isn't the same.
Yes, I know.
Now, you got into Barney's car...
I got in and he drove to the trailer park.
He made overtures?
No, nothing.
When we got to the trailer park, the auto-gate was closed.
Mr. Lemon closes it about 11:00, or a little after.
I thanked Barney and started to get out of the car...
...but he said there wasn't any need for me to walk.
That he could drive me into the park on another road.
I didn't know there was another road, but he drove on...
...before I could say yes or no.
- Were you alarmed?
- No, I'm not usually afraid of men.
And anyway, he hadn't touched me or even said anything out of the way.
Doesn't a woman sort of instinctively know when a fellow's on the make?
Sure, but that's only usual with me, with almost all men.
Ever since I was a kid.
You, for instance. You're interested.
But there isn't any reason to be afraid of you. It was like that with Barney.
Mrs. Manion, believe me,
I'm not in the least...
Call me Laura.
Laura, I'm only interested in helping your husband. Nothing more.
I don't mean you'd try anything.
I just mean, it's the way you look at me.
It would be very difficult not to look at you.
The way I dress, you mean?
You don't like it?
I love it. I just love it.
We'd better keep moving along with this thing.
How were you dressed that night?
In a sweater, like this, and a skirt.
And the rest? What about that?
Underneath? I had on a slip and panties and a bra.
No girdle?
I don't need a girdle.
Do you think I need a girdle?
I don't know. How should...
I'm only concerned with the few facts that might be of help to me...
...to defend your husband. That's all.
- Well, I don't wear one.
- Okay, no girdle.
All right. Now, go on.
He turned off the highway into a lane in the woods, and he stopped the car...
...and turned off the lights.
And then he grabbed me and he said,
"I'm gonna rape you." Just like that.
He used those words?
Exactly those words. Muff began to bark, so he threw him out the window.
I could hear little Muffy whining outside the car, all through it.
Barney began to try to get at me and I fought him off as best I could.
But he was terribly strong.
Did you cry out? Did you scream?
Didn't seem to be much use, out there in the woods.
He began to shout names at me like "army slut" and some other names.
Then, he drew back and hit me with his fist.
He hit me again and I didn't fight anymore.
I must've been only half-conscious...
...but I know that he tore my panties off and did what he wanted.
The newspapers said a doctor examined you...
...and he didn't think you'd been raped.
I don't care what the doctor thought, a woman doesn't mistake these things.
All right. Go ahead.
I don't know exactly what happened then,
I must've fainted.
The next thing I remember, the car was moving.
Barney was driving very fast and he was breathing hard.
An ugly, gasping sound.
We were on the main road to the trailer park...
...and he swung in by the gate and stopped.
I opened the door to get out.
Muffy jumped out with a lighted flashlight in his mouth.
Wait a minute.
You said he'd thrown Muff out of the car, back in the woods.
He did, but he must've let him back in.
I don't remember.
All right. You opened the door and Muff got out first.
Before I could get out, Barney grabbed me and said he was gonna...
...tear all my clothes off and attack me again.
I got away and ran.
I could see Muff at an opening in the fence.
He was scooting back and forth with the flashlight.
Barney caught me from behind and I fell to the ground.
He fell on top of me and began to beat me with his fists.
I thought he was gonna kill me.
I screamed and somehow
I got to my feet again and ran.
I went through the opening in the fence, followed Muffy...
...who was running ahead with the flashlight.
I kept following the light until he led me to our trailer.
And you didn't see Barney again?
I never laid eyes on him again, dead or alive.
I think that's enough for now.
I've got lots of time. All you want.
Where can I reach you?
I'm still in Thunder Bay, but I can drive down again in the morning.
- Was there something else?
- No.
- Thanks for letting me play the records.
- You're very welcome.
- Who was that?
- The lady in the case.
You're not gonna take the case?
I don't know. That depends on what Manion has to tell me tomorrow.
He's thinking things out.
That's more like it.
If I take the case, I'll want you in it.
Me? In a big murder case?
The sight of this whiskey-drinking old man at the counsel table would ruin you.
I need you.
You mean that?
Why else would he say it?
I'll be glad to work with you outside the courtroom, but not in the courtroom.
You suit yourself about that.
Either way, I'm gonna have to be able to depend on you.
Will you lay off the booze?
I don't know about that.
Why don't you know?
Do you think I could lay off the booze?
Have you ever tried it?
Try it.
I've never been in a big murder case.
Not once in all my life.
Well, it's up to you, Parn.
Will you be around tonight?
Yeah, I'll be around.
Maida, darling, I might manage it.
I might manage to be a real lawyer again...
...for a little while, anyway.
I tried remembering.
There were still some pieces missing.
I remember...
...going to Quill's bar with a gun.
And I remember Quill's face behind the bar...
...but I don't remember anything else.
Not even going home.
Don't you remember firing the gun?
Five shots. That's a lot of noise to forget.
I remember hearing shots, but they don't seem connected with me.
They seemed far away, like somebody else was doing the shooting.
Lt. Manion, I'll take your case.
Thanks, Mr. Biegler.
There's the little matter of the fee.
$3,000. That's reasonable enough, isn't it?
More than reasonable.
I'll pay you later. I'm broke.
- You're what?
- I'm flat busted.
I don't have $3, much less $3,000.
Can you raise it?
Yeah, as soon as I get out of jail.
Next week's payday,
I'll be able to give you $150.
If you get me off,
I'll give you a promissory note for the rest.
Suppose I don't go along with you unless you pay me half the fee?
I'll have to take a lawyer the court appoints. I got my defence now.
Right? Insanity?
I think I'll stick around and make damn sure you get off.
- Where do we start?
- We're gonna need a psychiatrist.
As neither one of us has money...
...do you think the Army'll stir one up for you?
I know a colonel in the Pentagon. I'll write.
Good, do that. Sulo?
Where are you going now?
I'm going to see your wife, for one thing.
Why? Didn't you see her yesterday?
That's right, I did.
She's a very pretty woman, your wife.
A man gets used to the way his wife looks.
Yeah, I guess he does. I'll see you.
Come on in, Pauly.
You haven't been in here since you vacated.
Hardly recognise the old place?
Mary did it for me.
She just finished a decorator's course.
Smart girl.
- Look at this, a real genuine Picasso print.
- Very nice.
Try this chair.
It sort of does things for you.
Here, sit right down.
Great, isn't it?
"Good for the nerves," they say.
How do you shut it off?
Here we are. Feel better?
I feel all shook up.
I just dropped by to tell you
I've got both feet in the Manion case.
- You're going to cop out, aren't you?
- No.
That's a mistake. It's open and shut.
Maybe. We'll see.
Judge Maitland's in the hospital.
Maybe you'd like a continuance until he gets back.
If we go now, we'll have to try...
...before some grab-bag judge they'll send in.
- I'd rather have Maitland.
- Yeah, so would I.
But, of course, that also means my client lies around in jail another two...
...or three months before the trial.
If you drop the charge down to manslaughter...
...so he can get out on bail, we'll agree to a continuance.
You wouldn't do that if you were still D.A.
I don't know, I might.
I might, since a big fat lie-detector test on his wife has given proof...
...to the rape story.
The jury'll be with him.
How did you know what the lie...
- Bit, didn't I?
- Yeah, you did.
A lie-detector test isn't admissible evidence.
You can't use it.
No, but it carries moral weight.
I wouldn't sit in that chair too much.
It could shake a fellow's brains loose.
I'll see you later.
He remembers you, Paul. He likes you.
He likes the beer in my icebox.
What's the occasion today, a buffalo hunt?
No, I bought these in Arizona when we were stationed there.
Aren't they smart?
We can sit in my car.
Here you are.
Several things have occurred to me.
The undergarments that Barney Quill tore off:
Who has them now? The police?
You mean my panties?
All right, your panties.
I haven't seen them since.
I gave the torn skirt and sweater to the police.
Then I went with them into the woods to look for the panties...
...but we couldn't find anything but my glasses.
Your glasses!
You mean, you were wearing glasses through all that?
I had them in a case in my hand.
I wear them for reading, playing pinball, things like that.
I must've tried to get out of the car and dropped them.
You might be interested to know that your lie-detector test turned out...
...in your favour.
Of course it did.
I could've told you it would.
You weren't worried about it?
No, why should I be?
Would you like to have something to worry about?
Silly.
Like your husband watching us from his cell window?
All right, let's have it.
Did he say something to you?
Just enough. Are you afraid of him?
Yes.
Is that why you volunteered for a lie-detector test? For him?
Yeah.
Does he have reason to be jealous?
He was jealous even before we were married.
I should've known how it would be.
It's funny, though.
He likes to show me off.
He likes me to dress the way I do, and then he gets furious...
...if a man pays any attention to me.
I've tried to leave him, but I can't.
He begs, I give in.
Now, if you think
I've forgotten my question, I haven't.
I have.
Then I'll ask it again. Does your husband have any reason to be jealous?
No. Not once.
Not ever.
Like the place all right?
I was just looking at those pictures.
That was Barney Quill, wasn't it?
- That's right. Barney Quill.
- I'm Paul Biegler...
I know who you are.
I've seen you around Iron City.
You didn't tell me your name.
Paquette. We don't open till 5:00.
That's all right. I can wait.
I don't have the shakes yet.
You were on the job that night, weren't you?
The night Barney Quill was killed.
Like the newspaper said, I was present.
You were the fellow that stopped Lt. Manion outside.
That's right.
He pointed the gun at me and said,
"You want some too, buster?"
And you said no, because your name isn't Buster.
Wasn't anything funny about it.
No, there wasn't anything... I'm sorry.
Where were you when Barney Quill was killed?
I gather you don't want to talk about that night?
That's right. I don't want to talk about it.
You'll have to talk to me about it in court, why not now?
'Cause I don't have to now.
Reason enough, okay?
Okay.
Old Barney, he was kind of a rugged character, wasn't he?
Ex-prize fighter and muscleman, and fancy with guns.
He paid his debts, ran a clean place.
Me, I liked him.
You run the place now?
No, I just work here.
Mary's running things.
Mary? Was that Barney's wife?
No. He didn't have a wife.
Mary was his manager.
I wonder who's going to inherit the place.
- Mary, I guess.
- Mary again, huh?
What's the matter with that?
You mean, what's the matter with Mary?
I don't know.
Mary what?
Pilant. Mary Pilant.
She's in the back booth.
We don't talk about our customers here, but if we did, which we don't...
That's her. That's Mary Pilant.
Do you know Lt. Manion's wife?
Sure. I know the lieutenant, too.
He's a good officer.
She's all right, too. Friendly, a good kid.
- What do you know? Knock it off.
- I didn't mean anything. She's a dish.
What's wrong with that?
You want this lawyer to get wrong ideas?
What chances has the lieutenant got?
Pretty good, I'd say, with a couple of character witnesses like you.
I'd like to help him out,
I sure would, but we're moving out.
The whole outfit. Berlin.
Tell me, who is this "babe" at the hotel?
Her name is Mary Pilant.
She was Quill's private property.
- Would you like a table, sir?
- Yes, please.
Will you be alone?
No, I'll be joined by two others.
- May I take your hat?
- Thank you very much.
How was the manicure?
Ask me any questions about anybody.
I've got all the dope.
Can you tell me about a woman by the name of Mary Pilant?
Easy. Mary Pilant may or may not have been...
...the mistress of the late B. Quill.
The manicurist is in favour of the mistress theory...
...but the hairdresser is against it.
However, they both agree that some kind of hanky-panky must've been going on.
To be continued.
- Menu?
- Thank you.
- Pretty, huh?
- Yes, very pretty. Well, go on.
There's one story that says that Barney's wild night with Mrs. Manion was...
...somehow triggered by Mary Pilant.
Seemed she'd been seeing some soldier and Barney blew his stack.
He got tanked up and exploded.
- Is Mary Pilant local?
- No, she's a Canadian.
Barney brought her in to dress up the place...
...and she stayed on to manage it for him.
Looks like she's done all right.
It's better than all right.
She's in for the estate.
She doesn't look like a bad sort, does she?
Where?
What do you mean, "where"?
The pretty one with the menus.
This girl, right here?
Miss Pilant, may I introduce myself?
I'm Paul Biegler, attorney for Lt. Manion.
This is Mrs. Rutledge and Mr. McCarthy, my associates.
Could you sit with us for a minute?
- Yes, I can take a minute.
- Thank you.
I'd like to ask you a few things, if you don't mind.
What sort of things, Mr. Biegler?
Like, what kind of man your employer was?
A very nice man.
If that's true, how do you explain what happened with Lt. Manion's wife?
I don't know what happened with Lt. Manion's wife...
...so there isn't anything for me to explain.
Your loyalty to the dead Mr. Quill is very touching.
Barney was well-liked here by everyone,
Mr. Biegler.
It's very generous to overlook his little faults, like raping other men's wives.
If you will pardon me.
The waitress will take your order when you're ready.
Nice to have met you,
Mr. Biegler, Mr. McCarthy, Mrs. Rutledge.
You've just been ginned, Lieutenant.
Manion?
- Any word, Lieutenant?
- Yeah, this. From Washington.
They'll let a doctor come to testify, but there's a string on it.
They want me to go to an army hospital in Detroit for an examination.
Doesn't the Army understand you're in jail on a non-bailable offence?
That's it, as far as the Army's concerned.
I don't know how I can get around this.
I'll try to think of something.
My wife hasn't been here for two days.
- Have you seen her?
- No. Not for a while.
- Where the hell is she?
- You've got other things to worry about.
I'll get in touch with her and tell her you miss her.
Yeah, you tell her that.
- Thanks, Sulo.
- Okay, Pauly.
I know just how you feel, Lieutenant.
I'd be tearing my hair out, too, if I had something like that outside.
Something like what outside?
You know what I mean. Something like that running around on the loose.
Now, what's the big noise, buckos?
It's me, dummy.
I hit my elbow on this lousy iron bar.
You want some rubbing alcohol, maybe?
No, but a little bourbon might help.
Knock it off, buckos!
Let's finish the game, Lieutenant.
Hey, what a crazy lawyer we got!
Hi, Pauly.
That's what they call you, isn't it? Pauly?
That's a crazy name for a crazy lawyer.
- Thanks for letting me sit in, Pie-Eye.
- You're not splitting the scene, man?
- I mean, you're not cutting out?
- No, I'll be back.
Hi, Pauly. Fellas, this is Manny's lawyer.
- Sit down, won't you?
- Sorry, I can't right now.
Mrs. Manion, may I talk to you for a moment outside?
Mrs. Manion? I thought we dropped the formalities a long time ago.
We'd better pick them up again.
This is important.
- All right, I'll go with you.
- All right, come on.
- You're coming back, aren't you?
- Sure, what do you think?
- See you later, Pie-Eye.
- Okay.
Did you get my phone message?
Yeah, but I got busy.
Why haven't you been to see your husband?
I don't see why I have to go every day.
It would be a very good idea if you did.
All right. I'll see him every day.
- Okay?
- No, it's not okay.
- Where's your car?
- I came with them.
- Mine's right over here.
- Now wait, I got friends inside.
Friends or not, you're going home.
Who do you think you are?
I'm the lawyer trying to save your husband.
Remember?
- What's that got to do with...
- You listen to me!
Until this is over, you're going to be a meek little housewife...
...with horn-rimmed spectacles.
You're going to stay away from men, juke joints, booze and pinball machines.
You're gonna wear a skirt and low-heeled shoes.
And you're gonna wear a girdle.
Especially a girdle.
Believe me. I don't usually complain of an attractive jiggle...
...but you save that jiggle for your husband to look at...
...if and when I get him out of jail.
Now, come on. Let's go.
I'm sorry. I really am.
I wouldn't hurt Manny's chances for anything.
Come on.
Is this about where
Barney knocked you down?
Yeah. Right over here.
Over there's the opening in the fence where Muffy...
...was running back and forth with the flashlight.
Where's your trailer?
Up there on the hill.
This is my favourite place.
Sometimes when Manny was sleeping,
I'd come out here and just sit.
I had to get out of that trailer.
I couldn't stand being cooped up all the time.
I'm lonely, Paul. I'm awful lonely.
I wouldn't have gone to that roadhouse if it weren't for that.
Maybe you're getting in some good practise for being lonely.
You think maybe Manny won't get off?
That'll be up to the jury and you never can tell about them.
If he didn't, it'd be one way to end it.
No, I don't mean that.
I may think it sometimes, but I don't really want it.
Hello, sweetie. Did you miss me?
Of course you missed me.
You want to come in, Paul?
You can if you want to, you know.
No, thank you, Laura.
I'm sorry I had to spoil your fun over at that place.
- Good night, Laura.
- Good night.
Hear ye, hear ye.
The Circuit Court for the County of Iron Cliffs is now in session.
You can be seated.
For those of you I haven't met, my name is Weaver.
I'm from downstate and I'm sitting temporarily...
...while your good Judge Maitland is recovering from a severe illness.
There's no need, I think, to dwell at length upon my methods.
One judge is quite like another.
The only differences may be in the state of their digestions...
...or their proclivities for sleeping on the bench.
For myself, I can digest pig iron...
...and while I might appear to doze occasionally, you'll find...
...that I'm easily awakened...
...particularly if shaken gently by a good lawyer...
...with a nice point of law.
We will now take up the criminal docket.
Case Number 1:
The People versus Clarence Madigan.
Breaking and entering in the nighttime.
Will the defendant rise and come forward?
That's me, Your Honour.
"State of Michigan, Court of Iron Cliffs.
I, Mitch Lodwick, prosecuting attorney...
"... come into said county and give the court to understand...
"... that Clarence Madigan, alias 'One-Shot
Madigan,' alias 'Smoky Madigan'...
"... did enter the dwelling of Casper Katz...
"... and did there commit the felony of larceny on said premises."
Does Mr. Madigan have an attorney?
No. A man's got to have money to ask them fellows the time of day.
Mr. Madigan, if you're impoverished, it's my duty to appoint an attorney...
...on your behalf.
I wouldn't bother, Your Honour.
I stole the whiskey. I'm guilty as hell.
It was a full case of expensive bourbon.
Did you sell this whiskey?
No. I drank it.
- All of it?
- You bet, Judge.
Are you aware that it will be necessary to punish you for this crime?
It was worth it.
I'll accept your plea of guilty.
You'll be sentenced later.
- You may now return to your place.
- Thanks, Your Honour.
Case Number 2:
The People versus Frederick Manion.
The charge: Murder.
Paul Biegler for the defendant.
My formal appearance is already on file.
Which of these men is your client,
Mr. Biegler?
None of them.
Mr. Sheriff, will you produce the prisoner?
I'm afraid I can't do that, Your Honour.
Perhaps someone should explain.
I'm not clairvoyant.
The defendant is in Detroit being examined by a psychiatrist.
Shouldn't the court have been consulted...
...before the defendant was allowed to leave its jurisdiction?
We're dealing with the Army in this matter.
They only gave us one crack at one of their psychiatrists.
The court was not present and it was urgent...
...to get the defendant to the psychiatrist.
What does the attorney for the People say?
It was done with my knowledge,
Your Honour.
I've always heard this Upper Peninsula of our fair state...
...was a queer place.
If it's customary here to allow a man charged with first-degree murder...
...to wander about at will,
I don't suppose it behoves an outsider...
...to point out that the law makes no provision for such quaint liberalism.
The defendant is in the care of a deputy and will be returned this afternoon.
We'll formally arraign the defendant on his return.
For the sake of the docket, can you give me a clue as to his plea?
The defendant will waive reading of the information and stand mute.
A plea of not guilty will be entered.
The case of Frederick Manion will be placed first on the trial docket.
Can you hurry it up?
If the judge hears the prisoner was lounging at the railroad station...
...he'll really give it to me.
It'll just take a minute. Come over here.
Lieutenant, how did things turn out?
I was temporarily insane.
- Did he tell you that?
- Yeah.
He said he'd write you a letter, but I took notes on my own.
- The doctor's name was Smith.
- Smith?
Anatole Ludwig Smith or Ludwig von Smith, I hope.
- Name like that would impress the jury.
- Just plain Matthew Smith.
He said when I shot Quill...
...I was suffering from
"dissociative reaction."
Dissociative reaction.
Sounds pretty good, doesn't it, Parn?
What does it mean in English?
It means I had an "irresistible impulse" to shoot Quill.
That's okay, isn't it?
Did he say you knew the difference...
...between right and wrong when you shot Quill?
I don't think he said anything about that.
Is that important?
We'd better not keep the sheriff waiting.
You'd better go.
You ever heard of a Michigan court accepting irresistible impulse as insanity?
No. Maybe we'd better switch to self-defence.
Even Mitch Lodwick would make a monkey out of us on that.
Damn strawberry soda.
- Here, do you want a peanut?
- No, thanks.
Tomorrow is Saturday.
We just have the weekend before the trial.
When do we start working?
Tomorrow morning. Early.
- Pauly!
- Hey, listen to this, Parn.
Never mind that. Just find:
"People versus Durfee,
62, Michigan, 486, year 1886."
That's it. I have it right here in the A.L.R.
Listen.
"The right and wrong test, though deemed unscientific...
"... is adhered to by most of the states, but..." Listen to this.
"But, the fact that one accused of committing a crime...
"... may have been able to comprehend the nature...
"... and the consequences of this act...
"... and to know that it was wrong, nevertheless..."
Dear, sweet, endearing word,
"nevertheless."
"Nevertheless, if he was forced to its execution by an impulse...
"... by an impulse, which he was powerless to control...
"... he will be excused from punishment."
Why, the Michigan Supreme Court did accept irresistible impulse, Parn.
This is precedent.
I think we got a hold of something here.
Good old Durfee, 1886. How about that?
Give me a pad.
By the saints, this strawberry soda pop is beginning to taste like whiskey.
Don't get drunk yet.
We've got to convince a jury...
...that our client was irresistibly impulsed.
Remember that.
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury.
Before we proceed, it will be necessary for me to examine you...
...on your qualifications to sit as jurors.
Please remember that you are under oath.
Are all of you citizens?
Will you please raise your hand if you are not?
Are there any justices of the peace or law enforcement officers among you?
No.
Are any of you related by blood or marriage to a law enforcement officer?
No.
So much for qualifications.
I will now examine for cause.
Does anyone have business pending with the prosecuting attorney, Mitch Lodwick?
No.
Does anyone have business pending with Paul Biegler, attorney for the defence?
No.
Is anyone acquainted with the defendant...
...seated there on Mr. Biegler's left?
Will the defendant's wife please stand?
- Do any of you know Mrs. Manion?
- No.
Thank you, Mrs. Manion.
You may be seated.
Counsel may challenge the jury for cause.
Before counsel's challenge, may I introduce
Mr. Claude Dancer to the court?
Mr. Dancer is an assistant attorney general from Lansing.
Because of the peculiar nature of this case...
...I asked the attorney general for Mr. Dancer to sit with the prosecution.
Your reputation precedes you, Mr. Dancer.
- It's a privilege to have you in my court.
- I'm sure it'll be instructive.
Do any of you have any business pending before the attorney general's office?
No.
I must apologise for my disparaging remarks...
...about the Upper Peninsula and its customs.
I've seldom seen a murder jury selected and sworn in less than half a day.
You've won my heart completely.
Mr. Dancer, you asked for the recess.
What's your problem?
There was a little suggestion
I wanted to make.
By all means.
Since the defence plea is insanity, the prosecution has retained a psychiatrist.
By statute, we have the right to request a mental examination by our own doctor.
Are you familiar with that statute,
Mr. Biegler?
Moderately.
It would only delay things to file a formal petition...
...so why don't we informally agree...
...to ask for an adjournment?
Only a day or so...
...and our doctor can see the defendant.
It would save a great deal of time.
- Yes, I'm sure it will.
- Good.
But, suppose you just go ahead and file that formal petition anyway?
You're a little late, but maybe His Honour will overlook that.
I'd sort of like the jury to see that you think our insanity plea has some merit.
There's no need for our doctor to examine your client.
- I was only following the usual procedure.
- I'm all for it.
Do you wish to file the petition?
- Yes...
- It won't be necessary.
It won't be necessary.
Skirmish over.
Shall we join now on the field of battle?
The body of Quill had sustained five gunshot wounds.
One of the bullets had passed through the heart.
Death, in my opinion, was almost instantaneous...
...and was directly caused by this wound.
Dr. Raschid, may I have your detailed report?
Certainly.
I ask that this report be marked
"People's Exhibit 1" for identification.
So received and marked.
The People hand the defence a copy of the report.
Counsel may cross-examine.
Dr. Raschid, your primary purpose was to ascertain the cause of death, was it not?
Yes.
Yet I read in your report...
...you checked to determine if spermatogenesis was occurring...
...in the body at the time of death.
Objection, Your Honour!
The People call this witness only to show the cause of death.
Your Honour, the entire report was offered as evidence...
...and it contains this information about spermatogenesis.
Overruled, Mr. Lodwick.
The witness may answer.
Yes, I made that examination on the deceased.
Would you tell the court your findings?
Spermatogenesis was occurring at the time of death.
In other words, the deceased, in life, was not sterile.
- He could produce children.
- Correct.
If a woman says she has had intercourse with a certain man...
...who is proven fertile, though no evidence is found in the woman's body...
...could a lawyer, a prosecuting attorney...
...could he use this as evidence that the woman is lying?
Your Honour...
...I object to this line of questioning.
We are not concerned here with relations between a man and a woman.
As long as an examination for spermatogenesis had been made...
...at least we're entitled to know why.
Overruled. You may answer.
Yes, prosecution could use that...
...though it certainly would not be conclusive that she was lying.
Why not?
There could be several reasons why the test on her was negative.
The use of a contraceptive...
...or possibly, there was no completion on the part of the man.
In this post-mortem, were you asked to determine...
...if the deceased had reached sexual climax...
...shortly before death?
- No, sir.
- Could you have determined it?
- Yes.
So, you were only asked to make such examinations...
...that might be useful to the prosecution, but not the defence?
I object, Your Honour.
The question is argumentative.
The defence is trying to impugn the intent of the representatives of the People.
Mr. Biegler, you must be aware that the question is improper.
I withdraw the question and apologise.
The question and answer will be stricken...
...and the jury will disregard both the question and the answer.
That's all.
No redirect.
The People now call Lloyd Burke.
Will the witness step forward, please?
How can a jury disregard what it has already heard?
They can't, Lieutenant.
They can't.
...the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God?
I do.
Will you state your profession, please?
I'm a commercial photographer.
Were you called upon by the police...
...to take photographs of the body of the deceased, Bernard Quill...
...before and after he was removed from the scene of death?
Yes, sir.
Were these photographs of the deceased made by you?
They were.
The recorder will mark these photographs:
"People's Exhibit 2A to 2D" for identification.
Photographs are tendered to the defence for examination...
...and we move their admission as evidence. Your witness.
No questions, no objections.
- He took pictures of me that night, too.
- Just a minute, Mr. Burke.
Mr. Burke, these photographs offered as evidence:
Are they the only photographs you took that night?
No.
The others didn't turn out?
All my pictures turn out.
Of course. I beg your pardon.
Did you give the other pictures to the police?
Yes, sir, I did.
What were they?
Were they side shots or a shot of the moon, perhaps?
Or a black bear scavenging in the Thunder Bay dump?
I object. I can't see how other photographs are relevant.
The photographs were introduced to show...
...that the deceased met with a violent death.
Your Honour, any photograph pertaining to the case would be relevant.
The point is good, Mr. Biegler. Continue.
What were these other photographs of,
Mr. Burke?
Lt. Manion's wife.
These photographs showed how she looked after Barney Quill was killed?
- Yes.
- Your Honour, how she looked is irrelevant.
No evidence has been introduced to connect her appearance to the murder.
- Sustained.
- I'm sorry, Your Honour.
I wanted to be sure the prosecution wasn't withholding evidence.
Now, look here!
I protest to the defence attorney's persistent attacks...
...on the motives of the prosecution.
The jury will disregard the remark made by the attorney for the defence.
There is no reason to believe the prosecution hasn't acted in good faith.
My apologies to the prosecution and the court.
But, Your Honour...
...as long as protests are being made,
I'd like to make a protest myself.
I'm perfectly willing to take on these two legal giants any time, any place.
But, in all fairness, it ought to be one at a time.
I don't want these two pitching knuckle balls at me at the same time.
It seems to me you're batting close to 1000...
...but your point is well-taken.
Whichever attorney opens with the witness...
...he, alone, shall continue with that witness until they are excused.
Thank you, Your Honour.
No more questions.
No questions.
We're doing well, aren't we?
- Where is Parnell?
- Why? Isn't he here?
No, nor in his rooming house.
He hasn't been there all night.
You saw him last. Where is he?
I promised not to tell, so don't ask me.
He hasn't fallen off the wagon?
No. He was sober.
Has he gone somewhere?
He did borrow my car for something.
Your car? That was smart.
He hasn't driven a car in 20 years.
He'll kill himself. Where's he gone?
My word is my bond.
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
You may proceed.
Your Honour...
...the defence notices a third person at the prosecution's table.
We were wondering if the court shares our curiosity about him?
I was about to introduce him.
Your Honour, this gentleman is Dr. W. Gregory Harcourt.
Dr. Harcourt is the People's psychiatrist in this case.
We ask that Dr. Harcourt be allowed to sit at our table as an observer.
What will he observe? The constellation of Taurus or the life of a bumblebee?
He'll observe the defendant.
That's fine.
The defence has no objection.
I just wish to express my relief...
...that the new recruit is not additional legal reinforcements from Lansing.
We call Alphonse Paquette.
Raise your right hand, please.
You do solemnly swear that the testimony you give...
...shall be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth?
- I do.
- Take the seat, please.
Will you state your name, please?
Alphonse Paquette.
- You work at the Thunder Bay Inn, right?
- I'm bartender there.
Were you working the night
Mr. Quill was shot by Frederick Manion?
- I was.
- Were you witness to the shooting?
I was.
Will you tell us in your own words, please, what happened?
I was at a table by the door when Lt. Manion came in.
Did you know Lt. Manion by sight and name?
- Yes, sir.
- Go ahead.
He came in and walked over to the bar and began to shoot.
He shot Barney when he came up to the bar.
When Barney fell, he kept on shooting down at Barney behind the bar.
Then he turned and walked out.
When Lt. Manion entered the bar, how did he appear to you?
Well, he walked slow.
Kind of deliberate.
Did he speak to Barney Quill?
Not a word.
He just walked over and pulled out his gun and "bang."
- And then he walked out?
- Yes.
When he walked out, how did he appear to you?
He seemed just like he did when he walked in.
Like he was the mailman delivering mail.
When Lt. Manion walked out of the bar, what did you do?
It happened so fast,
I guess I was stunned...
...but then I ran after him.
- Did you find him outside?
- Yes, sir. He was walking away.
- Did you speak to him?
I said, "Lieutenant, you'd better not run away from this."
Did he reply to you?
He said, "Do you want some, too, buster?"
Was he pointing the gun at you?
He was holding the gun in my direction, but the muzzle was low.
When he said,
"Do you want some, too, buster?"...
...how was that expressed?
Did he shout it? Was it hysterical?
Was he hoarse? Did his voice tremble?
No, sir. He just said it cool and hard, and looked right at me.
Did he appear to you, as far as you could tell...
...to be in complete possession of his faculties?
Yes, sir, as far as I could tell.
- Your witness.
- Did you see Laura Manion...
...Lt. Manion's wife, in the bar that night?
There he goes again.
This is immaterial and irrelevant.
I don't see what the prosecution's jumpy about. I haven't gone any place yet.
Let's see where he's going before we start objecting, Mr. Lodwick.
You may proceed, Mr. Biegler.
Did you see Mrs. Manion in the bar that night?
- She was there.
- Did Barney Quill leave the bar that night?
- Yes.
- Do you remember when he returned?
Around midnight.
From which entrance did he come?
Did he come from the lobby entrance or from that outside entrance?
It was from the lobby.
- How did he appear to you at that time?
- How do you mean?
You understood the prosecution...
...when he asked about Lt. Manion's appearance.
He was just old Barney, like usual.
You mean, he was just good old, sober, reliable...
...gentle, salt-of-the-earth, friend-to-man Barney?
- What kind of a question is that?
- I withdraw the question.
Mr. Paquette...
...had Barney changed his clothes since he left the bar?
I don't remember.
Might his clothing have been different when he returned?
That is, might he have changed his clothes?
I couldn't say. I didn't notice.
Was Barney drinking that night?
He always had a few shots while talking to the customers.
- He was friendly.
- Sure he was, good old Barney.
How many shots would you say good old Barney usually had?
I don't know exactly.
Wasn't he, in fact, pretty loaded that night?
Objection.
Even if the deceased was dead drunk, it's no defence to this charge.
Sustained. I suggest you get off this.
Mr. Paquette.
What would you call a man with an insatiable penchant for women?
A what?
A penchant: A desire, a taste, passion.
A ladies' man, I guess.
Or maybe just a damned fool.
Just answer the questions, Mr. Paquette.
The attorneys will provide the wisecracks.
What else would you call a man like that?
We can't see the drift of this.
You mean you do see, Mr. Lodwick.
You may answer.
Can you think of another name?
- Woman chaser.
- Try again.
- Masher?
- Come now, Mr. Paquette.
Mashers went out with whalebone corsets and hairnets.
- Did you ever hear the expression "wolf"?
- Sure, I've heard that.
- It just slipped my mind.
- Slipped your mind. Naturally, it would.
Clanking around in there with those rusty old mashers.
Have you ever known a man who you could call a wolf?
- I'm not sure.
- Was Barney Quill a wolf?
- I couldn't say.
- Or wouldn't.
- Objection.
- Sustained.
The question was answered.
He said he couldn't say.
Mr. Paquette, when Barney returned...
...from wherever he had gone...
...did he relieve you at the bar?
- Yes.
- What did he say?
- He said, "I'll take over."
Coming out from behind the bar, where did you go?
I went over to the Pedersons' table.
You testified that you were by the door when Lt. Manion came in.
You were by the door because the Pedersons' table was there?
Yes.
How long was it before Lt. Manion came in?
I don't know exactly. Maybe 30 minutes.
And you remained with the Pedersons all that time?
Yes. They're my friends.
Is there also a window beside that table?
- I think so.
- You think so.
How long have you worked at the Thunder Bay Inn?
Six or seven years.
Does this window beside the table suddenly vanish...
...and then reappear, and come and go in a ghostly fashion?
It's there all the time.
While you were talking to your friends, did you look out the window?
- I might have.
- When you looked out...
...were you looking for something?
- No, I wasn't looking for anything.
Didn't Barney Quill tell you to go to the window and watch out for Manion?
Did he tell you to look out for Lt. Manion?
He did not.
Barney was quite a marksman, wasn't he?
With guns.
He'd won prizes for shooting, hadn't he?
- Yes.
- Did he keep any guns behind the bar?
He might have.
Isn't it a fact that there are three concealed pistol racks behind the bar?
The defendant's plea is one of insanity, not self-defence.
I'm sure Mr. Biegler hasn't forgotten that,
Mr. Lodwick.
You may answer.
Are there concealed gun racks behind the bar?
- Yes.
- How many people know of the gun racks?
I couldn't say.
Isn't it a fact that Barney would sometimes take the guns out...
...twirling them on his fingers, to demonstrate his skill to the patrons?
- I don't remember.
- Try and remember.
Did you ever see him do that yourself?
Once or twice.
That's all, Mr. Paquette.
No further questions.
The witness may step down.
Call George Lemon.
Biegler's going off in all directions.
What's he getting at?
I have a feeling he's afraid of what we'll get at.
Mr. Biegler's putting up a smoke screen for some reason.
- I do.
- Take the seat, please.
- Will you state your name, please?
- George Lemon.
What kind of work do you do?
I'm caretaker of the tourist park in Thunder Bay.
I see the place is clean and orderly.
I check people in and out, lock the gate at night.
What is your authority for these duties?
I'm paid by Mastodon township and I'm also a deputy sheriff...
...just courtesy, sort of.
Did you see Lt. Manion on the night of the 15th...
...the night Barney Quill was killed?
- Yes, sir.
Will you tell the court...
...about how and when you saw Lt. Manion?
About 1:00 a.m., a knock on my door waked me up.
I went to the door and Lt. Manion was standing there.
He said, "You better take me, Mr. Lemon, because I just shot Barney Quill."
I told him to go to his trailer and that I would call the police.
How did Lt. Manion appear to you when he asked you to take him?
He said what he had to and did what I said.
There wasn't any fuss.
Did he appear to be, as far as you could tell...
...in complete possession of his faculties?
As far as I could tell, yes, sir.
Take the witness.
Mr. Lemon, did you go to the Manions' trailer?
Yes, sir.
- Did you see Mrs. Manion at the trailer?
- Yes, sir.
What was her appearance?
She was a mess.
Objection.
No evidence has been introduced...
...to make Mrs. Manion's appearance relevant.
No evidence was introduced to make
Barney Quill's appearance relevant...
...but you didn't object to that.
Is that because you know that Barney Quill bathed and changed...
...after he raped and beat this poor woman?
Everybody in this court is being tried except Frederick Manion. I protest...
This is a cross-examination in a murder case, not a high-school debate!
What are you trying to do, railroad this soldier into the clink?
Mr. Biegler, you are an experienced attorney...
...and you know better than to make such an outburst.
I will not tolerate intemperance of this sort.
If you once again try the patience of this court...
...I shall hold you in contempt.
Sorry.
Your Honour...
...I apologise.
It won't happen again.
The witness' answer will be stricken and the jury will disregard the answer.
Now you may proceed, Mr. Biegler.
Yes, sir.
Mr. Lemon.
On the night when Lt. Manion awakened you and turned himself in...
...had you been awakened before?
- Had anything else disturbed your slumber?
- No, sir.
There were no soldiers singing?
No, sir. Not in my park after 10:00.
There were no women screaming?
Those screams were down by the gate.
Objection!
I see no reason for objecting yet.
Tell us about those screams, Mr. Lemon.
I didn't hear them myself.
Some tourists from Ohio in the park heard them and told me the next day.
Mr. Lodwick?
This testimony is incompetent, hearsay...
...irrelevant, immaterial, inconclusive...
That's too much for me.
The witness is yours.
No questions.
The witness may step down.
Call your next witness.
Detective Sgt. James Durgo.
- Hi, Pauly.
- Hi, Jim.
As soon as we break, you'd better phone that Army psychiatrist.
- Tell him to be here day after tomorrow.
- Will do.
Will you please tell me where Parnell has gone?
Won't do.
You're fired!
You can't fire me till you pay me.
Were you called to Thunder Bay by Deputy Sheriff Lemon...
...on the night Barney Quill was killed?
- Yes, sir, I was.
My companion officer and I were first on the case.
Sgt. Durgo, when you arrived at the Manion trailer, who was there?
Lt. Manion and his wife.
What did Lt. Manion say to you?
He said his wife had had some trouble with Barney Quill...
...and that he'd gone to the tavern and shot Quill.
He asked whether Quill was dead or not, we told him he was.
How did Lt. Manion take this information?
He didn't seem surprised.
What did you do then?
I asked for the gun he'd used.
Did you take Lt. Manion to the jail here in Iron City that night?
Yes, sir. We drove the lieutenant down with his wife.
On the drive to Iron City, did the lieutenant talk about the shooting?
He said that if he could do the whole thing again, he'd still do it.
During all this, at the trailer, the drive to Iron City...
...how did Lt. Manion appear?
He was very quiet most of the time.
Seemed clear-headed.
Would you say he was in complete possession of his faculties?
He seemed so to me.
Your witness.
You testified that Lt. Manion told you that he shot Barney Quill...
...after he had learned that his wife had had some trouble with Quill.
Were these the words
Lt. Manion used: "some trouble"?
No, sir. Those were my words, not his.
Was it your notion to use your own words?
No, sir, it was not.
Was the suggestion to call it "some trouble"...
...made by somebody in this courtroom?
Yes, sir, it was.
Would you tell the court what words Lt. Manion actually used...
...to describe the trouble his wife had?
Objection. We've been over this before.
This would not be relevant to any issues before the court.
The statement "some trouble" came out during the examination of Sgt. Durgo.
Up to now, you've adroitly restricted all testimony concerning Laura Manion.
The cat's out of the bag, it's fair game for me to chase it.
This is a sore point, Mr. Biegler, and it's getting sorer.
I'd like to hear the prosecution.
The burden is on the defence...
...to prove temporary insanity at the time of the shooting.
If the reason for the alleged insanity is important to this case...
...then it's a matter for a competent witness.
An expert on the subject of the human mind.
What the defence is trying to do...
...is introduce some sensational material...
...for the purposes of obscuring the real issues.
Your Honour, how can the jury accurately estimate the testimony being given here...
...unless they first know the reason behind this whole trial:
Why Lt. Manion shot Barney Quill?
Now, the prosecution would like to separate the motive from the act.
That's like trying to take the core from an apple without breaking the skin.
The core of our defence is that the defendant's temporary insanity...
...was triggered by this so-called trouble with Quill.
I beg the court...
I beg the court to let me cut into the apple.
Our objection still stands, Your Honour.
Objection overruled.
Tell the court how Lt. Manion described the trouble...
...his wife had with Barney Quill.
He told us that Quill had raped his wife.
Can you recall what Lt. Manion told you about the rape?
Yes, sir.
He said he'd been asleep since right after dinner.
He was waked up by some noise, screams, he thought.
He got up, opened the trailer door and went outside.
His wife came running out of the dark and fell into his arms.
You saw his wife in the trailer.
How'd she look?
She was a little hysterical.
She'd been pretty badly beaten up.
She had big, black bruises over her face and arms.
Did Mrs. Manion tell you about this rape and beating?
She did.
Did she take you to where it happened?
Yes, the next morning.
Did you find anything?
Any evidence pertaining to the story that Mrs. Manion had told you?
On the lane in the woods, we found tyre tracks and dog tracks...
...and a leather case with some horn-rimmed glasses inside.
We also looked for a certain undergarment of Mrs. Manion's, but we didn't find it.
Will the attorneys for both sides approach the bench, please?
Mr. Biegler, you finally got your rape into the case...
...and I think all the details should now be made clear to the jury.
Do you agree, Mr. Lodwick?
Absolutely.
What exactly was the undergarment just referred to?
Panties, Your Honour.
Do you expect this subject to come up again?
Yes, sir.
There's a certain light connotation attached to the word "panties."
Can we find another name for them?
I've never heard my wife call them anything else.
I'm a bachelor, Your Honour.
That's a great help. Mr. Dancer?
When I was overseas during the war,
Your Honour, I learned a French word.
I'm afraid it might be slightly suggestive.
Most French words are.
All right, gentlemen, back to your places.
For the benefit of the jury, but more especially for the spectators...
...the undergarment referred to in the testimony was, to be exact...
...Mrs. Manion's panties.
I wanted you to get your snickering over and done with.
This pair of panties will be mentioned again in the course of this trial.
When it happens, there will not be one laugh, one snicker, one giggle...
...or even one smirk in my courtroom.
There isn't anything comic about a pair of panties...
...which figure in the violent death of one man...
...and the possible incarceration of another.
Proceed, Mr. Biegler.
Did you give Mrs. Manion a lie-detector test?
Objection. A polygraph test is inadmissible evidence in our courts.
I only asked if he gave the test.
I didn't ask the results.
He may answer that.
I gave her a lie-detector test at her request.
Now, after all this investigation, did you believe Mrs. Manion?
I did.
- Even after the lie-detector test?
- I object to that question.
It constitutes flagrant subterfuge on the part of the defence counsel.
Objection sustained.
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, a polygraph or lie-detector test...
...is not admissible in evidence, because no one has ever been sure...
...that some people couldn't lie to a lie detector and get away with it.
Go ahead.
In any case, Sgt. Durgo, you, yourself, in your own heart and mind...
...are quite convinced of Mrs. Manion's honesty.
- Yes, sir.
- That's all.
Just a moment.
Did you look for the panties elsewhere than the lane in the woods?
We looked in Barney Quill's car and his room in the hotel.
We didn't find the panties.
Do you know why Mrs. Manion requested a lie-detector test?
- I know what she said.
- What was that?
She wanted everybody to believe her story as she knew it would help her husband.
Was that the only reason she gave?
Said she'd already sworn to her husband and she wanted everybody to believe it.
One moment please, Your Honour.
Ask him in what manner she swore.
Did Mrs. Manion say how she had sworn to her husband?
Yes, sir.
She said she had sworn on a rosary.
Sergeant, this lane in the woods:
What's it used for? Where does it go?
It used to be a logging road.
Doesn't go any place, just stops.
Who uses it now?
I think it's a road kids drive down to park.
- It's a lovers' lane?
- I think so, yes.
- The witness is yours.
- No more questions.
The witness may step down.
In view of the evidence concerning rape, which Your Honour has ruled admissible...
...we ask for a 30-minute recess in order that we may...
...bring in a witness we had not anticipated using.
All right, we'll take a 30-minute recess.
Recess.
Why didn't you tell me about that rosary?
We forgot it.
We didn't forget it. Manny said, maybe we shouldn't tell that again.
It might've looked like something else.
Like I didn't believe her.
How much more didn't you tell me?
Everything else.
We told you everything else.
Is that right, Laura?
Yes, everything else.
All right, now get this, both of you:
When you get up on that stand,
I want you to tell the truth.
I don't want you to tell anything but the truth.
Don't try and lie or conceal anything, or you'll get skinned alive.
This fellow Dancer's gonna move in.
Doctor Dompierre, did you have occasion to come to the county jail...
...the night of August 15 of this year?
I did.
- Who called you to the jail?
- The police authorities.
What did they want you to do?
They wanted me to make a test for the presence of sperm...
...on the person of a Mrs. Frederick Manion.
I made the test.
In making this test, what was your conclusion?
Negative. There was none.
Your witness, Mr. Biegler.
In making these tests, did you notice any bruises or marks...
...on Mrs. Manion at that time?
I did.
Were you asked about the reason for these bruises?
I was not.
Where did you do the lab work on your test for sperm?
St. Margaret's Hospital in this city.
- Who worked up the slides for you?
- A technician at the hospital.
Wouldn't it have been better to have these slides worked up by a pathologist...
...or an expert in this field?
Yes, but the police were in a hurry.
I knew this fellow came on at 7:00 a.m.
Wouldn't it have been better to wait for the expert...
...if the possible question of rape hung on the result?
It would've been.
In the newspaper, on the evening of August 16...
...it was stated you found no evidence of rape. Is that true?
It is not true. I made no such statement.
Did you form an opinion as to whether Mrs. Manion had been raped?
- No.
- Why didn't you form an opinion?
It's impossible to tell if a mature, married woman has been raped.
That's all.
Did you have an opinion about whether she'd had any recent relations with a man?
Insofar as no sperm was present...
...it didn't appear that she had had recent relations with a man.
Just one more question:
The fact that no evidence was present in her body...
...does not mean that she was not raped, does it?
No.
Do you know what constitutes rape under the law?
Yes, sir. Violation is sufficient for rape.
- There need not be a completion.
- No further questions.
The witness may step down.
The People recall Alphonse Paquette to the stand.
Your Honour, since counsel for the defence has forced the question of rape...
...it's necessary to take additional testimony from Mr. Paquette.
You're still under oath, Mr. Paquette.
Will you look at Mrs. Manion, seated behind the defence table?
Was she dressed like this on the night of the shooting?
- No.
- How was she dressed?
She had on a real tight skirt and sweater kind of thing, sort of glued on.
She was wearing red shoes with high heels.
Was she wearing hose?
No, she was bare-legged.
- Was she wearing a hat?
- No.
What kind of hair does Mrs. Manion have under that hat?
We'd be very happy to show the court
Mrs. Manion's hair.
Mrs. Manion, would you take off your hat, please?
Thank you, Mr. Biegler.
Mr. Paquette, was she wearing glasses that night?
I think she was when she played pinball.
Considering the tight skirt and the tight sweater and the bare legs...
...what was the result in her appearance?
Would you say Mrs. Manion's appearance was deliberately voluptuous and enticing?
You could pretty much see everything she had.
The defence will concede that Mrs. Manion, when dressed informally...
...is an astonishingly beautiful woman.
Mrs. Manion, stand up, please.
As a matter of fact, it's pretty easy to understand why her husband...
...became temporarily deranged, seeing such beauty bruised and torn by a beast.
I protest.
Mr. Biegler is the least disciplined...
...and the most completely out-of-order attorney I've ever seen.
The jury will ignore Mr. Biegler's oration.
Was Mrs. Manion drinking heavily that night?
I sold her six drinks myself, and then Barney got some more for her.
I don't remember how many.
Would you say that she was tight?
She was high all right.
What did she do to make you think she was high?
She took off her shoes and went barefooted.
When she played pinball...
...she'd swish around to give the machine inkling.
You mean, she was flipping her hips around?
Anything else?
When she made a good score, she jumped up and down and squealed like women do.
She was playing pinball with Barney Quill that night, wasn't she?
What was her attitude toward Barney Quill?
Friendly, I guess.
More than friendly?
- I thought so.
- Why did you think so?
She'd kind of lean on him...
...and a couple of times she bumped him with her hip.
Would you say that Mrs. Manion was making a play for Barney Quill?
Objection. That calls for an assumption on the part of the witness.
Would you say that Mrs. Manion was free and easy with Barney Quill?
I would.
Your witness.
The attorney for the People asked you if Mrs. Manion was "tight"...
...and you said she was "high."
Speaking as a bartender, what's the distinction between the two?
I don't think I understand.
When we say a person is tight, we usually mean they're a little...
...stupid with drink, isn't that so?
I guess that's about it, yes.
If they're high, they're gay and enjoying themselves.
Yes.
In other words, Mrs. Manion was happy.
Is there anything wrong with being happy in Thunder Bay Inn?
Thunder Bay itself is a resort, isn't it?
Swimming, fishing, that sort of thing?
Is there anything unusual about seeing a barefooted woman in Thunder Bay?
So, Mrs. Manion's taking her shoes off in Thunder Bay...
...doesn't necessarily mean she was being unladylike, does it?
- I guess not.
- Yes or no?
No.
You testified that Mrs. Manion was squealing and jumping up and down...
...and "swishing her hips" around the pinball machine.
Was she creating a disturbance?
Was she attracting a crowd?
Were all the men at the bar standing around watching Mrs. Manion?
But you were very conscious of Mrs. Manion.
You were so conscious that you can tell us all this.
Barney Quill was conscious of Mrs. Manion because he was playing pinball with her.
Wouldn't you say so?
So, it seems only you and Barney Quill were acutely aware of Mrs. Manion...
...her actions and her appearance.
Maybe when good old Barney came to get some drinks from you...
...maybe he winked and said,
"I'm gonna take this babe and rape her."
No, he didn't.
Yeah, and maybe you said,
"Do it once for me, boss."
Objection!
Counsel is attacking the witness.
No more questions.
The court's had about all of this dogfight it can take for one day.
I'm sure the jury is equally tired and hungry.
Tomorrow, the defence takes over.
With expedition, prayer, and a little self-discipline...
...on the part of the counsel, perhaps we can reach an end by Saturday night.
Will you adjourn court?
This court stands adjourned until 9:00 a.m. Tomorrow.
He's banged up a little, but nothing else.
We'd like to watch him for a day or so.
How much damage did he do?
He wrecked a gate and a barn door and he hasn't got a driver's license.
He'll have to appear in the J.P. Court when he's able, the old fool.
Speak kindly of the dead.
- Can I have a minute with the corpse?
- Sure, Pauly.
Was it worth trying to kill yourself for whatever it is you've been up to?
How's the trial going?
I'm making a lot of noise.
Dancer's racking up all the points.
Where've you been?
Quill hired Mary Pilant up north of Sault Sainte Marie.
It struck me funny he'd go up there to hire somebody just to work for him.
I've been up there nosing around.
Did you find anything useful?
Not until I looked up her birth certificate.
Born: Blind River, Ontario, 1934, out of wedlock.
Mother was a waitress. Simone Platt.
Father was a lumberjack named Barney Quill.
I'd like to see Miss Mary Pilant.
It's late, mister.
I know. This is important.
- Real important?
- Real important.
Miss Pilant? Sorry if I woke you.
There's a guy to see you.
Says it's important.
- What's your...
- Biegler.
I don't wish to see him.
She said it's not important enough.
You call her back and tell her
I mentioned Blind River, Ontario.
I'll be in the bar.
Drinking, Mr. Biegler, or just snooping?
I'll try a little of both.
What do you say we start out with a beer?
On the house.
That's all you get: A beer.
No questions, no answers.
I'm just a lawyer trying to do my job.
What are you so afraid of, Al?
Sit over there, please.
Miss Pilant, I owe you an apology.
I was a little rough when I was out here before.
I didn't know Barney Quill was your father.
You didn't come here just to apologise.
No, but the apology was part of it.
To tell the truth, I sort of hoped maybe it would thaw you out a bit.
All I want you to do is listen to me, just for a few minutes.
I need some strong evidence to back up
Laura Manion's story about the rape.
The prosecution's gonna attack that story pretty hard.
If the jury thinks she's lying, it could turn the decision against Manion.
Isn't she lying? Barney didn't do what she said he did. He couldn't have.
What did you know about your father?
All I needed to know. He took care of me and my mother for as long as she lived.
He was always there when I needed him.
That's what I know about my father.
Will that back up Laura Manion's story?
I don't want to get at you.
I don't want to hurt you.
I appreciate your affection for your father.
But, as a lawyer, I've had to learn that people aren't just good or just bad.
People are many things.
I kind of have a feeling that Barney Quill was many things.
I don't wanna hear it.
Please, hear me out.
I believe that Barney told Al Paquette...
...what happened that night.
He told him to go to this window and wait for Manion.
Barney stayed behind the bar, next to a gun rack.
Just waiting.
Manion came in and fired the minute he got inside that door...
...and the first shot went through Barney's heart.
Here's what I want you to do.
I want you to try and persuade Al to come to court as a defence witness...
...and tell them exactly what Barney told him that night:
That he'd raped and assaulted Mrs. Manion.
Al wouldn't conceal a thing like that.
Why wouldn't he tell it if it were true?
I don't know.
But I know this:
Everybody loves something or someone.
Me, I love fishing and an old guy by the name of Parnell.
Manion loves his freedom, he'd like to have a little more of it.
Barney loved you, maybe so does Al.
I wouldn't blame him.
But he doesn't want to hurt you.
He doesn't want you to know the truth:
That Barney could be dangerous and brutal.
If you just ask Al...
If you just ask him straight out...
Mr. Biegler knows that Barney was my father.
He thinks you know something about the night my father was killed.
Something you won't tell.
Lawyer, I told you once, I'll tell you again:
No questions, no answers.
Wait, Al.
Did my father rape Mrs. Manion?
Barney wouldn't hurt a woman.
Is there any reason you wouldn't tell me the truth about that?
What reason?
Anything else, Mr. Biegler?
I'm gonna leave a pass for you and Al at the trial.
You might like to watch
Lt. Manion get convicted.
You gonna talk about
Mary being Barney's kid?
No, I'm not gonna spread it around, Al.
Thank you for the beer.
- Good night.
- 'Night.
All right, now let's get at this rosary thing.
It's been testified that your wife swore to you on a rosary...
...that she'd been raped by Barney Quill.
Now, did you ask your wife to swear on a rosary?
My wife was hysterical and she wasn't making much sense.
I thought if I asked her to take an oath on a rosary it might serve to calm her.
Make her think more clearly.
Did the rosary help?
She was able to tell me, in detail, what had happened.
All right, go on from there.
Now, what did you do then?
I had her lie on the bed and I got some cold cloths for her head.
I gave her a drink of brandy.
After a while, she became calm and seemed to go to sleep.
Then I went to the closet,
I got my gun and I loaded it.
- Was it in your mind to kill Barney Quill?
- No.
Then why did you go to the closet and get your gun and load it?
I knew I had to go to his place,
I thought I'd need it.
Why?
I knew Mr. Quill kept guns behind the bar.
I was afraid he might shoot me.
Might shoot you if you did what?
What were you going to do?
I'm not sure.
I remember having some idea of finding him...
...and holding him while I called the police.
Well, that Mr. What's- his-name...
Mr. Lemon at the tourist court was a deputy sheriff.
Why didn't you get him to go with you?
Maybe because he always seemed to be just the old caretaker of the park.
Maybe I wasn't thinking about anything too clearly, except finding Barney Quill.
Why didn't you call the state police before you went to the bar?
I don't know.
I was in sort of a daze.
It was a horrible thing to see what had been done to my wife.
You say you were in a sort of a daze.
When you got to the bar, did you see that the bar was crowded?
I didn't see anyone at the bar except Barney Quill.
He was the only person I saw.
What was he doing?
I think he was just standing there behind the bar.
Did he make a threatening move to get a gun?
I don't know.
He may have, I don't know.
You say you went there to find him, to hold him for the police?
Why did you shoot him?
I don't remember shooting him.
When you left the bar, do you remember
Alphonse Paquette coming up to you...
...saying,
"You'd better not run away from this"...
...and your reply,
"Do you want some, too, buster?"
Remember that?
I seem to have a vague recollection of someone speaking to me...
...but I don't remember what I said or what was said to me.
When did you realize you'd shot Quill?
I was getting a drink of water.
I remember my throat was so dry it hurt.
When I put the glass down, I saw the gun on the kitchen sink beside the tap.
I noticed the gun was empty.
I'd like you to show the court and jury...
...just how you knew this gun was empty.
This gadget here, when it sticks up, you know the last round's been fired.
On the night of the shooting, did you love your wife?
Yes, sir.
Do you still love her?
Very much.
The witness is yours, Mr. Dancer.
How many men have you killed?
Now, wait a minute!
A man's war record, in Lt. Manion's case a great record...
...shouldn't be used against him.
I'm as patriotic as the next man...
...but the simple truth is war can condition a man to killing other men.
I just want to know how conditioned...
...the lieutenant may be to the use of firearms on other human beings.
I don't like the question...
...but I don't see how I can exclude it.
Let him answer.
I know I killed at least four men in Korea.
Three with a hand grenade and one with my service automatic.
I may have killed others.
A soldier doesn't always know.
In these acts of killing, did you ever have a lapse of memory...
...like when you killed Barney Quill?
- No, sir.
- Ever have a memory lapse during battle?
- No, sir.
Were you ever submitted to a constant barrage...
...in a sweat for many hours, constantly under attack?
Many times.
Ever treated for shellshock or war neurosis?
No, sir.
Did you ever experience any unusual mental state during the war?
- I remember having one great urge.
- What was that?
To get the hell out and go home.
You would do well to consider the seriousness of the situation you are in.
Sorry, Your Honour.
I sympathise with the lieutenant.
I expect he has the same feeling about getting out of jail.
The point is that during your service there was never a record of mental disturbance.
- You were always completely sane?
- Yes, sir, that's right.
No more questions.
No redirect, Your Honour.
Step down, please. Call your next witness.
We call Laura Manion to the stand.
- Up these stairs to the right.
- Thanks.
How long after you told your husband what happened did he leave the trailer?
I don't know exactly.
Everything was kind of fuzzy.
I was faint and I lay down on the bed, he sat beside me.
I vaguely remember his getting up and going out.
I remember wondering if he was going for a doctor, and then he came back in.
It seemed like just a few seconds, but it must've been longer.
I must've gone to sleep.
When he came back in, he sat on the bed and he had a gun in his hand.
And I said, "What are you going to do?"
He said, "I think I've already done it.
I think I've killed Barney Quill."
Are you sure he didn't say,
"I've killed Barney Quill"?
No. I remember distinctly:
"I think I've killed Barney Quill."
Then what did you do?
I put my arms around him and began to cry.
I said, "You'd better go to Mr. Lemon."
My husband said, "I forgot about that."
What did he mean? Forgot about what?
He meant he'd forgotten
Mr. Lemon was a deputy sheriff.
And he said,
"Yes, I'll go turn myself in to Mr. Lemon."
I have no other direct questions at this time.
But, since I'm sure it's difficult to visualise the part...
...a little dog played on this night...
...I should like to show the court this remarkable little animal.
Do the People object?
I'm sure if we did...
...Mr. Biegler would declare that we're haters of small, furry animals.
A creature that cannot talk will be a welcome relief.
Bring in the dog.
Thank you, sir.
Will the deputy bring in the dog, please?
Now, you can put him right there.
Come on.
That's a boy!
Now, I'll ask Mrs. Manion to bring a flashlight for the dog.
I'll ask the court to notice that the dog turned on the light.
It's easy to see that Muff doesn't know who his enemies are.
Remove the dog, please.
Witness will resume the stand.
There we go, Muff.
Mrs. Manion, may I congratulate you on your well-trained pet.
May I also say that I'm pleased to see...
...you are not hiding your lovely hair under a hat.
Is the assistant attorney general from Lansing pitching woo...
...or is he going to cross-examine?
Let's get on with it.
What was your occupation before you were married?
Housewife.
You were married before?
Yes, once.
I suppose your first husband died?
No.
Did you divorce your first husband to marry Lt. Manion?
If counsel wants to know the grounds for her divorce, let him ask that question.
- What were they?
- Mental cruelty.
Naturally. How long after your divorce did you marry Lt. Manion?
I'm not sure.
May I refresh the witness' memory for Mr. Dancer?
By all means.
I believe she told me that they were married three days after the divorce.
- Is that correct, Mrs. Manion?
- Yes.
Then unless yours was a whirlwind courtship...
...you must've known Lt. Manion before your divorce.
Yes.
Mrs. Manion, what is your religious affiliation?
I'm a Catholic.
A Catholic in good standing?
No, the divorce, you know.
You were ex-communicated because of the divorce?
Yes.
Wouldn't you say that a Catholic...
...who can blithely ignore one of the cardinal rules of her Church...
...could also easily ignore an oath taken on one of its artefacts?
Say, an oath taken on a rosary?
I don't think that's true.
Wouldn't there be some doubt about the integrity of such a person?
I don't know. All I know is the rosary means something to me.
I see.
I'll pass on to something else.
You testified that your husband came home late on the night of the shooting.
Were you a little angry about his being late?
I guess I was a little put out.
- Did you have an argument?
- Not much. A little.
When you left to go to the inn, did your husband know you were going?
He was asleep.
Was part of your reason for going without his knowledge because you were vexed?
I'd been ironing all day...
Yes, I guess that's true.
Counsel has deliberately cut off my view of the witness.
I'm sorry, Mr. Biegler. I wouldn't interfere with your signals to Mrs. Manion.
I object to the implication I was signalling.
This is the shabbiest courtroom trick
I've ever seen.
You haven't lived, Mr. Biegler.
I ask the court to rule on my objection.
Will you be careful not to place yourself between Mr. Biegler and his witness?
Of course, Your Honour.
Anything else, Mr. Biegler?
You do it again, I'll punt you all the way out into the middle of Lake Superior.
Gentlemen, this rowing has got to stop.
The next one of you that speaks out of turn will have me to deal with.
Now, get on with your cross-examination.
Would you have gone to the inn if your husband had been awake?
He would have gone with me.
Would you have gone alone?
- Not if he didn't want me to.
- Would he have not wanted you to?
I'm not sure.
I don't know how to answer that.
Had you ever gone to the Thunder Bay Inn...
...or elsewhere in Thunder Bay, alone at night?
Yes. Sometimes.
Did your husband know you were going?
Not always. He goes to sleep early and sometimes I'm restless.
Where did you go on these occasions?
I'd take a walk by the lake, or to the bingo place, maybe to the inn.
Did you ever go to meet another man?
No, I didn't. I never did that.
You mean to say a lovely woman like yourself, attractive to men...
...lonely, restless, that you never...
Objection, the witness has answered the question about other men.
Counsel is now making a veiled suggestion to the jury.
I withdraw the question.
On these occasional excursions into the night, did you always return home alone?
Of course.
You testified that the reason you got into Barney Quill's car...
...was that you were afraid to go home alone.
Why were you so frightened on this particular night?
I said that it was because he told me bears had been seen around.
Was this the first time you'd heard that bears came around Thunder Bay...
...to pick up scraps?
Had you seen the bears before?
Yes.
This was just the first time you were afraid of them?
No. I was always afraid of them.
This was just the first time you were enough afraid to allow a man...
...to take you home after an evening prowl?
Objection. The use of the word "prowl" is meant to mislead the jury.
- Sustained.
- I apologise, Mrs. Manion.
I didn't mean to imply that you were a huntress.
Was this the first time you were enough afraid...
...to allow a man to take you home from one of your evening walks?
It wasn't just that. It was...
You should be able to answer that straight off.
That's a simple enough question.
How can the witness answer straight off, if counsel keeps interrupting the answer?
The witness seemed a little slow to me,
Mr. Biegler.
However, let her complete her answers before you interrupt.
In any case, Mr. Biegler's objection has given Mrs. Manion sufficient time...
...to think of an answer.
You've thought of one, haven't you?
What I was going to say was that...
...I didn't want to offend Mr. Quill by making him think I didn't like him.
He'd been very pleasant to my husband and me when we'd been in his bar.
That's very good. Very good indeed.
Your Honour, please.
The attorney for the People will reserve his comments for the arguments.
I will ask you this question, Mrs. Manion:
Was this the first time you had been in Barney Quill's car at night?
Mrs. Manion, did you hear the question?
Yes, I heard.
Yes, it was the first time.
Would you raise your voice a little?
I said it was the first time.
I'm quite concerned about the lost panties.
Would you describe this article of clothing to the courtroom?
They were nylon and had lace up the sides.
There was a store label in them from the Smartshop in Phoenix, Arizona.
What was their colour?
- I believe white.
- You believe?
I have white and pink.
They may have been pink.
You're not sure. Haven't you checked to see which pair of panties is missing?
When your husband came home late and you had this little spat...
...were you already dressed to go out?
- No.
- When did you dress?
After dinner. When he was asleep.
It's been stated you were bare-legged in the bar.
- Is that true?
- Yes.
In your anger and haste to get out of the trailer...
...perhaps you forgot your panties?
Objection. She testified as to what she was wearing.
Sustained.
Do you always wear panties?
Your Honour,
I object to this line of questioning.
Now, it's immaterial what she does all the time.
The night of the attack, she was wearing panties.
That's all we're concerned with.
Mrs. Manion seems a little uncertain about what kind of panties she was wearing.
Since they've not been found...
...I submit that it's possible she wasn't wearing any and has forgotten.
That's all I'm getting at.
You may answer, Mrs. Manion.
Do you always wear panties?
No.
On what occasions don't you?
When you go out alone at night?
Objection. He claims to go after one thing and goes after another.
I'll sustain the objection.
Strike out the last two questions and Mrs. Manion's answers.
Now, Mr. Dancer, get off the panties.
You've done enough damage.
Yes, Your Honour.
Mrs. Manion, is your husband a jealous man?
He loves me.
I'm sure of that, but is he excessively jealous?
How can the witness answer that?
What's the norm of jealousy?
Can you put your question differently,
Mr. Dancer?
Has your husband ever struck you in a jealous rage?
Mr. Dancer's fishing now.
What's the relevancy of this question?
The shoe is squeezing Mr. Biegler's foot.
In his own words, this isn't a debate, it's a cross-examination in a murder trial.
Proceed, Mr. Dancer.
Mrs. Manion.
Did you ever go out socially in Thunder Bay?
A few times.
When your husband's outfit moved there...
...didn't Mr. Quill throw a cocktail party for the officers and their wives?
Didn't your husband strike a young second lieutenant at this party?
There was a little scuffle. It wasn't much.
- What was it about?
- I'm not sure I remember.
- Were you too drunk to remember?
- No, I was not.
I think it was because the lieutenant was cutting in too much...
...when I danced with my husband.
Shortly afterwards, on the veranda...
...didn't your husband slap you hard enough so that you fell against the wall?
He was drinking.
- Wasn't it a jealous rage?
- I don't know.
- Do you remember why he struck you?
- Yes.
Wasn't he enraged because he thought you'd encouraged this young lieutenant?
He might have thought so.
There are witnesses to this.
I'll ask you again, wasn't this a jealous rage?
I guess you could call it that.
Now I'll ask you:
On the night of the shooting, what did you swear?
What oath did you take on the rosary?
It was about Barney Quill raping me.
Why did you swear on the rosary that he'd raped you?
For the reason that he gave:
I was hysterical.
That is why he asked you to swear.
- Why did you swear?
- So he'd believe me.
Why shouldn't he?
Objection. The reason for the rosary has been established.
These questions are immaterial.
No, I think I'll take the answer, Mr. Biegler.
I'll ask you again.
Why shouldn't he believe you?
Because I wasn't making much sense.
Did he think you'd lie about such a thing?
Objection. Lt. Manion has already testified as to what he thought.
Sustained.
Did your husband strike you that night?
Did he hit you that night?
He may have slapped me because I was hysterical.
Didn't you swear to a lie to stop him hitting you?
No. I didn't.
Didn't he beat you at the gate upon your return from...
...lovers' lane with Quill?
Objection. She testified she was beaten by Barney Quill.
- Quiet.
- No more questions.
I think the witness has had enough,
Your Honour.
The witness may step down.
We'll recess for lunch.
Recess until 1:00.
It's all right, you were fine.
Dr. Smith?
I've come to meet you, sir.
My name is...
Sorry, you're mistaken.
Maybe I'm the one you're looking for.
Are you Mr. Biegler?
No, I'm his associate in the case.
Don't tell me you're Dr. Smith?
That's me.
The Army psychiatrist?
Maybe you expected me to be in uniform.
No.
I didn't expect anybody so young.
I'm forty.
I sort of hoped you'd have a beard and wear a monocle.
- Is that better?
- It helps.
You're on the stand this afternoon.
Have you formed an opinion as to Frederick Manion's...
...mental and emotional state when he killed Barney Quill?
- I have.
- And what is it?
He was temporarily insane at the time of the shooting.
At that time, do you believe he was able to distinguish right from wrong?
He may or may not have been.
It doesn't make much difference.
As clearly as you can...
...will you explain
Manion's temporary insanity?
It is known as "dissociative reaction."
A psychic shock which creates an almost overwhelming tension...
...which the person in shock must alleviate.
In Lt. Manion's case, a soldier...
...it is only natural that he would turn to action.
Only direct, simple action against Barney Quill...
...would relieve this unbearable tension.
This is not uncommon.
For example, in combat, some of the more remarkable heroics...
...take place in this state of mind.
Is there another name for this state we might be more likely to recognise?
Yes, it has been known as "irresistible impulse."
A man in the grip of irresistible impulse, would he be likely to go...
...to his neighbour for advice, or call up the police to come to his aid?
Completely incompatible.
Yes, but our man was able to take out a gun and load it...
...before setting out to find Quill.
That was his conscious mind.
But if no gun were available, he would've gone anyway.
How would a man look in the grip of dissociative reaction?
He might appear to be deadly calm, fiercely deliberate.
Would you describe his behaviour as being like a mailman delivering the mail?
Yes. Like a mailman, he would have a job to do and he would do it.
Your witness.
Did you find any psychosis in Frederick Manion?
- I did not.
- Any neurosis?
I found no history of neurosis.
- Any history of delusion?
- None.
- Loss of memory?
- Not before this instance.
Can you spot Mary Pilant?
She didn't come back after lunch.
I think you'd better give up on that one.
Doctor, you stated that the defendant might or might not...
...have been able to distinguish right from wrong...
...but it wouldn't have made a difference.
- Is that what you said?
- Approximately.
So, at the time of the shooting, he could have known the difference?
He might have, yes.
Dr. Smith...
...if the defendant could have known what he was doing and that it was wrong...
...how can you testify that he was legally insane?
I'm not saying he was legally insane.
I'm saying that in his condition it wouldn't have made a difference...
...whether he knew right from wrong.
He would still have shot Quill.
Dr. Smith...
...are you willing to rest your testimony in this case on this opinion?
Yes, I am.
Your Honour,
I'd like to ask for a short recess.
We would like to meet with Mr. Biegler and the court in chambers.
- Mr. Biegler?
- Glad to oblige, Your Honour.
Short recess. The jury will remain.
Someday I'm going to horrify tradition and lay a dense cloud of tobacco smoke...
...in that hallowed courtroom.
What's on your mind, Mr. Dancer?
In view of Dr. Smith's testimony, the defence might like to change their plea.
- Change it to what?
- Guilty, of course.
No, we'll still go for broke.
No one's considered nuts unless he didn't know right from wrong.
- Why don't you get this over with?
- Your Honour, would you turn to page 486?
What's that?
Appears to be a law book, Mr. Lodwick.
I'm sorry, Your Honour.
I make those to help me think sometimes.
- For perch?
- No, it's for frogs.
What case is he citing?
We gig frogs down in my part of the country.
It's the same up here.
I'm a trout man, but this is a new wrinkle I'm gonna try.
They do it a lot down in the bayou.
The idea is to get a great big long pole and a 10-pound line.
Just drift along a high bank in a boat.
Then you see that great big old bullfrog in a crevice, and you float this along...
...in front of him and that old tongue snaps out.
You got frog's legs for supper.
I'll be darned.
Keep it. Try it sometime.
Thanks. I will.
- What is it, Your Honour?
- People versus Durfee, 1886.
Looks like a precedent.
Would you like to read it, Mr. Dancer?
No, thank you. I think I recall the case.
We're hooked, like the frog.
Dr. Harcourt, where did you receive your university training?
Johns Hopkins in Baltimore, Maryland.
And where do you practise now?
I'm the medical superintendent of the Bonder State Hospital for the insane.
It's been stated that dissociative reaction or irresistible impulse...
...is not uncommon among soldiers in combat.
- Do you agree with that statement?
- I do.
But not as it was put by Dr. Smith.
Where would you depart from Dr. Smith?
Dissociative reaction is not something that comes out of the blue...
...and disappears as quickly.
It can only occur, even among soldiers in combat...
...if the individual has a psychoneurotic condition of long standing.
It has been testified here that a psychiatric examination...
...of the defendant showed no evidence of neurosis...
...and no history of dissociative reaction.
You've also heard it testified that the defendant's behaviour...
...on the night of the shooting was cool and direct.
- As an observer, do you remember this?
- Yes.
Have you formed an opinion about the defendant's sanity...
...on the night of the shooting?
Yes. I'm of the opinion...
...that he was in sufficient possession of his faculties...
...so he was not dominated by his unconscious mind.
In other words, he was not in the grip of irresistible impulse.
In my opinion, he was not.
Your witness.
Psychiatry is an effort to probe into the dark, undiscovered world of the mind.
In there, the world might be round, it could be square.
Your opinion could be wrong, Dr. Smith's opinion could be right, is that true?
I'd be a poor doctor if I didn't agree with that.
But, I believe my opinion to be right.
Might you have changed your opinion...
...if you'd examined the defendant like Dr. Smith?
I don't believe so.
But Smith's opinion was made under better circumstances?
If you mean that he was able to examine the man, yes.
Yes. Thank you, Doctor.
That's all, Dr. Harcourt.
Is there more rebuttal?
We're over a barrel, Mitch.
We have to use him.
We call Duane Miller to the stand.
Will the sheriff bring in the witness?
What can he tell?
Nothing.
He can't tell anything.
Raise your right hand.
Do you swear the testimony you give...
...shall be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth?
I do.
State your name, please.
Duane Miller. Most folks call me Duke.
Where do you presently reside?
Across the alley, in the jail.
You know the defendant, Lt. Manion?
I got to know him recently.
His cell's next to mine.
When was your last conversation?
Except for "hello" this morning, it was last night.
Did you discuss his trial last night?
Yeah, some.
Would you tell the court what Lt. Manion said about the trial?
I said, "Are things looking up, Lieutenant?"
He said, "I got it made, buster."
He said, "I fooled my lawyer,
I fooled that head-shrinker...
"... l'm gonna fool those corn-cobbers on the jury."
You're a liar!
A lousy stinking liar!
I apologise for my client, Your Honour.
His outburst is almost excusable since the prosecution has seen fit...
...to put a felon on the stand to testify against an officer in the U.S. Army.
I don't know who is the worst offender:
Manion or his lawyer.
We're close to the end.
In the name of heaven, let's have peace and courtesy for these last few hours.
Mr. Dancer, you will continue your interrogation without comment.
Mr. Biegler, you will not sound off at every opportunity.
The defendant will remain seated and keep his mouth shut.
- Now, go ahead.
- Mr. Miller.
Are you certain that Lt. Manion said:
- "I've got it made, buster"?
- That's what he said.
- Did Lt. Manion say anything else?
- Yes, sir.
He said when he got out, the first thing he'd do...
...was kick that bitch from here to kingdom come.
- To whom was he referring?
- To his wife.
Your witness, Mr. Biegler.
- What're you in jail for, Mr. Miller?
- Arson.
I copped out and I'm waiting for a sentence.
How many other crimes have you committed?
I was in reform school when I was a kid, but that's all.
I'd like to see this man's criminal record.
Do you have his record?
Yes, sir.
Here it is.
Your record shows you've been in prison six times in three different states.
Been in three times for arson, twice for assault, once for larceny.
It also shows you've done short stretches in four city jails...
...on charges of indecent exposure, window-peeping...
...perjury and disorderly conduct.
Is this your true record?
Them things are never right.
How did you get the ear of the prosecution...
...to tell them about this conversation you had with Lt. Manion?
- The D.A. Was taking us to his office.
- Taking who?
Us prisoners, in the jail.
All at once, or one at a time?
One at a time.
Him and that other lawyer took us to his office...
...and asked us questions about Lt. Manion.
Were you promised a lighter sentence if you went on the witness stand?
- The People object...
- Overruled. Answer.
I wasn't promised anything.
You just thought it would help you...
...if you dreamed up this story to please the D.A.
I didn't dream it up.
- You're sure that's what he said?
- I'm sure.
As sure as you were about your record?
I guess I kind of goofed on that one.
I don't feel I can dignify this creature with any more questions.
Take the witness away.
Would you like a conference with your client?
I can see how the last witness was quite a surprise.
No, we don't need a conference.
I'll recall Lt. Manion to the stand right now.
You've heard the testimony of this Miller.
Is any part of it true?
None.
Do you have any idea why he might come here with a tale like that?
No, sir.
Have you ever talked with this man?
Yes.
What did you talk about?
Nothing important.
Certainly nothing about my personal life or my feelings.
That's all I wanted to know.
Lt. Manion.
Have you ever had any trouble with Miller?
What do you mean?
An argument, something like that?
Did you ever attack Miller?
Physically attack him?
Your lawyer can't answer the question for you.
Did you ever attack Miller?
I wouldn't call it an attack, exactly.
I pushed his head against the bars once.
- Why?
- He said something ugly about my wife.
Do you remember pushing or bumping his head against the bars?
Sure. I just told you.
Then this was not dissociative reaction?
- The defendant isn't qualified to answer.
- Sustained.
Lt. Manion.
Wasn't your action against Quill the same as your action against Miller...
...and against the lieutenant you struck at the cocktail party?
All in the heat of anger, with a wilful, conscious desire to hurt or kill?
I don't remember my action against Quill.
How long had you known your wife was running around with Quill?
I never knew anything like that.
I trust my wife.
I suppose you beat her up occasionally just for fun?
Nothing has been established to permit such a question.
He implies things without getting to the point.
Let him ask, "Did he ever beat his wife?"
I'll sustain the objection.
Would you like to rephrase your question?
No, thank you.
I've finished.
Then I'll ask it.
Did you ever beat your wife, on the night of the shooting...
...or at any other time?
- No.
Is there any doubt in your mind that Quill raped Mrs. Manion?
- No, sir.
- That's all.
Step down, Lieutenant.
- Are we hurt?
- We're hurt bad.
Paul.
I know time is pressing,
I don't want to ask for a recess.
I'd like to leave the courtroom briefly.
If it's important, we can be at ease for a minute.
Thank you, sir.
This is highly irregular, Your Honour.
There's no reason to make a federal case out of it.
Thank you, Your Honour.
We now have another rebuttal witness.
The defence calls Mary Pilant.
We must protest this whole affair.
The noble defence attorney rushes to a secret conference...
...and the last-minute witness is brought dramatically in.
It's obviously been rigged to unduly excite the jury.
It's just another cornball trick.
Your Honour, I don't blame Mr. Dancer for feeling put upon.
I'm just a humble country lawyer, trying to do my best...
...against this brilliant prosecutor from the big city of Lansing.
Swear the witness.
Raise your right hand.
Do you swear the testimony you give...
...shall be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth?
- I do.
- Sit down, please.
- Where do you live?
- At the Thunder Bay Inn, in Thunder Bay.
- How long have you lived there?
- For two years.
- What's your profession?
- I manage the inn.
Miss Pilant.
How is the laundry handled at the inn?
It's chuted down to the laundry room.
Where is that chute on the second floor?
Between Room 42 and 43.
Who lives in those rooms?
I live in 42, Mr. Quill lived in 43.
Would Mr. Quill, coming up from the lobby...
...have to pass by that chute on the way to his room?
- Yes.
- Would it be easy for him...
...to drop something into that chute as he passed?
Yes.
Have you ever had occasion to go down into the laundry?
Yes. Part of my job is to sort various pieces of laundry...
...as they come out of the machines.
Would you tell us what you found among the laundry...
...the day after Mr. Quill was killed?
I found a pair of woman's panties.
- What did you do with them?
- I threw them in the rag bin.
When did you learn the significance of those panties?
Here. This morning in the courtroom.
- You went and got them out of the rag bin?
- Yes.
- Did you bring them with you?
- Yes.
I offer this article of lingerie as "Exhibit Number 1" for the defence.
They're white.
They have lace up the side...
...and they're badly torn.
As if they'd been ripped apart by powerful hands.
The label reads:
"Smartshop, Phoenix, Arizona."
If there is no objection, the exhibit will be received in evidence.
That's all.
Did you ever talk to Mr. Lodwick about Quill's death?
Yes. He came to the hotel several times after Mr. Quill was killed.
Did you tell him you didn't believe
Quill raped Mrs. Manion?
Yes, I told him that.
- Did you ever talk to Mr. Biegler?
- Yes.
- In connection with Quill's death?
- Yes.
Did you tell him you didn't believe Quill raped her?
- How many times did you talk with him?
- Twice.
- When was the last time?
- Last night.
Have you now changed your mind?
Do you now believe
Quill raped Mrs. Manion?
I don't know now. I think he might have.
When did you change your mind, last night?
No, it was here, this morning.
When were you given the panties?
Last night?
- Just wait a minute!
- Use the proper form of objection.
On second thought, I don't object.
I'd like the jury to hear her answer.
The witness may answer.
No. I was not given the panties, last night or any other time.
I found them exactly as I said.
Do you know that Quill put the panties in the chute...
...or did you assume it?
- I assumed it.
Had you thought someone else may have put them there?
Someone who wanted them found in the laundry?
I hadn't thought of that.
In the grip of what Mr. Biegler might call "irresistible impulse"...
...you rushed in with the panties...
...wanting to crucify Quill's character?
- No, it was my duty.
- Your pride was hurt, right?
- I don't know what you mean.
He's trying to confuse the witness.
Let him ask a question she understands.
Yes, Mr. Dancer. I, myself, would like to know what you're driving at.
When you found the panties...
...was your first thought that Quill might have raped Mrs. Manion...
...or was it that he might have been stepping out with Mrs. Manion?
I don't know what he means.
Mr. Dancer, once again, I must ask you...
...to put straight questions to the witness.
Here is a straight question, Your Honour.
Miss Pilant, were you Barney Quill's mistress?
No, I was not!
Everyone knows you were living with Quill.
That's not true. Barney Quill was...
Was what?
Barney Quill was what, Miss Pilant?
Barney Quill was my father.
No more questions.
That's all.
The witness may step down.
We will recess for 15 minutes, after which we will hear the closing arguments.
If possible, I would like to charge the jury before nightfall.
Think they're gonna stay out all night?
Can't somebody say something?
What do you want me to say,
Maida, darling?
Tell me we're gonna win.
I'm counting on getting that promissory note from the lieutenant.
I hope we can borrow some money on it.
I need a new typewriter.
Half the time, the "P" and the "F" don't strike on mine.
"Party of the first part" sometimes comes out "arty o the irst art."
Doesn't make sense. It's embarrassing.
"Arty o the irst art"?
I kind of like that.
It has a ring to it.
Twelve people go off into a room.
Twelve different minds.
Twelve different hearts.
Twelve different walks of life.
Twelve sets of eyes, ears, shapes and sizes.
These twelve people are asked to judge another human being...
...as different from them as they are from each other.
In their judgement, they must become of one mind, unanimous.
It's one of the miracles of man's disorganised soul that they can do it.
In most instances, do it right well.
God bless juries.
I don't know what I'd do if I were on that jury.
I really don't know.
Do you?
I loved that, Pauly.
I loved that "humble country lawyer" bit.
You had Mr. Dancer dancing.
I'm afraid he got in the last dance.
That's the best summary I've ever heard.
I liked yours much better, Pauly.
Do you have to play that?
Can't you play Danny Boy or Sweet Isle of Innisfree?
Paul Biegler's office.
Yes, sir. Right away.
They're ready.
Hey, sweetie!
Go on.
- The jury's coming in.
- Yeah, I heard.
You can tell my loving husband
I'll be in the car.
- You're sure he's gonna come out?
- Sure.
He's lucky.
Some people have all the luck.
You can tell him I'm waiting to get kicked to kingdom come.
Hey, sweetie.
I have a souvenir for you.
You'd better keep that.
You might need it again sometime.
You never know.
No, you don't, do you?
I like you, Pauly.
I warn all those present not to interrupt the taking of the verdict.
I will stop the proceedings and clear the courtroom...
...if there is any demonstration.
Proceed, Mr. Cray.
Members of the jury, have you a verdict?
- If so, who will speak for you?
- We have. I'm the foreman.
The defendant will rise.
What is your verdict?
We find the defendant not guilty, by reason of insanity.
Did Maida give you that promissory note?
Right here, ready to be signed by our happy client.
I used to think the world looked better through a glass of whiskey.
It doesn't.
I think I'll keep it this way.
It looks nice.
I got one good thing out of this case:
A new law partner.
If it's all right with him.
He'd be mighty proud to have his name on a shingle with yours.
I guess you're looking for Lt. Manion, aren't you?
He gave me this note for you.
Felt real sorry for Mrs. Manion.
She was crying.
Left a mess, didn't they?
We'd better get busy here.
"Dear Mr. Biegler:
"So sorry, but I had to leave suddenly.
"I was seized by an irresistible impulse.
"Frederick Manion."
How in the world are we gonna face Maida?
Gin.
I knew there was something wrong with that guy.
I never saw a gin-drinker yet you could trust.
Partner, what do you say we go and see our first client?
Who might that be?
Mary Pilant. We're going to administer
Barney Quill's estate.
Now, that's what I call poetic justice for everybody.
Yeah.
This is Alfred Hitchcock speaking.
In the past, I have given you many kinds of suspense pictures.
But this time, I would like you to see a different one.
The difference lies in the fact that this is a true story, every word of it.
And yet it contains elements that are stranger than all the fiction that has gone into many of the thrillers that I've made before.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- Good night, Mr. Rotunda.
- Good night, John.
- Good night, Manny.
- Good night, John.
- Hiya, Manny. How's the family?
- Morning, Stan. Fine, thanks.
- What'll it be, the usual?
- The same.
I'll bring the toast over to the table.
Thank you.
Oh, Rose, did I wake you?
I was awake.
Is something wrong?
Mmm, it's just these teeth.
I haven't been awake all the time.
They hurt, though, huh?
Oh, not much.
I think it's the price that hurts more than anything else.
The dentist told me what it would cost this afternoon.
Yeah?
Three hundred dollars for the four wisdom teeth.
Ooh.
That's a lot of money, but with prices what they are, maybe it's not too unreasonable.
He even gave me a little lecture on evolution on the side.
It seems the human race is growing smaller jaws and having fewer teeth.
But the teeth are ahead of the jaws, and so everybody has more teeth than they know what to do with.
That's why I have four impacted wisdom teeth.
You look just about perfect to me.
If evolution can produce you, it's doing pretty good.
I don't think we ought to complain about a few impacted teeth now and then.
All right, we won't complain about it.
How do we pay for it?
Ah, we've had big doctor bills before this.
I know, Manny, but I thought we'd come to the end of all that.
We borrow money, and then for years we pay out on the installment plan.
It keeps us broke.
What is that, a crossword puzzle?
Ah, it's a little game I play.
I pick the winners of tomorrow's races, and I write my bets down here on the side, see, like this.
And then the next day, I figure out how much I've won or lost.
Oh, I didn't know you liked horses.
It's the arithmetic I like, honey.
I guess it's the musician in me.
You know, musicians are always fascinated by mathematics.
They can't read, but they can figure.
It would be nice if you could win us about $300.
In my experience,
I always pay for what I get.
We won't win any 300, we'll borrow it.
Every time we get up, something comes along, and knocks us right back down again.
That's life, honey. That's the way it is.
I think we're pretty lucky people, mostly.
- Are we?
- Sure, we are.
We're in love.
We've got two good, bright boys.
I've got a job I like.
I think we're doing pretty well, except for this toothache.
You make everything all right again.
- Are we lucky people?
- Sure, we are.
And the luckiest thing that ever happened to me was finding you.
Oh, Manny.
Sometimes I'm so frightened, waiting for you to come home at night.
I always come home, don't I?
We better get some sleep.
- Can you sleep now?
- I think so.
- Will you sit here for a while?
- Sure.
Hmm.
You know you've got some money saved up?
- I have?
- Mmm-hmm.
- Well, where?
- Your insurance policy.
I borrowed against mine, but yours is clear.
Do you think there'd be enough?
I'd have to ask, but I think there'd be enough for most of it.
- Who do you ask?
- I'll go down this afternoon and find out.
Wonderful.
Mother! Mother!
Those kids. Yes?
Yes, what is it?
Will you tell Greg to quit playing the mouth organ while I practice?
- Greg? Greg?
- Will you tell him?
- Gregory?
- Yes, Mother?
Don't play the harmonica while
Robert is playing the piano.
But I was playing the same thing.
- Was he?
- He thinks he was, but...
I was.
I don't want you playing, even if it is the same.
- He hides in the closet and makes noise.
- Robert.
- What's all this?
- Oh, Robert was playing the piano, and Greg was spoiling his music.
- I didn't!
- You did!
- I was playing the same.
- You were not!
You know, Bob, it sounded to me that last part, when Greg was playing, it almost sounded to me like he caught the melody.
- Try it again, Greg.
- I can't do it now.
No, you can only do it when I'm playing.
Now, be fair, Bob.
I know he's trying to annoy you, but he did play something of a Mozart.
- I did, I did!
- Sure, you did.
And you were doing very well till you let him throw you.
I think you got a real gift for it, so maybe Greg has too.
Wouldn't that be fun, Robert?
- Then you could play together.
- Think I did it well?
- Sure you did.
- Sure you did.
But you mustn't let anything throw you off the beat.
You don't wanna pound the piano and then give up.
You were doing very well, except for that.
It says here Mozart wrote it when he was five.
So I should be able to play it. I'm eight.
I'm five, so I should be able to write it.
Tell you what we'll do. This evening, we'll take time for music lessons.
Bob will have a lesson on the piano,
- and Greg on the harmonica.
- Mine first!
Each lesson will be
15 minutes, and Greg's...
Hello?
Hello, Mother.
How's Pop?
Today?
I guess I could, but I've got an errand to do first.
It couldn't be a very long visit.
And I'd have to leave early.
I promised the boys I'd give them music lessons before I go to work tonight.
Look, suppose I get there about 3:30 and leave about 4:00?
Goodbye, Mother.
Mother says Pop isn't very well.
She wants me to come by this afternoon.
I'll go to the insurance office first, then I'll drop in on Pop, and come back as soon as I can.
January 4th is the first date you replied?
That's right.
- You still at 6342, 55th Street?
- Yes, we are.
All right. Will you sign right here, please?
- Is that all I have to do?
- That's all.
- Goodbye, then. Thank you.
- Goodbye.
Thanks.
I wonder if you'd look at this policy for me, and tell me how much we can borrow on it.
- Rose Balestrero?
- Yes. That's my wife.
I wonder, could you wait a minute while I check on something?
Yes. Yes, I'll wait.
Don't look all at one time.
Hmm? I didn't hear you.
I think the man at the window is the one that's been here before.
- The man who...
- Yeah, I'm sure of it.
Miss James?
There's a man at the window, and Peggy thinks that he's the one who held you up.
Says he wants to find out how much he can get on his wife's policy.
I don't dare look.
It is the same man.
What can we do?
Look at him.
I'm not looking at him now, you look at him.
I don't think I can.
What am I gonna tell him?
I'm not going near that window.
- Just look at him.
- I think I'm gonna faint.
Ann.
It is the same.
I'm gonna sit right here.
Talk to him about the policy.
Tell him he'll probably get the loan, but his wife has to come in.
Mr. Balestrero.
- You are Mr. Balestrero, of course.
- Yes.
Um, I can fairly quickly give you the amount that can be borrowed.
This is the figure that corresponds with the number of payments your wife has made.
I've checked the amount.
Yes, I see.
The actual loan, of course, has to have the signature of the policyholder.
- She'd have to come in?
- Yes.
Your wife would have to come into the office.
Yes, I see. Well, she can come in.
About how long would it take to make the loan?
Oh, it'd just be a matter of days.
Thank you very much.
Glad to have helped you.
- Is he gone?
- Yeah.
Where's Miss Duffield?
In with Mr. Wendon.
There's the reason he didn't do anything.
You say that was the man that robbed you a while back, wasn't it?
I'm almost sure it was him.
What did you think?
- I'm sure... She's gone in there.
- Miss Duffield see it?
She said the way he entered the room was so very strange.
He put his hand in his pocket, but all he took out was this folded paper.
He said he just wanted a loan on his wife's policy.
Hmm.
I'll call the home office.
Maybe you and Pop can come over on Sunday?
I hope we can, Manny. It was good of you to come all the way out here today.
- Ciao, Ma.
- Ciao.
I'd appreciate it if you ladies would wait at home.
Stay near a telephone, and I'll call you within the next couple of hours.
All right, let's pick him up.
Well, you know Daddy.
He said 5:30, and he's always on time.
Mom, what time will Dad be home?
- Who is it?
About 5:30, I think.
- Who's calling, Robert?
- It was some man. He didn't say.
What time is it?
It's 5:25.
If he walks up the steps, it'll probably be him.
What do you suppose they call him for short?
Well, his first name's Christopher.
Probably Chris.
Hey, Chris.
Your name Chris?
You calling me?
Is your name
Christopher Emanuel Balestrero?
Yes, it is.
We wanna speak to you.
We're police officers.
What about?
We'd like you to come down to the precinct and help us out a little.
I'm just getting home. I'd like to tell my wife if I'm going anyplace.
Oh, you'd better come along and tell her later.
- Where is it?
- 110th Precinct.
- Won't take long?
- Shouldn't take long.
I'd like to tell my wife.
It's all right, Chris.
Just a routine matter.
Come down to the precinct, we'll tell you about it.
I found this man outside a liquor store.
Sit down, Chris.
- Here?
- Fine.
Now.
Of course, you're wondering why you're here, Mr., uh, Balestrero?
- Yes, I am.
- I'll tell you the whole thing.
There's been a number of holdups in this neighborhood, all pulled off by one man.
Certain people have come forward with descriptions of that man.
And it's been brought to our attention that you fit the description.
- I fit the description?
- That's right.
- Of the holdup man?
- Yep.
Well, it's crazy. That's crazy.
Sure. From what you say, this whole thing's a big mistake.
Why are you keeping me here?
Well, everything has to be done according with certain procedure, you see.
People bring accusations. All right, we have to look into the matter.
- See if there's anything to it.
- I'm completely innocent.
Well, we can't take anybody's word for that, you know.
We have to clear you before we can send you home.
- How do you clear me?
- Well, it's purely a routine matter.
But I'll tell you something.
It's nothing for an innocent man to worry about.
It's the fella that's done something wrong that has to worry.
- Well, there's one thing.
- Yes.
I've never been late at home without calling,
- and I'm always on time...
- That'll be taken care of.
Now, there's one thing we'd like you to do for us.
We'd like you to go and visit a couple of stores, if you don't mind that.
- Not if it'll help.
- It might.
It just might. Let's go.
What do you do at the Stork Club?
Play in the band. I'm a bass player.
I suppose you have some pretty high old times there.
- What do you mean?
- Oh, women, drinks,
- dancing, that sort of thing.
- I don't drink.
- Well, no?
- Of course, I don't dance at the club,
I just play in the band.
- Is this the one?
- Yeah, this is it.
- You familiar with this neighborhood?
- Yeah. I've been around here.
- Never been in this store?
- No. The liquor store? No.
Now, if you'll just walk into this liquor store, walk to the back of the store, turn around and come back here.
- In...
- Walk in, walk to the back of the store, turn around and come out again.
- Won't that look kind of funny?
- Not at all. You're just helping us out.
The fella in the store is expecting you.
I don't say anything?
Well, you can if you want to.
It isn't necessary.
- Was that all right?
- Get into the car.
- Lenny's?
- Yeah, that's right.
Your wife ever go to the Stork Club with you?
No.
No, we have two children, even if we didn't.
- Even if you didn't?
- Costs money.
What costs so much, admission?
No, there's no admission price, but the people who go there are well-to-do.
They wear expensive clothes.
Everything you order is expensive.
Oh, but you had lots of money at times.
No, I never have.
I'd like you to do the same thing again.
- In the store?
- Yeah, they're expecting you.
Just walk in. Same routine.
Wait a minute.
- Are you from the 110th Precinct?
- Yes, sir.
- Can I do anything for you?
- No, no. The police sent him over.
Oh.
Do you recognize him?
Well...
That's right, you weren't here Christmas Eve.
Well, I was here when the fella came in in November, though.
You want him to walk up and down again?
Well, yeah.
Would you do that again, walk back with your hat off?
Well?
Gee, I don't know.
Okay, you can go.
- Hey, what was...
- Did you get your change?
No. Say...
- I'll give you a ring.
- Right, sir.
Okay, next one.
Well, it's been over an hour since
I called you the last time, Mother, and he still hasn't come home.
There must have been some sort of an accident.
- Mother! Father!
- Be quiet!
Mother, come now!
Will you be quiet? I'm on the phone.
No, it's just the boys.
Yes, I called the hospitals, but they didn't have anybody answering his description.
Well, this is unlike Manny.
You know if he couldn't make it home for dinner, he'd call.
I wouldn't worry about Manny, Rose.
I used to worry sometimes, but that's just because he's so steady, you never expect him to be late.
Well, we wanna ask you, have you ever been in the offices of the Associated Life of New York in the Victor Moore Arcade building?
I was there this afternoon.
Why did you go there?
Well, I wanted to find out how much I could borrow on my wife's insurance policy.
She's gotta have a lot of work done on her teeth, and the dentist said it was gonna be about $300.
I wanted to find out how much I could borrow.
- Have you ever been in that office before?
- Yes.
Yes, we've got four policies there, my wife and I and the two boys.
We've each got one.
There was a strike some time ago.
The collectors were on strike, and I went into the office to pay the premiums during the strike.
- It was a long time ago.
- How long?
Oh, about a year.
And it's a year since you've been in the insurance office?
- I was there this afternoon.
- But before that it had been a year?
That's right.
And today, you went in to ask about a loan?
- Yeah.
- You need money, then?
Yes, I told you, for the dentist.
What do you make a week at the Stork Club?
- Eighty-five.
- That's the take-home pay?
- Yes.
- You play the horses?
Play?
Well, I have, but not very often.
How often?
- Three or four times.
- Not more?
- I don't think so.
- You go to the track regularly?
A friend of mine from the Stork Club goes on his day off,
- I've been a few times with him.
- You ever borrow any money?
- Yes, I have.
- When was the last time?
Last summer, I...
I borrowed $50 from the Homewood Finance Company
- when we were going on a vacation.
- Did you pay it back?
- Yes.
- Was it difficult to pay back?
I guess so. It's always hard to pay back.
How much do you owe?
- You mean right now?
- Yeah, now.
Oh, there's not much right now.
There's a few bills.
How much?
- Oh, $45.
- Maybe 100?
- No, it couldn't be that much.
- Less than 100?
It's less than 50, I'm sure.
Probably less than 40.
Maybe less than 30, I don't know.
- It's hard to say when I'm not...
- When you're not what?
Am I being accused of something?
Who says I'm a holdup man or look like one?
And what holdup are you talking about?
- Don't I have a right to know?
- Of course you have.
I'll tell you.
You've been identified by several witnesses as the man who held up the offices of the Associated Life of New York in the Victor Moore Arcade building.
You've been identified as the man who robbed them of $71 on December 18th, and $200 on July 9th last year.
Twice they say you were there.
The last time less than a month ago.
That's not true, is it?
- No, it isn't, I've never done anything...
- Have you been arrested before?
No, I haven't. Who says I did it?
You'll be confronted by the witnesses.
If you haven't done anything, you have nothing to fear.
Now, we wanna give you every break possible, Manny.
That's the way we do things here.
And there's one thing you can do for us that'll make it a lot easier for us and for you.
This fella who committed these holdups passed a printed note to the girl at the window.
I'll tell you what was in that holdup note.
And if you would print it out for us, it'll go a long way to show us if you're the same man.
Now, you say you're not that man.
I certainly am not.
Well, then you certainly won't print the way he does.
- Will you do it?
- Yes, I will.
Give him a paper and pencil.
I'll read the holdup note.
- Yes?
- Ready?
Yes.
An innocent man has nothing to fear. Remember that.
Oh, that's not the note.
I'm just telling you.
- Oh.
- This is the note.
"This is a gun I have pointing at you.
"Be quiet and you will not be hurt.
"Give me the money from the cash drawer."
Now, I wanna be entirely fair to you,
Manny, so I'll tell you right now that there's a rough similarity between your printing and the note.
That's right.
- Would you mind printing that again?
- No, sir.
I wanna give you every chance.
The note goes,
"This is a gun I have pointing at you.
"Be quiet and you will not be hurt.
"Give me the money from the cash drawer."
Hmm.
It's one of the most remarkable things I've ever seen.
Look at this.
This looks bad for you, Manny.
This really looks bad.
See that?
Well, Manny, I think you have a right to know, so I'll tell you.
I won't keep anything from you.
Here's three pieces of paper.
This is the note the holdup man gave the girl at the window.
And this other one is the first you printed at my dictation using the same words.
Now, there's a kind of similarity in the printing, of course, but that doesn't mean much.
Most people print alike when they use capitals.
But it was similar enough, so I asked you to print it again.
And when you did, well, something very strange happened.
Now, I put down the first copy of the note you made, and I show you the second.
Read it to me, Manny. Read it out loud.
Read exactly what's on the paper here, the second copy you made.
- This your printing?
- Yes, sir.
Read it.
"This is a gun I have pointing at you.
"Be quiet and you will not be hurt.
"Give me the money from the cash..."
You didn't read the last word.
I meant to write "drawer."
I guess I was in a hurry.
I left off the E-R.
And that's exactly how the holdup note read.
- How do you explain it?
- I made a mistake.
And so did the holdup man.
And it happens to be the same mistake.
Find out if the witnesses are here for identification.
Well, I'd better hang up.
He might be trying to call me now.
Okay. I will.
Goodbye.
Okay, Manny, come on.
Now, look carefully at the men in the other room.
I want you to count.
Please look at the men from right to left.
Count them off.
And when you come to the one you can identify, stop.
One, two, three, four.
- You're sure?
- Absolutely.
- Now, Mrs....
- Please, don't mention my name.
Very well, I won't.
Look carefully at the men you see in the other room.
Count them off from the right.
Observe them carefully.
When you come to the one you know, stop.
One, two, three, four.
You're positive?
Yes.
That will be all.
We won't keep you any longer tonight.
And thank you.
Manny?
Positive identification.
Here are the two notes.
Here's the original, and here's the copy.
Well, Manny?
- They call you Manny, don't they?
- Yes, sir.
- You made this copy of the note?
- Yes, sir.
- With a mistake in it?
- Yes, sir.
Now, the girls identified you.
They saw you in the office, and they saw you here.
There's no use beating around the bush, Manny.
You held up the office, you might as well say so.
But I didn't.
You were in that office this afternoon.
Yes, I went in to see if I could get a loan on my wife's policy.
You better think of another story, Manny.
Something more plausible.
But it's the truth.
You want to play it that way?
What can I...
Don't you see, I'm just trying to tell the truth?
Okay, Manny.
With the evidence before us, there's nothing to do but lock him up.
How can I tell you? What can I do?
If you can come up with something else, we'll listen.
Come on over here, Manny.
Throw your hat and coat on that chair.
Give me your right hand.
Relax.
Wipe your hands with this.
Come on, Manny.
Take your hat and coat.
We're booking this man for robbery, Lieutenant.

- Christopher Emanuel Balestrero.

All right, search him.
Put your coat on the rail, Manny.
Six dollars,
17 cents.
What else have you got?
It's my wife's life insurance policy.
Here's your receipt.
You can keep the rosary beads if you wish.
Come on, Manny.
- I never called my wife.
- That's been taken care of.
Give me your tie.
Yeah, well, naturally, we've been worried.
Yes, Officer.
My name is Conforti. C-O-N-F-O-R-T-I.
And I'm his brother-in-law.
Oh, I see.
Yes, sir.
Yes.
All right. Thank you.
Yeah, goodbye.
- Gene?
- Just a second.
I wanna make sure I get this right.
Manny was locked up for the holdup of the Associated Life of New York.
- Arrested?
- I knew it was something like that.
He was booked and locked up at the 110th Precinct station.
Can I see him?
No, not tonight. He's gonna be arraigned at felony court at 10:00 tomorrow morning.
- Then he has to spend the night in jail.
- Yeah.
That's what they told me.
- Where's felony court?
- Um, I don't know.
- We'll have to find out.
- But how could this happen to Manny?
Are you sure you heard it right, Gene?
I wrote down what the man said.
He said Manny was booked for a holdup?
Yeah.
- The Associated Life of...
- Yeah.
- You know, the office down in...
- I know what office it is.
- I can't imagine.
- They'll find out he isn't guilty.
Well, everybody knows he couldn't be guilty.
- How can a thing like that happen?
- Something sure went wrong.
Well, somebody's gotta tell them.
We'll go there tomorrow.
Tomorrow.
Everybody out.
Come on, let's go.
Hello, Manny. Come along.
Step aside.
Step over in front of the microphone.
Edward Ray, 97th East, 118th Street.
What about you?
Do you care to tell us about this?
- Ever been arrested before?
- Yep.
June 8, 1942.
Arrested for burglary by
Detective Bard, 8th Squad, sentenced to state's prison, Judge Fell,
County Court Manhattan, for five to 10 years.
- Still on parole?
- No.
- Step aside.
- This way, not that way.
Next case.
- Queens 1.
- Queens 1.
Step up this way, please.
Stand in front of the microphone.
Take your hat off.
Christopher Emanuel Balestrero.
Address, 4024, 78th Street,
Jackson Heights.
Assault and robbery.
Nothing on the yellow sheet.
- Ever been arrested before?
- No.
This man's being held for questioning by the District Attorney's office.
This man's being questioned by the District Attorney. Step aside.
- Next case.
- Step down.
This way.
Brooklyn 4.
Over here.
Stand in front of the microphone.
Take your hat off.
On a charge for grand larceny...
The defendant is discharged.
Felony court docket number 98,
Christopher Balestrero.
Officer, raise your right hand.
Do you swear to the truth of the affidavit you've signed?
- Yes.
- I'm appearing for the defendant.
- Did you file a notice of appearance?
- Yes, sir.
- You waive the reading of the complaint?
- Yes.
- How do you plead?
- Not guilty.
Judge, will you put this over to February 2nd for a hearing?
All right, February 2nd.
The defendant is held on $7,500 bail.
Could you set the bail in a lower amount, Judge?
He's never been arrested before, he's married, has a family and has a steady job.
Your Honor, this is an armed robbery.
And that would be a minimum amount of bail in a case of this type.
- Your request is denied, counselor.
- Put him downstairs, Officer.
Felony court docket number 98.
Sam Chulex.
Officer, raise your right hand.
Do you swear to the truth of the affidavit you've signed?
I guess I didn't know what happened.
You're being held over for the grand jury.
Bail's set at 7,500.
- Bail?
- Yeah.
- Will I be able to get out?
- If the bail's put up.
Yeah, but 7,500.
Who would see to it?
Well, you've got relatives, haven't you?
Won't they let me see my wife?
If she comes to Long Island City Jail.
Let's go, men.
Sizemore.
Sign your name here, then here.
Ward, sign your name here.
Up front.
All right, let's go.
All right, come on.
Each on felony.
These guys too.

Remove your hat.
Address?

- Age?
- Thirty-eight.
- Occupation?
- Musician.
- Born where?
- New York City.
Hold it there.
Balestrero.
Balestrero.
Balestrero.
Balestrero.
Okay, you've got bail.
Are you all right?
Who... Who raised the bail?
It was mostly Gene and Olga, darling.
Olga, I'll never forget this. Never.
You'll be okay now, boy.
- Darling.
- Oh, honey.
You'll never know how much I needed you.
- Manny, what is it?
- Oh...
- I feel...
- We'd better get him to the car.
Manny, we're going home now.
I've got some coffee and lasagna and...
- Manny, you'll be all right.
- I'm all right.
- Oh, you'll never know.
- I know, I know.
What is it, Manny?
I was remembering the police car sitting over there about a million years ago.
It's okay. You're home now.
- Daddy! Daddy!
- Hi, Dad!
- Dad!
- Hi, Daddy, hi!
We've all been waiting for you.
Could you eat just a bite of something hot?
What I want right now...
- Can I have it later, Mom?
- Of course.
- I gotta lie down for a while.
- Then that's what you should do.
Come in, Bob.
Mother tell you what happened to me?
No, she didn't.
I got arrested for something I didn't do.
You don't have to tell me.
I heard what they said on the phone.
Dad, you're the best dad in the world.
I do the best I can, Bob.
- Thanks for telling me.
- You're the best.
Hope you never have to go through anything like I did.
If you ever do, I hope you've got a son just like mine to come back to.
I never knew what my boys meant to me till right now.
Dad!
You ought to get some sleep now.
Yeah.
The lawyer in felony court said he'd recommend a Mr. O'Connor.
He said we should get in touch with him right away.
- What does Manny say?
- Well, I haven't talked to him about it.
He's too tired to even think about it now.
Did the lawyer tell you where we could find Mr. O'Connor?
Yes. He has an office nearby, in the Victor Moore Arcade.
Why don't you call him?
Mom, I wouldn't know what to say to him.
You'd have to think of what to say.
You always told me not to go out without my jacket, Mommy.
Why did you and Grandma go out in the yard?
Hello. I wonder if I could speak with Mr. O'Connor, please.
No. Mr. O'Connor has left the office and is not expected back this afternoon.
- Look, I know he'll see me.
- Is it urgent?
Well, I believe he intended to go straight home.
Oh, all right. Thank you.
We ought to get two music lessons today because we didn't get any yesterday.
He'll give us lessons as soon as he can, but not now.
Oh, hello. Is Mr. O'Connor in, please?
Oh, I wonder if you could...
Oh, yes. Is this Mrs. O'Connor?
Well, Mrs. O'Connor, I'm calling because we're in trouble.
And I was told that your husband could help.
No, no. I'd like to tell you, if I can just think where to begin.
My husband plays the bass fiddle at the Stork Club.
Oh, good afternoon. Mr. Balestrero?
Mrs. Balestrero?
This way, please.
Mr. and Mrs. Balestrero.
- All right. Hello.
- Hello.
- This is my husband.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- I'm Frank O'Connor.
- This is Mr. McKaba.
- How do you do?
Do sit down, won't you?
I'll see you later, then, Ray.
- All right, Frank.
- Please.
Since you called my wife, Mrs. Balestrero,
I've made some preliminary inquiries.
And the general outline of the facts seem to be as you stated them.
Well, everybody knows
Manny couldn't be guilty.
Everybody at the Stork Club knows he's not guilty anyway.
I spoke to Mr. Billingsley himself.
He said not to worry.
Well, then, you'll take the case?
Now, that's what we're here to decide.
Well, what is it you want, proof of Manny's innocence?
We've been married for nine years and we haven't been separated for more than two days at a time.
If Manny had done anything wrong,
I'd know about it, and I know he hasn't.
What I want first is Manny's own story, the full story about himself.
His life, his work and all the events after he went to the insurance office to raise money on your policy.
- Can you give me that?
- Yes, of course, Mr. O'Connor.
Good.
This will be an old story to you, of course, but it's all new to me, so take your time.
Mrs. Daily, I want you to take down
Mr. Balestrero's statement.
All right, then, Mr. Balestrero, let's start with some of your background.
Start with your full name and address.
Well, my name is
Christopher Emanuel Balestrero.
I live at 4024, 78th Street in Jackson Heights with my wife and my two boys.
Well, that does it for me, Mr. Balestrero.
- I'll take the case.
- Oh, Mr. O'Connor, how wonderful!
There is one difficulty, which it's only fair to mention.
I have little experience in criminal cases, and I shall be at a disadvantage with a skillful prosecutor.
We trust you, Mr. O'Connor, and you trust us.
We can't ask for more than that.
- It's the money problem that...
- Yeah. Well...
Let's not think about that.
Let's just concentrate on winning the case.
If we can do that, then the rest will take care of itself.
Now, um, I...
I want you two to go home and dig into your memories and into any records you may have and discover exactly where you were and what you were doing on these two key dates, the dates that the insurance company was held up.
We know where we were the first date.
We were vacationing at a hotel in the country.
Can you remember what you were doing that particular date?
- No, not offhand.
- No?
Mr. Ferraro might be able to help.
He's the owner of the hotel.
Well, why don't you both go out there and make a thorough checkup?
We might be able to use Gene's car.
We can't keep Mr. O'Connor any longer, Rose.
Yes. Goodbye. Thank you very much.
Goodbye.
- Thank you, Mr. O'Connor.
- Goodbye, Mr. Balestrero.
Of course. You were staying here those four days.
But there was so many guests,
I just couldn't swear to where anybody was on any one day.
The 9th of July, that's my birthday.
Yes, but you know where Manny was that day?
- No, I...
- I remember.
You had a birthday cake.
And you were going to have a party under the apple tree.
No. We had the party inside.
Because it rained. Now I remember.
It pour rain all day long.
- Not that it had...
- Was that that day it rained?
That was... It just rained one day while we were here.
We played cards that day because it rained so hard.
Four of us sat out here on the porch and played cards all day, right at that table.
You know, I probably knew their names then, but I can't remember one of them now.
First one I think of was a short fella with heavy eyebrows that grew out every which way.
- Oh, yes, um, a Mr...
- I don't remember him.
But we must have the names in the register.
And then there was a tall fella with a...
I remember he walked slowly and kind of stooped over.
And didn't he wear something like a wig?
- Yes! A little wig, right up in front.
- Yeah.
- That was Mr. Lamarca.
- Yes. That was him.
Lamarca, that's right.
He was here the first half of the summer.
And the third one was a tall fellow, used to be a boxer.
- You don't remember any of their names?
- No, I don't.
They write in this book.
We just look the wrong place.
Was the little man with the big eyebrows Mr. Molinelli?
- Yes, I think that was his name.
- Then here it is.
Here is his address, and Mr. Lamarca address too.
Is Mr. Lamarca in?
- Who?
- Lamarca.
Oh, they're the people that used to live here.
- You know where they moved?
- Well, Mr. Lamarca died, and Mrs. Lamarca,
I don't know where she is.
That was about three months ago.
We're looking for Mr. Molinelli.
- They're on the third floor, D.
- Oh, thanks.
Do you speak English?
What? What did she say?
Molinelli is dead.
There's our alibi.
It's perfect!
And complete!
They'll find the other man, the third one, you know, the boxer?
You remember him. And one's...
One's really enough.
It's my fault this happened to you.
It's these wisdom teeth.
I knew I shouldn't let you go down there, and yet I let you go right ahead.
It's just been an accident, Rose.
I let you go to the insurance company to borrow money for me, and then this fell on you.
We've been in debt before because
I haven't known how to handle things.
You had to borrow money from relatives and the loan company, and now we're going into debt to O'Connor all because I haven't known how to economize.
Truth is I've let you down, Manny.
I haven't been a good wife.
But that's nonsense.
You've been the best wife anybody ever had.
Rose, you're just talking nonsense.
You can imagine how we felt when we found out that Lamarca and Molinelli had both died.
You know, like somebody was stacking the cards against us.
But since it happened, it happened.
There was this other fella playing cards with us that afternoon, and Mr. Ferraro and his wife will help us find him.
And we'll find him, won't we, Rose?
Yeah, it was... It was bad luck.
But we can't let that shake us.
You'll just have to search your minds and find other witnesses.
Find that ex-prizefighter if possible.
And we'll be able to use the Ferraros as character witnesses, at least.
They promised they'd help us any way they could, you know, with the hotel register and whatever they could remember.
- Didn't they, Rose?
- Yes.
Of course, you realize it'll be the prosecutor's job to break down your alibi if that can be done.
He'll have those identification witnesses in court, and they'll swear you're the holdup man.
I think maybe you'll have to go back to Cornwall, and dig up some more facts on your side.
Now, um, this second date, December 18th.
Uh, did either of you recall any event or circumstance that might be useful to us?
- December 18th?
- I remember I didn't go out much before Christmas. I had a toothache, and my jaw was so swollen, I didn't feel like working, looking that way, you know.
I did work at the club, but otherwise I didn't leave the house.
Was that noticeable?
Oh, yes, the fellas in the band kidded me about it all the time.
How long did it last?
It was two weeks before Christmas.
- See a dentist?
- Yeah, several times.
Uh-huh, and he'd testify to that?
And if you'd held up the insurance office
December 18th, this swollen face would be noticed.
- Sure would.
- Yeah.
But this was not mentioned by any of the girls who identified you.
Yeah, I think we may be able to make something of this.
And, of course,
Rose could testify to that too.
Yes.
I suppose so.
Hmm. Yeah, I...
This swollen jaw of yours is something for me to work on.
Um, have you got the name of the dentist?
I have it someplace.
I'll phone you when I get home.
I'm going to bring in a handwriting expert because your printing and the printing on the holdup note will have to be compared and proved to differ.
Well, now, I want you two to think again about Cornwall when you get home.
Try and get the name of that boxer.
Try and recall any other details.
See you again day after tomorrow, right?
- Yes, sir.
- Okay.
Rose?
Goodbye, Mrs. Balestrero.
We're gonna win this case, you know.
Goodbye.
Is this usual?
No. I don't understand it.
I think you should let a doctor see her, Manny.
I think I will.
You mean right away?
Oh, I don't know. I'm no doctor, but I'd say she's a very sick woman.
Rose, it's almost morning.
Haven't you gone to bed yet?
No.
Honey, it's chilly in here.
You should have been asleep a long time ago.
I can't sleep.
Rose, this is the second night
I've come home and found you awake.
And you're not eating either.
Honey, this isn't right.
Don't you think you ought to see a doctor?
There's nothing wrong with me.
Why should I see a doctor?
Well, when a person doesn't sleep and doesn't eat and seems to lose interest in everything, maybe a doctor can think of something.
We can't pay for things now.
How could we pay for a doctor?
I've been thinking about the trial, and who will stay with the boys while we're away.
I called Mother, and she'll come over and stay.
If you want her to.
Rose.
The last few days, you've...
You haven't seemed to care what happens to me at the trial.
Don't you see?
It doesn't do any good to care.
No matter what you do, they've got it fixed so that it goes against you.
No matter how innocent you are or how hard you try, they'll find you guilty.
We're not going to play into their hands anymore.
You're not going out.
You're not going to the club and the boys aren't going to school.
I've thought it all over, sitting here.
We're going to lock the doors and stay in the house.
We'll lock them out and keep them out.
Yes, maybe that's the thing to do.
We won't go out any more than we have to, but there's one thing we should arrange, whether Mother comes here or the boys go and stay with her.
You wanna get the children out of the house because you think I'm crazy, don't you?
Don't you?
Well, you're not so perfect either.
How do I know you're not crazy?
You don't tell me everything you do.
How do I know you're not guilty?
You could be.
- You could be!
- Rose.
Rose.
You went to the loan company to borrow money for a vacation.
You did that when we couldn't afford it.
You always wanted to buy things on time.
I told you not to.
I told you they'd pile up and pile up until we couldn't meet it all.
- Rose.
- And it did pile up.
And then they reached in from the outside and they put this last thing on us.
And it'll beat us, and you can't win!
They spoiled your alibi.
They'll fix it so that they can smash us, and they will.
They'll smash us down!
It's true, Manny.
There is something wrong with me.
You'll have to let them put me somewhere.
What makes you think so?
People had faith in me, and, well, I... I let them down.
But it wasn't always that way, was it?
No, I guess not.
When did you first feel this way?
When my husband was arrested.
That's when I knew I'd let him down.
Well, how did you know it then?
I could tell.
They wanted to show me up.
Were they thinking about Manny or about you?
No, they wanted to punish me because
I'd failed him and then let him down.
I did everything all wrong.
Well, didn't they arrest him because they thought he was guilty?
Oh, no. No, they knew he wasn't guilty.
I was guilty. They were after me.
They were after me and they'll get me.
It's no good trying. It's useless.
What is it that's useless,
Mrs. Balestrero?
Well, everything.
They come at me from all sides.
And it's no good.
They know I'm guilty.
What's wrong with Rose, Doctor?
Is it her mind?
Yes, it is, Mr. Balestrero.
How serious is it?
Well, at the moment, her mind is in an eclipse.
She doesn't see anything as it is, and she blames herself for everything that has happened to you.
But she wasn't to blame for any of it.
Of course not, but she thinks she was.
And she believes this so strongly that it darkens the whole world for her.
She sees great, lurking dangers everywhere, and she thinks she's brought them on you.
Now, there's a well-known pattern to what she's going through.
She's buried under some kind of landslide of fear and guilt.
What can we do, then?
The best thing would be to place her in a controlled environment where she can receive medical care.
You mean an institution?
It must be chosen carefully, and must give her a tranquil surrounding.
And the kind of assistance she needs to find her way out of this maze of terror she's in.
She couldn't be at home with us?
Not if you think of her, and of giving her a chance to get well.
I just can't believe that Rose...
I can't let her go.
She's living in another world from ours, a frightening landscape that could be on the dark side of the moon.
And I'm not there?
You're there, and the children are there, but not the way you are.
Monstrous shadows that say hateful things.
Now, she knows she's in a nightmare, but it doesn't help her to know.
She can't get out.
Is it incurable?
No case is incurable.
I want her to have the best there is.
The best for her.
Here's your bag, honey.
Come on, honey.
- Mr. Balestrero?
- Yes.
This is my wife.
I think it best if you say goodbye here, Mr. Balestrero.
Goodbye, Rose.
Goodbye.
Would you come with us, please?
Rose?
Christopher Balestrero, please rise.
These persons are called here today as jurors to try you on indictment charging you with the crimes of robbery in the second degree, two counts, grand larceny in the second degree, three counts and assault in the second degree, two counts.
As they come to be sworn, and before they are sworn, you may be heard.
Be seated, please.
Also, ladies and gentlemen, we'll hear from another young lady who works for the insurance office by the name of Constance Willis.
She will positively identify him for you, ladies and gentlemen, as being the same man who was in that insurance office on the date that the robberies occurred.
You'll further hear from Alice Dennerly, another young lady who works for the insurance office, who will testify substantially to the same as Miss Willis.
And you will hear from the detectives who arrested this defendant.
And this defendant admitted to the detectives that he was in financial difficulties, that he had to borrow money not to go to the racetrack to bet, but he had to borrow money to pay off the bookies in New York.
He was in trouble with the bookies.
He had to pay them off.
And what he borrowed, ladies and gentlemen, may not have been enough.
This, substantially, is what the people's witnesses will testify to.
They will positively identify this defendant as being the man who committed the robberies.
And I'm sure, ladies and gentlemen, when you have heard and seen the people's witnesses, you will only be able to bring back one verdict, and that will be "guilty as charged."
Thank you.
May it please the court,
Mr. Foreman, ladies and gentlemen of the jury.
You have heard in considerable detail the indictment in this case.
As the District Attorney has told you, an indictment is only an accusation.
I would much prefer that the proof in this case come entirely from the lips of the witnesses that we will bring into the court during the trial, because in the last analysis, what I say to you now or hereafter, or what Mr. Tomasini has said or may say to you later on, is of little or no significance in the case.
You must decide the case upon the testimony from the lips of the witnesses as they appear before you.
A defendant, under the American system of justice is obliged to prove nothing.
He can sit here mute and say not a word.
And the burden of proof lies upon the people.
We are, however, going to bring into the court during the course of this trial a series of substantial, reputable citizens.
And I invite you to scrutinize them closely, and to determine, in the light of their testimony, the guilt or innocence of Christopher Emanuel Balestrero.
Because from the lips of these witnesses, it will be established to your complete satisfaction that this defendant who stands here today accused of these crimes did not, in fact, commit any one of them.
I'm going to ask you to consider the probabilities of this case.
And I'm going to ask you that when the proof is all in, to see if you don't say to yourself that this is a tragic case of a mistaken identity.
Because on July the 9th, 1952...
Was that the entire extent of the conversation you had with this man?
As far as I can remember, yes.
He said, "Don't call anyone or ring any bells."
And I gave him the money.
- You gave him $200?
- Yes.
What did he do then?
- He left the office.
- And what did you do?
I went in to the district manager and told him about it.
Mrs. James, would you look around this courtroom and tell us if you see the man who was in your office on July the 9th in this courtroom?
Yes, I do.
Would you step down and point him out to us?
Right there.
Will you step down and put your hand on his shoulder?
Let the record show that the witness stepped down and walked to a place alongside the defendant and put her hand on his shoulder.
And did something else happen after you gave him the money?
Yes. Ann was asked to go to her...
- By Ann, you mean Mrs. Ann James?
- Yes, sir.
Mrs. James went to her cash drawer, also gave him cash from...
Before Mrs. James went to her cash drawer, did you hear this man say something,
Mrs. James?
Yes. After I gave him the cash from my drawer, he told her to get the cash from her drawer.
And did she get some cash from her drawer?
Yes, she did.
- Did she give it to this man?
- Yes.
Do you see this man in this courtroom?
Yes, sir.
Will you step down and put your hand on his shoulder?
- That isn't necessary.
- Will you point him out to us?
Which man is it?
The gentleman standing there with the red tie.
- Standing?
- Sitting there.
How is he dressed?
Navy-blue suit, a red tie and white shirt.
Now, Miss Willis, is it not a fact that they had a lineup at the 110th Precinct?
That's right.
And how many men were in the lineup?
Six, I'd say, seven men.
And Christopher Emanuel Balestrero was one of them?
That's right.
What did he wear?
He wore a coat and a hat, I believe.
Were there any men in that alleged lineup that you knew before that night?
I'll object to the words "alleged lineup."
Whatever you wanna call it.
No, I will allow it.
That's his choice of words.
How many of the men did you know?
One.
- Who is that?
- Mrs. James's husband.
What did Mrs. James's husband have on that night?
A brown overcoat and a brown hat.
Now, Miss Willis, will you please tell the jury how this thing worked?
I mean, what were you told to do with regard to picking the defendant out of the lineup?
We were told to count, and then tell them what number he was.
What number did Mr. Balestrero have?
If you remember.
If you don't, just say so.
- No, I'm afraid I don't recall.
- Do you recall what number Mr. James had?
No, he moved around too much.
Did the number one man have an overcoat on?
As far as I can remember, they were all dressed the same.
Did he have an overcoat or not, the number one man?
She said as far as she knows, they were all dressed alike.
Well, this...
Can you remember how tall he was, approximately, the number one man?
If you know. If you do not know, say so.
- No, I don't know.
- Approximately
- how much did he weigh?
- If you know, say so.
- If you do not, say so.
- No, I do not know.
Your Honor, do we have to sit here and listen to this?
The court will rule on what is proper evidence, Mr. Juror.
The court is a sober judge of what is proper evidence.
When the case is submitted to you, you will be the sole judges of the facts.
Your Honor, may counsel approach the bench?
Yes, certainly.
If Your Honor pleases, in view of all the circumstances connected with the incident that has just occurred, at this time, I move for a mistrial.
Your motion is granted.
Foreman and ladies and gentlemen of the jury, it's the right of defense counsel to make the motion for a mistrial, which the court has just granted.
We had to ask for a mistrial.
There was nothing else to do.
What does that mean, Mr. O'Connor?
It means we have to go through the whole thing again.
- Everything?
- Everything.
Wait for days on the calendar, choose another jury, examine the witnesses.
Can't we just go ahead?
Not after what that juror said, no.
We have to start all over.
Oh... We've just as good a case as we had before, though.
Nothing's lost.
We just have to face up to it all over again.
Can you take it, Manny?
I'll try, Mr. O'Connor. Thanks.
I think I could have stood it better if they'd found me guilty.
It's like being put through a meat grinder.
Once isn't enough.
They've gotta do it to you again.
I brought it all on myself, though.
I've been such an idiot.
You'd all be better off without me.
None of it is your fault, Manny.
You've just had a lot of bad breaks that can happen to anybody.
Yeah, what can I do?
Have you prayed?
Yes.
What did you pray for?
I prayed for help.
Pray for strength, Manny.
I don't see how anything can help if I don't get some luck.
Somebody committed those holdups.
Where is he?
Maybe in jail already for some other crime, in some other state. Maybe we'll...
He'll never be suspected for anything he committed in our neighborhood.
My son, I beg you to pray.
I gotta go to work.
A pound of ham, please.
What's that?
This is a gun.
Give me the money from the cash drawer.
What money?
Temper, lady, temper.
That won't do you any good.
Don't you come near me.
Keep back!
I never did this before!
Let me go. I've got kids!
I didn't hurt anybody. Let me go!
- Police?
- I didn't hurt anybody.
We have a guy here.
Tried to hold up the store.
Yeah. We can hold him.
One for the detectives, Lieutenant.
Straight ahead.
Manny, they want you over at the 110th Precinct.
What is it?
They got the right man.
Everything's going to be all right.
Manny.
Well, I guess it won't be long now.
What is it, Mr. O'Connor?
Where'd they find him?
They got him. They got him.
Now, you, Miss Willis.
Start counting from the right.
When you come to the man you know, stop on the number.
- Are you ready?
- Yes.
Okay, go ahead.
One, two, three, four.
Are you sure that's the one?
Yes.
That's all. Thank you.
Okay, Manny?
Okay.
I can't wait to...
This way.
You realize what you've done to my wife?
Wait here for me.
Rose.
Honey, it's all over.
They caught the man who committed the holdups. It's all over, darling.
It's Manny, Rose. He's come to see you.
I know.
Would you tell her the good news again?
Yes, of course.
There's no more trial, Rose.
They know I'm not guilty.
They caught the man who did it.
They know I'm innocent.
We can start our lives all over again.
We can start someplace else if you'd like it better.
We have some wonderful friends, Rose.
They've stood by us right through everything.
Mr. O'Connor, the Stork Club, the people up at Cornwall.
Don't look away from me, Rose.
All right.
Rose, honey, I love you.
This awful nightmare we've been through, it's all over now.
That's fine for you.
- Fine.
- For you too, Rose.
It's not good for me if it isn't good for you.
Doesn't it help you?
No.
Is there something I've done, Rose?
Is there something you can't forgive me?
No, nothing you've done.
Can I help you, Rose?
Nothing can help me.
No one.
You can go now.
Don't you wanna come with me?
It doesn't...
It doesn't matter where I am.
Where anybody is.
What will I do with my life, honey?
There's nothing left without you.
The boys pray every night that you'll come home.
We need you.
Your husband's going now, Mrs. Balestrero.
Couldn't you speak to him?
He brought you good news.
That's fine for you.
You can go now.
But come back.
I guess I was hoping for a miracle.
They happen. But it takes time.
Rose?
She's not listening now.
English - SDH
Between North and South America
lie the islands of the Caribbean, colorful and exotic.
Once remote and little known,
history is forcing them out of obscurity into the current of world events.
Important among these islands is the British colony Trinidad.
I'm looking for Inspector Smythe.
- He's down there, sir.
- Thank you.
- Inspector Smythe?
- Smythe here.
Good evening, Inspector.
I'm Anderson, from the American Consulate.
Oh, yes, Mr. Anderson.
You're a new arrival here.
- Welcome to Trinidad.
- Thank you.
I've been meaning to call on you,
- but I've been so busy getting settled.
- Yes, of course.
I thought your Consulate would want to be informed.
The young man's an American.
Neal Emery. Artist chap.
Accident?
- No. Suicide, apparently. Shot himself.
- Good heavens.
Now, let's have your light, will you?
- When did it happen?
- We're not sure yet.
Those two fishermen found him adrift in his boat a few hours ago.
All right, boys, you can go now.
Thank you very much.
Is there anything I can do?
Well, we've got to break the news to his wife.
- She's also an American.
- Oh.
You can carry on.
I'll join you at headquarters.
Get the medical report through as quickly as possible.
- Yes, sir.
- Well, shall we go now?
Yes, of course.
Poor girl. It seems awful to have to wake her up in the middle of the night to tell her this.
Don't let it disturb you, Mr. Anderson.
This hour of the night, the poor girl is usually wide awake.
- To the Caribe.
- The Caribe?
- You mean she'd go to a place like that?
- She works there.
Inspector, once again you honor the Caribe with your presence.
An unavoidable coincidence, I assure you.
- We came to see Mrs. Emery.
- Of course. Everybody does.
You're just in time. I give you a good table.
We're not here to be entertained.
We want to talk to her.
Alone.
A chick a chick boom chick boom
A chick a chick boom chick boom
Announces you're in the room with the Trinidad Lady
A chick a chick boom chick boom
A chick a chick boom chick boom
Your ticker goes boom boom boom for the Trinidad Lady
It's only that I do what I love
And love what I do
Can't help the mad desire
That's deep inside of you
You realize the fault isn't mine
That you are to blame
You want what you can't have
And you're all the same
A chick a chick boom chick boom
A chick a chick boom chick boom
It's dangerous to presume with the Trinidad Lady
So chalk up one more escapade you never had
The one you dreamed of with the Lady from Trinidad
It's only that I do what I love
And love what I do
Can't help the mad desire
That's deep inside of you
You realize the fault isn't mine
That you are to blame
You want what you can't have
And you're all the same
A chick a chick boom chick boom
A chick a chick boom chick boom
A chick a chick boom chick boom is the Trinidad Lady
Why would a man kill himself when he had...
Good evening.
- I...
- I know all about it.
You're lonely, it's wonderful to meet an American girl, and couldn't I have a drink with you after the show?
Well, the answer's no.
If you're lonely, go home to your wife.
This American girl has to make a change.
- Oh, but you don't understand. I...
- Oh, but I do.
- Outside.
- Hello.
Mr. Anderson of the American Consulate.
- Am I being deported or something?
- No.
We'd just like to have a chat with you.
Well, I don't exactly have time for an international conference,
- so make it brief.
- When did you last see your husband?
This morning at breakfast. Why?
Did you talk to him?
Sure.
I asked him to pass me the salt.
Did he tell you where he was going today?
- I didn't know he was going anyplace.
- Well, he did, and it's rather important that we know where.
I'll think about it. Drop by tomorrow.
I suggest you think about it now.
- 'Cause if you're trying to protect him...
- Protect him from what?
Well, whatever it is, there's no longer any point.
He's dead.
How?
Suicide.
No.
I'm terribly sorry, Mrs. Emery.
I'm afraid, if you don't mind, I...
Did you hear everything quite clearly,
Mr. Wittol?
Believe me, Inspector,
I was only trying to help.
I said to myself, "Chris is in trouble.
Maybe I can do something."
Yes, we all know what a great heart you have.
I'll have to ask you to come down to headquarters to answer a few questions and make identification.
We'll wait outside.
- Yes, sir?
- Get me the medical examiner, please.
Hello?
- Hello, Doc?
- Yes.
- This is Smythe here.
- Yes.
Have you got anything for me on the Emery case?
- I haven't had time yet.
- Oh.
Well, get to it as quickly as possible, please.
- Has the identification been made?
- Yes. His wife's in there now.
As soon as she leaves...
- Shall I wait?
- I'll call you back.
Yes. Thanks.
Sit down, won't you?
Cigarette?
Thank you.
That's not an easy ordeal for anyone.
Funny, isn't it?
When a person dies, you only remember the good things.
Mrs. Emery, do you know of any reason why your husband should have killed himself?
He'd been very unhappy for a long time.
Was there any trouble between you?
There was nothing between us.
We lived in the same house for the past year, but that's all.
- Did he have any particular setback lately?
- No.
No. Lately he acted as if things were going better for him.
Oh? What things?
He didn't tell me.
There were lots of things he didn't tell me.
Could they have been something to do with Mr. Fabian?
- Max Fabian?
- Yes.
I believe he and your husband were closely associated.
But Mr. Fabian's a wealthy man.
What business could he have with Neal?
He was a friend of his, that's all.
Your husband bought you a rather expensive gift about a month ago.
How could he afford it, doing sketches for $1 each at the Caribe?
He couldn't. I made him take it back.
Nevertheless, he had the money to pay for it.
- Do you know where he got it?
- He sold a painting.
To Max Fabian, of course.
- Is that illegal?
- No, but it is illogical.
I mean, Mr. Fabian paying your husband
$1,000 for a painting.
He happened to like his work.
He's bought paintings from him before.
Doesn't $1,000 seem rather high for the work of an unknown artist?
All right.
If the money was for something else, tell me.
I'd like to know, too.
I was hoping you'd tell me.
After all, you and Mr. Fabian are very friendly.
He comes to the café frequently to see you.
Lots of people come to see me.
That's what I'm paid for.
But you don't sit at the table with them, nor become quite so intimate.
You are quite intimate with Mr. Fabian, aren't you?
I think I've had enough of this. Mind if I go?
- Inspector, I don't think...
- Very well.
There'll be an inquest in a couple of days.
That'll be all for now.
By the way,
I wouldn't try to leave the island if I were you.
The planes and the boats will be told to watch for you.
Don't forget the sharks. I might try to swim.
Mrs. Emery.
I'll be right back.
Mrs. Emery.
Mrs. Emery, I'm sure the Inspector didn't mean to imply...
Those were bricks falling, Mr. Anderson, not innuendoes.
Well, if there's any way the Consulate can help...
No, thank you.
All I want to do is get out of here fast, catch the first boat back home.
Are there any friends or relatives you'd like us to notify?
Well, there's...
No.
I guess not.
They tell me Trinidad makes the rest of the tropics look like Callahan's back yard.
- Yes. It's very beautiful.
- Must be.
I have a kid brother who came down here five years ago to paint a tropical moon.
He's still painting it.
Say, maybe you know him.
The name's Neal Emery.
- Emery?
- Yeah.
He's about my size. He's a sort of a...
No. I don't recognize the name.
- You down here on business?
- Yes, business.
- Come down here often?
- Yes. No.
- Once in a great while.
- Things must be picking up.
I hadn't heard from him for months, and then all of a sudden I...
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.
- Anything wrong?
- I don't know.
But I hope he makes it.
I say, Jimmy, why waste your time with that?
Here comes the real thing.
May I have one more, Mrs. Emery?
How about giving a fellow American a break,
Mrs. Emery?
My name's Peters. Freelance reporter.
I'd like to get some details on this story.
You know, American girl, ex-GI.
- With pictures of me doing native dances?
- Why not?
- We could both pick up a few bucks.
- Not interested.
Listen, baby, you don't have to put on an act with me.
I've been in that joint you work in.
I'm an old friend of Mrs. Emery's.
If she needs an arm to lean on,
I think she'd prefer mine.
Sure. Sure, whatever you say, Mr. Fabian.
- There'll be no more of that. I'll see to it.
- Thank you, Max.
Why haven't you let me come to see you?
Why should I bother you with my troubles?
I was a friend of Neal's.
I'm still a friend of yours.
At least, I hope I am.
Oh, Mrs. Emery?
Inspector Smythe would like to see you, if you please.
Of course.
- Excuse me, will you, Max?
- I'll wait for you.
Oh, I'll be with you in a minute.
Very well. Now, sign there, will you, please?
Oh, Mrs. Emery, this is Jefreemy Bates, a fisherman from the island of Tobago.
He has some information for us.
Thank you. That'll be all for now.
- We'll let you know if we want you to testify.
- Yes, sir.
Do you happen to have your passport with you?
- Yes.
- May I have it, please?
Mr. Anderson tells me you're planning to return to the States.
As soon as this is over.
Well, I can't say I blame you.
Your stay in Trinidad hasn't been a happy one.
However, I'm afraid I can't let you go.
Not just yet.
Perhaps not for a very long time.
Mr. Anderson, I...
Mrs. Emery, your husband didn't commit suicide.
- He was murdered.
- Murdered?
Yes.
According to the medical examiner, there were signs of a struggle.
He died of a fractured skull, not a bullet wound.
The gun was fired after death.
But who would want to kill Neal?
I have here a statement made by the man who just left.
I'd like you to hear it.
"I, Jefreemy Bates, do declare that at 4:30 in the afternoon of Monday last,
"I saw Neal Emery's boat docked at the landing
"which adjoins the estate of Max Fabian.
"There was no one on board.
"I was in view of the landing for at least half an hour
"and during that time saw no one approach or leave the boat."
4:30 in the afternoon, approximately the time at which your husband was murdered.
You think Mr. Fabian...
Or someone in his employ.
But I can't believe it.
He was a friend of Neal's.
Mrs. Emery, if you knew Max Fabian's history, you'd have no trouble whatever in believing it.
- But what reason could he have?
- As for his precise reasons, I'm not sure, but we're certain your husband was involved with him, and murder is very much a part of Mr. Fabian's business.
He's caused the death of many thousands.
Oh, he's not a criminal in the ordinary sense. Far from it.
He's a man who deals in political intrigue, secret information, treason.
A man who has grown rich by exploiting trouble and unrest wherever they exist.
During the last war, he recruited saboteurs for the enemy.
He bought and sold vital military information for both sides.
However, there's no need to go on.
The important fact is that Max Fabian is now in the Caribbean and, frankly, we're disturbed.
We have reason to believe that he's engaged in activities that threaten our security.
Well, then, why don't you arrest him?
Unfortunately, we have no proof.
We can, however, arrest him for the murder of your husband and charge that you were the motive, that he killed Neal because he was in love with you and wanted to get rid of him.
It would be difficult to convict him, but at least we can try.
I realize it would be a very ugly business for you, and I regret to have to put you through it, however, I have no choice.
I hate to think what tomorrow's paper will look like.
By the time this is over,
I won't be able to go back home.
There is an alternative, Mrs. Emery.
Yes, there is.
And we'd much prefer it if you could help us find out exactly what Mr. Fabian is doing in Trinidad.
Me?
How could I...
It's well known that he finds you most attractive.
You could get us the proof we need.
Is this where Neal Emery lives?
Well, would you tell him that his brother's here?
Come in.
I Wittol, sir.
- You are the owner of the Caribe?
- Yes. Full owner.
- You knew the deceased, Neal Emery?
- Very well. An unhappy, tragic boy.
- He was in your employ, was he not?
- We had arrangement, that's all.
I allowed him to use my premises for his sketching.
- Purely out of friendship.
- Inspector?
You were good friends, then, eh?
To give you an idea, I let him run up a bill at the bar, almost $100.
Little secret from his wife.
Can you give me any reason why Mr. Emery should have taken his life?
When a man wants so much to be a great painter and has failed...
You mean he was despondent about his work?
Many things.
To understand Mr. Emery, you must remember he was an American.
It humiliated him to be supported by his wife.
It's a ridiculous attitude, of course.
Why should he object to such an arrangement?
Myself, when I was young,
I used to dream of such a thing.
Now, of course, it's too late.
That's all. Thank you, Mr. Wittol.
You may step down.
- Thank you.
- Mrs. Emery, please?
Mrs. Emery, we have no wish to add to your grief, and we shall try to conclude this hearing as rapidly as possible.
You have heard Mr. Wittol and the others describe your husband's state of mind.
Do you agree substantially with what has been said?
- Yes.
- Do you have anything to add?
No.
In your presence, did your husband ever speak of suicide?
Yes, many times.
- Inspector Smythe?
- No questions, sir.
That'll be all, Mrs. Emery.
- We have no further evidence to present, sir.
- Very well, then.
Since there is nothing to conflict with the presumption of suicide, this inquest rules that the deceased died by his own hand.
This hearing is adjourned.
Look this way, Mr. Fabian.
Flowers?
- Thank you.
- Buy some flowers.
No.
Chris, the worst tortures are those we invent for ourselves.
You feel guilty about Neal?
- Oh, I suppose so.
- Don't. It was not your fault.
You were very good to him.
He said as much to me, many times.
- Thank you, Max.
- You must forget what's happened.
Your life is ahead of you now.
You deserve some happiness.
I want you to make me a promise.
I want you to promise that you'll let me help you.
I will, Max, only...
Well, right now, I don't know what I want to do, where I want to go. I...
I just feel numb and tired.
Would you like to come in?
Everything thrives in the tropics, including gossip.
It might be better if I didn't.
You're a good friend, Max.
But in a few days, perhaps you could come to the house for dinner.
- I'd like to.
- Shall we say Sunday?
Sunday.
Goodbye. And thank you.
You're Steve. Dominique told me.
And I know who you are.
I read about you in the paper.
What happened to him?
Can't we talk about it later?
We'll talk about it now.
Well, there were so many things.
- Not enough success...
- I heard all that at the inquest.
I wanna know what really happened.
What's the matter, you think I'm down here by accident?
Neal wrote and asked me to come down here.
I got a letter in my pocket not five days old.
- A letter?
- Yeah.
Why would he ask me to come down here and then kill himself?
But I...
Well, you remember what he was like.
- Temperamental, moody...
- He was moody for 30 years.
Now, will you stop giving me a lot of double talk?
I want some answers that make sense.
- Look, I know you've had a shock...
- Yeah, but not you.
No, you walked out of that inquest like you were on your way to a cocktail party.
Just a minute.
What makes you think you can rush in here and talk to me like this?
What do you know about me?
I just have to look at you to know what happened.
I can see how Neal fell for a dame like you, and I know the kind of time you gave him.
It's too bad I got here a few days too late.
A few days?
You got here three years too late.
If you loved your brother so much, why didn't you ever try to find out what was happening to him?
No, you couldn't do that!
But you walk in here and take your guilty conscience out on me.
Well, I won't listen to it.
I've had all I can stand of you and your brother and all of you!
Since you have hurt her, you think you will feel better.
You were distressed because you did not find her mourning in a black dress.
- Widows have been known to wear them.
- Not in the tropics, Mr. Emery.
Only Spanish women wear the black mourning here.
Well...
It is not appropriate that you should leave now.
You have said too many bad things.
I think you will want to apologize later.
Yeah, well, maybe you're right.
Maybe I did talk out of turn.
I don't know.
There are many things you do not know.
I will bring you a drink in the patio.
It is cooler there.
And you'll stay for dinner.
Why have you not eaten?
- We weren't hungry.
- No one can live on grief.
Yesterday is yesterday.
Tomorrow is tomorrow.
- You left out today.
- Today is already yesterday.
- Chris, I hate to keep apologizing, but...
- It isn't necessary.
It was the letter that threw me.
I still don't understand it.
He sounded so happy, so cheerful.
When I walked into that inquest...
I'll take it.
- Yes?
- Mrs. Emery, this is Inspector Smythe.
I have here the arrival list from the customs office.
There's a Steve Emery.
Could that by chance be your husband's brother?
Yes, it is.
You haven't discussed anything with him concerning your husband's death?
No, of course I haven't.
Good. Is he with you now?
- Yes.
- Then I'll be brief.
Tell him nothing. He must be kept out of this. Do you understand?
Well, I'm not sure that I do.
Well, we can't afford to take any chances.
There's too much at stake.
If you'll just do as I ask.
And remember, we're counting on you.
I understand.
Goodbye.
The club where I work.
They want to know when I'm coming back.
How long do you think you'll be here, Steve?
Thanks.
Well, Neal said something about a job down here, so I figured to stay for some time.
- But now...
- May I see that?
Sure.
Why would he ask me to come down here if he didn't want me to know what was going on?
- What do you do, Steve?
- I'm a flyer.
I can't imagine what he had in mind.
- He didn't say anything to you about it?
- No, he didn't.
Didn't even mention
I was coming down here?
Maybe he wanted to surprise me.
He was like a little boy that way.
Yeah. Poor guy.
I did everything I could for him, Steve.
- Sure.
- I want you to believe that.
Well, look, it's getting late.
You've had a rough day.
- Where are you going?
- I don't know.
To find myself a room somewhere.
Oh.
Well, I suppose you could stay here if you wanted to.
No, thanks.
I wouldn't want to put you to any trouble.
It's no trouble.
You could use Neal's room.
Neal's room?
Yes. It's right over here.
I'm sure Dominique won't mind turning down another bed for a few days.
Well, Dominique seems to have anticipated us.
She's got some kind of mental radar.
She knows what you're thinking before you do.
Does it seem all right?
Yes. This is fine.
Thanks.
- Chris?
- Yes?
- Good night.
- Good night, Steve.
- Say, Chris?
- Yes?
What about you?
What are you gonna do now?
- Go back to my job.
- Why?
Well, a girl has to live.
Well, there's other jobs, other places.
Is there anything else keeping you down here?
Not especially.
Who was the fellow that brought you home today?
Just a friend of Neal's.
Oh.
You know, I was thinking, if there's nothing to keep you down here, maybe we can take the same boat home, huh?
That would be nice, Steve, but I've sort of gotten used to the tropics.
Don't you ever get homesick?
I mean, three years is a long time.
I know.
I remember coming home after the war.
I flew a bomber in from San Francisco.
I remember when we passed over Chicago, my copilot had all he could do to keep me from setting that plane right down in the middle of Michigan Boulevard.
Yeah, boy, I had it real bad.
Hey, don't you ever get a yen for a place like that?
Oh, say, an old theatre that you used to play in, maybe a park where you went ice skating?
Think it over.
The States might be just the thing for you.
Anyhow, if you ever do decide to come back, look me up, huh?
You know, you picked up a spare relative today.
Thank you, Steve. I'll remember that.
Say, Chris, when did it happen?
- When did what happen?
- Neal.
What was the date?
The 22nd.
Why?
Nothing, nothing. I...
I was just wondering, that's all.
- Is Mr. Wittol in?
- Yeah. He's in the office.
- You have an appointment?
- In this joint? You kidding?
What's your business?
It's all right.
Mr. Wittol has no secrets from me.
He's been holding out on you.
It's all right. Don't bother to get up.
Yes?
This ought to cover the bill.
Don't make any more jokes.
What jokes? What bill? Who are you?
You remember a bill my brother ran up at your bar?
Or wasn't there any bill?
You? His brother?
Of course, of course, of course.
This is such a pleasure to meet you,
Mr. Emery.
Of course, under circumstances, an unhappy pleasure.
Tell me, when did you arrive?
What you doing in Trinidad?
- You have business here?
- I'll ask the questions.
- What happened that day?
- That day? Oh, oh.
Nothing. Just a day like any other day. Why?
You buried him too deep at that inquest.
Look, Mr. Emery, with me there is no necessity to shoot in the dark.
If I knew something, I'd tell you.
What was the job he had for me down here?
Job? What job?
Your brother had a job for someone?
He was trying to make an impression.
Believe me.
- You're lying.
- Wait.
- Where are you going?
- To the police.
No. Please, wait. Don't.
All right. I see you are too intelligent to accept a half-truth.
It's a matter of gallantry.
Besides, for me she's a valuable investment.
- You talking about his wife?
- So you've met her?
- That makes it difficult.
- Makes what difficult?
You have seen her quiet, dignified, soft and demure.
But if you had seen her as I have, night after night, dancing,
- stirring men's blood...
- Look, will you cut out the poetry?
Please, Mr. Emery, you must realize she is not just a woman, some woman, she's Woman with capital "W."
How could any man feel that he possessed her completely?
Is such a thing possible?
You mean she was playing around?
You see, you are already imagining and you are angry.
American attitude.
Never trust a beautiful woman. Typical.
- Was she or wasn't she?
- Oh, I...
- Who was the guy?
- Guy? What guy?
There was no guy.
This is what I'm trying to tell you.
When a man is married to a goddess, he must expect other men to worship her.
This killed him. This fact he couldn't accept.
What I told you now is the truth. Believe me.
Hello. May I speak to Mr. Fabian, please?
- Where did he go?
- Out.
- Well, didn't he say where?
- No, just out.
Do you like him?
- Well, he seems very nice.
- Well, I like him.
That's good.
This one is a man.
The other was a shadow of him.
- Well, I hadn't thought much about it.
- Maybe it is appropriate that you should.
I shock you, perhaps?
When one day is over, another day begins.
- West Indian proverb?
- West Indian household hint.
- Good morning.
- Morning.
- Where've you been?
- Oh, I was taking a walk.
- How do you feel this morning?
- Better, thanks.
- Fine. Fine.
- Where did you walk to?
Oh, here and there.
Well, it isn't a secret, is it?
No, it's no secret at all.
As a matter of fact,
I hired a car for a few days.
I thought I'd let you show me the island.
I thought you were leaving right away.
Well, I changed my mind.
See, I figured if I stayed around for a while, it would give us a chance to get better acquainted.
- You don't seem very pleased about it.
- Well, of course I am.
Well, fine.
You wanna get started, make a day of it?
Well, I'm not much in the mood for sightseeing, Steve. I...
It will be good for you.
And you'll need these.
Do I take a liberty?
It is the prerogative of a good and loyal servant to be impertinent.
I wouldn't fight with her if I were you.
She's got radar, remember?
Hello!
You having fun?
- Thanks, Steve.
- What for?
For helping me to remember how.
- What's that all about?
- Oh, I was just thinking.
I've had three wonderful days.
I'm glad you decided to stay and get acquainted.
So am I.
Thanks.
Dominique, you've got two starving people on your hands.
- Have you anything to eat?
- Hello, Chris.
Max.
I couldn't deny myself the pleasure of seeing you any longer.
- Well, I...
- I hope you don't mind my dropping in.
Oh, no, of course not.
I'm just surprised to see you, that's all.
Well, good.
For a moment I thought it was dismay.
You're Neal's brother.
- Yeah, that's right.
- I'd heard you were in Trinidad.
Well.
- Chris, aren't you going to introduce us?
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- This is Mr. Fabian, Steve, a friend of Neal's.
- How do you do, Mr. Emery?
- Hi.
- I'm very glad you're here.
You know, the last time I saw Chris,
I was quite worried about her.
She seemed so terribly shaken up.
But now, I don't think
I've ever seen her looking more radiant.
You're to be complimented.
Oh, Chris, perhaps Mr. Emery could join us for dinner tonight.
Oh, but didn't you get my message, Max?
Message? No.
Yes. I left word I couldn't make it.
- Well, you see, with Steve here, I thought...
- Well, bring him along by all means.
I'd like him to see my house.
Oh, did Chris tell you that I own several of Neal's paintings?
No. She hasn't said much about you.
Well, I don't know whether to feel hurt or flattered.
But you will come, won't you?
Yeah.
- Yeah, I'd like to.
- Good. It's settled, then.
My car will pick you up at 6:00.
I'll let myself out.
Looks like he wants somebody to eat.
Oh, good evening.
Good evening.
Won't you go into the living room?
Mr. Fabian will be down in a moment.
Thank you.
Well, I didn't know you and Neal had such rich friends.
You're quite right, Mr. Emery.
I do have a lot of money.
But I...
Well, I hope it won't be a barrier between us.
Why should it be?
I have no objection to money.
- Chris, my dear.
- Hello, Max.
- How beautiful you are tonight.
- Thank you.
I think you look lovelier in this color than any other.
Don't you agree, Mr. Emery?
Well, there are a few shades that I haven't seen her in yet.
You have a treat in store.
I mixed the cocktails myself this evening.
- You'll have the usual, won't you, Chris?
- Yes, I will.
- And you, Mr. Emery, what would you like?
- Oh, I'll have some of the usual, too.
Hans.
How are you finding Trinidad?
Very nice place to relax, except that I came down here to work.
Hey, maybe you can help me.
You know, my brother wrote about a job, but nobody around here seems to know anything about it.
Didn't he mention it to you?
No, I don't believe he ever did, but then, I hadn't seen Neal for quite a few weeks before...
Chris?
Thank you.
You going to be with us much longer,
Mr. Emery?
Oh, I haven't quite made up my mind.
To your stay, then, however long.
May it be a pleasant one.
Gets more fascinating every minute.
Chris, I brought my chef across half a dozen borders.
If that dessert goes back untouched, he may start re-crossing them.
Why, it's delicious, Max, but I've eaten so much tonight.
It seems to me you've eaten very little.
And you, Mr. Emery,
I'm afraid my chef hasn't made much of an impression on you, either.
Oh, I'm impressed, all right.
With everything.
Especially with this coat of arms.
Has that been in your family a long time?
I have no family.
But all my friends said I deserved one, so I invented that crest. Why?
Nothing.
I just have a feeling
I've seen it somewhere before.
Well, shall we have our brandy on the terrace?
Excuse me.
Rotten, corrupted, decadent!
Why, it is intolerable that we should be forced to deal with you.
No, it's you who are intolerable.
Intolerably stupid, dull, overbearing...
Veronica, please.
Mr. Walters, I must ask you to refrain from addressing my wife in such a manner.
Oh, I address your wife as she deserves.
Drunk in every cheap bar in Havana.
- She's no better than a...
- My dear, please.
- Oh, shut up.
- Why make a scene?
- You dare? You dare to slap my face?
- Slap your face?
- I ought to claw your eyes out.
- Veronica, Walters.
Be quiet, all of you.
There are other people in the house.
- Really?
- What people?
Should we have come earlier, Max, or later?
You're not supposed to return till tomorrow.
- Why have you come back tonight?
- Because I insisted on it.
- I told them, Max. I told them we shouldn't.
- Never mind now, Franz.
Since you are here,
I suggest you come in and meet my friends.
And try to appear normal.
I'm afraid it sounded like a native uprising, but it was only my houseguests returning from a long journey.
- This is Mrs. Huebling. Mrs. Emery.
- Oh, how do you do, Mrs. Emery?
- And her brother-in-law.
- I heard so much about you.
I hope we're not too late for the floor show.
When does it go on?
Well, it seems to be on right now.
Why, Max, she's witty as well.
How nice for you.
I must apologize for Veronica.
She has a tendency to be rude when she's tired.
I'm not tired. I'm slightly drunk.
Oh, hello.
Max didn't tell me anything about you.
- Veronica, my dear.
- Oh, stop picking at me like a sparrow.
What a wonderful world.
At 7:00 this evening, we're all hating each other in Jamaica, and now, only three hours later, we're loathing each other in Trinidad.
Thank you, Max.
Veronica, some people are mellowed by drink.
- I suggest you have another.
- Thank you, darling. I will.
But I'm not promising to pass out.
Oh!
- Thank you.
- Veronica.
Excuse me.
- This is my good friend Peter Bronec.
- How do you do?
Mr. Emery, Mr. Bronec.
- Yes, we came down on the plane together.
- Oh?
Feeling better, Mr. Bronec?
Yes, yes, of course.
You didn't tell me you were ill, Peter.
I was not ill, Max.
- It is just sometimes on the plane that I...
- You're stammering again.
- No, I'm not. I...
- Quite badly.
Let's hope this little vacation will cure that.
If you'll excuse me,
I have some letters to write.
- This is Mr. Walters.
- How do you do?
And Dr. Huebling.
How do you do, Mr. Emery?
- Dr. Franz Huebling?
- Yes.
Didn't you write some articles on the V-2 rocket just after the war?
Oh, I used to dabble.
Just a few little experiments.
All outdated now, like the spinning wheel.
- You are interested in such matters?
- Yeah, I used to dabble a bit myself, flying a B-29.
Franz, you must all be hungry.
Why don't you tell the chef to fix you something?
Yes, Max, of course.
And you, Mr. Walters, you can join us later if you're not too tired.
We'll be on the terrace.
Shall we go?
Don't be so greedy, Max.
You can show Mrs. Emery the moonlight, but I'm keeping Mr. Emery here with me.
You don't mind, do you?
I'm sure they don't.
Besides, you wouldn't want me to drink by myself, would you?
I've been cooped up in Max's plane for three hours with three very dull men.
But you're not dull.
Oh. You are dull.
Any man who can't keep his eyes off another woman is dull.
Might have known you'd be in love with her.
Oh, yes.
You're in love with her, and so is Max, and who knows how many others?
What is it about her?
Is it that dance she does?
Maybe I ought to learn to dance.
And let me see. What is it she does?
A chick a chick boom chick boom
A chick a chick boom chick boom
A chick a chick boom chick boom
Chris, there are so many things
I've wanted to say to you.
When Neal was alive, I couldn't. But now...
Surely you must know how I feel.
No, Max, I don't.
I thought the symptoms were rather obvious.
The young man inside recognized them.
- Steve?
- Yes. And he didn't like them.
He's jealous. But I can't blame him.
I'm jealous, too.
Oh, but you shouldn't be.
Chris, I'll be leaving Trinidad as soon as my affairs here are settled,
- and I was hoping that...
- Affairs?
I thought you were a man of leisure.
I could be, if it would please you.
Well, why should you rearrange your life for me?
I want to, for both of us.
We could do anything you like, go wherever you like.
Paris, Cairo, Seville...
Oh, it sounds wonderful, Max, but, well, how can I decide so quickly?
There's so little I know about you.
You know that I couldn't stay away from the Caribe while you were there, that I came every night for months because of you.
- And you must know that...
- I suddenly feel cold.
Funny, isn't it, on a night like this?
No, wait here. I'll get your scarf.
I want to finish this conversation.
I told him nothing on the plane.
Nothing, I swear it.
- Why get upset?
- None of you believe me.
- Of course we believe you.
- Why must I stay?
I have done everything I promised.
My work is almost finished.
- Could you complete it this evening?
- Yes.
I'll work all night if I have to.
Then you can leave in the morning.
Thank you. Thank you, Max.
Max!
You must get your friends out of this house immediately.
Why? Has some new calamity arisen?
We had to carry Mrs. Huebling upstairs, and your friend Mr. Emery is with her.
That woman is not responsible.
She might say anything in her drunken babbling.
I'll be up in a moment.
Meantime, even at the risk of dislocating your personality, try to be calm.
Chris?
I'm sorry I kept you waiting, but we seem to be having some sort of domestic crisis.
Mrs. Huebling is in quite a state, for some reason or other.
Oh.
Well, perhaps it would be better if Steve and I left.
Yes, perhaps it would. I'm terribly sorry.
- There'll be other evenings.
- I hope so.
As a matter of fact,
I'm giving a birthday party next Thursday.
Your being here would give me something to celebrate.
- Will you come?
- I'd love to.
Good.
You shouldn't have left, Mr. Walters.
She had some very interesting things to say about you.
She's a very sick woman, very sick.
Did you two use up all the moonlight?
We're leaving, Steve.
Leaving? Why?
I thought you were having such a good time.
Well, I'm tired and it's rather late.
I'm sorry this was not a more successful evening, Mr. Emery.
Well, I know how hard you tried.
Better luck next time.
Mr. Emery.
Good night, sir.
- Good night, Doctor.
- And thank you very much.
Anytime.
This whole situation is becoming impossible.
I'm in the midst of a nightmare.
A nightmare!
Where else could we meet?
And your wife!
Can't you control this woman?
You don't understand her.
I understand her only too well.
Now perhaps you can explain to me why you returned tonight.
Because I found out your man was captured trying to get into the United States.
Now how do you intend to proceed?
My government is tired of all these endless delays.
If your government isn't satisfied, it can go elsewhere.
But we pay you tremendous sums of money.
- You made an investment.
- And we don't intend to lose it.
What possessed you to bring those people into the house?
The young man is already suspicious.
He recognized Huebling.
He saw Bronec gibbering like an idiot.
Bronec leaves tomorrow.
His work is finished.
He's in no condition to leave.
The man is on the verge of a mental breakdown.
I said his work is finished.
As for his condition, that will be corrected.
- And Mr. Emery is my concern.
- Very well.
But I warn you, if anything goes wrong, you will be held responsible.
Remember that.
Walked out again.
I believe it's a national characteristic.
Coming up to see me, Max?
I'm feeling much better, thank you.
Could I have a nightcap?
What did you say in front of that young man?
Nothing, Max. Nothing.
How do you know, since you were practically unconscious?
I was there, Max, every minute.
- You took care of everything in Jamaica?
- Yes, everything.
I bought the land in my name, just as you said.
You told them you were an impoverished noblewoman?
- Yes.
- And that you were looking for a piece of land on which to settle down quietly with your sick husband?
- Yes, Max. That's what you told me to say.
- And you think they believed you?
Of course they believed me. Ask Franz.
Why shouldn't they?
Because impoverished noblewomen don't go about wearing strings of pearls worth $50,000.
- My pearls!
- I told you to leave them here.
Please, Max. Veronica, leave them.
I'll get them for you.
And don't look to me for help when your visa expires.
I'm through with you and your drunkenness.
- Max, you can't.
- You go to the guesthouse and help Bronec.
He must finish his work tonight, you understand?
Yes, Max.
Well?
Oh, Max, please.
Good night, sir.
Okay, you can tell your boss.
We didn't even hold hands.
I think we could have gotten along without that last remark, don't you?
Well, I wouldn't want Mr. Fabian to spend a sleepless night.
All right, Steve, you've been saving it up for hours.
Say it.
No. I'm waiting to hear how you'd say it.
- You're a trusting soul, aren't you?
- Not any more. Not after tonight.
Why didn't you tell me you had a date with Fabian?
I meant to, but I forgot.
You forgot a lot of things.
You forgot to tell me he was a friend of yours as well as Neal's, that he bought Neal's paintings.
Did you also forget to tell me he bought Neal's wife?
The rain woke me.
Get you up, too?
Yes, the rain.
I'm leaving tomorrow.
Leaving?
Yeah.
You won't have to put up with any more of my insults.
Steve, the things you believe about me,
- they're not true.
- Forget it.
You don't have to account to me for anything.
But I want to.
Then why didn't you tell me about the crest, about Fabian, about everything?
What is it between you and him?
There's nothing between us.
Is that why he looks at you the way he does?
Like he can't wait to get his arms around you?
I can't help how he looks at me.
But his arms have never been around me.
Nobody's arms.
Not for a long time.
Not even Neal's?
Not even Neal's.
Well, weren't you in love with him?
I was once, but love is something that has to be kept alive, and it wasn't.
Oh, Chris.
Oh, Steve, Steve.
Every time he looked at you tonight,
I could have... If anybody looked at you...
Oh, Chris.
Come back to the States with me.
But I can't now, Steve.
- Why not?
- Don't ask me. I just can't.
What's wrong, Chris?
Nothing. Nothing, but...
I'll come to you later, if you want me to, as soon as I can.
What is this, another of those phony stalls
I've been getting since I come down here?
Oh, you know it isn't.
How do I know?
Steve.
Very interesting. Very.
But what exactly do you expect me to do about this?
I expect you to do your job.
Look at the date on that letter.
That was written on the day my brother died, on Fabian's stationery.
And he said he hadn't seen him for weeks.
Look, what's the matter? You guys have to have a bomb go off under you before you do anything?
Mr. Emery, there has been a thorough investigation of all the facts.
What facts?
You mean the ones at the inquest?
Back home, they ask more questions when a dog's run over.
Why don't you go up and look around Fabian's house?
The place is crawling with phony characters.
And that job my brother wrote about, how do you know that wasn't for Fabian?
He has a private plane.
Mr. Emery, you have a decided flair for the dramatic.
Twenty or thirty wealthy residents have private planes.
You can't arrest people for being phony.
As for this stationery, your brother could have got it from Fabian's house at any time, not necessarily on the day of his death.
You've got an alibi for everything, haven't you?
Well, maybe you can alibi the way
Fabian acts around my brother's wife.
Frankly, I consider that an item for the gossip columns, not for Her Majesty's police.
What's the matter?
Fabian got you in his pocket, too?
I must caution you, Mr. Emery, that libel is a very serious matter.
So is murder.
I think you'd be wise to go home and leave this to the authorities.
You'd like that, wouldn't you?
Yeah, too many of you guys want me to go home.
Give me that. I'll keep that, if you don't mind. I wouldn't want it to disappear.
- I certainly wish we could tell him.
- So do I. But I have my orders.
Until he's cleared, we can tell him nothing.
Don't worry, Mr. Anderson.
We're checking on him.
We should be hearing very soon.
At the moment, I'm much more concerned with Mr. Fabian's houseguests.
- Yes, sir?
- Get me Mrs. Emery.
And that's the man who was working in the guesthouse.
Bronec. Peter Bronec.
Bronec. Bronec. Yes, here he is.
Peter Bronec, electronics and radar specialist.
Quite a brilliant one.
Huebling and Bronec.
What can Fabian want with those two?
If you could only get into that guesthouse.
But how?
Well, perhaps the night of the birthday party.
There'll be quite a lot of people milling about, and you might...
But I couldn't possibly get in.
It would be locked.
- Yes?
- Bronec's leaving. Pan-American, 11:00 A.M.
- Oh, he is? Good.
- We've got it confirmed.
Bronec's leaving on the 11:00 plane.
We'll have to hurry.
I want to have a talk with him.
He seems to be in quite a state.
Perhaps I shall be able to get something out of him.
But what about Steve? Mr. Emery?
I've got to tell him something.
Call me this afternoon.
I may have some word for you by then.
I know, but I'm worried.
He may get into trouble.
Just be patient, Mrs. Emery, for a little while longer.
Yes, yes. And thank you.
You've done very well.
Very well indeed.
- Morning, Baker.
- Morning, Inspector.
- Has a Mr. Bronec come through yet?
- Bronec?
- No, but he has a reservation.
- Yes, I know. Thank you.
He ought to be along soon if he intends to catch that plane.
There's Fabian's car now.
That's him.
Get after that car, quickly.
What are you staring at? Get an ambulance.
I'll get it, Dominique.
- Hello?
- Mrs. Emery?
Yes.
Mr. Bronec is dead.
What?
Yes. He was run over by a car at the airport about half an hour ago.
It's obvious he was murdered.
Of course,
Mr. Fabian was shocked and horrified to hear what had happened to his guest.
But this time, I think he's been a little hasty.
I have great hopes of tracing the car.
My men are on it now.
Oh, by the way, I found something among Mr. Bronec's effects which I think may be of use, a set of keys.
I think you may be able to get into that guesthouse after all.
Well, I'll try.
Good. Well, I'll get the keys to you at once.
Incidentally, is Mr. Emery there?
Well, no, he isn't.
He left the house early this morning, and I haven't heard from him since.
Well, we can tell him what the situation is now, but I think you'd better let me do it.
Ask him to come in and see me, will you?
- Yes, I will.
- Thank you.
Bye.
You are mixed up in something bad.
What is it?
Nothing, nothing.
Since when you keep your life a secret from me?
Oh, Dominique, please! Let me alone.
But you must know more about it.
You found his body on the boat.
Where was he going? Where had he been?
Somebody must know.
- You say you're his brother?
- I told you three times I'm his brother.
Now, if you know something, why can't you tell me?
If you could find Jefreemy Bates, maybe he...
- Jefreemy Bates? Who's he?
- Please, you will not say who told you.
No, I won't say anything if you don't want me to.
Who's he? What does he know about it?
He's a fisherman from the island of Tobago.
After your brother was found, he went to the police station.
He was there a long time.
Then later he'd say nothing.
But if you told him you were his brother...
How do you get to this island?
The dock master may know someone who will take you there, sir.
Thank you.
Not him. It is the chauffeur.
Mr. Fabian's chauffeur.
Why should Mr. Emery go away for three days and not tell you?
Oh, I suppose he had his reasons.
You do not want to go to Mr. Fabian's house tonight, do you?
Then why do you go?
Let me send the car away.
It's too late, Dominique.
If he does come back tonight, tell him that I...
Never mind.
- You look stunning this evening, my dear.
- Thank you.
What a lovely handkerchief.
Is this what you were shopping for yesterday, Max?
What a quaint idea, giving Mrs. Emery a gift on your birthday.
Shouldn't she have brought you something?
She brought herself.
I want to see Mrs. Emery.
I'm sorry, sir, but I don't think
Mr. Fabian is expecting you.
There's a lot of things
Mr. Fabian isn't expecting.
You can't come in here.
Excuse me.
Good evening, Mr. Emery.
To what do we owe this intrusion?
It belongs to a friend of yours.
Give it back to him.
Maybe there's somebody else he wants to stab in the back.
What's the matter with you? Are you crazy?
And I have a few things to say to you, but not here. Get Mrs. Emery's wrap.
This is my house, Mr. Emery.
If there's anything you want,
I suggest you address yourself to me.
I'll get to you later.
Well, are you coming or not?
I'm not ready to leave.
All right, then, you'll hear what I have to say now, both of you.
I have a statement here signed by a fisherman by the name of Jefreemy Bates, a statement that says my brother was in this house on the day he died.
Have you got an alibi for that?
- Do you mind?
- Yes, I mind.
I'm tired of listening to stories about how my brother committed suicide.
I'm using this to light a fire under you and the police.
Oh, Max, he's been drinking.
He doesn't know what he's saying.
He's got all kinds of crazy ideas about Neal's death.
Let me talk to him alone, please.
Let's not have a scene.
All right, but I'll be nearby.
Oh, Steve, you've got to get out of here.
I'll explain everything later, but you must leave now.
Why? Give you and him a chance to figure a way out of this?
Oh, no, no.
You knew Neal was here on the day he died, didn't you?
But I can't talk about it now.
Don't you understand?
I understand you've been lying to me ever since I got here.
All right.
If you want the truth, you can have it.
Sure, I knew he was here that day, because I was here, too, with Max.
That's why he killed himself, because he found out about Max and me.
Now, will you get out?
Well, what do you want, another signed statement?
I'll give you one to take home and frame.
Thank you.
This party's turning into a wake.
Let's have some entertainment. Excuse me.
Ladies and gentlemen, the Trinidad Lady!
Fasten your safety belts!
I've been kissed before
Arms have held me fast
You can tell by my kiss
You weren't the first
And you won't be the last
With heart and soul I kiss them
And file the memory under M
Tomorrow, if I miss them
That may be the only time I think about them
I've been kissed before
Only fools tell when
I was born to be kissed
To kiss and be kissed
And I'll be kissed again
A heart is broken nightly
A smile that they misunderstood
Unless you treat it lightly
You'd better be going
While the going is good
Many loves have I
You were just one more
But someday I'll be kissed
And maybe I'll doubt
That I've been kissed before
That I've been loved before
On that day that I'm kissed
I'll even deny
That I've been kissed before
Oh, many loves have I
You were just one more
But someday I'll be kissed
And maybe I'll doubt
That I've been kissed before
That I've been loved before
On that day that I'm kissed
I'll even deny
That I've been kissed before
That was my birthday present to you, Max.
I hope you liked it.
I couldn't think of a more exciting way to begin a new year.
Are you still here?
What are you waiting for?
Max, don't.
Let him go.
I'm sick of seeing him around.
You don't know what sick is.
Happy birthday, sucker.
What did you say to him before?
I told him he was making a fool of himself.
Well, I shouldn't think that would produce such startling results.
I also told him I was going away with you.
He's so jealous, he can't see straight.
Max, I don't want to go back to that house tonight.
Could I stay here?
Of course.
I'll tell the housekeeper to prepare a room for you.
Here you are, darling.
Welcome to our city.
What has happened?
Why did she not come back with you?
Why should she? She belongs where she is.
Max, most important.
Will you excuse me, please, Chris?
It's incredible, Max, incredible.
Well, is it what we have been waiting for?
I must check these figures at once. Come.
Mr. Fabian, will you want me to take off again tonight?
I'll let you know.
Olaf, see that he gets something to eat.
Yes, sir.
It will only take me a few minutes.
Well, Mr. Walters, you may be able to leave very soon now.
Good, good. Good.
Why do you leave these papers lying about in the open?
Don't be alarmed.
They're meaningless to anybody but Franz.
His own mathematical shorthand.
Never have I seen matters conducted as they are here. Never.
- Well, Franz?
- It's correct, Max, correct.
And so clear, so simple.
You see, the principle of the power center is what...
I'm not interested in details.
How soon can we start production?
At once, if your government has the technical resources.
- And is it all we have been led to believe?
- More.
I will explain it so that even you can understand it.
The German V-2, of which we were so proud, was a kindergarten toy compared to this.
With launching bases in the Caribbean, there is not a vital area in the United States that is not within striking distance.
Let me show you.
Here.
Chicago, San Francisco, Los Alamos,
Oak Ridge, New York.
Excellent, excellent.
In case of war, your country could strike a blow that would make Pearl Harbor seem like a slap on the wrist, and using America's own weapon, if the irony interests you.
Yes, yes.
Well, Mr. Walters, have I earned my money?
Max, remember, it was I who urged my government to make this deal with you.
- Yes?
- It's Veronica.
The entertainment's over, Max, and your guests are leaving.
Unless you can persuade Mrs. Emery to do another number for us,
I suggest you come and say good night.
Is there anything else, Franz?
No. You go along, Max.
I'll stay and do a little work.
- Coming, Mr. Walters?
- Yes, yes.
Good night. Thank you.
Good night.
Veronica, do you know where Mrs. Emery is?
No. Am I supposed to?
Chris.
I was wondering where you'd disappeared to.
Oh, I was just getting some fresh air.
Well, what's become of my little gift?
Oh, well, I...
Oh, well, I must have lost it someplace.
- Oh, I'm terribly sorry, Max. I...
- Don't be upset.
One of the servants will find it before morning.
Come. I'll show you to your room.
- Max?
- Yes?
I was just thinking, I really should go home.
But why this sudden change of heart?
Oh, nothing. It's just that...
Well, I won't have anything to wear tomorrow, and I...
Oh, is that all? I'm sure Veronica will lend you whatever you need.
Of course. I have some lovely things
Max gave me that I've never even worn.
- But I...
- I won't hear of your leaving now. Come.
I suppose she could have decided to stay the night.
Take a look at that, will you?
All right, you can bring Mr. Wittol back in.
This is ridiculous, Inspector, ridiculous.
Why should we spend the whole night here?
Look at your friend, how tired he is.
Inspector, I tell you, I didn't even know this man Bronec existed.
Why should I kill him?
Inspector, do you think it's my psychology to run a man down with an automobile?
The world is filled with such fascinating methods of destruction.
Why should I commit such a clumsy murder?
Yes, it is clumsy, but it's also very bold, and you're neither.
That's why I'm sure somebody was behind you in this. Who was it?
Please. I am not a man for alliances.
Yet you admitted that the car that ran over Bronec was yours.
It was stolen. My driver had his day off.
He left the key in the car.
Personally, I can't even drive.
Why didn't you report the theft?
- Because the car was returned.
- How convenient.
Why didn't you report the fact that there was blood on the mudguards when it was returned?
Blood?
I... Well, I didn't know it.
I told the boy to wash the car, but...
Who looks for blood?
No, Mr. Wittol.
It was not your driver's day off, because you don't give him a day off.
And you were both seen driving towards the airport shortly before the murder.
That's not true.
You are trying to confuse me.
- Yes?
- Chauffeur has given us a full confession.
Thank you.
Well, Mr. Wittol, you can stop being confused, because your driver doesn't seem to be as inventive as you are.
For the last five minutes, he's been able to think of nothing but the truth.
Now, are you prepared to make a statement, Mr. Wittol?
Yes. Yes, sir. I tell you everything.
But you must remember that
I am just a pawn. I'm a weak man.
I am very easily dominated.
Is everything all right, Doctor?
Why, yes, Olaf. Excellent, in fact.
Why?
I thought I heard something.
No.
Well, good night, sir.
Good night, Olaf.
I wouldn't do that if I were you.
I have some bad news for you, Max.
I'd like to break it to you gently, but I simply don't know how.
What bad news?
Franz found this.
The poor darling thought it was mine.
So?
But do you know where he found it?
In the guesthouse.
Really, Max, to be taken in like a schoolboy.
Is this what you're looking for?
Yes?
It is past 3:00 and still she is not here.
Well, maybe she decided to spend the night.
Why should that keep you up?
She's done it before, hasn't she?
That is your anger speaking again.
You are leaving? Why?
You really don't know what's been going on, do you?
Please speak straight, Mr. Emery.
What is it I do not know?
I'm talking about her and Max Fabian.
- This is a lie.
- Oh, is it?
Well, she told me so herself.
Even so, she lied.
For what reason I do not know.
Mr. Emery, you think two women could live in the same house and such a thing be kept a secret?
I tell you, there is some terrible trouble here.
She did not want to go to Mr. Fabian's house tonight.
She is afraid of something, not only for herself, but for you.
You must not turn away from her now.
Is that true? You are planning to take Mrs. Emery with us?
There's room on the plane, and I thought it would lend something to our trip.
Ridiculous. Hasn't your stupid infatuation given us enough trouble?
If you disapprove of the traveling arrangements, you can stay here.
Don't worry, Mr. Walters.
Max will know how to dispose of her.
He has a real flair for that sort of thing.
As soon as Franz is ready, we'll leave with Mrs. Emery.
Ask Olaf to bring her down.
Excuse me, Mr. Fabian. Will that be all, sir?
- Yes. We'll be out in a few minutes.
- Yes, sir.
- See what that is.
- Yes, sir.
I think I'll have one for the road.
It's all right, Count.
Well, can we go now?
It's dangerous to wait any longer.
Max, there isn't any real chance of our being caught, is there?
I mean, it would sort of take the fun out of everything.
Well, Chris, our little journey may not be as gay as the one we planned, but I promise you it won't be dull.
Relax, Mr. Fabian.
Steve.
You're not going anywhere.
Oh, Steve! Steve, I...
It's all right. You can tell me about it later.
You're a very determined intruder, Mr. Emery.
That's right. Come on, let's get out of here.
Don't rush off.
There's something I'd like to ask you before you leave, if you don't mind.
Have you also enlisted as a British agent?
What, didn't you know?
Mrs. Emery has been deceiving both of us with a third party.
Her Majesty's police, no less.
What government do you represent?
Or are you here simply in the role of a private citizen?
Steve! Steve!
- We must get out of here at once.
- Just a moment.
Max. Max, you're hurt!
We'll have to delay our departure.
Olaf, take her upstairs. Lock her in my room.
Veronica, some brandy. Franz, quickly.
Max, I...
I don't think there's any point in your waiting, after all.
Max! Franz, there must be something we...
No.
It would be wiser if you all left at once.
What do we do with him?
You don't want us to leave him here.
Take him along.
I don't want him in this house.
His presence here offends me.
Olaf, I'm remaining here.
You'll see to it that Mr. Emery leaves with you.
Yes, sir.
As for Mrs. Emery,
I myself will make the necessary arrangements concerning her.
Under the circumstances,
I think it only fitting.
Olaf.
Take him out.
If you're waiting for my last words, you've heard them.
Come on. We can't wait here any longer.
- Max, we can't leave you this way.
- Veronica, please.
Taking a last look at Trinidad?
You know, you're gonna find Chicago kind of cold after the tropics.
Am I?
One more glass...?
Pour it up. I've drunk stronger men than you under the table.
- Germans can't take much.
- I've partied with all nationalities.
And more than that?
- So we're heading in to me?
- I don't think so.
- Why not?
- I don't have time for that reward.
- So, how have you been?
- Why, fine.
- You haven't changed, Dagmar.
- I can't say the same.
Play something cheerful. A samba.
Can you dance samba, Willy?
- Let go. Someone could come.
- Not at this hour.
Can't you hear that people are still awake?
- The good life. Just like that dancing salon.
- Yeah.. they have someplace to go.
- You only have one thing on your mind.
- No. This isn't natural.
You live at home.
Your mother can't stand me.
Sure she can. See for yourself how easy it is to find a crib.
I've started up four chains and all of them have failed.
- Things will work out.
- Yeah, when I get my basic pension.
- But what matters is that I love you.
- I just wish I could appreciate it more.
Kiss me, Kalle.
- Let go. Someone's coming.
- Dammit!
- She was in a hurry.
- She seemed strange, no?
And then that goddamn light.
- Let it go.
- What?
What you were thinking about.
He's not worth it.
- There's no he.
- There always is.
A man who's seen as much as I have won't be fooled so easily.
- Can I interest you in a sketch?
- No thanks.
It's really nice. Sunset over the castle. Only 10 crowns.
Signed by the artist.
See how beautiful it is.
Here. Keep the sketch.
Olavsgatan 13, 5th floor, Brink.
We'll be there.
Nobody may enter, or touch anything.
- The ambulance is here.
- Just pick her up.
It's not normal for women to commit suicide like this...?
Sleeping pills and gas are the regular ways. But she wanted to be sure.
Yes, and it went faster, I reckon.
She's in there.
Svensson. Does a writer named
Wikner live here?
- Just across the hall.
- Here's the death certificate.
Take the keys and bring them to the station.
Inspector Lövgren.
May I come in?
Please.
Anders, can you come out?
A man wants to speak with you.
- I don't have time. Tell him to get lost.
- He's from the police.
The bigger the reason.
I haven't done anything.
- I have a letter to Mr. Wikner.
- Just throw it in the slot.
Impressive man, don't you think?
At least he does.
- You seem unaware of what happened here?
- Who shot whom and why?
Nobody was shot. But your neighbour, mrs. Brink, has committed suicide.
She hanged herself. Get out of bed so we can continue our conversation.
- Have you lived here a long time?
- For three years together.
I had the apartment before we got married.
Pardon my tone. I didn't know it was so serious. You had a letter.
We found it on her desk... it's addressed to you and your wife.
There's no doubt it was suicide, but we want it confirmed.
She writes:
"Dear neighbours..."
"I have just decided to end my meaningless existance."
"I have no relatives nor friends who are close to me-
- which is why i wish, in my right mind-
- to testament all my belongings to you, author and wife Anders Wikner."
"Do what you want with it. Sell what you have no use for."
"Money for the funeral can be found in my bankbook in the bottom left drawer."
"Sorry for the inconvenience. Stockholm
22/10, 1949. Dagmar Brink."
She writes that she didn't have any close friends. Weren't you?
- No, we didn't know her.
- It's quite unusual.
To me, this is settled. It might be trickier for you, though.
The testament is not legally valid, since it isn't certified.
But unless any relatives make any claims, I wouldn't worry about it.
I'll take the keys so the estate administrator can come to me.
- A fuse must have gone.
- There's no lamp.
- Do you think...?
- Probably.
- Shouldn't we wait until tomorrow?
- We're here now.
- That should make it more pleasant.
- Pleasant is hardly the right word.
The desk is nice. We're keeping it.
So you won't have to write in bed.
Nobody's going to make me write one word outside of bed.
The kind of books you'd expect.
Mostly poetry.
Boye. Gullberg, Södergran...
- Should we keep the radio phonograph?
- If I don't have to hear the radio...
There's lots of records.
Both modern and classical.
- Beethoven and Tchaikovsky.
- How did you know?
By her looks. She has underlined a poem by Södergran.
I shall be silent for the rest of my life
A speaker is but a yapping stream, turning on itself
A lonely tree I shall be on the plains
The trees in the forest die, yearning for storm
I shall be sound from top to toe with golden streaks in my blood
I shall be pure and innocent like a flame licking its lips.
- High ideals.
- Yes.
Why did she kill herself?
I would like to find those responsible for her death.
- Maybe it was her own fault.
- No, and I'm going to figure it out.
- How are you supposed to figure it out?
- "Girl with hyacinths".
- What do you mean?
- It's her. From the newspaper.
- Who painted this?
- Can't you tell? Elias Körner.
Elias Körner...
So we'll start with him.
DEAD
DRUNK
Hello... anybody home?
Hello...?
- What is it?
- I'd like to see Mr. Körner.
- What's going on?
- Some man wants to talk to you.
- My throat is dry. Come back later.
- He says to come back later.
- How much later?
- When his throat isn't dry. Bugger off.
Morning.
Hey, there... wake up.
Here's one crown.
Orders from Körner. Go out and buy three litres of milk.
- Mr. Wikner wants to see the banker.
- Don't know him. Ask what he wants.
- It's about Dagmar Brink.
- Let him in.
Wikner? You may sit down.
Please keep it short.
- I'm expecting a visit.
- I saw you on Dagmar Brink's funeral.
- Yes, so what?
- Do you know why she killed herself?
No, I hardly knew her.
I went to the funeral because
I'm an old friend of her mother.
So I saw - in the parish registers.
With what right are you prying in other people's private lives? Go away.
As you wish. Don't let me bother your guilty conscience.
Stop!
Sit down.
I only met Dagmar Brink on one occasion.
It was new year's 1946 in this room.
I was looking at a man shoveling snow on the roof across the road.
I thought: "Hell knows, if you're not enjoying yourself more than I am".
Then the buzzer rang.
A Mrs. Brink wants to see the banker.
Dagmar Brink.
Tell her to come in.
- Good day, Mr. Banker.
- Good day.
Please sit down?
What can I do for you?
As you know, my mother died 10 years ago, and since then I've taken care of myself.
It has been rough. I was hoping that it wouldn't have to come to this-
- but now I need 5.000 crowns.
And I have nowhere else to turn.
- Excuse me, but why ask me?
- You're my father.
I'm sorry, but neither of us can be sure about that. Unfortunately.
My mother was, and she never lied to you nor to me.
Dear Mrs. Brink. I regret to tell you, that when your mother and I were together-
- she was unfaithful.
She admitted it herself.
Yes, once. When you were abroad for 6 months in the beginning of your relationship.
- She told you the day you came home.
- You're very well-informed.
- Then you also know I forgave her.
- Yes. But two years later, when she got pregnant...
...you took that forgiven mis-step as a reason to break up with her through a letter.
- You abandoned her when she needed you most.
- I gave her 5.000 crowns to open a hairdresser's salon.
Listen to yourself. It was a loan, and she paid back every nickel.
You accepted them anyway, and those are the 5.000 crowns I'm asking for now.
Honestly, I can't see why I should give you any money.
But for the sake of your mother, I'll write you a cheque of 1.000 crowns.
- I said 5.000.
- And I said 1.000.
- I still have that letter.
- What letter?
A farewell letter to my mother, written one month before you got married.
To a lady "of your own class".
Unfortunately, it's dated.
- Blackmailing is a felony.
- You'd be worse off than me.
What are my guarantees that this situation won't happen again?
You'll get the letter back.
Here you go. I'm glad that your mother didn't have to live through this.
Yes, and that's thanks to you.
Good day, Mr. Banker.
That was my first and only encounter with Dagmar Brink.
- Do you think she was your daughter?
- I hope that she wasn't.
Then why did you attend the funeral?
- Attorney Ryhner is here.
- Send him in.
I'm afraid I'm busy.
Good day.
Applauding that would be charity.
- Is it Miss Wiklund?
- Formerly.
Is it about a lawsuit or an old debt?
- You lived at Olavsgatan 13, no?
- Yes, but I've paid the rent.
- Can we go somewhere and talk?
- Yes, I'd like a gin & tonic, thank you.
There's a pub downstairs.
That one is mine. Put the bottles on the table, we're not going swimming.
- Where is Ekberg?
- The manager went to the ticket box.
If he asks, it's 2 2 in mine and 7 2 in his.
Farewell to sense and sanity, as my husband likes to say.
But when it comes to him, there's not a lot to bid farewell.
I knew Dagmar Brink, but I don't have anything special to tell you about her.
But we met in a funny way, of course.
It was on a Christmas eve, just before I married Viktor.
It was 1946, and we were sitting down here, the whole ensemble.
Ekberg owns both this pub and the theatre.
It's a tradition that we celebrate
Christmas here together.
We sat over there. We were living it up.
Laughing and singing.
Viktor was a bit cranky, because
I had just passed him one sausage.
But that was the only quibble. Nylander recited "Clown Clopopisky".
As he always does after four shots.
But nobody listened to him.
Except Viktor, who felt sentimental.
And then Dagmar Brink came in.
And did his best circus number, and stood on his head, and then...
And that's it.
Are you alone?
What will it be?
- Just the daily menu.
- Sandwich or dinner?
- Sandwich.
- Anything to drink?
Mineral water.
14 years old I believe that I was
Just a girl and so happy because
Not a suitor as far as I could see
But that was all the same to me
- What's the matter? Are you crying?
- As a matter of fact I am.
- But why?
- Look at her over there.
Like a lonely little sparrow.
With no sheaf.
- It's not that bad, I think.
- Oh, you have a heart of stone, Hugge.
Look at us, with our hams and sausages and our pâté.
She's nibbling on three dry sandwiches and drinking water.
- Invite her over here, then.
- Such a good person you are.
- Why are you crying?
- I'm thinking of "Clown Clopopisky".
You're drunk.
My name is Gullan Wiklund.
I'm sorry to impose-
- but you looked so lonely. Wouldn't you like to sit with us?
- Sure, but I don't know anyone.
- We're just revue actors.
- And it's Christmas. Come over to us.
- Thank you.
Don't mind Viktor. He's had a few drinks too many.
Make yourself at home.
- There's a letter here.
- A letter? Oh, it's from my friend!
I have a friend, if you see what I mean.
It shall be interesting to see what kind of figures he's treating me to this time.
He's sweet and nice but not very generous.
You'll be lying there.
It's very comfortable.
I'll be...?
A cheque for 1 000 crowns!
Now he's so over the hill that he can't tell how many zeroes he jots down.
Light some candles and make it cozy.
Excuse me. I'll just read what he wrote.
Well, I never...!
What is it?
After eight years. Farewell on grey paper.
"Thank you for the time we've shared."
"As you understand, you can no longer count on my financial support."
And guess what his excuse is?
He's become a grandfather.
I bet he's found someone younger and prettier. "I've become a grandfather!"
Well, that's just great.
Who will pay for the apartment?
- Do you want to take it over?
- But what about you?
Don't worry about me.
Viktor, it's Gullan.
The answer is "yes".
I said, the answer is "yes".
Don't cry over that.
Now he's crying over that too.
Yes, you know that I love you.
Yes, I do. Go to sleep.
So Dagmar and I lived together, until I married Viktor.
We didn't see each other much. She got a job at Ritz' bar and I was at the theatre.
- One could never figure her out.
- In what way?
- Can I pay?
- One moment.
There was something rather odd about her.
She was difficult to reach out to.
She was locked inside her own head.
But we were very different, of course.
- You don't know from where she came that Christmas?
- No, she never wanted to say.
But I overheard the address when she called the moving company.
It was Höglundsgatan 37.
I've forgotten the name.
Come in, god damnit!
- What the hell is it?
- I wanted to see Mr. Körner.
Elias, the idiot who tricked me into buying milk, he's here.
- So it's him?
- Yes.
That was damn funny.
Did you hear? Elias Körner, laughing.
Have a sip.
No, I'll be back later.
Too posh to drink straight from the bottle? Goddamn clean-cut...
Clean-shaved philistine!
Get out of here.
Don't come back.
He was right. You are a clean-cut philistine.
But you write like an analphabet.
What does it say here?
An analphabet can't write at all.
But you're one, since you can't read.
Yes, what does it say? It's not easy when you're writing in bed.
- "Anthropomorphizing", it says...
- What does it mean?
Anthropos means human and morph figure. It's Greek.
- Nobody will get that.
- Yes, those who are supposed to will.
- Ah, what is it now?
- Find something to drink. We're having a visitor.
Is it impossible to get some peace of mind here?
Not even a bottle to yourself.
- Good evening.
- Step inside.
Anders... this is Captain Brink.
Dagmar's former husband.
Wikner... please come in.
I saw your names in Dagmar's death notice.
It's none of my business... but how did she die?
- She...
- Killed herself.
- Yes.
- I almost knew it.
- So you know why she did it?
- No, not at all.
But I'm not surprised.
She was that kind of person.
She was different. Hard to get close to.
Even though we were married for 4 years,
I wasn't sure what she thought or felt.
- But I suppose this doesn't interest you.
- Quite the opposite.
Her persona is very interesting to me.
It's hard to think about the fact that she could have been alive-
- and the two of us married, if I hadn't opened that letter.
It was a few months after we got married.
I came home early one day.
We lived out in the suburbs.
There was a letter to Dagmar.
It was sent from Paris.
She was at the dentist's in town.
Shortly before dinner she called.
She said that she'd be late and that I shouldn't wait for her before eating.
I had already been glancing at that letter for a couple of hours.
So I gave in to the temptation and opened it.
It was a love letter from someone named Alex.
It was all too evident that they had loved each other-
- and that he still did.
I was sealing the envelope when I heard the door open.
- Hi. You ate, I suppose?
- Yes.
So where's the "thank you for dinner"-kiss?
Or is there none because I wasn't home?
Let me look at you. Did something happen?
Has Adelsvärd taunted you again?
No, but it was a bummer having to have dinner by myself.
That's the sound of a newly-wed.
Can you tell that I'm swollen?
No... be quiet, please.
According to L'agenzia Stefani, German vanguards marched into Paris today-
- through Port St. Denis.
When the Germans entered Paris, the city streets were empty.
Most remaining inhabitants stayed inside or in the shops.
The blinds were drawn, and deadly silence...
- What are you doing?
- It's appalling.
No worse than when they entered
Brussels, Amsterdam or Warsaw.
- They're vile.
- But damn good soldiers.
That rotten and corrupted France needs some cleaning up.
- You sound like a nazi.
- I admire them, as an officer.
But I don't sympathize with them.
Please, let's not discuss politics.
No, let's not.
- Dagmar...?
- Yes.
Could you answer me honestly?
Have you loved someone before me?
- Why are you asking me that now?
- I know so little about you.
Enough not to have to ask that question, I think.
You can love someone without a relationship coming out of it.
I don't know why you're bringing it up, but I'll give you an honest answer.
I have never a loved a man before you, Stefan.
I don't understand why she lied to me that time.
And you never told her that you had read the letter from Alex?
That would have equalled divorce.
She would have forgiven me cheating on her-
- but never reading one of her letters.
I burned it the same evening, but it didn't help.
I couldn't forget that she had lied to me.
It changed everything between us.
I couldn't trust her anymore.
And she could tell... well,
I'd better be going.
Thank you for listening. It felt good to speak out.
- I haven't done that before. Good night.
- I'll follow you out.
- Do you think she was unfaithful?
- Do you?
- No.
- Why not?
- She wasn't that type.
- She lied about Alex.
Not necessarily. We can't know for sure what that letter said.
A jealous and suspecting man is not to be counted on.
But I do know, that she loved Alex.
Do you?
How could you know?
- I'll tell you tomorrow. Sleep now.
- You're joking.
Believe what you want. You won't hear it tonight anyway. Turn off the light.
Good night.
- Anders, coffee's ready.
- I'm on my way.
I wonder if that Elias Körner is sober today?
Hi... did you sleep well?
- Must you read the paper at the table?
- If I don't, you will.
- Are you in a bad mood?
- No. But I've been dreaming about that damn Alex.
So, will you tell me now?
Hey?
Will you tell me now?
It was in the beginning of our relationship... February, 1947.
As usual, you had been too lazy to walk me home.
- Can I come in for a second?
- Not now. I was on my way to bed.
Oh no, you weren't.
- What's this supposed to mean?
- I don't like to pry in other's business.
But when it comes to suicide,
I consider it my obligation.
Can't we sit down?
You sit.
I prefer to stand.
Why did you want to do it?
Why would I tell you?
I don't even know your name.
Britt Söderberg. Advertising director at Langes publishing company.
- I live across the hall.
- Dagmar Brink.
Please, Miss Brink.
Sit down.
Mrs. Brink.
I was married once.
Drink this.
It's calming.
So, won't you tell me? Not for my sake, but for your own.
There's nothing to tell.
I just can't take it anymore.
I'm sorry... it's over now.
I'm of the hopeless kind, that asks too much of life and people around me.
I want them to be good, and real and kind...
...and when they aren't,
I take it very badly.
And I never learn. After each strike,
I get up, naive and hopeful-
- with the same demands.
And then I take the next strike.
I'm like one of those dolls you played with as a child-
- with a leaden weight under the feet.
But it happens that they break.
Surely there's someone who hasn't let you down.
Yes, one... but that day might come-
- and then I don't want to be around no more.
- So it's over for now?
- Yes, the doll is back on the feet.
- Ready for the next strike.
- Try accepting life as it is.
And not having so high expectations?
And you have one.
Isn't that enough?
- We can never have each other.
- Don't be so sure.
No, in this case I can be completely sure.
I'm going to bed now.
Thank you for coming over.
- You don't have to worry. You can go.
- I'd rather see you in bed first.
Can you take a sleeping pill?
Go to bed.
Then call for me and I'll see you to sleep.
As you wish.
I'm done now.
- Did you take the sleeping pill?
- Yes.
- Can I take care of the others...?
- No.
- Should I stay here until you're asleep?
- Yes. I would like that.
Fall into slumber like a sweet little girl.
- Can I hold your hand?
- Of course.
It's been a long time since
I went to sleep like this.
Now the church bells are chiming downtown. Can you hear them, Alex?
Sleep now.
It's good to be alive.
Don't you think?
Yes.
Never leave me, Alex.
Promise me.
I love you so much.
All too much.
Why did you never tell me this?
I thought it was none of your business.
So she lied to her husband.
But it doesn't make sense.
- It doesn't fit with her character.
- I don't think so either.
Alex was apparently the love of her life.
How could she be so sure that they could never have each other?
Maybe he was married, or dead.
But she feared that the day would come, when he'd let her down.
No, dead he wasn't.
'Til later. See you at dinner.
This is what she looked like when I got to know her.
Well, it's how I saw her. I called it "Girl with hyacinths".
That was stupid. I should have called it "Miss Lonely".
The first time I saw her was at
Ritz' bar. It was the spring of '45.
She played there. Never had I seen a person who looked so lonely.
Well, not counting the mental patients on Beckonberget.
But that's another story. I was at the beginning of one of my cycles-
- and I had been staring at her all night long.
- Can I buy you a glass of red wine?
- I'm on my way home.
No, don't be. For I'm asking you in the nicest possible way, little Miss Lonely.
Sit with me for a while. You see,
I'm just as lonely as you.
Come here.
You don't have to say anything.
I just want to look at you.
I know that you think that I'm a creepy bloke.
How could a fair and tender fairytale princess like you...
A fairytale princess who plays swing... Just a thought.
How could she find me anything but ugly and repulsive?
Look at my nails.
It looks like drunk snails tried to crawl in under them to hide.
But they failed to do so.
My poor little snails.
To be sickened by oneself and hate oneself - yes, that is easy.
"That is very easy." Do you know who wrote that?
If you will model for me
I'll tell you.
There are so many pretty things I want to tell you about, little Miss Lonely.
Let me paint your portrait. It's quite an honor to be painted by Elias Körner.
One day I will be up there with the big names... the big and lonely.
Let's settle it.
You will come to my studio...
Höglundsgatan 37...
Monday 24th...
Let's say at 11? Then this cycle will be over.
You will be surprised at how different I am.
- Say that you will come.
- On one condition.
- Which one, Miss Lonely?
- That you get rid of the snails. Good night.
So, what do you think?
- Artistically, it's excellent.
- Don't you think it looks like you?
Yes... and yet not.
I'm not that deep and mysterious.
It's more of yourself than of me.
Oh no, you're exactly that lonely girl.
The one who waits for something that she knows will never be.
No, you don't know it yourself, or you don't want to admit it.
Isn't it beautiful and soothing...
... to look at a rainy town through a window...?
Soaking tin roofs... a lonely umbrella in a doorway-
- and the huddling pigeons on the windowsills.
Rain...
It makes me think about my mother.
I guess I wasn't what she had hoped for.
- Were you often lonely as a child?
- Yes.
So was I.
So she quit her job at Ritz and moved in here.
We didn't want to get married.
Neither of us believed in marriage-
- and deep down we both knew that it wouldn't last anyway.
But we never admitted it to each other. Poor soul.
She didn't know what was coming.
What I was like at my worst.
We were happy on and off. There could be months without me touching a bottle.
But then it came. I could be away at daytime and she had to run around town-
- only to find me in a reeking watering hole-
- or with booze pushers in some basement in Old Town. Or at the police station.
It can't have been nice to take care of me at those moments.
Would you like to undress and wash a stinking, unconscious carcass?
She did that.
After three cycles in a year, she was as washed up as I was.
Come and eat.
- I can't.
- You will try.
- You and your nagging.
- I'm not doing it for myself.
Then why don't you get out?
Realise that I'm a lost cause.
There's no use in fighting it.
I just end up pulling you down with me.
Why don't you leave, before it's too late?
- I love you.
- It's just something you tell yourself.
Nobody can love me. It's just pity.
And I don't want that.
You and your Good Samaritan-inclinations.
Your compassion chokes me.
I can't stand the look in your eyes.
That eternally forgiving look.
- It could be so good.
- Yes, if you left.
- No, if you did.
- So that's what you wanted.
You want to put me in an institution, but you can forget about that.
I know all about those places and their meddlesome nurses and doctors-
- who have so many patients that they can't even remember your name.
There's a doctor in Switzerland who has opened a clinic with new methods.
He has cured all his patients, but it takes half a year.
And that's where you want me.
Who will pay for that trip?
It costs no more than 8.000 crowns.
No more than 8.000 crowns?
Where the hell would I get that?
Can't you get an advance down at the salon?
I have a fixed salary of 500 crowns a month. It's hardly likely.
But if you can get the last 5.000,
I'd be happy to go.
- Do you promise?
- Yes.
- Where are you going?
- Never you mind.
- What are you looking for?
- A letter.
I hope I won't have to use it.
Whether you believe it or not, she came back that same afternoon-
- and laid out five of those bills in front of me.
I wondered where she got them from.
She wouldn't tell me.
There was nothing to do but pack up and leave. I had made a promise.
I came home after six months, disgustingly sound and healthy-
- choking on fresh air...
With rosy cheeks, bursting with creativity.
The happiest months of our life together followed.
We hardly went out at all.
We stayed home at evenings-
- listening to radio and reading books.
Once in a blue moon we went to the movies.
I didn't touch a bottle.
I never met any of my drinking buddies and I painted like a maniac.
Allow me to show you one of the results...
- Well, what do you think?
- I'm not an expert, but...
- A tad banal, isn't it?
- No it isn't.
It's as mindblowingly banal and devoid of life as a painting could ever be.
But I didn't see it.
I just kept painting.
And suddenly it was Christmas.
Lacking money, as usual, I brought a couple of paintings to one of my regular customers.
He was a know-it-all, and he told me the truth.
It was quite a scene. I told him to go to hell and left.
I walked out on the street, leaned some of the paintings against the concrete wall-
- and looked at them. It struck me that the man had been absolutely right.
It was early one Christmas morning.
Is it Kjell?
It's Dagmar.
Merry Christmas... I suppose Elias isn't with you?
So he isn't...?
We had decided that we...
Oh, here he is.
Say hello to Maja.
Merry fucking Christmas!
And Christmas tree and tinkering lights...
And nuts... and raisins...
And Christmas Pig with an apple in his mouth.
And a sheaf, and Christmas presents...
Well, isn't that dandy.
"To Elias, my love, from former Miss Lonely."
What can it be? A home-knit scarf or a pair of slippers?
And I know what's in this package.
It's a nail cleaner.
And children singing on the radio.
Why don't you say something?
Say that I'm an asshole, a scumbag.
5.000 crowns shot to hell.
Where did you get them, by the way?
Is little Miss Lonely a blackmailer?
Such cruel methods against old lovers to make the new one healthy-
- so he can... paint many new paintings.
That one got its worth.
Now I can breathe again.
Do you understand what you have done, in order to make us "happy"?
You have crippled me as a painter.
But I'm not dead just yet.
I wasn't put on this earth to make us happy, but to paint.
And that's what I'll do.
So what now?
Now it's no good anymore.
And little Miss Lonely is departing.
Just go already, and take the scarf, and the nail cleaner...
And the marzipan pig and your goddamn church made of plaster.
I'm through with you, and your kind.
You inane wretches with your false notions of happiness!
What the hell do you know about happiness?
You who don't even know suffering.
Good for you, that you don't even realise-
- how damn hollow and empty your lives are.
Because if you did, you would kill yourselves!
Good riddance, little Miss Lonely!
I drank for two days straight until I passed out.
When I woke up, she had fetched her things and left.
On the table laid the keys and a ring I gave her sometime.
The only gift I ever presented to her.
We never saw each other again.
You think that I was a bastard, of course, and that we shouldn't have parted like that-
- but that is also the only thing that I regret.
I like my snails.
We belong together.
Now there's a meaning to what I do.
- The portrait isn't for sale?
- No, it isn't.
It's my best work, but that's not why I want to keep it.
But wait. I made a couple of sketches before that.
I have them somewhere here.
This is the best one.
Take it.
- It's too kind of you.
- I don't want money.
It wouldn't feel right.
- Who is it?
- Willy Borge, he used to be popular.
- Dagmar has one of his albums.
- I can't believe it.
I know that guy. We went to secondary school together.
- He was a sleazebag even then.
- Did he take some girl away from you?
Oh God, no. That's the silliest thing I've ever heard.
- When was he popular?
- Around the start of World War Il.
- And she had a whole album of his?
- Yes, so? Lots of girls do.
- What are you after?
- Borge, Willy. Advertising assistant.
- It must be him.
- Oh, you can't call him up.
There's no harm in trying.
Is it the Willy Borge who went by the nickname "The Pea"?
- Oh yes, it's "The Pea" speaking.
- I just wanted to ask you a question.
You never knew a girl named
Dagmar Brink?
I can't explain over the phone.
Can I come over to you?
I'm on my way.
I first met her at one of those awful charity concerts at Blue Hall.
It was in 1943. I performed there.
One used to be a popular singer.
She was selling some sort of badge...
One moment.
This is a good one... tonight?
Well, it's hard to say now...
There could always be a better offer, you know.
Can I phone back...?
No, I just mean...
This could take a while.
I know.
I don't mind them being stupid,
I just wish they talked less.
Come again? No, I don't have a girl over here.
Why must women always be so jealous?
Great, she's crying.
Guess I'll have to pull the plug.
Dagmar, you said... well, long story short-
- I bought all her badges, and when the soirée was over-
- I suggested that we should go to my place and listen to my latest recordings.
Well, I don't think they're any more romantic than you do-
- but the girls usually like them, and that's the main thing.
I made sure to always give them an album as a present.
This album contains my best recordings.
I would be happy-
- if you would take it as a memory of this evening.
- Like how many girls before me?
- None, Dagmar. I swear.
Deep down I'm a very lonely person.
Lonely, and an incurable romantic... which is why I'm lonely, I guess.
Our generation is afraid of romance.
We'd rather jump out a window than acknowledge our need for tenderness.
- Maybe we don't have a need.
- Sure we do. Don't you?
I suppose I do... but I don't feel it for just anyone.
- You mean me...?
- Among many others.
- How long have you been married?
- Three years.
- Why are you unhappy?
- I should go now.
No, don't. I won't ask any more questions like that.
- Are the walls thin here?
- No. Are you going to scream?
No.
- Continue. You play well.
- There's no continuation.
- Why is that?
- I lost my inspiration.
What was his name?
You're mistaken.
There was no him.
That's what's wrong with you.
You have never really loved anyone.
- Haven't I?
- Not happily, at least.
I can see it in your eyes.
- Will you call for a car now?
- I could make you so happy.
Call now.
Believe it or not - I called for a car and even drove her home.
To the suburbs... I, who never drive girls home.
So it wasn't one of your more successful nights.
Quite the opposite. You'll think I'm crazy-
- but I'm glad that nothing happened.
It remained a nice memory.
- I don't have too many of those.
- Was that the only time you met her?
Oh no, but it was another year until we met again.
I had done a tour for the conscripted and arrived at the train station, pissed off.
- Dagmar, why are you standing here?
- I just said goodbye to my husband.
What a coincidence. Let's spend the evening together. Is this your bag?
This month has been a drag and now I'm making up for it.
How do you like my cocktail cabinet?
Snazzy, eh? 950 crowns.
But then again, it was a limited edition.
- What would you like to drink?
- I think I've had enough.
But a glass of champagne at least?
I'll get it cold in a minute.
- Not for me.
- As you please.
So how long will your husband be gone?
Forever... we're getting divorced.
We decided it today.
You don't say...?
Well, that can happen.
- I guess it feels strange?
- Yes.
- I'm glad I'm not the reason.
- But you are.
What are you saying?
When I came home that night after the soirée, my husband was waiting for me.
Oh, darn. Well, there you go.
One figures what he must have thought.
He should have known me better.
But he never trusted me.
I wonder why that is?
So you were modest for nothing that time.
- Not for me.
- I mean for his sake.
A more cynical man might say that we've got one on hold.
That's what I was thinking about when you appeared at the station.
You don't say? Are you sure that I shouldn't put that champagne on cooling?
- No, but will you call for a car?
- What are you saying?
I'm sorry to disappoint you. It was a mistake to come over here.
Dagmar, you can't walk out on me again.
I have missed you. I've been thinking about you every day.
- Don't you understand that I love you?
- You know that's not true.
There's just one person you've always loved. Yourself.
Why would you hurt me like that?
Don't be melodramatic. It doesn't suit you.
Call for a car now.
There was nothing left to do, but at least she had to drive herself home that time.
- And you gained another memory.
- You can have too many of those, too.
- She was a peculiar girl.
- Why? She didn't love you.
Actually, she did, and that would manifest itself later.
Don't tell this to anyone, but the reason that she took her life was-
- that she was unlucky in love with me.
The night before it happened, a friend called me.
He had found two fine ladies at Aldon's Bar.
I hurried down.
One was a redhead.
Dagmar playing there didn't bother me at all.
The females were lookers. Two Swedes who had just returned from abroad.
We sat a couple of hours and filled ourselves up.
When Dagmar finished playing, the redhead yelled at her-
- because they went to school together, and we kept going at my place.
- Wasn't it atrocious?
- It wasn't that bad.
- Bénédictine or cacao?
- Is there no cognac?
I got by quite well.
My German has always been good.
- So you worked for them?
- Yes, it was that or hell.
It's easy to sit here and frown and talk about opportunism.
- Here's a cognac.
- I've always liked Germans, anyway.
- What did you work with?
- This and that.
Nothing for your clean little fingers, I can assure you.
But when you're knee-deep in shit, you're not afraid to touch it after a while.
- Another glass?
- Pour it up.
I've drunk stronger men than you under the table.
- Germans can't take much.
- I've partied with all nationalities.
And more than that?
- So we're heading in to me?
- I don't think so.
- Why not?
- I don't have time for that reward.
- So, how have you been?
- Why, fine.
- You haven't changed, Dagmar.
- I can't say the same.
Play something cheerful. A samba.
- Can you dance samba, Willy?
- As long as I'm holding you...
- I'm crazy about red hair.
- Even if it's fake?
- I hope they'll leave soon.
- Are you sleepy?
- No, are you?
- No... do we really have to wait?
- It would make a better impression.
- Right now, I'd like to make a bad impression.
In that case...
We had barely closed the door before she stopped playing.
When we returned, she was gone.
And the next day, dead.
- It's unfathomable.
- That's the story.
She may have loved me from the beginning without knowing it.
When she saw me in someone else's arms, she realised and it was too late.
I should put the plug back in.
There could be an order on the way.
- So the mystery of Dagmar Brink is solved.
- Poor Anders. Are you bummed?
Yes, I am. I wish that I had never got involved in this story.
Humans never cease to amaze.
Or disillusionise.
A woman who I thought was one in a thousand...
- ...was just a run-of-the-mill person.
- I don't think she was.
Then again, you haven't met Willy Borge.
If you kill yourself over him, you're an average person at best.
The mystery that never was is solved.
We've found out everything of importance.
There's nobody left to ask.
I'm having a cup of tea.
- There is one.
- Who?
The red-haired girl she went to school with.
Whatever she knows doesn't change anything.
I never heard her name.
- I'd like to get ahold of her.
- Call Borge. "The plug" is connected.
My name is Mrs. Wikner. My husband forgot to ask about something.
The red-haired girl who was at your place with Dagmar...
What was her name?
- What did you call her?
- Alex.
Her real name was Alexandra, but I forgot her last name.
It doesn't matter.
Sorry to bother you.
Alex, I love you so much.
All too much.
We can never have each other.
There's just one, who hasn't let me down.
But that day might come. And then
I don't want to be around anymore.
Did you find out her name?
No, he had forgotten.

I don't understand...
I just don't understand.
I don't understand it at all.
I just don't understand.
What's wrong?
What don't you understand?
I've never heard such a strange story.
Why don't you tell me about it?
We happen to have a wise priest in our midst.
No, not even the renowned, wise priest from Kiyomizu Temple has heard a story as strange as this.
So you know something about this strange story?
This man and I have just seen it and heard it ourselves.
- Where?
- In the courthouse garden.
The courthouse?
A man was murdered.
Just one? So what?
On top of this gate, you'll find at least five or six unclaimed bodies.
You're right.
War, earthquake, winds, fire, famine, the plague...
Year after year, it's been nothing but disasters.
And bandits descend upon us every night.
I've seen so many men getting killed like insects, but even I have never heard a story as horrible as this.
Yes. So horrible.
This time, I may finally lose my faith in the human soul.
It's worse than bandits, the plague, famine, fire, or war.
Look here, priest.
Enough with the sermon.
It sounded interesting, at least while I kept out of the rain.
But if it's a sermon,
I'd sooner listen to the rain.
Hear me out. Maybe you can tell me what it means.
I don't understand any of those three.
- Which three?
- Well...
I'll tell you about them.
Calm down and tell me slowly.
The rain's not going to stop any time soon.
RASHOMON
It was three days ago.
I went into the mountains to get wood.
I ran as fast as I could to tell the police.
Then, three days later... today...
I was called to testify.
Yes. That's right.
I was the one who first found the body.
What? Did I see a sword or something?
No, nothing at all.
Just a woman's hat caught on a branch, and the cap of a samurai that had been trampled on.
There was a cut-up piece of rope near the body, and further along in the leaves, a shiny amulet case with red lining.
Yes.
That was all I found, yes.
Yes.
I met the murdered man before his death.
It was three days ago, in the afternoon.
On the road from Sekiyama to Yamashina.
The woman had a veil, so I couldn't see her face.
The man was armed with a sword, as well as a bow and arrows.
Little did I expect that he would meet such a fate.
A human life is truly as frail and fleeting as the morning dew.
What a shame that his should end this way.
I'm sorry.
This man I caught is Tajomaru.
Yes, the notorious bandit everyone speaks of.
The last time I almost caught him, he looked the same and he carried that same sword.
It was two days ago at dusk, by the banks of the Katsura...
What's wrong?
There were 17 arrows with eagle feathers,
a leather bow, and a horse.
All these belonged to the dead man, yes.
The irony of Tajomaru being thrown off his stolen horse, this had to be fateful retribution.
I fell off the horse?
You fool!
On that day...
I was riding that horse and I was suddenly very thirsty.
So around Osaka,
I drank from a spring.
There must have been a dead poisonous snake upstream.
After a while, I got an incredible stomachache.
By the time I came to the river,
I couldn't hold it any longer.
So I got off the horse and crouched in the field.
I fell off?
Obviously, a fool can think only foolish thoughts.
I know sooner or later you'll have my neck, so I'm not going to hide anything.
It was this Tajomaru who killed that man.
I saw that couple three days ago.
It was a hot afternoon.
Suddenly a cool breeze rustled the leaves.
If it hadn't been for that wind,
I wouldn't have killed him.
I caught a glimpse and then she was gone.
Maybe that's why.
I thought I saw a goddess.
At that moment I decided to capture her, even if I had to kill her man.
But if I could have her without killing, all the better.
My intention then was to take her without killing the man.
But I couldn't do it on that road to Yamashina.
What do you want?
What do you want?
What is it?
Don't be suspicious.
See? Isn't this nice?
Take a good look at it.
There are some ruins over there.
When I dug up the mound, I found a heap of swords and mirrors.
I buried them in a grove behind the mountain so no one else would find them.
If you're interested,
I'll sell them to you cheap.
It's over there.
Walk ahead of me.
It's here. Beyond those pines.
Your husband has taken sick.
Her face turned pale.
She stared at me with frozen eyes, her expression intense like a child's.
When I saw that, I envied the man and I suddenly hated him.
I wanted to show her how pathetic he looked tied to that pine tree.
These thoughts that weren't there before filled my head.
I had never seen such fierceness in a woman.
And so I had succeeded in having her without killing her husband.
I still had no intention of killing him.
But then...
Wait!
Stop!
Either you die or my husband dies.
One of you must die.
To have my shame known to two men is worse than dying.
I will go with the survivor.
So I had to kill him, but I wanted to do it honorably.
He fought very well.
We crossed swords 23 times.
I remember this because I'm still impressed.
No one had ever crossed swords with me more than 20 times.
What? The woman?
I don't know.
When the man died,
I turned to her. She was gone.
The fighting must have scared her and she ran away.
I ran out to the mountain road.
All I found was her horse grazing calmly.
I was attracted to her fierce spirit, but, after all, she was just like other women.
I didn't even look for her.
What? His sword?
I exchanged it in town for liquor.
What? Her dagger?
It had pearl inlay.
Looked very valuable.
I totally forgot about it.
That was foolish.
The biggest mistake I ever made!
Even amongst the bandits,
Tajomaru is famous for being a womanizer.
Why, last fall, a young wife went to the temple and she and her maid were found dead in the mountains.
That must have been him too.
Who knows what really happened to that woman who left her horse?
Well, that woman showed up at the courthouse.
She was hiding in the temple when the police found her.
It's a lie.
It's all a lie.
Tajomaru's story and the woman's.
It's human to lie.
Most of the time we can't even be honest with ourselves.
That may be.
But it's because men are weak that they lie, even to themselves.
Not another sermon.
I don't care if it's a lie, as long as it's entertaining.
What story did the woman come up with?
Well, it's completely different from Tajomaru's story.
So different that her face didn't even show the fierceness he spoke of.
She was so docile, she was almost pitiful.
That man in the blue kimono, after forcing me to yield to him, proudly announced that he was the infamous Tajomaru, and laughed mockingly at my husband who was tied up.
How horrified my husband must have been.
The more he struggled, the tighter the ropes dug in.
I ran to his side. Or rather, I tried to.
Even now, when I think of his eyes, my blood turns cold in my veins.
What I saw in them was neither anger, nor sorrow, but a cold light, a look of loathing.
Don't.
Don't look at me like that.
It's too cruel.
Beat me, kill me, but don't look at me like that.
Please, stop.
Now kill me.
Kill me at once.
Stop.
Don't.
Please don't.
I must have fainted after that.
When I came to and looked around...
Imagine my shock.
I saw my dagger in my dead husband's chest.
I was in shock and I don't remember how I left the woods.
But when I came to,
I was standing by the pond, at the foot of the hill.
I threw myself into the pond.
I tried many different things.
But I failed to kill myself.
What should a poor, helpless woman like me do?
I see. The more I hear, the more confused I get.
But women use their tears to fool everyone.
They even fool themselves.
So you have to beware of the woman's story.
When you hear the dead man's story...
He's dead.
How can he tell his story?
He spoke through a medium.
Lies. His story was also lies.
But dead men don't lie.
Why is that?
I refuse to believe that man would be so sinful.
Suit yourself.
But is there anyone who's really good?
Maybe goodness is just make-believe.
What a frightening...
Man just wants to forget the bad stuff and believe in the made-up good stuff.
It's easier that way.
- Ridiculous.
Nevermind.
Let's hear the dead man's story.
I am in darkness now.
I am suffering in the dark.
Cursed be those who cast me into this dark hell.
After the bandit attacked my wife, he tried to console her.
She sat on the leaves, staring down at her knees.
The bandit was cunning.
Now that her virtue was stained,
she could no longer be with her husband.
Leave the husband and why not marry him instead?
He said he only attacked her out of his love for her.
When she heard that, my wife raised her face as if in a trance.
She had never looked so beautiful.
And what was my beautiful wife's response to the bandit
in front of her helpless husband?
Wherever.
Take me wherever you want.
That's what she said.
But that wasn't her only sin or I wouldn't be suffering in the dark like this.
Please kill him.
While he's alive,
I cannot go with you.
Kill him!
Those words were like a wind that threatened to blow me into the depths of darkness.
Has such a hateful thing ever been uttered by a human before?
Even the bandit turned pale at those words.
Please kill him.
What do you want me to do with her?
Kill her or save her?
You only have to nod.
For these words alone,
I was ready to pardon his crime.
Kill her or let her go?
I don't know how many hours passed.
She got away. Now I'll have to worry about my own fate.
Everything was silent.
I heard someone crying.
Someone is crying.
Who is that?
Everything was silent.
How quiet it was.
Suddenly the sun went away.
I was enveloped in deep silence.
I lay there in the stillness.
Then someone quietly approached me.
That someone gently withdrew the dagger from my heart.
It's not true!
There was no dagger.
He was killed by a sword.
Now it's getting interesting.
It seems you saw the whole thing.
So why didn't you tell the court?
I didn't want to get involved.
You can talk about it here, right?
Tell me, then.
Your story seems to be the most interesting.
I don't want to hear it.
No more horror stories.
They are common stories these days.
I even heard that the demon living here in Rashomon fled in fear of the ferocity of man.
Come on.
How much do you know?
I found the woman's hat in the mountains.
You already said that.
About 20 yards further,
I heard a woman crying.
From behind a bush,
I saw a man tied up, a woman crying and Tajomaru.
So you lied when you said you found the body.
I didn't want to get involved.
All right, then.
Go on.
What was Tajomaru doing?
He was down on his knees, begging the woman for forgiveness.
Until now, whenever I wanted to do something bad, I did it.
That way I suffered less.
But today, it's different.
I already had you, but I only want you more. It's very hard.
I beg you to be my wife.
The notorious bandit Tajomaru is begging you on his hands and knees.
If you wish, I'll even stop being a bandit.
I have enough stashed away to give you a lavish life.
And if you don't want my dirty money,
I'll even work.
I'll stoop to selling odds and ends on the street to support you.
I'll do anything if you come with me.
Marry me, please.
If you say no,
I have no choice but to kill you.
Please, say yes.
Stop crying and answer me.
Tell me you'll be my wife!
Say it!
It's impossible.
How could I, a woman, say anything?
I get it. You mean it's up to us men to decide.
Hold it!
I refuse to risk my life for such a woman.
You've been with two men.
Why don't you kill yourself?
Hopeless.
I don't want this shameless whore.
You can have her.
At this stage, I'd rather lose her instead of the horse.
- Wait!
- Don't follow me!
Stop crying.
It's not going to work anymore.
Stop it. Don't bully her.
Women are weak by nature.
It's you who are weak.
If you are my husband, why don't you kill this man?
Then you can tell me to kill myself.
That's a real man.
You're not a real man either.
When I heard you were Tajomaru,
I stopped crying.
I was sick of this tiresome daily farce.
I thought, "Tajomaru might get me out of this".
"If he'd only save me,
I'd do anything for him".
I thought to myself.
But you were just as petty as my husband.
Just remember: A woman loves a man who loves passionately.
A man has to make a woman his by his sword.
I don't want to die!
So that's the real story.
I don't tell lies.
I saw it with my own eyes.
I doubt it.
It's true. I don't lie.
No one lies after he says he's going to do so.
It's horrifying.
If men don't trust each other, this earth might as well be hell.
That's right. This world is hell.
No, I believe in men.
I don't want this place to be hell.
Shouting doesn't help.
Think about it. Out of these three, whose story is believable?
No idea.
In the end, you cannot understand the things men do.
What are you doing?
What's it to you?
- That's terrible!
- Terrible?
Someone else would have taken the kimono. Why shouldn't I?
- It's evil.
- Evil?
What about this kid's parents?
They had their fun and then they throw out the kid? They're evil.
No, you're wrong.
Look at the amulet on the kimono.
It was left to protect the baby.
Think about what they went through to abandon this baby.
I don't have time to mind everyone's feelings.
- You selfish...
- What's wrong with that?
Dogs are better off in this world.
If you're not selfish, you can't survive.
Damn it.
Everyone is selfish and dishonest.
Making excuses.
The bandit, the woman, the man and you!
And you aren't? That's funny.
You may have fooled the court, but not me.
So what did you do with the dagger?
The valuable one with the pearl inlay that Tajomaru was talking about?
What happened to it?
Did it disappear in the grass?
If you didn't, who stole it?
It seems I'm right.
A bandit calling another a bandit.
Now that's selfish.
Do you have anything else to say?
If not, I'll be going.
What are you doing?
Taking what little it has left?
I have six kids of my own.
Another one wouldn't make a difference.
I am ashamed of what I said.
It's inevitable to be suspicious of others on a day like this.
I'm the one who should be ashamed.
I don't understand my own soul.
No, I'm grateful to you.
Thanks to you,
I think I can keep my faith in man.
Don't mention it.
THE END
(panting)
(car drives by)
Please stop!
Please...
(tries to start engine)
(jazz on radio)
You almost wrecked my car.
Well?
Get in.
(radio) And now, fellas, we'll hear that fine new platter by Nat King Cole,
''I'd Rather Have the Blues''.
(engine starts)
(woman pants and sobs)
# The night is mighty chilly
# And conversation seems pretty silly
# I feel so mean and brought
# I'd rather have the blues than what I've got
# The room is dark and gloomy
# You don't know what you're doing to me
# Your web has got me caught
# I'd rather have the blues than what I've got
(woman starts to calm down)
# All night I walk the city
# Watching the people go by
# I try to sing a little ditty
# But all that comes out is a sigh...
A thumb isn't good enough for you.
You've gotta use your whole body.
Would you have stopped if I'd used my thumb?
No.
What's this all about?
I'll guess. You were out with some guy who thought ''no'' was a three-letter word.
I should've thrown you off that cliff back there. I might still do it.
- Where are you headed?
- Los Angeles.
Drop me off at the first bus stop.
Do you always go around with no clothes on?
(man) What's the trouble, officer?
A woman escaped from an asylum upstate. Young, wearing a trench coat.
- Seen anybody to fit that description?
- No, officer.
OK, move on.
Haven't seen a thing, officer.
- Oh, my wife's been asleep.
- All right, move on.
May I have my hand back now?
So you're a fugitive from the laughing house.
They forced me to go there.
Took away my clothes to make me stay.
Who?
I wish I could tell you that.
I have to tell someone.
When people are in trouble, they need to talk.
But you know the old saying.
What I don't know can't hurt me?
This wheel doesn't feel right. lt keeps pulling over.
- Good evening, folks.
- Check the right front wheel.
What'd you find?
Caught in the spindle.
We must've picked it up when we went off the road back there.
The only thing I ever pick up when I go off the road is poison ivy.
- Thanks, kid.
- Thank you.
- Would you do me a favour, please?
- Wouldn't mind at all.
Would you put a stamp on this and drop it in the mailbox for me?
Yes, ma'am. Anything else, ma'am?
Did you find out what was wrong with the wheel?
Oh, yeah. You picked up a piece of branch when you took that little trip off the road.
So long. Come back again.
You're angry with me, aren't you?
Sorry I nearly wrecked your pretty little car.
I was just thinking how much you can tell about a person from such simple things.
- Your car, for instance.
- What kind of message does it send you?
You have only one real, lasting love.
Now who could that be?
You.
You're one of those self-indulgent males who thinks about nothing but his clothes,
his car, himself...
Bet you do push-ups to keep your belly hard.
You against good health or something?
I could tolerate flabby muscles in a man if it would make him more friendly.
You're the kind of person who never gives in a relationship, who only takes.
Ah, woman. The incomplete sex.
And what does she need to complete her?
Why, man, of course. Wonderful man.
All right, all right, let it go.
That bus stop will be coming up soon and I don't even know your name.
You forget, I'm a loony from the laughing house. All loonies are dangerous.
D'you ever read poetry?
No, of course you wouldn't.
Christina Rossetti wrote love sonnets.
I was named after her.
- Christina?
- Yes, Mike.
I got your name from the registration certificate, Mr Hammer.
Get me to that bus stop and you can forget you ever saw me.
- If we don't make that bus stop...
- We will.
If we don't... remember me.
(Christina screams)
(repeated screams)
(screams continue)
(screams stop)
- She's passed out.
- I'll bring her to.
(3rd man) If you revive her, you know what that would be?
Resurrection, that's what it would be.
And do you know what resurrection means? lt means ''raise the dead''.
Just who do you think you are that you think you can raise the dead?
- (2nd man) Put him in the car too?
- Naturally.
Mike.
Mike.
Hey, Mike.
Mike.
- Hi, Velda.
- Hi.
You're never around when I need you.
You never need me when I'm around.
Pat's here.
Five minutes, that's all you've got. Nurse.
- Hi, flatfoot.
- Hi.
Three days ago I was figuring I'd have to finance a new tux to bury the corpse.
Three days? How am I doin'?
You're doin' all right. In a couple of weeks you'll walk out of here.
Can you remember, Mike?
How it happened, the whole thing?
I never thought I'd smell that again.
Ooh, look at all the goodies.
- I have a cab.
- Mr Hammer?
You won't need the cab.
We'd like to ask you a few questions.
That figures. See you later.
- Why not come in? We may be a while.
- I'll wait here.
We're not getting very far, are we, Mr Hammer?
Well now, we have most of the facts.
All we need is a little more fill-in.
- I almost get killed and he wants fill-in.
- Is it too much to ask for cooperation?
- And make 'em try it again?
- You'll be given full protection.
Maybe we'll have better luck with more elementary questions.
Your full name please, Mr Hammer.
Michael Hammer,
10401 Wilshire Boulevard, Los Angeles.
- Just what do you do for a living?
- He calls himself a private investigator.
- His speciality is divorce cases.
- He's a bedroom dick.
He gets dirt on the wife, then does a deal with the wife to get dirt on the husband.
Plays both ends against the middle.
How do you achieve all this?
You crawl under beds?
- Nothing so primitive.
- He has a secretary, as he calls her.
- What's her name, Mr Hammer?
- Velda Wichman.
She's a very attractive young woman.
Real woo-bait. Lives like a princess.
He sics her onto the husbands and in no time he's ready for the big squeeze.
Who do you sic onto the wives,
Mr Hammer?
That's his department.
All right, you've got me convinced.
I'm a real stinker.
Now if that's all that's on your minds,
I'd like to get home.
Yes, I know. You're anxious to get back to your life's work.
You're free to go.
Open a window.
Thanks for waiting, Pat.
She was a cute kid.
Had the nicest way of needling a guy.
There'll be a long pause before those characters work this out.
The law isn't fast enough, you could do it better - is that it?
Look, Mike, who do you think you are?
What's the pitch, Pat?
An ordinary girl is killed and it rings bells in Washington. Gotta be a pitch.
I'll give you a bit of advice.
Too many people like you have contempt for the law.
You'd like to take it into your own hands.
But when you do that, you might as well be living in a jungle.
I picked up a girl. If she hadn't gotten in my way, I wouldn't have stopped.
She must be connected with something big.
Mike, why don't you tell us what you know, then step aside like a nice fella and let us do our job?
What's in it for me?
Mikey! Mikey!
(gushes in Greek)
Hey, Sammy! Look, my friend just returned from the grave!
Ha-ha! Va-va-voom!
I'm sure glad you're back, Mike.
Like Lazarus, rose out from the grave.
Now tell me, what happened?
Did you drive too fast in that new rod?
Where is it?
Velda says you were picking it up.
There's nothing to pick up.
You ought to have seen that pretty little rod of yours. All torn up. Scrap. Junk.
Never gonna go va-va-voom no more.
Break my heart.
- Anyway, you're all right now?
- A little shaky.
A little shaky, huh?
Know what we're gonna do?
We're gonna pick up a couple of cute little Greek girls!
What I mean, va-va-voom! Pow!
Uh-oh. Forgot to tell you. Some guys were looking for you. Asking a lot of questions.
- What kind of guys?
- Tough guys. Very tough guys, Mike.
Ah, forget it. Look, I'm glad you're back. You look swell.
I'll see you tomorrow.
And take care of yourself, will ya?
Are you all right, Mike?
I don't know yet. Maybe not.
Oh.
Hey, Sammy, what does he mean, ''maybe not''?
Ah, who knows what he means.
(phone rings)
(female voice) This is Crestview 5-4 1 24.
Mr Hammer, whom you are calling, is not available at present.
If you wish to leave a record of your call, please state your message at the tone.
(Velda) Hello, Mike. Just checking to see if you got home. Call me when you...
Velda.
Oh, I'm glad you're there.
Are you all right?
- Sure. Why?
- I'll be right over.
(hangs up)
- What did they want?
- Asked a lot of questions.
- What kind of questions?
- Questions.
When you leave, tell Nick...
What do you want me to tell him?
You know, just to hold the soft part of your arms is a meal...
Tell him to drop his car off tonight and pick it up in the morning.
What's in the folder?
A fella named Ray Diker called up while you were in the hospital.
He wants to see you and I thought you'd want me to check up on him.
(knock at door)
Don't answer it.
(another knock)
Mike? lt's Pat. Official business this time.
Maybe he'll go away.
(lock jiggles)
Go ahead. Don't mind me.
I'm revoking your private investigator's licence.
Also your gun permit.
If I catch you snooping around with a gun in your hand, I'll throw you in jail.
I don't think you'd like it in jail.
Who's Ray Diker?
What do you do with this guy?
He was a reporter on the News, wasn't he? Used to write a science column.
Why did he drop out?
I hear your friends were over to question him too.
I've gotta say it: he's got a nose.
He can sniff out information like nobody I ever saw.
What else did you hear?
Couldn't find him. He dropped out of sight.
Science editor of a newspaper drops out of sight and nobody knows why.
If you know anything, you'd better tell me, Mike.
If I knew anything, I would.
Sure you would.
You ought to tell him, Mike.
- Did Diker leave an address?
- Somewhere over on Flower Street.
But if I were you, I wouldn't go.
- That tape of you and lover-boy got lost.
- There goes your case.
Call him up and set up another session.
Tell him you're sorry, you want to make up for all the pain you gave him...
Give him some of that sincerity.
What'd you find out about the girl?
Christina Georgina Rossetti, poetess, English, born 1830, died 1894.
Your Christina was being held in that hospital for interrogation.
Who by? The feds or state?
That they wouldn't tell me.
What's the point of all this?
If it's any of my business.
She told me if I dropped her off at the bus station I could forget her.
But if she didn't make it, she said... ''Remember me.''
So remember her.
She's dead.
But I'm not dead.
Hey, remember me?
Yeah!
I remember you from somewhere.
Weren't you supposed to call that fellow,
Mr... What's his name?
Friendly?
That's my name for him - Mr Friendly.
He certainly was friendly.
Maybe he'll give you some of that nice dialogue again, that honey talk.
That tape sure was nice.
Do me a favour, will you?
Keep away from the windows.
Somebody might blow you a kiss.
- South.
- Popcorn?
- Yeah. How much?
Dime, like always.
Thank you.
Drop the knife. Drop the knife.
Drop the knife!
(more knocking)
What do you want?
(whispers) Force your way in.
- I want in!
- Who do you think you are?!
(whispers) Make it sound good.
- Make it sound good.
- What's on your mind?
You were with her the night she died.
She knew she was gonna get killed.
- She must've talked to you, told you.
- Told me what?
If you knew, you'd be afraid, like she was afraid.
Like I am. You'd better go.
She told me her name was Christina.
Christina what?
Bailey. Christina Bailey.
Her address, the last place she lived?
325 Bunker Hill.
(loud) If you change your mind and wanna talk, get in touch with my secretary.
(accent) Oh, you are the one.
Every time when I pick up the trunk,
I take a deep breath.
Make you stronger, deep breaths.
This time I think ''Oh, you breathe good deep - trunk feels very light.''
''By golly, old man, you are becoming very strong,'' I think.
But you are the one, eh?
Moving somebody in?
Move in, move out.
Always people come and go.
One place they never leave.
You know, 63 years I live in one place - the house of my body.
Move in when I born, move out when I die.
You bet. Yes, sir.
- Can I help you?
- Oh, no, grazie. I mean thank you.
If you help, then afterward other thing gets heavier.
I go and get the other one.
- What do you want?
- To see the super.
- What can I do for you?
- Card on the mailbox, Christina Bailey.
The police have been through her apartment.
The police have been through her apartment.
I wanna go through her apartment.
- Ask him who he is, Horace.
- Tell her to shut up.
Shut up.
- Can I help you?
- I don't be fooled so easy this time.
Is the young fellow, my deep breath.
Always willing to help an old man moving people around.
Because people, they always move.
They never stand still.
Move from here, from there, and move all the time...
Her lease still has a month to go, but the police said I could rent it.
Whose stuff is this?
We rent it furnished, but she fixed it up to suit herself.
- No bird?
- Her roommate let it die.
- What's her name?
- Carver. Lily Carver.
She moved out a couple of days ago.
All of a sudden, in the middle of the night.
Didn't say where.
(Schubert's ''Unfinished Symphony'' on radio)
She always had it tuned to that station.
OK.
Hey, mister.
Look, mister, you make a deep breath for me. I'm a-gonna tell you a little secret.
The other girl, the roommate of Miss Christina, she tells me not to say.
Afraid, she is.
Like somebody is afraid to die.
I moved her.
I tell you where.
- Buona notte.
- Buona notte.
Come in.
Who are you?
My name is Mike Hammer, if it matters.
What do you want?
I was with Christina the night she was killed.
They tried to kill me too.
If you like, I'll show you the scars.
- How'd you find me?
- Picked up a thread. Anybody could do it.
Mind if I sit down while you're making up your mind?
Christina was my friend.
The bird in the cage, what happened to it? lt was a nice bird.
Used to eat out of my hand.
You let it die. Why'd you let it die? lt reminded me of her every time it sang.
She was a good kid.
She was lots of fun.
We worked together, couple of jobs...
Till she got sick.
That's when I noticed that she started to change.
You get on a merry-go-round and think you can get off any old time.
But then it starts going too fast.
She was scared.
She was more and more scared.
She was afraid to go out.
She'd go to the movies once in a while or out for groceries, but never very far.
Then the police came around.
They asked questions, lots of questions.
Then they took her away.
After a while, I had a feeling someone was watching the place.
Then those men came.
What did they want?
I didn't stick around to find out.
Why was Christina so afraid?
lt's all right, you can trust me.
I don't know.
You wanna get even for what happened to Christina, don't you?
I'll see what I can do.
(train passes noisily by)
(chamber music )
(phone rings)
This is Crestview 5-4 1 24.
Mr Hammer, whom you are calling, is not available at present.
If you wish to leave a record of your call, please state your message at the tone.
(man) Good evening, Mr Hammer.
You will wonder who this is, but it does not matter.
What does matter is that your work has been interrupted, your car wrecked.
Your life has been ruffled - to put it mildly.
If you had not stopped to pick up Christina,
not any of these things would have happened.
So let's pretend you did not pick her up.
- So what happens if I pretend?
- Ah, so there you are, Mr Hammer.
Why, nothing will happen.
Your life will go on as serenely as before.
As a token of our intentions, look in front of your apartment tomorrow morning.
(line goes dead)
Ha-ha! That Mike.
He wrecks one car and goes out and buys another one, just like that!
Wow. Va-va-voom!
Oh, some day I'm gonna get me a car just like this.
I'm gonna get in and I'm gonna drive.
Oh, shines like a million.
Hey, even the keys are in.
Think I'll go around the block and come back before he wakes up. Why not? Pow!
Nick!
- Don't touch anything.
- I didn't.
Turn that key and it's the last thing you'll ever do. Open the hood.
Look under it.
- No, the other side.
- The other side.
Down around the starter.
See anything?
Yeah.
Disconnect it and take it out.
- Is this what you mean?
- Yeah. A torpedo.
- Turn the key and, boom, no more Nick.
- Wow.
- The hood.
- Oh, the hood.
Wow, that was close.
Boy. Oh, boy.
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.
- Are you really sure?
- I said I'm sure.
He's sure.
Pom-pom-porrr...
My moustache! My father's moustache!
Let's go to the freeway.
I wanna see how this bird flies.
- We better stop off at the garage first.
- Why?
- That's the one they expected us to find.
- There's another one?
- You sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.
He's sure.
Find anything?
The sweet little kiss-off. lt's a bomb connected to the speedometer.
Car goes slow, nothing happens, but when you open her up wide...
Va-va-voom?
Hey, Nick.
How'd you like a rod like this one?
- Mine? All mine?
- Down to the last cotter pin.
What do I have to do?
Name it and it's done.
- Can you find out who souped her up?
- A cinch.
I know of a place in Culver City.
I'll dig around and ask a few questions.
- Va-va-voom?
- Va-va-voom.
Nicky, you should ask what it's worth to him. What he's gonna get out of it.
Don't bother me, small fry.
You play your guitar, Sammy-boy, and I'll drive my car.
Voom-voom pow!
Nicky, you're gonna get yourself in a lot of trouble.
(a waltz)
(music back on)
- Did you call your friendly Mr Friendly?
- Yes. He awaits me anxiously.
Then call him back and cancel it.
Forget these penny-ante divorce cases.
I got a line on something better.
That girl was mixed up in something big.
And a cut of something big... could be something big.
I want you to find out all you can about her.
First you find a little thread, the little thread leads you to a string, and the string leads you to a rope... and from the rope you hang by the neck.
What kind of a girl was she, this friend of yours, Christina?
I only ask because Ray Diker phoned up.
He left two names.
He said you might check up on them.
Where are they?
In my typewriter.
Va-Va-Voom says that in Greek your name would be Michali Sfiros.
But under any other name would you be as sweet?
Kawolsky.
Kawolsky.
He was a professional fighter.
His first name was Lee.
Couldn't get anything on Raymondo.
Don't know what he was.
Why do you keep saying ''was''?
They both knew your Christina.
They both died the same way she did.
How was that?
The way you almost died.
Traffic... accident.
One fell out of a cab and the other was run over by a truck.
Who's Carmen Trivago?
Carmen Trivago, a poor man's Caruso, an unemployed opera singer in search of an opera.
Raymondo's friend.
And who's Harvey Wallace?
He drove the truck that ran over Kawolsky.
I was going down Washington Boulevard.
Where they're building that freeway? lt was kinda late. I'd had a long day.
Winter. You know how it gets dark early.
I had my lights on.
I had 'em on. I know that.
Streets are jammed down there around quittin' time.
This was after seven... and the street's empty.
I was goin' under a bridge, and goin', you know?
This guy come out of nowhere.
Did he step out or run out?
- Or maybe he was pushed.
- Yeah, pushed. More like he was pushed.
- Hello, Mike.
- Hi, Eddie.
How do you like my new boy? Kid Nino.
Doesn't he move pretty?
Sure - just like all your fighters, Eddie.
All right, Kid, shadow-box around.
I'm showing you off to a friend. lsn't he beautiful? lsn't he lovely?
Look at the way he moves.
Sure, he's great.
But when he fights his big fight he won't be able to punch his way out of a paper bag.
- Why not, Mike?
- You'll sell him out, like all the others.
Not this one, Mike.
Wait until the odds build up, until you can't resist.
No, Mike.
- When does he go?
- Tomorrow night. Main bout.
He's a winner, so it'll be short money.
Bet all you can. Bet your shirt. lt'd pay more if he lost. You sure he isn't gonna lay down and die?
On my word, Mike.
Now that's the kind of a bet I like.
Thanks a lot.
What I really came over for was to find out what you know about a kid that used to fight under the name of Lee Kawolsky.
- What about him?
- Come on, don't give me that.
- You know just about everybody.
- About him I don't know.
He was killed in an accident, but it wasn't really an accident.
Two fellas, they came in here.
Charlie Max and Sugar Smallhouse.
They asked, if anybody asked questions about Lee Kawolsky, what do I know?
I looked at their faces.
You know what I said?
I said ''I don't know anything.''
They said to keep that in mind and they'd make it worth my while.
You'd sell the gold out of your mother's teeth.
- How much did they give you? I'll top it.
- You can't top this.
They said they'd let me breathe.
Hello. Pat Murphy, please.
Tell him Mike Hammer's calling.
Hello, Pat.
What do you know about a pair named
Charlie Max and Sugar Smallhouse?
Never mind what I know. All you have to tell me is whose whistle they jump to.
Carl Evello?
- Yeah... Yeah...
- (racetrack fanfare over radio)
Go ahead. I can hear you.
Just a minute, I'll ask Mr Evello.
- What do you wanna do, Carl?
- We'll take half his action.
Carl says we'll take half. They out for the fifth yet? We can get down a bet, huh?
- Would you give me a light, Sugar?
- Don't bother me.
Aw, come on, Sugar.
Give us a thousand on Big Boy, on the nose.
Aren't you gonna light my cigarette, Sugar?
Blow! Dames are worse than flies.
You playing cards, Charlie, or ain't you?
(racing commentary from poolside)
Hello.
Well, this is a coincidence.
- How do you do, ma'am?
- How do I do? Crazy.
Don't be afraid. I won't bite.
You don't taste like anybody I know.
But it's all right. In fact, it's wonderful.
Come on, crazy.
- Seconds?
- OK.
Sure we haven't met before?
Never.
Who are you?
Who am I? Who are you?
I'm Friday. I'd have been named Tuesday if I'd been born on Tuesday.
I'm Carl's sister. Half-sister.
Same mother, different father.
You know, you're not like the others.
Carl's friends, I mean.
Maybe because I'm not his friend.
Wonderful. Then you can be my friend.
All mine, nothing to do with Carl.
(radio) There they go!
They come away from the gate...
(Friday) They're big, hairy and ugly.
They chew long black cigars and they talk loud.
I don't like them.
But I like you.
Then why don't you invite me into the house?
- Will you come into my house?
- Why not?
What's that horse doin', walkin'?
He ain't even in on the call.
Gin.
Gin? Gin?!
He don't pay no attention and he kills me with his gin!
Here's to... friendship.
Friendship.
- I have lots of friends.
- I'll bet you have.
I'm not hard to get along with.
Really I'm not.
I can be a very... good friend.
Will you be my friend?
What do I have to do?
If you wanna be a... close friend, ask me something.
And no matter what it is, the answer is yes, huh?
Maybe.
Let's see how good you are at spelling.
Can you spell ''no''?
N-o spells no.
That's a good girl.
Now you practise saying that.
Because one of the best ways to be friendly is to know when to say no.
Your brother wouldn't be wearing blue suede shoes by any chance?
Hardly. He's more the black moccasin type.
You know, it's a hot day and I'm feeling kind of warm.
Why don't you invite me for a dip?
Sure. Just get all wet.
(racing commentary on radio)
Hey, look who's here.
You'll find a suit inside. I'll wait.
- Are you kidding?
- Why not?
Charlie, Sug.
Send him into the house.
How do I know what he knows?
All I know is he's snooping around.
- (door opens)
- All right, I'll be polite.
- (Mike) Mr Evello?
- In here.
I'll call you back.
Hello, Mr Hammer.
You handle yourself pretty well.
I figure it's good to speak a lot of languages.
Any country you go to, you can take care of yourself.
- Maybe you can speak my language, eh?
- Like putting torpedoes in gifts?
(Evello chuckles)
I'll admit that was a little crude.
We keep underestimating you.
I don't know what's on your mind.
What do you want, Mr Hammer?
Yesterday I was looking for a thread.
Today, a piece of string.
And tomorrow, who knows? You don't even know what you're looking for.
- Tell me.
- Trouble. That's what you're looking for.
You're lucky. That drop off the cliff didn't kill you, the torpedo should have.
Or Sugar. What'd you do to him, anyway?
You scared Charlie half to death.
Look, Mike. I like you.
I like the way you handle yourself.
You seem reasonable.
Why don't we make a deal?
What's it worth to you to turn your considerable talents back to the gutter?
- Name a price.
- And you'll try it on for size, huh?
You're cute. You oughta know better than anyone what it's worth.
I set my fee according to the case.
This one keeps getting higher.
lt does, huh?
Maybe you'd like to make an exploratory offer just to get the ball rolling.
OK, Mr Hammer. lt's been nice talking to you. Drop round again sometime.
Maybe then I'll have a better notion of my fee.
lt's too late to set a fee, Mr Hammer.
Suddenly it's too late.
(faint opera music )
I've been out here three times and this dame keeps brushin' me off.
I gotta make a living, too. Send somebody else. How much can a guy take?
I'm not comin' out again. Get somebody else. There are other guys around here.
(opera music gets louder)
A guy could get a heart attack walkin' up here.
Who invited you?
- Carmen Trivago. What room?
- Follow your ear.
Thank you.
(man singing along to ''Martha'' by Flotow, sung by Caruso)
He love her. She's dead.
He sings, il maestro.
Magnifico. Che bella voce. Bello, bello.
Bravo! Bravissimo!
- Who are you?
- You're a friend of Nicholas Raymondo.
Raymondo?
- That's right. Raymondo.
- I know nothing. Nothing!
- Quite a stack of records you got here.
- Oh, yes.
- Caruso's Pagliacci.
- ll maestro.
- That's a collector's item.
- Yeah.
Please, what you wanted to know? I will tell you.
Raymondo is my friend.
Very sad friend. Always he's sad.
He's - how you call? - engineer scientist.
Very smart. Very bright. Very sad.
He was murdered. Why?
I don't know. I don't know.
- What was he so sad about?
- For the way the world is, he is very sad.
He says to me...
''I'm very intelligent, Trivago, but I'm very stupid.''
''I'm very rich, I'm very poor.''
''I have a little secret, and it's very important. And it's not important at all.''
- What did he mean by that?
- When I ask him, he says it's a riddle without an answer.
I think he's making a joke.
But when he's dead, I know it's not a joke.
Somewhere... somewhere he has a secret.
- How do you know that?
- They come, the ones that kill him.
They want something small. Something he can hide where they don't find.
And they ask ''Where is it?!''
But I don't know. I don't know!
(turns on ''Martha'' record) lt's a lovely record.
(knocks)
Mike?
They came last night, right after you left.
I heard them. I hid in the basement.
- They think you know something.
- But I don't.
- Tell them that.
- I've got to get out of here.
They found you once.
They'll find you again.
I'm going down to my car.
When you hear the horn, come running.
(horn)
(singing)
(laughing)
Mikey!
- Hi, Mikey.
- What happened?
I went to Culver City. They know nothing.
But they wanted to know why I asked.
- What did you tell them?
- Nothing.
Uh... Look, I've got to drop something off, but I'll be back. We'll go together.
(whistling cheerfully)
(Nick hums)
Oh, hi. Anything I can do for you, mister? I'm busy right now...
What are you doin' there?
(screams)
Use anything in the closet until we can get you some clothes. Take the bedroom.
- Where will you sleep?
- I'll take the couch.
If you want coffee, the kitchen's...
Thank you, Mike.
Thank you. Thank you.
OK, you've made your point.
You're welcome.
Mike?
Mike!
Why did you come back tonight?
In your absence, there have been no calls.
You changed your mind. Something changed it for you. What was it?
- You say you don't know a thing.
- lt's true. I don't.
But they think you do or they wouldn't be after you. Maybe that's worth something.
Keep the door chained and don't answer the phone. They won't know you're here.
But if they pay you off, you'll tell them.
Then where will I be?
Mike! You can't do that!
Mike?
Mike!
(whimpering) Nico, Nico...
Oh, Nick...
They kill Nick, Mike.
Somebody, they kill Nick.
(sirens)
(whimpering) No...
No, no, no...
Velda?
Velda?
Hello, Mike.
What is it?
What kind of trouble are you in this time?
Yes. Yes, you are. I can see it.
I'm glad.
I'm always glad when you're in trouble because then you always come to me.
What is it, Mike?
Nick's dead.
Nick?
The jack slipped and the car came down on him.
Is that what really happened?
He was doing a couple of jobs for me.
And he got it. Like all your friends are gonna get it one of these days.
What is it you're after, Mike?
Something Nicholas Raymondo had and the girl knew about.
Something very valuable.
But is it worth Nick's life?
Or Christina's, or Raymondo's, or Kawolsky's?
Or mine?
(Mike) Or Lily Carver's?
Christina's roommate.
She's in my apartment.
They tried to get her last night.
(Velda) ''They.'' A wonderful word.
And who are they?
They are the nameless ones who kill people for the great whatsit.
Does it exist? Who cares?
Everyone everywhere is so involved in a fruitless search - for what?
Why don't you turn her over to Pat? lt's his job to protect her.
If she needs protection.
Or to question her if that's what's needed.
Why are you always trying to make a noise like a cop?
- What were you doing in bed so early?
- I had a few drinks.
I'm trying to sleep off a hangover.
I met your friend Ray Diker over at Toscio's this afternoon.
He pointed out some joker at the bar.
A dealer in abstract art or something.
I went over and just happened to pick him up.
Make your ears stand up?
He dropped a few names.
Wanna hear them?
Carl Evello you know, but...
Dr Soberin. Does that do anything for you?
This joker says there's a new art in the world. This doctor's starting a collection.
What kind of a collection?
I don't know.
He... tried to date me.
With a few drinks and one thing leading to another,
I suppose I could get some more information about the doctor.
Do you want me to date him?
Well?
- Well what?
- Well, what do you think?
I think I'd like to get my hands on whoever killed Nick.
You want to avenge the death of your dear friend.
How touching. How sweet.
How nicely it justifies your quest for the great whatsit.
Why don't you leave, Mike?
Before I change my mind.
Besides, I'm gonna need all the rest I can get
if I'm gonna have any strength to fight off my new-found, my bosom friend.
Mike...
Meet me at the Pigalle.
Two o'clock. Huh?
OK.
# The night is mighty chilly
# And conversation seems pretty silly
# I feel so mean and brought
# I'd rather have the blues than what I've got
# The room is dark and gloomy
# You don't know what you're doing to me
# The web has got me caught
# I'd rather have the blues than what I've got
(singing continues)
Say, man, you sure look beat.
You look real lean, real wasted.
You don't look like you're with it.
Give me a double bourbon, and leave the bottle.
- Pour one for yourself.
- Sure. Any time.
Who we drinkin' to?
- Nick.
- Nick.
Va-va-voom. Pretty pow!
# Looks very frightening
# The rain begins, and then comes...
Mike. Mike!
Mike, come on.
A fella just come in.
Said they got your girl.
They got Velda. Told me to tell you.
- Where is he?
- I don't know. He cut out. He blew.
I'm sorry, Mike.
Thanks, kid.
- Jaguar not good enough for you, huh?
- The ashtrays were all full.
That girl I was with gave you a letter.
Know who it was addressed to?
Yeah. I just wanted to know who the lucky guy was. lt was some joker named Mike.
Mike?
lnteresting letter, huh?
Good evening, Mr Hammer.
We took a gander at it.
Couldn't quite make it out.
Won't be no trouble this time, Mr Hammer.
I've been taking lessons.
I was out for two hours after you flipped me. Couldn't move a muscle.
- Give him a hand, Charlie.
- Yeah, sure.
Lean on me if you like, huh? Feel OK?
- Well, here we are, Mr Hammer.
- Watch your step.
For a couple of cannons, you guys sure are polite.
We're here on this earth such a brief span, we might as well be.
Well, you are awake.
Lie still. Why torment yourself?
Who do you see?
Someone you do not know.
A stranger.
What is it we are seeking?
Diamonds? Rubies? Gold?
Perhaps narcotics.
How civilised this earth used to be.
But as the world becomes more primitive, its treasures become more fabulous.
Perhaps sentiment will succeed where greed failed.
You will die, Mr Hammer.
But your friend, you can save her.
Yes, you can.
The young lady you picked up on the highway, she wrote you a letter.
In it were two words: ''Remember me.''
She asks you to remember.
What is it you must remember?
Do not be alarmed, Mr Hammer. lt is only a harmless drug.
Sodium Pentothal. The truth serum.
Under its influence, you will sleep.
And while you sleep, your subconscious will provide the answer, and you will cry out what it is that you must remember.
Pleasant dreams, Mr Hammer.
(mumbling)
(mumbling)
''Remember me.'' What did she mean?
(Mike moans) No...
No...
No!
''Remember me.'' What did she mean?
(mumbling)
(Mike still mumbling)
Any luck?
(boxing commentary on radio next door)
..six, seven, eight...
And Bender is up once more.
The referee is holding McCoy away.
Here comes McCoy once again.
McCoy senses this may be the end.
lt's a left hook to Bender's jaw.
That was his third knockdown in the fight, and we're only halfway through.
Bender has been taking a bad beating.
(Mike) Hey.
Hey!
Bender tries frantically to get on his bicycle but McCoy is in full chase.
He has Bender up against the ropes now...
Back among the living, eh?
- I got it figured.
- You have?
- Yeah.
- OK, let's have it.
- Will you let her go?
- Sure. Take my word. Free as a bird.
You want to talk?
I want to whisper.
So whisper.
(boxing commentary continues)
Sug. Sugar!
- Yes, Mr Evello?
- He talked. He's yours.
I believe they brought
Bender along too fast.
He has been unable to cope with McCoy, who is a real tiger tonight, bent on the kill.
McCoy has shown too much experience and punching power for Bender,
who is a comparative novice.
(gasps)
(Evello screams)
..seeking the telltale sign that Bender had had it.
Gilmore thought, while Jim was taking a thorough shellacking,
he still knew where he was and what he was doing.
There's the ten-second buzzer, and the young man is going out again.
- (bell)
- Round ten.
McCoy leads with his left, and is nicely blocked by Bender.
McCoy closes with a left hook.
Bender parries it and they're in a clinch.
Bender pushes McCoy out of it now and jabs with the left.
Bender scores heavily with a right...
(car speeds off)
..Bender has hurt him. McCoy's eyes have a glazed look and Bender is on top of him.
Now it's McCoy on the run and Bender in pursuit. McCoy is in a neutral corner.
Jim Bender is on top...
Carver.
- Carver?
- I'm coming!
- Carver.
- I'm coming. I'm coming!
- Where'd you get those clothes?
- Your friend Miss Wichman brought them.
- When?
- Yesterday.
She brought some perfume, too.
I feel almost human.
Wanna smell?
What is it? What's the matter?
What did she mean, ''Remember me''?
Read this.
''Remember''?
''Remember me when no more, day by day
You tell me of our future that you plann'd;
Only remember me: you'll understand
But if the darkness and corruption leave
A vestige of the thoughts that once we had...''
Read that last part again.
''But if the darkness and corruption leave
A vestige of the thoughts that once we had...''
Mike?
Mike! Don't leave me.
They were at the door last night.
They tried to get in.
They tried to get in.
They?
Better get your coat.
''If the darkness and corruption leave a vestige of the thoughts that once we had.''
But if it's a thought, it's dead because she's dead. lt's got to be a thing.
Something small, something she could hide.
But where would she hide it?
She didn't have time at the gas station.
She swallowed it.
And if she swallowed it, you've got it.
Close the door, please.
What is it?
No, that's all you get.
- I paid you for it. Now hand it over.
- I didn't say I'd give it to you.
- In fact, I don't recall saying anything.
- I want it. Hand it over.
I performed an autopsy on that young lady, and I found a key.
But whatever it is that's locked away, I don't want it.
You have to find a fence and split the take.
That's too much trouble.
All I want is the cash, right here in my hand.
So if you want this key... pay.
No more.
Suit yourself.
(screams)
(surgeon whimpers)
HAC.
HAC.
You wait here. I'll be right out.
- May I help you, sir?
- This key, what's it for?
- Are you a member, sir?
- No. Just tell me about the key.
Pardon me, sir. If you're not a member...
My dear sir...!
- Now tell me about the key!
- lt's a locker key.
Whose?
Just a minute, sir.
- lt's...
- Well? Whose? lt's... Nicholas Raymondo.
Ten-year membership.
- Take me to it.
- Yes, sir.
This is it.
- lt's hot.
- Hot, sir?
Pardon me, sir. What is it?
I don't know, but keep away.
Don't let anybody near.
Yes, sir.
Carver?
Carver!
Yeah.
Yeah, but check that bar he goes to.
Check his girl's apartment in case he comes around.
- (door opens)
- Just a minute. lt's OK. He just came in.
- Where's the key?
- What key?
- That you took from Doc Kennedy.
- I don't know.
- The key is very important. Hand it over.
- Is it as important as Velda?
If you hadn't sent her out to do your dirty work, she'd be OK. Now give me the key.
- Will you make a deal for her?
- Please, the key.
Sure, you'll make a deal for her.
Like you did for Christina.
You held her under custody in a hospital and you let her get away and get killed.
The way Raymondo and Kawolsky were killed. And Nick. And maybe Carver, too.
- Carver?
- Yeah. Surprised?
What kind of an investigation are you running, anyway?
Lily Carver, Christina Bailey's roommate.
We fished Carver's body out of the harbour over a week ago.
You're so bright, working on your own, you penny-ante gumshoe.
You thought you saw something big and you tried to horn in.
What about this dame who's passing herself off as Carver?
How did you get that?
Now listen, Mike.
Listen carefully.
I'm going to pronounce a few words.
They're harmless words.
Just a bunch of letters scrambled together.
But their meaning is very important.
Try to understand what they mean.
Manhattan Project. Los Alamos. Trinity.
Let's go.
- What about Velda?
- What about her?
- What about him?
- Let him go to hell.
Let the big slob sit there and think about his girl, what's likely to happen to her.
I didn't know.
You didn't know.
Do you think you'd have done any different if you had known?
(dials phone)
(phone ringing)
Diker?
Ray Diker!
The man you pointed out to Velda, what's his name? What's his name?!
William Mist! His name is William Mist!
(knocking on door)
(gagging and coughing)
Where's Velda?
Where is she? Where is she?
Where is she? Where is she?
Where is she? Where is she?
Where is she?
(snoring)
(# classical music )
(Velda's voice) He pointed out some joker at the bar.
A dealer in abstract art or something.
I went over and just happened to pick him up.
He dropped a few names.
Does that make your ears stand up?
Wanna hear them?
Dr Soberin. Does that do anything for you?
(louder) Dr Soberin.
Does that do anything for you?
Dr Soberin... Dr Soberin... Dr Soberin...
- Dr Soberin's office.
- Dr Soberin, please.
I'm sorry. Dr Soberin isn't available at present.
He's referring all his calls to this answering service.
- Why not call another doctor?
- I need him. lt's important.
I can't help you. He might be at his beach cottage, but there's no phone.
There is something sad and melancholy about trips.
I always hate to go away.
But one has to find some new place, or it would be impossible to be sad and melancholy again.
(Lily) What's in the box?
- What's in the box?
- Curiosity killed a cat,
and it certainly would have you if you'd opened it.
- You did well to call me when you did.
- Yes, I know. But what's in it?
You have been misnamed, Gabrielle.
You should have been called Pandora.
She was curious about a box and opened it and let loose all the evil in the world.
Never mind about the evil. What's in it?
Did you ever hear of Lot's wife?
- No.
- No.
She was told not to look back.
But she disobeyed and she was changed into a pillar of salt.
I just want to know what it is.
Would you believe me if I told you?
Would you be satisfied?
Maybe.
The head of the Medusa.
That's what's in the box.
And whoever looks on her will be changed not into stone, but into brimstone and ashes.
But you wouldn't believe me. You'd have to see for yourself, wouldn't you?
Where are we going?
Where I am going it is not possible for you to go.
I had no illusion about deceiving you.
You have the feline perceptions that all women have.
Would you mind moving?
You're sitting on my coat.
Whatever is in that box, it must be very precious. So many people have died for it.
Yes, it is very precious.
I want half.
I agree with you.
You should have at least half.
You deserve it, for all the creature comforts you've given me.
But unfortunately the object in this box cannot be divided.
Then I'll take it all.
- If you don't mind.
- (gunshot)
Gabrielle!
Listen to me... as if I were Cerberus... barking with all his heads at the gates of Hell.
I will tell you where to take it.
But don't... don't open... the box.
- Hello, Mike.
- Where's Velda?
Come in.
Come in.
Kiss me, Mike. I want you to kiss me.
Kiss me.
The liar's kiss that says ''I love you'' but means something else.
You're good at giving such kisses.
Kiss me.
(powerful hiss)
(screaming)
(screaming)
Velda! Velda!
Velda! Velda!
- Velda!
- Mike!
(rattles door)
- Mike!
- Velda!
- Velda!
- Mike!
Mike!
(powerful hiss)
It has been written... since the beginning of time... even onto these ancient stones... that evil, supernatural creatures exist... in a world of darkness.
And it is also said... man, using the magic power... of the ancient runic symbols... can call forth these powers of darkness... the demons of hell.
- I must see Dr. Karswell at once.
- Who shall I say is calling?
Professor Harrington.
Tell him it's most urgent.
I'm afraid Mr. Karswell is not at home, sir.
I know he's here. Tell him
I won't leave until he does see me.
- I'm very sorry, sir.
- Well, go back and say--
- Karswell.
- That's all right, Bates.
Please, come in.
This way.
- Good evening.
- Good evening.
Mother--
Well, I'll go and see about some tea.
That won't be necessary.
We shall only be a minute.
Call it off, Karswell.
Stop this thing you've started... and I'll admit publicly I was totally wrong and that you were totally right.
It's very gratifying to hear that, but some things... are more easily started than stopped.
But I've heard it.
I've seen it. I know it's real!
You involved me in a public scandal.
I protested.
You said, ''Do your worst,'' and that's precisely what I did.
Please, Karswell.
I'll stop this investigation.
When Holden arrives,
I'll tell him I've made a mistake.
I'll send a statement to the newspapers.
No more newspapers. All I ask for is privacy for myself and my followers.
- Well, I promise.
- All right. That's good enough.
Then you'll stop this?
You've still got that parchment
I gave you?
The runic symbols?
No, they burned. I couldn't stop it.
I see. Well, I think perhaps you'd better go home.
- Then you will help me?
- I'll do all that I can.
- Karswell, if you only knew.
- I do know.
Thank you.
- Good night, Mrs. Karswell.
- Good night.
Thank you again.
Good-bye, Professor.
Excuse me.
I can't get out.
- Sorry.
- Good.
Here they come.
Dr. Holden?
I'm Lloyd Williamson.
- Professor Harrington's personal aide.
- How are you?
I'm so glad I'd be able to meet you here, sir.
The professor had planned to meet you here himself, but he--
- Well--
- Dr. Holden?
We're the press, sir.
Could you spare a few minutes?
- What makes me news?
- Ghosts.
What exactly is the function of this convention you're attending?
Investigation of international reports on paranormal psychology.
''Para'' what psychology?
Just say mind-reading, fortune-telling, spirits and zombies.
Operator, I'm still waiting for my number.
I'm sorry. The number you requested is reported out of order.
Could you check it, then?
It's to Professor Harrington's house.
That is the correct number, but
I'm sorry. The line is out of order.
Oh. Thank you.
Sorry to keep you waiting,
Williamson.
You were saying
Professor Harrington couldn't come.
I'm afraid I have some terrible news for you.
Professor Harrington was found dead this morning.
Found dead?
Sorry to disturb you, but there's so much to do and so little time.
I'll be right out.
The police say that
Professor Harrington was electrocuted.
Somehow, his car ran into a power line outside his house.
It was a terrible accident.
He must've died instantly.
- The services will be held tomorrow.
- I'll be there.
This is Mark O'Brien. He's been working with Professor Harrington.
- He'll continue to do so with you.
- Fine.
You'll have to forgive me.
I had a little sleep to catch up on.
- Of course.
- Sit down. I won't be very long.
- What is this?
- Part of O'Brien's research... which is tied up with the Karswell Devil Cult investigation.
I see.
Let me get some clothes on.
I wrote Professor Harrington recently that if he wanted to find the key... to Karswell's phony supernatural power, all he had to do... was check the psychological makeup of some of his followers.
I know, but we ran into difficulty.
The one cult member we persuaded to speak up-- a farmer named Rand Hobart-- was arrested several weeks ago as an alleged murderer.
He can still be useful.
I'm afraid not.
His mind is in total collapse.
He's in a state of catatonic shock and in a home for the criminally insane.
Why do you say ''alleged murderer''?
That's just my personal view.
A short while ago at the asylum,
I succeeded in rousing Hobart.
Under hypnosis, he produced this drawing.
It's crude, but remarkably similar to these copies... of old woodcuts and medieval drawings... of a fire demon invoked by witchcraft to destroy an enemy.
You mean you think that thing committed the murder?
I thought the purpose of our convention was to disprove that type of thinking.
- Yes, but Mark says--
- I'll speak for myself, Llyod.
I'm a scientist also, Dr. Holden.
I know the value of the cold light of reason.
But I also know the deep shadows that light can cast.
The shadows that can blind men to truth.
What truth? Myths.
Demonology and witchcraft have been discredited... since the Middle Ages.
I wrote a book about it.
That's why I'm here.
Then explain how an uneducated farmer like Hobart... could know anything about this creature... whose legend has persisted through civilization after civilization.
Babylonian, Baal, Egyptian...
Sethtyphon, Persian, Asmodeus...
Hebraich, Moloch--
Come in.
Good evening. KT Kumar, Bombay, apologizes for being late.
That's quite all right, Kumar.
We're just about to begin.
- This is Dr. Holden.
- How do you do?
Dr. Holden.
I'm very pleased to meet you.
Your work on hypnotism is a great favorite of mine.
Thank you. Now, we were just talking about devils and demons.
What are your views on the subject?
I believe in them.
Absolutely.
You'll find the library straight through, sir.
I'm sorry, sir, but the last volume you asked for--
The True Discoveries of the Witches and Demons-- is not available.
What does ''not available'' mean?
It should be in our restricted section.
The only known existing copy... is over 400 years old, you know.
Yes, I know.
It seems to be missing.
Most peculiar.
I'm having it checked.
It was mentioned in these research notes.
Never mind. I can probably find what I want in these.
I hope so, sir.
I'll do my best to trace it.
Excuse me, sir.
I couldn't help overhearing your conversation with the librarian.
You're interested in seeing The True
Discoveries of Witches and Demons.
- Is that it?
- Yes.
I have a copy I'll gladly put at your disposal.
Then the British Museum didn't have the only copy.
Apparently not, Dr. Holden.
I have what is perhaps the finest library in the world... on witchcraft and the black arts.
- You know my name.
- Oh, yes.
And you know mine.
I'm Julian Karswell.
It's rather difficult to talk here.
Why not come out to my place in the country? The book's there.
If I don't find what I want,
I might take you up on that.
Delighted.
Just one thing.
Let's understand each other.
My investigation of you and your cult... won't be stopped.
But if I could make my point,
I could persuade you.
I'm not open to persuasion.
But a scientist should have an open mind.
That's what investigations are for.
Well... in any event, here's my card.
Lufford Hall.
It's near Wargrave.
I'll be seeing you soon, I'm sure.
Excuse me.
How clumsy.
I'm so, so sorry.
Here are your papers, sir.
- Thank you.
- Good-bye.
Don't leave it too long.
Can I help you, sir?
Did you see that man who was just here?
I can't say that I did.
- What do you make of this?
- It's a visiting card.
No, I mean the handwriting on it.
- No handwriting.
- Yes, there is.
Forget it.
Nice of you to drop in, Kumar.
Good evening, Holden.
Why, Mr. Holden.
Are you ill?
- I'm all right. Hello, Mark.
- I phoned you earlier.
The authorities have been difficult about cooperating on Hobart.
We need the family to sign a release.
I have it here.
If it's gonna be that much trouble, forget it.
His memory patterns are probably worthless anyway.
Besides, I've met this Karswell.
- He's just a harmless faker.
- You are a very skeptical man.
That's what Karswell said.
- Care for a nightcap?
- I wouldn't mind.
Haven't you gentlemen heard that alcohol is the devil's brew?
And interested as I am in the devil,
I never indulge, thank you.
O'Brien, don't you think that...
O'Brien, don't you think that... skepticism is the scientific attitude?
Oh, sometimes.
All good scientists are from Missouri.
In other words, they should continually be saying, ''Show me.''
- And if you are shown?
- Then I'll look twice.
- Like water?
- No, thank you.
The whole question of this demon monster... that you think shocked Hobart out of his mind... is a perfect example of auto-suggestion and mass hysteria.
Just the same as flying saucers.
Someone imagines that they see moving lights in the sky.
And the next thing, a thousand hysterical witnesses... turn up all over the world swearing that Martians are attacking us.
And now, this nonsense.
It even affects serious men like yourselves.
Sometimes, even me.
But logic-- the reality of the seeable and the touchable-- that's what convinces me finally.
Certainly not rumor or intuition or funny feelings.
Here's how.
I wouldn't dream of arguing with you.
You say, ''Show me.''
I say, ''Look for yourself.''
You know, the devil has something here.
Very pleasant.
He's most dangerous when he's being pleasant.
Look, Mark,
I don't want to be arbitrary... about this Hobart business, if you're so set on it.
- Let me think it over, will you?
- We haven't much time.
- This is the release form.
- Thank you.
I wonder... if either of you could recognize this tune.
It goes something like this.
And then it goes--
Sounds like a distortion of an Irish folk tune.
About the devil, I believe.
Present devils excepted, of course.
A most odd coincidence.
For in Northern India there is a similar tune... which is also part of an enchantment spell.
Well, that takes care of that.
I guess I must have heard it somewhere.
It kept running through my mind.
Tell me, what have you got in your program for the convention tomorrow?
Only a few sessions on extrasensory perception.
The timetable is over there on the desk.
I'd like to watch you work.
Do you mind?
Not at all.
Be glad to have you.
Holden, you are not leaving us after the 28th, are you?
No. Why did you ask that?
Well, it's just that all the pages after the 28th are torn out.
I can't find anything on this card.
- Nothing at all?
- No.
I could try some absorption tests, but that would take time.
- How much time?
- Tonight?
Fine. Call me at my hotel when it's finished.
- Aren't you--
- Yes, on the plane.
- Did you know the professor?
- Did you?
Yes, I worked with him.
I'm John Holden.
Then I must talk to you.
It's very important.
I'm Joanna Harrington.
Professor Harrington was my uncle.
- My deepest sympathies.
- Thank you.
- When can we meet?
- Tonight?
- Call me at my hotel.
- All right.
- 41 2. Down to the left, miss.
- Thank you.
- Well, come in.
- Thanks.
So you really are Dr. Holden?
All scientists don't wear thick glasses.
I apologize for bothering you on the plane.
What was all that writing about anyway?
Letters to my pupils about my trip to America.
I'm a kindergarten teacher.
I'm sorry it ended so tragically for you.
- Thank you.
- Sit down, won't you?
- Would you like a drink?
- No, thanks.
You don't mind if I have one, do you?
I need it.
It's cold tonight, isn't it?
No, it's hot.
Quite hot.
Do you think so?
I heard you're continuing my uncle's project.
And?
I believe you're in danger.
I found my uncle's diary.
It's all in here.
- You make it sound very menacing.
- It is.
I think it had something to do with my uncle's death.
Something horrible happened to him.
Something unexplainably horrible.
- I'd like to read it to you.
- Go ahead.
''Met Karswell at Albert Hall concert.''
He puts three exclamation marks after that sentence.
Karswell can be a pretty startling character.
- You've met him?
- This morning.
Listen to this.
''Karswell most pleasant.
Lost my program during concert, and Karswell gave me his.
A nice gesture, since I save them.''
That doesn't sound particularly menacing.
Wait.
''Today I found the parchment... in the concert program
Karswell gave me.
It had runic symbols drawn on it.''
That's not mysterious.
Runic symbols are the oldest form of an alphabet.
They're found carved on ancient stones, like hieroglyphics.
They're supposed to have magic powers.
They don't.
''The parchment acted as if it were alive.
It pulled from my hand and flew into the fire and burned.
I think I can guess what Karswell has done to me.
I'm under some kind of witch's spell.
My mind is in the balance.
Must speak to Holden about this.''
Unfortunately, you came too late.
What you're trying to tell me is... your uncle was killed by witchcraft.
As a doctor,
I can assure you you're wrong.
Please don't treat me like a mental patient who has to be humored.
I also majored in psychology.
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean--
- You could learn a lot from children.
They believe in things in the dark until we tell them it's not so.
Maybe we've been fooling them.
Good night, Dr. Holden.
I'm really quite flattered you've taken such an interest in my welfare.
Don't be. If I hadn't been away, my uncle might still be alive.
- It was an accident.
- I don't believe that.
I loved my uncle very much, and I want to know exactly what happened to him.
You don't seem to share my view.
Good night.
Wait just a minute.
I've tested this card through and through.
There's been no chemical used on it.
Are you sure? Couldn't it have rubbed off in my pocket?
Maybe, but some of it certainly would have been absorbed into the card... and my absorption tests would have shown it.
This card is 1 00% clean.
I guarantee it.
I see.
Well, thank you.
How would you like to show me the way to Lufford Hall... and the friendly
Mr. Karswell tomorrow?
- Then you think--
- Don't jump to conclusions.
I just wanna borrow a book from him and discuss a chemistry problem.
- Are you sure this is Karswell's place?
- That's what it said back there.
I don't know what his racket is, but it pays very well.
Sounds like a human sacrifice.
Well, you remember the magic word, of course.
- Yeah!
- Now!
It's magic.
Just a tame magician.
So that was it.
That was what?
The answer to my chemistry problem.
Why don't--
Right, children. Now, just be good for a few minutes.
I shall be back.
- Holden. Delighted to see you.
- I hope we're not intruding.
Not at all.Just my annual Halloween party for the village children.
I'll come right up.
- He's just a nice old guy.
- Perhaps he's Santa Claus in disguise.
I didn't recognize you.
I used to earn my living like this years ago.
You see before you
Dr. Bobo the Magnificent.
Excuse me.
This is Miss Joanna Harrington.
- Miss, uh, not by any chance--
- Yes. He was my uncle.
I was very sorry to hear of his accident.
He was a man of great principle.
Mother?
I'd like you to meet my mother.
You must try her homemade ice cream.
She's very proud of it.
- May I introduce Dr. Holden.
- How do you do?
And Miss Joanna Harrington.
Miss Harrington is a niece of Henry Harrington's.
Dr. Holden's going to borrow a book from my library.
- I've asked them to stay.
- How nice. Do you like ice cream?
- Yes, I love it.
- Come with me. I'll give you a treat.
- Would you like to try some?
- Not right now, thank you.
Say, this is quite a place you have here.
Yes, yes.
Let me show you around.
Snakes and Ladders. An English game.
You wouldn't know it.
You see, if you land at the foot of the ladder, you climb up to the top.
But if you land on the head of a snake, you slide all the way down again.
Funny thing.
I always preferred sliding down the snakes to climbing up the ladders.
You're a doctor of psychology.
You ought to know the answer to that.
Maybe you're a good loser.
I'm not, you know.
Not a bit.
Just how much do you know about this book that you're after?
Not very much. Only that Professor
Harrington referred to it in his notes.
A remarkable work. The few men that really understood it... learned many strange and terrifying secrets.
Only a few?
Is it that hard to understand?
I spent my life trying to decipher it.
The ancient sorcerers who wrote it knew their information... was far too valuable to entrust to any known language.
I didn't realize what I was asking for.
You don't believe in witchcraft?
Do you?
Do I believe in witchcraft?
What kind of witchcraft?
The legendary witch that rides on the imaginary broom?
The hex that tortures the thoughts of the victim?
The pin stuck in the image that wastes away the mind and body?
Also imaginary.
But where does imagination end and reality begin?
What is this twilight-- this half-world of the mind that you profess to know so much about?
How can we differentiate between the powers of darkness... and the powers of the mind?
- This is a stick-up!
- How terrifying.
What do I see here?
Yes, some chocolate, I do believe.
And there as well.
Here we are.
Gosh! Chocolate!
Wonderful, aren't they?
If only we grown-ups... could preserve their capacity for simple joys and simple beliefs.
I see you practice white magic as well as black.
Oh, yes.
I don't think it would be too amusing for the youngsters... if I conjured up a demon from hell for them.
Or for myself, for that matter.
As we're not protected by the magic circle, we'd both be torn to shreds.
And you'd spoil the party.
You're so right.
But how to prove my point.
There. It's done.
What is?
A magician doesn't like to expose his magic, black or white.
- Where are the others?
- They probably went 'round by the back.
I didn't know you had cyclones in England.
We don't.
- You probably could use a drink.
- The perfect host.
This way.
I'm sorry. I miscalculated.
The wind's stronger than I expected.
Much too much.
You're talking in riddles.
To prove my point.
A medieval witch's specialty-- a wind storm.
Take my professional advice and stick to rabbits and puppy dogs.
You think I'm mad?
Unfortunately, you won't be able... to explain away your death on the 28th of this month so easily... with my prediction of it at this moment.
You're really serious, aren't you?
You will die as I said... at 1 0:00 on the 28th of this month.
Your time allowed is just three days from now.
''My time allowed.''
Oh, yes, your trick with the card.
Very good too.
I'm sorry you remain so skeptical.
But as the time gets closer, mental disintegration will set in.
First, weakness and unsureness.
And then horror, as the fear of what is behind you grips your heart.
Because it's there, Dr. Holden.
It's there!
It has been from the moment we met in the museum.
You actually believe this nonsense.
I asked you to drop this ridiculous investigation.
Perhaps you will before it's too late.
Well, it's nice to know that
I do have a way out, Mr. Karswell.
The choice is yours.
I hope we don't run out of candles before the power lines are repaired.
Don't you think eating by candlelight is romantic?
Yes, but not on a night like this.
Shall we have some brandy in the living room?
I could use something to warm me up.
Don't say it.
I know you think it's hot in here.
No. As a matter of fact, it's rather chilly.
Do you know The Ancient Mariner?
Vaguely. I read it in school.
I found a copy of it in my uncle's desk.
He underlined one part.
''Like one that on a lonesome road doth walk in fear and dread... because he knows a frightful fiend... doth close behind him tread.''
I hope you don't read poems like that to your kindergarten class.
When it's important that a child learn something...
I use the most direct means available.
I get it, teach.
He scribbled a note on the next page.
I never had a kindergarten teacher as pretty as you are.
- I'm serious.
- So am I.
You wouldn't deny a dying man a last request, would you?
You'll listen whether you like it or not. You haven't much time left.
''Today I found all the pages of my desk calendar... torn out after October the 22nd.''
I know why.
He died on the 22nd.
John, what's the matter?
The same thing happened to my desk calendar, after the 28th.
And I know why.
You put the two together, and they add up to a very obvious trick.
You see, when a tribal witch doctor puts a hex on his victim... he always lets the victim know well beforehand.
Let me see your uncle's diary.
In case it would make you feel better... a parchment has to be passed... and the person has to take it without knowing.
My mother taught me never to take anything from strangers.
- I still don't.
- Then what killed my uncle?
An accident with a falling power line killed him.
Then he should only have been burned.
His body was mutilated horribly.
The police said it could've been an animal.
The only thing they didn't say was what kind of animal.
What do you expect me to do?
Nobody's free from fear.
I have an imagination like anyone else.
It's easy to see a demon in every dark corner.
But I refuse to let this thing take possession of my good senses.
If this world is ruled by demons and monsters, we may as well give up now.
Nobody said we were ruled by them.
You just want me to give in to
Karswell's carefully calculated threats.
That's exactly what he wants me to do.
Because he knows he can't stand up to a real investigation.
If he's so all-powerful, what's he so afraid of?
I wish I knew.
Are you sure Karswell never passed anything or gave you anything... on which the runes could have been written?
- What if he did?
- Did he?
Well, he could have at the museum when my notes fell to the floor.
As a matter of fact, he mentioned the museum the other day.
Yes?
Well, he picked up the papers and handed 'em back to me.
- Where are they now?
- At my hotel, I suppose.
No.
They're in my briefcase.
I have it here.
He did give you the parchment.
- It's trying to escape!
- It's just the wind.
But it is trying to escape into the fire!
It's the draft from the chimney.
What made them stop?
I don't know.
That's it, sir.
Number 44.
Thank you.
Over here,John.
I'm sorry I'm late. I just got back to the hotel and found your message.
It's only a minute or two.
I wanted to wait and go in with you.
- What is this all about?
- I'm not sure I know.
That's why I asked you to come here.
I didn't want to have to explain.
I promised Mrs. Karswell
I'd bring you here.
- Mrs. Karswell?
-John, she wants to help you.
I thought we might take a chance.
I mean, I thought... at least we might learn something.
After this afternoon, I must confess there are a few things I don't know.
I'm so glad you've come, both of you.
Mr. Meek has just telephoned.
He's on his way.
- May I ask who Mr. Meek is?
- The gentleman I want you to meet.
And this is Mrs. Meek.
Miss Harrison--
I mean Harrington, and Dr. Holden.
- How do you do?
- Excuse me, please.
Don't you worry. All your problems will be solved. You'll see.
That's very nice.
May I ask how?
- Through tonight's seance.
- Seance?
Yes. Mr. Meek is the most remarkable medium.
I come to him with all my problems.
Here he is now.
John, she's trying to help you.
I said I'd talk to her.
But this nonsense--
- These things are all phony.
- Oh, please.
You'll hurt Mr. Meek's feelings.
- He really is a most wonderful man.
- Well, good evening.
'Tis a good evening too.
A little warm, perhaps.
Mr. Meek, this is Dr. Holden.
So you're the gentleman who was in trouble. Maggie, dear?
Well, life's full of little problems, isn't it?
Let's see. What's yours?
No, perhaps you better not tell me.
The spirits sometimes resent previous knowledge.
Well, let's see if we can clear the air.
Well, let's see if we can clear the air.
Not being part of the circle, you two had better sit by the window.
Well, Maggie, no point in wasting these good people's time.
I must be insane to get involved in a thing like this.
John, please.
Very well, Maggie.
Cherry ripe
Cherry ripe
Ripe, I cry
Full and fair ones
We must all sing.
The spirits like it.
He's going off.
That's really very quick.
He's so helpful, you'll see.
Mrs. Karswell--
Something's here.
Can't you feel it?
That's Crimson Eagle.
He's Mr. Meek's guide.
He's a Red Indian Chief from an obscure part of your country.
Well, a kindly good evening to you, friends.
Good evening, Mr. McGregor.
That's Mr. McGregor.
He always comes through.
He's a friend of ours.
Bonny weather we're having.
It'll do a mickle of good to the flowers and the barley.
Lovely weather, Mr. McGregor.
But I sense we have strangers in our midst.
Two strangers.
But they're very sympathetic.
Will ya ha' them into the circle?
That's really a great honor.
Mr. McGregor's so particular who sits in the circle. Here.
Over here, both of you.
- It's my uncle.
- Don't be foolish.
- Are you there,Joanna?
- Yes.
- These things are all faked.
- But it is my uncle! I know his voice!
Please!
You'll hurt Mr. Meek.
Got to--
Got to tell Holden... he can't fight it.
It's too strong.
He means you must give up the investigation.
- This is crazy.
- Karswell has the key.
He's translated the old book.
The answer is there.
- No!
- Look!
It's in the trees!
It's coming!
The demon!
It's coming! No!
That does it.
Don't turn the light on!
He's in a trance!
- A trance my eye.
- Maggie, I feel sick.
- You're not the only one.
- He's still alive, no thanks to you.
Don't you know that to wake a medium out of a trance is to risk his life?
But it was real!
You must do as he says.
Don't you understand?
Oh, dear.
Mr. Holden!
Don't go, Mr. Holden!
Oh, Mr. Holden, you must listen!
Mr. Meek knew nothing!
Let them go. All right, Mother.
Come along with me.
But I tell you, it did sound like my uncle's voice.
It was Mr. Meek doing voice impersonations.
And your supposed friend,
Mrs. Karswell, staged the whole thing.
She's looking out for her son's interests, not mine.
Tomorrow's the 28th.
That would be a real miracle if Karswell could change time.
What if we did find he really had a translation of that book.
Would that convince you that there is something in all this?
It might help.
Then I'm going to Karswell's house to see if I can find it.
Go ahead.
Aren't you even going to try to stop me?
It would be easier to stop Karswell's demon... than a woman who has her mind made up.
No lights are showing.
If anybody finds you there, the charge will be burglary.
Karswell is away.
His mother told me.
If you find a reception committee waiting for you... will you believe then that
Mrs. Karswell loves her son, not us?
I hope that's what does happen.
Don't you see
I want to be wrong?
There's nothing I'd like better than to find out... that this is all being put on just to scare you off.
Where are you going?
- To see if I can get into the house.
- But it was my idea.
You didn't think for a minute that
I'd let you go in there, did you?
- I'll go with you.
- No, it'll be much easier for me.
I can get next to the house by going through the woods without being seen.
And with you waiting,
I'll hurry back.
- Why did you drop the poker?
- It's red-hot.
It isn't, you know.
My boy, you're as pale as death.
There was something in here.
Nothing to worry you.Just a minor demon I set to protect the room.
Nothing like the real thing when you meet it.
It may have been minor, but it had claws and teeth.
Oh, claws and teeth.
Did you bite the man?
Oh, shame.
I don't keep you as a watch cat.
I left the book in full sight for him.
His name is Greymalkin.
A very fashionable name for English cats in the Middle Ages.
- They were used in witchcraft.
- It was not that cat.
Oh, yes, it was.
You must have awakened him.
You shouldn't have, at the time of the full moon... when cats wander and witches dance.
Oh, yes. They do dance.
I've seen them.
- You really are crazy, aren't you?
- On the contrary. You seem unhinged.
Is breaking into my house to read my scribbles an indication of sanity?
- I was talked into that.
- Ah, Miss Harrington, no doubt... that horribly bright young woman.
- I don't think she'd be flattered.
- At least her head isn't in the sand.
She believes that she can see.
She can.
She believes that she's alive.
She is.
She believes that you'll die tomorrow night. You will.
Julian, I thought I heard--
It's all right, Mother.Just a social visit. Dr. Holden was just leaving.
- Is your car outside?
- Housebreakers don't leave cars.
You have a point there. Give my regards to that intelligent young woman.
If you're thinking of going through the woods, you might find it unpleasant.
I suggest you use the drive.
I'll put on the light for you.
I have one superstition--
I like to go back the way I came.
He's a very obstinate young man.
I told him not to go through the woods.
He just wouldn't listen.
It was dark in the trees... and I saw this smoke.
I know this sounds crazy, but...
I could've sworn the smoke came after me.
And don't forget
Karswell tore out those pages.
I mean, the book must have had the answer.
Why would he have torn them out otherwise?
Quite. One usually has a reason for tearing things out.
And this feeling of being followed.
And Karswell says
Dr. Holden will die tomorrow night.
Of this enchantment thing?
Forget the hex. Let's say something came after me. Take it from there.
We've been through all of this before.
Frankly, I think a bit of sleep is indicated.
It's extraordinary how different a thing can look in the morning.
- But there's so little time!
- If what you say is true.
- But it is! All of it!
- Doctor...
I don't think Scotland Yard can be anything but an interested spectator.
- I see your point.
- You mean, Uncle, you have a victim?
You already have one-- my uncle.
Have we got anything in criminal records to cover phantoms and demons?
- Not that I know of.
- I didn't think so.
You're right. It will seem different in the morning.
But it is morning. It's 3:00 in the morning, to be exact.
If you insist on setting the wheels grinding, will you please wait here?
Spare me a minute, sir.
There's a Dr.John Holden outside, sir.
- The psychology chap?
- That's it, sir.
It's-- It's a bit awkward.
He's--
It seems he's bewitched.
You know, broomsticks and all that.
Thinks he's being followed by something.
Apparently, he's going to die tomorrow night.
- Does he say so?
- Well, not exactly, sir.
There's a young lady with him, a Miss Harrington.
Apparently, her uncle went through the same thing.
Thought he was being followed by something or other.
Thought he was going to die on a certain night at 1 0:00.
Did he?
That's the thing that's got me puzzled, sir. He did.
You look angry.
Maybe that's because I am.
- With me, for bringing you here?
- No. At myself... for not realizing what their attitude was bound to be.
Look,Joanna, let me tell you something about myself.
When I was a kid, I used to walk down the street with the other kids.
When we'd come to a ladder, they'd all walk around it.
I'd walk under it,just to see if anything would happen.
Nothing ever did.
When they'd see a black cat... they'd run the other way to keep it from crossing their path.
But I didn't, and all this ever did for me... was make me wonder why-- why people could get so panicky over absolutely nothing at all.
I've made a career studying it... maybe just to prove one thing-- that I'm not a superstitious sucker like about 90 percent of humanity.
But what did you run from in the woods?
It was a trick gadget that Karswell had rigged up to frighten me away... and I fell for the bait like an idiot.
But he told you himself not to go back through the trees.
That's good psychology.
The same as he used when he had your sweet old Mrs. Karswell... plant the story about his being away.
Don't bother about him.
He thinks I'm crazy anyway.
I'm beginning to think so myself.
Allowing myself to be stampeded like this into a state of hysteria--
I suppose you mean by me.
I didn't say you were doing it deliberately.
But that's what you meant.
Good night, Dr. Holden.
When your partner comes out, tell him it was just a bad Halloween joke.
I want to clear up everything today, even if it means... having the closing session tonight.
- Is that all right with you?
- Fine.
Hobart's been send down today by ambulance under guard.
I want to get back to the States as soon as possible.
I'll get it.
You finish your breakfast.
Yes?
Who's calling?
It's Mrs. Karswell.
Tell her I cut my throat.
Anything. Get rid of her.
She's been calling all night.
Dr. Holden has just left for the day. I'm sorry.
Hmm?
She's hung up.
Karswell's working his mother overtime.
Let's go, shall we?
All of us here know that through the use of hypnotism... we can unlock certain sections of the human mind... that are not accessible to memory.
A great deal of publicity has been given lately...
A great deal of publicity has been given lately... to hypnotized persons who supposedly recall... an existence prior to birth.
In all cases, we must ask ourselves...
''Do hypnotized people always tell the truth?''
The subject of hypnotism brings us to a presentation... of the late Professor Harrington's study and investigation... of people who follow witch cults... and practice devil worship.
We're going to perform an experiment on the platform... with a Mr. Rand Hobart... who, through an experience related to devil worship... has lost all contact with reality.
Professor O'Brien, the platform is yours.
We have here an extraordinary subject.
For a period of time, this man has been as you see him here.
He fails to respond to any normal stimulation.
His experience, whatever it was... which we hope here to discover, has left him... in a state of absolute catatonic immobility.
When I first investigated this case, the problem of how to hypnotize... an unresponsive person was the major one.
Now, the proceedings may be somewhat dramatic, but they are necessary.
The only way of bringing his mind out of the womb of darkness... into which it has retreated to protect itself... is by therapeutic shock-- electrical or chemical.
For our purpose, we are today using pentathol... and later methyl amphetamine.
Hobart, look at this.
Look at this.
You see only this.
You see nothing else.
Only the light.
Only this.
You see only the light.
Look at this.
You see only this.
You see nothing else.
You see only this.
Your eyelids are getting heavy.
Tired.
More and more tired.
You're going to sleep.
Sleep.
Calm, restful sleep.
Rest. Sleep.
Now.
You hear nothing but my voice.
Do you understand, Hobart?
You hear nothing but my voice.
The patient is now in a deep trance and will obey the commands of Dr. Holden.
Methyl amphetamine.
- Do you wish to proceed?
- No, I'll turn him over to you.
- Do you wish to proceed?
- No, I'll turn him over to you.
Hobart, you'll next hear the voice of Prof. O'Brien.
From that point on, it will be his voice and his alone... that you will hear and obey.
Do you understand that?
Yes?
- Do you hear me?
- Yes.
Mine is the only voice you'll hear.
Is that clear?
Yes.
Only you.
Hobart, what is the order of the true believer?
Those of us who believe that... evil is good... and good evil.
And who revealed this to you, Hobart?
Who?
The one who has brought us the wisdom... of the true belief.
-Julian Karswell?
- Yes.
Now, I want you to come forward in time.
It is the night of the demon.
You must.
It is the night of the demon.
No! It's there.
I see it in the trees... the smoke and the fire.
My time allowed is almost over.
Hobart, what do you mean,
''your time allowed''?
He's not in rapport with you.
Want me to turn him over?
- Yes, please.
- Hobart... from now on, the only voice you'll hear is that of Dr. Holden.
Do you understand?
What do you mean by
''your time allowed''?
To prepare for my death.
Why must you die?
I've been chosen.
How will you die?
The parchment was passed to me.
I took it without knowing.
Hobart, open your eyes.
Is this the parchment?
I passed it back to the brother who gave it to me.
It was the only way.
I had to return it to him.
I didn't want to, but it was the only way I could save myself.
To save yourself, you had to give it back to the one who gave it to you?
Yes. Yes.
I had to.
And the demon took him.
Not me! Not me!
You're trying to pass it to me again.
But I won't take it.
I won't!
Let it escape!
Let it escape!
It was born in fire!
Let it die in fire!
Oh, this is terrible.
Really terrible.
Could you get me a car to take me to Lufford Hall?
You can use mine.
But why should you want to go there?
I have something to return to Mr. Karswell. Give me the key.
Certainly.
Dr. Holden. Wait.
- I do not believe he's there.
- How do you know?
Mrs. Karswell told me earlier on the telephone.
Knowing your attitude, I told her you would not be interested. Are you?
- Yes, I am.
- She kept saying all evil must end... but how could it?
- Go on.
- I hardly understood her... but it seems that her son is taking the 8:45 train to Southampton tonight.
- Would you know why?
- The 8:45.
Has the Southampton train come through yet?
- She's in the station now.
- Give me one ticket, please.
Good evening, Dr. Holden.
My boy.
I've been expecting you.
Joanna.
First-stage hypnosis.
Oh,just a convenient way of stopping idle chatter on the train.
She's not harmed.
I'll bring her out of it.
Now, wake.
There's a friend here.
Talk to him.
-John.
- This is abduction, you know.
Oh, dear me, no, no, no.
She came quite willingly.
You came willingly, didn't you?
You remember.
We discussed it... oh, at great length.
John, he's frightened-- terrified of you.
I thought it was supposed to be the other way around.
- He's trying to run away from you.
- You see why I let her sleep?
This idle chatter.
Karswell, I know now... that you were right and I was wrong.
Really?
But there is a way out for me.
You always said so.
- Here.
- What's this?
Read it.
You want me to admit your power.
You can send this to any newspaper... and photostatic copies to all your followers.
- Isn't that what you want?
- Yes, but it's too late now.
It's six minutes to 1 0:00.
Well, I guess it was my fault for not listening toJoanna.
I'm sorry now that I didn't listen.
And I want to thank you for convincing me... of the existence of a world
I never thought possible.
Oh, if only you'd understood sooner.
I suppose...
I still have time for a last cigarette.
No, thank you.
I've stopped smoking.
It must have been quite recently.
- Have you got a match?
- Yes, of course.
Thank you.
That's all right. You keep them.
I shan't need them anymore.
You're very generous.
Well, I'll leave you two alone.
I know there's a certain feeling between you, and you might want to be alone.
Sit down. Your generosity is becoming overwhelming as it gets closer to 1 0:00.
You're staying with me, Karswell.
You've sold your bill of goods too well, because I believe you now.
I believe that in five minutes... something monstrous and horrible is going to happen.
And when it does, you're going to be here... so that whatever happens to me will happen to you.
You're insane.
You can't do this.
No?
You're staying here, Karswell.
- You're staying right here.
- No!
Let him go, Holden!
- This man's insane. I must go.
- It's all right, Doctor.
We're the police, as Holden knows.
We've had you under observation at his request.
- Fortunately for you, as you can see.
- Yes, I see. Thank you.
It's obvious that Holden has got a bit of a persecution complex about you.
Something about your putting a hex on him.
That's ridiculous. If you'll excuse me,
I'm getting out of this station.
Johnny, he's lying. He bought a ticket to Southampton. I saw it myself.
This is idiotic.
I can leave this train when I want.
- Excuse me.
- Here's your book.
It's not mine.
I found it here when I got on the train.
- Your bag, sir?
- My bag-- Oh, yes.
- Yes, of course.
- These are his too.
You want your hat and coat, don't you, sir?
Oh, yes. Very forgetful of me.
Thank you very much.
You passed them.
You slipped them in my pocket.
- It's two minutes of 1 0:00.
- Come on.
- What was that?
- Come on.
- There's a man on the track!
- What happened?
I don't know, but I think the train's hit him.
Maybe it's better not to know.
The train must have hit him and dragged him.
I thought he was on the other side, sir.
Don't be ridiculous, Simmons.
Look at him.
The train must have hit him.
You're right.
Maybe it's better not to know.
My jewels! I've been robbed!
Someone stole my jewels!
Help! Police!
My diamonds! They've gone! Help!
Monsieur Robie?
Lepic, Mercier. Monsieur Robie, we represent the Sûreté.
We are making inquiries in reference to some jewel robberies.
We believe you could provide us with information that would be helpful.
Would you be good enough to accompany us to our office in Nice?
May I put on something more formal?
- OK.
- You left in a hurry?
- They came for me.
- The police?
- Five of them.
- Naturally, you are innocent.
I haven't stolen jewellery in 15 years.
- Honesty!
- It has a good feeling.
What do you think of my kitchen?
Works like a machine.
Like our little band in the Underground during the War.
Cutting, slicing, just like the old days.
They think I'm responsible for these robberies, don't they?
- They were in prison with you.
- We're the first to be suspected.
Since the War,
I have obliged them to be honest.
I did not want them to break their paroles and return to prison.
If my parole is broken, they'll throw away the key.
I came to tell them and you that
I had nothing to do with the robberies.
Perhaps I believe you, but your comrades think you let them down.
I wouldn't put it past them to be doing the robberies themselves.
Simple men without education?
- No, Robie.
- Monsieur Bertani?
Excuse me, business calls. Don't go.
Bonjour, Foussard.
Coincidence can be terrible.
These robberies all bear your mark but you claim to be innocent.
I do more than claim. I insist!
I can't understand how this thief can imitate me so perfectly.
It's someone who knew my technique, maybe somebody in the police.
He picks perfect victims and the right stones.
Goes up walls, over roofs, leaves no clue and disappears in the night.
Just like John Robie.
- You don't believe me!
- You're as nervous as a cat.
If somebody caught this imitator, we'd all be off the hook.
Surely.
The police are chasing the wrong man.
Someone's got to chase the right one.
- One day he'll make a mistake.
- There's only one answer.
I've got to catch this imitator myself.
You couldn't do more than the police.
But I could, and I'm the only one who could, because I can anticipate him, figure out his next move and catch him with his hand in the jewel case.
Nobody will believe what you say.
Who believes me now?
The biggest problem is time.
I've got to hit him before he hears I'm after him.
I need better information, the kind that takes months to dig out.
Like who has jewels to be stolen?
Yeah. Where they live, where they keep the stones, how much they drink.
Whether they have dogs, guns, servants, insurance.
For old times' sakes, perhaps I can help you.
- What have you got?
- You made me remember something.
Two days ago, a man came here.
- I did not like him.
- Why not?
He called me to his table, asked me about crime and criminals.
Me, a respectable restaurateur!
- Does he know about the robberies?
- He asks me questions.
I refuse to answer. Then he asks me about the jewels my clients wear.
I say to myself, "You are something to do with this new cat."
"Maybe you are the new cat."
Foussard's daughter will take you by boat to the beach club in Cannes.
Wait for a phone call there.
- Mr Cat, let's go.
- Danielle, do me a favour.
- Don't call me a cat.
- I only do one favour a day.
- Will you do as your father asks?
- Did I brush your fur the wrong way?
- You're getting us wet.
- It must be true.
- Cats don't like water.
- Don't mention that word again.
- A man should never regret his past.
- I only regret one thing.
That you never asked me to marry you?
No, that I ever taught you English.
You only taught me the nouns.
I learned the adjectives myself.
- The word cat is a noun.
- Not the way you use it.
For you it means excitement, danger, affluence.
What do you think of that word,
"affluence"? It means wealth.
- What's on your mind?
- Nothing.
I was thinking about you. Imagining you in your expensive villa.
Enjoying life, while we work like idiots for a loaf of bread.
I work too, raising grapes and flowers.
And rubies and diamonds and pearls.
School's open again.
Professor Robie will conduct a class on how to get spanked in a hurry.
You can't touch me. I've graduated.
Are you going to South America?
No, just the beach club at Cannes.
I've always dreamed of going to South America.
People say it's a virgin country.
I can cook, sew, keep my mouth shut and peddle stolen jewels on the black market.
You don't think I'm responsible for all those recent robberies?
I think so.
Yes, together with your father and my Resistance pals.
There's one great difference.
They are furious with you. I am not.
Listen carefully. I stole once, a long time ago. I went to jail.
I know. You escaped, joined the Underground and became heroes.
I wanted to make up for the things
I'd done. I've never stolen since.
I know what you've got.
Pardons that are not worth anything.
They were paroles, and we fought for six years to earn them, those of us who were still around.
Those paroles don't have much value.
They haven't been withdrawn from circulation.
- No South America?
- No, just the beach club at Cannes.
Well, in that case we should hurry.
That airplane probably belongs to the police.
- What's he doing now?
- He's coming back over us.
- Good. Well, wave to him.
- Suppose he's not my type.
Wave anyway, as if you're a pretty girl out for a ride.
Well...
Not that pretty!
We want to get rid of him.
- How much further to the club?
- About 15 minutes.
When you get there, pull inshore and mingle with the other boats.
- And then?
- I'm getting out.
- I'll leave my clothes with you.
- But you hoped to be inconspicuous!
Nobody will recognise me in these.
- Hello?
- The man I speak with you about.
The man who ask about the jewels.
He will wait for you at the flower market in Nice.
He will find you. I told him you would be tossing a coin in the air.
Tails?
HH Hughson, Lloyd's of London.
Are you the man who knows who owns the best jewellery in this vicinity?
- We insure the important pieces.
- Insurance? That's gambling.
Shall we say betting?
Yes, let's say betting.
I have a long shot for you.
A little help in return for some of your losses.
- So Mr Bertani told me.
- Are you interested?
The proposition sounds intriguing, albeit a little unorthodox.
Does that mean yes or no?
- My dear Mr Robie...
- Smith.
I beg your pardon. Ever been married?
- No. What has that to do with it?
- It might help you to understand.
I have two wives,
Felicity and the London office.
I must return worthy of both.
I see. They wouldn't approve of your giving me a list of clients?
Officially, you come under the category of extremely bad risk.
I'll see you later.
It's a pleasure to meet an insurance agent who enjoys paying off claims.
- Unofficially, there's hope for you.
- I was sure there would be.
- We're both taking a big chance.
- What happens to you if I'm caught?
- I might be embarrassed or censured.
- They could put me away for good!
You made a bad choice of profession.
Let's come to an understanding.
I'm doing you a favour.
I take the risks, you get the jewellery back.
Mr Smith, it strikes me that only an honest man would be so foolish.
- How much do you need?
- Half a dozen names.
Anything else?
Addresses, habits, descriptions of the stones and settings.
Suppose it gets into the wrong hands?
It already has, unless you're the thief. Where are you staying?
Carlton, Cannes.
No, my dear fellow, not in the middle of the day.
Bring it to the table with you.
Come along.
Under the circumstances, do you think it pays to advertise?
He hasn't left the villa in years.
- How do you like the place?
- Immensely.
It's a kind of heaven, where a man dreams he'll go when he retires.
About that list of clients who have jewellery worth stealing.
- Why don't we enjoy our lunch first?
- I don't want to seem impatient.
But I have to come up with something convincing for the magistrate.
It's a nice custom they have here.
Provisional liberty based on insufficient evidence.
That may not last long for me.
- You were in the Underground Army.
- I was in the Resistance.
- Did you kill many people?
I know what would have pleased you.
Not one of them was insured.
You're a man of obvious good taste in everything.
- How did you... Why did you...?
- Why did I take up stealing?
To live better, to own things, to acquire this good taste you enjoy and which I'm reluctant to give up.
- You were frankly dishonest?
- I tried to be.
I thought you'd have some tale of hardship, your mother ran off when you were young, your father beat you.
No. I was in an American trapeze act in a circus that travelled in Europe.
It folded, so I put my agility to a more rewarding purpose.
You have no other defence?
I only stole from people who wouldn't go hungry. Your plate.
- Quiche Lorraine, you'll enjoy this.
- I've heard of it.
- It looks delicious.
- Yes.
It's wonderful.
The pastry is as light as air.
Germaine has sensitive hands, an exceedingly light touch.
I can tell.
She strangled a German general once, without a sound.
Extraordinary woman.
I take it you were a sort of modern Robin Hood.
You gave away most of the proceeds of your crime.
Kept everything myself. Let's face it,
I was an out-and-out thief.
- Like you.
- I say, steady on.
Wait. Did you ever take an ashtray from a hotel, or a towel?
Souvenirs, they expect that.
You're given an expense allowance for your meals, right?
This meal is free. Are you going to deduct it from your expense account?
- No, it would be stupid. You agree?
- Yes.
You're a thief.
Only an amateur, of course.
But it will help you sympathise with us professionals.
- I don't understand.
- Look at it this way.
- You're sorry you took the ashtray?
- Right now, yes.
You'll be sorry you didn't deduct this lunch from your account.
I can't deduct every little item.
I couldn't spare the time!
Some day, you'll wish you had.
If an ashtray is missing, they don't come for you.
Let a diamond bracelet disappear and they shout, "Robie, The Cat!"
You don't have to spend every day proving your honesty. I do.
Let's get down to business. The list.
- Is something bothering you?
- I told the police.
- I didn't expect them to like it.
- They thought it a splendid idea.
They hope you'll provide the evidence against you.
Ah, yes.
It had to be something like that.
- Suppose it all goes wrong?
- You're wasting time.
Quite a thorough job.
Have some wine, Hughson.
Yes, I think I will.
I wish I'd known someone in insurance when I started in the burglary business.
Let me see, my first bait will be this Mrs Stevens, the American with the diamonds and the daughter.
I'm having dinner with them tomorrow.
I could possibly arrange a meeting.
In this business you can't do things the honest way. Remember that.
Wouldn't it be better if you left that jewellery in the hotel safe?
I didn't buy these things for my old age. I bought them to wear.
Put your money away. You can cheat a little on your expense account.
That's France.
Everyone gets a tip, whether he's earned it or not. It's the law.
Everywhere you go, you complain about tipping.
And I shall continue to complain.
I've just paid for the privilege.
Let's go to the casino.
I want to hit the tables.
Perhaps I should just mail them the money. No, Pierre, I can't afford it.
Handsome! I wouldn't mind buying that for you.
- Mother!
- Come along.
- Mr Hughson may not like gambling.
- Everyone likes to gamble, even you.
I have an intense dislike for it.
When the stakes are right, you'll gamble.
This is imitation? Really?
You mean, costume jewellery?
The things they make! You can hardly tell it from the real thing.
Better than anything in Oregon.
- Almost everything is!
- Thank you.
Baccarat's my game. Why did you let me close to this whirling pickpocket?
Ah, wouldn't you know?
I'm terribly sorry, madam.
But, madam, that was a 10,000 franc plaque.
Maybe she... Madam, if you'd rather not take my word, it's all right.
Thank you. I'll trust you too.
I won't count it.
If Jeremiah were only here!
This flying around from Palm Springs to St Moritz to the Riviera, he'd think it was foolishness.
He used to say, "I wouldn't be a society gadabout"
"if they promised me
I could live forever."
He got his wish! Mr Burns, where did you say you were from?
- Oregon.
- Jeremiah would have liked you.
A man with both feet on the ground, that's what he was.
He never realised the value of the ground he had his feet on.
- We had a ranch...
- Mother, please.
Mr Burns would be interested.
We had a ranch, not a very big one.
No plumbing. A little thing out back.
Jeremiah will never know how close he came to 20 million barrels of oil.
Bourbon's the only drink. You can pour that champagne down the Channel.
Why wait 80 years to drink the stuff?
Great vineyards, huge barrels ageing forever, poor monks running around testing it, so some woman in Oklahoma can say it tickles her nose!
Mother, we ought to go to bed.
Nobody ever calls me Jessie any more.
Mr Burns, would you call me Jessie?
- I'd be happy to.
- Good.
Mr Hughson, would you call me Jessie?
- If you like.
- I like.
- Mr Burns, you said lumber?
- That's right.
How come you haven't made a pass at my daughter? Don't say, "Oh, Mother!"
- Mr Burns, I asked you a question.
- Very pretty.
Quietly attractive.
But too nice. Sorry I ever sent her to that finishing school.
- They finished her there!
- Come on, Mother.
And so to bed, where I can cuddle up to my jewellery.
You know, Mr Hughson, as rare and wonderful as they are,
I'd rather have 100,000 Jeremiahs.
- I'll toddle along to my cot.
- I'll escort you to your suite.
- Very thoughtful. Come on, Jessie.
- Do you make much money at lumber?
Right now, building is booming.
Would you mind if I had you investigated?
Not at all. With what object?
If I were Francie's age, you'd sound too good to be true.
Thank you. You know, there's very little lumber around here.
Why did you come to the Riviera?
To meet someone as charming as you.
Boy, now I am going to have you investigated!
- Aren't you going in?
- I'm down the other end.
How much did he get away with?
The gems were insured for 35,000 in dollars.
Somebody wins, somebody loses.
I sympathise. Pretty rough having to send bad news back to your office.
I insured Madame Leroux personally.
At least you know that the burglar...
What do they call him?
- The Cat.
- Yes.
He's still around and getting closer all the time. That's something.
Mrs Stevens, would you keep your jewellery in the hotel safe?
- Do I wear the safe round my neck?
- Not literally.
Your insurance company goes into shock every time something's stolen.
If you haven't any guts, you shouldn't have taken my bet.
- Do you wanna welch?
- If they're stolen, you'll be paid.
But we couldn't replace the affection you have for those pieces.
I have no more affection for that jewellery than I have for a train ticket.
They're pretty and make it possible for my daughter to go to places and not be ashamed of me, that is, too ashamed of me.
- Good morning, Mr Hughson.
- Good morning.
- Mr Burns.
- You sent for me.
I thought we might go for a swim or, if you're not athletic, sunbathing.
I think I can manage to stay afloat.
Mr Hughson's been telling us about a robbery.
Who?
Madame Leroux, wife of a high government official. $35,000.
Too bad. You should find a more happy business.
The famous jewel thief, The Cat, is loose again.
Mother, you're next.
I'm insured.
- I'll get my bathing trunks.
- I'll be down in a few minutes.
- Good hunting, Hughson.
- Just a minute.
- Weren't we going to...?
- Weren't we going to what?
- Last night we discussed going up.
- Up?
- Up the funicular railway.
- I can't even spell funicular!
What are you doing this afternoon?
A real estate agent gave me a list of villas for rent.
Do you plan that long a vacation?
I might even retire here.
Some of the villas aren't in good repair. The roofs need examination.
Don't let the robbery spoil your day.
It's only money, and not even yours!
Shall I ask the social director to introduce us?
No, I was wondering which was the best way out.
- The Mediterranean's this way.
- I'm a gambler. Let's try that.
There's a message for you.
Thank you.
You performed a beautiful robbery last night.
Strictly routine.
You steal a small fortune and then lie on the beach with an American beauty.
That's why one needs a small fortune.
- Is this your next victim?
- She's a useful friend.
Your old friends of the Resistance who work at the restaurant, they called the police terrible names when they let you go yesterday.
Would it be bad manners to ask who tipped off the police?
They never say anything to the flics.
Somebody did.
But they would be happy if you were caught during your next job.
It's nice to know I have friends.
- Perhaps it would be better.
- Any particular reason?
I heard talk in the kitchen: What a pity if they must kill The Cat.
They will do all they can to avoid prison.
The police want me in jail.
My old friends want me dead.
- The Cat wants me out of town.
- What do you mean?
He sent me a message.
The sky is about to fall in on me.
It's foolish to remain here without knowing what may happen to you.
If you were in South America with me, you would know what will happen.
You make it sound dangerous.
It would be so much nicer to be killed by love, no?
I'll get the water out of my ear.
John, you know what sort of men they are at Bertani's.
They will do something to you.
Yes. I better get back.
What has she got more than me, except money?
And you are getting plenty of that.
Danielle, you are just a girl.
She is a woman.
Why do you want to buy an old car if you can get a new one cheaper?
It will run better and last longer.
My old car just drove off.
No, it's turned amphibious. I thought
I'd see what the big attraction was.
- And rate an introduction.
- You didn't tell me your name.
- Danielle Foussard.
- Miss Stevens.
How do you do? Mr Burns has told me so little about you.
- We met a couple of minutes ago.
- That's right, a few minutes.
Only a few minutes ago?
And you talk like old friends!
That's warm, friendly France for you!
I was asking about renting some water skis. Would you like me to teach you?
Thank you, but I was women's champion last season.
- It was just an idea.
- Were you talking about water skis?
It looked as though you were conjugating irregular verbs.
- Say something nice, Danielle.
- She looks a lot older up close.
To a mere child, anything over 20 might seem old.
A child? Shall we stand in shallower water and discuss that?
- Enjoying yourself?
- It's very nice, the sun and all.
It's too much for me.
I'll see you at the hotel.
Finish telling me why French women are more seductive than Americans.
You know what I'd like to tell you!
Here.
Do you have time for me now?
- I'm sorry I was so long out there.
- I thought you'd be a lot longer.
Well, what about cocktails?
Six o'clock suit you?
We can talk about that on the way.
- To where?
- To rent you a villa.
- Picking a villa is personal.
- I have my car.
And lunch with chicken and beer.
It's too much to expect.
A tiring, dusty trip...
You're bound to get lost. A stranger who doesn't know the language.
I was going to hire an English-speaking chauffeur.
I'll give you a wholesale rate.
- And no tipping.
- Your terms are generous.
- Too generous to refuse.
- My terms usually are.
- Where's your car?
- Right there.
I can't seem to get out of this gracefully, so let's go.
I've been waiting for you to mention that kiss I gave you last night.
Back home in Oregon, we'd call you a headstrong girl.
- Where in Oregon? The Rogue River?
- Where were you born?
In a taxi, halfway between home and the hospital.
I've lived in 27 different towns.
- Is somebody chasing you?
- Boys.
You can stop running now.
When my father died, they discovered oil on our land. I started to travel.
- The boys' fathers were chasing you?
- Yes.
I had a funny feeling they wanted my money.
I'm impressed.
Back in Oregon, we'd have called you a rich, headstrong girl.
- Money handles most people.
- You believe that?
- I've proved it.
- You're a singular girl.
- Is that good or bad?
- Good.
You know what you want, you go after it. Nothing stops you.
You make it sound corny.
You're a jackpot of admirable character traits.
I knew that.
You do things with dispatch.
No wasted preliminaries.
Not only did I enjoy that kiss,
I was awed by the efficiency behind it.
I believe in getting down to essentials.
Inviting me for breakfast, planning a swim and now this drive.
Miss Stevens, you are a girl in a million.
That's a routine compliment, but I'll accept it.
- May I ask a personal question?
- I've been hoping you would.
What do you expect to get out of being nice to me?
- More than you're willing to offer.
- I know.
You're in Europe to buy a husband.
- The man I want doesn't have a price.
- That eliminates me.
You're right. Give me a woman who knows her own mind.
No one gives you a woman like that.
You have to capture her.
- Any particular method?
- Yes.
But it's no good unless you discover it yourself.
- Are you sure this is the address?
- It's on the estate agent's list.
Let me see.
Let's look at the gardens.
No need to bother the people.
Why don't you own a place like this?
Palaces are for royalty. We're just common people with a bank account.
That sounds like your mother, not you.
We're not that different.
A few years and some grammar.
And jewellery. You never wear any.
I don't like cold things on my skin.
- Why not invent some hot diamonds?
- I prefer more tangible excitement.
- What do you get a thrill out of most?
- I'm still looking for that one.
We were going to look at the gardens.
I was interested in the architecture.
Turn of the century, isn't it?
You never mention your wife.
- I never found time to get married.
- You don't seem pushed for time.
Did you come over to add items to your diary, like the name of that French girl you swam out to meet?
- You are husband-hunting after all.
- That wasn't jealousy you heard.
Merely disappointment in your limited imagination. Teenage French girls!
I bet you snowed her under, the handsome lumber man from America.
I'll bet you told her all your trees were sequoias.
That sounds like jealousy to me.
Don't be ashamed of it. Let it out.
- You're somewhat egotistical.
- Fighting fire with fire.
- Miss Stevens?
- Yes, Mr Burns?
- You know what I think?
- About what?
- You.
- I don't really care.
Tell me.
You're an insecure, pampered woman, accustomed to attracting men.
You're not sure whether they're attracted to you or your money.
- You may never know.
- Anything else?
You need something I haven't the time or inclination to give you.
And what is that?
Two weeks with a good man at Niagara Falls.
I'm hungry. What about that picnic?
Not till we get to the picnic grounds.
- Which you've picked out.
- Which I've picked out.
- Is it far?
- A few miles.
- Lonely and secluded?
- Naturally.
Then why are we dawdling like this?
That's exactly what was running through my mind.
- Slow down.
- And let them catch us?
- Let who catch us?
- The police who were following you.
Police following me?
Yes, police following you,
John Robie, The Cat.
Lovely day! Have you ever seen any place more beautiful?
Just look at the colours of the sea and the sky, and the pink and green buildings.
Think of all those roofs you could climb over.
- Who did you call me?
- John Robie.
The jewel thief known as The Cat.
I read about you in the Paris paper.
You may have read about The Cat...
I thought you said you were hungry.
The picnic basket's in the trunk.
Try to bluff me, and I can have the fun of telling you how clever I was.
Since I'm not Mr Robie but Mr Burns, there would be hardly any point, but tell me how clever you were.
- The first thing I noticed...
- Don't sound so pleased!
I never caught a jewel thief before.
It's stimulating. It's like...
Like sitting in a hot tub?
Let me serve. First time I saw you was on the beach at Cannes.
You swam ashore from a motor boat driven by that French girl.
- You got an opener? Thank you.
- Do you want a leg or a breast?
You make the choice.
That was two days before you showed up as Mr Conrad Burns, just over from America.
- Did you swim?
- Naturally.
Don't be disappointing and sound like Mr Burns.
- I can only be myself, Miss Stevens.
- Then be yourself, John.
- I prefer Conrad.
- You can't be serious.
It's time you called me Francie.
They've tried to steal Mother's jewellery before.
When I read about the... you in the paper, a small item, but I picked it up,
I was sure Mother would catch your eye.
She did, because I liked her.
- So far, Miss Stevens...
- Francie.
- You haven't said anything clever.
- Stick around.
The next thing I noticed was something remarkable.
All evening, you looked at my mother, not at me.
- I kissed you, didn't I?
- I kissed you.
- I wasn't looking at her then.
- You were thinking about her.
- You let me say goodnight so easily.
- I'm a gentleman.
A rough lumber man from the Northwest?
I must remember to yell
"Timber!" occasionally.
Here comes the clever part.
You're just not convincing, John.
You're like an American in an English movie.
You don't talk like an American tourist.
The guidebooks say,
"Don't behave like a tourist."
You never mention business or baseball or television or wage freezes or Senate probes.
The things I left America to forget.
You're not American enough to carry it off.
- Tell me, how long has it been?
- How long has what been?
- Since you were in America.
- Four or five days.
- And Oregon?
- Two days before that.
Name three deciduous trees indigenous to the Northwest.
You're a very nice girl with too much imagination.
Talk like that and I'll go to jail for something I didn't do.
Will you rob Mother or somebody else?
- Somebody else!
- That's nice. Mother likes you.
Lady Kenton should be our next job.
Isn't she on your list?
She ought to be. The Kenton jewels are famous. I know her villa.
- I can hear your next line.
- The Cat has a new kitten.
- When do we start?
- Don't talk like that.
- You're leaving fingerprints on me.
- I am not The Cat.
Why are the police following you?
Show me that list.
That villa isn't for rent. The Sanfords own it. I'm going to a party there.
You've a very strong grip.
The kind a burglar needs.
That's why you came up here.
We'll have cocktails at 8.00 and dinner at 8.30 in my suite.
We'll talk about it there.
I can't come. I'm going to the casino and a firework display.
There's a better view from my place.
Already got another date.
Everywhere you go, I'll have you paged as John Robie, The Cat.
8.00 and be on time.
- I haven't got a decent watch.
- Steal one.
I could not speak with you today, Mr
Robie. I did not know your new name.
What were you doing at the Sanford villa?
I supply food for the grand gala.
I was inspecting the kitchen.
I do not ask you what you were
doing there. You prepare also, no?
There will be many women,
rich jewels.
- Just the bait I need.
- Something The Cat can't resist?
- I suppose your boys will be there.
- Naturally.
They threatened to put me away.
They'd be much too busy to do anything like that.
- You keep them busy.
- Goodbye, Robie.
Who was the pretty American girl?
You bring her to my restaurant
for dinner?
- Not tonight. She made plans for us.
- Soon.
If you want to see the fireworks, it's better with the lights out.
You're going to see one of the
Riviera's most fascinating sights.
- I was talking about the fireworks.
- I never doubted it.
The way you looked at my necklace,
I didn't know.
You've been dying to say something about it.
- Have I been staring at it?
- You've been trying to avoid it.
May I have a brandy? Care for one?
No, thank you. Some nights a person doesn't need to drink.
Aren't you nervous to be in a room with diamonds, unable to touch them?
No.
Like an alcoholic outside a bar on election day.
- Wouldn't know the feeling.
- All right.
You've studied the layout, worked out your timetable, put on dark clothes with crêpe-soled shoes and a rope, face blackened.
Over the roofs, down to the right apartment... and the window's locked.
All that elation turned into frustration.
What would you do?
I'd go home, get some sleep.
What would you do? The thrill is in front of you, but you can't get it.
The gems glistening on the other side of the window.
- Someone asleep, breathing heavily.
- I'd go home, get some sleep.
Wouldn't you use a glass cutter, your fist, to get what you wanted, knowing it was there waiting for you?
- Forget it.
- Drinking dulls your senses.
And if I'm lucky, some of my hearing.
Blue-white with hairlike touches of platinum.
I have the same interest in jewellery as in politics, modern poetry, or women who need weird excitement: None.
Hold this necklace in your hand and tell me you're not Robie The Cat.
John, you're going to rob that villa we cased this afternoon, aren't you?
I suppose "rob" is archaic.
You'd say "knock over"?
Don't worry. I'm good at secrets.
- Have you been to a psychiatrist?
- Don't change the subject.
I know the perfect time. Next week is the Sanfords' annual gala.
Everyone who counts will be there.
I'll get you an invitation.
It's an 18th-century costume affair.
There'll be thousands of dollars' worth of jewellery.
Some guests stay for the weekend.
We'll do it together. What do you say?
My comment would be censorable.
Give up, John. Admit who you are.
I can tell where you're looking.
Look, John. Hold them.
Diamonds, the only thing in the world you can't resist.
Then tell me you don't know what I'm talking about.
Ever had a better offer in your whole life? One with everything?
- I've never had a crazier one.
- Just as long as you're satisfied.
You know as well as I do this necklace is imitation.
Well, I'm not.
- Give them back to me.
- What did you have in mind?
Give them back. Mother's jewels.
I don't have them.
Wait a minute.
- When did it happen?
- When I was asleep.
- Let's look.
- The place to look is here!
Help yourself.
Did Francie tell you what happened?
Yes, she's searching my room.
- She knew where my jewellery was.
- May I look in your room?
If it'll do any good. We ought to call the police and the manager.
Would you let me look first?
I'd be happy if you didn't find anything.
Why do you say that?
I'm tired of draping them over me.
It's exciting to have them stolen.
You can't lose, as long as
Hughson makes out the cheque.
I'd be crazy to take this attitude if I did.
Why did Francie suspect you, Mr Burns?
A woodcutter from Oregon!
I'm anything but that, Mrs Stevens.
My real name is John Robie.
I used to be a jewel thief years ago.
- What a wonderful surprise!
- I can't get worked up over it.
- Where did you keep the stuff?
- In the case.
- Watch out for fingerprints.
- There won't be any.
- Did they get everything?
- Everything.
Francie must have known about you.
She guessed today.
You must sleep soundly.
I do.
He came down through the air shaft.
If you're not Mr Burns, why do you call yourself that and not...
- What was the other name?
- John Robie. Mrs Stevens...
- The gang won't let you go straight?
- The gang is the law.
Mother, don't talk to him.
Don't touch anything to cover any clues.
There aren't any clues. He came down the air shaft and went the same way.
- You know how he got in.
- Did you find anything in my room?
- I certainly did.
- Nothing of your mother's.
You gave those to your accomplice.
But the clothes of Mr Burns, the American, all had French labels.
I found this: Everyone on the Riviera with jewellery worth stealing.
Listen to what it says about us.
What good is that?
You're already caught.
I called the police and told them who you are and what you did tonight.
Everything? The boys must have enjoyed that down at headquarters.
He isn't Burns.
He's a jewel thief called The Cat.
What's he doing here now if he's already got the junk?
- Returning to the scene of crime.
- Since when is love a crime?
Robie is a real man, not one of those milksops you take up with.
- Mother, after all.
- After all, my foot.
Why do you think we moved so many times? Your father was a swindler.
But a lovable one. This one's a bigger operator on every level.
Thank you.
I've had to travel round after you to keep men like this away from you.
It looks like the blockers are having all the fun.
She doesn't have common sense, I do.
They're my baubles. If I don't care, why should you? They're insured.
Now, where do we go from here?
To jail.
- Where is he?
- Who?
- John Robie.
- Never heard of him.
Mother, the book you're reading
is upside down.
We may be in France, but a man is innocent till proved guilty.
- Proved!
- That won't be hard.
John Robie's the first man who wouldn't roll over for you.
He played us both for fools.
You ought to be sent back to public school.
- They could pound sense into you.
- He's a worthless thief.
- Just what did he steal from you?
- Mother!
Sit down while I tell you something about life and John Robie.
Sit down before I knock you down.
For three days, you've been fishing?
Keep it down. Do you still believe
I did the Stevens job?
Yes, until you sent for me. You'd hardly risk my bringing the police.
Thank you.
You've been in hiding.
Why did you come out?
- I need your help.
- I need yours more.
My superiors at the London office...
I might solve some of your problems, possibly all.
- That's too much to hope for.
- I've been watching a villa.
- Which one?
- The South American couple.
Somebody else is watching it too, but
I haven't managed to find out who.
- Has he seen you?
- Probably.
I want to set a foolproof trap.
I need the assistance of the police.
I can't approach them.
- How do you know he'll be there?
- Somebody gave this to Germaine.
It's in French. What does it say?
"Stay away from the Silvas' villa.
It's my night to yell, not yours."
- Who gave it to Germaine?
- It was in her shopping basket.
Look, convince Lepic to have police at the villa soon after midnight.
- You're going there?
- Of course.
That note is bait for a trap. Someone wants you to go to the Silvas'.
- I know it.
- Possibly to kill you.
- Will you talk to Lepic?
- All right.
But if this Cat doesn't show up, the police might get you and the thing will turn out rather badly.
I'd better go along as your alibi.
I know you get insurance at a discount but why be foolhardy?
Everyone in Philadelphia reads "The Bulletin".
Just a minute.
- What's all the excitement?
- The cat burglar's dead.
John Robie?
No, a man named Foussard.
A wine steward in a restaurant.
You better start practising your apologies in two languages.
You're positive Foussard was The Cat?
We have no reason to change the story.
- That's hardly a direct answer.
- I cannot give another. Excuse me.
One more point, Lepic.
This is a cheque for $280,000.
That's nearly 92 million francs.
Since you've killed The Cat...
He killed himself attempting to escape justice.
I've been instructed to pay off the Stevens claim.
I'm disinclined to do so if recovery of the jewellery is imminent. Is it?
- It will take time.
- Several centuries!
I just came in to congratulate you on your capture.
All's well that ends well. The papers have headlines, tourists can relax.
You, Lepic, got your publicity and a commendation from Paris.
Everyone got some good out of it, except Hughson's company.
- But they can afford it.
- It has cut their assets.
Poor Foussard. Never guessed it was him, a wine waiter.
Family man, wooden leg.
Didn't you know? Certainly. He lost it during the War. That's remarkable.
A man with a wooden leg climbs up walls with the agility of a cat.
- Is that true?
- I believe he had a bad leg.
You showed good taste keeping it out of the newspapers.
I'll drop into Foussard's funeral, pay my last respects.
Oh, and get a look at the real Cat, who'll be there purring.
- You know who the real Cat is?
- I do.
- Tell the Commissioner.
- He wouldn't believe me.
- Try me.
- You'd find it hard to believe.
When I catch The Cat with a handful of stolen diamonds...
It's because I gave this story you're at liberty.
If I catch you on a roof,
I'll call the reporters again.
Lepic, that's all I wanted to know.
Good day.
- A most unhappy affair, Robie.
- Because it isn't me down there?
Poor Danielle.
I have a great compassion for her.
I'll look out for her.
What happened to the stuff he stole?
That's a mystery. The police have looked in every place.
- Some day, it'll turn up.
- The boys owe you many thanks.
- For what?
- You know.
For risking prison to capture The Cat.
Oh, that.
But you have no reason to complain.
Could you be a little more specific?
The American girl, what's her name?
Francie Stevens, that the one?
What luck.
A beautiful woman with love for you, rich beyond your dreams.
- I dream pretty rich.
- When are you going to America?
I didn't know I was.
You will make a great mistake if you don't marry her and return to your native country.
Let's talk about it at the Sanford gala, between your catering duties.
- You are not invited.
- I will be.
- What costume will you wear?
- Something to surprise you.
Good luck.
Killer!
It's because of you he is dead!
Get out! Get out of here!
Killer, voleur, murderer!
John?
John?
- Will you make it hard to apologise?
- Not at all, I'm sure you're sorry.
You know I am. I had no idea of the things you were up against.
What are your plans now?
- Now what?
- That the cat burglar's dead.
Foussard isn't The Cat.
The man had a wooden leg.
- Wasn't he trying to rob a villa?
- He was trying to kill... me.
- Why?
- I was too close to The Cat.
- Who killed him?
- If I find out, I'll let you know.
- Bye, Francie.
- John, why bother?
- It's a hobby of mine, the truth.
- Let me do something to help you.
No, thanks. You've made your apology.
Let's go back to mutual disregard.
Mr Robie, I was wrong about you,
I think. You might be wrong about me.
Well, I may never know.
- Pardon me...
- I won't pardon you!
I'm in love with you.
- That's a ridiculous thing to say.
- Is it?
- To you, words are just playthings.
- Were playthings.
- I'll make you a sporting offer.
- I don't know if I'm up to it now.
Get me an invitation to the Sanfords.
- You can't go without a costume.
- What are you wearing?
Louis XV. Mother and I got them in Paris.
I'll phone you in a day or two.
You probably wonder why I want to go.
I have an idea.
I thought you might like to see a real burglar in action.
Will it be dangerous?
Not for tourists.
We're in! Any man without a lady on his arm can only be a policeman.
- My nerves could stand a drink.
- Your nerves and your mother!
There they are, Commissioner Lepic and one of his men.
Wigs, pantaloons and flat feet.
Come on.
My heart pills! I can't drink champagne without my pills.
- Where do you think you left them?
- In our room. They're in my purse.
- Be a sweetie, John, and get them.
- Of course. I'd be delighted.
- Mother!
- All I said was...
Never mind what you said.
Thank you, dear.
Shall we dance?
Well, I hope the London office appreciate what I've done for them.
My feet are killing me.
Mother was quite an actress.
She played her part well.
Heart pills!
I didn't think this scheme of yours would work, Francie. But it has.
I figured it was you the night your father died. You always did his legwork!
Come down!
Come down or we shall be forced to shoot!
- He's not The Cat!
- What does he do on that roof?
- Your job.
- I only believe what I see.
- Shoot him and I'II...
- Robie's where I knew he'd be.
He's not alone up there.
- Pull me up!
- Don't shout, it makes me nervous.
- Then drop me.
- Whatever you say.
You've got a full house.
Begin the performance.
- What performance?
- Tell them who is really who.
Please, I might slip.
- I can hold you for 30 seconds.
- I did it for my father.
That's fine, but I already know.
Tell them down there.
- I kill you when I get up there.
- Tell them.
I was working for my father!
Now, please!
- Your father is dead. Who else?
- That's all.
My fingers are beginning to open.
Tell them who was behind it. Who knew as much about me as I knew? Go on!
- Bertani's was behind it.
- You're telling them, remember.
- Bertani's was behind it!
- That's right.
Now, please, I'll die!
- Who brought you here?
- The police.
We'd have caught you if my dress hadn't got caught on the gear shift.
- I only just said goodbye.
- As quickly as you could.
- Didn't I thank you?
- Politely.
You left in such a hurry you almost ran!
I had work to do up here.
Were you afraid to admit you just can't do everything by yourself?
You needed the help of a good woman.
You aren't the Ione wolf you think you are.
Without you I couldn't have done it.
I needed the help of a woman.
I guess I'm not the Ione wolf
I thought I was, Francie.
Well, I just wanted to hear you say that. Thank you.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
So this is where you live.
Mother will love it up here!
ENGLISH
One more.
Just one more, please, Dr. Meacham.
Hold it, please.
A little closer to the wing, sir.
A little more profile, Dr. Meacham.
Yeah, he wants to get that faraway, visionary look.
Cal, we know how tired you must be.
We'll make it as short as possible.
Fire away, gentlemen.
But I warn you,
I am beginning to feel faraway and visionary.
How about your conference with the Committee on Atomic Power?
Oh, not my conference.
20 engineers and scientists were there.
Hardly a routine meeting, would you say?
Yeah, and look, Cal, we won't buy the committee's getting you VIPs together for a cocktail party.
All right, boys, I'll tell you this much.
Under discussion was the biggest job we've ever tackled, the industrial application of atomic energy.
But that's not news, Cal.
We all know there've been several industrial reactors in work already.
Well, let us say then that, in the light of recent developments, those plants may already be obsolescent.
Electronics is your specialty.
How does that fit in with atomic energy?
You boys like to call this a push-button age.
It isn't, not yet.
Not until we can team up atomic energy with electronics.
Then we'll have the horses as well as the cart.
How long has the Army been handing out jets, Doctor?
One of the boys at
Lockheed handed me this one.
I hope you taxpayers don't mind.
Cal, when do we get to this push-button age?
When fellows like me stop talking about it and get back to our labs.
I'll see you gentlemen later.
- Goodbye.
- So long.
Cal.
Cal, are you working on anything along the lines you mentioned?
Roughly.
Well, remember me, will you?
I'm concentrating on the re-conversion of certain common elements into nuclear energy sources.
Huh?
How's that again?
What counts is how I make it work.
I see.
Have a good flight, Cal.
Thank you.
So long.
2XD341, calling
Ryberg Control Tower, come in.
2XD341, this is Ryberg Control Tower.
Go ahead.
Okay to come in, Webb?
All clear, Cal.
The drift's south, about 20 miles per hour.
Hi, Webb.
What's Cal's ETA?
Half an hour late.
That's my boss.
The only guy in the world who can travel by jet and still be late.
So you talk about me when I'm gone.
Where are you?
Look out the window.
Cal, what's wrong?
I have no control.
Cut loose, Cal.
Bail out!
I can't.
I'm too low.
Jerking around must have caused a flame out.
No power.
No nothing.
Cal, you okay?
Okay.
What happened?
How'd you bring it in?
I didn't.
Couldn't.
What do you mean, you didn't?
Controls went out.
Huh?
That's right, no controls, no power.
The plane died up there.
I should be dead...
Cal, I know everybody's seeing flying saucers and screwy lights up in the sky.
Well, you can put me in the booby hatch, too, because, so help me,
I saw this ship turn a bright green up there.
Are you sure, Joe?
Positive.
Did you hear anything?
Yes.
A high-frequency howl.
Very high.
All the time your ship was...
Green?
Did Webb see it?
Unless he's blind.
Check him.
Right.
Oh, and, Joe, until we find out what happened, all three of us were blind.
How's the little giant?
Growing up.
Getting ready to astound the world.
Let's take a look.
I figured that.
She's all ready and waiting.
Lowering the cylinder.
Increase the rate of reaction.
Check rate of radioactive decay.
Positive.
The same it was the whole week you were away.
What did the committee say?
Oh, they were a little excited.
A little?
Zero reading.
The XC condenser must have shorted out again.
Get the spare.
Burned out yesterday.
And don't ask me why I didn't order some new ones.
I did.
XC condensers in an envelope?
Must be a gag dreamed up by the receiving department.
I ordered two XC condensers, and Supreme Equipment sent me these beads.
You say they're a gag, but they're condensers.
I checked one for capacity and voltage on the meter.
And blew it to bits.
Yeah.
After it held to 33,000 volts and no leakage.
If that were true, we could build a generator.
One that would supply electric power to run an entire factory.
It would fit in a matchbox.
It still read 33,000 volts.
I'll try one on voltage test.
I've got one set up for you.
Into thin air.
35,000 volts.
Call Pete Knowles at Supreme.
Okay.
Pete Knowles, please.
Pete?
Cal Meacham.
I ordered two XC condensers and you sent me some beads.
Yes, beads.
Well, I am serious.
I just tested one bead for voltage and...
Oh?
Well, thanks.
Supreme didn't send them.
They're crazy.
Pete says they've had no condenser order from us in six weeks.
Here's the duplicate of the order
I sent by teletype three days ago.
What's the address on the letterhead that came with the beads?
No address.
Look.
"Dear Dr. Meacham,
"In place of the condensers you ordered,
"we are sending you our AB-619 model.
"We are certain it will interest you.
"Director, Electronic Service, Unit 16."
I thought it was a subsection of Supreme.
Electronic Service, Unit 16.
Well, at least we can find out what they're made of.
A diamond drill, the hardest element we've got.
The bead isn't even scratched.
Experimental lab, Wilson speaking.
Yeah, sure.
Sam wants to talk to you.
He's at the hangar, he's been checking over the plane.
Good.
Hello, Sam.
Sam can't find anything wrong.
Did you double check the controls?
Of course not, I, now, look here, Sam.
All right, Sam, you win.
Maybe I did have just a couple, but, all right.
Good night.
Maybe I should have had a couple.
Maybe I will.
Morning.
Sign here.
Thank you.
What have you got?
I don't know.
There's no return address.
Electronics Service, Unit Number 16.
A catherimine tube with an endiom complex of plus four.
What are they talking about?
I don't know, but this outfit has them.
This isn't paper.
It's some kind of metal.
"Interocitor incorporating planetary generator.
"Interocitor with Volterator.
"With Astrascope."
Here's something my wife could use in the house, an "Interocitor incorporating an electron sorter."
Although she'd probably gain 20 pounds while it did all the work for her.
You know, Joe, according to this, there's no limit to what it can do.
Laying a four-lane highway at the rate of a mile a minute would be a cinch.
Cal, maybe we've been working too hard.
"Complete line of Interocitor parts,
"incorporating greater advances
"than hitherto known in the field of electronics."
What exactly is an Interocitor?
I don't know.
And I don't want to know.
Well, I do.
I want to know what it is and what it does.
Order the list of parts on these pages.
How are we gonna build it?
These symbols, they're like a foreign language.
And anyway, we don't know the address.
Well, you ordered the condensers from Supreme by teletype.
Yeah?
Which means that somebody intercepted that order and sent us those beads.
Here, try it again.
You're too darn smart.
I may be the dumbest man who ever walked this Earth, Joe.
Here's the invoice.
No charge and no address.
And listen to this,
"No Interocitor part can be replaced.
"Bear this in mind while assembling."
Well, let's start unpacking.
There's 2,486 parts.
Each part is cross-indexed into a symbol pattern.
Shouldn't be too hard at all.
Sure.
A snap, maestro.
Only, where do we start?
Right here.
You know what my kids would say.
Dig this crazy, mixed-up plumbing!
Plug it in, Joe.
We'll see what happens.
Now what do I do?
Clear your screen, please.
You can hear me?
Of course.
Use the intensifier disk.
The one in your hand.
Place it in position on your right.
Now turn the control
18 degrees to the left.
You have successfully accomplished your task, Dr. Meacham.
You've assembled an Interocitor, a feat of which few men are capable.
Who are you?
I'm called Exeter.
I'm a scientist like yourself
Shall we say, a colleague.
My colleagues don't materialize out of strange machines.
They're flesh and blood.
And so am I, Dr. Meacham, as I hope you'll soon find out.
Although I admit at the moment, I do appear immaterial.
But no matter.
I represent a group which is seeking scientists of exceptional ability.
All prospects must pass an aptitude test, which you've just done.
I'm flattered.
Only I don't remember applying for any job.
You didn't.
I beg your pardon, Mr. Wilson.
Your camera will pick up nothing but black fog.
Images on the Interocitor don't register on film.
Put it away, Joe.
To continue, Dr. Meacham, we test out people without their knowledge.
We leave nothing to chance.
Except the chance that I'm not interested in you or your group.
Come, come, Doctor, it's not possible that a man of your scientific curiosity wouldn't want to find out who I am, where I come from.
Wouldn't give his right arm for more examples of our superior technical knowledge.
I think I can assume, Dr. Meacham, that you're sufficiently intrigued to come to an immediate decision.
We'd like you to join our team, as you might say, at once.
You'll make arrangements to leave immediately.
Wait a moment.
I didn't say...
At five o'clock Wednesday morning our plane will land at your field.
It will wait exactly five minutes and then depart.
Whether I'm aboard or not?
Place the catalog on that table with the blueprints.
Now stand aside, please.
You too, Mr. Wilson.
Just a minute.
Please step back or you maybe harmed.
Further back.
You okay?
Okay, within reason.
If there is any reason around here.
There's no reading now.
Cal.
Yes, Joe?
Whatever that Exeter is, I don't like it.
Don't you, Joe?
He was right about one thing.
I'm gonna be on that plane.
Cal, won't you reconsider?
I did, all night.
And as a committee of one,
I came to a series of decisions at exactly the fifth cup of coffee.
One, whatever scientific knowledge this Exeter character has should be in our textbooks.
Two, Joe Wilson, my able assistant, knows enough about a certain experiment to carry on without me for a while.
I'm not sure of that, Cal.
Look, Joe, my committee decided I'm expendable.
Nothing you can say will change that.
You always were an obstinate, oh, well, I'm not worried.
Not even a moth equipped with a lightning bug could fly in here this morning, so no plane is...
He made it.
No pilot.
No windows.
Cal, you'll really be flying blind.
Please be seated, Dr. Meacham.
And welcome aboard.
A seat belt is not required, Doctor.
Please clear the stairs.
Thank you.
So long, Joe.
I'll be dropping you a card.
Cal, get off, right away!
This whole thing smells to high heaven!
Cal, I'm begging you!
Don't go!
Please, don't go!
Good morning, Dr. Meacham.
Hope you slept well.
We'll be landing shortly.
Good morning.
Good morning.
Where am I?
Georgia.
I kind of expected Neptune or Mars.
Exeter asked me to greet you.
I'm Dr. Ruth Adams.
Ruth Adams!
But this is wonderful!
I never expected,
Ruth, I'm Cal Meacham.
Cal.
Dr. Meacham, of course.
Four or five years ago, conference on thermal problems in nuclear reactors.
Boston, wasn't it?
Vermont.
We were lecturing to a symposium of graduate students.
Summer, three years ago.
After classes we'd go swimming in a little river near the school.
You were an awful sissy about that icy water.
Oh, Ruth, don't tell me you've forgotten.
Dr. Meacham, all I can say is I'm deeply flattered, and maybe a little envious of the girl you've mistaken me for.
And now I think Exeter is waiting to greet you.
I'm sure you must be puzzled, Doctor.
I'll never forget my own feelings on the day of my arrival.
Exeter isn't exactly conventional in his hiring methods.
Or his choice of personnel.
I think that sounds like rather a personal dig.
Once you're at the club,
I'm sure you'll like us much better.
The club?
That's what we like to call it.
Exeter has spared nothing for our comfort or facilities for our work.
Inside looks better, Doctor.
They'll bring your bags in.
Your plane.
The elevators down to
Exeter's slave quarters.
Our laboratories.
Our living room, social center, library.
This is Exeter's office and study.
Not exactly what you expected, Dr. Meacham, is it?
Good morning, Doctor.
Good morning, Doctors.
Give me your coat.
Good morning, Herr doctor.
Good morning.
Engelborg, from Munich.
The Doctor's out for his morning constitutional.
He's been here a week, but his English and my German...
Who's that one?
That's Brack, one of
Exeter's assistants.
But you'll find them all very helpful.
What language do they speak?
Anything you wish.
English, Hindustani, Congolese.
Anything.
Dr. Meacham.
Good morning.
Good morning.
Please come in.
Both of you.
Sit down.
Dr. Adams.
Oh, yes, Steve.
About that nuclear decay factor, Ruth,
I'm afraid my equation just doesn't seem to work.
I was hoping you could find time to go over it with me later.
I still think the basic principle is all right.
And maybe we can trust...
Yes, well, thank you, Dr. Adams.
Oh, there you are, Dr. Adams.
I was just reminding Dr. Meacham that I had promised to produce some of his colleagues in the flesh.
May I use you as my exhibit A?
I'm afraid Dr. Meacham isn't too happy with me.
At the airport, he was sure we were old friends.
Obviously I was wrong.
The lady hardly remembers me.
What is more important is...
Who we are, what we're doing here.
Dr. Meacham,
I represent a group of scientists who work with but one purpose, to put an end to war.
Naturally, such a goal can't be attained without experts of superior ability, men of vision.
Men such as you, Doctor, gathered here, exchanging information daily, putting aside all thoughts of personal success.
We hope to achieve exciting new techniques, leap years ahead of the others.
I don't think I need tell you how effective our voices will be when the world learns of our achievements.
Well, there you have it.
Nothing new, perhaps, but then, what is?
However, let me assure you, Doctor, that we are dedicated men and women, and as such we can accomplish wonders.
Well?
What do you think of us?
This all sounds great,
Mr. Exeter, but why me?
Dr. Meacham, we happen to know that you are on the threshold of discovering limitless amounts of free nuclear energy.
More specifically, the conversion of lead into uranium.
Dr. Adams here has been working along the same lines as you have.
Perhaps just a step behind you.
Although I might add that both of you are way ahead of anyone else in your field.
Be careful.
Exeter will flatter you to death.
The truth is never flattering, Dr. Adams.
Now, suppose you relax and think it over.
Suppose when I do, I find
I can't go along with you?
Naturally, we'll expect you to be discreet about what you've seen here.
Otherwise, you are free to leave, Dr. Meacham.
As free as air.
And now, suppose we continue your tour of inspection, right from our chairs.
Conserving energy is one of our primary concerns, isn't it, Doctor?
Your laboratory, Doctor.
Immediately below this office, I believe.
Still under construction, but, in a few days, well, we'll have some surprises for you.
Brack?
Everything in order?
Yes.
Thank you, Brack.
Any reason why you can't start in the morning, Doctor?
No.
Another view of your laboratory, with your own Interocitor, of course.
In addition to which, we hope to provide you with...
One of our other units calling, Doctor.
Other units?
Yes, we have several at strategic points throughout the world.
Please forgive me.
We'll have a chat at dinner, Meacham.
Excellent cuisine, by the way.
Like everybody here, the chef must be dedicated to his work.
You'll find the stairway through the living room and to your right.
Your room is at the top of the stairs.
Thanks.
Dr. Meacham.
I'm still sorry I wasn't the girl in Vermont.
Yes?
Your progress report
I find is unsatisfactory.
You are failing to meet the schedule as planned.
Why?
Because certain methods imposed upon me by the council have not been effective here.
I wish to discuss it with the council.
Impossible.
The time element will not permit any dissenting opinions.
You will carry on with
Plan A as instructed.
Now, please report on status of personnel.
With the arrival of Meacham, the personnel roster is complete.
Proceed with Plan A.
What do you think of Mr. Mozart, Exeter?
I'm afraid I don't know the gentleman.
My mind must have been wandering.
Your composer, of course.
Our composer?
He belongs to the world.
Yes, indeed.
The dinner, Exeter, was even more perfect than you promised.
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I could do with some fresh air myself.
Would you care to join me, Dr. Adams?
You, Dr. Carlson?
Why don't you?
Show him the grounds.
We won't start cracking the whip on Meacham until tomorrow.
That's quite a group
Exeter has collected.
Quite.
That's Dr. Hu Ling Tang.
Tang's field is titanium, the same as Dr. Engelborg.
Dr. Marie Pitchener, U-235.
Dr. Blorfield, plutonium.
Hmm, that puts all of us in the production of nuclear energy, doesn't it, Carlson?
What are you getting at, Meacham?
Why no biochemists?
Electronic experts, mechanical engineers?
People equipped to make practical application of the energy the rest of us produce.
I seem to remember that was part of Exeter's pitch.
We try to make it a rule around here, Doctor, not to discuss our work after hours.
Now, how about that fresh air?
How about you and Dr. Adams showing me my laboratory instead?
After all I've heard today,
I can hardly wait to add my little contribution to the good work.
This way, Doctor.
Your lab and my lab are in this wing.
Steve and the others are on the right.
This is yours, over here.
It's only Neutron.
We call him that because he's so positive.
Stay off Dr. Meacham's equipment.
Well, what do you think of it?
It's not bad.
Should be able to get started very quickly.
Fine, but a word of warning.
Don't let Exeter push you too hard.
He's the kind of man who wants results yesterday.
This is the same size lead slab I use in my own lab.
I guess you're right.
I guess Exeter doesn't expect me to waste any time.
This is very interesting.
Now, standing here with the lead slab in front of us, the lead reactor panel behind us, we're shielded from nuclear rays.
Could be even from the prying eyes of Exeter's Interocitor.
What's your opinion, Doctors?
All right, I'll spell it out for you.
The two of you walk around here as if you're scared of your own shadows.
Ruth's even afraid to admit she and I once might have held hands.
Well, that's okay with me.
But either I've got to figure I'm a little cracked, or that Exeter's cat has got both your tongues.
You ever stop to think that we have a right to throw a few questions at you, Meacham?
What are you doing here?
Look, I received a darn fool catalog.
I couldn't resist it.
I built an Interocitor, arrived on that trick plane and that's all I know.
But so help me, in the next 10 minutes,
I'm gonna know a lot more.
I believe him, Steve.
Well, I guess I do, too.
Now we're getting somewhere.
To begin with, Cal,
I was the girl in Vermont.
Then why all of that...
Because we couldn't take a chance.
There's always the possibility you spent a few minutes under one of Exeter's sun lamps before you got here.
Sun lamp?
That's what it looks like.
Only instead of a sun tan, you get your brain cells rearranged.
Steve had a peek at one.
Yeah, it's similar to a lobotomy.
Renders useless certain areas of the brain.
Those areas controlling the power of the will.
Up until now, Steve and I have been spared.
We think Engelborg, too, but we haven't the slightest idea why.
And what about the others?
Try talking to them.
Well, that leaves the big one.
Who's Exeter working for?
We don't know.
All we do know is what you've already guessed.
Exeter is desperately trying to come up with new sources of atomic energy.
And we're the geniuses he's depending upon to deliver for him.
Well, he might get a surprise.
Why did you wait, Brack?
You should have told me.
I was busy elsewhere.
If you're so concerned, why don't you let me use the transformer?
The transformer is not the only answer.
The council differs.
It says it's infallible.
The council is wrong.
I told the Monitor so today.
The transformer is morally abhorrent to the subjects.
It sets up subconscious blocks which defeat our very purposes.
You're being sentimental.
I am being practical!
No, Brack.
Use a machine to control a man's brain, you destroy his initiative.
You destroy his power to help us, as we need help.
We can both see it right here.
It maybe true, but are you sure?
We're 30 miles from nowhere.
Steve and I know, we've tried.
And if we did get out, who'd believe all this?
I don't blame you doctors for being excited about working for Exeter.
It's a rare privilege.
He's a rare man.
Our little Neutron gave us away.
He felt the impulses.
That cat, I could...
Put Neutron under the thought transformer?
Why not, Brack?
And perhaps you'd like me to step in with him.
Turn it off, Brack.
Our friends won't be giving us any more information tonight.
And the log of 236 plus
1.008 to the ninth.
It's an interesting equation.
I'll check it.
You may find it'll help you over some of the more difficult obstacles, Meacham.
And now, Doctor, I'd like to acquaint you with another of our accomplishments.
Notice that section of lead plate behind you.
Please bring it forward, about eight feet.
Now, please move back.
By the door, Doctor.
When your lead-to-uranium process is working properly, the effectiveness of this ray will be increased enormously.
Tell me, Exeter, why should a communication device be equipped with a destructive ray?
Television waves can't penetrate mountains.
With the aid of neutrino rays, we can.
Neutrino rays?
You've just observed one in action.
I suppose the neutrino could be described as the missing link between energy and matter.
Fascinating, if destruction is our goal.
On the contrary.
Just recently, one of our rays was used for quite another purpose.
More specifically, to save your life.
The green light?
Exactly.
Picking your plane up in midair and conveying it safely to Earth.
After it first immobilized my controls.
Meacham, I must ask you to have faith in our ultimate aims.
I must also ask you to refrain from meeting with any of your co-workers again, except in our usual channels.
Any way you want it.
Very good, Doctor.
And your patience, I promise you, will be rewarded.
Here's a sketch of the Interocitor.
I also have rough notes on its working controls.
It's guesswork, mostly, but better than nothing.
And these are portraits of Exeter and Brack.
Do you notice the peculiar indentations in both their foreheads?
Coincidental, no doubt.
And this is the one we're really proud of, Cal.
We discovered this about a week ago, two miles south of here.
The side of this hill has been hollowed out.
And here's an acre of canvas covering the excavation.
You tell me what's in there.
Steve wanted to go back and find out what was inside, but I guess I got cold feet.
Just like Vermont, still a sissy.
They're fine, Steve.
When we get out of here,
I'll have them framed at my own expense.
If we get out.
He's just hungry.
Goodbye, Neutron.
Confirm, please.
Plan A abandoned.
Alternate plan in effect.
Correct.
Our ionization layer is failing rapidly.
We may need transportation.
Are you prepared to leave?
We have been since your last communication.
Although Meacham and Adams are achieving positive results.
Can you give us another time period?
Impossible, but it is hoped that you will be able to complete the project here.
Bring them.
Good.
You will keep in contact until moment of departure, then remove all evidence of installation.
That is all.
Take over.
What is it?
Something I've seen before.
Get off the road, quick!
They're playing with us.
We're sitting ducks in this thing.
If we're gonna make the airport, we'll have to do it on foot.
When I stop, we'll pile out.
Take cover, fast.
Steve!
Steve!
We've got to get out of here.
Get down!
Get away!
We'll try and make the airport.
Let's go.
Is it flyable?
It should be.
Exeter keeps it here for the staff.
They're pulling us up.
Remain here.
I want a report on temperature control immediately, and use extreme caution through the thermal barrier.
Our two passengers are very sensitive to heat.
The passengers are here.
Allow me to welcome you.
I'm sorry that our visit below had to be terminated so dramatically, but time allowed for nothing else.
I can assure you, we mean you no harm.
Like Steve Carlson and Engelborg?
Like the others in that house?
What happened was beyond my control.
What happened was mass murder.
We're not all masters of our souls, Meacham.
That's a nice little phrase, coming from you.
I learned it on Earth.
Look, the two of you are beginning a strange journey.
A journey that no Earth people have ever undertaken before.
Now, whether you consider me a devil or a saint is unimportant.
What is important is that you're here on this spaceship.
Suppose then, for the time being, we call a truce.
As scientists at least, Meacham.
Ruth, don't tell me that as a woman you're not curious about our destination.
Where are we going?
To a planet we call Metaluna.
Metaluna?
There's no such planet in the solar system.
Metaluna lies far beyond your solar system, in outer space.
The Stellar Scope will convince you.
Come.
Observer, prepare a view of the second quadrant, please.
I won't ask you to condone what we've done.
All I ask is that, when you understand the plight of my people, you try to have more sympathy for our deeds.
Earth.
It's being left far behind.
Cal, it's getting hard to breathe.
We're going through the thermal barrier.
I'm afraid you'll find the temperature unpleasant for a short time.
Prepare to leave Earth's orbit.
All conversion must be completed during this time period.
Follow me, if you will.
Exeter, what are you using for power?
How are you controlling the fantastic temperature on this ship?
What's to prevent us from floating around like a bunch of balloons once we get away from Earth's gravity?
Well, to answer the last question first.
We create our own gravitational field, which means that no matter what position our ship takes in space, we here inside remain right-side-up.
But, at the moment, if we're going to get you to Metaluna alive, there's a little procedure you'll have to go through.
What are you doing to them?
Metaluna's atmospheric pressure is like that in your greatest oceans.
If we entered Metaluna's orbit without conversion, we'd be crushed to death.
Then in going from Metaluna to Earth, the tissues of our bodies would dwindle.
We'd disintegrate completely.
Correct, Meacham.
If we're fortunate enough to return to Earth.
Brack!
Yes?
You will prepare the doctors for the tubes.
You'll change into clothes such as ours, especially conditioned for life on Metaluna.
Come with me.
Place your hands above the rails.
They're magnetized.
There's an intercom system in the tubes.
You may converse as long as you're able to.
Ruth?
Yes?
You okay?
And you?
Feel like a new toothbrush.
Ruth.
Cal.
Approaching enemy-control sector.
This is Master Control awaiting instructions.
We'll energize only as necessary.
Conserve power.
Avoid contact with enemy until safety of ship is in danger.
You'll feel stronger in a few moments.
Now, I know you both feel as though you could sleep for at least 1,000 years, but then you would miss observing our approach to Metaluna.
And with your curiosity, you'd never forgive me for that.
I don't understand.
What don't you understand, Doctor?
Those two objects, they appear to be comets, but their paths are identical, almost as though some intelligence were controlling them.
Your deduction is quite correct, Doctor.
Although the objects are not comets, they're meteors controlled by spacecraft of Zagon.
They're gonna hit us, they're gonna hit us!
We've offered to make peace with Zagon, but to no avail.
Is Zagon a planet?
A planet that was once a comet, as you can see.
Their spacecraft are actually guiding the meteors against us.
Now on fourth quadrant.
Metaluna contact in three time periods.
Observer, a closer view.
View in third quadrant.
Contact in two time periods.
View in second quadrant.
Contact in one time period.
View in first quadrant at ionization layer.
What you're observing may well be the beginning of the end for our world.
The Zagon meteors are beginning to get through our ionized layer.
That haze, a field of intense radiation.
As you can well imagine, such a screen requires the output of great amounts of atomic energy.
And you're running out, that's why you were sent to Earth.
And why you sent for us.
You need uranium.
In gigantic quantities.
Our own deposits are exhausted.
As our power diminishes, our protection fails.
That's enough, normal view.
Entering ionized layer.
Metaluna.
Brack, remove the equipment of our two doctors to turbine center.
Have it all set up for immediate use.
Oh, Brack, I'm sure personnel will need everyone.
Have the crew report immediately for reassignment.
Now, we must report to the Monitor.
Step in.
Our means of interior transportation.
Before the war forced us to move inside of our planet, these tubes covered the surface of our Earth.
Our educational complexes.
Now, rubble.
Over there was a recreation center.
This way.
The Monitor's structure.
Welcome, Exeter.
Observed your flight.
Almost counted you lost.
Your Earth creatures.
Dr. Adams.
Dr. Meacham.
The Monitor, the supreme head of our government.
Regrettable, there is no time for amenities.
I am certain your minds have difficulty grasping this transition from Earth to Metaluna.
I have given them as much indoctrination as possible.
Then you know that shortly we can expect Zagon to commence and sustain an all-out attack.
Our ionization layer must be maintained until our relocation is effected.
Relocation?
To where?
To your Earth.
A peaceful relocation.
We hope to live in harmony with the citizens of your Earth.
In harmony?
Our knowledge and weapons would make us your superiors, naturally.
Then why haven't your superior brains solved the problem of synthesizing uranium?
Most of our scientists are dead.
Our major laboratories, destroyed.
The war has reduced our population to a mere handful.
That is true, Meacham.
It is indeed typical that you Earth people refuse to believe in the superiority of any world but your own.
Children looking into a magnifying glass, imagining the image you see is the image of your true size.
Our true size is the size of our God.
Do you still insist, Exeter, that we can allow any of these Earth creatures to have free minds?
I do.
I know them.
I have lived with them.
You have wasted our time.
Take them to the thought-transference chamber.
Please come with me,
I'm afraid you have no choice.
Interocitor control, hear me. lonization failing at prime sector.
Use emergency power and repel attack.
Power transfer will begin immediately.
Our Zagon friends seem to be hitting this prime sector quite regularly.
Is that where it is, in there?
My mind is my own and nobody's gonna change it.
I'm not going into that room.
Nobody is, come on.
I'm sorry.
I'd hoped to have prepared you somewhat beforehand.
This is a mutant.
We've been breeding them here for ages to do menial work.
Well, actually, they're similar to some of the insect life on your own planet, larger, of course, with a higher degree of intelligence.
This one has been given orders to guard this corridor as long as we're here.
I beg of you, go inside, cooperate voluntarily.
If you do, I give you my word that you will not be harmed or your minds changed in any way.
You'd defy the Monitor?
I already have.
Do you believe him, Cal?
In this place, I wouldn't believe my grandmother.
Come on.
The travel cart, come on!
Where are we going?
The spaceship, at least it's safer there.
Don't you understand?
Let it happen now.
Meacham!
Ruth!
Stand back, Exeter.
Meacham, believe me, I wanna help you.
Time is short.
Get into the car.
He appears badly hurt.
Stay close to me.
Stand back.
I command you, stand back!
Cal!
Are you badly hurt?
I'll be all right.
Close off all hatches.
Control room, quick.
I'm all right.
Ruth, activate the Stellar Scope, right control, 45 degrees left.
Our ionization layer has failed completely.
Will we be able to get out?
Depends on the amount of energy we have left.
If we have to ward off any heavy Zagon attacks,
I don't know.
That may be the last of them.
Yes.
They're concentrating all their attention on Metaluna.
Those flashes of light, they're meteors, hundreds of them.
The intense heat is turning
Metaluna into a radioactive sun.
The temperature must be thousands of degrees by now.
A lifeless planet.
And yet, yet still serving a useful purpose, I hope.
Yes, a sun.
Warming the surface of some other world.
Giving light to those who may need it.
Now, into the converter tubes.
Ruth, you take the first tube.
You, the next.
What about you?
I'll use the third tube.
Exeter, are these tubes strong enough to keep him out?
Possibly, he's bleeding badly.
In a very few moments, the pressure should destroy him.
Run, Ruth, run!
Our speed is diminishing.
We're now in the atmosphere of Earth.
Your plane is where you left it, in the cargo hold.
A conventional way for you to return to Earth, I admit, but perhaps the most practical.
Where are you going?
Our universe is vast, full of wonders.
I'll explore, perhaps find another Metaluna.
A place inhabited by beings not unlike myself.
You see, I'm more adventurous than you imagined me.
Exeter, you're a liar.
You've used all your power bringing us here.
Even if you had a place to go, you couldn't make it.
Come with us.
We'll heal your wounds.
I'm afraid my wounds can never be healed.
You've things to teach us.
Thank you.
We're over your Earth now.
It's time for you to go.
Farewell.
Home.
Thank God, it's still here.
The black widow, deadliest of all spiders,
earned its dark title through its deplorable practice of devouring its mate.
I hope you find your mother better, honey.
Thank you, darling.
- Take good care of yourself.
- I'll be all right.
And you stay just as long as you think she needs you, understand?
I will.
- Did you get another bottle of vitamins?
- Yeah, I got 'em.
And don't forget about Lottie's party.
Oh, I'm not going to that shambles.
Now, Peter, just a minute.
I'd just as soon go to a party in an insane asylum.
But that's not the point, darling.
She's the star of your show.
You simply can't treat her like that.
All right, then let her give better parties.
What do you want to do, hurt her feelings all over again?
Don't you think you better get on that plane?
Never mind the plane.
I want you to promise me you'll at least make an appearance at that party.
With Brian and Lottie living practically on top of us, why, I don't want to get into a feud with her again.
- But those people she invites.
- Just for a few minutes anyway.
Okay, okay.
I'll drop in for a minute or two anyway.
That's all that I ask. Just long enough for her to see that you're there.
If she'll look fast enough.
I'll call you by 12:00.
Never fear. I'll be home long before that.
And so I went to Lottie's party.
Oh, no, you don't.
You're not going to leave me in there all by myself.
Where on earth did you and Lottie meet all these people?
Who's met 'em?
- Bring Mr. Denver a drink, will you?
- Yes, sir.
Yours is the first face
I've recognized here tonight.
- Well, where's Lottie?
- Oh, she's around someplace, worming her way into someone's heart, as usual, I should imagine.
Hello.
Oh, darling! I'm so glad you could come.
There's something
I've been wanting to tell you for ages.
Your husband is, without a doubt, the worst dramatic critic in New York.
For one thing...
Oh, thank you.
What did Iris do, break her own leg?
No, I just put her on a plane.
Her mother's sick again.
Would you like to go out on the terrace?
Good heavens.
You're not thinking of jumping, are you?
But you don't mind my being this frank, do you?
I couldn't be more interested, Miss Marin.
Except my husband isn't a critic.
How sweet of you to agree with me.
No, I mean I'm afraid you've got me mixed up with somebody else.
My husband is Franklin Walsh, the banker.
Banker? Well, then what are you doing in that hideous hat?
Would you mind saying just a word or two to me?
On what subject?
I don't think it really matters.
It's just that my mother always told me that if a girl could be at a party for 30 minutes without getting a man to talk to her, she might just as well go on home and shoot herself.
I've already been here 25.
Well, in that case,
I'll be very happy to save your life.
- You a friend of Lottie's?
- No, I don't even know her.
That's a funny thing about New York.
Sometimes you meet the hostess at a party like this, and sometimes you don't.
I came to this one with another girl, but she's disappeared.
And everybody else here is so important.
- Are you?
- Not very.
May I ask your name?
- Peter Denver. What's yours?
- Oh, dear.
- What?
- You're important too.
- What's your name?
- Nancy Ordway.
- Actress?
- No, I'm a writer.
At least I'm trying to be.
I haven't had anything published yet, but I'm still at it.
How old are you?
Nineteen.
No, that's not true. I'm 20.
I just hate to admit it.
'Cause in your 20s you ought to have accomplished something.
I know.
Mozart had written an opera by the time he was 12.
You know what I mean.
You ought to have shown some talent of some kind.
- Don't you think?
- And you haven't?
Well, not yet apparently.
My last story...
Well, the editor said it was all right to write like Somerset Maugham and it was all right to write like Truman Capote, but not at the same time.
Why don't you do like everybody else and write like Hemingway?
I tried.
- Wouldn't you like a drink?
- No, I don't drink, thank you.
I used to, but I broke myself.
But if it wouldn't be troubling you too much...
What would you like?
I'm terribly hungry.
Do you think there's anything here to eat?
Well, I think I saw a tray of rather revolting little lumps on toothpicks here.
Yes. Just a minute.
- Good night, Miss Marin.
- Oh, and do give my love to dear Benjamin.
- Franklin.
- Benjamin Franklin?
That's not possible.
What are you doing after this?
Just go on home, I suppose.
Well, could I persuade you to have dinner with me first?
What about your wife?
- She's out of town for a while.
- Oh.
And you don't have to read the line like that.
The invitation is for dinner only.
I'm sorry. You're very much in love with her, aren't you?
- Very much.
- I know.
How do you know?
How could I not know?
It's a famous marriage.
Famous Broadway producer, a famous actress.
Even in Savannah people know that.
So all right then. What do you say?
I'd like very much to have dinner with you.
Okay, then let's go.
Darling, how wonderful to see you without your wife.
Yes. We've been...
Oh, Peter, you poor thing.
I've neglected you shamefully.
Who is this?
- One of your guests, darling. Miss Nancy...
- Ordway.
Your hostess, Miss Carlotta Marin.
- How do you do, Miss Marin?
- Oh, I'm terribly sorry, pet, but there are always so many people at my parties that I didn't invite that I rarely get a chance to speak to my guests.
I'm terribly sorry, but I'm afraid
I'm one of the ones you didn't invite.
Oh, really? Then let us say there are always so many guests that I rarely get a chance to speak to those I didn't invite.
- Where are you taking her?
- Out to dinner.
After which we're going to say good night to each other.
And at 12:00 when Iris calls,
I'm gonna tell her all about it myself, thus saving you the trouble, sweetie.
Good night. Come on, Miss, uh...
Ordway. Good night, Miss Marin.
And I never said a mumbling word.
Yeah, I went. That's the trouble living in the same building with Lottie.
You can't very well get out of her parties.
- How long did you stay?
- Not long.
I took a kid I met there out to dinner.
She's about 20, I guess, so if you hear I'm running around with moppets while you're away, that's right.
Did she get the job?
No, that's the funny part about it.
She's not an actress. She's a writer.
Matter of fact, she didn't seem that much interested in the theater.
- You want to bet?
- No, I guess not.
Just wait until the next time you see her.
You'll find out how uninterested in the theater she is.
Except there ain't gonna be no next time.
This baby eats too much.
Do you know what that kid got away with for dinner?
A whole mess of marinated herring, two big bowls of pea soup, steak about the size of a doormat, four vegetables and some tomatoes, a bucket of salad, some cheese and a chocolate nut sundae.
No coffee.
Lottie's party and my meeting with Nancy Ordway
was on the sixth of June.
Let us now go back exactly three months
to the sixth of March,
which, as we learned later, was when Miss Ordway arrived in New York.
Yes?
Don't you really recognize me?
Well, Nanny. Good heavens. Come in.
Here, let me.
No wonder. You've grown so.
Even if I had been expecting you,
I wouldn't have looked for a beautiful young woman.
- Well, how old are you now anyway?
- I'll be 20 next month.
You were still in pigtails the last time I saw you.
That was six or seven years ago.
Yes, I suppose so.
Well, come on. Take off your hat.
- Make yourself comfortable.
- Thanks.
But don't worry.
I haven't come to put up on you.
This is just to say hello and leave my stuff here, if you don't mind, while I look for a place of my own.
- I'm gonna live in New York now.
- Tired of Savannah?
Well, after Mama died, there was nothing else to keep me there.
- I want to write, you know.
- Oh, really?
- This is Greenwich Village, isn't it?
- Good heavens.
Do kids still come to Greenwich Village to write?
Well, isn't it cheap here?
Well, in comparison to some of the more fashionable parts of town, it is, of course.
Are you acting now?
Oh, yes. I'm in a hit too.
Uh-uh.
What's the name of it?
Star Rising. Drama of sorts.
- Can I get you a drink or something?
- Oh, no, thanks.
But I'm hungry enough to eat a bear.
Oh, well,
I guess we can do something about that.
Within a week of her arrival,
she was already on her way uptown.
- Hello. Thought you'd given us up.
- Oh, I've been busy.
Well, it's about time.
I've been getting ready to send out an expedition for you.
I've been working.
This is my brother John.
- This is Sylvia.
- Welcome to the joint, John.
- You an artist too?
- No, I'm still going to law school.
- I'm just here for a few days.
- Hey, Nanny.
Nanny, take care of Mr. and Miss Amberly.
They're old friends of mine.
Let me know if she spills anything on you, huh?
She's crazy. I spilled one drink the first day I worked here.
To hear her tell it, you'd think I was spilling things on people all the time.
- What are you, brother and sister?
- Uh-huh.
- Well, what are you gonna have?
- Well, for heaven's sakes.
I'm certainly glad to see somebody else besides myself reads Conrad.
- You, uh... You like Conrad?
- I love him.
A lot of people may think he's slow and deliberate, after the way writers move along these days, but I like that.
I like to get right in there with those people and find out what they're thinking and feeling.
- What did you say you wanted?
- I want a Bloody Mary.
Well, what on earth is that?
Vodka and tomato juice.
Haven't you ever heard of it?
No, and I hope I never do again.
What's yours? Same thing?
No, I'll just have a beer.
- Did you ever hear of a Bloody Mary?
- Certainly.
It's slop, but if that's what she wants, get it for her.
Well, it's her funeral.
- Where did you get her?
- Oh, friend of mine... a fella I used to work with in a stock company... brought her out here a couple weeks ago and asked if I could give her a job.
She's his niece. What did she do, give you some kind of an argument?
Not at all.
Just kind of natural and friendly.
She's cute too.
Her next stop, two weeks later,
was 24th Street
at the kind invitation of a new friend.
- Nanny.
- Yes?
It's John.
He's flying down this afternoon and wants to take us to dinner.
What about you?
It'll be all right, I suppose.
I was going to work, but...
- Tell him I'd love to.
- She says fine.
You sure you really want me along?
All right, all right.
Come on down whenever you get in.
- Does this bother you too?
- What?
- John and me.
- Why should it?
I'm sure you never figured on anything like that when you invited me to live here with you.
Could have happened anyway, couldn't it?
I suppose so, but...
Do you think he's really serious?
I think so. Why? Aren't you?
I don't know.
I mean, I don't know whether I should be or not.
- What do you mean?
- Oh, you know.
Your family, Boston... all that.
I can just imagine what they think of me.
What's that got to do with it?
For one thing, they're not as stuffy as all that.
For another, the only important thing in a case like this is, do you love him and does he love you?
Well, I'll tell you anyway.
I'm crazy about him.
I think he's the kindest, gentlest, most understanding person
I've ever known in my whole life.
By early May, about a month before Lottie's cocktail party,
she had reached 45th Street and the theater where Lottie was starring
in my production of Star Rising.
Excuse me.
Which way to the stage entrance?
First alley around the corner.
- I'd like to see Mr. Ling, please.
- Mr. Ling is gone already.
Oh, dear.
Did he say where he was going?
- May I ask your name?
- I'm his niece, Miss Ordway.
- Was he expecting you?
- No.
I just took a chance I could have dinner with him. Do you know where he eats?
- Good evening, Mr. Denver.
- Hiya, Fritz. How are all your ails?
Oh, just about the same, thank you, sir.
- Maybe my hips...
- Miss Marin still here?
- Yes, sir.
- Ah. Just the fellow I was looking for.
What about you and Iris for dinner with me?
Can't tonight. We're booked.
What's with Lottie?
She's eating with Alec Waterhouse.
She's going to try and steal that play from your wife.
- She can have it. Iris doesn't want it.
- Isn't it any good?
The play's all right, but he wants to do it in London.
- Iris doesn't want to go to London.
- Don't tell Lottie that.
She's all set to hijack the poor bloke.
It might break her poor little heart that she got it on the level.
I won't say a word.
Sorry about dinner, Brian.
Oh, that's all right. I'll find somebody.
Do you know where he usually eats on matinee days?
No, I don't, but maybe Mr. Mullen does.
- Where who eats?
- Mr. Ling. This is his niece.
He got out so quick she missed him.
I'm sorry, I don't know.
Oh, well. It's not too important.
- Thank you both very much.
- I'll tell him you were here.
Thanks.
I didn't know Ling had any family.
I didn't either.
Hold it a moment.
What did he do, stand you up?
Oh, no. I just took a chance.
- He didn't know I was coming.
- I'm sure he didn't.
He's far too gallant to stand anyone up, even a relative.
- You know him?
- Very well. I'm, uh...
Well, to be perfectly honest with you,
I'm Miss Carlotta Marin's husband.
- Really?
- I have a name of my own, of course, but it seems stupid to use it when I can get so much more attention simply telling whose husband I am.
- I know it.
- You do?
- Brian Mullen.
- How did you know it?
From the newspapers when you got married.
Well, I've never heard of such erudition.
- Does it really bother you that much?
- What?
- Being married to a famous star.
- Oh, not in the least. I love it.
You've no idea how many parties I get to now.
- But why do you say that?
- I think it must bother you.
You mention it so quickly and make such a joke of it.
- What are you, a psychiatrist?
- No, I'm a writer.
Then how do you know whether it bothers me or not?
Well, I don't actually.
I'm just guessing. Anyway, it shouldn't.
My guess is you do all right for yourself anyway, with or without her.
You mean you think
I have an identity of my own?
Well, I don't know, of course... but that's quite a line you've got there.
Is your name Ling too?
No, I'm Nancy Ordway.
My mother was Gordon Ling's sister.
- Do you drink?
- No.
But I'm hungry enough to eat a bear.
We'll split one.
With that background to the tragedy,
let me now pick up the story of my friendship with Nancy Ordway
ten days after our meeting at Lottie's party.
Were you drunk when you did these?
- A little.
They're very good.
Yes?
There's a Miss Ordway who wishes to speak to you on two.
- What's her name?
- Ordway. Miss Nancy Ordway.
Oh, yes. Yes, sure.
Nancy? Uh, hold it just a second, will you, honey?
- Uh, when can I, uh, get the others?
- Monday.
Yes. Monday'll be fine.
Oh, but mind, don't go on the wagon on me.
Oh, no. No.
- I'm sorry, honey.
- Am I interrupting something?
No, not a thing. How have you been?
I just called to tell you the good news.
I sold my first story today.
That's wonderful, Nancy.
How did it come out,
Somerset Maugham or Truman Capote?
Mmm. I decided not to take any chances.
I made it pure Damon Runyon from start to finish.
Well, you couldn't have done better, kid.
He's money in the bank.
Did you get my little sketch?
Oh, yes. Yes, I certainly did.
It's, uh... right here on my desk now.
It's, uh...
Yes, it's very cute.
I was hoping you might find a chance to call me sometime.
Well, I intended to, Nancy, but I've just been so busy lately,
I simply haven't had the time.
- Did Mrs. Denver get back?
- No.
They operated on her mother yesterday, so now I don't know when she'll be back.
The secret of love is greater than the secret of death.
That's the way I'd really like to write.
That sort of mood.
You're not afraid you'll be charged with frivolity?
I'll never be able to do it, I suppose.
But that's it.
That's the goal to try for... death and grandeur.
Well, you're right, of course.
Always shoot for the moon.
In a place like this with such music and such a view... space, beauty... comfort like this,
I might come close to it.
I don't suppose you'd consider renting it out by the day.
Just when you're not here.
You don't think it's a little cheerful for "The secret of love is greater than the secret of death"?
All right,
I'll change it back to comedy then.
I'm not narrow about what I write, you know.
I'll try whatever the mood is.
I take it then you weren't very much impressed with the play this evening.
Why do you say that?
It was a little too lowbrow for you, wasn't it?
I didn't mind that.
I understand the needs of the commercial theater, but I think of everything from the viewpoint of the writer.
That means I examine the psychology very closely.
Oh, I see.
That was basically a stupid idea in that play...
That a man could run around with another woman, and then find out suddenly that he was really in love with his wife all the time.
It just isn't possible with genuine people.
- Is this official?
- Really, I'm not kidding, Peter.
When you're in love, you're in love.
When you stop being in love, you stop.
You just can't start up again, like a stalled motorboat.
Why not?
Because you can't. That's why not.
You, for example.
You couldn't possibly fall out of love with Iris and then fall back in again.
Nor she with you.
But she did.
What do you mean, she did?
Exactly what you said she couldn't do.
She fell in love with another guy a few years ago, and when that turned out to be a mistake, she fell back in love with me, just like your motorboat starting up again.
And all the time you kept on being in love with her?
I did.
- Who was the man?
- Fella named Martin.
Friend of the family, of course.
But what does it matter who he was?
Did you hate him?
I think you could be safe in assuming that this didn't leave him embedded in my heart.
Well then, that doesn't prove anything, just because she says she loves you now.
I don't want to be personal, of course, but psychologically speaking,
I wouldn't be so sure that you're in love with her now.
Maybe not, but I wouldn't risk any dough on that if I were you.
And I wouldn't be at all sure that if another girl came along just as attractive...
Oh. Hello.
What is it? Wrong floor, or coming to see me?
Coming to see you, of course.
Lottie, you remember
Miss Ordway, don't you?
- Matter of fact, I met her at your party.
- Indeed I do.
You were the girl who wasn't invited.
How are you?
- Fine, thank you.
- And, uh, Mr. Mullen.
- Of course. How are you?
- How are you?
Lottie, I'm terribly sorry, but I have to take Miss Ordway home now.
Would you all like to go in and wait until I come back?
Not tonight, thanks. It was just a drop-in in case you were still up... and lonely.
What do you hear from your wife Iris?
Another two, three weeks yet.
- How'd it go tonight?
- All but the last two rows.
- Good night, Miss Ordway.
- Good night.
- See you tomorrow, Brian.
- Sure.
Odd choice, if I may be so bold.
Oh, for the love of Pete, Lottie.
- Good morning, miss.
- Good morning.
I'm Nancy Ordway.
Did Mr. Denver tell you I'd be here?
Yeah.
He told me you were gonna write here.
Well, I'm going to try anyway.
I'll be here every day until Mrs. Denver gets back.
Will I be in your way if I just stay here in this room and write?
Oh, no. I'm generally through here by 10:00 or 10:30.
I work upstairs for lunch, but if you want anything before I go, you'll find me in the bedroom or the kitchen.
Thank you. Lucia, isn't it?
Yeah, that's right. Lucia.
Iris is coming in.
I've got to meet her at 6:00.
Sure, Peter. I'll look in tomorrow, if it'll be convenient.
Tomorrow will be fine.
Did you get in touch with Miss Ordway?
Yes. I told her Mrs. Denver was coming back today and that you'd get in touch with her in a couple of days.
Fine.
Said she understood, and for me to thank you.
I'll see you tomorrow, Gordon.
Uh, did he say Miss Ordway?
Yeah. She's a young writer he picked up somewhere.
She's been working in the apartment for the past few weeks.
Sounds goofy to me, but you know what a soft touch Peter is.
Why? Do you know her?
No. No, I guess not.
- Hiya, honey.
- Hiya, darling.
What about the show?
Holding up very well.
In fact, it looks now as if it might run into next season.
Lottie behaving herself?
Well, I think I'm the only one around the theater still speaking to her, but nobody's actually clobbered her yet.
- Poor Brian.
- If he doesn't like that sort of thing, he should never have said yes.
Oh, for heaven's sakes.
You haven't let Lottie put on some frightful homecoming production, have you?
No, I'm afraid we've still got
Miss Ordway with us.
Who's Miss Ordway?
You remember I told you I took this kid out to dinner the day you left?
Oh, yes.
Well, I've been letting her work here during the day.
She's a writer.
She's supposed to be gone.
I'll, uh... I'll tell you about it later.
What does she do, write in the dark?
She's a nut about that piece.
She must be a nut about other things too.
"The secret of love is greater than the secret of death."
Maybe she's in the kitchen.
- She must be in the bathroom.
- I'll get her.
What is it?
What's the matter, honey?
Hey, what's the matter? Can't you pull that sheet back off her face?
Hold it. Hold it. Hold it.
Hold it now. Hold it.
Thank you.
How did she happen to be here in this apartment?
I gave her a key.
She said where she lived wasn't very cheerful for writing, so when she asked if she could work here during the day, I said okay.
- How long ago was that?
- Something like two weeks ago.
And how long had you known her?
Two, three weeks before that.
He met her June 6, the day I left for New Orleans.
He told me about it on the phone that night.
Where did you meet her,
Mr. Denver?
- Upstairs, at a party at Carlotta Marin's.
- The actress?
That's right. She's in a show of mine.
Was she a friend of Miss Marin's?
No, she came to the party with another girl.
I don't know who the other girl was.
I never met her.
- Did you see much of her after that?
- Not a great deal, no.
We had dinner together that night and a couple of other nights.
Now and then
I'd talk to her on the phone.
Did you know anything about her family?
All I know is that she said she came from Savannah, Georgia and that her mother and father were both dead.
What do you make of this?
That's a quotation from the opera Salome.
She was writing a story around that theme,
I believe.
Why the drawing? I don't know, except that she often left drawings like that around with some kind of a facetious comment on them.
I don't know what to make of that one.
You think it was meant as a suicide note?
I suppose so, if you want to take it that way.
- But how else could you take it?
- I don't know.
I don't know what she might have meant by it.
Well, if we take it for the moment as a suicide note, wouldn't that suggest something else to you?
What?
Wouldn't that suggest that there was something more than a casual relationship between you?
I don't care what it suggests to you.
The fact remains that I had no romantic interest in Miss Ordway, nor the slightest reason to suspect that she had any in me.
And in case there's any doubt about it,
Lieutenant,
I think you ought to know that Mr. Denver and I are not members of a giddy nightclub set who run around having casual affairs with other members of the group.
We've been married for seven years, and if you'll forgive an old-fashioned expression, we're still in love with each other.
I'll try and keep that in mind,
Mrs. Denver.
You said there were other drawings like this.
- Where are they?
- I threw 'em out, I suppose.
I can't remember.
Oh, wait a minute.
Yes, here's one.
This is the first one
I ever got from her.
That's how she reminded me of her phone number.
I'll keep this one for the time being.
Now, if we dismiss the idea of a romance between you, what other motive can you think of for what she did?
Well, she was almost unbelievably serious about her writing.
She might have been discouraged about that.
- But why in your apartment?
- I don't know.
- You can't even suggest a possibility?
- No, I can't.
Did she ever strike you as a neurotic?
Not much more than the rest of us, no.
- Reasonably normal?
- So she seemed to me.
Then if you can't think of anything else at the moment...
Will you stop this silly imitation
of Dragnet and let me in?
Let her in.
What is it, Peter?
Miss Ordway killed herself here this afternoon.
Do you mean that child you met at my party?
That's the one.
Oh, good heavens.
Iris, you poor thing.
Well, how did she do it?
She hanged herself.
- She was insane.
- Why do you say that?
To hang herself when she could have used pills. Who are you?
Lieutenant Bruce is a detective.
- Miss Carlotta Marin, Lieutenant.
- I recognize Miss Marin.
How do you do?
We won't stay, darling.
I know this is no time for that.
- But may I say one thing to you?
- Of course.
Without knowing anything else about the case,
I can just imagine the first thought that came into your mind when you heard what had happened.
But it's not true.
Not possibly.
To put the kindest face possible on it, the girl was a little horror... a transparent, syrupy little phony with about as much to offer a man as Cuckoo the Bird Girl.
Not even Peter, with all of his radiant innocence about women, could have been stirred for one instant by that dingy little creep.
Lottie, the girl is dead.
I know, and that's precisely why
I refuse to speak harshly of her.
But you and Iris are my friends, and I refuse also to remain silent when a thoroughly tragic misunderstanding is possible here.
Well, isn't that so, Officer?
I hope not, of course.
Well, then believe what I'm telling you.
I know exactly what's in your mind, and it's utter nonsense.
Stick to it, and you can only wind up by making a public spectacle of yourself.
- Thanks for the tip, ma'am.
- And don't you worry either, darling.
I'll explain the whole thing to Iris.
Call me the minute these people are out of here.
Come along, darling.
A very forceful woman.
One more thing, Mr. Denver.
I wonder if you could tell me where you were this afternoon before you went to meet Mrs. Denver.
- I went to a movie.
- Which one?
It was an old picture at the Star Theater on 42nd Street.
I'm casting a play now. There was a Hollywood actor in it I wanted to see.
What was the name of it?
The Girl in the Window.
- Anybody with you?
- No, I went alone.
Did you see anybody that you knew, or might know you?
No.
Thanks.
- Good night, Mrs. Denver.
- Good night.
Come here, dear.
Sit here.
Was that the truth?
That was the truth, all right, but I'm beginning to wonder who's going to believe it.
Well, I am, for one.
Do you mind Mrs. Denver being here?
Not if you don't. Come in, Mrs. Denver.
- Thank you.
- Sit down.
We were just wondering if you had anything to add from what you told us last night.
No, not that I can think of.
Too bad about the fuss it's kicking up in the papers.
But that's one of the penalties of fame,
I suppose.
Send in Miss Colletti.
- Miss Colletti?
- Lucia.
- Oh, of course.
- You're on friendly terms, aren't you?
Quite. We're very fond of her.
There's no reason to assume a grudge or anything like that?
- No, not that I know of.
- Come in, Mrs. Colletti.
- I'm sorry, Mrs. Denver.
- That's all right. We understand, Lucia.
You're Mrs. Lucia Colletti. You work as a part-time maid for Mr. and Mrs. Denver and also for
Mr. and Mrs. Brian Mullen in an apartment upstairs in the same building.
Mrs. Mullen being better known as Miss Carlotta Marin.
- Is that correct?
- Yes, sir.
Did you tell us last night that Mr. Denver once gave you $10 not to mention Miss Ordway's presence in Mr. Denver's apartment?
I'll answer that. I did.
But it was only not to mention it to Miss Marin, who is a foolish gossip and a mischief maker.
I didn't care to have Miss Marin make a scandalous story out of an innocent, if possibly stupid, arrangement.
I thought you and Miss Marin were very good friends.
Not really.
She likes Mrs. Denver, I believe, after her fashion, but I'm sure she loathes me.
For any particular reason?
I'm her employer.
How often did you see Miss Ordway in Mr. Denver's apartment?
- Every day, sir.
- And what was she doing there?
Writing on the typewriter.
And how was she dressed?
Always, sir.
Uh, except that once.
Do you mind telling us again about that once?
Once she was asleep in the bed.
Whose bed?
One of the beds in the bedroom.
What was she wearing that morning?
- Pajamas, sir.
- Whose?
- Mrs. Denver's, sir.
- Was she alone?
Oh, yes, sir.
That's all, Mrs. Colletti.
Thank you very much.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Denver.
I had to tell them.
That's all right.
I understand.
So all right, she took a nap one morning.
What does that prove?
Send Miss Amberly in.
You know who Miss Amberly is, don't you?
No.
She's the young lady that lived with Miss Ordway.
Mr. and Mrs. Denver, Miss Amberly.
- Sit down, won't you?
- No, thanks.
You don't mind going over some of the same ground of your story as you did last night, do you?
Not at all. Anything you want.
Well, from what Miss Ordway told you, what was your impression of the relationship between her and Mr. Denver?
It was not simply an impression.
Nanny told me what it was in so many words.
She was in love with him, and he was in love with her.
- Now, just a...
- Don't interrupt, Mr. Denver.
I want you to hear what she's got to say first.
Then you can talk if you want to.
Did Miss Ordway know that Mr. Denver was a married man?
Of course.
That was the tragedy of it.
But you understood from her he promised at last to divorce his wife?
That's what he told her, but I warned her then he'd never do it.
This woman must be out of her mind.
I don't know whether these are
Nancy Ordway's lies or her own, but every word she's uttered is a lie.
And from your talks with her, were you able to decide for yourself whether this relationship was platonic or not?
It wasn't necessary for me to decide for myself.
Nanny told me the whole sordid story.
It was not.
That's all, Miss Amberly.
Thank you very much.
No. No, that is not all.
Just one minute, Miss...
But you're not gonna let her get away with that.
Get away with what?
You just let that woman accuse me of seducing a girl, make a false promise of marriage, and then drive her to suicide without giving me the slightest opportunity to come back at her.
- Now, is that what you call a fair shake?
- But you deny it all, don't you?
Of course I deny it all because it isn't true, not one word of it.
Then can you offer a suggestion why either she or Miss Ordway should make up such a story if it weren't true?
Well, obviously, the woman is a neurotic.
I can't even understand your listening to such a lunatic.
We have to listen to everything that has a bearing on an unnatural death, Mr. Denver.
That's our job.
Is it a crime to have known a girl that killed herself?
No.
Then what's the reason for all this gumshoe work, dragging in all these people to blacken me in this case?
- Oh, that was your idea.
- What do you mean?
Suicides are almost invariably neurotics of one kind or another, but you insist that this girl was quite normal.
And there was no reason for her to kill herself because of you or in your apartment, so obviously we gotta look further for the explanation.
- Is there anything else?
- Not now.
I'll call you if there is.
The time of her death, in case you're interested, was between 2:30 and 4:00 in the afternoon.
Thanks.
- Do you want to go home?
- I suppose so.
Sixty-seventh and Fifth.
- And where are you going?
- The office first.
I'll be home around 6:00 or so.
I don't want to be troublesome,
Miss Amberly, but I've got to know something more about that story you told the police.
I have nothing whatever to say to you, so will you please get out?
- Mr. Denver?
- Will you make him leave, John?
Who are you?
I'm her brother, John Amberly.
What do you want?
I want to know why your sister lied about me this morning.
- I did not lie.
- Then Miss Ordway lied to you,
Miss Amberly, if that's where you got your story, because there's not one word of truth in it.
Now, why do you think she did that?
- You're Peter Denver, aren't you?
- Of course.
- Husband of the celebrated Iris Denver?
- I am.
Then she didn't lie about it.
Well, then will you at least tell me where you met her, or who introduced her to you?
She was a waitress at Sylvia's over on 17th near Eighth Avenue.
- What's that got to do with it?
- Where was she living then?
With some other girl.
I don't know who.
Why do you answer him?
He has no right to ask us questions.
Are you going to get out, or do you want me to call the police?
I wish you'd try to understand my position, Miss Amberly.
No matter what she told you,
I was nothing whatever to Nancy Ordway.
Nothing whatever.
My life's being chewed up here without my having the slightest idea how or why.
That's really wonderful.
Your life's being chewed up.
And what about his?
I suppose that's nothing.
I don't know what she's talking about.
I loved her.
I wanted her to marry me.
And she would have too, if it hadn't been for you.
Did she tell you that?
No, that's what she told my sister.
- Is that true, Miss Amberly?
- It is.
Now I've asked you for the last time.
Are you going to get out, or shall I call the police?
Well, if you don't mind my saying so,
I'm very sorry for you too, Mr. Amberly.
Oh, I'm sure there's a perfectly innocent explanation for this.
After all, the girl was alone in the apartment, and she may very well have decided to simply sleep instead of work that morning.
Not an altogether unnatural choice, if you ask me.
But what about that other woman?
I have a confession to make to you, Iris.
I lied to that detective last night.
I was giving Peter the benefit of the doubt.
But after what you've heard this morning,
I see no further need of trying to protect him.
- I've known all along about that girl.
- Have you really?
I saw her in and out of this building a dozen times, day and night.
Not that I placed any evil construction on it then, but now I find myself quite unable to continue thinking of them as two young music lovers listening steadily to the phonograph for something like six weeks.
Well, I still can't believe it.
Now, there's no one in the world fonder of Peter than I am, but if I were in your place... and believe me,
I say this for your own good...
We, uh, just dropped in to see if there was anything new.
- Good of you.
- Thank you, darling.
Honey.
Now what was it you were going to tell Iris for her own good, may I ask?
Can you really hear through the keyhole of a Yale lock?
The organ tones of an old-fashioned actress, yes.
I have no objection your knowing what I was going to tell my friend.
I was going to suggest to her that she move out of this place.
- Why?
- You're not that obtuse.
All right, then I'm going to take the liberty of making a suggestion to you.
From now on, would you be good enough to keep your advice to yourself?
Now, Peter, please.
I don't see how you could take a wiser position after all that's gone on in this apartment
- while your wife was away.
- Oh, cut that out, Lottie.
In fact, it might be just as well if you never came in here again.
Look, both of you,
I know we're all upset and all that, but don't let's say anything we'll be sorry for later.
Ever since she moved into this building, she's been poking her nose into my business, and I'm sick of it.
Now get out and stay out.
With the greatest of pleasure,
Mr. Denver.
Out of here and out of your theater too.
Oh, don't be a fool, Lottie.
We'll see who the fool is when our young hero tries to raise the curtain tomorrow night.
Ring for the elevator, will you?
- Don't take that too seriously, Peter.
- Oh, forget it.
I don't care whether she ever plays again or not.
She doesn't mean it, really.
She just flew off the handle for a moment.
In her heart, she's for both of you, believe me.
Like this afternoon when that detective was prying around upstairs...
- not one word out of her.
- Come on, will you?
I'm coming.
You, uh, heard the girl was pregnant, didn't you?
No, I didn't.
That cop told us this afternoon.
Anything else?
Nothing to top that.
Think you'd like to go out for dinner?
Listen to this.
"My dear Iris.
We've talked of you so often and with such sympathy,
I'm sure you won't mind my calling you Iris."
Who's it from?
From Nanny. Nanny Ordway.
"Nevertheless, this is not an easy letter to write, as you can well imagine.
But since Peter's already told you what has happened to us,
I feel I must add something by way of explaining Peter's side of the case."
- Let me see that.
- Let me see it first, if you don't mind.
"You must understand that he was no more to blame he had no more control over his emotions than you had when you realized you'd lost your heart to Martin."
How could you have told her that?
But I didn't.
Not like that, I mean.
I-I never told her one thing...
Oh, Peter, please.
Don't talk to me as if I were an idiot.
- Where else would she have got the name?
- Will you let me explain?
What did you do, just sit here and tell her everything about you and me?
No, no, of course not. What she's done...
She's taken one stupid, foolish remark and built it into this impossible lie.
Everybody's lying but you.
Lucia, that other woman,
Nanny Ordway... they're all lying but you.
But it's the truth, darling.
I swear it.
- Please.
- What are you gonna do?
I don't know.
Except I... I can't stay here any longer.
Well, she's gone.
- Oh, no.
- Mmm. Cook just told me.
- Where'd she go?
- Who knows?
Poor Peter.
Yes, indeedy.
My heart just bleeds for him.
Don't you think you're being a bit unfair to him?
Do you think so, really?
Well, you have no proof of anything, have you?
Do you think it was all right for him to go running around with another woman?
Well, I have no reason to think it was all wrong.
Would you do it?
Ah, well, that's a somewhat different situation.
In what way?
Because, after all, you and I have an understanding.
What sort of understanding, may I ask?
You know. The understanding that if ever you catch me with another woman, you'll break my neck.
- You object to that?
- Of course not.
You better not.
You want me to pick you up after the show?
What show?
- You weren't serious about that, were you?
- Indeed I was.
I'm through with Mr. Peter Denver forever, and that's final.
But you've got a contract, darling.
You can't just walk out like that.
I can if Dr. Harstone advises it for the sake of my health, can't I?
- Oh, hello, Lieutenant.
- Mr. Mullen.
Do you have any idea where we might be able to find Mrs. Denver?
There's no answer at her apartment.
No, I haven't seen either of them today.
Isn't this apartment identical with theirs?
Yes, except that we have a terrace and they don't.
- May I see the arrangement?
- Of course. Come in.
- Sergeant Welch, Mr. Brian Mullen.
- How do you do?
- How do you do?
- It's just a matter of measurements, and if these rooms are identical,
I guess this is just as good as the other.
Is it all right if he goes into the bedroom?
Of course. The maid hasn't been in yet, but, um, right straight through.
But don't you dare tell her I let anybody in there before it was straightened up.
Cops don't matter.
May I see the kitchen arrangement?
Certainly.
It's just this dining room.
This is the breakfast room.
And this is the kitchen.
And it's exactly the same in the apartment downstairs?
Except for the furniture.
Is this anything?
Oh, no, that's just some doodles my wife makes when she's phoning.
Would you answer one or two questions strictly off the record?
I'll try.
What do you think of Denver's story?
I don't know. I can't figure it.
This is entirely confidential, you understand.
I understand.
What was his reputation about women?
Very good, so far as I know.
- No chasing?
- I've never known of any.
You think he'd be capable of murder?
Murder? Why murder?
Look, as it turns out, the girl didn't kill herself.
She was murdered... choked to death and then strung up.
We just got the report.
Oh, no.
Do you think he could have done it?
I don't think so.
Well, what about the evidence against him?
I just can't see Peter doing a thing like that.
There's nothing official about this, you understand.
We're just talking off the record.
But sometimes you have a feeling about a person that you know very well that either he is capable of killing somebody or he isn't.
It's just a feeling, but occasionally I've found it has a definite bearing on the truth.
Is he charged with it?
Well, we can't very well dismiss the evidence, can we?
This about it?
And, uh, what if he could prove that he was at that movie at the time the girl was killed?
To tell you the truth, Mr. Mullen,
I've rarely met a murderer who wasn't at a movie at the time of the murder.
I hope you'll remember, please, that this was strictly between ourselves.
I won't mention it, and I'd rather you didn't, if you don't mind.
I understand.
We're all after the same thing, of course... the truth.
And every little bit helps, you know.
Well, I just can't believe it about Peter. That's all.
- Thanks anyway.
- Glad to meet you, Mr. Marin.
- Mullen.
- Oh, that's all right. I'm used to that.
- Yeah?
- Mr. Mullen on two.
- Brian?
- Have you heard from the police yet?
Nothing new.
Why?
I've got some very bad news for you,
Peter.
Nanny didn't kill herself.
She was murdered.
Who said she was?
That Detective Bruce was up here just now and told me.
Had a report from the autopsy.
Obviously, they're gonna try and pin it on you.
You mean arrest me?
I suppose so.
That's the usual routine, isn't it?
Have you got a lawyer?
Just a minute. Yes?
Sergeant Owens from the police is here to see you.
Okay. Uh, just hold it a minute, will you?
Take a glance.
Lieutenant Bruce speaking.
Sergeant Owens, Lieutenant.
- The so-and-so powdered out on us.
- You're kidding.
Without even asking us what we wanted.
- What was he wearing?
- What was the man wearing?
Dark slacks.
- Yeah.
- Light, checked sports jacket.
- Yeah.
- Gray hat.
All cars, especially cars in the vicinity of Times Square, be on the lookout for Peter Denver.
Wanted for questioning in homicide.
Denver, about 36, 180 pounds, wearing dark slacks, light, checked sports jacket.
- Hello?
- Brian?
- We got cut off.
- Are you alone?
- Yes.
- Well, they came for me, but I got out.
If they lock me up now, I'm a dead duck.
Can you stay by that phone for a while?
Of course, but are you sure you should have done that?
I don't now, but it's a cinch
I'm not gonna be able to do anything for myself if I'm in the Tombs.
I've got to dig into this thing while I can.
All right.
Well, what do you want me to do?
Nothing. Just stand by in case I need to get in touch with somebody.
- Okay. I'll be here.
- I'll call you later.
- Who is it?
- Lieutenant Bruce, Miss Amberly.
Let me go!
Try to scream, you're gonna get hurt.
You understand?
- Please!
- Do you understand what I said?
- Yes.
- I don't know whether you know it or not, but Nancy Ordway was murdered, and they're trying to hang it on me.
So you can figure out for yourself whether I mean this or not.
- You let me go!
- Are you gonna keep quiet?
- You've got no right...
- Are you gonna keep quiet or not?
- Yes.
- All right.
But don't kid yourself.
You make one sound, and you're gonna be sorry for it.
You understand that?
Now I want you to tell me something, and I want the truth too.
When did that girl first tell you about me?
You killed her.
Answer me, you idiot! When did that girl first tell you about me?
- Please!
- Then answer me.
It was the day John asked her to marry him. She told me that night.
When was that? How long ago?
June 2. It was on his birthday.
What makes you so sure of that?
That's when he asked her... the day he was 21.
And that same night, she told you about this other man?
Yes. But I'd already guessed some of it.
What had you already guessed?
That she was in love with somebody... a married man probably.
She was so unhappy about it.
How long had you guessed that?
I don't know. Several weeks I suppose.
And that same night, she told you that it was me?
She did.
What did she say exactly?
That you were in love.
That you were married.
You didn't think your wife would give you a divorce.
Did she tell you then that she was gonna have a child?
No. Not then.
When did she tell you that?
Last Tuesday... the day before you killed her.
How long had she been pregnant?
I don't know. She didn't say.
I don't know whether to break your neck or not, but you're lying to me and I know it.
But I'm not. I swear it, I tell you.
- Where's your brother?
- Back at school.
All right, stop worrying.
I'm not gonna do anything to you now.
But remember this.
If you tell the police about this,
I'll get you if it's the last thing
I ever do.
That girl's got me in a box here.
And apparently no one's gonna help me out of it but myself.
So you think twice before you decide to do anything foolish.
Operator, get me the police, quick.
Hold it here a minute.
When does this place open?
Don't open anymore. Closed up.
- You mean for good?
- Yeah. The cops took up their license.
Who do you want there?
Well, I left a raincoat in there the other night, and I'd like to get it back if I could.
- You want to see Anne about that.
- Who's Anne?
The checkroom girl.
Look, you go around there on Eighth Avenue on the west side next to the corner, and it's a bar and grill.
- She's workin' there now.
- Thank you.
I beg your pardon. You Anne?
Yeah.
Can I talk to you alone a few minutes?
- What about?
- Nancy Ordway.
- Oh, you're Peter Denver, aren't you?
- Yeah.
I saw your picture in the paper.
- Charlie.
- Yeah?
This is a fella who wants to talk to me about Nancy Ordway.
- Okay.
- Okay.
Looks like you're in quite a jam.
It's worse than that.
Now they say that it wasn't suicide.
- I could've told you that from the start.
- How?
Girls like that don't kill themselves.
They're too busy for that.
What do you mean "busy"?
Gettin' on in the world, butterin' up to people.
- You know what she did one night?
- Huh?
Humphrey Bogart came in the place.
She gave me two bucks to let her help him put his coat on.
- You know the Amberlys?
- Yes.
Well, look at the way she went after them.
That's the way she went after everybody.
I certainly don't want to speak disrespectfully of the dead, but that Nanny was strictly a purpose girl.
Do you think she was hustling the Amberlys?
What else? Big rich family in Boston, social register, nice unmarried boy.
That was a big deal for her until you came along.
- But why me?
- Why not?
You're a big character... famous, plenty of dough.
Why take the kid if she could get you?
- But I wasn't interested in her.
- Oh, weren't you?
Not in the way everybody thinks.
What was it then, a shakedown?
I suppose so, but I can't tell you how.
She was gonna have a baby, you know.
- Wasn't yours?
- No, I'm just the chump she hung it on.
- Well, then whose was it?
- That's what I'm tryin' to find out now.
Did she have any other boyfriends that you might know about?
That I couldn't tell you.
Oh, she had 'em, all right, but somewhere else, away from the joint.
That's all I ever saw, was her in the joint.
What about this girl that she lived with before she moved in with the Amberlys?
That wasn't any girl she lived with.
That was a fella.
I forgot about him.
- Are you sure about that?
- I'm positive.
I took her paycheck there once, and it was his place.
- He answered the door.
- Can you remember that address?
Matter of fact, I can.
Ninety-nine West Ninth.
Three nines in a row.
You don't know his name though?
No, I can't remember that.
Just that he was gray-haired and quite a good-looking guy.
Mm-hmm.
Well, that's something worth shooting at anyway. Thank you very much, Anne.
- Cops after you for it?
- I guess so, by now.
Well, don't worry. I never saw you.
No, don't do that.
Don't get yourself mixed up in this.
If they ask you, you just tell
'em exactly what you've told me.
Okay then, if that's the way you want it.
May I come in?
Certainly, Peter.
- You've come about Nanny I suppose.
- You bet I have.
And I think you ought to know that the police are coming down here too.
That fellow Bruce, that detective... he talked to Sylvia on the coast.
She told him that I was Nanny's uncle.
- You're Nanny's uncle?
- She's my sister's child.
Then why didn't you say so before?
- I assumed that you knew that anyway.
- Well, I didn't.
So what else you been holding back?
I don't know how you want me to answer that, Peter.
You knew she had a lover, didn't you?
- Yes, I knew it.
- You know who he was?
- Yes.
- Well, who?
I'm not gonna argue with you about this, Gordon.
Now, if she had a lover, that's the man that killed her. And I want his name.
Now let's have it.
- Killed her?
- That's right, killed her.
She was murdered.
Now is that clear to you?
Oh, good heavens.
Oh, no, Peter. Oh, it can't be.
Who was he?
- Oh, please, Peter.
- Who was he? Tell me.
Well, she told me it was you.
Gordon, you're lying to me.
That's what she said. I swear it.
When did she say that?
- The day... The day before she died.
- What else did she say?
She told me everything.
She told me the whole story.
All right, then suppose you tell it to me.
Well, I knew that she'd been bringing somebody here when I was out.
She still had a key to the place.
But I had no idea who it was until that day she came here crying and half out of her mind.
And then she told me the whole story.
And she actually said me by name?
Yes.
Uh, not at first, but, uh...
Who did she say at first?
Well, I meant she didn't say any names first.
She was pretty hysterical, you understand.
And even when she went on about this man and about his being married to a famous wife and all, and what a fight she'd probably make against a divorce...
Even then it wasn't until she said Iris... that I realized you were the one she was talking about.
And then when I heard she was dead in your apartment...
Well, it was then I decided not to say anything to anybody.
Just, uh... Just tell me one more thing.
Whatever I can, Peter.
You say, at first, that you didn't realize she meant me.
Who did you think she meant at first?
- Why, as a matter of fact...
- Is that them?
- I suppose so.
- How do I get out of here?
- You're not gonna run away, are you?
Is there a door at the back of this hall?
Yes, but don't you think that's rather foolish?
They're bound to catch you sooner or later.
- May we come in?
- Right in here.
- Can I, uh, fix you a drink?
- No, thanks.
- We'd just like to ask you one question.
- Yes?
We'd like for you to tell us everything you just told Mr. Denver.
Oh, darling. Oh, I'm so sorry.
That's all right, honey.
Miss Mills just told me, but neither of us knew where to look for you.
She tell you what they say now?
What idiocy.
You may be dumb about some things, but you're not dumb enough to kill someone in your own apartment and then leave her there.
Then all I've got to do now is sell that to the cops.
Have you any idea yet?
Yeah. A very good idea.
- Who?
- I think it was Brian.
- Brian?
- That's who I think it was.
But Brian's such a nothing.
I don't know, of course, but
I've been slamming around town like a TV detective, and that's the way it looks to me.
All I can prove though is that I wasn't her sweetie.
How can you prove that?
Because she was talkin' about this guy on June 2, and I hadn't even met her on June 2.
I never met her until the day you left town, which was June 6, remember?
- Did Brian know her then?
- That I don't know either.
But she was already talking about a famous wife.
And then just about 10 minutes ago, it finally began to trickle into this thick skull of mine that I'm not the only character around town with a celebrated wife.
Well, then that's it, isn't it?
For me maybe, but not for the police, I'm afraid.
Not yet anyway.
No, what I...
I really think I better do now is...
What?
You feel like helping me a bit with this?
You name it, honey.
I want Lottie out of their apartment for about an hour or so so I can have a little talk with Brian.
Think you can manage that?
You watch and wait and see.
Hello?
Hello. Is Lottie there, Brian?
Right here, darling.
How are you?
I'm all right. Thank you.
Will you put her on, please?
Of course, darling.
Just one moment.
Poor Lottie.
Iris, darling, where are you?
Are you doing anything important right now?
I'll be right over.
Where are you?
Well, I'll be back at my hotel.
I'm at the Grenada.
- In 15 minutes?
- I'll be there.
I've been wanting to talk to you all day.
What's the room?
Room 411.
Oh. Come in.
Lottie just went out... to see Iris, as a matter of fact.
I know. I asked Iris to call her.
Oh, really? Would you like a drink?
No, thanks. Not now.
I've just been talking to Gordon.
Gordon Ling?
He told me about you and Nanny.
Who told him?
He just put two and two together.
Is that what Iris is gonna tell Lottie?
No, but I'd like you to tell me about it, if you don't mind.
I'm terribly sorry, Peter.
I'm sure you are, but that's not gonna be enough this time.
I'm being chased for murder, remember?
I was just too scared to say anything at all.
And it wasn't murder then, you know, and you were already in it.
Go on.
You don't know what it means to be married to a woman like Lottie, but I'll tell you this.
It's pretty lonely at times.
Pretty humiliating too, when you let yourself think about it.
"Rich actress's kept husband," and all that sort of talk.
Get on with it, will you?
And so when this thing started with Nanny, it was a new kind of life for me... loved like that, and being treated with, really, respect.
You know what I mean?
I know what you mean. Go on.
It was really pretty wonderful, and then, all of a sudden I realized that this girl was almost literally insane about me.
It was no use trying to make her understand that I couldn't get a divorce from Lottie.
Not that I wanted one, to tell the truth.
But even if I had, Lottie would never have gone for a deal like that in a thousand years, and I knew it.
So I told her that even if
I was able to find a way out, how was I going to support her?
I've never been able to make a decent living, Peter.
I don't kid myself about that.
I'm a hitchhiker.
Without Lottie,
I'd be doing good not to starve.
You know that as well as I do.
So what did you do?
Are you sure you want me to go on about this, Peter?
Why not?
Well, then she started to threaten me.
She was going to tell Lottie.
That's when I really began to get panicky.
- About the baby?
- Well, that's the strange part of it.
I didn't know anything about the baby until that afternoon.
What afternoon?
That afternoon in your apartment.
What happened then?
Well, it was about 2:00 when she called me.
Lottie was out, thank heavens, at the photographer's.
Are you alone?
Yes, but you shouldn't call me in the daytime. I've asked you.
I won't do it again, but I had to this time.
I've got something very wonderful to tell you.
Will you come down here?
- Now look, dear...
- Please, darling.
This is very dangerous, you know.
Now stop worrying.
Lucia's gone and Peter won't be back until 6:00.
This may be the very last time we'll have to sneak around and be scared like this.
Because I've fixed it so we can be married.
You do love me, don't you?
You know I do, darling, but I've told you how impossible it is.
Then it's got to be done, Brian, because we're going to have a child.
I'd do anything on earth...
I'd give half my life if I could make you as happy about it as I am.
Nanny, darling, if only there was some reasonable way for us...
- But there is now, if you love me enough.
- How?
Because I'm going to get some money... so much money that you'll be able to leave that woman, and then never have to worry about that part of it again.
- Well, what do you mean?
- I'm going to get it from Peter.
I'm going to send a lawyer to him about our child.
Are you joking?
Of course not.
Peter's rich.
Don't you think it would be worth $50,000 to him to keep a story like that out of the papers?
You must be joking.
Don't you want to marry me?
I do, darling, but what you're saying is insane.
Why is it?
Well, for one thing, you'd never get away with it.
But it's already fixed, I tell you.
Claire Amberly knows it,
Uncle Gordon knows it, and I've even written to his wife and told her about it.
Well, this is really crazy.
Peter's my friend.
He's been your friend. How could you...
Do you mean you're more concerned about him than you are about me?
Well, that's not it at all.
It's just that you simply can't do this to a perfectly decent, innocent person.
Then what would you say if I sent the lawyer to you?
- Now listen, darling...
- How would you like that in the papers?
"Carlotta Marin's Husband
Father's Girl's Child."
- Think you'd like that better?
- Don't be a fool. All I'm trying to tell...
All you're trying to tell me is you want to leave me this way!
You want everyone in the building to hear you?
You bet I do!
I want everybody in the world...
Very clever, Mr. Denver.
It's just too bad your wife wasn't actress enough to carry it off.
What's he trying to pull over here?
Go on, tell her.
I couldn't help it, darling.
The girl was murdered.
I don't believe it.
It's true nevertheless, Miss Marin.
Then why don't you arrest him?
- Arrest who?
- Who do you think?
I think first I'd like to hear the rest of Mr. Mullen's story.
Sergeant Welch, who has an old-fashioned approach to criminal investigation, was thoughtful enough to leave this little mike here this afternoon, so we were able to listen to the first part of it in the office downstairs.
Can I persuade you to continue with it now?
What's he talking about?
Mr. Mullen was tellin' us about a discussion he had with Miss Ordway the other afternoon in the Denver apartment.
According to this version, she wanted to blame their baby on Mr. Denver...
an idea to which Mr. Mullen said he objected.
It's not true.
Will you go on from there?
She quieted down then, but she still insisted on that insane idea.
Whichever you wish.
I can send the lawyer to him or to you.
- I don't care which.
- But it can't be done that way, Nanny.
Either way, you'll bring the whole house down on everybody.
Nobody wins. We've got to find some sensible way out of this thing.
All right, then you suggest one.
That's impossible right this moment. You have to give me time to think about it.
- How much time?
- How can I answer that either?
Don't you think it'd be better in any case to wait until we're less upset emotionally and then try to find a way out calmly?
All right. I'll give you exactly
15 minutes... until 3:00.
And then you can tell me whom you want the lawyer to go to.
Please, Nanny, you're behaving like an idiot.
- Let me in. Let me in.
- Yes?
- Well, are you going to answer me or not?
Look, darling...
Look, Brian,
I don't want to argue anymore with you.
All I want to know is if you're with me or not.
Yes, I'm with you.
Oh, darling, I'm so glad.
I can't tell you how glad I am.
You do love me, don't you?
I do.
And think what it'll do for us, darling.
You'll be free. We'll have more money than we can possibly need.
And we'll have a home together with our child.
Doesn't that sound worth anything we have to do to get it?
I suppose so, but...
But they can stand it, darling.
They're rich and famous and important.
We're not.
Oh, they've got other things to make up for a little trouble.
Maybe it'll bother 'em for a week or two or even a month, but then it'll all be over for them.
They've got other interests.
Peter will make the money back.
Meantime, look what it'll do for us.
Can't you think of it that way for just a little while?
I'll try.
Will you come down here now?
I can't now.
I'm expecting Lottie back about 3:30.
- Just for a few minutes.
- No. I'll call you tomorrow.
Please, darling.
All right then, but just for a few minutes.
Just tap at the door.
All right.
Go on.
That's all there was to it.
- You mean that's all you're gonna tell us?
- Nothing more to tell.
While I was getting up enough courage to go down and see her, Lottie came in.
I'm sorry, darling.
It's a very extraordinary story,
Mr. Mullen.
It's the truth.
Downstairs all alone in an apartment was a young woman who was threatening to expose you to your wife as the father of her child.
A few hours later she's found dead... murdered.
Do you know all you need to establish a case for murder?
I didn't kill her, I tell you.
You only need two things... a motive and an opportunity.
You're a man of intelligence, so I invite you to examine your own story in the light of those two facts.
I didn't do it. I don't know who did it, but I didn't do it.
Then suppose we offered this case as we have it now to a court and jury.
- How would you disprove it?
- I don't know, but I didn't do it.
The truth is that you did go back down there, didn't you?
I didn't.
You didn't go back and try to persuade her again to drop her threats?
I wanted to, but I didn't.
I... I hadn't got the guts.
You didn't stop her screams this time with hands on her throat until she was dead?
- As God is my judge, I...
- Then who do you think did, Mr. Mullen?
Didn't Peter?
What makes you think that?
Well, I took it for granted he came home unexpectedly and she told him what she was going to do.
Have you any evidence of any kind to support that suggestion?
I have.
What sort of evidence, Miss Marin?
Everybody's known about Peter and the girl for weeks.
But he was a friend of mine.
Is that why you accused him of the murder twice already?
I accused him because I knew you had nothing actual against him.
It's better that I be set down as a wicked, jealous, spiteful woman than that...
Than that your husband should be suspected?
Yes.
You mean you knew about your husband and the girl?
No.
Not until just now.
I knew there was someone, but I had no idea it was her.
I thought she was Peter's girl.
I knew nothing about Brian and her.
But that's not evidence, Miss Marin.
Is that all you've got to tell us?
No. I was willing to keep quiet for Mr. Denver's sake... for the sake of anyone who has been as close to me
as he and Mrs. Denver have been.
But not at the risk of my husband's life, regardless of what he's done to me.
He's hurt me,
he's destroyed my love and happiness, but he's still not a murderer.
Go on.
I came home that afternoon from the photographer's around 3:00 with the proofs of the pictures that Mr. Denver had ordered.
I knew he was anxious to see them as soon as possible,
so I decided to stop off at his apartment
in case he should be there to show them to him.
Let go, Peter! Let me go!
I'll let you go when you come to your senses!
Help, police! Police!
- And that was a little after 3:00 you say?
- It was.
And are you prepared to swear to that statement, Miss Marin?
I am.
She's lying. I know it.
- Mr. Oliver, isn't it?
- Yes, sir.
- Do you know this young man?
- No.
He's an actor... temporarily without a vehicle.
I'm afraid I don't remember.
Mr. Grady, my agent, took me in to see Mr. Denver when he was casting the Duncan play about two years ago.
That was just for a few moments, of course.
Oh, yes. I remember now. You're the boy that Mr. Kaufman recommended.
- Yes, sir. That's right.
- Yes.
- Have you seen Mr. Denver since?
- Yes, sir.
- When?
- The other afternoon.
Uh, Thursday afternoon when he came into the Star Theater.
- And you're sure it was him?
- Oh, sure.
Most actors know Mr. Denver by sight anyway.
And what time was that?
Oh, he came in about 2:30, I should say, and he left about 4:30.
What makes you so certain about those hours?
Well, I was planning to speak to him when he came out, about a part.
So I was keeping an eye on him, but sometime after 4:30, he got out without my seeing him.
You mean you hung around there all that time just to speak to him?
I wasn't just hanging around.
I work there, taking tickets.
Temporarily, of course.
And you're still willing to swear to that statement, Miss Marin?
Okay then.
You're under arrest, Mr. Mullen.
But he didn't do it!
Don't you think you interfered in this thing enough already?
He couldn't have!
How do you know he couldn't have,
Miss Marin?
Because I know him.
I know what kind of person he is.
No, no, Miss Marin.
That's not what you meant at all.
You meant something else entirely.
May I suggest what it was?
Everybody else has taken a shot at what happened.
Perhaps I can offer a version too.
What do you think of this, Miss Marin?
Will you come down here now?
I can't now.
I'm expecting Lottie back about 3:30.
- Just for a few minutes.
- No. I'll call you tomorrow.
Please, darling.
All right then, but just for a few minutes.
- Just tap on the door.
- All right.
What do you want here?
You filthy, dirty little beast.
You get out of here.
You're the one who's going to get out of here and out of New York too if you know what's good for you.
I don't know what you're talking about.
You don't have to. All you've got to do is get out and stay out.
That ought to be clear enough.
There.
And if ever you try to see him again,
I promise you now you'll be sorry for it as long as you live.
You just wait until I tell him about this.
Did you hear what I said?
Maybe you're the one who's going to be sorry for this.
You try to see him again and you'll soon find out who's going to be sorry.
You dreadful old woman. Do you really think this will do you any good?
- Are you going to get out or not?
- He loathes you. He despises you.
- And if you don't believe it, ask him.
- I've told you...
You don't dare to, because you know what he'd say.
He's sick of you and your meanness, and he's sick of being a slave.
He hates you! He hates you!
How about that, Miss Marin?
- It's not true!
- No?
It's a complete lie, you've made the whole thing up and you can't prove one word of it!
I got this in your kitchen this morning,
Miss Marin.
Is it yours?
It's some scribbles and a grocery order.
Mr. Mullen said it was yours.
Now, uh, the police lab tells me that this drawing, which we took to be by the girl,
Was actually drawn by the same hand and same ballpoint pen that did those doodles... which you did.
That's all we had to go on until you...
Lottie!
You don't hate me, do you?
Please tell me.
Please!
Nancy Ordway's trouble was that she was a purpose girl who forgot her purpose.
She fell in love.
Unfortunately, the fellow she fell in love with was Miss Carlotta Marin's husband.
Personally, I'd just as soon try to take something away from Rocky Marciano.
What do you think they'll do to Lottie?
That I couldn't tell.
A thing like that's up to the jury.
I can hardly wait.
Why, Peter.
No, I mean, for one of the greatest dramatic actresses in this country to open in court.
I can already see her in the witness chair... without any makeup, her hair just a little straggled and gray... wearing a rather faded print dress from a bargain basement... and no girdle.
And when this poor, brave, pathetic little housewife gets through with that jury...
They'll probably convict me.
That is not impossible.
    - You know who that was?
    - No.
             Major Lincoln Bond.
I wonder what he's doin' back here.
                       I wonder.
   Edwards to General Banner,
   I can see it again.
     It looks like the fire
     is back to the wing.
'Roger, Edwards.
I can see it now in my mirror.'
  'I'm reducing power
  to idle position. Stand by.'
     General, this Mickey McKee.
 I don't see any fire now.
 Is your warning light still on?
   'Affirmative, Mickey,
   no fire in the mirror now'
    'but the warning light's
    still on.'
'I'm stop-cocking the throttle, and comin' in.'
 Okay, we'll be all set for you.
     I want crash trucks
     at both ends of the runway.
  Calling Crash Control,
  we have an F-102 in trouble.
  Give us equipment
  at both ends of the runway.
  You got fire again, general.
  Don't try to land, bail out.
      'Relax, Mickey,
      we'll never locate'
     'the cause of the fire
     that way.'
  'If I can't make the runway,
  I'll land on the dry lake.'
Don't try it, she may get worse.
Get out while you can.
   'Negative, I'm coming in.'
I'm sorry, Lt. Sweeney, but only the rescue party is allowed in the crash area.
It's still dangerous, ma'am.
        - You too, sir.
        - Okay, captain.
            Mm-hmm. Yeah, I see.
   Oh, what's his condition now?
   Hmm, good.
What about the plane, any report come through on it yet?
               What do you know,
               it's Major Bond.
   - Welcome back to Edwards.
   - Thanks, Jerry.
Just visiting.
    - What'll you have, sir?
    - Scotch on the rocks.
                      Coming up.
                      How is he?
 Hospital says he's okay.
 He'll be back at work tomorrow.
          I was afraid this time
          he'd had it.
     Excuse me.
     Major Bond, meet Major Lee.
Bromo Lee?
I've heard about you.
     I've heard about you.
  I saw the general coming in.
With that much fire, you'd have thought he'd have bailed out.
   Looks like you don't know
   General Banner.
  He's allergic to abandoning
  any aircraft..
    ...if it's still flying.
    Well, it's getting late.
          - Goodnight.
          - 'Night.
Bromo's been making quite a name for himself with those speed and altitude records.
               Oh, I don't know.
      Always figure we got
      other pilots just as good.
         But he rates number one
         with General Banner.
      'There's no question
      about that.'
           Tell me..
...the general still doing a lot of tests, like the one tonight?
  Are you kiddin'?
  He flies more than his pilots.
      Especially the tough ones.
That's what I hear.
     Mickey.
   You should know better, Linc,
   this is no way to do things.
Well, maybe I should've come in through the back door.
             The idea is to give
             a little notice.
 Why, we have a band that jumps
 at any excuse to start playing.
They'd need a better excuse than me.
                 Sit down, Linc.
Well, since you having made general obviously, you've been doing something else with your time.
               Well, I just had
               another daughter.
All by yourself?
        No, there was some woman
        around at the time
           by the name of Sarah,
           I think.
I think so too.
How is she?
    They're all wonderful, Linc.
   Well, you didn't come
   all this way just to find out
         that we're loaded
         with kids at our house.
 Mainly, I came all this way
 to get away from where I was.
           Washington? I thought
           that's the place
       where everything happens.
  Not any of the things
  that I know anything about.
 You know why I'm here, Mickey.
   I want a job test flying.
         Yeah, I know.
  And I know all the questions
  you've got to ask
     before you can give me
     any sort of an answer.
   First, "Am I alright now?"
            Are you?
           I'm fine.
     All I need is a job
     that I know I can do.
  I know what a spot
  it's putting you in to ask.
         That doesn't bother me.
          The only thing
          that really matters is
             are you sure
             you're alright now?
      'Maybe you need
      a little more time.'
           I'm okay.
                    I don't have
                    to tell you
           if it were up to me
           you'd already be set.
  It goes without saying that
  I'll put in a request for you.
    Then it's up to the general.
Banner?
Is he everything they say he is?
     He's a real good man, Linc.
What's his attitude going to be about me?
                 Let's find out.
                 Come on.
    Hi, Connie. Any chance of
    seeing the man for a minute?
 Probably. You're ranked pretty
 high around here, you know.
'Yes?'
     Col. McKee would like
     to see you, general.
        - 'Send him in.'
        - Yes, sir.
See how easy it is when you're ranked pretty high?
       'Thanks, Connie.'
Oh, by the way..
I think this is what
Sarah means when she says
I'm always putting my foot in my mouth.
Anyway, there's a guy outside
I think you used to know.
  I used to know lots of guys.
That's what I mean.
So, you probably know this one.
         Linc.
                  Hello, Connie.
This is a fine thing to do to a girl.
             Well, I didn't know
             you were here.
 - Last time I heard you were--
 - I was in dating.
That was quite a while ago, Linc.
                Yes, yes it was.
General Banner requested me here about a year ago.
                             Oh.
You would've known all this if
I hadn't started feeling silly about all those letters
I was writing and never getting any answers.
           Yeah, well, it wasn't
           that exactly, I--
Lots of time can pass before you even know it.
                           Yeah.
            Well, all in all,
            wouldn't you say I..
  ...look a lot younger
  than you've ever seen me look?
I was thinking that but...
I couldn't find just the words.
Good Ol' Linc... he can always tell when a girl's about to go completely to pieces.
I haven't even asked you what you're doing here.
                Well, I'm trying
                to get a job
     which no one seems to think
     I have a chance of getting.
You'll never know until you ask.
           Well, it used to be..
           knew before I asked.
              Well, things have
              a way of changing.
Don't they just?
          Connie, how about
          having dinner tonight?
I'd like to, but..
I'm afraid I'm going to have to work tonight, Linc.
     Well, couldn't you tell him
   that a ghost out of your past
   showed up unexpectedly?
The general is a man who doesn't believe in ghosts.
But if you're going to be around for a few days..
         Not if the news is bad.
Well, I better be getting back to my desk.
Oh.
         Connie, isn't there
         something you could do?
        I mean about the dinner.
I'm afraid not, Linc.
If I'd had any warning..
...but of course you didn't know I was here.
Goodbye, Linc.
  But, general, I wouldn't be
  asking you to assign Bond if..
 Look, he wasn't a collaborator.
         Oh, wasn't he?
 A confession he made to
 the Chinese about germ warfare
      sounded a lot like
      collaboration to me.
     Alright, so he signed
     a piece of paper.
 But not until he'd held out
 for 14 months of brainwashing
       and gone through..
     Hell, who knows
     what they go through.
              But more important
              than anything..
     ...before he went to Korea,
     he was turning into
        the most promising pilot
        I'd ever run across.
          He had natural ability
          and judgment.
  And what you need more
  than anything else right now..
                   ..experience.
What I need more than anything else right now is pilots I know I can count on under stress.
I'm sorry, Mickey, that doesn't sound like Bond to me.
           But who knows how bad
           the stress got?
           Maybe nobody could've
           taken it any longer.
Maybe.
   He tried to kill himself by
   slashing his wrist, you know.
     We turn down good men
     every week.
  How can you ask me to lower
  that standard for Bond?
 Bond met those standards when
 he came here originally, sir.
     There's no use
     trying to convince me.
     It doesn't matter
     how I feel personally.
 What matters is, that I have
 pilots I know I can count on.
  With Bond, I wouldn't know.
   That's all there is to it.
Believe me, it's a rotten decision to make.
 It looks as though
 I was giving him a final kick.
It  wi be the final kick, sir.
      If it is, I'm sorry.
 That doesn't change anything.
                Well, it looks
                as if we've won.
           Maybe full production
           on the XF-120.
  Great. It's about time too.
        I gotta go fly.
Well, you're in the right branch of the service for it, general.
Never without a word on the subject, these civilians.
      You were right.
      I used to know him.
I was sure I had the right girl.
    Oh, general...I'd like
    you to meet Major Bond, sir.
    - General Banner.
    - Glad to meet you, sir.
Haven't I seen you before?
      I don't believe we've met.
Thanks for trying to pry me out of there last night.
             Well, sir, I wasn't
             doing much good.
                 The rescue boys
                 got you out.
About your request, Bond
I'm afraid I'll have to turn you down, I'm sorry.
Too bad you had to come all the way out here.
           It meant a lot to me.
Look, if you'd be interested in anything else around here except test flying..
- That's nice of you. sir.
- You let McKee know if you are.
Where are you staying?
        I piled in last night
        on Joe and Polly Craven.
   From all the fuss you'd think
   they were glad to see me.
   - Great actors, those two.
   - Yeah.
In our theater group they don't come any better than Joe and Polly.
    - When are you leaving?
    - Tomorrow morning.
      In case you don't know it,
      I'm having dinner tonight
                with the Cravens
                and the McKees.
      Thanks, Mickey,
      I know how hard you tried.
See you later.
  Well, you know what
  it was like during the war.
       No place to eat,
       no place to park.
   Luckily, of course, we had
   only two children then.
Only two..
Sounds like a whole gang to me.
      Believe me, Linc,
      two children aren't enough
           to completely destroy
           a large house.
         Stick around a few days
         and you'll see.
    Absolutely, Linc, and you're
    not gonna leave tomorrow.
    You just can't do things
    like that.
    Just pop in after
    who knows how many years
    then turn right around
    and pop right off again.
  Before anyone's had a chance
  to get used to you again.
Now, why would you want me and my long sad face around?
It may be long and sad, but it's a familiar face.
    Andf I think old friends
    are the best friends.
            She didn't read that
            any place.
       She made it up
       on the spur of the moment
         just for this argument.
You better watch yourself, pal.
This is the kind you wind up marrying.
          Don't worry,
          I'll keep my guard up.
       Don't you agree?
       If he did marry me
               it'd be nice
               for the children.
'Don't worry, you'll find out.'
       Not at this rate,
       I won't.
    Connie told me
    she was working tonight.
  So what? It's already 10:30,
  they worked until ten
    and then Connie dragged
    the general down here
  for a little Saturday night
  relaxation.
   You know, I think I'll ask
   that girl for a dance.
                      Uh, Linc..
Nothing, I was just gonna wish you luck.
            Thanks.
   - Why didn't you tell him?
   - Why didn't you?
  There's nothing for anybody
  to tell anybody.
    He's just gonna ask her
    for a dance, isn't he?
      - Evening, general.
      - Good evening.
      How are you, Connie?
I was afraid you'd take off before
I had a chance to see you again.
    You've heard of
    the perennial bad penny.
 And I hope, sir, you've
 heard of the universal custom
    of asking an attractive
    young lady to dance.
                  Oh, I've heard
                  of it alright.
     I can't say that I
     particularly approve of it.
             But if it's alright
             with her, major.
It's alright with me.
        Thank you, sir.
        You know, a lonely major
        can find himself
     flying with his wings
     cut off
  by making a pass
  at the general's girfriend.
          It isn't that exactly.
But it is something.
      Well, we've been going out
      quite a bit together
      and you know how
      those things are built up.
      How serious is it, Connie?
       If somebody asked me that
       yesterday, I..
...would have said pretty serious.
       - What's changed?
       - Stop it, Linc.
              You know very well
              what's changed.
            You don't sound
            very happy about it.
                   Why should I?
             What's there to be
             happy about finding
         you still get disturbed
         about someone
      who hasn't even given you
      a thought for over a year?
  - You know better than that.
  - How?
  That big stack of letters from
  you that I treasure so much?
        Like old times,
        isn't it?
    I don't think it's much
    like old times, do you?
Oh, I'm sorry, sir.
I certainly didn't mean to disturb you but there's been trouble at the rocket testing station and I--
         Alright, Sweeney,
         pull yourself together.
        - I'm leaving right now.
        - Oh, yes, sir.
   - So, you're at it again.
   - Oh, it isn't my fault.
    Being a general's aid's
    a lousy position to be.
  I-I-I didn't mean that, sir.
     It was an unfortunate
     choice of words--
   - Alright, Sweeney.
   - I'll go with you, Bill.
 No, it's early, you stay here
 and have a little fun.
    You can bum a ride with
    the McKee's or someone
       I'll see that she
       gets home, sir.
       Yes, the major
       can see you home.
       Thank you, major.
      - Alright, Sweeney.
      - Yes, sir.
       Why don't we leave
       by the front door?
Thank you, sir.
       - Goodnight.
       - Goodnight, sir.
But at least somebody's on my side.
               Just pray that
               it isn't Sweeney.
Why won't you tell me about Korea?
    Honestly, Connie, I'd rather
    tell you about it
         than anybody else but..
      ...it'd be like two people
      trying to communicate
   with each other,
   each in a different language.
            I just don't think
            you'd understand me.
Alright, then let's forget it.
From now on, if anybody asks you anything you tell them to check with me.
     I don't want a whole lot of
     people checking with you.
              If it's scars
              you're looking for
                I've got some
                worse than that.
I just wanna be sure they're all healed.
Gone as far along toward healing as they can without some help.
What kind of help, Linc?
    I need somebody to show
    some confidence in me again.
      Believe me, I never needed
      anything so desperately
               in my whole life.
            What it amounts to..
                ...I guess, is..
  ...starting from scratch and
  selling myself all over again.
   Ever try to sell something
   that nobody wanted to buy?
         - Connie, I--
         - Don't, Linc.
           - Why not?
           - Why not?
 Linc, you can't just wander
 back here after all these time
    and pick up right where
    you left off.
You're not the only one that things have happened to since you've been gone.
And believe me, you're not the only one who's been hurt.
You hurt me bad, Linc, real bad.
Taking me in your arms isn't going to help me forget it.
                        Connie..
You talk about needing someone to show some confidence in you..
Why couldn't you have shown a little in me?
Didn't you know that no matter how cut up you were mentally or physically, you could've come right back to me and that's all
I would've cared about.
   Perhaps I needed some time
   to pull myself back together.
I didn't want you all together.
I wanted you all the pieces.
So I could show you how much I loved you by helping you get back.
'I'll try to make it brief, sir.'
  'I'd like to quote something
  you said in a speech once.'
You said that the most important requirement of a test pilot
      is the desire to be
      a test pilot.
No doubt about it.
       Well, that I've got, sir.
           And I think my record
           will back me up.
         Then you went on to say
         that the second-most
           important requirement
           is stability.
That's right.
And since you brought up your record, I..
Go ahead, major.
   Well, sir, unfortunately,
   at this point
    the only way I can prove
    my stability
      is for somebody
      to let me prove it.
      Also, unfortunately
   nobody who's in a position
   to let you prove it
   could possibly ignore
   everything on your record.
    No, sir, they couldn't.
  The only reason that I'm
  taking up more of your time
    is to try to impress you
    with my complete desire
      to be a test pilot.
  In regards to my stability,
  I..
    ...I think I'm qualified
    there again, sir.
    I'm sorry but the answer
    is still no.
Alright, sir, may I take you up on your offer of last Saturday?
         Some other job
         on the base?
   You didn't seem
   very interested Saturday.
       What made you
       change your mind?
    Well, when it came time
    to leave, I..
   I realized that even if
   I couldn't do test-flying
  I'd still like to be around
  where it's being done.
     I'm afraid I've gotta
     say no to that too
       because it,
       it wouldn't work.
        And I quote you
        right back..
  You mentioned your complete
  desire to be a test pilot.
    We both know that there
    isn't any substitute.
 But maybe there's another way,
 a better way.
 Nobody knows all the answers,
 least of all, me.
But I do know some testing procedure.
Suppose you have to determine the stability of an experimental aeroplane, how would you proceed?
    I'd work up to it, sir,
    step by step.
   Exactly.
   You nibble at the problem.
  Now, on that basis
  I'm going to change my mind.
     I'll go along with you
     for that first step.
  I'm willing to re-assign you
  as a test pilot.
But you'll be limited to chase and pace.
None of the major projects.
   - I understand, sir.
   - Alright, it's up to you.
      Yes, sir.
      Thank you, general.
           - Bill..
           - General.
     Senator, may I present
     General Bill Banner
     he runs the show here.
  I've been hearing about you
  for years, Banner.
  Thank you, sir, I hope
  you had a comfortable trip.
     Very smooth. General Shelby
     is a good pilot.
      Don't tell me you finally
      broke down and got an aid.
    Yes, sir.
    Gentlemen, Lt. Sweeney.
Lieutenant.
    Isn't that Lincoln Bond?
'Yes, Bromo's checking him out on the XF-120.'
- How long has he been here now?
- Little over two months.
I was surprised when you took him here.
       - How's he doing?
       - Alright so far.
That about covers it.
And remember she's got a high rate of sink.
Your first landing, come in flat with plenty of power.
 - Hard to judge the flare out.
 - Roger Wilco.
And try to bring it back in one large attractive piece, huh?
         I'll bend every effort.
       - All checked out?
       - Yeah.
              I get to do it
              all by myself now.
This makes just about everything on the base you checked out on now, doesn't it?
                     Just about.
How you coming along with Bromo?
       I'd say, I was
       winning him over, slowly.
At least, he stopped foaming at the mouth every time my name's mentioned.
    That's progress.
    You can't get away from him.
           'Right..'
I'll see you later.
'That was flight 745 taxing.'
         Quite a view.
Sixty four square miles of level rock-hard landing surface.
 We figure you save the country,
 a quarter of a billion dollars
     in safe emergency landings.
   Edwards is one of ten centers
   under General Shelby
         and Aero Search
         and Development Command
         but it's developed into
         a pretty big operation.
         I have over 8000 people
         on duty here.
  There's our rocket engine test
  station right over there
                 in those hills.
     High altitude speed course,
     deceleration track.
             All this is just
             a bird's eye view..
     Oh, there's the Gilbert 120
     taking off right now.
'Yes, Mr. Gilbert was telling me we really got something there.'
Before I came here, I thought you tested mainly airplanes at Edwards.
Just what is your mission?
  Quality. Flying hardware of
  better quality than the enemy.
   Not just the aircraft but
   the power plant, the armament
 the RADAR, everything that goes
 with the vehicle
           to make up a complete
           weapon system.
   How long have you been in
   command here, Bill?
          Well, it's going
          on six years now, sir.
         I'm just really getting
         broken in, Senator.
 What it boils down to, is this.
   Our whole future air strategy
rests on the accuracy of the data, our guys pass on to the planners at Washington.
I'd call that a good sized responsibility.
   We try and pick the good ones
   and throw out the bad.
What was that?
 Sonic boom. An aircraft
 penetrating the sound barrier.
You're looking at an engine right now with enough thrust to reach outer space.
     - What's stopping you?
     - Money.
   Then the guiding system.
   We're still perfecting it.
'Attention! Final warning for ten second countdown.'
  This high speed track is the
  world's fastest
    and straightest railway.
 - 'Ten. Nine.'
 - Sled'll do 1500 miles/hour.
   'That way we can make
   some tests on the ground'
  'without risking the pilot.'
'Five-four-three-two-one.'
'Fire!'
   Senator, there you see
   an Air Force tanker refueling
       a bomber and two fighters
       at the same time.
'Yes.
A B-66, an F-100, an F-101.'
 'Some of our latest aircraft.'
        - Bye, Senator.
        - Thanks a lot.
    - Goodbye, general.
    - It's a pleasure, sir.
           Carry on.
 We just intercepted a radio
 call, Mickey, what's going on?
 Major Bond just called in, sir.
 Having trouble with the 120.
             Says he's got
             aileron on reverse.
'Edwards Control to Major Bond.
What's your present position?'
I'm eight miles south to the lake at 22000 ft., Edwards.
    I'm trying another roll
    to the same side.
'There she goes again,
Edwards Control.'
I think I've got something else.
 I've got wrinkles in the skin.
 My left wing.
This is General Banner, how bad are the wrinkles, Bond?
     - Not too bad, sir.
     - Can you land safely?
   - 'Affirmative, General.'
   - Alright, bring her in.
 - Keep checking on that wing.
 - Roger.
'Control to Major Bond, you're cleared'
   'for an immediate landing
   on runway 22.'
 - What'd you do? Pull ten Gs?
 - No, sir. Less than five.
     - Report to my office.
     - Yes, sir.
 Did you authorize Bond to carry
 out any stability tests?
    No, sir. It was strictly
    a check up.
      - I recommend, sir--
      - Yes, Connie?
   - Major Bond is here, sir.
   - Send him in.
        Come in, Major.
    What's the story, Linc?
    It's the wings, General.
They won't take the design load on a rolling pull out.
       Until, they're
       beefed up stronger
     you've got
     a dangerous airplane.
      Somebody's gonna
      pull the wings off.
    I don't agree, General.
I pulled more than five Gs with no sign of structural weakness.
You must've exceeded design limits.
  It happened exactly at 4.5 Gs.
You must've pulled more Gs than that. Maybe you blacked out?
  No, sir, I didn't black out.
  I'm sure it's gust loads.
Hitting few bumps for a fraction of a second would do it.
    If it could happen to me
    it's gonna happen to others.
  Bromo Lee is plenty capable
  of running phase four tests
 on that aircraft. You were up
 there for familiarization.
 Why did you start
 your own private test program?
 Sir, I stumbled on a condition
 that didn't feel right.
    I wasn't looking for it.
But when it happened
I thought I oughta pin it down.
            Alright.
But Gilbert's chief engineer tells me, you must be mistaken.
      Maybe he can explain
      the wrinkles, sir.
    The question is
    what really caused them?
  You're telling us, Major Bond,
  we're committing ourselves
 to mass production of a fighter
 with a dangerous defect?
                 Yes, sir. I am.
    Mickey, is the other 120
    in commission?
 It'll be ready tomorrow, sir.
 Set it up for me. Linc, I want
 you to fly chase.
And help me duplicate the exact conditions you encountered.
  General, since Bromo's been
  directly responsible
  for this project, it'll save
  time if he flew with Bond
       on the first one.
Save my time? What do you think
I'm here for, Mickey?
        Very well, sir.
 That's all for now, gentlemen.
Bill, you suppose bond pressed the panic button up there?
             I'm gonna find out.
How do you feel about his reliability?
               It's this simple.
If I were commanding an army and he was guarding my left flank
   I'd be running there every 30
   minutes to check up.
Why you wasting your time on him?
  Well, because what I said just
  now is a personal feeling.
      I'm gonna judge him on
      performance, nothing else.
You know, Bill, this X2 may well be as far as we can go with a human pilot.
And expect him to survive.
                    Yes, I know.
How soon are you starting tests with rocket power?
 Not for several months.
 We've lot of blind drops to do.
Decided on our pilot for it.
        I'll take that one, sir.
      That's been my pet project
      from the beginning.
  I've watched six years, nine
  million dollars and the brains
   of 280 engineers go
   into that X2. Excuse me, sir.
  - Banner.
  - 'This is Harvey Gilbert.'
               Yes, Mr. Gilbert.
'What's this about wrinkles in the wing? Is it true?'
              Yes, that's right.
              News travels fast.
'...accepting his report?'
        We don't know yet.
        We'll find out tomorrow.
Of all people, we don't consider a brainwashi qualified
        to say we've got
        a bad airplane.
   I'd like to come up there
   right away.
   Fine, we'd be glad to see ya.
  Alright, Mr. Gilbert, goodbye.
     Well, he's in a real storm.
Well, I can't say I blame him.
I'm equally concerned.
Bill, running Air Research and
Development Command has turned into a tremendous responsibility.
I could sure use you at my headquarters.
   How soon do you think you can
   wind it up here?
Wind it up sir?
Oh, I can't leave this job now right in the middle of all the new projects we're getting into.
Not that I don't appreciate your asking me.
I know there's no job more important than yours.
    I'm glad you agree we're not
    exactly an old man's home
        back there in Baltimore.
    Leave some of the strenuous
    testing to Mickey and Bromo.
                     The others.
Oh, it's good for the circulation, General.
     Just remember, you and I
     aren't getting any younger.
Yes, Connie.
                 I have the 104
                 data here, sir.
Oh, good let's have a look.
That's all.
         - Hey, Connie?
         - Yes, sir.
Do you think I'm getting old?
            Well, I'd say that's
            the usual procedure.
I mean maybe I'm too old to compete with these youngsters around here.
       - You mean flying?
       - All departments.
        In experience, I'd say
        you're older than Moses.
          But you seem ten years
          younger than you are.
It's a good definition of what the commander here better be.
You know, Connie, one thing
I'm not going to do is get my brains knocked out at any high school competition over you. I'd lose that one.
All I'm asking is that I be the first one you tell.
              Of course, I will.
            The first thousandth
            of a second, I know.
    Oh, wait. Mr. Gilbert,
    this is Major Bond, sir.
         - Mr. Gilbert.
         - Oh, yes.
            Lincoln Bond.
            Structural Engineer.
         Just a pilot,
         Mr. Gilbert.
             Very modest of you.
  I was just talking with
  Gilbert's chief test pilot.
    He inspected the damage
    and frankly he thinks
    you're out of your mind.
    However, I'm going ahead
    with the test anyway.
           Yes, sir.
Give me a double. Honest double.
Do you mean that, sir?
   Yeah, I wanna see how four
   ounces of alcohol
  affects a flyer's judgment.
    Connie, I didn't know you
    were working the West Coast.
Linc, you've a real important day ahead of you tomorrow.
   They're all important, honey.
  It's just that some are little
  more depressing than others.
       However,if it bothers you
       to see me to lush it.
              I'll wait it out
              until you've gone.
What's the matter? You're afraid you're wrong?
I have a feeling I've never been right a day in my life.
It should show one way or other shouldn't it?
          It should but then you
          never know.
I know one thing, mister.
Anybody who's thinking about having any kind of tussle at all with Bill Banner had better think it over carefully because he's really in the heavy weight division, Lincoln he belongs there.
   Yours could hardly be an
   impersonal opinion, could it?
I just know the General in question never ran away from a thing in his life.
He faces things head on, Linc.
And when he does, people always wonder what hit them.
There was a time when I thought that you and the General were two of a kind.
 Let's just chalk it off to
 girlish enthusiasm, shall we?
         Just a minute.
    Hi. Am I still under
    the 10 o' clock curfew?
              Yes.
 - Well?
 - Since you made it. Come in.
 I juts want it made perfectly
 clear that even if you hadn't
    waded into me with those
    bitter, stinging remarks
   I still probably wouldn't
   have taken that drink.
  Because I believe basically
  people don't change.
 I'm a man who's never run away
 from anything in his life.
 I don't know whether you know
 it or not, Connie
  but I've always been a man
  who's faced things head on.
 Whenever I have, people always
 wondered what hit them.
  If you've ever had any other
  impression of me
       you've been wrong.
       Unfairly wrong.
I should be boiled in very warm oil.
    - At least.
    - How about some coffee?
  No, sir, because I've got
  a very important day tomorrow.
 And I believe a man should get
 to bed early before such a day.
Well, hurray for you,
Horatio Alger.
      Thanks for the help, lady.
Any red blooded girl interested in experimental aircraft would've done the same.
   Ha ha. Hey, that's very good.
      About the red blooded girl
      interested
       in experimental aircraft.
       Very good indeed.
 You know all the people around
here who think I'm going crazy like Gilbert's chief pilot, he's an awfully good man, Connie.
     Maybe I did read those
     instruments wrong.
  At Red Prison they got me to
  where two and two
       looked like five.
       Maybe I am crazy.
I'm betting my own money that you're right in this thing.
    Sure, what do all those
    old highly trained engineers
                  know about it?
Will you please relax, Linc?
        It'd be too smooth today
        at 20000.
Well, if we don't find the right conditions there, General
Bromo reported some turbulence lower down.
  All set, Bond. Now, give me
  the exact conditions.
      Okay, General, start
      a shallow dive.
      Stay 40 knots below
      critical Mach number
       at 95 percent rpm.
  Pull 4.5 Gs and a steep bank
  to the left.
'Then give it, three quarter air rock.'
             Roger.
    What is this,
    you're giving us, Bond?
  Everything's normal.
  I pulled more than 5 Gs too.
'I'm afraid the air is too svelte at this altitude.'
   'No gust blows that time.'
'I'll try lower over the mountains at the Pass.'
       'Ought to be bumpy
       enough there.'
'Roger.'
'Giving it 4.5 Gs now, Bond.'
  I can't find anything wrong.
I guess we're not getting quite the same conditions, General.
You mean wrinkles in the wings, you're right. Returning to base.
             Roger.
Well, Mr. Gilbert, everything's seemed normal to me.
     That's not conclusive.
The fact remains that one of my pilots did get wrinkles and till we find out why, Mickey
I want the phase four test
 done over from the beginning.
 Assign Joe Craven to work with
 Bromo on the 120 full time.
   - Double check everything.
   - Yes, sir.
  I'm all for caution, General
  but it can't be overdone.
      Specially in view
      of...circumstances.
    I repeat I think
    you're airplane is okay.
  But if there's one chance
  in a million that Major Bond
   stumbled on something.
   Now's the time to find it.
    I'm confident you won't
    find anything.
  Unless the design limits
  are exceeded. Right, Major?
         Who knows, Mr. Gilbert
         what a limit really is?
It's funny.
Trippin over my own feet.
Me and my big feet.
        You don't look too well,
        General.
Oh, I'm alright.
  The flu's going around. You
  oughta see the flight surgeon.
Flight surgeon?
No, I feel fine.
You've been General Banner's friend longer than anyone else.
I suppose it's occurred to you he can't stay here forever?
       Oh, I hadn't given it any
       thought, sir.
     You know how he flies
     all the winds himself.
   Finds it hard to delegate
   responsibility?
Mickey, it's time to think about another commander.
            But his whole life
            is test flying, sir.
Naturally it'll be an important promotion.
               Boot him upstairs
   when every pilot on this base
   would crawl on his belly
              to Chicago for it?
Mickey, what he's got in his head is too valuable.
General, he wouldn't understand.
  Do you want to risk losing him
  to some big company
     like Gilbert Aircraft?
I know he's had some fancy offers.
That's where you come in. I'm talking to the next commander.
   Start getting ready. Take all
   the load off General Banner.
Aren't you placing me in an awkward position, sir?
  Let's say an unusual position.
       One that involves loyalty
       to General Banner.
I don't know what to say, sir.
             You know him better
             than anybody.
Nudge his elbow every chance you get about the challenge.
The bigger challenge waiting for him in Baltimore.
       I'll try, General.
     But you're handing me
     an awful big pair of shoes.
  Okay, sergeant, pop it out.
With this amount of drag, you'll drop from 20000 feet
                    like a rock.
       We figure 4000 feet
       to be the lowest altitude
         you can get rid of this
         deceleration chute
 with a safe margin to pull out.
Suppose the electrical release mal-functions
    have you got
    a manual release for me?
        Yeah we've installed one
        just in case.
Good. You know the old saying,
"If it can go wrong, it will."
  You wouldn't change your mind,
  would you, General?
 You know, I've been kinda
 hurting to do this test myself.
You've got enough to do.
I can't spare you right now.
I was thinking, sir, Linc Bond's got this current as anyone
 on this F-94. They want you
 pretty badly at the conference.
            I think he'd be okay
            to do this test.
You know my policy, Mickey, Bond is limited to chase and pace.
           Well, I knew that was
           your policy, sir.
       But he's been putting out
       harder than..
          I think he's really
          earned the right, sir.
I know he's putting out.
Just leave it that way.
 You see what I mean about Bond?
'He's been bumming rides in the
B-66 in his spare time.'
     'I don't when
     the guy ever sleeps.'
You're pressing, Mickey. So is
Linc. Pressing too hard, maybe.
Trying to prove something.
That alone can make him a risk.
Oh, thanks.
Oh, never mind, Connie.
No more coffee.
I think I'll knock off.
Why don't you take off, Connie?
You're probably late for a date.
                 That's alright.
That reminds me. When's that wing-ding Lillian's giving?
   - Thursday night.
   - I guess we'd better go.
  Help celebrate Joe Craven's
  promotion.
      When you said we, were you
      including me?
Of course. Why?
Somebody else ask you?
  Incredible though it may seem,
  somebody did.
                   Lincoln Bond.
Make a note in your book to remind me to ask you sooner.
That won't be necessary. You did ask me over a week ago.
     I told Linc,
     I was going with you.
      Hmm, that's a mark
      of a good commander.
     Instinctively he does
     the right thing.
      - I did.
      - You certainly did.
   But don't you go assuming
   I would've said no to Linc
      if he'd asked first.
 Oh, before you go. The mayor's
 appointment tomorrow.
    Will you be down
    from your test by nine?
   Better change him to 9:30.
  And operations called about
  your chase pilot.
 Bromo has to go to El Centro.
     Mickey's tied up too.
 They said Bond was available.
    - Alright, make it Bond.
    - I'll tell them.
   - Thursday night, then.
   - 'Affirmative, General.'
   Okay, Bond, I'm deploying
   the chute.
             Roger.
    You fouled up, General.
    You're only half open.
 Getting plenty of drag though.
 - I've got 4300 feet, General.
 - Roger.
     It's about that time.
     There she goes.
 - You've strung up the shoot.
 - 'I know it.'
   Both release
   has mal-functioned, Linc.
 Well, maybe I can land anyway.
 The chute's only half open.
    Negative. Might open
    all the way any second.
'If it does, you'll spin like a top.'
     I'm gonna have to try
     to snag the chute.
 Don't try it, Linc. Pull away.
        That was close.
      Can you hold
      that position, Linc.
   I'll have to hold it
   right through the landing.
I don't want the chute to pull lose and open again.
   Okay. I'm landing straight
   ahead on the lake.
             Roger.
 For Pete's sake don't lose me.
  We'll leave everything as is
  until they photograph it.
                       Yes, sir.
Well, Linc, how much do I owe you?
            A couple of bucks
            ought to care of it.
Two dollars, huh?
A minute ago my neck wasn't worth two cents.
Well, no sweat, huh?
                       No sweat.
           Lucky we didn't
           need the rescue boys.
Yeah. They would've been a little late.
Too far out.
You know, Linc,
I can't figure you out.
In these emergencies..
Well, it just doesn't jibe with that business in Korea.
Of course, you never did tell me your version of it.
I wish you would though.
Maybe if I understood what really happened.
Something beside the inhuman treatment.
What they use?
Drugs, truth serum?
                        No, sir.
Well, it just doesn't figure.
Even with torture, you're not the kind to crack.
What made you do it, Linc?
  Have you ever been in solitary
  confinement, general?
               Tortured mentally
               24 hours a day.
     Physical torture is nothing
     compared to the things
          they've learned
          to do to a man's mind.
That covers it, huh?
            Well, it's something
            entirely new, sir.
                 If a man hasn't
                 been through it
              it's no use trying
              to explain it.
Look, I'm trying to give you a break.
Give me something to go on.
   What does it take, general?
You think I'm hard to convince, huh?
Well, I am.
I always have been when the test date issued a flaw.
Can't you give me a better reason?
            I wish I could, sir.
Well, at least you showed me something today.
Another step, shall we say?
And if I step you into something more important what's your first choice?
                  Rocket flight.
          X-2 project.
Ah, that's a big step.
Too big maybe.
I always had
Mickey and Bromo in mind
  to work with me on the X-2.
However, Bromo's still got his hands full with the Gilbert job.
- I'll talk it over with Mickey.
- Yes, sir.
      ♪ Off we go into the
      wild blue yonder ♪
             Crash!
        Come on, Carmen.
            Come on.
   You don't want me to have
   to right in my log book
     that you're
     uncooperative, do you?
 I'm not going to your quarters
 for a nightcap
       or anything else.
       I just wanted you
       to see how much
      my wonder box
      geraniums had grown.
        Sure...you did.
        Come on, Carmen.
            Come on.
         - Hiya, Jimmy.
         - Hello, Linc.
 How about all this
 fancy dan flying you're doing?
          Trying to make
          Chuck Yeager look bad?
Chuck could fly better than that before he ever saw a plane.
   So much modesty to be in just
   one little old Korean hero.
A couple of real sharp chase pilots you got tonight.
                 Chase is right.
           I don't like him very much.
Mickey.
        The only man now alive
        who's flown an aeroplane
                 with no wings..
           ...faster than sound.
I was in a hurry.
It's just no way to live.
You're always so jumpy and jittery and popping right out of your skin every time you hear his voice.
           Just because I always
           try to be cognizant
                     to my duty.
Don't know what that means, but I do know all he has to do is say hello, and you shoot up 14 feet.
  Debbie, I wish you'd try not
  to exaggerate every time.
        Hello, Sweeney.
          Oh, oh, oh!
Honestly, you did it again.
You embarrass me so much!
    'Why do you always
    do that sort of thing?'
         His heart's going
         to give out long before
      he makes first lieutenant.
Ha ha!
                    Oh, so soon.
Well, Joe and Polly have finally gotten here.
Let's go.
    - Hi, Joe.
    - Good evening, general.
Those look awfully good, colonel. Congratulations.
      - Thank you, Connie.
      - You too, Polly.
    - Congratulations, Joe.
    - Thank you.
   What does his promotion
   really mean to you, Polly?
Well, for the first time in our marriage, food on the table.
        When did we get a table?
      I'll be right back.
Alright.
    Any messages for anybody
    in the powder room?
No. But on your way past the bar
     would you mind telling
     my husband
     that his leave from me
     has just expired?
    I always like to be
    the bearer of bad news.
            Then as we pulled
            into a steep climb--
   You will be sorry to hear
   that you were just shot down.
  Sarah's reeling in her apron
  strings again, is she?
             Oh-oh!
   I was saving that
   to go to camp this summer.
             But..
Here you sit all by yourself and there are literally 50 girls
        who are drooling
        for you to ask them out.
You know that, but nobody ever tells me.
       Nobody tells you.
 I suppose that little red head
 at the PX isn't telling you.
    Every time she sees you
 she goes into
 that exaggerated model's walk.
     She throws her hips
     out so far you wonder
  if they're ever coming back.
Well, I assume, naturally that she has some sort of trouble with her back.
        Aren't you going
        to join us at the table.
Oh, I was afraid a man all by himself would put a crimp in the fun you couples are having.
            You're just a lonely
           wanderer, aren't you?
I don't think so.
          Well, I hope I see you
          at the table.
             Have a drink on me.
No, thanks, Bromo.
I was just leaving.
           Yeah, maybe your wise
           at that, buddy-buddy.
       'Cause I hear you've been
       bucking real hard
   for the job tests on the X-2.
          And I kind of consider
          that belongs to me.
Good luck.
       I don't like you, mister.
     I'll go home and stick
     my head in the oven.
    Oh, I got a better idea.
Let's go outside, and I'll knock it off for you.
        Come on, Bromo.
        I've got--
              No.
Hey, don't hit him again.
He's drunk.
Linc!
                He held my arms.
              He shouldn't
              have held my arms.
How could you hit him?
      You didn't see
      what happened, Bill.
 It was on account of that man
 over there trying to stop him.
      Whatever it was
      you better get home.
           Yes, sir.
Come on, men, give him a hand.
Connie.
Let's get back to the table.
        We can't just..
         Alright, Bill.
         You go ahead.
     I'll only be a minute.
             Linc.
                If only that guy
                 hadn't held me.
I know, Linc.
I know.
        Look, Connie,
        you're with the general.
             You better go back.
It's perfectly alright.
    Please, it's bad enough now.
I want to talk to you.
        Go on back in, will you?
Better go in there, and explain how it happened.
          That's the worse thing
          I could do.
I know he'd understand.
         Better for him to think
        that I go around socking
        helpless people
                   than peg me
                   for a psycho.
You've got to do something.
                 Leave it alone.
- I'm going back to the base.
- I think I better go with you.
           Don't you understand?
      The general gave me
      my chance and I muffed it.
If he gave me another, I still wouldn't have the right to..
Finally it happened.
Blew my top.
That's what they've all been waiting for.
   Nobody's been waiting for it.
    They're pulling for you.
    Everybody.
It's going to be alright.
         You still don't get it.
              I'll spell it out.
   The Reds hammered me
   to my limit and broke it.
    I put a patch over it,
    and hoped it would hold.
  For months now, I've been
  praying that it would hold.
       Trying to hide it.
    Now the patch is pulled off.
                      It's over.
No, Linc, it isn't.
                  It's all over.
                Goodbye, Connie.
       - Hi there, Linc.
       - Hi, Hank.
    - The party over.
    - No, it's still going.
What are you doing here so late?
  We got a glide drop coming up.
         Hope you get in on her.
         Been making any hit way
         with the old man?
Afraid not.
Just thought I'd drop by and see how it was going.
  You, uh, changed the stick?
             Yeah.
  Moved it half an inch forward.
        Go ahead and try it out.
                     Any better?
I'd even give it a little more.
Of course, it's not up to me.
I wish it were.
       Well, you're about the
       same size as the general.
    Like sitting in the nose
    of a guided missile.
       I guess that's what
       it would be like, alright
        when she carries a man
        right up to outer space.
           Only I'll never know.
      You'd like to Hank,
      wouldn't you?
                   Be the first?
Who wouldn't, Linc.
             Yeah.
'And to have this kind of behavior'
   'from two of our officers'
 'well, it...it's just not the
 sort of thing we point to'
 'with pride in the Air Force.'
      I just can't drink.
      I know that, sir.
 But you proved you could stay
away from it, Bromo for three years until last night.
Now since this is your first slip with me
I'm gonna leave it this way.
Some people just can't drink.
If you ever take another, your career in the Air Force is over
I'll see to that.
      I think the general
      can count on me.
              Yes.
       'Sir, can we give
       out a statement'
    'on the chute emergency
    yesterday?'
 No! I don't want the
 drag chute story released yet.
         - 'Yes, sir.'
         - Not yet.
      'How do you want me
      to handle it, sir?'
 - We've had several inquiries.
 - Alright. Then hold them off!
              Yes.
    Sir, major here is Bond.
I mean Major Bond is here, sir.
          Send him in.
I was about to send for you.
Have you talked to any newspaper men?
                        No, sir.
Somebody leaked a premature report on our chute emergency.
I dropped by your quarters last night.
Where were you?
  I returned to the base,
  and then to my quarters later.
You weren't there when I looked for you.
   Excuse me, general, it'll
   save a lot of questions--
Just let me handle the questions.
 The big question is what am I
 supposed to do about that show
 that you put on with Bromo Lee
 in a public place?
If I ground you you'll be dead weight.
       If I take strong--
 May I say something, general?
    I came in here to resign
    from the Air Force.
So you're, you're ready to quit, hmm?
      I never should've started.
You had to start somewhere.
I appreciate your giving me a chance against your instincts.
Let's say in spite of my prejudice.
             Your first judgment
             was right, sir.
Have a seat, Linc.
What I wanted to talk to you about last night..
                     No, thanks.
...I got to thinking that over.
It just didn't add up.
You slugging Bromo Lee.
Unless there was something else.
     That's right, sir.
     It was a mental thing.
     That's why I want out.
  I was about ready to put you
  into the X-2 project.
So you want to admit failure, huh, Linc?
Look, I've gone along with you this far
I'd feel like it was my failure too.
   I'm sorry, sir. I'm just
   afraid I'd mess things up.
Ever read William Faulkner?
         Yes. Most of his stuff.
Well, than maybe you'll remember something he said when he accepted the Nobel Prize.
   It's sort of, sort of goes
  to the heart of the job here
  at the flight test center.
   Something like,
   "Man will not only endure
       he will prevail."
         Some men, yes.
You'll never know where you'll find it, Linc.
 Excuse me, sir.
 It's Col. McKee. An emergency.
Craven's having trouble, sir.
Aileron reverse, she just snap rolled on him.
'Chase pilot to Craven.'
   'Chop your throttle, Joe.'
 'Just turn everything loose.'
  Okay, Joe, you're out of it.
           Level off.
Craven from Gen. Banner.
You okay, Joe?
'No sweat now, general.'
   'but I was real busy there
   for a minute.'
   'I sure got the reversal.'
   General, I've got wrinkles
   in both wings.
        'How bad, Joe?'
      Worse than Bond got.
        Chase to Craven.
        Hold your level.
       I'll have a closer
       look underneath.
 Wrinkles underneath too, Joe.
    I'm afraid you're
    gonna have to leave her.
'Chase pilot from Gen. Banner.'
       'You're sure it's
       that bad, Harry?'
     Affirmative, general.
The wrinkles are flexing bad in the left wing. May come off.
     General, I still think
     maybe I can land.
       Negative, Joe.
       Get out, get out.
        - Bail out now.
        - Okay, general.
 But I'd like Harry to get some
 pictures of those wrinkles
      before I fire myself
      out of here.
 'Use your own judgment, but I
 advise you to bail out now.'
   Hardly take a minute, sir.
          Okay, Harry.
     'I'm ready to eject.'
         'Stay clear.'
'Bail out, Joe.
Joe!'
       'Can you hear me?'
       'Bail out!'
    'Joe, fire the canopy.'
        'Joe, bail out.'
     Joe, fire the canopy.
     'Get out of there.
     Fire the canopy, Joe.'
'Too late, general.'
  'His chute opened too late.'
Just the instant before he hit.
            Are you sure, Harry?
      'Positive, general.
      He was too low.'
    'Never had a chance.
    He...he's had it, sir.'
           Well, I guess there's
           nothing we can do.
        I let him wait too long.
It's not that, sir.
He, he never answered any calls.
He must've been knocked out.
          Mickey, you know Polly
          better than I do.
     - It might help--
     - I can tell her, sir.
 Only Linc really knows Joe and
 Polly better than any of us.
      - Maybe..
      - Do you mind, Linc?
   - No, sir. I'll tell her.
   - Thanks.
  I'll send the flight surgeon
  and the chaplain over later.
   - 'I'll drop in shortly.'
   - Yes, sir.
   Why do they always have
   to have two or three kids?
          Hiya, Linc.
          Come on in.
        Hi, Uncle Linc.
     Daddy hasn't come home yet.
Hi, Uncle Linc.
            Polly..
  Maybe we'd better go inside.
              Joe?
          I heard it.
He was..
Well, it was instantaneous.
Let me get Sarah McKee for you.
                        Not yet.
         Please, just excuse me,
         will you, Linc?
     You know, I've been
     ready for a long time.
  Kids, how about going to
  Aunt Sarah's for ice cream?
Yeah, yeah!
      Okay, let's go.
      Thanks, Uncle Linc.
        How'd she take it, Linc?
General, she's got more guts than anybody you ever saw.
               Think she's ready
               to see me yet?
Yes, sir. I think she'd really appreciate it.
           I want to thank you
           for going over there.
   We've got a big job ahead
   of us with this X-F 120.
   Major modifications
   on that wing and all that.
   It'll be your project
   of course if you want it.
- Sir, I appreciate that very--
- Ah, Linc.
I hope this has knocked out all ideas of your resigning.
      Well, general, it hasn't
      changed the primary reason
                that I felt
                I should resign.
   The fact that Joe went in
   still doesn't change the fact
            that I went
            sky high last night.
Why shouldn't you have gone sky high?
If a man's taken a lot of nasty beatings while somebody's holding his arms he'd have to be an insensitive idiot not to react violently when he felt somebody was holding his arms again.
What would you do if you got out?
You'd make a rotten insurance salesman anyway.
            I wouldn't care
            to argue that point.
     Well, sir, if I'm back
     on the payroll
     what you said about working
     into the X-2 rocket program
           sounded awfully good.
Alright, Linc, you've got it.
                 Thank you, sir.
          Okay, Linc.
          8000 feet.
      Count off for drop.
       Five, four, three
          'two, one.'
            'Drop.'
Hank, I'm still getting a little buffeting in the nose.
   Stability could be better.
'Stalling action, good.'
         Linc to Harry.
      Are you sure my nose
      wheel is straight?
                     How was it?
You ought to know.
       - Wow!
       - Same way I felt.
That was really something, Mickey.
But the real charge would be with rocket power.
      The old man's set on doing
      that himself.
          I think it's
          a younger pilot's job.
 - I know.
 - I got this much out of him.
      I get to do this next drop
      with partial rocket power.
I want you to get qualified to be my launch panel operator.
Well, that's something anyway.
      Passing 20,000 feet.
    Launch panel cameras on.
     Selector switch, off.
      Count for jettison.
       Five, four, three
          'two, one.'
        Locks, jettison,
        switches open.
       Come off the X-2!
       Come off the X-2!
        Get out, Mickey.
        Get out quick.
   Bond to pilot.
   Drop her! Drop her quick!
'Yes. Yes, sir, that's right.'
'Well, what happened?'
'We don't know, general.'
 'They told me she just blew.'
      Something more Barn,
      but we haven't--
'Well, anyway, this settles it.'
     I'm not taking anymore
     chances with you.
     On the test
     with full rocket power
      you've got to assign
      somebody else.
      The day I can't run
      my own show
     I'm turning in my suit
     for a different model.
'Don't be pig headed, and stubborn.'
'I'm sorry, but if you tie my hands--'
'Nothing personal, Bill.'
       'I'm just thinking
       of the Air Force.'
'Yes, general,
I appreciate that.
'But we need you here in Baltimore.'
'Okay. But not until this one's finished. This one's mine.'
'Remember what I told you.'
'We're not getting any younger.'
'Yes, sir. Goodbye.'
  That was a real close call
  for Mickey McKee, wasn't it?
                    Yes, it was.
Mickey said you must've been almost psychic.
As if you'd had premonition.
            I don't go for that.
         The instruments weren't
         reading quite right.
   Anyway, testing is based
   on facts not premonitions.
   Linc, there's still one thing
   after all this time I don't
   understand about test flying.
             What?
Why anyone should want to do it?
Well, why do you think?
   I haven't the slightest idea.
At first, I thought maybe it had to do with something silly like
 proving to each other
 what real good he-men you were.
      But I never met one of you
      that needed to prove that.
     Maybe it's the money.
No, I'm serious.
It's a mystery to all the other women I know.
  Well, part of it is the
  excitement and satisfaction.
             Doing something
             for the first time.
                  The challenge.
       That's a very small part.
            When you love flying
     you know that the aeroplane
     wants to fly right.
You get a compulsion to make it as perfect as you can.
 But with you and Bill and the
 others, it's almost fanatical
        like a religion.
               Ever heard of
               a good ballplayer
       who lived much
       of anything but baseball?
Or a woman that didn't know that the...only really important thing in life was having children?
  But that happens to be true
 because if we didn't have them
 where'd you get
   all your ballplayers or..
          Test pilots?
         That's right.
 Is Bill Banner still planning
      to fly the big test
      in the new X-2?
              Yes.
        Should he do it?
    Have you or Mickey explained
    to him that he shouldn't?
 No, Gracie Allen, we haven't.
    Just the same, if Bill
    shouldn't fly that test
      and everybody knows
      that he shouldn't
 then somebody should tell him.
       Yes, they should.
       Linc, I'm almost..
   I probably shouldn't ask.
  But what's Bill going to be
  up against in the X2?
  Well, you can't say exactly.
   First time a man goes over
   a hundred thousand feet..
     ...three or four times
     the speed of sound
 hits the heat barrier
 where the friction of the air
   makes the wings white-hot.
And the pilot has a fraction of a second to make decisions.
    Why did they have to use
    anything as dangerous
       as rockets anyway?
    There isn't any choice.
         No other type of engine
         develops enough power.
           Those two rockets
           in the tail of the X2
          give it enough power
          to drive a battleship.
Linc, do you have any idea?
Well, any premonition about Bill?
      I don't have premonitions.
             Connie, you've said
             Bill four times?
      If it weren't Bill
      it would be another pilot.
You know it's Bill.
             Yes, I guess it is.
            Well, I got an early
            take off tomorrow.
     - 'Do you have to go?'
     - Yes, ma'am.
Goodnight, Linc.
At least I'm glad it doesn't have to be you.
   You haven't understood a word
   I've been saying, have you?
    I'd give anything if it were
    going to be me up there.
           And I'd give anything
           if it were me
          instead of Bill Banner
          down here.
         I don't know.
   She oughta be ready for
   a try at full rocket power
    but how can you be sure?
    This time she's going
    right out of this world.
Let's face it, Hank, you'll never be sure.
      Maybe one more time
      with one rocket.
     I don't see why, Hank.
   Mickey and I have already
   done three more drops
   than we did on the old X2.
       Everything is
       checking out okay.
      Maybe you're right.
      Well, whatever
      General Banner says.
Yeah. See ya, Hank.
Any chance he'll let one of you fly?
           Not a prayer,
           you know the general.
     Thanks for the coffee.
  Tomorrow's okay with Hank
  if it's okay with you, sir.
         Then it's on.
       Something else
       isn't okay though.
      Ever since you went
      to Baltimore, Mickey
  there's been new heat
  on me to delegate this test
      to a younger pilot.
   Now I get a TWX that's
   a next thing to an order.
     Did you have anything
     to do with this?
  They pinned me down, general
  I gave them a straight answer.
       Younger pilot,
       you for instance?
                             Me.
                        Or Linc.
        We've been friends
        for a long time, Mickey.
           If I can't depend on
           your absolute loyalty
I'd better get me a new director for flight test.
       If it's a question
       of loyalty, sir
  that'll never be necessary.
                           Okay.
        Alright, wheel and deal.
               Set me up for
               an 05:30 takeoff.
           Yes, sir.
May I speak to the general privately?
      What's on your mind, Linc?
Well, sir, I never wanted to ask a favor.
 Pretty hard to turn you down.
   Well, what I mean sir is..
    ...I'd like to make this
    next flight in the X2.
- You too?
- I hope I'd earned the chance.
     I've flown in her
     as much as anyone now.
      I don't know what's
      the matter with you.
   We know this
   is gonna be a rugged one.
       That makes it
       my responsibility.
    I have a responsibility
    too, sir.
       That day in
       the locker room..
    - What about it?
    - You almost passed out.
- That could happen in the air.
- I told you, I tripped.
      We both know
      what happened, sir.
   I think the flight surgeon
   would agree with me.
You'd go to the flight surgeon?
    I didn't say that, sir.
    I know best whether
    or not I'm safe to fly.
      General, may I speak
      off the record?
        Go right ahead.
I know what it's like to go through hell.
I've been there, and I failed.
And I would've failed here too if it hadn't been for you.
You gave me your confidence and your respect.
                  You earned it.
      Not my own respect.
 'You reached your limit once
 but that was all in the past.'
     You would've held out
     until they killed you.
         Keep talking.
I think I've faced myself on that score.
Have you faced yourself?
Have you faced the fact that with your stubborn pride your blind egotism and time catching up with you
     'you could jeopardize
     this whole project?'
        That's enough--
If you keep this up your failure can be greater than mine was.
   You're the only man alive
   that could say that
   to me that I'd listen to.
       Is it true, Linc,
       is it that bad?
    I wish I didn't have
    to be the one to say it.
      Do the rest of them
      think the same?
    I can't speak for them.
      Well, I'm not making
      any promises.
   But I can't fly them all.
       Somebody else will
       get their chance.
       But not this time.
       I still wish you'd
       change your mind.
   I guess that's all, Linc.
      Very well, general.
And I think you can count on the zero wind for the landing.
               Hello, Linc.
               Hank, come on in.
         - Coffee?
         - No, thanks.
             What's the problem?
      Well, sir, it isn't
      exactly a problem.
      Hank was
      wondering whether..
    Well, maybe you better
    tell the general, Hank.
General, I've been going over the figures again and could we have one more drop at half power?
Just one rocket?
I know you're anxious to go ahead--
  I'm not that anxious, Hank.
       Not until
       you're satisfied.
Then I'd suggest, sir that Major Bond repeat exactly the same test he made last week.
   Well, the only thing
   I don't like is the delay.
'I'd really feel better, sir.'
   What's your opinion, Linc?
   Well, sir, everything checked
   out normally on my last test
      but it would give you just
      that much more information
      before using both rockets.
        Certainly couldn't hurt.
          Okay, Hank,
          I'll approve one more.
You take it up, Linc.
You'll be getting a piece of what you want anyhow.
'I appreciate it.'
       After Bond's test
       set me up
      as soon as possible
      for the final test.
  - Both rockets, full power.
  - 'Yes, sir.'
            'Linc.'
     How about flying Chase
     for you tomorrow?
                   Okay, Mickey?
             Okay.
'Weather report's still okay for take off time?'
       'Affirmative.
       Wind's subsiding.'
    - 'Forward tank filled?'
    - 'Check.'
     - 'Aft tank filling?'
     - 'Check.'
'Operations inform Bond we still have a zero wind for takeoff.'
    'Affirmative, he knows.'
   That liquid oxygen
   is really frosting up now.
      Snow's beginning
      to form on the skin.
How do you feel, Linc?
  I always get a few butterflies
  with rocket power.
         Yeah, so do I.
  But using one rocket you can
  stay below 70,000, alright.
                No problem, sir.
       - Good luck.
       - Thank you, sir.
       - Good luck, Linc.
       - Thanks, Bromo.

'He's fired both rockets.'
- He's got full power, general.
- I know, I heard it.
What does he think he's doing?
       Did you give him
       a choice, general?
       Later, Hank.

   Are you still reading the X2?
'Negative.'
     'His transmission
     was getting garbled.'
  'The last I heard, he was

                      Thank God.
The flight surgeon is here, sir.
And Colonel McKee.
Send them in, Connie.
            Come in.
How is he now, doc?
  He's gonna make it, general.
Good.
      Near as we can tell
  a wind blast tore open
  that experimental face plate
      at high altitude
      and passed him out.
      And he's got a mild
      brain concussion
      and an injured hip.
Ah, Linc's a pretty rugged customer.
       He had to be.
       It was that close.
 He's still coming out
 of a severe case of the bends.
      Call for excellent
      physical condition.
Oh, I know that.
 Frankly, sir, a pilot your age
 wouldn't have had a chance.
 Well, sir, I better be
 getting back to the hospital.
Thank you, doctor.
Well, Mickey, I've been here a long stretch.
Seems like a lifetime.
      Tests that came out
      okay, and some bad.
'But in a way they were all successful.'
What I meant to say Mickey..
...I've got news for you.
I'm transferring to headquarters
Air Research and
Development Command.
I'll recommend you to succeed me.
     We're gonna miss you, Bill.
I know you'll do a great job.
           - Thanks.
           - Coffee?
No. thanks, Connie.
   About Linc's flight, sir.
 General Shelby's headquarters
 wants to know
  if he violated orders
  going to full rocket power?
Of course, he didn't violate orders.
I left it up to him.
Verbal orders.
   Then we better amend this
   operations order, officially.
         - In writing.
         - Alright.
It's amended.
        - Line of duty.
        - Yes, sir.
  Connie, what are your plans?
   I imagine I'll stay here.
Of course, I'd love to have you go with me.
          I'd love it too, Bill.
         But you know that story
         about the paratrooper
         who was afraid to jump.
    And the general asked him
    why he became a paratrooper?
                    The boy said
    "Because I like to be around
    guys who like to jump."
   I guess I'm that way
   about the flight test center.
Yeah.
I know what you mean.
   I'll miss these guys
   around here, all of them.
        Mickey, Linc.
        Specially, Linc.
 There's a big fire burning
 out of control near the dump.
                Tell them to put
                it out, Sweeney.
           Yes, sir.
   But, sir, won't they just
   naturally go ahead and..
    Yes, sir, I'll tell them
    to put it out.
   Connie, I'll tell you how
   much I think of Lincoln Bond.
                He deserves you.
      Now, you'd better get over
      to the hospital, hmm?
Bill, I'm so sorry.
      Look, you don't have
      to worry about me.
Anybody who's waited as long as I have to get married probably knows subconsciously what a rotten husband he'd be anyway.
             Don't give me that!
              I'm tellin' you
              what the man said.
       I'm not responsible
       for the caliber of orders
     that are given around here.
           Under this antiquated
           military system
             they're given to me
             and I pass 'em on.
      Lieutenant Sweeney.
  I'm leaving for Baltimore
  so you'd better get me packed.
           Yes, sir.
  If you're coming along you'd
  better start packing yourself.
  You mean, you want me to go
  along with you, sir?
    Well, let's put it this way.
  After having been
  in the service almost 25 years
         I've run into something
         completely new
               and unheard of
               in the Air Force.
 I don't want to let it get away
 until I find out what it is.
           Yes, sir.
      Something new
      and unheard of, sir?
        A second lieutenant with
        a general for an aid.
That'll finally hit him tonight in bed and he'll go right through the ceiling.
I don't care if that is against regulations.
     It's all your, Mickey.
  Take good care of the place.
I won't say goodbye, Bill.
I know you'll be droppin' in on us to keep your hand in.
     Connie, you take good
     care of Mickey.
        I'll do my best.
       And I'm not saying
       goodbye, either.
     You'll be coming back.
          Sure, sure.
   You see that Linc follows
   Doc Bailey's orders.
  He's not supposed to be out
  of bed for another week.
           What the..
      - Button your coat.
      - I know, I know.
   It was like getting out
   of Alcatraz but I made it.
                          Linc..
      ...when are you gonna
      learn to carry out orders?
  Sorry, general, but I've never
  been able to miss a parade.
           Present..
          Order, hut.
        There goes a lot of guy.
A lot.
   As much as we'll ever see.
Well, almost.

(Mrs. Wiggs) Guten Tag,
Mister Marlowe.
<font color="green">Warum haben Sie keines</font>
<font color="green">meiner Bilder verkauft, Wiggie?</font>
Es kommen nur wenige Leute vorbei,
Apfelwein interessiert die Leute nicht.
<font color="green">Das ist schade.</font>
<font color="green">Der Apfelwein ist schuld.</font>
Es tut mir leid.
Zeigen Sie mir Ihr neues Bild?
Zeigen Sie mir Ihr neustes Werk.
<font color="green">Sie verstehen nichts von Kunst.</font>
<font color="green">Ich habe Hunger.</font> <font color="white">- Mein Mann schlug</font> sich auch auf den Bauch.

* Kuh muht. *
<font color="green">Kann man in New York mehr verkaufen?</font>
Kommen dort mehr Leute vorbei?
<font color="green">Dort wohnen Millionen von Menschen.</font>
Dann müsste es da besser gehen.
<font color="green">Aber was sind das für Menschen?</font>
<font color="green">Sie verstehen alle</font>
<font color="green">nichts von Kunst.</font>
<font color="green">Sie sind immer in Eile.</font>
<font color="green">Haben Sie Zigaretten?</font>
* Motor startet. *
<font color="green">Die andere Hälfte kaufe ich morgen.</font>
<font color="green">Warum repariert Ihr Sohn alte Autos?</font>
Er verkauft sie. Er braucht Geld.
<font color="green">Verdient er als Sheriff nicht genug?</font>
Er wird nur bezahlt, wenn er jemanden verhaftet.
Das ist sehr schön.
<font color="green">Beim Malen war ich traurig.</font>
Was ist das? <font color="green">- Gute, alte Vicky,</font>
<font color="green">meine strengste Kritikerin.</font>
Ihre Bilder sind schön.
Mrs. Rogers sagt das auch.
<font color="green">Ist das die hübsche Frau</font>
<font color="green">mit dem kleinen Jungen?</font>
Ich erzählte ihr von Ihnen.
Wir sprachen über eigenartige Menschen.
Ich meine, mit einer eigenen Art.
<font color="green">Was sagte sie über mich?</font>
Nichts.
<font color="green">Hier ist mein Einkaufszettel.</font>
Ich geh schon mal rein.

<font color="green">Gefällt Ihnen mein Lied?</font>
Ja.
(Calvin) Sam!
<font color="green">Hallo, Calvin.</font>
Haben Sie die Schüsse gehört?
<font color="green">Nein.</font>
Ich schon.
Schießen ist hier verboten.
<font color="green">Warum?</font>
Ich habe es verboten.
<font color="green">Was haben Sie dagegen, wenn</font>
<font color="green">ab und zu einer auf die Jagd geht?</font>
Schüsse können tödlich sein.
<font color="green">Die Leute schießen nur in die Luft.</font>
Vllt. haben Sie recht, aber Verbot ist Verbot.
Ich will wissen, wer geschossen hat.
Strafe muss sein.
<font color="green">Brauchen Sie zufällig nur Geld?</font>
<font color="green">Sagen Sie Bescheid, wenn ich Ihnen</font>
<font color="green">Ihre Arbeit erschweren kann.</font>

Gestern sagten Sie das nicht.
Was wollen Sie von Calvin?
<font color="magenta">Die Bilder sind bezaubernd.</font>
<font color="magenta">Ich hörte, die sind von Ihnen.</font>
<font color="magenta">Warum verkaufen Sie die nicht?</font>
<font color="green">Das ist eine gute Idee.</font>
<font color="magenta">Sie singen immer so schön.</font>
<font color="green">Warum sagen Sie das?</font>
<font color="magenta">Ich wollte Ihnen eine Freude</font>
<font color="magenta">machen, Mister Marlowe.</font>
<font color="green">Woher kennen Sie meinen Namen?</font>
<font color="magenta">Er steht auf den Bildern.</font>
<font color="green">Er ist kaum zu entziffern.</font>
<font color="magenta">Richtig, er ist kaum zu entziffern.</font>
<font color="magenta">Finden Sie nicht auch?</font> <font color="white">- Schon</font> möglich. Niemand kauft die Bilder.
<font color="green">Danke für Ihre Aufmunterung,</font>
<font color="green">Miss Gravely.</font>
<font color="magenta">Woher kennen Sie meinen Namen?</font>
<font color="green">Von Wiggie.</font>
<font color="magenta">"Wiggie" gefällt mir.</font>
<font color="magenta">Darf ich Sie auch so nennen?</font>
Wenn Sie pünktlich bezahlen, in Ordnung.
Ich habe alles, Mister Marlowe.
Speck, Bohnen, Blumenkohl,
Zucker, Salz, Tee, Öl und Margarine.
Das macht 1,95 Dollar.
<font color="green">Und die halbe Schachtel Zigaretten.</font>
Dann sind es 2,05 Dollar.
<font color="green">So viel?</font>
<font color="green">Wo ist mein Geldbeutel?</font>
Zahlen Sie, wenn Sie ein paar Bilder verkauft haben.
* Hund bellt. *
Einen Augenblick, mal!

<font color="magenta">Ist es die richtige Fingergröße?</font>
<font color="green">Ja, es ist meine Fingergröße.</font>
<font color="magenta">Was kostet sie?</font>
15 Cent.

<font color="green">Ungefähr 50.</font>
<font color="green">Für wie alt würden Sie sich halten?</font>
<font color="magenta">Ich bin 42.</font>
<font color="magenta">Ich kann Ihnen meine</font>

<font color="green">Ich mache Ihnen eine flotte Frisur.</font>
<font color="green">Dann können Sie noch</font>
<font color="green">mal zehn Jahre abziehen.</font>
<font color="green">Gibt es hier Parfum, Rouge</font>
<font color="green">und Lippenstift?</font> <font color="white">- Ja, irgendwo.</font>

* Türklingel *

<font color="cyan">Wahrscheinlich kommt jetzt</font>

<font color="green">Ist das Ihre Leiche?</font>
<font color="cyan">Es war ein Unfall.</font>

<font color="cyan">als ich mich auf den Weg machte,</font>
<font color="cyan">war ein besoffenes Rotkälbchen.</font>
<font color="cyan">Es hat gegorene Beeren gefressen.</font>
<font color="cyan">Da wusste ich:</font>
<font color="cyan">Heute gibt es Probleme.</font>
<font color="cyan">Ich wusste nur nicht,</font>
<font color="cyan">dass es mich trifft.</font>
<font color="cyan">Mein Kühlschrank war leer und ich</font>
<font color="cyan">hatte Appetit auf Kaninchenbraten.</font>

<font color="cyan">Das weiß man nicht.</font>
<font color="green">Es war Schicksal oder Zufall,</font>
<font color="green">wie man's nimmt.</font>

<font color="green">Was können Sie dafür, wenn er Ihnen</font>
<font color="green">in dem Moment vor das Gewehr läuft.</font>
<font color="green">Man kann auch von einem fallenden</font>
<font color="green">Baum getötet werden.</font>
<font color="green">Wie man stirbt, ist Zufall.</font>
<font color="green">Machen Sie sich keine Gedanken.</font>
<font color="green">Sie sind unschuldig.</font>
<font color="green">Sie wollten ihn nicht töten.</font>
<font color="green">Die eiserne Faust</font>
<font color="green">des Schicksals schlug zu.</font>
<font color="green">Sie hatten nichts im Kühlschrank und</font>
<font color="green">mussten jagen.</font>
<font color="green">Sie wollten ein Kaninchen schießen,</font>
<font color="green">keinen Spaziergänger.</font>
<font color="green">Machen Sie sich keine Vorwürfe.</font>
<font color="cyan">Ich mache mir keine Vorwürfe.</font>
<font color="cyan">Ich werde damit fertig.</font>
<font color="cyan">Es war ein Unfall.</font>
<font color="cyan">Ich hab es nicht mit Absicht getan.</font>
<font color="green">Und um was geht's dann?</font>
<font color="cyan">Ich mache mir Sorgen um mich.</font>
<font color="cyan">Um mich und mein weiteres Leben.</font>
<font color="cyan">Ich muss meine Unschuld beweisen.</font>
<font color="cyan">Die Polizei glaubt mir sonst nicht.</font>
<font color="cyan">Begraben wir ihn</font>
<font color="cyan">und damit hat sich's!</font>
<font color="cyan">Die anderen sagen sicher nichts.</font>
<font color="cyan">Die Frau mit dem Jungen,</font>
<font color="cyan">Miss Gravely, Doktor Greenbow ...</font>
<font color="cyan">... und der Landstreicher.</font>
<font color="green">Das waren aber viele.</font>

<font color="green">Hoffentlich haben Sie recht.</font>
<font color="cyan">Keinen interessierte der Tote.</font>
<font color="cyan">Nur Sie.</font>
<font color="green">Das denken Sie vielleicht.</font>
<font color="green">Aber wenn man sich für ihn interes-</font>
<font color="green">siert, nachdem Sie ihn begruben.</font>
<font color="cyan">Ich will keine Probleme bekommen.</font>
<font color="green">Hatte die Frau mit dem Jungen</font>
<font color="green">kein Mitleid?</font>
<font color="cyan">Sie sah nicht traurig aus.</font>
<font color="green">Ja? Wie sah sie dann aus?</font>
<font color="cyan">Sie war hübsch.</font>
<font color="cyan">Wenn ich nur zwei Jahre jünger wäre.</font>
<font color="green">Und der kleine Junge?</font>
<font color="cyan">Der war an die vier, fünf Jahre alt.</font>
<font color="green">Das waren Mrs. Rogers und ihr Sohn.</font>
<font color="cyan">Jetzt begraben wir ihn,</font>
<font color="cyan">da sie mit dem Bild fertig sind.</font>
<font color="cyan">Den Rest besprechen wir später.</font>
<font color="green">Das gefällt mir nicht.</font>
<font color="green">Die Behörden wollen wissen,</font>
<font color="green">wenn jemand stirbt.</font>
<font color="cyan">Na schön, Sam.</font>
<font color="cyan">Vergessen Sie's. Ich muss mir</font>
<font color="cyan">was einfallen lassen.</font>
<font color="cyan">Ich habe ihn erschossen,</font>
<font color="cyan">also muss ich mich um ihn kümmern.</font>
<font color="green">Was wollen Sie tun?</font>
<font color="green">In Ihren Kühlschrank stopfen?</font>
<font color="cyan">Ihn hier begraben.</font>
<font color="green">Dann hält man Sie für den Mörder.</font>
<font color="green">Ich fang auch langsam an,</font>
<font color="green">misstrauisch zu werden.</font>
<font color="cyan">Wenn Sie als Künstler schon</font>
<font color="cyan">das Schlimmste annehmen,</font>
<font color="cyan">was soll dann erst</font>
<font color="cyan">die Polizei denken?</font>
<font color="green">Sie haben die Adresse.</font>

<font color="cyan">dass Calvin Wiggs jeden Tag</font>
<font color="cyan">die Post zum Bahnhof bringt.</font>
<font color="cyan">Das ist ein scharfer Hund.</font>
<font color="green">Sieht nicht gut aus für Sie.</font>
<font color="green">Wir machen Folgendes.</font>
<font color="green">Wir müssen Mrs. Rogers fragen,</font>
<font color="green">wie gut sie diesen Mann kannte.</font>
<font color="green">Vielleicht will sie zur</font>
<font color="green">Polizei gehen.</font> <font color="cyan">- Und dann?</font>
<font color="green">Vielleicht kannte sie ihn nicht gut</font>
<font color="green">und geht nicht zur Polizei.</font>
<font color="green">Dann begraben wir den Toten.</font>
<font color="cyan">Fein.</font>
<font color="cyan">Sie wollen wirklich anheuern?</font>
<font color="cyan">Wie spät ist es?</font>
<font color="green">Bald Mittag.</font>
<font color="cyan">Ich muss gehen. Ich bin mit</font>
<font color="cyan">Miss Gravely verabredet.</font>
<font color="green">Was sind Sie?</font>
<font color="green">Das ist doch nicht möglich!</font>
<font color="cyan">Doch.</font>
<font color="cyan">Die hätte 'ne schlechtere Wahl</font>
<font color="cyan">treffen können.</font>
<font color="green">Das entwickelt sich zu einer Affäre.</font>
<font color="cyan">Sie hat mich zu Blaubeer-Maultaschen</font>
<font color="cyan">und Kaffee eingeladen.</font>
<font color="cyan">Von Miss Gravely persönlich.</font>
<font color="cyan">Vielleicht gibt es auch Wein.</font>
<font color="green">Sie sind der erste Mann, der Miss</font>
<font color="green">Gravely besucht. Wissen Sie das?</font>
<font color="cyan">Es ist nie zu spät.</font>
<font color="cyan">Sie hat sich fabelhaft gehalten.</font>
<font color="green">Sie sind zu beneiden.</font>
<font color="cyan">Sie ist eine hervorragend</font>
<font color="cyan">konservierte Frau.</font>
<font color="cyan">Und Konserven muss man ja mal</font>
<font color="cyan">öffnen, richtig?</font>
<font color="cyan">Gehen Sie jetzt zu Mrs. Rogers.</font>
<font color="green">Wir müssen Harry verstecken.</font>
<font color="cyan">Das habe ich ganz vergessen.</font>
<font color="cyan">Na los!</font>

<font color="yellow">Guten Tag.</font>
<font color="green">Sie sind wunderschön.</font>
<font color="green">So etwas Bezauberndes habe ich</font>
<font color="green">noch nie gesehen.</font>
<font color="green">Ich muss Sie malen.</font>
<font color="yellow">Haben Sie noch andere Wünsche -</font>
<font color="yellow">Mr. Marlow, nicht wahr?</font>
<font color="green">Sie sind eine wunderschöne Frau.</font>
<font color="green">Ich male ein Aktbild von Ihnen.</font>
<font color="yellow">Jetzt gleich? Ich mache</font>
<font color="yellow">gerade Limonade für Arnie.</font>
<font color="green">Haben Sie jetzt keine Zeit?</font>
<font color="yellow">Für ein Aktbild nicht.</font>
<font color="green">Ich wollte Sie etwas fragen.</font>
<font color="green">Das habe ich jetzt vergessen.</font>
<font color="yellow">Dann war es wohl</font>
<font color="yellow">nicht besonders wichtig.</font> <font color="green">- Ja.</font>
<font color="yellow">Setzen Sie sich. Ich hole Limonade.</font>
<font color="yellow">Vielleicht erinnern Sie sich dann.</font>
<font color="green">Vielen Dank.</font>
* Glockenläuten *
<font color="yellow">Arnie!</font>
Hallo, Mister Marlowe.
<font color="green">Hast du ein Kaninchen gefangen?</font>
Ja. Haben Sie auch etwas gefangen?
<font color="green">Ja. Einen kleinen Frosch.</font>
<font color="green">Da ist er.</font>
* Lachen *
<font color="yellow">Er hat Hunger.</font>
<font color="yellow">Er braucht eine Mutter.</font>
Wollen wir tauschen?
<font color="green">Deine Mutter gegen meine?</font>
Nein, Kaninchen gegen Frosch.
<font color="green">Einverstanden.</font>
Das war ein gutes Geschäft. Tote
Kaninchen brauchen nichts zu essen.
<font color="yellow">Der Frosch bekommt jetzt Limonade.</font>
Vier Pfoten hatte der arme Kerl und konnte nicht wegrennen.
Er hätte ein Kleeblatt tragen sollen.
<font color="green">Und ein Hufeisen.</font>
Wie werden Kaninchen geboren?
<font color="green">Wie Elefanten.</font>
Natürlich. Warum besuchten
Sie mich noch nie?
<font color="green">Ich wusste nicht,</font>
<font color="green">wie hübsch deine Mutter ist.</font>
Wenn Sie die schon hübsch finden, sollten Sie meine Schleuder sehen.
<font color="green">Dann komme ich morgen wieder.</font>
Und wann ist das?
<font color="green">Na, der Tag nach heute.</font> <font color="white">- Das ist</font> doch gestern. Heute ist morgen.
<font color="green">Ist wahr, ja?</font>
Ganz einfach: Heute ist morgen.
<font color="green">Dann komm ich heute.</font> <font color="white">- Abgemacht,</font> dann sehen wir uns gestern.
<font color="yellow">Geben Sie sich keine Mühe,</font>
<font color="yellow">das zu verstehen.</font>
<font color="green">Danke.</font>
<font color="yellow">Limonade, Arnie?</font>
Ich hab schon zwei Gläser gemopst.
<font color="yellow">Du hättest nur fragen müssen.</font>
Gemopst schmeckt aber besser.
Können Sie mir das Kaninchen leihen?
<font color="green">Was willst du damit?</font>
Ich kann es gut gebrauchen.
<font color="green">Okay.</font>
Einen Frosch hat's mir schon eingebracht.
<font color="yellow">Wohin gehst du?</font>
Mal sehen, mit wem ich noch Geschäfte machen kann.
<font color="yellow">Komm aber bald nach Hause!</font>
Ja, mal sehen.
<font color="green">Wie ist Ihr Vorname?</font>
<font color="green">Wollen Sie ihn nicht verraten,</font>
<font color="green">dann erfinden Sie einen.</font>
<font color="yellow">Jennifer.</font>
<font color="yellow">Jennifer Rogers.</font>
<font color="green">Wie nett.</font>
<font color="green">Wer ist der Mann oben auf dem Hügel?</font>
<font color="yellow">Welcher Mann?</font>
<font color="green">Harry, der tote Mann.</font>
<font color="yellow">Ach, den meinen Sie.</font>
<font color="yellow">Das ist mein Ehemann.</font>
<font color="green">Was? Ihr Mann ist tot?</font>
<font color="yellow">Ja.</font>
<font color="yellow">Ist die Limonade süß genug?</font>
<font color="green">Ja.</font>
<font color="yellow">Ich trink sie gern sauer.</font>
<font color="green">Ist Harry der Vater von Arnie?</font>
<font color="yellow">Arnies Vater ist tot.</font>
<font color="green">Genau wie Harry?</font>
<font color="yellow">Ja. Es musste so kommen.</font>
<font color="yellow">Er war zu gut für diese Welt.</font>
<font color="green">Offensichtlich beschritt</font>
<font color="green">er gern gefährliche Wege.</font>
<font color="yellow">Er war unglaublich gut.</font>
<font color="green">Ihr Mund ist sehr schön.</font>
<font color="green">Besonders, wenn Sie "gut" sagen.</font>
<font color="yellow">Wollen Sie noch Limonade?</font>
<font color="green">Später vielleicht.</font>
<font color="green">Woher hat Arnie das Kaninchen?</font>
<font color="yellow">Er sagte, Käpt'n Wiles</font>
<font color="yellow">hat es geschossen.</font>
<font color="green">Ich würd gern</font>
<font color="green">noch mehr über Sie erfahren.</font>
<font color="green">Wie können wir das Problem</font>
<font color="green">mit Harry lösen?</font>
<font color="green">Haben Sie eine Idee?</font>
<font color="yellow">Vergessen Sie ihn - wie ich.</font>
<font color="yellow">Er verdient es nicht. Er war nicht</font>
<font color="yellow">grad 'ne leuchtende Perle.</font>
<font color="yellow">Wir sahen uns nur selten.</font>
<font color="green">Warum haben Sie ihn dann geheiratet?</font>
<font color="yellow">Ich versuchte schon öfter,</font>
<font color="yellow">mich über Harry auszusprechen.</font>
* Glockenläuten *
<font color="yellow">Niemand hat es verstanden,</font>
<font color="yellow">auch Harry nicht.</font>
<font color="yellow">Aber Sie ...</font>
<font color="yellow">... Sie sind ein Künstler.</font>
<font color="yellow">Sie verstehen mich bestimmt.</font>
<font color="green">Ich bemühe mich.</font>
<font color="green">Erzählen Sie mir alles.</font>
<font color="yellow">Vor einigen Jahren</font>
<font color="yellow">verliebte ich mich.</font>
<font color="yellow">Bis über beide Ohren.</font>
<font color="green">Und wer war der Glückliche?</font>
<font color="yellow">Robert.</font>
<font color="yellow">Wir wollten heiraten,</font>
<font color="yellow">obwohl mein Vater dagegen war.</font>
<font color="green">Haben Sie's getan?</font>
<font color="yellow">Oh ja.</font>
<font color="yellow">Dann ist Robert gestorben.</font>
<font color="yellow">Ich war verzweifelt,</font>
<font color="yellow">sechs Wochen lang.</font>
<font color="yellow">Dann merkte ich,</font>
<font color="yellow">dass ich schwanger war.</font>
<font color="green">Das war sicher ein Schock.</font>
<font color="yellow">Dann kam Harry.</font>
<font color="yellow">Sie hätten ihn erleben müssen.</font>
<font color="yellow">Der schöne Harry.</font>
<font color="yellow">Der gute Harry.</font>
<font color="yellow">Wie war sein Nachname?</font>
<font color="green">Harry Warp.</font>
<font color="yellow">Er war Roberts älterer Bruder.</font>
<font color="green">Verliebte er sich in Sie?</font>
<font color="yellow">Wenn's nur das gewesen wäre.</font>
<font color="yellow">Schlimmer! Er wollte mich heiraten.</font>
<font color="yellow">Aus Pflichtgefühl.</font>
<font color="green">Glaubten Sie, aus Liebe?</font>
<font color="yellow">Ja. Und Ich wollte ihn</font>
<font color="yellow">wegen Arnie heiraten.</font>
<font color="yellow">Ich erfuhr bald die Wahrheit während</font>
<font color="yellow">der zweiten Hochzeitsnacht.</font>
<font color="green">Was war während der ersten?</font>
<font color="yellow">Es war eine furchtbare Wahrheit.</font>
<font color="yellow">Die Wahrheit über Harry.</font>
<font color="green">Was ist passiert?</font>
<font color="yellow">Wie alt sind Sie?</font>
<font color="green">Ungefähr 30.</font>
* Hund bellt. *
<font color="yellow">Ich erzähle es Ihnen.</font>
<font color="yellow">Ich saß alleine im Hotelzimmer.</font>
<font color="yellow">Mein Nachthemd war sehr gewagt.</font>
<font color="yellow">Können Sie sich das vorstellen?</font>
<font color="green">Natürlich.</font>
<font color="yellow">Ich liebte Harry nicht.</font>
<font color="yellow">Aber ich wartete trotzdem auf ihn.</font>
<font color="yellow">Ich dachte, er liebt mich.</font>
<font color="green">Das war sicher schwer für Sie.</font>
<font color="yellow">Es war eine Vollmondnacht.</font>
<font color="yellow">Ich saß am offenen Fenster.</font>
<font color="yellow">Mir war kalt.</font>
<font color="green">Ja, natürlich.</font>
<font color="yellow">Warum erzähle ich Ihnen das alles?</font>
<font color="yellow">Einem Fremden - hoffentlich</font>
<font color="yellow">langweile ich Sie nicht.</font>
<font color="green">Nein.</font>
<font color="yellow">Möchten Sie noch Limonade?</font>
<font color="green">Später.</font>
<font color="yellow">Wo blieb ich stehen?</font>
<font color="green">Sie saßen am offenen Fenster, brach-</font>
<font color="green">ten sich in Stimmung und fröstelten.</font>
<font color="green">Wie ging es weiter?</font>
<font color="yellow">Das sagte ich alles?</font>
<font color="green">Ja. Wann kam Harry?</font>
<font color="yellow">Er kam überhaupt nicht.</font>
<font color="yellow">Er rief am nächsten Morgen an.</font>
<font color="green">Was? Am nächsten Morgen erst?</font>
<font color="yellow">Er hatte am Abend in der Zeitung</font>
<font color="yellow">sein Horoskop gelesen.</font>
<font color="green">Ein schlechtes?</font>
<font color="yellow">Das Horoskop sagte: "Fangen Sie</font>
<font color="yellow">an diesem Abend nichts Neues an!</font>
<font color="yellow">Da wird nie was draus."</font>
<font color="green">Und dann?</font>
<font color="yellow">Da habe ich Schluss gemacht und</font>
<font color="yellow">bin zu meiner Mutter gefahren.</font>
<font color="yellow">Das war's.</font>
<font color="green">Eine ergreifende Geschichte.</font>
<font color="yellow">Ich wusste, Sie verstehen mich.</font>
<font color="yellow">Das konnte niemand bisher.</font>
<font color="green">Nicht mal Ihre Mutter?</font>
<font color="yellow">Meine Mutter bat mich, bei Harry</font>
<font color="yellow">zu bleiben. Aber ich weigerte mich.</font>
<font color="yellow">Stellen Sie sich vor,</font>
<font color="yellow">ich hätte mal was von ihm verlangt.</font>
<font color="yellow">Zum Beispiel Geschirrspülen.</font>
<font color="yellow">Ich wollte keinen Mann,</font>
<font color="yellow">der an Horoskope glaubt.</font>
<font color="green">Da hatten Sie recht.</font>
<font color="yellow">Ich wollte einen richtigen Mann.</font>
<font color="green">Kein Mensch mit ein bisschen</font>
<font color="green">Erfahrung würde Ihnen das verübeln.</font>
<font color="yellow">Ich bin weggezogen. So konnte</font>
<font color="yellow">mich Harry nicht finden.</font>
<font color="yellow">Dann änderte ich meinen Namen.</font>
<font color="green">Aber er kam trotzdem.</font>
<font color="yellow">Heute Morgen stand er vor der Tür.</font>
<font color="yellow">Bevor ich aufmachte,</font>
<font color="yellow">wusste ich es, dass er es war.</font>
<font color="green">Was wollte er?</font>
<font color="yellow">Mich.</font>
<font color="yellow">Er hatte die alberne Idee,</font>
<font color="yellow">die Ehe zu vollziehen.</font>
<font color="yellow">Er sprach von Sehnsucht nach mir.</font>
<font color="yellow">Und von Einsamkeit.</font>
<font color="green">Was dachten Sie?</font>
<font color="yellow">Ich fand ihn hässlich mit den</font>
<font color="yellow">wenigen Haaren und dem Schnurrbart.</font>
<font color="green">Ja, aber da war er schon tot.</font>
<font color="yellow">Der sah lebend genauso</font>
<font color="yellow">aus, nur nicht so blass ...</font>
<font color="green">Wie haben Sie sich gewehrt?</font>
<font color="yellow">Ich schlug ihn mit der Milchflasche.</font>
<font color="green">Und dann?</font>
<font color="yellow">Dann machte er</font>
<font color="yellow">einen ruhigen Eindruck.</font>
<font color="yellow">Er lief in den Wald und sprach vom</font>
<font color="yellow">Sterben, sollte ich nicht mitkommen.</font>
<font color="green">Als ob er es ahnte.</font>
* Sie lacht. *
<font color="yellow">Noch Limonade?</font>
* Erstaunter Laut *
* Melancholische Musik *
<font color="magenta">Oh! Was für eine Überraschung!</font>
<font color="cyan">Sie haben mich eingeladen.</font>
<font color="cyan">Zumindest fasste ich das so auf.</font>
<font color="magenta">Ja, aber für mich ist es</font>
<font color="magenta">trotzdem eine Überraschung.</font>
<font color="cyan">Das ist schön. Man merkt,</font>
<font color="cyan">dass man willkommen ist.</font>
<font color="magenta">Kommen Sie herein.</font>
<font color="cyan">Vielen Dank für die Einladung.</font>
<font color="cyan">Ich freue mich sehr.</font>
* Verspielte Musik *
* Romantische Musik *
<font color="cyan">Die Blaubeer-Maultaschen</font>
<font color="cyan">schmecken sehr gut.</font>
<font color="cyan">Es kommt drauf an, dass die</font>
<font color="cyan">Blaubeeren gut verteilt sind.</font>
<font color="cyan">Es kommt allein auf</font>
<font color="cyan">die Blaubeeren an.</font>
<font color="cyan">Ich pflückte die Blaubeeren</font>
<font color="cyan">dort oben auf dem Hügel,</font>
<font color="cyan">wo Ihnen</font>
<font color="cyan">dieses Missgeschick passierte.</font>
<font color="cyan">Eine schöne Tasse für Männer!</font>
<font color="cyan">So handlich!</font>
<font color="magenta">Ein Erbstück. Sie gehörte</font>
<font color="magenta">meinem Vater - bis zu seinem Tod.</font>
<font color="cyan">Er starb sicher</font>
<font color="cyan">sehr sanft und friedlich.</font>
<font color="magenta">Er wurde von der Dreschmaschine</font>
<font color="magenta">zerstückelt.</font>
<font color="magenta">Das verdirbt Ihnen hoffentlich</font>
<font color="magenta">nicht den Appetit.</font>
<font color="cyan">Aber nein. Ich bin es gewohnt, die</font>
<font color="cyan">rauen Seiten des Lebens zu sehen.</font>
<font color="cyan">Ich bin ein Mann, der dem Tod</font>
<font color="cyan">schon oft ins Auge blickte.</font>
<font color="magenta">Ja, kürzlich erst wieder.</font>
<font color="cyan">Ja ...</font>
* Schritte *
<font color="magenta">Was bringst du uns, Arnie?</font>
Ein Kaninchen.
<font color="magenta">Wie heißt es denn?</font>
Es ist tot. Aber es gehört mir nicht.
<font color="cyan">Wem gehört es dann?</font>
Ihnen. Sie haben es geschossen.
<font color="magenta">Sie waren also nicht umsonst zur</font>
<font color="magenta">Jagd. Ich mache einen Braten daraus.</font>
<font color="cyan">Also hab ich nun doch ein Kaninchen.</font>
<font color="cyan">Wo hast du es gefunden?</font>
Da, wo die Blaubeer-Maultaschen wachsen ... auf dem Hügel.
<font color="magenta">Nimm dir eine Blaubeer-Maultasche</font>
<font color="magenta">fürs Kaninchen.</font>
Ein Kaninchen kostet aber zwei.
So, jetzt wird's aber Zeit.
<font color="cyan">Es ist wirklich ein schöner Tag.</font>
<font color="magenta">Ja, nicht wahr?</font>
<font color="cyan">Sie sind eine sehr nette Frau.</font>
<font color="magenta">Sie sind ein sehr netter Mann.</font>
<font color="magenta">Sprechen wir doch mal über</font>
<font color="magenta">unser Problemkind: Harry.</font>
<font color="magenta">Was wird aus ihm?</font>
<font color="cyan">Vergessen Sie ihn. Er wird</font>
<font color="cyan">noch vor Dunkelheit begraben.</font>
<font color="magenta">Das ist zu anstrengend.</font>
<font color="magenta">Wäre es nicht besser, Sie werfen</font>
<font color="magenta">ihn vom Bootssteg ins Wasser?</font>
<font color="cyan">Da taucht er wieder auf.</font>
<font color="cyan">Wer einen halben Meter Erde über</font>
<font color="cyan">sich hat, taucht nie wieder auf.</font>
<font color="cyan">Im Winter holt man Eis aus dem See.</font>
<font color="cyan">Was, wenn man ihn da dann findet?</font>
<font color="magenta">Sie haben vollkommen recht.</font>
<font color="magenta">War nur eine Idee.</font>
<font color="magenta">Harry muss unter die Erde.</font>
* Geheimnisvolle Musik *
<font color="cyan">Er sieht zufrieden aus.</font>
<font color="green">Wir sollten uns</font>
<font color="green">eine Stelle suchen und anfangen.</font>
<font color="green">Wir müssen uns beeilen.</font>
<font color="cyan">Stimmt das, was Sie von Mrs. Rogers</font>
<font color="cyan">und Ihrem Mann erzählten,</font>
<font color="cyan">bin ich einverstanden.</font>
<font color="green">Also dann, los!</font>
<font color="green">Wir nehmen eine Stelle,</font>
<font color="green">wo die Erde locker ist.</font>
<font color="cyan">Ja, und wo uns niemand stört.</font>
<font color="green">Wir suchen einen</font>
<font color="green">schönen Platz für sein Grab.</font>
<font color="cyan">Mit dem Gesicht nach Westen,</font>
<font color="cyan">zur untergehenden Sonne.</font>
<font color="green">Wo es im Winter nicht zu</font>
<font color="green">frostig ist.</font> <font color="cyan">- Und kühl im Sommer.</font>
<font color="cyan">Gefällt dir das, Harry?</font>
<font color="green">Den Gefallen müssen wir ihm tun,</font>
<font color="green">so, wie ich Ihnen auch einen tu.</font>
<font color="cyan">Vielen Dank für Ihre Hilfe.</font>
<font color="cyan">Ich werd mich revanchieren.</font>
<font color="green">Das hier ist ein guter Platz.</font>
<font color="cyan">Wir haben ein feines Plätzchen</font>
<font color="cyan">für dich, Harry.</font>
<font color="green">Ziehen Sie die Jacke aus.</font>
<font color="cyan">Ich?</font>
<font color="green">Natürlich, es ist Ihre Leiche.</font>
<font color="cyan">Ich hab kein Talent</font>
<font color="cyan">zum Grabschaufeln.</font>
<font color="green">Das hätten Sie sich</font>
<font color="green">vor der Jagd überlegen sollen.</font>
* Motorgeräusch *
<font color="cyan">Calvin Wiggs.</font>
<font color="cyan">Was erzählen wir dem?</font>
<font color="green">Überlegen Sie sich etwas.</font>
* Verspielte Musik *
* Sie stöhnen. *
<font color="cyan">Hören wir auf.</font>
<font color="green">Wollen Sie schon aufhören?</font>
<font color="cyan">Ich bin todmüde.</font>
<font color="green">Na gut. Ich bin auch müde.</font>
<font color="green">Ich wollte weiter graben,</font>
<font color="green">bis Sie aufgeben.</font>
<font color="cyan">Das macht mir Angst.</font>
<font color="green">Ja? Legen wir Harry hinein.</font>
<font color="cyan">Also dann, ruhe in Frieden.</font>
<font color="green">Wollen Sie einige Worte</font>
<font color="green">zum Abschied sagen?</font>
<font color="cyan">Das sollte ich wohl.</font>
<font color="cyan">Harry, komm nie wieder!</font>
* Motorgeräusch *
<font color="cyan">Wir verschwinden besser.</font>
<font color="green">Ich glaube,</font>
<font color="green">Calvin Wiggs sucht etwas.</font>
<font color="green">Ob er von Harry weiß?</font>
<font color="cyan">Ein furchtbarer Gedanke.</font>
<font color="green">Vllt. fragt er sich, wo Harry blieb.</font>
<font color="cyan">Wir müssen schnell fertig werden</font>
<font color="cyan">und hier weg.</font>
<font color="green">Hoffentlich schießen Sie von jetzt</font>
<font color="green">an nur noch auf Kaninchen.</font>
<font color="cyan">Ich habe heute schon</font>
<font color="cyan">ein Kaninchen geschossen.</font>
<font color="green">Nicht so laut! Das weiß ich.</font>
<font color="green">Ich war bei Jennifer.</font>
<font color="green">Da brachte es Arnie.</font>
<font color="cyan">Sie sagen schon "Jennifer"?</font>
<font color="cyan">Sie vergeuden keine Zeit.</font>
<font color="cyan">Das kann ich verstehen.</font>
<font color="cyan">Sie ist sicher eine hübsche Witwe.</font>
<font color="green">Das geht Sie nichts an.</font>
<font color="cyan">Regen Sie sich nicht auf.</font>
<font color="cyan">Wir müssen nicht über Ihre Affäre</font>
<font color="cyan">reden. Ich hab meine eigene.</font>
<font color="green">Meinen Sie meine Entdeckung?</font>
<font color="cyan">Wie?</font>
<font color="green">Miss Gravely. Der ich heute bei Mrs.</font>
<font color="green">Wiggs ein neues Gesicht verpasste.</font>
<font color="green">Eine bemerkenswerte Rückkehr</font>
<font color="green">zur Weiblichkeit.</font>
<font color="cyan">Was meinen Sie?</font>
<font color="green">Sie kam sehr aufgeregt in den Laden</font>
<font color="green">und wollte eine neue Kaffeetasse.</font>
<font color="green">Bei der Gelegenheit</font>
<font color="green">verpasste ich ihr</font>
<font color="green">ein neues Make-up und</font>
<font color="green">eine andere Frisur.</font>
<font color="green">Haben Sie das nicht gemerkt?</font>
<font color="cyan">Doch. Sie sah reizend aus.</font>
<font color="green">Na, nett sind wir alle.</font>
<font color="green">Man muss uns gern haben.</font>
<font color="cyan">Das Gefühl hab ich heute auch.</font>
<font color="cyan">Ich weiß nicht, ob ich alles durch</font>
<font color="cyan">'ne rosarote Brille sehe ...</font>
<font color="green">... oder ob Sie verliebt sind?!</font>
<font color="cyan">Die Liebe ist das Schönste</font>
<font color="cyan">auf der Welt.</font>
<font color="cyan">Durch sie kriegt unsere Arbeit</font>
<font color="cyan">den richtigen Schwung.</font>
<font color="green">Für heute war das genug Schwung.</font>
<font color="green">Ruhen wir uns aus.</font>
<font color="cyan">Wir haben es verdient.</font>
* Glockenläuten *
<font color="cyan">Was sagte Jennifer</font>
<font color="cyan">zu meiner Schießkunst?</font>
<font color="green">Sie meinen Mrs. Rogers?</font>
<font color="cyan">Wenn jemand sie beim Vornamen</font>
<font color="cyan">nennen darf, bin ich das.</font>
<font color="cyan">Durch meine Kugel ist sie</font>

<font color="green">"Schießen verboten"?</font>
<font color="cyan">Für "Schießen verboten" eine Kugel,</font>
<font color="cyan">für die Blechbüchse eine -</font>

<font color="green">Was ist mit dem Kaninchen?</font>
<font color="cyan">Eine für das Kanin...</font>
<font color="cyan">Och!</font>
<font color="cyan">Was ist denn mit Ihnen? Was ist los?</font>
<font color="cyan">Ich habe nur dreimal geschossen:</font>
<font color="cyan">Auf das Schild, auf die Büchse ...</font>
<font color="green">... und eine auf Harry.</font>
<font color="cyan">Nein!</font>
<font color="cyan">Eine auf das Kaninchen.</font>
<font color="cyan">Damit habe ich Harry</font>
<font color="cyan">nicht erschossen.</font>
<font color="cyan">Oh, was wollten Sie mir einreden?</font>
<font color="cyan">Sie dachten, ich bin ein Mörder.</font>
<font color="cyan">Sitzen Sie nicht rum,</font>
<font color="cyan">helfen Sie mir!</font>
<font color="cyan">Sie haben ihn mit vergraben.</font>
<font color="green">Warum wollen Sie ihn ausgraben?</font>
<font color="green">Ich versprach Jennifer,</font>
<font color="green">ihn zu begraben.</font>
<font color="green">Um mein Wort zu halten,</font>
<font color="green">soll das auch so bleiben.</font>
<font color="green">Ob Sie ihn töteten oder nicht,</font>
<font color="green">Sie machten sich schuldig.</font>
<font color="green">Wie wollen Sie Ihre</font>
<font color="green">Unschuld beweisen?</font>
<font color="green">Lassen wir es dabei, dass Sie ihn</font>
<font color="green">mit einem Karnickel verwechselten.</font>
<font color="green">Man vergräbt nicht einfach Leichen.</font>
<font color="green">Das erweckt Misstrauen.</font>
<font color="green">Man erwartet,</font>
<font color="green">dass Sie es der Polizei melden.</font>
<font color="cyan">Sie verstehen wirklich nicht,</font>
<font color="cyan">worum es geht.</font>
<font color="cyan">Ich will wissen,</font>
<font color="cyan">ob ich ihn getötet habe.</font>
* Scharren der Schaufel *
<font color="green">Sehr inkonsequent. Zuerst behaupten</font>
<font color="green">Sie, kein Gewissen zu haben und</font>
<font color="green">nun sagen Sie Dinge, die sich sehr</font>
<font color="green">nach einem Gewissen anhören.</font>
<font color="cyan">Bitte, helfen Sie mir! Mein Gewissen</font>
<font color="cyan">fühlt sich unschuldig an Harrys Tod.</font>
<font color="cyan">Aber ich werde immer Angst</font>
<font color="cyan">vor der Polizei haben.</font>
<font color="cyan">Das kann ich nicht ändern.</font>
<font color="green">Ich würd es lieber glauben als es zu</font>
<font color="green">beweisen, dass ich ein Mörder bin.</font>
<font color="cyan">Danke für die Hilfe. Zu zweit</font>
<font color="cyan">kriegen wir das Wrack schnell raus.</font>
* Verspielte Musik *
<font color="cyan">Ich kann nichts erkennen.</font>
<font color="cyan">Ich geh mal auf Tauchstation ...</font>
<font color="green">Das überlassen Sie besser mir!</font>
<font color="cyan">Wie Sie meinen.</font>
<font color="cyan">Ihre Augen sind sicher besser.</font>
<font color="green">Es ist keine Schusswunde.</font>
<font color="cyan">Sind Sie sich sicher?</font>
<font color="green">Ja.</font>
<font color="cyan">Ja, bitte.</font>
<font color="green">Harry bekam einen Schlag</font>
<font color="green">mit einem stumpfen Gegenstand.</font>
<font color="cyan">Was bedeutet das?</font>
<font color="green">Ich glaube ...</font>
<font color="green">... es war Mord.</font>
<font color="cyan">Mord?</font>
<font color="cyan">Wer ist der Mörder?</font>
<font color="green">Wer war es?</font>
<font color="cyan">Das mein ich ja: Wer es ist.</font>
<font color="cyan">Vielleicht Jennifer Rogers ...</font>
<font color="cyan">Wem war er sonst noch im Weg?</font>
<font color="green">Abgesehen von Jennifer?</font>
<font color="cyan">Halten Sie es für möglich, dass ...?</font>
<font color="green">Jennifer war es bestimmt nicht.</font>
<font color="green">Sie war von Harrys Tod überrascht.</font>
<font color="cyan">Sie hat ihn mit</font>
<font color="cyan">der Milchflasche geschlagen.</font>
<font color="cyan">Wir hatten einen Matrosen an Bord,</font>
<font color="cyan">der mit dem Schädel an</font>
<font color="cyan">eine Backsteinmauer gelaufen ist.</font>
<font color="cyan">Nach zwei Tagen war er tot.</font>
<font color="green">Seit wann gibt's auf 'nem Schiff</font>
<font color="green">eine Backsteinmauer?</font>
<font color="cyan">Ja, das fragten wir uns auch immer.</font>
<font color="green">Jennifer war es bestimmt nicht.</font>
<font color="green">Aber ist doch gleichgültig,</font>
<font color="green">wer es war.</font>
<font color="green">Wir graben ihn besser wieder ein.</font>
<font color="cyan">Ich habe keine Lust mehr.</font>
<font color="cyan">Ich will für andere nicht</font>
<font color="cyan">die Drecksarbeit machen.</font>
<font color="green">Vllt. war es Miss Gravely?</font>
* Wiles lacht ungläubig. *
<font color="green">Das ist nicht komisch. Warum war sie</font>
<font color="green">nicht erstaunt über den Toten?</font>
<font color="cyan">Sie ist eine feine Dame und</font>
<font color="cyan">wundert sich nie über etwas.</font>
<font color="cyan">Sie ist zu fein,</font>
<font color="cyan">ihre wahren Gefühle zu zeigen.</font>
<font color="cyan">Wenn Harry nicht da gewesen wäre,</font>
<font color="cyan">hätte sie ihn gar nicht erwähnt.</font>
<font color="cyan">Sie fragte zwar:</font>
<font color="cyan">"Haben Sie Probleme?"</font>
<font color="cyan">Das war eine reine Lady-Floskel.</font>
<font color="cyan">So wie: "Schöner Tag heute, nicht?"</font>
<font color="cyan">Irgendwas Belangloses.</font>
<font color="green">Graben wir ihn wieder ein?</font>
<font color="cyan">Ich weiß nicht.</font>
<font color="green">Vllt. war es Doktor Greenbow</font>
<font color="green">oder der Landstreicher.</font>
<font color="cyan">Oder Jennifer.</font>
<font color="green">Ach, Quatsch.</font>
<font color="green">Ich sagte Ihnen doch ...</font>
<font color="green">Es ist egal. Wir müssen</font>
<font color="green">ihn wieder eingraben.</font>
<font color="cyan">Also gut. Sie haben mir geholfen,</font>
<font color="cyan">jetzt helfe ich Ihnen.</font>
<font color="green">Damit werden wir Harry</font>
<font color="green">endgültig los.</font>
<font color="green">Dann ist Schluss mit Harry.</font>
* Friedvolle Musik *
<font color="cyan">Willkommen an Bord, Miss Gravely.</font>
<font color="cyan">Hier fand ein alter Seebär</font>
<font color="cyan">seinen letzten Ankerplatz.</font>
<font color="cyan">Natürlich nicht so schön wie Ihr</font>
<font color="cyan">Haus. Aber gemütlich, urgemüt...</font>
<font color="cyan">Wollen Sie nicht Platz nehmen?</font>
<font color="magenta">Vielen Dank.</font>
<font color="cyan">Ist merkwürdig, oder? Wir sind</font>
<font color="cyan">so schnell Freunde geworden.</font>
<font color="cyan">Ich wusste, dass Sie nicht wirklich</font>
<font color="cyan">so spröde und unnahbar sind.</font>
<font color="cyan">Das habe ich sofort gemerkt.</font>
<font color="magenta">Wirklich?</font>
<font color="cyan">Natürlich. Ich weiß die menschlichen</font>
<font color="cyan">Qualitäten einer Frau zu würdigen.</font>
<font color="cyan">Als wir uns das erste Mal trafen ...</font>
<font color="magenta">Käpt'n Wiles ...</font>
<font color="magenta">Ich unterbreche</font>
<font color="magenta">Ihre freundliche Rede nur ungern,</font>
<font color="magenta">aber ich sollte Ihnen erklären,</font>
<font color="magenta">warum ich Sie eingeladen habe.</font>
<font color="magenta">Ich muss Ihnen etwas gestehen ...</font>
<font color="cyan">Das ist nicht nötig.</font>
<font color="cyan">Sie haben mir in einer</font>
<font color="cyan">schwierigen Situation geholfen.</font>
<font color="cyan">Dafür bin ich Ihnen sehr dankbar.</font>
<font color="magenta">Vielen Dank, aber ...</font>
<font color="magenta">... ich schulde Ihnen</font>
<font color="magenta">eine Erklärung.</font>
<font color="cyan">Nein. Ich will</font>
<font color="cyan">kein Wort davon hören.</font>
<font color="cyan">Sie haben mich</font>
<font color="cyan">in einer prekären Situation</font>
<font color="cyan">mit einer Leiche überrascht.</font>
<font color="cyan">Und Sie waren</font>
<font color="cyan">so bewundernswert diskret.</font>
<font color="magenta">Käpt'n Wiles.</font>
<font color="magenta">Ich möchte Ihnen erklären,</font>
<font color="magenta">wieso ich Sie zu Kaffee und Blau-</font>
<font color="magenta">beer-Maultaschen eingeladen habe.</font>
<font color="magenta">Es war ...</font>
<font color="cyan">Sympathie?</font>
<font color="magenta">Dankbarkeit.</font>
<font color="cyan">Aber ich bin doch der,</font>
<font color="cyan">der dankbar sein muss.</font>
<font color="magenta">Nein, ich war ... bin Ihnen dankbar.</font>
<font color="magenta">Ich bin Ihnen dafür dankbar, dass</font>
<font color="magenta">Sie meine Leiche vergraben haben.</font>
<font color="cyan">Wieso Ihre?</font>
<font color="magenta">Sie denken, Sie brachten Harry um.</font>
<font color="magenta">Dabei warf ich ihm aus Verzweiflung</font>
<font color="magenta">meinen Wanderschuh</font>
<font color="magenta">an den Schädel und ...</font>
<font color="cyan">Und?</font>
<font color="magenta">... und ich schlug ihn</font>
<font color="magenta">mit meinem Spazierstock.</font>
<font color="cyan">Warum?</font>
<font color="magenta">Er hat mich überfallen.</font>
<font color="magenta">Ich kam zurück vom Blaubeersuchen,</font>
<font color="magenta">als er aus dem Gebüsch stürzte und</font>
<font color="magenta">mit einem wilden Ausdruck</font>
<font color="magenta">erklärte: "Wir sind verheiratet."</font>
<font color="cyan">Sie kannten ihn von früher?</font>
<font color="magenta">Ich hatte ihn noch nie gesehen.</font>
<font color="magenta">Und selbst wenn,</font>
<font color="magenta">hätte ich ihn nicht geheiratet.</font>
<font color="cyan">Er hat Sie sicher verwechselt.</font>
<font color="magenta">Er hat mich eindeutig absichtlich</font>
<font color="magenta">ins Gebüsch gezerrt.</font>
<font color="cyan">Ja?</font>
<font color="magenta">Ich konnte mich losreißen.</font>
<font color="cyan">Und dann?</font>
<font color="magenta">Er holte mich zurück.</font>
<font color="cyan">Also zweimal?</font>
<font color="magenta">Er beleidigte mich mit</font>
<font color="magenta">unanständigen Worten,</font>
<font color="magenta">die ich nicht verstand.</font>
<font color="cyan">Natürlich nicht.</font>
<font color="magenta">Wir kämpften.</font>
<font color="cyan">Und dann?</font>
<font color="magenta">Ich habe gewonnen.</font>
<font color="magenta">Aber ich verlor meinen Schuh ...</font>
<font color="magenta">Ich schlug ihn damit -</font>
<font color="magenta">und dann lag</font>
<font color="magenta">da mein Spazierstock ...</font>
<font color="cyan">... und damit töteten Sie ihn.</font>
<font color="magenta">Ja, so war das wohl.</font>
<font color="magenta">Ich war sehr erregt.</font>
<font color="cyan">Natürlich.</font>
<font color="magenta">Ich glaube, ich war nie so erregt.</font>
<font color="magenta">Dadurch bekam ich viel Kraft.</font>
<font color="cyan">Vielleicht haben Sie ihn zusammen</font>
<font color="cyan">mit Mrs. Rogers getötet.</font>
<font color="cyan">Kannte Mrs. Rogers Harry?</font>
<font color="magenta">Sie war wirklich mal seine Frau.</font>
<font color="magenta">Das tut mir leid.</font>
<font color="magenta">Ich traute ihr mehr Geschmack zu.</font>
<font color="magenta">Wissen Sie, Käpt'n.</font>
<font color="magenta">Eigentlich wollte ich niemandem</font>
<font color="magenta">etwas von</font>
<font color="magenta">dem schrecklichen Vorfall erzählen.</font>
<font color="magenta">Aber dann traf ich Sie.</font>
<font color="magenta">Und es kam mir wie gerufen, dass</font>
<font color="magenta">Sie dachten, Sie sind der Mörder.</font>
<font color="magenta">Verzeihen Sie meinen Egoismus.</font>
<font color="cyan">Das ist nur menschlich.</font>
<font color="magenta">Deswegen fühlte</font>
<font color="magenta">ich mich Ihnen verpflichtet.</font>
<font color="cyan">Ach, vergessen Sie's!</font>
<font color="magenta">Nein, Sie dürfen das nicht so abtun.</font>
<font color="magenta">Das wäre Ihnen gegenüber nicht fair.</font>
<font color="magenta">Sie sollten nicht mit dem Gedanken</font>
<font color="magenta">leben, jemanden getötet zu haben.</font>
<font color="magenta">Dann hätten Sie</font>
<font color="magenta">mein Verbrechen auf Ihrem Gewissen.</font>
<font color="cyan">Es wäre mir ein Vergnügen.</font>
<font color="magenta">Aber nicht doch.</font>
<font color="magenta">Jetzt wird mir klar,</font>
<font color="magenta">dass Harry verrückt war.</font>
<font color="magenta">Ich musste mich verteidigen.</font>
<font color="magenta">Ich gehe jetzt zur Polizei</font>
<font color="magenta">und erzähle alles.</font>
<font color="cyan">Warum?</font>
<font color="magenta">Der Fall muss geklärt werden.</font>
<font color="magenta">Die Polizei und Calvin Wiggs machen</font>
<font color="magenta">sicher kein großes Aufheben.</font>
<font color="magenta">Vllt. kommt es</font>
<font color="magenta">nicht mal in die Zeitung.</font>
<font color="cyan">Mord und Vergewaltigung ist auch</font>
<font color="cyan">für Zeitungen interessant.</font>
<font color="cyan">Vergessen Sie Harry.</font>
<font color="cyan">So wie Sam, Jennifer und ich.</font>
<font color="magenta">Aber das ist doch</font>
<font color="magenta">meine Sache, Käpt'n.</font>
<font color="magenta">Ich habe Harry getötet.</font>
<font color="magenta">Es ist meine Entscheidung.</font>
<font color="cyan">Ja, aber ...</font>
<font color="magenta">Ich wusste, dass Sie mir zustimmen.</font>
<font color="magenta">Wissen Sie, was wir jetzt machen?</font>
<font color="magenta">Jetzt holen wir</font>
<font color="magenta">erstmal einen Spaten.</font>
<font color="magenta">Zuerst graben wir Harry aus.</font>
<font color="magenta">Danach kommen Sie zu mir.</font>
* Geheimnisvolle Musik *
* Sam stöhnt. *
* Melancholische Musik *
<font color="yellow">Arnie ist so todmüde,</font>
<font color="yellow">dass er ständig schläft.</font>
<font color="green">Ihr Haus ist sehr schön.</font>
<font color="yellow">Das war das Beste,</font>
<font color="yellow">was ich mit Roberts</font>
<font color="yellow">Lebensversicherung machen konnte.</font>
<font color="yellow">Zucker?</font>
<font color="green">Nein, danke.</font>
<font color="yellow">Es ist komisch, aber ...</font>
<font color="yellow">... ich bin gern mit Ihnen zusammen.</font>
<font color="green">Mir geht es genauso.</font>
<font color="green">Es ist ein schönes Gefühl,</font>
<font color="green">wenn man jemanden gern hat,</font>
<font color="green">der einen auch gern hat.</font>
<font color="yellow">Es gibt noch ein Problem.</font>
<font color="green">Sagen Sie mir, was es ist,</font>
<font color="green">und ich löse es für Sie.</font>
<font color="yellow">Was machen wir mit Harry?</font>
<font color="green">Schon erledigt.</font>
<font color="green">Vergessen Sie ihn!</font>
<font color="green">Er ist im Jenseits.</font>
<font color="green">Eigentlich ist er unter der Erde ...</font>
<font color="green">Harry ist Vergangenheit.</font>
* Türklopfen *
<font color="yellow">Ja, bitte? Die Tür ist offen.</font>
<font color="green">Was ist mit Ihnen los?</font>
<font color="cyan">Sam, ich muss Ihnen etwas sagen.</font>
<font color="magenta">Nicht doch, Käpt'n.</font>
<font color="magenta">Ich muss Ihnen etwas sagen.</font>
<font color="green">Wer erzählt uns jetzt was?</font>
<font color="magenta">Ich habe Harry Warp getötet -</font>
<font color="magenta">mit meinem Spazierstock.</font>
<font color="yellow">Sie waren das?</font> <font color="magenta">- Wir sind gerade</font>
<font color="magenta">auf dem Weg zu Calvin Wiggs.</font>
<font color="magenta">Wir gehen jetzt besser zur Polizei.</font>
<font color="cyan">Ich sagte ihr, das hätte wenig Sinn.</font>
<font color="green">Da hat er recht.</font>
<font color="green">Harry ist tot und begraben.</font>
<font color="cyan">Sam, ich muss Ihnen noch was sagen.</font>
<font color="green">Haben Sie ihn wieder ausgegraben?</font>
<font color="cyan">Ich ...</font>
* Unheimliche Musik *
<font color="magenta">Ich bestand darauf, Mr. Marlowe.</font>
<font color="green">Aber verstehen Sie nicht,</font>
<font color="green">was das heißt?</font>
<font color="magenta">Machen Sie sich keine Gedanken.</font>
<font color="magenta">Das betrifft nur mich.</font>
<font color="magenta">Käpt'n Wiles hat mir beim Kaffee</font>
<font color="magenta">von Harry erzählt.</font>
<font color="magenta">Das hat mich beruhigt.</font>
<font color="yellow">Sie wissen alles über Harry?</font>
<font color="magenta">Ich fürchte ja.</font>
<font color="magenta">Ich glaube aber kaum, dass man eine</font>
<font color="magenta">Dame und einen Triebtäter verbindet.</font>
<font color="green">Sie werden sich wundern. Sie wissen</font>
<font color="green">wohl nicht, was Mord bedeutet.</font>
<font color="green">Die Polizei behandelt Sie vielleicht</font>
<font color="green">trotzdem wie eine Mörderin.</font>
<font color="green">In der Zeitung steht dann alles</font>
<font color="green">über Ihr Privatleben.</font>
<font color="magenta">Wieso glauben Sie, man könne mein</font>
<font color="magenta">Privatleben in den Schmutz ziehen?</font>
<font color="green">So meine ich das nicht.</font>
<font color="green">Sie missverstehen mich.</font>
<font color="green">Diese Presseleute aber sorgen dafür,</font>
<font color="green">dass Sie schlecht wegkommen.</font>
<font color="magenta">Ich bin trotzdem entschlossen.</font>
<font color="cyan">Das kann man wohl sagen.</font>
<font color="magenta">Käpt'n Wiles überredete mich,</font>
<font color="magenta">zu Ihnen zu kommen, Mrs. Rogers.</font>
<font color="magenta">Und Sie über</font>
<font color="magenta">mein Vorhaben zu informieren.</font>
<font color="magenta">Sie sind ja am meisten</font>
<font color="magenta">in die Sache mit Harry verwickelt.</font>
<font color="magenta">Was meinen Sie, Mrs. Rogers?</font>
<font color="yellow">Warum machen Sie sich</font>
<font color="yellow">so viele Gedanken um Harry?</font>
<font color="yellow">Warum haben Sie Harry</font>
<font color="yellow">wieder ausgegraben?</font>
<font color="yellow">Aber da Sie es taten, tun Sie</font>
<font color="yellow">weiter, was Sie für richtig halten.</font>
<font color="yellow">Harry interessiert mich nicht mehr.</font>
<font color="magenta">Also habe ich freie Hand?</font>
<font color="yellow">Wenn Sie unbedingt wollen.</font>
<font color="yellow">Soweit es mich betrifft,</font>
<font color="yellow">ist es finsterste Vergangenheit.</font>
<font color="green">Ich glaub,</font>
<font color="green">da haben Sie was übersehen.</font>
<font color="green">Sollte die ganze Sache rauskommen,</font>
<font color="green">will man dann auch alles</font>
<font color="green">über Ihre Ehe mit Harry wissen.</font>
<font color="yellow">Oh ...</font>
<font color="magenta">Daran habe ich nicht gedacht.</font>
<font color="green">Wo liegt Harry?</font>
<font color="cyan">Hinter der großen Eiche.</font>
<font color="green">Ich hole eine Schaufel.</font>
<font color="magenta">Ich mach Ihnen schrecklich</font>
<font color="magenta">viele Umstände, tut mir leid.</font>
<font color="green">Schon gut.</font>
<font color="yellow">Gehen wir alle zusammen.</font>
<font color="yellow">Ich hatte weniger Ärger mit Harry,</font>
<font color="yellow">als er noch lebte.</font>
<font color="cyan">Mir reicht's.</font>
<font color="cyan">Drei Beerdigungen an einem Tag ...</font>
<font color="cyan">Alle an einem Tag.</font>
* Glockenläuten *
<font color="green">Bringen wir die Sache</font>
<font color="green">schnell hinter uns.</font> <font color="cyan">- Ja.</font>
* Unheimliche Musik *
* Elegante Musik *
<font color="cyan">Am praktischsten wäre es,</font>
<font color="cyan">wenn wir ihn einzementieren.</font>
<font color="magenta">Im Frühjahr pflanze ich hier</font>
<font color="magenta">Blaubeerbüsche.</font>
<font color="cyan">Ach, großer Gott,</font>
<font color="cyan">warum nicht Vergissmeinnicht?</font>
<font color="green">Die Natur wird sich</font>
<font color="green">schon drum kümmern.</font>
<font color="cyan">Wie wär's mit einer Feier?</font> <font color="green">- Ich</font>
<font color="green">wüsste nicht, was ich sagen soll.</font>
<font color="yellow">Jedes Gerede ist überflüssig. Was</font>
<font color="yellow">getan werden musste, ist geschehen.</font>
<font color="yellow">Auf Wiedersehen, Harry.</font>
<font color="yellow">Ich vergebe dir.</font>
* Hupen *
<font color="cyan">Die hupen doch nicht wegen Harry?</font>
<font color="yellow">Die kannten ihn nicht.</font>
<font color="green">So möchte ich Sie</font>
<font color="green">gern malen, Jennifer.</font>
<font color="green">Es ist ein hübscher Anblick,</font>
<font color="green">wie Sie im Mondlicht stehen.</font>
<font color="cyan">Was ist da los im Dorf?</font>
<font color="magenta">Ich weiß es.</font>
<font color="magenta">Es ist die Gespensterkutsche.</font>
<font color="magenta">Vor 200 Jahren kam sie jede Nacht.</font>
<font color="cyan">(Lachend) Gespensterkutsche.</font>
<font color="magenta">Die alte Fahrstrecke führte</font>
<font color="magenta">da drüben mitten über den Hügel.</font>
<font color="yellow">Hört ihr? Da kommt jemand angerannt.</font>
<font color="magenta">Pferde!</font>
(Frauenstimme) Sam!
<font color="green">Das Pferd ruft nach mir.</font>
<font color="cyan">Was will sie?</font>
<font color="yellow">Wissen wir gleich. Sie kommt.</font>
<font color="green">Das ist Wiggie.</font>
<font color="green">Die alte Wiggie.</font>
(Mrs. Wiggs) Mister Marlowe!
Mister Marlowe!
<font color="green">Was ist los?</font>
Sie ... er will ...
<font color="green">Immer mit der Ruhe.</font>
Er ist ein Millionär ...
<font color="green">Wer?</font>
Er will alle Ihre Bilder kaufen.
<font color="green">Welche Bilder?</font>
Ihre. Und er will noch mehr haben.
Er sagt, Sie sind ein Genie.
<font color="green">Da hat er recht.</font>
<font color="green">Das ist doch kein Grund,</font>
<font color="green">meine Bilder zu kaufen.</font>
<font color="magenta">Sind Sie nicht neugierig?</font>
Nutzen Sie die Chance!
<font color="green">Gut, ich rede mit ihm.</font>
<font color="green">Wir gruben ein bisschen.</font>
<font color="cyan">Sassafraswurzel.</font>
(Mrs. Wiggs) Sassafrastee ist sehr heilsam.
Mein Mann schwor darauf, davon gesund zu werden.
<font color="cyan">Was will der Millionär</font>
<font color="cyan">für die Bilder zahlen?</font>
Ich verlangte sieben Dollar für das eine, das aussieht wie Farbkleckse im Gewittersturm.
Er sagt: Die Bilder sind unbezahlbar.
<font color="cyan">So was malte ich schon</font>
<font color="cyan">im Kindergarten.</font>
<font color="green">Das Bild ist ein Symbol</font>
<font color="green">für den Beginn der Welt.</font>
<font color="cyan">Im Kindergarten fing</font>
<font color="cyan">die Welt für mich auch an.</font>
(Mann) Mein Freund ist Kunstkritiker, er versteht moderne Kunst.
<font color="green">Ich brauche keine Kritiker.</font>
Tatsächlich?
<font color="green">Meine Bilder sind gut.</font>
<font color="green">Und er will sie nicht kaufen,</font>
<font color="green">sondern Sie.</font>
<font color="green">Also, gefallen sie Ihnen?</font>
Ich finde sie großartig und will alle Bilder kaufen.
<font color="green">Pech für Sie.</font>
Warum?
<font color="green">Ich verkaufe sie nicht.</font>
<font color="green">Sie sind unbezahlbar.</font>
<font color="green">Geld.</font>
<font color="cyan">Seien Sie vernünftig.</font>
<font color="cyan">Ziehen Sie ihm was aus der Nase!</font>
Was soll denn das?
Das ist eine einmalige Chance.
Nennen Sie den Preis und ich zahle.
<font color="green">Was meinen Sie?</font>
* Glockenschlag *
<font color="yellow">Sie müssen selbst entscheiden.</font>
<font color="green">Na schön. Was mögen Sie am liebsten?</font>
<font color="yellow">Ich weiß nicht ...</font>
<font color="yellow">Erdbeeren.</font>
Was?
<font color="green">Erdbeeren. Notieren Sie das.</font>
<font color="green">Schicken Sie jeden Monat</font>
<font color="green">zwei Kartons frische Erdbeeren.</font>
<font color="green">Das ganze Jahr hindurch.</font>
Das wird erledigt. Sonst noch was?
<font color="green">Was wünscht sich Arnie?</font>
<font color="yellow">Ein Chemielabor für Kinder.</font>
<font color="green">Ein bestimmtes?</font>
<font color="yellow">Egal, Hauptsache, es stinkt.</font>
<font color="green">Schreiben Sie das auf!</font>
Na gut, ein übelriechendes Chemielabor.
<font color="green">Was möchten Sie, Wiggie?</font>
Eine Kasse mit einer Klingel.
<font color="green">Haben Sie dafür noch Platz?</font>
Ich finde schon einen.
Also eine Registrierkrasse?
- Mit einer Klingel und verchromt.
<font color="green">Miss Gravely, einen Schminkkoffer,</font>
<font color="green">komplett eingerichtet.</font> <font color="cyan">- Wozu?</font>
<font color="magenta">Eine Truhe für die Aussteuer -</font>
<font color="magenta">mit allem, was eine Frau haben</font>
<font color="magenta">müsste und was ich nicht habe.</font>
Eine Truhe für die Aussteuer, mit allem Drum und Dran.
<font color="green">Und Sie, Käpt'n?</font>
<font color="cyan">Ein ordentliches Gewehr</font>
<font color="cyan">mit viel Munition,</font>
<font color="cyan">ein paar derbe Cordhosen, eine Mütze</font>
<font color="cyan">für die Jagd und ein Jagdhemd.</font>
<font color="cyan">Bitte alles in Braun.</font>
Also, ich notiere.
Eine braune Jagdausrüstung.
<font color="green">Das wär's.</font>
<font color="green">Jetzt gehören die Bilder Ihnen.</font>
Und Sie?
<font color="yellow">Sie müssen sich auch etwas wünschen.</font>
<font color="green">Mal sehen ...</font>
* Gefühlvolle Musik *
<font color="green">Das ist es.</font>
<font color="yellow">Was denn?</font>
<font color="green">Entschuldigt bitte.</font>
* Er flüstert. *
<font color="green">Was meinen Sie?</font>
Ich denke, dass man das arrangieren kann.
Bitte, das wäre dann alles.
Morgen kommt jemand und holt die Bilder.
Mr. Marlowe ...
Diese Nacht werde ich nie vergessen.
<font color="green">Kommen Sie wieder, nächsten Monat</font>
<font color="green">hab ich sicherlich wieder Bilder.</font>
Ich werde ein ständiger Abnehmer sein.
Selbst wenn Sie Ihre Preise erhöhen.
So, dann wünsche ich eine gute Nacht.
(Alle) Auf Wiedersehen.
(Mann) Das war eine amüsante
Verkaufsverhandlung.
<font color="cyan">Gratuliere.</font>
<font color="cyan">Das haben Sie gut gemacht.</font>
<font color="green">Waren Sie auch damit einverstanden?</font>
<font color="yellow">Das war toll.</font>
<font color="green">Vielen Dank.</font>
<font color="green">Mir ist es wichtig,</font>
<font color="green">dass Sie das sagen.</font> <font color="yellow">- Wieso?</font>
<font color="green">Ich liebe Sie.</font>
<font color="green">Ich möchte Sie heiraten.</font>
<font color="yellow">Sie wollen mich heiraten?</font>
<font color="green">Ja, warum nicht?</font>
<font color="yellow">Ich habe erst seit heute</font>
<font color="yellow">meine Freiheit wieder.</font>
<font color="green">Wie gewonnen, so zerronnen.</font>
<font color="green">Sie behalten Ihre Freiheit bei mir.</font>
<font color="yellow">Dann sind Sie der einzige Mann,</font>
<font color="yellow">mit dem das geht.</font>
<font color="green">Ich brauche selbst auch Freiheit.</font>
<font color="green">Wir sind dann vllt. das einzige</font>
<font color="green">freie Ehepaar auf der ganzen Welt.</font>
<font color="yellow">Das geht so schnell.</font>
<font color="yellow">Meine Mutter sagte,</font>
<font color="yellow">ich muss mir das gut überlegen.</font>
<font color="green">Da hat Sie völlig recht.</font>
<font color="green">Überlegen Sie auf dem Heimweg.</font>
* Türklingel *
(Calvin) Was ist hier los?
(Mrs. Wiggs) Mister Marlowe hat seine
Bilder an einen Millionär verkauft.
Er bekam mehr, als ich dachte.
- Geld?
Na ja, kann man nicht direkt sagen.
Ich wusste immer, dass der Plunder nichts wert ist.
Die hier habe ich einem Landstreicher abgenommen.
Er hat sie angeblich bei einem Toten gefunden.
Er führte mich zu der Stelle.
Aber die Leiche war nicht mehr da.
* Wählgeräusch *
(Calvin) Montpellier 2000.
(Mrs. Wiggs) Ist das die Nummer der Staatspolizei? - Ja.
<font color="green">Ich schätze, wir gehen jetzt.</font>
(Mrs. Wiggs) Danke für die Registrierkasse, Mr. Marlowe.
<font color="green">Sehr gern. Gute Nacht.</font>
(Alle nacheinander) Gute Nacht.
<font color="cyan">Wiedersehen.</font>
(Mrs. Wiggs) Wiedersehen, Käpt'n.
* Tür fällt zu. *
Ja, hier ist Sheriff Calvin Wiggs.
Ja, ich warte.
* Geheimnisvolle Musik *
Mutter?
Ja?
Wer hat dieses Bild gemalt?
Er malte es heute im Wald, aber es ist unverkäuflich.
Warum denn?
- Da musst du ihn selbst fragen.
Er ließ es hier, weil er noch zu Mrs. Rogers wollte.
Er hatte wohl keine Zeit, es nach Hause zu bringen.
Interessierst du dich für Kunst?
Nein, aber ...
Ich weiß nicht, aber das passt auf die Beschreibung, die ...
Hallo, Kommissar.
Calvin Wiggs.
Ich hab etwas, das sie vllt. interessiert.
Ein Landstreicher hat mir gerade eine seltsame Geschichte erzählt.
Von einem Toten ...
* Ruhige Musik *
<font color="cyan">Hey! Was halten Sie davon?</font>
<font color="cyan">Erst kommt er mit Harrys Schuhen und</font>
<font color="cyan">dann ruft er die Staatspolizei an.</font>
<font color="green">Keine Ahnung.</font>
<font color="green">Uns hat er nicht in Verdacht.</font>
<font color="cyan">Er sah mich so merkwürdig an.</font>
<font color="green">Ahnte er was,</font>
<font color="green">würde er uns nicht laufen lassen.</font>
<font color="cyan">Vielleicht ist das</font>
<font color="cyan">ein psychologischer Trick.</font>
<font color="cyan">Die Polizei kennt viele Tricks</font>
<font color="cyan">und macht dich mürbe.</font>
<font color="cyan">Bis man dankbar ist,</font>
<font color="cyan">dass sie einen aufknöpft.</font>
<font color="green">Er macht sich nur wichtig.</font>
<font color="green">Die Polizei wird ihm sagen,</font>
<font color="green">er soll die Schuhe behalten.</font>
<font color="cyan">Wenn Sie meinen.</font>
* Melancholische Musik *
<font color="yellow">Ich habe es mir überlegt.</font>
<font color="green">Was denn?</font>
<font color="yellow">Na, ich heirate Sie.</font>
<font color="yellow">Falls Sie Ihren Antrag</font>
<font color="yellow">nicht vergessen haben.</font>
<font color="yellow">Sie sind ganz sympathisch.</font>
<font color="yellow">Und Arnie braucht einen guten Vater.</font>
<font color="yellow">Und über die anderen Gründe</font>
<font color="yellow">möchte ich lieber nicht sprechen.</font>
<font color="cyan">Ist man verheiratet,</font>
<font color="cyan">kommt man besser durch den Winter.</font>
<font color="cyan">Was erzählen wir aber</font>
<font color="cyan">nun der Staatspolizei?</font>
<font color="green">Ob du's glaubst oder nicht.</font>
<font color="green">Ich hätte es fast wieder vergessen.</font>
<font color="yellow">Ich hab dafür Zeugen.</font>
<font color="green">Jetzt fällt es mir wieder ein.</font>
<font color="green">Jennifer, jetzt hast du</font>
<font color="green">wieder einen Mann.</font>
<font color="green">Das ist der Beweis.</font>
* Romantische Musik *
<font color="yellow">Nur ganz leicht.</font>
<font color="yellow">Ich hab 'nen niedrigen Siedepunkt.</font>
<font color="magenta">Ist das nicht schön?</font>
<font color="cyan">Ja.</font>
<font color="yellow">Was hast du dir</font>
<font color="yellow">von dem Millionär gewünscht?</font>
* Er flüstert. *
<font color="yellow">Das ist praktisch.</font>
<font color="magenta">Herzlichen Glückwunsch!</font>
<font color="yellow">Danke.</font>
<font color="cyan">Sie sind zu beneiden.</font>
<font color="cyan">Sicher werden Sie sehr glücklich.</font>
<font color="cyan">Entschuldigen Sie meine</font>
<font color="cyan">manchmal mürrische Art.</font>
<font color="cyan">Harry ist endlich begraben.</font>
<font color="cyan">Die Mühe hat sich gelohnt.</font>
<font color="cyan">Kann ich irgendwas für Sie tun?</font>
<font color="green">Mist, wir haben etwas vergessen!</font>
<font color="yellow">Was hast du denn?</font>
<font color="green">Harry!</font>
<font color="green">Wir sind noch nicht fertig mit ihm.</font>
<font color="yellow">Wie kommst du darauf?</font>
<font color="yellow">Wir begruben ihn dreimal.</font>
<font color="green">Damit wir heiraten können, musst du</font>
<font color="green">beweisen, dass du frei bist.</font>
<font color="green">Und dafür musst du beweisen ...</font>
<font color="yellow">... dass er tot ist.</font>
<font color="yellow">Das wird mir zu kompliziert.</font>
<font color="magenta">Oh!</font>
<font color="magenta">Ich finde das nicht so schlimm.</font>
<font color="cyan">Warum sehen Sie mich so an?</font>
<font color="cyan">Oh.</font>
<font color="cyan">Sam, ich tu alles für Sie.</font>
<font color="cyan">Aber verlangen Sie nicht von mir,</font>
<font color="cyan">Harry wieder rauszuholen!</font>
<font color="magenta">Aber was haben Sie denn?</font>
<font color="yellow">Nein, das geht nicht.</font>
<font color="magenta">Wegen der schmutzigen</font>
<font color="magenta">Presse über Ihre Ehe?</font> <font color="yellow">- Nein.</font>
<font color="yellow">Sam wäre mir jedes Opfer wert.</font>
<font color="yellow">Ich denke mehr an Sie, Miss Gravely.</font>
<font color="yellow">Mord ist Mord. Auch wenn vieles</font>
<font color="yellow">entlastend ist, bleibt was hängen.</font>
<font color="yellow">Und es wäre</font>
<font color="yellow">nicht erfreulich für Sie.</font>
<font color="cyan">Genau. Wir lassen ihn da, wo er ist.</font>
<font color="cyan">Sie müssen nur sieben Jahre warten,</font>
<font color="cyan">bis er für tot erklärt wird.</font>
<font color="green">Sieben Jahre? Dann bin ich alt.</font>
<font color="yellow">Du hast schon viel länger gewartet.</font>
<font color="green">Ja, aber ich wusste nicht, worauf.</font>
<font color="magenta">Ich bestehe darauf,</font>
<font color="magenta">dass Sie diesen Harry ausgraben.</font>
<font color="magenta">Ist mir egal, was die sagen.</font>
<font color="magenta">Mich kann nur ein Verrückter</font>
<font color="magenta">überfallen. Das sieht doch jeder.</font>
<font color="cyan">Das stimmt nicht.</font>
<font color="magenta">Meinen Sie das ernst, Käpt'n Wiles?</font>
<font color="cyan">Also gut.</font>
<font color="cyan">Graben wir ihn wieder aus.</font>
<font color="cyan">Los! Wir müssen schneller sein</font>
<font color="cyan">als die Polizei.</font>
<font color="yellow">Wisst ihr was?</font>
<font color="yellow">Was haltet ihr davon, wenn wir</font>
<font color="yellow">vergessen, was wirklich passierte?</font>
<font color="yellow">Ich sage nur, Harry besuchte mich</font>
<font color="yellow">und rannte plötzlich weg.</font>
<font color="yellow">Ich wunderte mich zwar,</font>
<font color="yellow">aber ich wusste von nichts.</font>
<font color="magenta">Tun Sie das nicht! Die Polizei</font>
<font color="magenta">verdächtigt sonst jemand anderen.</font>
<font color="magenta">Der dann vllt.</font>
<font color="magenta">keine so gute Entschuldigung hat.</font>
<font color="green">Wen meinen Sie?</font>
<font color="magenta">Hier gibt es zwei Personen,</font>
<font color="magenta">die einen guten Grund gehabt hätten.</font>
<font color="magenta">Jennifer wollte Harry loswerden.</font>
<font color="magenta">Und Sam auch.</font>
<font color="green">Ich? Warum sollte ich ihn umbringen?</font>
<font color="green">Aus welchem Grund?</font>
<font color="magenta">Ich wüsste da schon einen.</font>
<font color="yellow">Sie meint mich.</font>
<font color="magenta">Ja.</font>
<font color="green">Aber ich verliebte mich erst in sie,</font>
<font color="green">nachdem ich Harry begrub.</font>
<font color="magenta">Erklären Sie das mal der Polizei.</font>
<font color="cyan">Sie hat recht.</font>
<font color="yellow">Wir sagen besser die Wahrheit -</font>
<font color="yellow">soweit noch vorhanden.</font>
<font color="green">Die Polizei fragt sicher:</font>
<font color="green">Warum kamen Sie nicht sofort?</font>
<font color="cyan">Ja, und seinen Zustand</font>
<font color="cyan">müssen wir auch erklären.</font>
<font color="yellow">Er sieht etwas ramponiert aus.</font>
<font color="yellow">Wir müssen ihn sauber machen.</font>
<font color="yellow">Man glaubt Miss Gravely sonst nicht.</font>
<font color="magenta">Die Verzögerung</font>
<font color="magenta">könnte ich dadurch erklären,</font>
<font color="magenta">dass ich einen Schock bekam,</font>
<font color="magenta">und nicht wusste, was zu tun ist.</font>
<font color="cyan">Das versteht jeder.</font>
<font color="green">Dann brauchten Sie aber sehr lange.</font>
<font color="yellow">Wir haben keine Zeit</font>
<font color="yellow">für Diskussionen.</font>
<font color="yellow">Lass uns Harry irgendwo hinbringen,</font>
<font color="yellow">wo wir ihn sauber machen.</font>
* Undeutliche Stimme *
<font color="cyan">Volldampf voraus!</font>
* Verspielte Musik *
* Männerstimme spricht undeutlich. *
(Dr. Greenbow) "... ein Licht in der Finsternis ...
... bis an den Rand des Abgrunds ...
Und soll man dies als Irrtum hier beweisen, so schrieb ich dies als Mann, der nie geliebt ..."
* Bedrohliche Musik *
"Wie hieß der Stern, der uns führt, wenn uns die Finsternis umgibt ..."
<font color="green">Er hatte so was wie einen Unfall,</font>
<font color="green">Dr. Greenbow.</font>
(Dr. Greenbow) Das sieht ganz so aus.
Wer hat ihn gefunden?
<font color="green">Wer ...?</font>
<font color="yellow">Er war mein Mann.</font>
Ich wusste nicht, dass Sie verheiratet waren.
Mein Beileid.
<font color="yellow">Ist schon gut.</font>
<font color="yellow">Das Leben kann hart sein.</font>
Was ist mit ihm passiert?
<font color="yellow">Er musste ...</font>
<font color="green">Das wissen wir nicht.</font>
<font color="green">Können Sie ihn untersuchen?</font>
<font color="green">Er fiel einfach um.</font>
Hier ist es zu dunkel.
<font color="green">Wir können ihn irgendwo hinbringen,</font>
<font color="green">wo Sie ihn besser sehen.</font>
Also gut, wohin bringen Sie ihn?
<font color="yellow">Zu mir nach Hause.</font>
So kehrt er zum letzten Mal heim.
<font color="yellow">Das passt mir gar nicht.</font>
<font color="cyan">Kommen Sie, fügen wir</font>
<font color="cyan">uns in das Unvermeidliche.</font>
<font color="magenta">Die Schaufeln</font>
<font color="magenta">brauchen wir ja nicht mehr.</font>
* Bedrückende Musik *
* Düstere Musik *
<font color="green">Ich mach die Hosenträger wieder ran.</font>
<font color="yellow">Dass es noch nass ist,</font>
<font color="yellow">stört ihn sicher nicht.</font>
<font color="yellow">Ich bügle es nur schnell über.</font>
<font color="yellow">Das ist eigenartig.</font>
<font color="yellow">Früher tat ich nichts für Harry</font>
<font color="yellow">und jetzt bügle ich seine Hemden.</font>
* Verspielte Musik *
* Unheimliche Musik *
* Käpt'n Wiles schreit. *
<font color="cyan">Da!</font>
<font color="magenta">Kein Grund zur Aufregung.</font>
<font color="magenta">Das ist nur ein Schrank.</font>
<font color="cyan">Ich dachte, Harry kommt.</font>
<font color="green">Ganz ruhig.</font>
<font color="green">Schlafen Sie noch 'ne Runde.</font>
<font color="magenta">Was ist mit der Wunde, die ich ihm</font>
<font color="magenta">mit meinem Stock verpasste?</font>
<font color="yellow">Wir kleben ein Pflaster darauf.</font>
<font color="yellow">Vllt. glaubt man,</font>
<font color="yellow">dass er es vorher hatte.</font>
<font color="green">Gleich sind wir fertig.</font>
* Motorgeräusche *
<font color="cyan">Ist das ...?</font>
<font color="green">Das ist Calvin Wiggs.</font>
* Geheimnisvolle Musik *
* Er klingelt. *
<font color="yellow">Ich öffne gleich.</font>
<font color="yellow">Das ist aber eine Überraschung.</font>
Kann ich Sam sprechen?
<font color="yellow">Ja, der ist da.</font>
Kann ich ihn kurz sprechen?
<font color="yellow">Sicher.</font>
<font color="yellow">Sam, Calvin Wiggs</font>
<font color="yellow">will dich sprechen.</font>
<font color="green">Ich komme gleich.</font>
<font color="yellow">Er sagt, er kommt gleich.</font>
Lassen Sie mich hinein.
<font color="cyan">Guten Abend, Calvin.</font>
Guten Abend, Käpt'n.
Miss Gravely.
<font color="cyan">Pech für Sie,</font>
<font color="cyan">wir haben Pik ausgespielt.</font>
<font color="cyan">Wenn wir nur</font>
<font color="cyan">mit Karo rausgekommen wären.</font>
<font color="cyan">Spielen Sie auch Bridge?</font>
Nein.
<font color="cyan">Dachte ich mir.</font>
<font color="green">Was wollen Sie?</font>
Wo waren Sie heute?
<font color="green">Ich malte.</font> <font color="white">- Waren Sie</font> in der Nähe der Mansfield Wiese?
<font color="green">Kann sein. Ich mache dort</font>
<font color="green">manchmal Skizzen. Wieso?</font>
Haben Sie da vielleicht ...
... dieses Bild gemalt?
<font color="green">Ich ließ das Porträt</font>
<font color="green">bei Ihrer Mutter.</font>
<font color="green">Was machen Sie mit meinem Bild?</font>
<font color="green">Es könnte beschädigt werden.</font>
<font color="cyan">Sams Bilder sind unbezahlbar.</font>
Dann schicke ich Ihnen dafür an jedem ersten Blaubeeren.
Sam, wo haben Sie das gemalt und wer ist das?
<font color="green">Also, zunächst nicht gemalt,</font>
<font color="green">sondern gezeichnet.</font>
<font color="green">Das ist eine Pastellzeichnung.</font>
<font color="green">Das Gesicht habe ich frei erfunden.</font>
Was Sie nicht sagen.
<font color="green">Warum interessiert Sie das?</font>
Der Landstreicher mit den geklauten Schuhen sagte, dass er sie einem Toten abnahm.
Er beschrieb ihn genau und die Beschreibung deckt sich völlig mit diesem Bild.
<font color="magenta">Ich bitte Sie, glauben Sie</font>
<font color="magenta">einem betrunkenen Landstreicher?</font>
Ich sperrte den Kerl ein.
Und ich zeigte ihm das Gemälde.
<font color="green">Die Zeichnung, meinen Sie.</font>
Von mir aus, die Zeichnung.
Er wurde fast ohnmächtig und sagte:
Besser als ein Foto.
Also, wer ist das?
<font color="green">Flog mir</font>
<font color="green">aus dem Unterbewusstsein zu.</font>
Nehmen Sie's nicht persönlich, aber ich glaube Ihnen nicht.
<font color="cyan">Durch dieses Gequatsche kam ich ganz</font>
<font color="cyan">raus. Ich gehe jetzt nach Hause.</font>
<font color="cyan">Bis morgen.</font>
* Tür fällt zu. *
<font color="green">Warum glauben Sie mir nicht?</font>
Ich mein ja nur, Sam.
Ich hab zwar keine Ahnung von Ihrer Pinselei, aber ...
... Sie haben einen Toten gemalt.
<font color="green">Ich werde Ihnen</font>
<font color="green">meine "Pinselei" mal erklären.</font>
<font color="green">Schauen Sie das an.</font>
<font color="green">Das ist ein schlafender Mann,</font>
<font color="green">entspannt und ganz locker.</font>
<font color="green">Vollkommen dem Irdischen entrückt.</font>
<font color="green">Das Bild ist</font>
<font color="green">der Fantasie entsprungen.</font>
<font color="green">Jeder Künstler schnappt Impulse auf,</font>
<font color="green">schemenhafte Gestalten.</font>
<font color="green">Die dann durch seine Finger</font>
<font color="green">feste Formen annehmen.</font>
Verschonen Sie mich!
<font color="green">Ich brauche kein Modell.</font>
<font color="green">Ich hätte auch stattdessen</font>
<font color="green">etwas ganz anderes malen können.</font>
<font color="green">Mit den Bildern</font>
<font color="green">aus meinem Unterbewusstsein</font>
<font color="green">könnte ich eine Welt bevölkern.</font>
<font color="green">Die Variationen der menschlichen</font>
<font color="green">Mimik sind so vielseitig,</font>
<font color="green">dass sie immer wieder</font>
<font color="green">Überraschungen auslösen.</font>
<font color="green">Wir brauchen zum Beispiel ...</font>
<font color="green">... ein Augenlid, das sich hebt und</font>
<font color="green">etwas frische Farbe</font>
<font color="green">für die Wangen ...</font>
<font color="green">und einen kraftvollen,</font>
<font color="green">ausdrucksstarken Mund.</font>
<font color="green">So.</font>
Sam, was haben Sie getan?
<font color="green">Na, was schon?</font>
<font color="green">Ich führte Ihnen</font>
<font color="green">die Zeichenkunst vor.</font>
Sie haben ein Beweisstück zerstört.
<font color="green">Sie haben mich offenbar</font>
<font color="green">immer noch nicht verstanden.</font>
Ich hab das Gefühl,
Sie wollen mich auf den Arm nehmen.
Hier stimmt etwas nicht.
So schnell gebe ich nicht auf.
<font color="yellow">Gute Nacht.</font>
* Unheilvolle Klänge *
(Arnie) Hey! Was macht der in unserer Badewanne?
<font color="green">Na, da gehören Frösche hin.</font>
(Arnie) Ach so.
<font color="yellow">Arnie, geh zurück ins Bett.</font>
Ich schicke die Polizei zu Ihnen.
Die wollen sicher mit Ihnen reden.
Hoffentlich fällt Ihnen was ein.
<font color="yellow">Na, verschwinde!</font>
<font color="green">Ich bin dann in meinem Atelier.</font>
Gut. Halten Sie sich zur Verfügung.
* Geheimnisvolle Musik *
Wo ist er?
<font color="yellow">Er ist im Badezimmer und</font>
<font color="yellow">spielt mit seinem Frosch.</font>
Oh.
<font color="green">Kommen Sie hier entlang, Doktor.</font>
Ja.
<font color="yellow">Wegen Arnie.</font>
<font color="yellow">Er fühlt sich nicht gut.</font>
* Hupen *
Da spielt doch jemand an meiner Hupe!
Gehen Sie von meiner Hupe weg!
Das ist doch nicht Ihr Auto!
<font color="cyan">Was haben Sie denn?</font>
<font color="cyan">Miss Gravely und ich</font>
<font color="cyan">wollen einen Wagen kaufen.</font>
<font color="cyan">Ihr Wagen ist ja ein Prachtstück!</font>
Und das soll er auch bleiben. <font color="cyan">- So</font>
<font color="cyan">spricht man nicht mit einem Kunden.</font>
Sie werden nie mein Kunde.
Für Sie ist der Wagen zu teuer.
<font color="yellow">Er ist weg.</font>
<font color="green">Ich habe das kleine Ungeh...</font>
<font color="green">... ich hab Arnie ins Bett gebracht.</font>
<font color="yellow">Was sagte der Doktor?</font>
<font color="green">Der schickte mich raus.</font>
<font color="green">Irgendetwas gefiel ihm nicht.</font>
<font color="magenta">Na, Käpt'n? Haben Sie</font>
<font color="magenta">endlich Ihre Angst überwunden?</font>
<font color="cyan">Wieso Angst?</font>
<font color="cyan">Nein. Der schlug mich</font>
<font color="cyan">nicht in die Flucht.</font>
<font color="cyan">Mich konnte nicht mal</font>
<font color="cyan">der Klabautermann erschrecken.</font>
<font color="cyan">Nach all den abenteuerlichen Jahren,</font>
<font color="cyan">in denen ich</font>
<font color="cyan">quer durch die Welt segelte,</font>
<font color="cyan">geriet ich an viele unangenehmere</font>
<font color="cyan">Wesen. Ich sage euch ...</font>
<font color="cyan">Miss Gravely ...</font>
<font color="cyan">Was würden Sie sagen,</font>
<font color="cyan">wenn Sie erfahren würden ...</font>
<font color="cyan">... dass ich immer nur Käpt'n</font>
<font color="cyan">auf einem Schlepper war?</font>
<font color="cyan">Auf dem East River.</font>
<font color="cyan">Und dass ich nie mehr als</font>
<font color="cyan">eine Meile vom Ufer entfernt war.</font>
* Gefühlvolle Musik *
<font color="magenta">Ich würde sagen ...</font>
<font color="magenta">Sie sind</font>
<font color="magenta">der stattlichste Schlepperkapitän,</font>
<font color="magenta">der je auf dem East River fuhr.</font>
<font color="cyan">Oh, Miss Gravely. Nein ...</font>
<font color="cyan">Hier, soll ich euch mal was zeigen?</font>
<font color="cyan">Was sagt ihr dazu?</font>
<font color="yellow">Aber Käpt'n?</font>
<font color="green">Wo haben Sie die her?</font>
<font color="cyan">Aus Calvin Wiggs' Wagen.</font>
<font color="cyan">Wenn Sie sich um die eine Hälfte</font>
<font color="cyan">des Beweismaterials kümmern,</font>
<font color="cyan">muss ich mich um die andere kümmern.</font>
<font color="yellow">Sie sind ein toller Kapitän.</font>
Warum liegt der in der Badewanne?
<font color="green">Was haben Sie festgestellt?</font>
Nichts Besonderes.
Er erlitt einen Herzschlag.
<font color="yellow">Einen Herzschlag?</font>
Soweit ich es feststellen kann.
<font color="cyan">Also war die ganze Arbeit unnötig.</font>
<font color="cyan">Harry starb eines natürlichen Todes.</font>
Ja, sicher. Aber warum liegt er halb angezogen in der Badewanne?
<font color="yellow">Wir versteckten</font>
<font color="yellow">ihn vor Calvin Wiggs.</font>
<font color="yellow">Außerdem war er schmuddelig,</font>
<font color="yellow">nachdem wir ihn ausgruben.</font>
Sie gruben ihn aus?
<font color="yellow">Ich erkläre Ihnen alles.</font>
<font color="yellow">Harry wurde heute mehrmals</font>
<font color="yellow">ein- und ausgegraben.</font>
<font color="yellow">Schließlich wurde</font>
<font color="yellow">die Situation komplizierter.</font>
<font color="yellow">Wir wuschen ihn ab, denn man</font>
<font color="yellow">konnte ihn niemandem zeigen.</font>
Komplikationen?
<font color="yellow">Also, zum Beispiel ...</font>
<font color="yellow">Zuerst dachte Käpt'n Wiles,</font>
<font color="yellow">er hat Harry erschossen.</font>
<font color="yellow">Aber das Loch im Kopf war von</font>
<font color="yellow">Miss Gravelys Spazierstock,</font>
<font color="yellow">da er sie in die Büsche</font>
<font color="yellow">ziehen wollte.</font>
Käpt'n Wiles ist mit Miss Gravely in die Büsche? <font color="yellow">- Nein, Harry.</font>
<font color="yellow">Harry zerrte sie ins Gebüsch,</font>
<font color="yellow">weil er sie für mich hielt.</font>
<font color="yellow">Er war sicher durcheinander,</font>
<font color="yellow">weil ich ihn</font>
<font color="yellow">mit der Milchflasche schlug.</font>
<font color="yellow">Sam und der Käpt'n begruben</font>
<font color="yellow">Harry zum ersten Mal.</font>
<font color="yellow">Der Käpt'n hatte so große Angst.</font>
<font color="yellow">Aber dann nahm der Käpt'n</font>
<font color="yellow">das Kaninchen und</font>
<font color="yellow">schon war Harry wieder oben.</font>
<font color="yellow">Dann dachte Miss Gravely, ihr Wan-</font>
<font color="yellow">derstock wäre dafür verantwortlich.</font>
<font color="yellow">Weil der Käpt'n ihr</font>
<font color="yellow">einen Gefallen tun wollte,</font>
<font color="yellow">buddelte er ihn wieder ein.</font>
<font color="yellow">Dann kam Harry raus und</font>
<font color="yellow">wieder rein und ...</font>
<font color="yellow">Ich weiß auch nicht, warum.</font>
<font color="yellow">Er war wieder draußen,</font>
<font color="yellow">weil Sam und ich heiraten wollen.</font>
Wieso haben Sie ...?
<font color="yellow">... ihm den Schlag verpasst?</font>
<font color="yellow">Das hat persönliche Gründe,</font>
<font color="yellow">keine medizinischen.</font>
<font color="yellow">Ich habe einen Vorschlag:</font>
<font color="yellow">Sie erzählen keinem etwas davon,</font>
<font color="yellow">wir bringen Harry morgen</font>
<font color="yellow">frisch wieder zurück und</font>
<font color="yellow">keiner weiß, was los war.</font>
<font color="yellow">Dann haben wir mit der Geschichte</font>
<font color="yellow">nichts mehr zu tun.</font>
Bringen Sie ihn zurück!
Bringen Sie ihn zurück, damit dieser Albtraum aufhört!
* Geheimnisvolle Musik *
<font color="yellow">Er war so eigenartig, nicht wahr?</font>
* Jennifer lacht. *
<font color="magenta">Wollen wir Harry nicht lieber</font>
<font color="magenta">wieder anziehen?</font> <font color="green">- Ja, natürlich.</font>
* Aufgeweckte Musik *
<font color="yellow">Wäre es nicht das Einfachste,</font>
<font color="yellow">wenn Arnie ihn noch mal findet?</font>
<font color="yellow">Dann würde er nach Hause laufen,</font>
<font color="yellow">es mir sagen und ich rufe Wiggs an.</font>
<font color="green">Arnie könnte es Calvin</font>
<font color="green">am besten erklären.</font>
<font color="yellow">Dass er Harry fand, morgen.</font>
<font color="green">Du meinst heute?</font>
<font color="yellow">Aber für Arnie ist morgen gestern.</font>
<font color="green">Holen wir Harry. Kommen Sie, Käpt'n!</font>
* Bedrohliche Musik *
<font color="green">Er kommt.</font>
* Spannungsvolle Musik *
<font color="yellow">Los, Arnie, lauf nach Hause und</font>
<font color="yellow">erzähl mir alles.</font>
<font color="cyan">Aber nicht anfassen!</font> <font color="magenta">- Lauf nach</font>
<font color="magenta">Hause und erzähl es deiner Mutter!</font>
<font color="green">Verzieh dich, du kleiner Lümmel!</font>
<font color="green">Ich meine ...</font>
<font color="green">Lauf nach Hause, mein Sohn!</font>
* Gefahrvolle Musik *
<font color="magenta">Käpt'n, ich weiß Ihren Vornamen</font>
<font color="magenta">immer noch nicht.</font>
<font color="cyan">Albert. Und Ihrer?</font>
<font color="magenta">Ivy.</font>
<font color="cyan">Oh.</font>
<font color="magenta">Also Albert, gehen wir.</font>
<font color="cyan">Moment noch.</font>
<font color="cyan">Sam, was wünschten Sie sich</font>
<font color="cyan">eigentlich von dem Millionär?</font>
* Jennifer lacht. *
* Sam flüstert. *
* Käpt'n Wiles lacht. *
<font color="magenta">Albert, was war es?</font>
<font color="cyan">Ein Doppelbett.</font>
* Bedrohliche Musik *
DER ÄRGER MIT HARRY IST ZU ENDE.

Get back there, please.
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning, Sergeant.
- Good morning, Superintendent.
- Morning.
- Inspector Learoyd's here.
- Thank you.
- Who is she, Phil?
- Hello, Bob. No idea.
Bloodstained handkerchief in her pocket. Letter "S" in the corner.
You won't like this,
Hazard. She's very young.
Half a dozen knife wounds around the heart.
She died instantly.
- What sort of knife?
- Any sort, as long as it was sharp, pointed.
No sign.
- Who found her?
- Couple of kids.
No blood on the ground or any signs of a struggle.
Must have been killed somewhere else and dumped here.
How long has she been dead?
Between 5:00 and 8:00 yesterday evening is the nearest I can put it.
- Missing Persons have nothing to report, sir.
- Oh, thank you.
Ground's pretty hard.
We've searched the area, sir, but found nothing.
- Nothing but the handkerchief, huh?
- No, nothing.
Well, send her clothes along to the station, will you?
- Yes, sir.
- Come on, Phil.
Nice, simple things.
Are they?
- Don't quite go together, do they?
- These do.
Could be some hysterical, frightened boy.
I don't think so.
In my experience, an hysterical, frightened boy stabs once, oh, twice maybe... and then runs.
But this monkey went on and on until he was exhausted.
No, this girl was killed in hate, not fear.
I should say she was a student.
Now, if she was in the habit of going away for the weekend... she may not be missed until tomorrow.
Get a list of every college and academy in London.
See if a girl doesn't turn up in the morning.
Particularly any girl whose name begins with "S."
- Ratsy.
- David.
Where's Sapphire?
Isn't she in Birmingham with her brother?
I don't know. She was going, and then she changed her mind.
I don't know what she did.
Well, if you're worried, why don't you phone him?
No, I don't want to speak to her brother.
Oh, she caught the morning train, I expect.
Don't worry. Sapphire will be in Foscari's for coffee.
See you then.
- Hi, David.
- Hi.
Congratulations on your scholarship.
- When are you off to Rome?
- Next month.
Lucky devil.
David! David.
David.
Mr. Harris. We won't keep you very long.
I
- I'm sorry, but we think you may be able to help us.
Thank you, miss.
Hey. What's the matter with you? Come on.
- Patsy!
- What is it?
That murdered girl on Hampstead Heath?
- It's Sapphire.
- What?
Hey, Anna, coffee. Quick.
Sapphire. How ghastly.
The police kept asking me questions about her- who her friends were.
- I said us.
- Well, of course.
- We were all her friends.
- What else did they ask you?
All about David
- the scholarship and everything.
If she'd had any boyfriends before him. Oh, I couldn't tell them.
I've only known her since I took her to stay with me at my digs.
- Where was she living before that?
- A dump in Earls Court.
- The landlady turned her out.
- But why? Sapphire was such a sweetie.
Who'd do such a thing to Sapphire? Who'd do it?
You say her name was Sapphire Robbins?
I'd like you to come down to my office, ask a few questions.
Do you think you feel up to it?
We'll send you home in a police car afterwards.
We were going to get married.
I'm sorry.
You say the last time you saw her was on Friday night?
Yes.
Do you know what she did on Saturday?
Well, she came to my house, apparently, just after lunch.
You weren't in?
No, I went to Cambridge to sketch.
I
- I'm a student architect at the Polytechnic.
What train did you catch?
I hitchhiked both ways.
- What time did you get home?
- About 11:00.
Who gave you a lift from Cambridge?
A chap in a black Consul dropped me at the post office.
- What time was that?
- About quarter to 11:00.
You wouldn't remember the number of the car, I suppose.
No.
Somebody ought to tell Sapphire's brother.
We contacted Dr. Robbins in Birmingham.
He's on his way to London now.
Oh.
Did you and Sapphire have a quarrel on Friday night?
- No.
- Thank you.
Sergeant, drive Mr. Harris home, will you?
Very good, sir.
You'll let me know if you find out anything, won't you?
You'll be informed, Mr. Harris.
Oh, Mr. Harris. What time did you say you got back from Cambridge?
- About 11:00.
- Thank you.
The truth, do you think?
Well, not what I'd describe as the whole truth.
I don't believe he came in when he said he did... but his grief seemed genuine enough.
You never know with these monkeys. They can act their heads off when it suits them.
Ring up the Yard and get them to ask the BBC to broadcast for the driver of that black Consul.
Right.
Meanwhile, we'll take a look at that girl's room before her brother gets here.
- Had she been with you long?
- About six months.
Hmm. Not very tidy.
Sapphire wasn't naturally an orderly child, but she did her best.
- Did you like her?
- Indeed I did.
I
- I felt sorry for her.
Her parents were dead, and she wanted so much to - to be counted in, to belong.
Did you ever meet her brother?
No, but I spoke to him on the telephone. He sounded very nice.
- This one's locked.
- I'm sorry. I haven't the key.
Oh, I wish you wouldn't.
I never saw Sapphire wear anything like that.
Hmm.
I wonder who she was dancing with.
- Did she play the gramophone often? - All the time -very softly.
She was a student at the
Royal Academy of Music.
Hmm.
Well, thank you, Mrs. Thompson.
You've been most helpful.
Well, evidently there was a side to Sapphire she didn't know about.
Yeah.
Maybe young Harris found the same thing and didn't like it.
Could be.
Unless the person she was dancing with found out about young Harris.
Jealousy's very near to hate.
Oh, Mrs. Farr. Mrs.
Farr, your brother's here.
David? What's the matter?
Milly, I've got to speak to you.
The girl's brother's here, sir. Dr. Robbins.
- Right. Send him in.
- Sir.
Dr. Robbins, sir.
- It's very good of you to come so quickly, sir.
- How do you do?
- Please sit down.
- Thank you.
I suppose there's no doubt.
It is Sapphire?
No doubt at all, I'm afraid.
I know this must be painful for you... but there are some questions I have to ask you.
Of course. No, thank you.
I understand you expected your sister for the weekend.
Yes, I did.
Weren't you worried when she didn't turn up on Saturday?
No, no. She rang me, said something unexpected had stopped her.
With Sapphire, something unexpected was always happening.
- How did she sound?
- Excited, I thought.
What sort of a girl was your sister?
Happy, lively
- exactly as she looked.
No, no. That's not quite true, is it?
Are you - Were you
Sapphire's half-brother?
No.
Our father was a doctor-white... our mother a singer
- black as I am.
You never know which way it's gonna go.
Since Sapphire came to London, she learned to pass for white.
Did David Harris know that your sister was colored?
I don't know.
I knew little of Sapphire's life up here.
She seemed happy. I didn't pry further.
My sister was 21, you know.
Why did you let her come to London?
She wanted to come.
I didn't see why she shouldn't have the same chance as any other youngster.
I'm a bachelor. I could afford to stake her.
Did she every talk about anyone else besides young Harris?
I can't remember.
I hardly listened,
Sapphire chattered so much.
It's unbelievable.
I can see her now... sitting on the table in my consulting room... swinging her legs, laughing... twittering like a bird.
Patients waiting, but on she went.
I could have slapped her sometimes.
Who would do such a thing?
Who would do it?
- I'd like to see my sister.
- I'll take you.
No, I'd rather go alone.
- The New End Hospital, Hampstead.
- Thank you.
- Bob, that girl who - -
Oh, this is Dr. Robbins.
Detective Inspector Learoyd.
How do you do?
Hello.
You can get me at the Dorset
Hotel. They take us there.
Thank you.
So, that's the brother.
Yes.
I think I was right.
Hate killed Sapphire.
I think she died because she was colored.
She was also pregnant.
Three months. The autopsy's just in.
Young Harris, of course.
Oh, I don't know. We can't be sure now, can we?
I mean, uh, might be anybody.
Dad, I've been trailing everywhere after you.
What's the matter?
The girl on Hampstead Heath
- it was Sapphire.
- Sapphire?
- Yes, David's had to go and identify her.
David?
- I'm so frightened, Dad.
- Don't worry, girl. Where's David now?
He's gone home.
You didn't tell us you were the father of Sapphire's child.
You didn't ask me.
Were you on the other side of that?
No.
It's the police, Ted. They're in there with Davy now.
Don't worry, dear. It's only routine.
- Where do you think you're going to?
- Up to my room, Dad.
I told him he could, and I want him to.
Show him, Milly?
- I'm Davy's father.
- Uh, Superintendent Hazard.
- What's been said?
- They know about the baby, Dad.
Well, what of it? We knew.
She came here to tell us on
Saturday, just after lunch.
My boy was going to marry her.
I gave her my word he would.
They want to know what time I got in on Saturday night, Dad.
About 11:00.
Did you talk to anyone in Cambridge, anyone who might remember you?
- Where did you eat?
- I took sandwiches.
He always does. We can't afford meals in cafés, you know.
Finished, Inspector?
Yes. Uh, thank you, Mrs. Farr.
He went through David's room with a magnifying glass.
I don't care if they take the boards up. Davy's got nothing to hide.
Do you think they'll be gone by the time the twins get back?
They'll hear it at school, Milly.
You can't keep it from them.
You've got to make up your mind to that.
Excuse me. Superintendent Hazard would like to see you for a moment, Mrs. Farr.
Uh, Mrs. Farr, what time did you finish work at the dairy on Saturday?
- About half 6:00.
- A little late, surely.
My assistant was away all last week. I had the tidying up to do.
I see. Did you come straight home?
- This is your home?
- For the moment.
My husband's away at sea.
- Who was in the house when you got here?
- Nobody.
I was at the club. My wife was at her sister's with the twins.
- Twins?
- My children.
Oh. Uh, the girl, Sapphire, had gone when you got in?
Yes. She wasn't here.
How did she seem when you saw her earlier in the day?
Same as usual
- full of life.
Did you know that she was colored?
- We knew.
- How long?
We knew. That's enough, isn't it?
I see.
I understand you've just won a scholarship that takes you abroad.
Of course, you won't leave till all this is settled, will you?
- Don't worry. He'll be staying here.
- All right, Dad. I can answer for myself.
Is that all, Superintendent?
There are the children. I must get their tea.
Why, of course, Mrs. Farr.
Superintendent?
Hadn't you better advertise for the fellow that drove Davy back from Cambridge?
I don't want any slime sticking to my son, you know.
We have that in hand, Mr. Harris.
You say this man dropped you at the post office.
Did anyone see you at that time of night on Saturday?
I don't know.
Yes. Yes, Jack Ferris.
He saw me, Dad.
The local constable. You wouldn't call him a liar, I suppose.
LfJohnny Turnbull trod on your feet, he didn't mean to.
- Little boys are clumsy dancers.
- It wasn't your feet he trod on.
Oh, Mummy, he's always stumbling.
I hate dancing classes.
Last week, you loved them.
Hello. Good day, Mrs. Farr.
Good day.
Thank you.
- There's angel cake for tea.
- Ooh, good!
- They knew she was colored then.
- Yes. But the point is when.
And that's a very important point.
- Find anything upstairs?
- No, nothing.
- All his clothes were clean and put away.
- Hmm.
Pretty rocky alibi of young Harris's.
- Familiar motive too.
- It's all too pat for my liking.
You know, if he'd married that girl, he probably couldn't have taken up that scholarship.
- It wouldn't carry a grant for a wife.
- Hmm.
Are we gonna have a word with this local constable -What's his name, Ferris?
Yes, right away.
Yes, sir. I did see young Harris walking home on Saturday night.
- What time was that?
- Oh, as near 11:00 as makes no difference.
- And he was coming from the post office?
- From that direction, sir.
- What sort of people are the Harrises?
- Oh, very respectable, sir.
Cut above the average.
Mrs. Harris was a schoolteacher.
How long have they known the girl was colored?
- What?
- Yes, she was, you know.
Ooh, I shouldn't have thought they knew that at all, sir.
- He's very bigoted, Ted Harris.
- And very ambitious for his son.
Oh, very.
Ted Harris has scrimped himself to do for Davy.
Mind you, the boy's repaid it all with that scholarship he's won.
- And the daughter?
- Oh, Milly's her father all over again.
Dancing classes for the twins. Elocution.
Must have that bit extra.
- Her husband's a sailor?
- Merchant navy.
Bit of a laddo, Sid Farr.
Doesn't seem to get much leave, or doesn't want it.
Can you find out if Harris used his van on Saturday night?
I'll do my best, sir.
He only saw him coming from the direction of the post office.
That's no alibi, you know.
Well, the boy looks truthful to me.
What's the track width of
Harris's van, would you say?
Oh, I don't know.
Four foot, 4 foot 6.
Hmm. I think I'll go back to the Heath and take a look around.
- Four foot 6 inches, sir.
- Yes.
Yes, it's more than possible.
Sir.
You shouldn't have come.
I wanted to see where my sister died.
Not here.
- No?
- No.
She was brought here somehow and... left.
- There is no roadway for a car.
- Oh, I don't know.
A small one could have just made it, but the ground's too hard to show tracks.
- Did David Harris kill her?
- What makes you say that?
She was pregnant.
- I've seen the autopsy.
- Yes, but that's no proof that he killed her.
If he did, we'll get him, rest assured.
There is no assurance for me or my kind, Superintendent.
I've been black for 38 years.
I know.
She may have looked white, but Sapphire was colored.
Your sister was murdered.
We'll find out who killed her.
- I'm sure that is your intention.
- It is my intention.
It's also my job.
I'm sorry.
Thank you.
When I was a child... another boy touched me.
He then held out his hand.
"Look," he said...
"nothing's come off on me. "
Trouble is, something came off on me.
- How do I get to Bloomsbury?
- I'll give you a lift. It's on my way.
- Oh!
- Sorry, sir.
I'm full.
I don't want a room. I've come to thank you for looking after my sister.
You've got the wrong address.
I take only white students.
My name is Robbins.
How much did Sapphire owe you?
Her rent was paid up.
May I come tomorrow and pick up Sapphire's things?
The police have sealed her room. You must ask them.
Patsy.
Patsy! You in, Patsy?
What is it, Mrs. Thompson?
That girl you brought here
- Did you know she was colored?
- What girl?
- Sapphire.
Yes. Yes, I did.
- When did she tell you?
- Well, she didn't. A friend told me.
This house is my living.
If it got round that I took colored students... certain white people wouldn't allow their children to stay here.
- Well, I think it's a damn silly prejudice!
- I'm not saying it isn't.
But I can't afford to have my rooms empty.
- To think that she could be so sly.
- It's people like you who made her sly.
Well, you've jolly well got another room empty now!
Patsy!
Yes?
You took Sapphire home to Guildford, didn't you?
Yes.
Did you tell your father and mother she was colored?
No.
Well, then don't be so quick to call me prejudiced.
Are you sure? Right.
Well, Harris's van could have made it.
- Not on Saturday night, it couldn't.
- What?
The van was in the garage having a big end fixed.
Harris didn't pick it up until Monday morning.
Well, how the blazes did he get her there?
Ask Sergeant Cook to come in, will you?
Thank you.
Red taffeta under a tweed skirt.
Yes. That's the black under the white, all right.
Oh, come off it, Phil.
Yes?
Oh, come in, Sergeant Cook.
Tell me... what do you make of that?
- I wouldn't know what to make of it, sir.
- Oh, come. You're a woman.
Now, where do you suppose a thing like that could be bought?
- I wouldn't know, sir.
- No.
Try Babette's, Shaftesbury Avenue.
- And how would you know?
- You just take my word for it.
They cater for girls who like flashy, pretty underwear.
- It certainly isn't built for durability.
- No.
Well, check on it first thing in the morning, will you?
- Babette's, you say?
- Shaftesbury Avenue.
Shaftesbury Avenue. There's a good girl.
And I bet you her boyfriend bought it for her.
- Going in today, Davy?
- Course he is.
I'm not going in.
You've got to face it sometime, lad. Better now than later.
It's in the paper this morning. The autopsy-
- They don't mention David.
- Won't stop them guessing.
Oh, Davy, whatever made you get mixed up with a colored girl?
I didn't know.
- When did you know?
- Last week.
- By then, I didn't care.
- That's what she banked on.
Never say you didn't know till last week. Never!
What's it matter?
It gives you a motive.
That's what it matters.
It gives us all a motive.
We none of us knew till the weekend, did we?
No.
I'll never forget her standing here Saturday.
And when Dad said he'd see her brother and tell him that Davy would stand by her... she laughed and said...
"He'll be a shock to you.
He's as black as a pot. "
- Shut up!
- Milly.
Then she laughed some more and said, "Don't look like that.
David doesn't care. "
Have you done your teeth?
- Hands well scrubbed?
- Smell.
Mmm. Lovely smell.
Oh, Janice, I've got something for you.
- Here you are. Now you've both got one.
- Oh, thank you, Granddad.
Granddad, will you make me another one? I can't find mine.
Well, you better look for it.
Buck up with your breakfast, you two, and
Grampy will take you to school in the van.
Don't bother, Dad. I'll take them to school.
Yes, I remember the girl.
She used to spend quite a bit of money here.
She was a good customer for a little while.
- When?
- About six, seven months ago.
- Did she come alone?
- Usually.
- Oh.
- Except once.
- Well?
- She had a young fellow with her then.
- Tall, slim boy, fair?
- No, I remember being very surprised.
She was such a dainty kid... and he was a great big colored chap.
Colored.
"A great big colored chap," she said.
Hmm. The other side of the picture.
Before she learnt she could pass for white.
Really? It's a doctor in Bloomsbury.
Says Sapphire went to see him on Saturday morning.
- Tell him we'll be right over.
- Right.
Sergeant, ring up the
Royal College of Music... and see if they have any record of Sapphire's previous addresses.
Very good, sir.
Oh, and then you could nip over to the Harrises' place... and see if any of the neighbors saw the girl leave on Saturday.
No, she wasn't a regular patient.
I'd never seen her before.
She rang for an immediate appointment.
I saw her at 12:30 on Saturday.
- Did you tell her at once?
- Yes, she was bursting to know.
- Was she upset?
- No, on the contrary, excited.
Delighted at having her own suspicions confirmed.
- What name did she use?
- The one on the card.
Mrs. Harris.
Did she tell you she was colored?
No, she didn't mention it.
No, I'll bet she didn't. But you can always tell, can't you?
No, Inspector. As a matter of fact, you can't.
What? Well, I can tell them a mile away.
Oh, I don't know, Inspector.
- Would you say you were a policeman?
- What?
Well, you haven't got very big feet, have you?
Don't they say you can always tell a policeman a mile off by the size of his feet?
Oh, that's bloody silly.
Yes, isn't it?
Well, I'm afraid there's nothing we can do about Learoyd's feet.
But regarding the girl, was there anything else about her that struck you?
Yes. I thought she was a rather nice person.
- Well, thank you, Doctor.
- Not at all.
You've been most helpful.
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.
Good-bye.
She must have been pretty sure about young Harris.
At any rate, she thought he'd take the doctor's news happily enough.
- Perhaps she summed the boy up wrongly.
- Mmm.
- Any of the girl's addresses come through?
- Yes, sir.
A house in Bloomsbury. Before that, a place in Earls Court.
And another lead
- Chelsea Women's Hospital.
- We'll try Earls Court first.
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, I remember Sapphire Robbins.
- What sort of a girl was she?
Nice enough girl, considering she was colored.
- Oh, you knew then?
- I guessed. You can always tell.
Too eager to please, laughed too much, noisy with her gramophone.
But I never mind so long as they don't look it.
Still, I had to get rid of her in the end.
Why?
Couldn't risk upsetting the other tenants.
Some big colored bloke started calling for her.
Black as your hat, he was. I run a white house.
You never can tell when the others are going to kick.
- What was this fellow's name?
- I don't know.
Did she get any phone calls?
One or two, from the
International Club and her brother.
Were you surprised when
Sapphire got herself killed?
All depends upon how much hate she stirred up.
Hate?
- I dare say she was passing for white.
- So?
Would you be pleased with a brass sovereign, Superintendent?
- Is that all?
- Yes. Thank you very much.
These landladies. They know it all, don't they?
Oh, I wouldn't say that.
After all, they've got a living to earn, I suppose.
- Chelsea Women's Hospital, isn't it?
- Yeah.
Miss Mary Dawson.
- Miss Dawson?
- Yes.
Well, my name is Hazard.
This is Inspector Learoyd.
- You want to talk to me about Sapphire?
- Yes.
I saw it in the paper. It upset me very much.
- Did you like Sapphire?
- Yes, I did.
- Tell me, was she fond of dancing?
- Mad about it.
And who were her dancing partners?
Ray Landa, Paul Slade.
Uh-huh. How can we get in touch with these people?
Ray Landa went home to
Nigeria six months ago... but I can give you Paul
Slade's telephone number.
- What is that?
- Chancery 2496.
- Thank you.
- Paul Slade was a law student then.
Now he's a barrister.
Well, thank you, Miss Dawson.
You've been most helpful.
Oh, tell me -
Why did you stop seeing Sapphire?
She stopped seeing me. I'm rather distinctive, you know.
Hello, Ted.
He's down there.
He's been back and forth along that footpath all afternoon.
- What's he looking for?
- Search me.
But whatever it is, he hasn't found it.
See you.
None of the neighbors saw Sapphire leave Harris's house on Saturday, sir.
Yes?
- Mr. Paul Slade, sir.
- Oh, bring him in.
- The dancing lawyer.
- I beg your pardon, sir?
What? Oh, it doesn't matter.
This way, sir.
Oh, it's very good of you to come all this way, Mr. Slade.
- Not at all.
- Thank you, Sergeant.
I'd rather call on you than have you call on me.
My father's in London for a conference at Lambeth Palace.
I don't think there's a bishop living who'd appreciate his son... being mixed up in a murder inquiry... however indirectly.
Here, won't you sit down?
Here, let me take that.
I understand you knew Sapphire Robbins.
Very well.
- May I?
- Please do.
Oh, thank you.
Where did you first meet her?
At the International Club - one of those get-together, let's-be-brothers places.
How long since you last saw her?
Seven, eight months.
Has she any other friends besides yourself?
Chap called Ray Landa.
He's gone home, I believe.
Anyone else?
Not that I know of.
You sent for me to ask where I was on Saturday.
I was meeting my father off a boat at Southampton.
We stayed the night... and I drove him back to town on Sunday morning.
Thank you.
Did you ever have a photograph taken with Sapphire?
Yes.
In a group.
Did you ever have one taken alone, dancing at a nightclub?
Never alone, Superintendent.
Did you ever take her shopping in Shaftesbury Avenue?
- Babette's, for instance.
- Good Lord, no. Why?
Well, if you didn't, it doesn't matter.
What sort of a girl was Sapphire?
Oh, neither one thing nor tother when I knew her.
I imagine she changed after she got this yen to marry light.
If you know what I mean.
I do. That ruled you out anyway.
The question of marriage between Sapphire and myself could never have arisen.
- How's that?
- My father would never have permitted it.
Well, why not? Sapphire came from a good home.
Her brother's a doctor.
She was part white.
- Is that all?
- Well, for the moment, yes.
If we need you, we'll send for you.
- Any help I can give.
- Thank you.
Hmm.
- Did he ask aboutJohnny?
- No.
Good.
If my old man knew I'd been around places like Tulip's... he'd cut off my allowance and yank me back home.
- Is this policeman likely to get onto it?
- Shouldn't think so.
Didn't strike me as being overburdened with brains.
Sanctimonious -
Always so careful to have his hand out first.
I know.
We're all the children of God. Forget it.
I see you've been talking to Slade.
I suppose he's got a cast-iron alibi.
- Yes.
- Yeah.
But there's something he didn't want me to know.
- What's that?
- I don't know.
He said he met Sapphire at the International Club.
Get onto them, find out what time all the kids are likely to be there together.
Okay.
Yes? What is it, Sergeant?
- It's about young Harris, sir.
- What about him?
He's up on the heath. He's been there all the afternoon looking for something.
He pushed it down the drain, sir.
It was quite deliberate, so I thought I'd best find out what it was.
Well, it's a piece of wood.
Must have been painted at some time.
Look, you can see the red and blue marks.
Yeah.
Been jointed at both ends.
Must have come off something.
Off what, I wonder.
- Take this to the lab and see what they make of it.
- Very good, sir.
Now, why on earth should that boy be so anxious to find that and then get rid of it?
You didn't go in today.
Davy, this is a terrible thing that's happened, but you've got to pull yourself together.
In three weeks, you'll be going away.
Rome. It's a new world.
New people, new places.
You'll forget.
I shan't.
I can't.
Davy, you did speak the truth about Saturday?
You didn't meet Sapphire, did you?
Davy... what happened on Saturday night?
Mum, never ask what happened on Saturday.
Never.
Davy.
You didn't meet Sapphire on Saturday, did you?
Answer me, Davy. Did you?
- Granny!
- There are the twins.
- Answer me, Davy.
- Granny! Granny!
- Gran!
- All right, kids. Granny's here.
- Granny! Granny!
- Granny! Granny!
What's the matter? I thought you'd gone to tea with Molly Turnbull.
- Her mother didn't want us.
- Why?
She said we were a funny family and she didn't want us.
What's happened?
What is it, Mother?
Go and take your hats and coats off, hmm?
What is it?
Mrs. Turnbull wouldn't have the twins for tea.
I think they ought to go and stay with Katie in Richmond.
Oh, I don't know what Sid would say.
Stop pretending about Sid.
He doesn't care whether they're here or in Timbuktu.
He's a bad husband and a bad father.
All right, Mum. I'll get Dad to drive them down tomorrow.
Ring Katie now.
All right.
Mildred.
What time did you leave Sapphire on Saturday?
Half 1:00, Mum.
Then I went back to the shop, left her here with Dad.
- Then only Dad was at home.
- That's right.
- Davy wasn't.
- No, he didn't get in till 11:00.
- Did you see him?
- No, I was in bed, but Dad was up.
Then we've only got Dad's word that he came in when he said he did.
Mum.
What are you thinking?
Nothing.
I'll ring Katie. You see to the children's tea.
Oh, dear. We'll never live it down.
- Who says?
- Molly Turnbull's mother.
What won't we live down?
I don't know, but it's something to do with Auntie Sapphire.
She's dead.
Time to settle down now, children.
Mummy, why are we going to stay with Auntie Katie?
Ask no questions, and you'll be told no lies.
It's because of Auntie Sapphire, isn't it?
No. And don't call her "Auntie. "
She's nothing to us, and she never was.
- Good night, my darling.
- Good night, Mummy.
Good night, my love.
Good night, Mummy.
Straight off to sleep. No talking.
- Yes, Mummy.
- Good night.
I've told you a dozen times if I've told you once...
so why go on arguing about it?
David came in at 11:00.
That's what I told the police, and it's the truth.
It's what you told the police,
Ted, but is it the truth?
Stop accusing David. Please, Mum.
Milly, if we're to help him, we've got to know the truth.
Lies are never any good.
Who says Davy's telling lies?
I don't want any supper, Mum. I'm going out.
- Where are you going, Son?
- I'm going for a walk, Mum.
Don't be too late, will you?
I don't think you'll find who you're looking for here, Superintendent.
We haven't seen Sapphire for six, seven months.
We're merely trying to fill in her background, Mr. Young.
- As you wish. This way.
- Thank you.
I'll get some quiet.
Quiet, everybody, please.
Quiet, please, everybody.
And just gather around me, will you?
Won't keep you a moment, but these gentlemen are police officers.
They want to ask you a few questions about Sapphire Robbins.
Sapphire Robbins?
Was anyone here a particular friend of Sapphire's?
- We all were, weren't we?
- Once.
What do you mean "once"?
I mean she stopped coming here.
Oh, why?
They drift away,
Superintendent, grow out of us.
Sapphire didn't drift away.
She used to come here regularly.
- Then suddenly, she never came again.
- Why was that?
Sapphire found she could pass for white. I was there the day it happened.
Tell me.
We had just finished coffee.
I went to pay the bill.
A white lady came in, took one look at my black mug and said...
"Oh, I see they've let the jungle in. "
She said this to Sapphire, you see, like they were the same.
Sapphire left before I got my change.
When I went outside, she had gone. Silly little peasant.
Did you ever dance with Sapphire?
No, not me.
Slade, Ray Landa
- They were her partners.
And Wishy Washy there.
- Where did you dance with her?
- Here, sir.
Did she mention anyone else?
Outside the club, I mean.
No. No.
If you do remember anything, speak to Mr. Young.
He'll know how to get in touch with us.
I think you're right. I don't think I shall find anything here.
Thank you so much, everybody.
It's been most kind of you.
I'll see you out.
Please don't bother.
You'll miss the performance.
Right.
He's a good pianist.
Yes, and he's lucky.
- He'll be accepted for what he is.
- And what's that?
A good pianist.
- There's a young lady in the car, sir.
- Ah, I thought as much.
Drive around the block.
Phil, get in the front.
Very good, sir.
Yes, I know a lot about
Sapphire they don't know.
Go on.
The rhythm at the club
- it wasn't hot enough for her.
So Paul Slade used to take her to Tulip's
- a dive in Shepherd's Bush.
- Oh, dear. His father, the bishop, huh?
- Yes. I know His Reverence.
He'd as soon see his precious son in hellfire as at Tulip's.
Paul got into a fight there over Sapphire.
Well, who did he fight with?
Oh, a Johnnie someone.
"Big, ugly fellow," he said.
Sapphire danced crazy with him. Real crazy.
- Paul dropped her after that.
- Poor Sapphire.
Oh, she couldn't care less. She'd gotJohnnie then.
Of course, he didn't last very long when his color went out of fashion.
How did you know that?
He rang up, left a message for her. "Ring Johnnie at Tulip's. "
Sapphire had gone white then, so we never saw her.
I told him. He was mad.
They'd entered for some dancing competition. Cash prize he said.
You didn't like Sapphire.
No. I was Paul Slade's girlfriend till she cut me out.
I hated that high-yellow doll.
You can drop me anywhere here. I'll walk back.
- What are you studying? -
Montessori - child welfare.
- I shan't bother with it though.
- Oh, why not?
I want to get married, stay here. I like the English.
- Well, thank you. - Bye-bye.
By the way, did you give this
Johnnie Sapphire's new address?
No, I wouldn't do that. Perhaps he got it from someone else though, huh?
- Mm-hmm. - Try Tulip's
Club, Shepherd's Bush.
- I will. Good night.
- Good night.
- Two beers.
- No beer, sir.
- Two beers.
- Scotch, Irish and bourbon, sir.
- Buy me a drink, copper.
- Three beers.
- Ever heard of Sapphire?
- Doubles, sir?
Three beers.
- The chick that was done on Hampstead Heath?
- That's the chick.
Ten shillings, sir.
Sorry I've got nothing smaller.
- Ten shillings, sir.
- Keep the change.
Now then, ever heard of Sapphire?
- Down the hatch, copper.
- Is Johnnie in tonight?
Johnnie
- is he in tonight?
- Talking to me, sir?
- Yes.
Lots ofJohnnie here tonight, sir. There's Johnnie Fingers.
Johnnie Hot Feet.
Johnnie Rags.
And Johnnie Tiger over there.
Sure, all theJohnnies in the world are here tonight, sir.
We want theJohnnie who danced with this chick.
This chick was never here at all, sir.
Can I help you, Superintendent?
- Mr. Tulip?
- That's what they call me.
We're looking for theJohnnie who used to dance with Sapphire - this Sapphire.
You mean the chick that was cut up on Hampstead Heath Saturday night?
- Mm-hmm. - She's new to me. I never saw her here.
That's a lily-skin.
Your chick was a lily-skin, wasn't she?
- Hmm?
- It's in the evening papers.
I think I would've remembered if she'd ever been in here.
Oh, you can always tell.
'Cause once they hear the beat of the bongo -
Yes.
No matter how fair is the skin, they can't hide that swing.
Your chick was never here, Superintendent.
Somewhere else she danced with herJohnnie.
Let's get out of here.
Blow, Johnnie. And don't come back.
You're wearing too much trouble.
Johnnie.
Where was you on Saturday night, Johnnie?
You wasn't in the club.
Was you with Sapphire?
Was you, Johnnie?
You blow, Johnnie. Blow.
Can't blow without loot.
I'll bring you loot.
That's him.
Brother, I'm in trouble.
The police. I've got to hide up.
We have never been in trouble with the law and don't care to be.
Go on away with you, boy. It's you and your kind that get us respectable folk a bad name.
Trash.
The police
- on my tail.
Get out, nigger.
We got copper trouble, too, but we ain't got your sort of woman trouble.
Now get out and stay out.
Dirty black bas -
Right. Up.
Here, look at that.
What's the hurry, nigger?
Out of the way, nig.
On your way then, sonny boy.
And hurry!
- They're after me. Please.
- Who's after you - the teds?
- Please help.
- I daren't.
They'd break the place to pieces, tear the shop down. It's my living, boy.
- Please, mister.
- I tell you I daren't.
Dad, you've got to. He's in trouble.
- I tell you I daren't.
- You've got to, Dad.
Come in. This way.
- Where were you on Saturday night, Johnnie?
- On the streets.
- With Sapphire?
- No, boss. No.
- Which street, Johnnie?
- Down the West End.
- Who was with you?
- No one. I was on my pat.
- Johnnie all alone, eh?
- The truth, Johnnie. Let's have the truth.
- Where were you Saturday night?
- Where were you Saturday night?
Answer!
Davy? Where have you been?
Walking.
Davy.
Where were you on Saturday night?
In a car on my way back from Cambridge.
- Where were you on Saturday night?
- I told you.
Davy.
Ever since you were a little boy,
I've known when you were lying to me.
Where were you, Sonny?
Mum, I told you never to ask about Saturday night. Please.
Saturday night, Johnnie. Where were you?
Out! Out!
- Where?
- On the streets.
- Who with?
- On my pat.
- Who with?
- On my pat.
- When'd you see Sapphire last?
- I don't know Sapphire!
You phoned the International
Club and left a message for her.
Now, where were you Saturday night?
Out! Out!
Someone's gonna look at you in the morning... someone who saw you with Sapphire.
Want to change your story, Johnnie?
No! No!
- Right. Book him.
- Come on. On your feet.
Why do you say you didn't know Sapphire?
You had a fight over her at Tulip's.
Didn't kill her.
All right. Knew Sapphire, but didn't kill her.
- You were crazy about her, weren't you?
- No. We just dance, laugh.
She went white and dropped you, didn't she?
Then you ran into her on Saturday night, followed her and knifed her.
No! We used to dance. That's all, just dance!
Where is your knife, Johnnie?
Your knife, Johnnie -where is it?
Where's your knife?
All right. Take him away.
Find the knife and we've got him.
- Yes?
- Johnnie Fiddle.
Out.
Upstairs, far as you can go. Left.
Thank you.
There you are, the two of them.
- In congress, aren't they?
- No, I wouldn't say that.
She wasn't any delicate flower, you know.
Just the same as him underneath.
Besides, he didn't look so black to her then.
No.
Let's take a look around.
Huh. Look at this.
And this.
Looks like young Harris is in the clear.
Yeah, looks that way.
Let's see what the lab has to say about it.
- It's quite a long trip.
- What?
From here to Hampstead Heath.
It's the other side of London.
How the devil did he get there?
Oh, there will be a simple answer to transport.
You'd really like it to be this colored boy, wouldn't you?
Message over the car radio, sir.
There's a gentleman at the station says he drove
Mr. David Harris from Cambridge last Saturday.
Hey.
There's your transport for you.
These spades are a load of trouble.
I reckon we should send them back where they came from.
We wouldn't have half this bother if they weren't here.
Oh, I suppose you're right.
Just the same as you wouldn't have old ladies being clobbered by hooligans... if there weren't any old ladies.
So, what do you do
- get rid of the hooligans or the people they bash?
Look, RhiI, given the right atmosphere, you can organize riots against anyone-
Jews, Catholics, Negroes, Irish... even policemen with big feet.
Is this the boy you gave a lift to just outside Cambridge on Saturday?
- Yes.
- What time did you put him down?
I dropped him at the post office, oh, around 6:00.
He said it was only a 10 minutes' walk away from where he lived.
Are you sure?
I wouldn't be here if I wasn't.
- Do you deny this?
- What's the use?
Well, thank you, sir.
I hope we haven't wasted too much of your time.
Oh, it's quite all right.
Sorry, old chap.
Well, sit down, Mr. Harris.
What time did you get home on Saturday?
- You heard what the man said.
I got back to town at 6:00.
I didn't get home till 11:00.
Then what did you do in between?
Walked about. Then I went to the pictures.
Well, why didn't you say this before?
I didn't want my father to know.
He worries if I go to the pictures too often in term time. Thinks it strains my eyes.
Give me your glasses.
- Which cinema did you go to?
- The Ritz.
What were you doing on
Hampstead Heath yesterday?
- If I told you, you wouldn't believe me.
- Well, just try, will you?
I
- I wanted to see where it happened.
I had some idea I might stumble on something - something I'd recognize and you wouldn't.
And did you?
No.
How about this?
Why were you so anxious to get rid of this?
I didn't.
L- I -
I
- I never saw it before.
I'm told it's part of a child's doll, a wooden doll.
A leg possibly.
- Is that what you think it is?
- Oh, I don't think it's anything.
Ju-Just a piece of wood I was doodling with.
- You admit picking it up then.
- Yes.
- You just said you didn't. - I - I'd forgotten.
Stop lying, Harris. You were seen pushing this down a drain.
- Why?
- I don't know. I don't know.
You mean you won't say. On your way home from the post office on Saturday night...
- was it then you met Sapphire?
- No. I never saw her.
- Was it then she told you about the baby?
- I tell you I never saw her!
- How long had you known she was colored?
- I didn't care! I didn't care!
But you did care about your scholarship.
It didn't carry a grant for a wife, did it? If you married Sapphire, the scholarship was off.
I loved her!
I
- I tell you I loved Sapphire.
Where were you when she was killed?
Yes?
Oh, excuse me, sir.
Mr. David Harris's father is here with a solicitor.
Right.
All right, Harris.
You'd better go with him, Phil.
Ralph Piggot.
Piggot, North & Piggot. Finsbury Pavement.
Mr. Harris asked me to come and look after his son.
Can I see my client, please?
He's all yours.
Tough monkey that father. Must have moved like the wind to get a lawyer around here.
Yeah. There they go.
Hmm.
I wonder where he was on Saturday night.
They're getting into a taxi now.
Going over to the Ritz to find a witness, I'll bet. Hmm.
That was a very human lie. Boy didn't want to upset his father.
Couldn't own up later. He was in too deep.
Where was he on Saturday night?
- Who?
- Old Harris.
Oh, at the, uh, local social club.
Did we check it? All right, don't look so horrified.
We can't think of everything, not even us.
Constable Ferris is also a member of that social club.
No, sir. Ted Harris didn't come into the club till late on Saturday night.
About 10:00. That's definite.
- All right, Ferris.
- Sir.
Not until 10:00, eh?
He gave us the impression he'd been there all evening.
No, he didn't. No. His daughter took it for granted, and we naturally followed.
I think I'll go round and see her... try and bounce her into giving something away.
We still haven't had the report on Johnnie Fiddle's knife.
No, we've got that to come. Drive round to that dairy, will you?
Of course Dad spent the evening at the club. He always does Saturdays.
My information is he didn't get there until 10:00.
You're not trying to suggest that he had anything to do with it?
I'm not saying he did. I merely want to know where he was.
Then ask him, Superintendent.
- Did Sapphire often go to your house?
- Yes.
I suppose, really, you were all as much to blame as David.
- What do you mean?
- You shouldn't have made her so welcome... if you didn't want him involved with a colored girl.
We didn't know she was colored, not until -
Not until when, Mrs. Farr?
Not until Saturday, was it? The day she was killed.
My father didn't do it,
I swear, Superintendent.
You can search the house from top to bottom.
You'll not find a speck of blood or a trace of Sapphire.
Thank you, Mrs. Farr.
I'm peckish, Lilly.
Slip across to Mac's and get me a ham sandwich, will you?
Well, go on.
No. Old Harris can't be back yet, or he'd answer that phone.
No, wait a minute.
- She'll ring again.
- Who?
- Mildred.
- Oh, there's no one in.
Mrs. Harris has gone down to
Richmond, and Milly's at the dairy.
Oh, thank you.
You might find Mr. Harris in the paint shed, but you'll have to go round the yard at the back for that.
Thanks.
No, he's not here.
I'd like to know what's underneath that dust sheet.
We haven't got enough evidence to get a search warrant for this place.
No.
It was expecting too much.
Saturday night, packed house. How could she remember?
You didn't make this up on the spur of the moment, did you?
If the boy says he went to the pictures, he went to the pictures.
You sound like the police.
If I'm going to help you, I've got to think like the police.
It's no use boggling. They've got a very good circumstantial case.
They've got no case at all. The boy didn't do it.
- And if you can't clear him, I will.
- You hope you can. That's what you mean.
- I know I can. I know I can.
- Shut up talking across me.
He's never talked to me like that in his life.
Perhaps there's a side to the boy you've never seen, Mr. Harris.
I know my own son.
He didn't kill Sapphire.
I know he didn't.
- Tell Sergeant Newton I want him right away.
- Very good, sir.
Right. Thank you.
Report from the lab, Bob.
The blood on Johnnie Fiddle's shirt is the same group as the girl's... and his knife could have inflicted the wounds.
- Right. Let's have him up.
- Okay.
- Uh, you wanted me, sir?
- Oh, Newton.
Get a warrant to search all the sheds at the back of Oakland Road.
Say we're looking for stolen lead.
- I want to see inside Harris's paint shop.
- Right, sir.
Is this yours, Johnnie?
No, boss. No.
Then what was it doing in your mattress on your bed?
Someone put it there. He
- He put it there!
- What?
- All right.
The blood found on this knife, on your shirt...
matches Sapphire's blood.
And what about this?
You and Sapphire, isn't it?
Did you kill her, Johnnie? Did you?
No, boss. No!
- The blood matches.
- Not Sapphire's blood.
Then whose, you big lug?
Horace Big Cigar.
We fight Saturday night.
Why the hell didn't you say this before?
- They say I kill him, boss.
- They say?
- Who saw this fight?
- Them.
Them? Who's "them"?
Alexander, Gin Ricky, Big Sam.
- Where do we find these people?
- Number 16, down the street from my place.
It was self-defense, boss.
Horace Big Cigar attack me. I not mean to kill him.
I'll bet.
No, no. I cover. I cover it.
Okay, come on, baby.
- You take it.
- Eight point, huh?
- Eight.
- Eight.
- Baby wants new shoes.
- Seven out. Seven out.
What's your name?
Horace Big Cigar. What's yours, man?
This man's the law. Now, no ignorant, foolish talk. Mind?
All right, Horace.
According to our information,
Horace, you're dead.
Incorrect.
Not ready for my coffin yet.
- Where were you Saturday night, Horace?
- Right here, boss.
- Why are you in bed?
- Sick man, boss.
Very sick.
How come?
- How'd you get that?
- Oh, hit by a jumble car.
What car?
Knocked out. Had no opportunity to see the vehicle.
Johnnie Fiddle one big lie then, huh?
What you say, boss? What you sayJohnnie Fiddle done?
We're booking him for the killing on Hampstead Heath Saturday night.
That's whatJohnnie Fiddle done.
- Sapphire - that chick that got cut up? - The same.
That sure is one big pity.
Johnnie Fiddle in plenty trouble, eh?
You hear that, men? Saturday night.
You really booking Johnnie Fiddle, boss?
Unless you can give him an out. He says he was with you.
You sure wastin' your time.
I got no out forJohnnie Fiddle.
You go
- hang him.
Is that where the jumble car knocked you down, Horace?
You sure wise man, boss.
- Alexander.
- Yes, boss?
- Gin Ricky.
- Yes, boss?
- Big Sam.
- Yes, boss?
Why did you tellJohnnie Fiddle he'd killed Horace Big Cigar?
Johnnie Fiddle wears too much of a high hat.
We seek a way to knock it off.
Make that big bushman sweat, boss.
- Were they all here Saturday night?
- All here, boss.
Right. Names.
- You.
- Alexander.
I'll go, Ted.
We're in here.
Did you find what you wanted?
I think so.
Well?
I've just seen Sapphire's brother.
I've asked him to call round here.
- Not her brother.
- We don't want him here.
You had better tell him that yourself.
He'll be here in a minute.
I said we don't want him here.
I want him.
I wonder if Sapphire would have been happy here.
What do you think, Mr. Harris?
Why shouldn't she be?
I don't know. I'm asking you.
Answer the door.
How do you do?
How do you do?
I'm Mrs. Harris.
- Will you sit down?
- Thank you.
Dr. Robbins.
I've asked you to come here because
I think you may be able to help us.
If I can.
Did Sapphire want to marry this boy?
Yes, I
- I think she did.
Well, David's father here has been insisting all along... that he was willing to let them marry.
That's right.
Assuming he's telling the truth, that would have left the decision with David.
Did your sister give you the impression that he would have married her?
Well, I don't know that I can answer that.
I mean, we - we really never discussed -
I've told you over and over again. Yes.
But supposing your father were lying and didn't want you to marry her?
I didn't care.
But you cared about your scholarship, didn't you? You cared about your career.
- Marriage would have stopped all that.
- It wasn't me that was mad about the career.
So you say. I wouldn't know.
You may have thought that a bit of fun was one thing... but that marriage was too high a price to pay for it.
This boy couldn't do anything like -
- We don't need you to defend our David.
- Mildred.
How about you, Mr. Harris?
You had your reasons, too, didn't you?
- I didn't wish her any harm.
- Of course not.
She was going to marry David.
That's what you said, wasn't it?
That's right. And I gave him my word he would.
But she didn't marry him, did she?
- She would have done.
- Would have done?
- If you hadn't stopped her. Is that what you mean?
- That's not true.
I didn't wish her any harm. None of us did. We liked her. We liked her!
If David wanted her, that was the end-
- That was good enough.
- Shut up!
Why don't you tell him the truth? You hated her!
All you ever wanted was for me to be an architect.
"My boy-an architect. ' '
You were going to send me away, but you-
You hated her so much that you finally-
Get him out!
Don't want his hands on my kids' toys! Don't want him near my kids!
Don't want his dirty hands on my children!
Tearing up my family. They're mine.
You really hate colored people, don't you?
You really hate them.
And with Sapphire, you couldn't control yourself.
And that's why you killed her.
It wasn't like that.
It wouldn't have happened if she hadn't come to the dairy.
I'd locked up, drawn the blinds.
She banged on the door and called to me.
I had to let her in.
She said she was fed up waiting for David and wanted my company.
She sat on the counter all the time I was tidying up - sweeping, doing Lilly's work- swinging her legs and laughing.
She couldn't see what she'd done. She didn't care.
Ruining David's life... ruining Dad's dream.
When I said she'd better watch out...
David might prefer to give her 10 bob a week for the yellow brat... and keep his scholarship... she laughed in my face and said David didn't care what color the baby was... or what color she was, he wanted her.
And I'd forgotten what that was like. I'd forgotten what it was like to be wanted.
She was taunting me with
Sid never coming home.
Then she jumped down from the counter, put her hand on my shoulder and said...
"Give the twins Auntie Sapphire's love... and tell them they'll have a new little cousin soon. "
"New little cousin. "
There was a knife on the counter.
And then there was blood.
I'm sorry, Dad.
I
- I know, Son.
You thought I killed her.
I don't blame you.
We all had hate in our hearts.
I loved Sapphire.
I loved her.
Yes, I believe you did.
- Are you going back to Birmingham tonight?
- Yes.
- Can we give you a lift to the station?
- Thank you, I'd like to walk.
Well.
We haven't given you very much to take back, have we, Doctor?
No.
But then I see all kinds of sickness in my practice, Superintendent.
I've never yet seen the kind you can cure in a day.
Cases don't get solved without somebody getting hurt.
You know that.
We didn't solve anything, Phil.
We just picked up the pieces.

# I'd fly up high #
# Up in the sky #
Shut it in and prime the port engine, can't you, Dray?
Okay, corp.
# If I only had wings... #
Go on, rupt yourself, do!
Stand up!
- Well, what's your name?
- Milliken, sir.
Who are you, what are you?
Armorer, electrician, sanitary welder?
Medical orderly, sir.
Told to report to 2561.
Medical orderly?
Well, what was you in civvy street, a chartered accountant?
- No, sir.
- Don't call me sir.
Save your sirs for the skipper.
He's an officer and knows nothing...
...and therefore entitled to be called sir.
See these?
These indicate the most important rank in the Royal Air Force.
Oy, now then.
What am I?
- A Flight Sergeant.
- And don't you forget it!
No, Flight.
Flight, he says.
Just like that.
What the war does for the Air Force.
When I joined the service it was,
"Yes, Flight Sergeant.", "No, Flight Sergeant."
Three bags full, Flight Sergeant.
Stand still!
My name's Slingsby.
Flight Sergeant Slingsby.
I drink blood and eat grenades.
- Morning, lads.
- Morning, sir. All right, son, fall out.
- Move on, sir? On to sea?
- Tell the engine to start up.
Aye, aye, sir.
Start up, below.
Okay, Dray, start them up.
- Let go springs.
- Springs out, sir.
- Let go out!
- All gone out, sir.
Let go fore head?
All done fore head, sir.
Fire the engine, Clarkson.
- First trip?
- Yes, corporal.
- It's nice and smoothe, isn't it?
- Yeah.
Just another pleasure cruise.
Come on, big time, there's no time for sleeping.
You're in the way.
Over in the bunk, go on!
Robbie, I'm going to change.
Okay, Chiefy.
Have some corned-beef sandwich?
Best in the world, this is.
Here, doc.
- Put that on.
- Thanks, corporal.
There's an overcoat in there if you want it. It's gonna be cold.
Oh, you.
You married?
- No.
- Lucky you.
What's happened? We stopped.
Hey, Gus, do you reckon we'll be back on time?
- Why, are you in a hurry?
- Yes, I am.
Well, we won't then.
You'd better get your head down, Doc.
We've got a long way ahead of us.
Why, where are we?
We're on what's called rendez-vous.
We're going to stay here until somebody tells us to go home.
It's exciting, ain't it?
- You all right, Skip?
- I'm all right, give me a hand.
- Through the hatch, sir, up above.
- Right.
How are the others?
The dinghy's been ejected.
Make your way along to the wing, sir.
Will you finish buckling the belt?
Get in the dinghy.
The craft's going down any minute.
Come on, Skip, let's help him.
Any more for the skylark?
We got a long way to go.
You all right, Skip?
Yes, I'm all right. I got a bit of a whack in the bread basket...
- ...when we ditched, that's all.
- What happened exactly?
We got poked in the engine by a Messershmidt.
But if it's any consolation,
I returned the compliment.
Right now Jerry's on the North Sea, too, sitting on his own little rubber mat.
Boy, is he going to be lonely.
Do you think anyone saw us ditch, Canada?
I shouldn't think so.
I didn't see any ships or anything.
- Where are we exactly?
- Just off the coast of Holland, sir.
About 20 miles from the show.
And a long way from home.
Guess we'd better get organized.
- Canada, can you get that small box going?
- Right.
- Mac, can you set up the aerial?
- Yep.
- Would you mind helping, sir?
- Oh, of course, I'm in your hands.
All I want is to get this briefcase back safely to England.
You just treat me as one of the crew.
She's going.
Well, that's that.
Makes you think, doesn't it?
If any of us had anything sharp on us, rip, zip, and we'd be sitting on about
500 fathoms of ocean and nothing else.
Yes, sir, this little piece of rubber is all there is between us...
... and the bottom of the deep blue sea.
Come in.
- Yes, Flight?
- The weather's getting worse, sir.
- I've posted two bridge lookouts.
- Right.
By the way, how's the new boy?
His name's Milliken, sir.
Herbert Milliken.
- He's a bit seasick, but he'll do.
- You'll get him up to standard, anyway.
- Coffee?
- Thank you very much, sir.
Thank you.
- Is it true about the rumor, sir?
- Yes, this is my last trip.
I'm checking out of the unit at Gosport.
It's a promotion anyway.
I expect the wife's pleased.
How is she?
I took her to the hospital an hour before we left.
The baby's due any moment now.
Oh, by the way, my wife made this.
She asked me to give it with you.
It's a grey coat.
It'll fit a boy or a girl.
It's a nice cozy one.
Thank your wife for me, will you?
- I most certainly will.
- How's your boy?
- Well, he's let me down, sir.
- Why?
He joined the Navy yesterday.
Not again, Milliken!
I don't seem to be able to stop.
I knew a fellow once in the early days of air-sea rescue, he were a medical orderly, too.
He died from seasickness.
He strained his stomach.
Oh, it was a horrible sight.
Hi, Doc, still alive?
- How are you feeling?
- Sick.
There's hot soup in the forecastle.
Come on, I'll get you some.
Self-heated soup! I never touch it.
I don't trust them chemicals.
Come on, chap, get up on deck, you're on.
All right, corp.
Fill your bowls with this.
When's the return to base coming through, Robb?
I'm sick of this bit of sea.
The other bits are just the same.
I never want to see another boat after the war as long as I live.
Ten men and a medical orderly crammed aboard this tub.
What's the matter, Skinner?
Danger of losing a date?
Yeah, a WAF. She promised to see me last night at the station dance tonight.
I thought you were supposed to be overhauling the oil feed...
...on the port engine last night.
- Oh, I did that in 10 minutes.
- I thought it was a big job.
Duke said it would take all night.
The engines got us here and they'll get us back.
Come and take this message, will you, Knox?
There you are, Skinner, the one thing you can do well.
Return to base.
- Hey, Chiefy, Chiefy!
- What's up, Marshall?
There's a kite in the drink northeast of here.
Knox is just decoding them and they're not quite sure of it.
- Get up!
- Return to base, Flight?
Kite the drink.
Start up!
- Kite in the drink, sir.
- Come on boys, there's a kite in the drink.
This is it, Milliken, we're going to war.
- Ahead all speed, Flight.
- Ahead all speed, sir.
4050, 2000 revs.
Good morning.
Come in.
At ease.
- Good morning, sir.
- Sit down.
- Poor show, this.
- Yes, nothing further, I suppose?
We've had a signal.
The Hudson took off at 11:20.
The Air Commodore Waltby was definitely on board.
- It was that one?
- Looks like it.
There's no other aircraft reported overdue.
Not so far anyway.
If they are in the drink, there's a pretty fair chance of their being picked up.
They've got to be picked up.
I've had London on the phone.
Waltby was carrying a briefcase.
It's vital that neither he nor the briefcase shall be lost.
I know Waltby's number one buff on unguided missiles but...
I wonder what was in the briefcase.
It seems our people over there got hold of some papers.
Formula, blueprints, and so on.
Waltby was sent over to identify them.
London had word from him yesterday.
He's got the follow-on to the B-1 and the B-2.
I wonder if the Jerries knew about Waltby.
And deliberately shot them down?
I doubt it.
I'm going to see what's happening.
- Thanks. I'll keep you posted.
- Thank you, sir.
- Ah, Dray.
- Good morning, sir.
- Which is the Hudson?
- Here, sir.
It's only an approximate position, of course, sir.
I can't understand why we didn't get a better one.
Flight Sergeant MacKay is a good wireless operator.
If in fact the signal came from Harding's aircraft.
Oh, quite, sir.
We're only guessing.
There's still time to hear the Force landed somewhere in this country.
- Who picked the signal out?
- They heard that it Fellwell and Harbury.
A weak mayday signal without a call sign...
...lasting just long enough for them to get enough bearing.
Probably Harding's last chip before he ditched.
Yes, sir.
They've apparently got Air Commodore
Waltby with them, of course?
Yes, sir.
Do you know him, sir?
He's my brother-in-law.
The plane's the best part of an hour overdue.
Any shipping in the vicinity?
There are air-sea rescue launches north and south in the area.
What about Coastal Command?
They've got a couple of Sea Otters in the job and the Navy have sent at least one.
There's always the chance of an aircraft in the area picking up the signal, I suppose?
With a squawk box in a dinghy?
Oh, yes.
- What's the picture on the weather?
- A bit dicey, sir.
I'll get Commander Peeple to send someone up.
- Tell him to come to my office, will you?
- Very good, sir.
Main office?
- Good morning, sir.
- Morning, Scotty.
- Do you want me? I'm rather busy.
- I shan't keep you long, sir.
Well, all right.
I found something rather interesting this morning, sir.
Now, sir. What about this?
Rather wizard, I think.
I suggest we hang one up in the mess somewhere, shall we?
You're the adman officer, Scotty.
I leave it to you.
Roger, sir.
I'm just on my way to the canteen to give the boys a lecture on post-war planning.
- I might hang one up there too.
- Oh, you fix it, Scotty,
I'm rather occupied at the moment.
By the way, sir, about this ensign company... who's supposed to be giving a show here on Sunday. I...
Come in.
- Ah, Hart. Well, what's the picture?
- I'm afraid we're in for a nasty blow, sir.
What I really want to talk about, sir, is the new bus service to town.
Deal with it yourself, Scotty.
Roger, sir.
Stoneway reports clouds at 500 ft, heavy rain and a gale-force wind.
No flying.
That's about 400 miles north of here, isn't it?
- Yes, sir.
- How long before it reaches us?
It'll be here by this time tomorrow, if not before.
Just a bright day for flying, that's all we want.
The barometer is falling a little already, sir.
I guarantee that every time anyone ditches...
...the weather immediately starts to make things as difficult as possible.
When I ditched in 1940 it took two days to find me.
I never felt so cold and lonely in all my life.
As a matter of academic interest, has one of these things ever been known to turn over?
Judging by the way this one's behaving at the moment,
I reckon it can turn itself inside out if it tried real hard.
There's a whole lot of water getting in here.
Is there something I can bail with?
That briefcase would make a good bailer.
How about it, sir?
- I think not.
- You could shove the papers in your pockets.
- I think not.
- I don't see why...
Enough, Mac!
Do you think anybody's getting a signal from that thing, Canada?
- Sure, if it's working.
- It's working, all right.
Just as you say, bud.
It's a pity we didn't get a signal out before we ditched.
I hadn't got a chance, had I?
I made out a couple of maydays and the transmitter...
...went to pieces right in front of me eyes.
Sure, so nobody's got a bearing on us.
- At least not a good one.
- I did what I was supposed to do!
Keep your hair on, Mac.
Nobody's fault.
I mean, who'd expect to find a Jerry here at this time of the war?
Anyway, it helps to know he's got a wet behind, too.
It don't help mine any.
How long is it since we came down?
About 4 hours, sir.
It'll be dark in another hour or so.
Think of that.
And me, I had a date tonight.
Not another new popsy, Canada?
Not a new one.
Same as last week. And the week before.
Don't tell me it's the real thing this time.
Sure is. Hell, I didn't pluck up the courage to kiss her for two nights running.
That proves it then, doesn't it?
All right, I'll take it.
Come on, time we had some food.
Let's get the bag, Allan.
Better start on a strict ration right away.
We don't know how long we're going to make this lot last
Is it getting darned cold?
A nice warm blanket would be just the job now.
Look, Steve, here's my jacket.
I don't need it.
I've got a jacket.
You keep yours for yourself.
- But I can get a bang on the guts.
- I don't feel the cold, honest.
Don't be a clod, Mac.
If you don't feel the cold you must be dead or something.
No, you keep your jacket on.
Well, well, well!
Water purifying tablets.
That's gonna be real handy with all this sea around us.
What are those?
Oh, biscuits. They're useful.
And energy tablets.
Say, they think of everything.
Cigarettes, chewing gum...
...compass, and...
My, my, what a delicate thought!
Toilet paper.
All right...
One food tablet and one biscuit each for this meal.
What, no coffee and licors?
Oh, that reminds me.
- Brandy.
- Brandy?
No wonder you didn't want to let that case go, sir.
We'd better keep that till we need it.
What, when we're too weak to taste it?
Not in your life! Let's have it now while we can enjoy it.
Let's die happy.
- What do you think, sir?
- I think a little nip around will do us good.
- Here, you first.
- No, after you.
Carry on.
I got it.
Go on.
Thanks.
Okay, sea, I'm ready for you now.
This would happen to me.
We'll never get back to London now.
I don't know what you're talking about, Tebbitt.
She can't get a train to London till midday tomorrow. So long as we're back by noon...
No, I know the wife.
Of course, blimey, I ought to.
Look, she says here...
If you are not back home tonight
I am going to London.
There is someone there who loves me and who will not leave me alone...
...all the time like you do.
Who is this bloke, have you got any idea?
How should I know, with her living in town and me stuck in camp?
Maybe she only wrote that to put the wind up you.
No, Wilda's always wanted to get back to London.
B1s, B2s, she don't mind.
She misses the pubs, and dance halls, and things like that.
Maybe we'll make it back tonight even yet.
I bet we don't. Even if we do pick up them fellows in the dinghy...
...we'll probably hit a bloody mine or something.
Here, you take over.
- Comfy, Tebbitt?
- That's right.
It's not all right. There's an aircraft over there and it's coming this way in fast.
- Sir, I'd seen it...
- Well, report it, you berk.
Aircraft approaching from starboard.
It's a Sunderland.
Thank you very much!
- What's that, Robby?
- Cocoa.
Give us a cup, will you?
- Any sign of anything yet?
- Nah!
What's up, Flight?
Ah, that Tebbitt.
Drives you up a wall.
He's all right. He's a good boy when it comes to the pick-up.
Oh, sure, they're all good boys when they're on the job.
The problem is keeping them going in between times.
You don't mind that, do you?
You think I like chasing Tebbitt?
It's my job, that's all.
Look at young Milliken.
Do you think I like chasing him?
- He hasn't complain, has he?
- No, he's got guts, all right.
They have to learn the hard way, same as you did.
You were a civilian for the duration, weren't you?
Well, you made it, and so will he.
And the same way.
With punishing flight sergeants chasing from butt holes to breakfast time.
But I was a bit older.
Maybe you were.
But he'll grow old.
I'll see to that.
Oy!
You're the sergeant.
And the sergeant's got to be tough, eh?
That's right.
Ever a Beau Geste.
- How are the engines, baby?
- No complaints.
Bet you're beginning to wish now you hadn't skipped those repairs last night.
Ah, get stuffed, you.
Listen, son.
A damaged oil feed can stop the engines stone dead, and you know it.
All you can do now is hope and be ready.
Ah!
How long is it since we ditched?
About ten hours, I imagine.
Why the hell couldn't look for us in the daylight?
They must be somewhere about.
They can't be far away.
You're the only one who wants to get out of here, bud.
My girlfriend's waiting for me back there.
I reckon in just about an hour
I'll be kissing her good night.
That's all you ever think about, isn't it?
Beer, and girls, and going to the pictures.
Well, I've got other things to think about.
I'm not going to spend the rest of my life in this blasted dinghy.
If the sea gets much rougher, you won't have to worry about that, Mac.
Wait a minute.
Are you all right, Skip?
Yeah, I'm all right.
- A bit stiff.
- A bit stiff.
Here.
Listen, MacKay, and you, Kirby.
If anything should happen to me, this briefcase has got to go overboard, do you understand?
And if we're picked up by an enemy vessel, take the strap of this squawk box, pull it through and tie it tight, and drop it overboard so that it sinks fast.
Did you get that?
Okay, sir.
Is that understood, MacKay?
Why don't you throw it overboard now and have it done with it?
It's brought us only but bad luck.
Listen, MacKay, up to now I haven't reminded you that I have got a certain rank.
When I ask you to do something it's an order.
Did you hear that?
Yes, sir.
Right. We won't talk anymore about the briefcase.
It's about time we did some more exercise. Come on.
It's the damn water we're sitting in.
I've had pins and needles on my behind for the last hour or more.
I can't get rid of it.
Still, if it's just the job for working up an appetite, boy, am I looking forward to my next energy tablet.
- Come on, MacKay!
- Oh, what's the use?
It's a waste of time anyway.
Come on, for goodness' sake.
Do something, stop arguing.
We'll have a song, too.
On and on...
On and on...
Away, pull and tug.
Dear God.
We are four men here... on a pretty tough spot.
I know You've got a lot to think about but... please, try and not forget us.
Our trust is in You.
And if You could possibly see Your way clear getting us somewhere dry, we'd be very grateful.
Amen.
Amen.
Amen.
I say, what's the trouble?
It's nothing, sir.
Come along now, you're not crying for nothing.
Nothing, sir, really.
I say...
You're one of the mess clerks, aren't you?
- Yes, sir.
- Well, can't I help?
- That's what I'm here for, you know.
- Yes, sir, I...
I suppose you haven't heard any news of Mr. Harding's crew, have you, sir?
Oh, I see.
Well, uh...
Look, I was just going to see the Group
Captain, I'll find out what's happening.
Who is it you're interested in?
- Sergeant Kirby, sir.
- Your boyfriend, right?
- We're nearly engaged, sir.
- Jolly good show.
You hang on here and I'll let you know.
- Thank you, sir.
- Think nothing of it.
Come in.
- Good evening, sir.
- Evening, Scotty.
- Sorry to bother you so late, sir.
- Is it important?
- I'm afraid so, sir. Any news of Harding?
- No.
Well, this is about Flight Sgt. MacKay.
He's with Harding, isn't he?
MacKay? What about MacKay?
Well, sir, the station police have found a Jerry kind of petrol in his car, you know, that old Morris he runs about in.
Seems it fell off the back of a motor transport...
...and the police corporal spotted MacKay picking it up after dark.
For sure, sir, fetching petrol is a Court Martial offense.
- Has the corporal reported it?
- Yes.
- That means a charge will be made out.
- Afraid so, sir.
MacKay's a good wireless operator.
He was put in for commission with me.
That's right, sir.
It's all he could do altogether.
What do you feel should be the drill?
There was a sergeant at Fell Borough who took a jerry can of petrol, I remember, in similar circumstances. Stealing by finding, I suppose you'd call it.
That's right, sir. Court Martial and reduced at the ranks.
Then, shortly afterwards he was given his rank back...
...and was eventually killed over Essen.
Oh, was he, sir?
I didn't remember that.
No.
Anyway, nothing much can be done about it until MacKay gets back.
If he gets back.
By the way, sir, about this ensign show on Sunday,
I was wondering if we couldn't possibly...
Roger, sir.
Did you find out, sir?
Oh... yes, my dear.
Well, there's no need to worry.
- They're going to be all right.
- You mean they've found him, sir?
Well, they know where they are.
It's just a matter of time.
- He is all right, isn't he, sir?
- Of course he is.
He'll be on the telephone through the
War Effort before you know where you are.
- Now, you run along and don't worry.
- Thank you, sir.
I've been in touch with the Navy at Dover. sir.
If it gets no worse they think the dinghy will rough the night.
- And if it does get worse?
- I'm not so sure.
I wish we knew where they were.
If they can hold out till daylight, there's still a chance.
We'll get everything that can fly off the ground at first light, unless there's thick fog or heavy rain.
- What's the temperature, Howard?
- Low, sir. Cold and raw.
Possibly some frost on the way.
It could be pretty grim out there.
Could you get a new piece of chalk, corporal?
Sorry, sir.
Oh, Flight! 2559 is around.
I've just picked up a signal.
- They've called airmen to search now.
- Very good. Where is she?
Due north of here.
Well, here we go again.
It'll be the usual, Ryce.
Three tours on the point of a pick-up, and each time fire on us was pitiless.
Next time I'll pull out her bungs and scuttle her.
What's this?
I tied us all... all together.
And that... case...
In case one of us..
...went overboard.
Oh, yeah...
- How's the skip.
- I'm all right, Canada.
How's yourself?
Lousy.
Came the dawn.
Skip, would you like some food?
- No?
- No.
This damn wind...
...taking us closer to the Dutch coast all the time.
Where are they?
It can't take them all this time.
They're...
They're just not trying.
Him and his blasted little bag.
What if he has got Jerry secrets in it?
The war's nearly over now.
Pipe down, Mac.
Whining's not gonna get us anywhere.
Bloody charm we're under...
He... he can't fall himself...
...so he has to take us in the drink too.
Oh, the hell, Mac.
He's a nice enough guy.
What's he doing in the Air Force anyway?
Earning his living?
Not likely.
I know his type.
Constable over his camp... pink gins in the mess...
Mac...
I don't think they served any pink gins in the last six weeks.
Why? Did the mess run out of gin or something?
Did you ever make a parachute jump, Mac?
No.
He did. To get all the stuff that's in that bag.
Made his way through...
...occupied territory for heaven knows...
...how many miles to get it back.
Not so many miles, Harding.
Only about 6 km, actually.
Pretty sticky ones, though.
- What's happened to your boots?
- Hm?
Your boots!
Oh, Skipper's got them on.
He only had shoes on.
How are you feeling?
I'm all right.
I don't feel the cold.
He flew through the air with the greatest of ease
The bold, daring man on the flying trapeze.
He flew through the air with the...
One more leg, Ted, then we head for home.
Set out the course, will you, Ted?
Yep.
Wouldn't like to be in the drink in this weather.
Lord knows I'm fed up with these Sea Otters.
To hell with ditching in a kite that won't float.
Accomplished course 270.
Turning at 5 minutes exact.
Roger dodger.
Listen! Listen!
It's one of ours.
Say, Mac, you'll capsize us.
- Where's the flare?
- I've got it.
Wait a minute, Mac.
Let's see the aircraft first.
- There it is!
- Where?
- I can't see it! Where?
- I can, sir. Over there!
- Have you got the flare ready?
- I can't. I'm too cold.
Hey! We're here!
Here we are!
Hey! Hey!
Hey!
Hurry up, man!
It's a Sea Otter. They're searching for us.
Hurry up with that flare!
- Hurry up, man, for God's sake or we'll miss it.
- It won't come, I can't help it!
- Let me try, here!
It's turning away. It's heading south.
It's too late, I'm afraid.
- We're here! Here we are!
- Hey!
Hey! Hey!
It's no good, fellows.
They can't hear us.
No wonder they didn't spot us.
Why weren't you turning that thing?
I was turning it.
Why didn't they hear us then?
Got a hell of a clout when we ditched.
Maybe it's busted.
You're the wireless operator.
You ought to know.
Knock it off you two.
Quarreling won't help.
Nobody's fault.
They're all the same.
They don't care.
They're warm.
Skipper's passed out.
- Wish we could have found them.
- Me too.
The weather's closing in.
If we don't head for home, we'll be in the drink ourselves.
Come on, you old string bag.
Twenty miles an hour flat out.
The wind and tide behind her.
Bloody taxi driver, that's what I am.
Hey, can you see something down there?
- Huh?
- Look!
- Yeah, it looks like a dinghy.
- I'm going down.
It isn't what we're looking for.
It must be a fighter boy.
I'm going down to pick him up.
Made it!
It's rougher than I thought.
Stand by, Ted.
Johnny, it's a Jerry.
Grab the rope!
Hang on tight!
Come on, you sausage-eating baboon!
Don't panic!
We're getting you!
Danke... danke shoen.
Danke shoen.
I wonder if he's seen anything of the other dinghy.
- Did you see another dinghy? No?
- A dinghy.
- No English. No speak English.
- He doesn't speak English.
Where, what happened?
Who shot you down?
Bomber... attack.
Hudson! Must be the one we're looking for.
- Where was it? Where was it?
- Wo war der Hudson?
He must be the character that shot the Hudson down.
They probably got a pop at him and shot him down too.
Better get him back in the damn tub, too.
Yeah, let's get going.
We haven't any time to waste.
Now we're in trouble.
Someday I'm gonna meet the guy that invented these tripe machines.
Better get busy on the buzzer and contact base and tell them where we are.
Then climb out on the wing and see what the score is, will you?
What about him?
He's in pretty bad shape.
I hope he can hold on until they question him.
I hope so.
Danke.
Danke shoen.
- 59's pretty close now.
- Wonder which is gonna pick up the dinghy.
I bet it's 59. You couldn't pick up a curl in the head.
Hold it!
Yes, that's all right.
Procede... immediately... to assistance... of damaged Sea Otter... tow back to base.
That's due south of here.
Away from the search area.
Oh, now, 61 always gets the dirty jobs.
This boat's got a jinx on it.
Visibility's not so good, Flight.
Still good enough to spot trouble, sir.
See what I see?
Full speed!
Skipper! Sea Otter in the drink by the sound of it, sir.
Signal, sir.
Ahoy, there, 61!
I see they're taking you out of the search.
Well, well, well!
Never mind, you're better off doing an honest job of towing.
They're only using us because we can tow the Sea Otter and search.
- Anyway, good luck with the pick-up.
- Keep your trousers dry.
Head off, Flight.
Head off, aye, sir.
We'll never get back before the train leaves now.
- That's me last chance up the spout.
- That's right, chum, you've had it.
I bet she'll be wearing her new coat.
Ten quid that cost me, you know?
With the gloves in the act.
She's daft about money, dead daft.
She said she wanted it to go with her green suitcase I bought her for Christmas.
I bet she takes that with her, too.
Yeah, and the knives, and the forks, and the family jewels.
That's all right for you to talk, you're not married.
No, and after serving in this lot with you, chum, I'm staying that way.
Phooey! After 20 years of this game
I'm posted to a tug.
- Five-man passengers, that's all.
- Oughtn't to be.
- It's just a ship built at the same time.
- They have a better fitter that we have.
Yes, that's true.
Ah, Skinner!
He should have been a tailor.
Al he's interested in is trousers and skirts.
Weather report, sir.
Gale blowing up.
- Do you think they want me, corporal?
- Damn, get out of the way, can't you?
Skinner!
Oh, there you are. What's up?
- The water pumps are packed up, Flight.
- Water pumps?
Yes, sir, both of them.
The engines are overheating.
There's no water coming through.
How is it that both the water pumps are packed altogether, Skinner?
Well, sir, the keys have sheared.
They have a habit of shearing at awkward moments.
What are you going to do about it then?
- Dismantle the pumps and fit new keys.
- How long will it take?
It'll take about 2 hours, sir.
I'll have to make new keys.
- Haven't you any spare keys?
- That's right.
Not like the boat
I was on before, sir.
The fitter there he made spare keys.
They were in his kit.
Why haven't you?
Why not?
- Well, you see...
- Come on, Skinner, out with it!
Well, sir, it's pretty busy down there with only two of us.
- None of the boats have more than 2 fitters.
- Yes, sir, but...
Skinner, how long did it take you to fix the oil feed last night?
It took me about 3 hours, sir.
I don't believe you took 10 minutes at the most!
- How long did it take you?
- Well, it took me about...
Go on, get back there to make those new keys.
I'll sort you out when we get back.
Hang around.
- Knox.
- Yes, sir?
Send a signal to base.
Tell them we've broken down and we can't pick up the Sea Otter.
Sir.
Pick it up, Skinner!
Go on!
- Pick it up and get on with it!
- But, Flight, it's bleeding.
Lovely!
I'd like to see you bleed slowly to death, master-flaming-corporal Skinner.
Go on, get on with it!
I'll just strip off a bit, Flight, it's pretty hot...
There's no time for stripping off, master-flaming-corporal Skinner!
Maybe you'll sweat to death.
If you do, I'll read the burial service when they push you over the side.
I'll be the first to shout per ardua ad astra as you go down.
And you're gonna be hanging I'll bloody well push you down with a boat hook!
Fire away!
I'll be watching you.
- How's it going, son?
- All right, Flight, it's coming off.
How long's it gonna take?
- A day at this rate.
- All day?
Well, the first sea lord here is gonna be back in a couple of hours.
He'll be lucky.
Thanks, Flight.
Launch on stern quarter, sir.
Ahoy, there, 61!
Broken down again?
Never mind, we're on the job.
We'll find the Sea Otter and tow her in.
Much obliged to you!
You're welcome. And we'll come back for you in the morning if you like.
Very funny, ha-ha.
I'll make a note of where you are in case you're not sure.
Shall I give you your position?
I know where I am, thank you.
You'd better let the Navy know we're here.
If this weather gets worse, we might need help.
We'll probably come back for you ourselves.
Have a good day.
You'll get a medal for this.
He knows what he can do with his blasted medals.
Hold on, 61, I'll pass on your message.
Good luck!
All right, you move along, on the bridge.
All right, Flight.
You'll all end up with double pneumonia this flight, I'm telling you.
Milliken, get me some cocoa.
Well, I've been 20 years in the Marine Corps but I never knew anyone like Skinner.
There's a gale warning out, Flight.
Everybody's been recalled.
And we had to stop here. All because of Master Skinner. Ain't it marvelous?
I keep telling you, kid.
There's no Sergeant Kirby here.
We're keeping beds ready and hot-water bottles...
...but they haven't even found them yet.
From what I heard in the ops room they don't even know where they are.
That can't be true!
Squadron Leader Scott definitely said last night that they'd been found.
He was only saying that to cheer you up.
No, he wasn't. He said they knew where the dinghy was and...
Listen to me. If they had found Kirby or any of them, I'd know, wouldn't I?
Sorry, kid. Keep your chin up.
Excuse me.
I couldn't help overhearing.
I'm afraid Sqn. Ldr. Scott misled you.
He meant well, of course.
- They haven't found them then.
- No.
We've had no luck at all so far.
We're assuming they got into their dinghy safely and that they're still afloat.
But we can only guess at where they are.
- But... in this weather, sir?
- I know.
If it's any help to you,
I still honestly believe...
...there's a chance of their being picked up.
Yes. Thank you, sir.
Here.
Let me help you.
Is he going to die, sir?
Do you think he'll be all right?
I hope so.
Must be...
...nearly midday.
He's a nice fellow, Harding.
You like him, don't you?
He'd so the same for me.
It's...
...just the way he is.
The way... he talks, the bloke.
We've been together nearly two years, sir.
Others have... have come and gone.
But... we seem to have stuck,
I don't know why.
Yes, I know how it is.
His dad's got big estates.
Biggest there are in town.
My father's got fruiters and grocers.
In Luton.
It's mine now.
It's time for his water-foolish son...
...to get back to the shop.
I've got an old bloke looking after it but...
...he doesn't care.
No, it's not the same when it's not your own.
- Did you say Luton?
- Eh?
- Luton.
- Yes, do you know it?
That's funny...
You know, you must know my dad.
Why, did you live there, sir?
What is he, the mayor or something?
No, not exactly.
But he must have punched your ticket at the railway station often enough.
He's a porter there. Or he was, till two years ago when he retired.
Oh.
I used to be mad about trains when I was a kid.
Playing about the railway line all the time...
...watching the numbers of the trains and so on.
But Dad always said no. Fly.
Flying is the thing of the future.
Well, I dropped into the RAF but they wouldn't let me fly.
Eye sight test, you know.
Well, well, I was lucky.
I got a scholarship.
I... I'm an engineer, you know.
Yes... I got back into the RAF again in the end. They wanted me.
Some use to them, I suppose.
So... here I am.
I'll put in for my commission.
Do you think I'll get it?
I don't see why not.
You would, if you knew.
Why?
It's a bit soft telling this to an Air Commodore but...
I pinched a Jerry can of petrol...
...the night before we started out on this lot, and it landed in a ditch.
I've got a little car I bought off a bloke, you know... to go down see the shop now and again.
I just slung it in the back.
If anybody's found it...
I've had it.
If that shop goes bust...
I'm finished.
Yes.
This damn weather, this trouble at home, and you can't get back.
By the way, you'd better consider yourself under close arrest.
Oh...
You know...
He always thought...
...that he'd come and get his groceries from me...
...even if he had to cycle from Gloucestershire.
That's where he lives.
He will, Mac.
So help me, bud, he will.
Where do you think we are now, Kirby?
Somewhere off the coast of Belgium,
I reckon, sir.
There's a chance we may be washed up on...
...enemy territory then.
Well, at least he'd be safe and warm in hospital.
How's your hand, Mac?
Can't even feel it, sir.
That reminds me.
Time we had another ration.
See if you can reach that thing and...
...chuck it over, will you?
If I can.
With the other hand.
Thanks.
Do you think that...
...Sea Otter will...
...ever come back again?
Not exactly flying weather, is it?
Not ideal.
What about the air-sea rescue?
As my old grandma used to say...
Patient, ever patient, enjoy, so be thy share.
- Got it?
- Thank you, sir.
Oh, God!
I hate the bloody sea!
Is that the dinghy?
According to the Navy, yes, sir.
They've questioned that German pilot they brought in pretty closely, and allowing for wind and the tide, that's about it, sir.
- As close in as that.
- As close in as that.
If she's still afloat.
The Navy says she'll be right by the beach this evening...
...in occupied territory.
- Are both our launches still out of it?
- Yes, sir.
2559 is due at any time now with the Sea Otter.
2561 I reckon will be able to operate in a couple of hours.
Look!
Look what's happened to my best jacket.
Look at it! Look what's happened to my best jacket.
- Look what's happened.
- Good!
Nothing like a spot of oil for a two-bit, Skinner.
You'll have to get it off.
Got to wash it, like I do.
Maybe it'll keep you in at nights.
Go on, keep firing.
- What are you doing, bosseye?
- Yes, Flight.
The big swan wants his head examined.
How long is this likely to last?
Robbie seems to think we won't get the full force of the gale.
We're somewhere on the edge of it.
What do you think, Timmy?
Maybe I should have walloped her, given her what for, showed her who was boss.
No, that good-for-no-good, she'd just gone off sooner, wouldn't she, eh?
Well, what do you think, Gusser?
I'll tell you what I think, chum.
Somewhere out there there's four blokes in a dinghy.
They've been out there all night.
And if they're not dead already, they're sitting out there depending upon you and me to go and find them.
So if you don't stop whining about that silly wife of yours,
I'm gonna pick you up and chuck you right over the side, personally.
All right, all right, I was only asking.
Come on, it's time you and I go on watch.
Milliken, put the kettle on.
Robbins will be down in a minute, he'll want a cup of tea.
Okay, corporal, Tobey's in the way.
He asked for Flight.
Okay.
Do you think we'll be back before dark, Flight?
What's the matter? Can't you sleep without a night light?
What about the skipper?
- Going to Gosport.
- Yes...
Ever been to Gosport?
- No.
- I have.
I was stationed there in the old days.
Yeah, we've gone a long way since then.
And what have we got?
We've got radar, wireless, loops, launches with vast engines and patent logs.
With that and a fishing crew you're up a well-known creek.
Excuse me. I think I've set the boat on fire.
Fire!
Get down below!
It's all over here, sir.
- Where is he?
- Check the upper deck, the cabin.
- Aye, aye, sir.
- This is a fine bloody mess.
Who's responsible for this?
I am, sir.
Flt. Sgt., I want the full facts before we get back.
Milliken...
They'll probably shoot you for this.
But I was only trying to put the kettle on for a cup of tea.
If they don't shoot you, you'll be paying for this boat for the rest of your life.
Keep out of my way till we get back.
Now get up top.
You're doing bridge watch.
- Bridge watch, what's that?
- Keeping your silly eyes open, that's all.
You keep sitting on your old mat all day. Go, get up there!
Tobey, you follow him.
- Don't take your eyes off him.
- Okay, Flight.
- Well done, Tebbit.
- Thanks, very much.
- Clear this muck up.
- That's gonna take hours!
We've got all day!
I shouldn't have cared if we all blowed up.
What have I got to live for?
Hey! Come on, Guy Fawkes.
- How are you feeling now?
- Like death.
Why don't you sit in the wheel house?
I'll stand your watch for you.
Thanks, Corp, but I think I'd better stay here.
I'm not very popular with the Flight
Sergeant at the moment.
All I did was put a match to it and it blew up in my face.
Oh, forget it.
I know it was an accident.
The Flt. Sgt. doesn't think so.
- He's a bit of a terror, isn't he?
- He's gotta be.
After all, the Flight Sergeant's got to be tough.
He's all right.
You watch him if you run into any trouble. You'll see.
Hey, skipper.
Kraut firing ahead!
Launches.
Yeah.
And more than one by the sound of it.
I heard them.
And the firing, too.
You'll get a bloody medal, you will.
- They're due east of us, sir.
- And they're not HSLs.
You bet your life they're not.
They're right in the middle of eboat tally here.
I suppose they couldn't be
Navy boats, could they?
Yeah, they could.
But not our Navy.
The enemy.
I hope they don't run into us before
Skinner gets his engines going again.
We've got to make this pick-up.
All right, you bunch of heroes, get back to your holes... we're not dead yet.
Did you hear that?
There's firing.
Canada!
Canada! They've come, they've come!
Hold...
Hold the flare, Mac.
Let's see them first.
They might be Jerries.
Why should they be?
They must be ours.
They must.
Hear that?
But they... they must be our chaps.
They must...
Testing their guns around here?
No, they're Jerries all right.
That means we must have drifted south faster than we expected.
Yes, sir.
My guess is we're... we're somewhere off the mouth of the Scheldt.
How far off, do you think?
Well, unless... the wind changes...
...or the tide...
...we'll be inshore before nightfall.
Right under the nose of their shore batteries.
That washes out any chance of a rescue.
- There they are.
- Where?
There.
Two of them, see?
I... I knew it.
They're Jerries.
- What do we do now, sir?
- Wait.
Wait?
We're not going to give up ourselves now.
We'll be on the beach by nightfall.
You said so.
And Skipper... it'll be too late.
They may not have seen us yet.
There's still a chance of a rescue.
What's so good of being rescued if he's dead?
He's had as much as he can take.
We all have.
Haven't you got any pity?
Look at him.
He's dying, I tell you!
He's dying!
I've got to get this case back to England even if we all die.
There's just a chance they may be looking for us.
- For us, sir?
- Or this case.
They've passed us by.
No!
What are you up to, man?
For God's sake, man, what are you doing?
MacKay, MacKay, let go.
Give me that!
Give it!
- I'm gonna do it!
I'm gonna...
- It's time. It's time!
- MacKay, listen to me!
Millions of lives are... Listen!
There are millions of lives that we can save...
...if I can only get this case of mine back home.
Come on, Mac.
For God's sake, believe me, man.
He's right, you know, Mac.
Excuse me, sir.
You'll excuse me speaking to you, you're Group Commander Todd, aren't you?
- Yes.
- I've seen you at the dances.
- Oh, I'm uh...
- I'm Mrs. Tebbitt.
Oh, Mrs. Tebbitt.
- Yes.
My husband was due back from patrol last night and he hasn't turned up.
- What launch is he in?
Are you planning to catch this train?
Yes.
Yes, I am. I'm going to London.
- At least I...
- Mrs. Tebbitt.
There are four men down in a dinghy.
They're somewhere in the North Sea.
About their only chance now is for launch 2561 to find them.
Oh.
Excuse me. I've got to break the news to someone.
- Hello, Chris, dear.
- Hello, Eve.
How nice of you to come and meet me.
- Where's Clive?
- He's not here. Eve.
Don't tell me I've come all this way...
What is it, Chris?
Has something happened?
I'm afraid Clive's missing, Eve.
The aircraft he was traveling back in yesterday morning failed to arrive.
There's a crew of three with him.
We believe they're in a dinghy.
Dinghy?
Message from headquarters, sir.
Must be highly secret. I can't decode it.
Flight.
Aye, aye.
- Congratulations, sir.
- Thanks, Flight.
I told you that coat would fit a boy.
- Any reply, sir.
- Yes, send a signal.
When do the new childs allow us to start?
When do the new childs allow us to start?
I hope we get back soon, Flight.
It's gone 2 o'clock. That's me lot.
She's left me.
Here... you don't have it, you know.
Well, I did.
She's on her way to London by now.
I shall never see her again.
And a damn good job, too,
'cause I'm jolly well sick of her.
- Where's the captain.
- On the bridge with Chiefy.
- Well, they're all right. We can start.
- The engines are okay?
- I said we can start.
- Right.
- Engines are ready, sir.
- Good, and about time, too.
All right, start them up.
Marshall, send the signal to base.
- We're ready to continue the search.
- Very good, sir.
Blythe, go ahead all speed,
1000 revs.
Come in.
Well, Scotty, what is it this time?
- I thought you'd want to see this, sir.
- What is it?
It's a charge sheet made out against Flt. Sgt. MacKay.
- You haven't wasted much time.
- No, sir.
- Any news of the dinghy?
- No, there isn't.
Did all you could do, sir.
I suppose this will have to go through.
But if he comes ashore alive, he will be dealt with lightly, or I'll know the reason why.
Yes, sir. Still it's jolly unpatriotic, you know. I mean, pinching petrol...
- Don't behave like a club man!
- Yes, sir... Very good.
- Oh, one thing more.
- Yes, sir?
This little WAF, Sgt. Kirby's,
I gather you told her last night...
- ...he was safe and on his way back.
- I was trying to cheer her up.
She's only a child, you know.
She didn't behave like a child when I told her the facts.
Sorry, sir.
I seem to make rather a muck of things all around.
Come in.
Signal from 2561, sir.
- They're ready to resume the search.
- Right, I'll come.
- May I talk to you of the dance on Sunday, sir?
- No.
- Oh, no news yet, I'm afraid.
- Thank you, sir.
Where do you reckon the dinghy should be now?
Just about here, sir.
- Right in close to enemy shore.
- Forecast for that area is mist lifting rapidly.
It means the Jerries are bound to spot them.
Yes...
How long would it take 2561 to get to that position?
About an hour, sir.
45 minutes, maybe.
Right. Signal them to make an in-shore search in that area.
Yes, sir.
It's a devil of a place for a launch to go right out to the shore batteries.
- That is not all of it, sir.
- Hm? What else?
This is an enemy mine field.
I think it's about time we did some exercises again, huh?
- Land!
- Where?
- I saw land.
- Huh?
I saw land over there.
- Look, there it is.
- Where?
- See it?
- Yes, I can see it now that the mist is lifting.
Houses.
Real houses.
Well... we're close in.
Belgian coast.
South of Antwerp.
That'll be nice.
Right in Jerry's lap.
Listen!
It's only waves.
No, it sounded louder than that.
It's a sand bank.
We're inside it.
If it dries out at low tide... they'll be able to walk out and pick us up.
At least you'll be all right.
All I've got to look forward to is a court martial.
If we can get this briefcase back to England safely... you'll find it'll weigh more than a Jerry can of petrol.
Well, if anyone wants to pick us up now...
...they'll have plenty of fun.
- Will you make us some tea, Knox?
- Tea? Hot-water bottles in case of shock.
- Oughtn't I to do that?
- You did enough damage last time.
You get up on deck and keep your eyes open.
The shore's only over there through the mist.
We've got just about enough petrol to get us out.
Keep searching.
Aye, sir.
Thank goodness for this mist.
At least they can't see us from the shore.
A launch.
- A launch, they've found us.
- Where, man, where?
Over there.
I saw it for a second, then...
Then it disappeared.
- It's nothing.
- I tell you I saw a launch.
Air-sea rescuer, or I'm crazy.
Get the flare out, will you?
Make sure that it works this time.
Come on, where is it?
There!
There she is.
- Shout!
- Hey!
- For God's sake, shout!
- Hey! Hey!
It's no good attracting mensches at that distance
Get the flare out, Mac, go on!
Hey...Hey...
- I can't. You... you do...
The whistle!
Blow the whistle, Mac.
The mist is lifting.
It's a bit disappointing though, coming all this way without making the pick-up.
Blarmey, Tebbitt, you're human after all.
Thanks very much, Flight.
Flare, Flare!
Flight, a red flare.
Sir, a red flare over there!
That's all, hold it.
- There she is, sir!
- It's a dinghy, sir! It's a dinghy!
Stand by to pick-up!
On posts! Keep your eyes keen everybody.
The shore's somewhere over there.
Come on, get below, Milliken.
You've got work to do, come on.
She's coming.
She's coming towards us.
Shout, boys.
Shout like hell.
Hey! Hey!
- Hey!
- Hey!
We go uptide to the south side of the sand bank and come out the other end.
Aye, aye, sir.
Skinner, up on deck!
Let's have all of you up on deck!
We may need you.
Full speed ahead on all three.
- They've seen us, Flight!
- Here it comes!
Pretty rotten shots, aren't they?
Any menace they all start up.
One more like that, that's all we want, just one more like that.
Come on, hurry up!
Get a move on.
All together!
Right, lift!
Steady as you go!
- Are you all right, sir?
Don't worry about me, watch the dinghy.
We've got do this damn quickly.
Take the wheel.
You'll be all right, chums.
You'll be on board a train in a minute.
- Hey, Tebbitt!
- All right, sir.
Try to get a move on.
- I got it. Watch out chap.
- Okay, get her away!
Head off!
Hold your breath, boy!
We did it!
We bloody well did it!
Tebbitt!
- You all right?
- They must have chucked the gun at me.
- I'll get you an order to sick bay.
- And an all clear, Flight.
All clear?
Do you hear that noise?
The sweetest music in the world.
The engines making for home.
How are you, Clive?
- Hello, Chris.
- It's good to see you.
Good luck, sir.
- Thanks. Come see me later.
- I will, sir.
Okay, now?
Yes.
You?
Fine.
See you later.
Thank you, Treherne.
You did a great job.
The doctor said you'll be on your feet in a matter of weeks.
That'll suit me fine, sir.
Have a nice stretch of convalescence leave.
Give you time to get to know your son.
I'd like that, sir.
Congratulations.
Thank you all very much.
Thank you, sir.
- Well, how do you feel?
- Oh, I'll be fine in a couple of days.
I'm glad Eve took it so well.
Oh, by the way, I wanted to talk to you sometime about that Flt. Sgt. MacKay.
Funny you should mention that.
I wanted to talk to you about him.
How's Flight Officer Harding?
Oh, he'll be okay, Sergeant.
We got him just in time.
- How was it?
- Oh, a bit dodgy.
But we held them off, you know?
Here, Milliken!
A fag?
Oh, thanks, Flight.
I thought you did a favor to us all.
You made a pick-up.
You're one of God's chosen few.
Enjoy the trip?
I never thought we'd get back.
Get back? Get back?
After a pick up like that I'd have swum under the basket and carried her home.
I bet you would, Flight.
Now come on, son, don't keep the ambulance waiting. You're wounded, aren't you?
Oh, it's nothing. I feel a bit hungry.
I thought I'd go down to the cookhouse.
All them WAFs!
Come on, Robbie.

"The Two Turtles"
Here's the greatest toreador in all Spain.
Serve him a bottle of my best wine.
Sit down, please.
Vincente.
- Go and release a bull into the arena.
- Now?
Yes, immediately!
You are crazy, señor.
Don't answer back, do what I ask you.
How?
- Have you prepared tomorrow's bullfight?
- Yes.
So choose the best bull.
What does the card say?
What do you read?
Answer, Mother, I ask you.
What destiny do you predict?
Yes, I suspect, I know it.
Too much obsession with the one who is dead and dishonor in the profession of your son.
You answer now?
It is not necessary to be popular, it's enough to be a man.
The profession of toreador was worthy enough for my father.
But you are not like him.
Enough! Enough comparisons!
I'm not like him, but you can thank God for that!
He was a poor wretch!
Don't talk like that!
You deny your race.
I curse it!
Forgive me, Mother.
I have nothing to forgive you for, Juanito.
Good luck!
Good luck, Matador!
For the lady.
I dedicate the death of this bull to Pandora.
I want to offer a show as great as my love for you and as beautiful as your face.
Knowing your eyes watch me I will fight like no one has before me.
I dance for Pandora!
Dancing for you!
He is alive!
He's here!
But I killed him!
He is alive!
Leave me alone!
Even if you accept the belief that the high Trendex means a rising sales curve...
- Mr. Thornhill.
- Good night.
- Say hello to the missus.
- We're not talking.
My recommendation is still the same.
Spread the good word in as many small-time segments as we can.
Let the opposition have their high ratings while we cry all the way to the bank.
Why don't we colonize at the Colony next week?
Let me hear from you, Sam.
Uh, happy thoughts, et cetera.
You better walk me to the Plaza.
I didn't put a coat on.
- Use your blood sugar, child. Come on.
- Next?
- Gretchen Sabinson.
Oh, yes. Send her a box of candy from Blum's, $10. You know the kind.
Each piece wrapped in gold paper.
She'll like that.
She'll think she's eating money.
Just say to her:
"Darling, I count the days, the hours... "
- You sent that one last time.
- I did?
Well, put: "Something for your sweet tooth, baby, and all your other sweet parts. "
- I know.
- Could we take a cab, Mr. Thornhill?
- For two blocks?
- You're late and I'm tired.
That's your trouble, Maggie, you don't eat properly.
Here. Taxi.
I have a very sick woman here.
You don't mind, do you?
- Well, no.
Thank you very much.
Perfectly all right.
- First stop, the Plaza. Don't throw the flag.
- Poor man.
Oh, come, come, come.
I made him a happy man.
- I made him feel like a good Samaritan.
- He knew you were lying.
Ah, in the world of advertising, there's no such thing as a lie.
There's only the expedient exaggeration.
You ought to know that.
- Say, do I look heavyish to you?
- What?
I feel heavyish.
Put a note on my desk in the morning:
"Think thin. "
"Think thin. "
- Better make it the 59th Street entrance.
- Okay.
Oh. Soon as you get back, call my mother.
Remind her we've got those theater tickets for tonight.
Dinner at 21, 7:00.
I'll have had two martinis at the Oak Bar, so she needn't bother to sniff my breath.
- She doesn't do that.
- Sure she does. Like a bloodhound.
Bigelow at 10:30 is your first tomorrow, the Skin Glow rehearsal at noon...
...then lunch with Falcon and his wife.
- Oh, yeah. Where was that?
- Larry and Arnold's, 1:00.
- Oh.
- Will you check in later?
Absolutely not.
Here, driver, take this lady back where she belongs.
- Right.
- That ought to cover it.
- Don't forget, call my mother right away.
- I won't.
- Good night, Mr. Thornhill.
- Good night, sweetie.
Oh, wait, Maggie. You can't call her.
She's at Mrs...
- Good evening.
Good evening.
I'm looking for Mr. Weltner and two other gentlemen.
Yes, sir. Right this way.
Herman.
- Roger.
- I'm a little late.
- Roger Thornhill.
- Fanning Nelson.
- How do you do?
- How do you do?
- Larry Wade.
- We got a little head start here.
- Oh, that won't last long.
I was telling Larry and Fanning you may be slow on starting but there's nobody faster.
- What's the matter? You've got the fidgets.
- I just did something stupid.
I told my secretary to call Mother.
I realized she won't be able to reach her.
Why not?
- She's playing bridge at one of her cronies'.
- Your secretary?
- No. My mother.
One of those new apartments.
Wet paint and no telephone yet.
George Kaplan.
- Perhaps if I send her a telegram.
- Mr. George Kaplan?
Boy.
- Kaplan.
- I've got to get off a wire immediately.
Could you send it for me if I write it out for you?
Oh, I'm not permitted to do that, sir, but if you'll follow me.
- Oh. Will you excuse me, gentlemen?
- Go right ahead.
- Right through there, sir.
- Yeah, thanks.
Thank you, sir.
Wait, what's that supposed to be?
The car's waiting outside.
You will walk between us saying nothing.
- What are you talking about?
- Let's go.
Let's go where? Who...? Who are you?
Mere errand boys carrying concealed weapons.
His is pointed at your heart. So, please, no errors of judgment, I beg of you.
What is this, a joke or something?
- Yes, a joke. We will laugh in the car.
- Come.
But this is ridiculous.
Don't tell me where we're going, surprise me.
You know, I left some friends back there in the Oak Bar.
They're going to think I'm awfully rude.
I mean, uh, couldn't we stop off at a drugstore for a moment...
...so that I could explain
I'm being, uh, kidnapped?
Well, that is what's happening, isn't it?
Locked.
Who's Townsend?
Really?
Interesting.
- Where is he?
- Upstairs, dressing.
- Tell him I'm here.
- The dinner guests are expected.
Never mind that. Say to him: "Kaplan. "
By the way, what are we having for dessert?
- Is anyone in the library?
- No.
This way.
You will wait here.
Well, don't hurry.
I'll catch up on my reading.
Good evening.
Not what I expected. A little taller.
A little more polished than the others.
Oh, I'm so glad you're pleased,
Mr. Townsend.
But I'm afraid just as obvious.
What the devil is all this about?
Why was I brought here?
Games? Must we?
Not that I mind a case of abduction...
...but I have tickets for the theater this evening.
To a show I was looking forward to. And I get unreasonable about things like that.
With such expert play-acting, you make this very room a theater.
Oh, Leonard, have you met our distinguished guest?
He's a well-tailored one, isn't he?
My secretary is a great admirer of your methods, Mr. Kaplan.
- Elusiveness, however misguided...
- Wait a minute. Wait, wait.
- Did you call me "Kaplan"?
- I know you're a man of many names...
...but I'm perfectly willing to accept your current choice.
Current choice?
My name is Thornhill. Roger Thornhill.
It's never been anything else.
Of course.
Your friends picked up the wrong package when they bundled me out here in the car.
Do sit down, Mr. Kaplan.
I told you, I'm not Kaplan, whoever he is. I'm...
- Excuse me.
Yes?
The guests are here, dear.
Look after them.
I'll be with you in a few minutes.
Now, shall we get down to business?
I'm all for that.
Simply, I'd like you to tell me how much you know of our arrangements...
...and how you've come by this information.
- I don't expect to get this for nothing.
- Of course not.
Don't misunderstand, I don't expect you to fall in with this suggestion...
...but the least I can do is afford you the opportunity of surviving the evening.
What the devil is that supposed to mean?
Why don't you surprise me,
Mr. Kaplan, and say yes?
I've already told you...
- We know where you're headed for.
I know where I'm headed.
I'm headed for the Winter Garden Theater in
New York, and I think I'd better get going.
Townsend, you're making a serious mistake.
This is not going to lead to a very happy conclusion, Mr. Kaplan.
I'm not Kaplan.
- I do wish you'd reconsider.
We also know your contact in Pittsburgh since Jason committed suicide.
What contact?
I've never even been in Pittsburgh.
On June the 16th, you checked into the Sherwyn Hotel in Pittsburgh...
...as Mr. George Kaplan of Berkeley, California.
A week later, you registered at the Benjamin Franklin Hotel...
...as Mr. George Kaplan of Pittsburgh.
On August 11th, you stayed at the Statler in Boston.
August the 29th, George Kaplan of Boston registered at the Whittier in Detroit.
At present, you are registered in room 796...
...at the Plaza Hotel in New York as Mr. George Kaplan of Detroit.
- Really?
- In two days...
...you are due at the Ambassador East in Chicago.
And then at the Sheraton-Johnson Hotel in Rapid City, South Dakota.
- Not me.
- There's very little sense...
...in maintaining that you're deceiving us any more than we're deceiving you.
I don't suppose it would do any good to show you ID cards...
...a driver's license, things like that?
- They provide you with such good ones.
It's getting late. I have guests.
Do you intend to cooperate with us?
I'd like a simple yes or no.
A simple no.
For the simple reason I simply don't know what you're talking about.
Give Mr. Kaplan a drink, Leonard.
A pleasant journey, sir.
- Scotch? Rye? Bourbon? Vodka?
- Nothing. I'll take a quick ride back to town.
Oh, that has been arranged.
But first, a libation.
Bourbon.
You drink it.
I've had enough stimulation for one day.
It'll be easier if you take this yourself.
Otherwise, it'll be necessary for us to insist.
Cheers.
Don't worry about me, fellas.
I'll take the bus.
Thanks for the lift, fellas.
I want this man examined for driving while intoxicated.
- Really?
- Yeah.
You see, they tried to kill me.
He won't listen to me.
In a big house, they tried to kill me.
- All right, let's just go inside.
- I don't wanna go inside.
- Somebody call the police.
- Come on. Come on now.
Okay.
Sit down.
I don't wanna sit.
Perfectly all right. See?
We'll get them. We'll throw the book at them. Assault and kidnapping.
Assault with a gun, and a bourbon, and a sports car. We'll get them.
You'll be all right after a good night's sleep.
We got a nice cell all made up.
- I don't want a cell. I want a policeman.
- The car was just reported stolen.
- Uh-huh.
- A Mrs. Babson up on Twining Road.
- I got to call someone. Where's the phone?
- You're allowed one call.
- Over here.
- Oh, thanks.
You better make it your lawyer.
Butterfield 8-1-0-9-8.
What am I, a telephone operator?
Butterfield 8-1-0-9-8.
Just a minute, please. Here.
Thank you.
Hello, Mother?
Mother, this is your son, Roger Thornhill.
Yeah.
Wait a minute, I'll find out.
- Where am I?
- Glen Cove Police Station.
Glen Cove Police Station.
No. No, Mother, I have not been drinking.
No. No, these two men, they poured a whole bottle of bourbon into me.
No, they didn't give me a chaser.
No.
Come on, let's go.
- Wait, I'm not finished yet.
- Yes, you are. Come on.
Mother, I gotta go now.
Get my lawyer right away, and come out and bail me out.
Tomorrow morning, tell her.
Tomorrow morning, he says.
I don't know. I'll ask him.
She wants to know who says.
Sergeant Emile Klinger.
Sergeant Emile...
Emile?
Sergeant Emile Klinger.
No, I didn't believe it either.
Uh, I'm all right, Mother. Good night.
Good night, dear.
That was Mother.
Let's go.
Here's your man, doctor.
- What's your name?
- Roger Thornhill.
Stick out your tongue and say "ah. "
You better move back.
Ah...
Have you been drinking?
Doctor, I am gassed.
What were you drinking?
Well, bourbon.
See, these two fellas, they...
- How much would you say you drank?
- What did you say?
- How much would you say that you drank?
- About this much.
Mr. Thornhill, it is my opinion that you are definitely intoxicated.
No question about it.
I am now gonna ask your permission to draw blood.
How disgusting.
"You may refuse to permit a blood test to be made...
...but if you do, your license will be revoked.
You have the right to notify a physician of... "
It was at this point that Mr. Thornhill succeeded in escaping...
...from his would-be assassins, and when they gave chase...
...he naturally had to drive as best he could under the, uh, circumstances.
Counselor, how long have you known your client?
Seven years, Your Honor.
Do you know him to be a reasonable man?
Absolutely.
- Ha.
- Mother.
And do you believe...
...there is some credence to this story?
- Credence?
- Well, yes, Your Honor.
I mean, if my client says this is what happened...
...I'm certain it must've happened.
- You're damn right.
Sergeant, I want this turned over to the county detectives for investigation.
Call them up and have them come here immediately.
- Right, Your Honor.
Counselor...
...I'm going to set this over for final disposition...
...tomorrow night at 7:30.
At which time I expect you and the defendant to be here, ready to go to trial.
In the meantime, the county detectives will determine if his story has any basis in fact.
"Basis in fact"? If I were brought in dead, you still wouldn't believe...
Roger, wait a minute.
I mean, after all, Your Honor, would I make up such a story?
That is precisely what we're intending to find out, Mr. Thornhill.
- Yes?
Remember me?
- Yes, sir.
Good.
- Is Mr. Townsend at home?
- No, I'm sorry he's left for the day, sir.
Mrs. Townsend?
- Who shall I say is calling?
- County detectives.
Come in, please.
This way, please.
This is the room.
- I'll call madam.
You do that.
And here's the sofa where they held me down.
They spilled bourbon all over it.
I'll show you the stains.
Well, they must've cleaned them off.
This is the cabinet where they keep the liquor.
Scotch, gin, vodka...
And bourbon.
I remember when it used to come in bottles.
Roger, dear, we were so worried about you.
Did you get home all right?
Of course you did.
Let me look at you.
Oh, a little pink-eyed, but aren't we all?
It was a dull party.
You didn't miss a thing.
I want you all to know,
I never saw this woman before last night.
I'm Captain Junket of the Nassau County Detectives.
- This is Lieutenant Harding.
- How do you do?
You haven't gotten into trouble, Roger?
- Stop calling me Roger.
- Has he gotten into trouble?
Mr. Thornhill was picked up last night driving under the influence of alcohol...
...and incidentally, in a stolen car.
- Stolen car?
Belonging to Mrs. Babson of Twining Road.
Roger, you said you were going to call a cab.
- You didn't borrow Laura's Mercedes?
- No, I didn't borrow Laura's Mercedes.
Mr. Thornhill told us that he was brought to this house against his will last night...
...and, uh, forcibly intoxicated by some friends of your husband...
...and set out on the road.
- Do you know anything about this?
- Well, now, captain...
...Roger was a bit tipsy when he arrived here by cab for dinner.
She's lying.
And I'm afraid he became even worse...
...as the evening wore on.
Finally, he told us he had to go home to sleep it off.
Oh, I knew
I should've served dinner earlier.
What a performance.
Mrs. Townsend, does the name
George Kaplan mean anything to you?
George Kaplan?
- No.
- I didn't think so.
Where's her husband?
He's the one you should be questioning.
- Is there any place he can be reached?
- Why, yes. The United Nations.
United Nat...?
He's addressing the General Assembly this afternoon.
All right. So he's addressing the General Assembly.
- Sorry we had to bother you.
- No bother at all.
Now, wait a minute.
Will you be wanting to get in touch with my husband?
No, Mrs. Townsend, that won't be necessary.
You mean you're not gonna do any more about this?
Roger. Pay the two dollars.
Goodbye.
- I don't see why you want me along.
- You lend a certain air of respectability.
Don't be sarcastic, Roger.
There you are, dear. Park yourself there.
Well, here goes. Ahem.
Hello, Operator. Have you got a George Kaplan staying here?
That's right.
You have?
Room 796?
Ring it, will you please?
You see?
I see. I hope he clears up this silly business.
- You're ruining my whole day.
- Shh, shh. All right. Quiet. Shut up.
Oh. Well, did he leave word when he'd be back?
Really?
Thank you.
Well, that's odd. He hasn't answered his telephone in two days.
Maybe he got locked in the bathroom.
Mother, do me a favor, will you?
Put on that innocent look you do so well and go to the desk and get the key to 796.
Don't be ridiculous.
I wouldn't do such a thing.
- Ten dollars?
- Not for all the money in the world.
- Fifty?
- Roger, you are disgraceful.
Car theft, drunk driving, assaulting an officer, lying to a judge.
And now, housebreaking.
You're hotel-breaking.
There's a difference.
- Of five to ten years.
Just a minute, please.
Will you want me to be changing your bedding, sir?
Yes. Well, but not right now.
I mention it, because the bed doesn't seem like it's been slept in...
...and I was wondering if I ought to go on changing the linens.
- Oh. Thank you for your interest.
- You're welcome, sir.
Come on, now.
Now, she seemed to think I'm Kaplan.
I wonder if I look like Kaplan.
- Oh, well, look who's here.
- Who? Where?
Our friend who's assembling the General Assembly this afternoon.
Roger, I think we should go.
- Don't be nervous.
- I'm not nervous.
- I'll be late for the bridge club.
- Good. You will lose less than usual.
Ooh.
- Bulletin, Kaplan has dandruff.
- In that case, I think we should leave.
Too late.
- You rang for me, sir?
- Yes. Come in a moment.
- What's your name?
- Elsie, sir.
- Elsie, do you know who I am?
- You're... You're Mr. Kaplan.
Well, when did...?
When did you first see me?
Outside the door.
Out in the hall, a couple of minutes ago.
Don't you remember?
And that's the first time you laid eyes on me?
Can I help it if you're never around,
Mr. Kaplan?
Well, then, how do you know
I am Mr. Kaplan?
- What?
- How do you know I'm Mr. Kaplan?
Well, of course you are.
This is room 796, isn't it?
So you're the gentleman in room 796, aren't you?
All right, Elsie, thanks.
- Will that be all, sir?
- For the time being, yes.
Valet.
Oh, yes, come in.
Should I hang it in the closet, Mr. Kaplan?
Yes, please.
Tell me, uh...
I forgot, what time did I give you that suit?
Last night, around, uh...
- Around 6.
- Oh.
- Did I give it to you personally?
- Personally?
No. You called down on the phone and described the suit to me...
...and said it would be hanging in your closet. Like you always do.
- Anything wrong?
- No, no, just curious.
- Here. Thanks.
- Thank you.
Nice to meet you, Mr. Kaplan.
Isn’t that the damnedest thing?
I'm beginning to think that no one in the hotel has actually seen Kaplan.
Maybe he has his suits mended by invisible weavers.
Oh...
Let me see something.
I don't think that one does anything for you.
Ah, now, that's much better.
Now, obviously they've mistaken me for a much shorter man.
- Should I?
- Certainly not.
Here, hold that, dear.
Hello.
It's good to find you in, Mr. Kaplan.
Who is this?
We met only last night, and still you do not recognize my voice.
I should feel offended.
Yes, I know who you are, and I'm not Mr. Kaplan.
Of course not. You answer his telephone, you live in his hotel room...
...and yet you are not Mr. Kaplan.
Nevertheless, we are pleased to find you in.
Now, wait...
- Hello, Operator? Operator.
Yes?
Operator, this is Mr. Thorn...
Kaplan in 796.
That call. Was that an outside call or did it come from the lobby?
Just a minute, sir. I'll see.
- Well, hurry, please.
Who was it?
One of the men who tried to kill me last night.
- We're back to that one, are we?
- Hello? Operator?
Mr. Kaplan?
- Yes.
That call was made from the lobby, sir.
It was?
They're probably on their way up here now.
- Come on. Let's get out of here.
- I think I'd like to meet these killers.
You gentlemen aren't really trying to kill my son, are you?
Lobby, please. Watch your step.
Oh, no, gentlemen, please. Ladies first.
Come along, ladies.
That's right. Come along. Good.
Roger. Roger, will you be home for dinner?
Where to?
- I don't know. Just keep going.
- Take me to the United Nations.
Right.
General Assembly Building.
Right.
- I'm being followed. Can you do anything?
- Yes, I can.
- Do it.
- May I help you, sir?
- Yes, please.
- Where will I find Mr. Lester Townsend?
- Mr. Lester Townsend of UNIPO?
- Yes.
- And did you have an appointment, sir?
Well, yes, yes. He expects me.
Your name, please.
- My name?
- Yes, please.
Kaplan. George Kaplan.
One moment, please.
Wait for me at the corner of 47th.
If you'll give this to one of the attendants in the public lounge, she'll page him.
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome, Mr. Kaplan.
Mr. Bernardi of the Swiss Observers Office.
Mr. Bernardi of the Swiss Observers Office.
Will you page
Mr. Lester Townsend, please?
Certainly, Mr. Kaplan.
Mr. Townsend of UNIPO.
Mr. Townsend of UNIPO.
Please call at the communications desk of the public lounge.
Mr. Townsend of UNIPO.
Please call at the communications desk of the public lounge.
Miss Knox of salon...
You paged me?
- Mr. Kaplan?
- Yes.
- You wanted to see Mr. Townsend.
- Yes.
- This is Mr. Townsend.
- How do you do, Mr. Kaplan?
- This isn't Mr. Townsend.
- Yes, it is.
There must be some mistake.
Mr. Lester Townsend?
That's me. What can I do for you?
Mr. Mauney, Delegation of Pakistan. Please call the public lounge.
Are you the Townsend who lives in Glen Cove?
That's right. Are we neighbors?
A large, red-brick house with a curved, tree-lined driveway?
That's the one.
Were you at home last night,
Mr. Townsend?
- You mean in Glen Cove?
- Yes.
I've been staying in my apartment in town for the last month.
I always do when we're in session here.
What about Mrs. Townsend?
My wife has been dead for many years.
- Oh, I...
- Now, Mr. Kaplan, what's this all about?
Forgive me. Who are those people living in your house?
What people?
The house is completely closed up.
Just the gardener and his wife living on the grounds.
Now, Mr. Kaplan, suppose you tell me who you are and what you want.
Well, please, just...
Look. Do you know this man?
Look!
He's got a knife. Look out!
Listen to me.
I had nothing to do with this.
Call the police.
- Wait a minute. Don't come nearer.
Get back.
"The photograph has been identified as that of Roger Thornhill...
...a Manhattan advertising executive, indicating that the name of George Kaplan...
...which he gave to an attendant in the
General Assembly Building was false.
A possible motive for the slaying was suggested by the discovery...
...that earlier today, Thornhill appeared at Glen Cove police court...
...charged with drunk driving with a stolen car.
In his defense, he charged that the murder victim, Mr. Townsend...
...had tried to kill him the night before. "
- Brother.
- What about that?
Does anyone know this Thornhill?
- No, not me.
- Never heard of him.
Professor?
Apparently, the poor sucker got mistaken for George Kaplan.
How can he get mistaken for
George Kaplan when he doesn't even exist?
Don't ask me how it happened.
Obviously, it happened.
Vandamm's men must have grabbed him and tried to put him away...
...using Lester Townsend's house.
The unsuspecting Mr. Townsend winds up with a stray knife in his back.
So horribly sad.
How is it I feel like laughing?
What are we going to do?
Do?
About Mr. Thornhill.
We, uh...
We do nothing.
- Nothing?
- That's right. Nothing.
Or we could congratulate ourselves on a marvelous stroke of good fortune.
Our non-existent decoy, George Kaplan, created to divert suspicion...
...from our actual agent, has fortuitously become a live decoy.
Yes, professor.
And how long do you think he'll stay live?
Well, that's his problem.
What Mrs. Finley means, is...
- Oh, I know what she means.
We can't sit back calmly and wait to see who kills him first.
Vandamm and company or the police.
What can we do to save him without endangering our own agent?
Aren't we being just a wee bit callous?
No, my dear woman, we're not being callous.
We didn't invent our nonexistent man and give him the name of George Kaplan...
...and establish elaborate behavior patterns for him...
...and move his prop belongings in and out of hotel rooms...
...for our own private amusement.
We created George Kaplan...
...and labored successfully to convince Vandamm...
...that this was our own agent hot on his trail for a desperately important reason.
Check.
- Nobody's denying that!
Very well, then.
If we make the slightest move to suggest there is no such agent as George Kaplan...
...give any hint to Vandamm that he's pursuing a decoy...
...instead of our own agent...
...then our agent, working right under Vandamm's very nose...
...will immediately face suspicion, exposure...
...and assassination.
Like the two others who went before.
Goodbye, Mr. Thornhill, wherever you are.
New York Central Railroad, train number 25...
...the 20th Century Limited...
...due to leave at 6 p. m. For Chicago...
...will depart from plank number 30.
- Yes. Yes, dear. I know.
Now, listen to me, Mother, I beg you.
I called the Plaza.
Kaplan checked out. He went to the hotel Ambassador East in Chicago.
Yes, that's why I'm...
Well, I can't go to the police.
At least not yet.
You saw the newspapers.
My fingerprints are on the knife...
...I'm a car thief, a drunk driver, and I murdered a man for revenge.
I wouldn't have a chance.
And I won't have, until I find George Kaplan who obviously knows what this is all about.
No, dear, the train. It's safer.
Well, because there's no place to hide on a plane if anyone should recognize me.
You want me to jump off a moving plane?
Yes. Well, thank you so much, Mother.
Yeah, well, goodbye.
Attention, please.
New York Central Railroad, train number 25...
...the 20th Century Limited...
...due to leave at 6 p. m.
Yeah.
Uh, give me a bedroom on the 20th Century, please.
It's leaving in five minutes.
- Yes, I know. Could you make it snappy?
- I think they're all sold out.
- Sold out?
You can always go coach.
No, I can't do that.
What time is the next train?
Nothing till 10. You're in a hurry, huh?
Well, could you call them and see what they have?
Something wrong with your eyes?
Yes, they're sensitive to questions.
Will you call them?
Sure. Sure.
Don't go away.
He's at Window 15, upper level. Hurry.
You're in luck, mister, you...
- Ticket?
- I'm just seeing some friends off.
Sorry, I have to know their names before I can let you through.
Come here! Hey, come here!
Oh.
- Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- My fault.
Sorry.
He went that way. I think he got off.
All aboard!
- Thank you.
- It's quite all right.
- Seven parking tickets.
- Oh.
Good evening, sir. One?
- Please.
Cocktail before dinner?
- Yes, please. A Gibson.
Right away.
- Well, here we are again.
- Yes.
- Do you recommend anything?
- The brook trout.
A little trouty, but quite good.
Sold.
Brook trout.
- There you are. Thank you.
Yes, sir.
- I know. I look vaguely familiar.
- Yes.
You feel you've seen me somewhere before.
Funny how I have that effect on people.
It's something about my face.
It's a nice face.
- You think so?
- I wouldn't say it if I didn't.
Oh, you're that type.
- What type?
Honest.
Not really.
- Good. Because honest women frighten me.
Why?
I don't know. Somehow, they seem to put me at a disadvantage.
- Because you're not honest with them?
Exactly.
Like that business about the seven parking tickets?
Well, what I mean is, the moment I meet an attractive woman...
...I have to start pretending
I've no desire to make love to her.
What makes you think you have to conceal it?
She might find the idea objectionable.
Then again, she might not.
Think how lucky I am to have been seated here.
Oh, luck had nothing to do with it.
Fate?
I tipped the steward $5 to seat you here if you should come in.
Is that a proposition?
I never discuss love on an empty stomach.
You've already eaten.
But you haven't.
Don't you think it's time we were introduced?
I'm Eve Kendall. I'm 26 and unmarried.
Now you know everything.
Tell me. What do you do besides lure men to their doom on the 20th Century Limited?
I'm an industrial designer.
Jack Phillips. Western sales manager for Kingby Electronics.
No, you're not.
You're Roger Thornhill of Madison Avenue...
...and you're wanted for murder on every front page in America.
And don't be so modest.
Whoops.
Oh, don't worry.
- I won't say a word.
- How come?
I told you.
It's a nice face.
Is that the only reason?
It's going to be a long night.
True.
And I don't particularly like the book
I've started.
You know what I mean?
Let me think.
Yes, I know exactly what you mean.
There's my trademark. R.O.T.
Roger O. Thornhill.
What does the "O" stand for?
Nothing.
I'd invite you to my bedroom if I had a bedroom.
- A roomette?
- Nothing, not even a ticket.
I've been playing hide-and-seek ever since the train left New York.
- How awkward for you.
- Yes, isn't it?
No place to sleep.
I have a large drawing room all to myself.
That doesn't seem quite fair, does it?
Drawing room E.
Car 3901.
Such a nice number.
It's easy to remember.
Thirty-nine-oh-one.
See?
No luggage.
- So?
- Well, you wouldn't happen...
...to have an extra pair of pajamas, would you?
Wouldn't I?
Incidentally, I wouldn't order any dessert if I were you.
I get the message.
That isn't exactly what I meant.
This train seems to be making an unscheduled stop.
And I just saw two men get out of a police car as we pulled into the station.
They weren't smiling.
I think you better go out and tell those police to hurry.
Patience is a virtue.
So is breathing.
Just lie still.
Have you got any olive oil?
Olive oil?
I want to be packed in olive oil if I'm gonna be a sardine.
Come in.
- Who are you?
- State police.
Your name please?
Eve Kendall. Is anything wrong?
There was a man at your table tonight in the dining car.
- Yes.
Friend of yours?
I never saw him before.
Is this the man?
Yes, I think so.
It's not a very clear picture.
It's a Wirephoto.
We just got it from the New York police.
- Police?
- He's wanted for murder.
Good heavens, no.
The steward said you left the dining car together.
We might have happened to leave at the same time, but not together.
What did you two talk about?
Talk about?
Your waiter said you were getting along good with this Thornhill.
Is that his name? Thornhill?
You mean, he didn't tell you?
He didn't tell me anything.
All we did was chat about different kinds of food...
...train travel versus plane travel, that sort of thing.
Rather innocuous, I must say, considering he was a fugitive from justice.
- Who did he kill?
- He didn't say where he was going, did he?
No. I assumed Chicago.
You think perhaps he got off when you got on?
If you happen to catch sight of him again, Miss, uh...
Kendall.
Will you let us know?
I'm going to bed and I intend to lock my door.
So I doubt if I'll seeing anybody else tonight.
Well, just in case you do, we'll be in the observation car at the rear of the train.
It's comforting to know that.
Good night.
Still breathing?
Either hurry up or get me a snorkel.
I'm looking for the can opener
I stole from the porter.
Hello, there.
Hello.
Hmm.
Tell me, why are you so good to me?
Shall I climb up and tell you why?
You know, I've been thinking, it's not safe for you...
...to roam around Chicago looking for this George Kaplan man...
...you've been telling me about.
You'll be picked up by the police the moment you show your face.
Such a nice face too.
Now, don't you think it would be a better idea if you stayed in my hotel room...
...while I located him for you and brought him to you?
I can't let you get involved.
It's too dangerous.
I'm a big girl.
Yeah, and in all the right places too.
You know, this is ridiculous.
You know that, don't you?
Yes.
I mean, we've hardly met.
That's right.
How do I know you aren't a murderer?
You don't.
Maybe you're planning to murder me, right here, tonight.
Shall I?
Please do.
Beats flying, doesn't it?
We should stop.
Immediately.
I ought to know more about you.
What more could you know?
You're an advertising man, that's all I know.
That's right.
Train's a little unsteady.
Who isn't?
What else do you know?
You've got taste in clothes, taste in food...
And taste in women. I like your flavor.
You're very clever with words.
You can probably make them do anything for you.
Sell people things they don't need...
...make women who don't know you fall in love with you.
I'm beginning to think I'm underpaid.
Look out.
Oh, porter.
- Don't bother with the washroom.
- Yes, ma'am.
By the way, I found this on the floor.
Does it belong to you?
Yes, ma'am.
I've been looking all over for it.
- I'll wait outside.
- Thank you.
Thank you, porter.
Thank you, ma'am. Good night, now.
Good night.
Come out, come out, wherever you are.
The porter.
So I see.
Now...
...where were we?
- Here.
Oh, yes.
- Nice of him to have opened the bed.
- Yes.
- Only one bed.
- Yes.
That's a good omen, don't you think?
Wonderful.
Do you know what that means?
What? Tell me.
It means you're going to sleep on the floor.
A message from the lady in 3901.
- You keep walking. I'll catch up.
- Yes, ma'am.
- Anything to report, Miss Kendall?
- Why, yes. I had a fine night's sleep.
No, I mean, have you seen the man we're looking for?
- Mr. Thornycroft?
- Thornhill.
No, no. I'm awfully sorry.
But good luck to you both.
- How are we doing?
- Oh, I may collapse at any moment.
Not yet.
First we have to run the gauntlet. Look.
Hmm?
I'm accustomed to having a load on, but what have you got in these bags?
- Bowling balls, naturally.
- Oh, naturally.
- Which one of these has my suit in it?
- The small one underneath your right arm.
Oh, thanks. That ought to do the suit a lot of good.
I'm sure Mr. Kaplan won't mind a few wrinkles.
Yeah, if he's still there. What time is it?
Nine-ten.
Nine-ten? Well, he may have left his hotel room by now.
I'll call him for you as soon as we get inside the station.
No thank you, I can do it.
A redcap in a phone booth?
Slightly suspicious.
I, uh... Well, all right. What are you gonna tell him? Do you know that?
Mm-hm. You want to see him right away.
Terribly urgent. Matter of life and death.
- Mm-hm. Right.
- No explanations.
While I'm calling, you can change your clothes.
Where do you propose I do that?
In Marshall Field's window?
I sort of had the men's room in mind.
Did you, now?
You're the smartest girl
I ever spent the night with on a train.
I think we made it.
Where did he go?
- Which way did he go?
- Where did he go?
I don't know. He took my clothes.
And went that way.
Come on.
Departing at 10 a. m.,
Chicago daylight time...
...for Michigan City.
Now ready on track number six.
Well, what took you so long?
Well, I have a big face, small razor.
Tell me, did you get Kaplan?
- Yes.
- Fine. What did he say?
Well, he'll see you, but not at the hotel under any circumstances.
- He'll see you on the outside.
- Well, where? When?
- I've got it all written down for you.
- Thanks.
Take the Greyhound bus that leaves Chicago...
...for Indianapolis at 2 and ask the driver to let you off at Prairie Stop, Highway 41.
Prairie Stop, Highway 41. Good.
It's about an hour-and-a-half's drive from Chicago.
Fine. I'll rent a car.
No car. Mr. Kaplan said bus.
He wants to be sure you're alone.
All right. What'll I do when I get there?
Just wait beside the road.
He'll be there at 3:30.
- Well, how will I know him?
- He'll know you.
- You made the Chicago papers too.
- Oh, yes.
Have you got your watch set for Central time?
Yes, I did that. Thanks.
- What's the matter?
- Matter?
Yes, you seem... I don't know.
You seem tense.
You know, you better go before the police run out of redcaps.
We'll see each other again, won't we?
Sometime, I'm sure.
I never had a moment to thank you properly.
Please go.
- Yes, but... But where will I find you?
I've gotta pick up my bags now.
Oh, yes. Well, these are the checks for the large cases.
Wait a minute.
Please.
They're coming.
Hi.
- Hot day.
- Seen worse.
Are you supposed to be meeting someone here?
- Waiting for the bus. Due any minute.
- Oh.
Some of them crop-duster pilots get rich, if they live long enough.
Yeah.
And, uh, then your name isn't Kaplan?
Can't say it is, because it ain't.
Here she comes. Right on time.
- That's funny.
- What?
That plane's dusting crops where there ain't no crops.
Get out of here!
The other tank may blow!
What happened?
Hey!
Come back! Hey!
Come back! Come back! Hey!
- Yes?
- Uh...
Could you let me have
Mr. George Kaplan's room number, please?
- Kaplan?
- Yeah.
I think he checked out.
- He checked out?
- That's right.
He checked out at 7:10 this morning.
- Seven-ten? Are you sure?
- Yes. He left a forwarding address.
Hotel Sheraton-Johnson,
Rapid City, South Dakota.
Seven-ten?
Well, then how come I got a message from him at 9...?
What's that?
Nothing. Nothing.
Sorry to bother you again.
Miss Eve Kendall is expecting me.
She's in room four-something.
I've forgotten the number.
Would you mind?
- She's in 463.
- Oh, yes, that's right. Thanks.
Hello.
Surprised?
Yes.
No getting rid of me, is there?
I could use a drink.
- I have some Scotch.
- With water. No ice.
How did it go today?
The meeting with Kaplan?
He didn't show up.
Oh?
It's funny, isn't it?
Why funny?
Oh, after all those involved and explicit directions he gave you on the phone.
- Maybe I copied them down wrong.
- I don't think you got them wrong.
I think you sent me to the right place, all right.
Why don't you call him back again and see what happened?
I did. He checked out.
Went to South Dakota.
South Dakota?
Rapid City.
Well, what are you going to do next?
I haven't made my mind up yet.
It may depend on you.
- On me?
- Sure.
You're my little helper, aren't you?
Thank you. To us.
To a long and lasting friendship.
Meaning, from now on, I'm not going to let you out of my sight, sweetheart.
I'm afraid you'll have to.
- Oh, no.
- I do have plans of my own, you know?
And you do have problems.
Well, wouldn't it be nice if my problems and your plans were somehow connected?
Then we could always stay close to each other...
...and not have to go off in separate directions.
Togetherness. You know what I mean?
Go ahead, it can't be for me.
Hello?
Yes.
No, not yet. I'm not ready.
What time?
I'll meet you. What's the address?
Yes. Goodbye.
Business?
- Yes.
- Industrial-designing business?
All work and no play? A girl like you should be enjoying herself this evening...
...instead of taking phone calls from clients.
What about having dinner with me?
- You can't afford to be seen anyplace.
- Well, let's have it up here. Nice and cozy.
No, I...
I can't.
I insist.
I want you to do a favor for me.
- A big, big favor.
- Name it.
I want you to leave right now.
Stay far away from me and don't come near me again.
We're not going to get involved.
Last night was last night and that's all there was.
That's all there is. There isn't going to be anything more between us.
So, please...
Goodbye.
Good luck. No conversation. Just leave.
- Right away?
- Yes.
No questions asked?
Yes.
- No, I can't do that.
- Please.
- After dinner.
- Now.
After dinner. Fair is fair.
All right.
On one condition.
That you let the hotel valet do something with this suit first.
You belong in the stockyards looking like that.
Okay.
There's the phone.
Hello. Valet service, please.
Hello, valet?
- Oh, this is r... Where are we?
- Four sixty-three.
Room 463.
How quickly can you get a suit sponged and pressed?
Yes, fast.
Twenty minutes? Fine. Okay, 463.
He'll be right up.
Better take your things off.
Now, what could a man do with his clothes off for 20 minutes?
Couldn't he have taken an hour?
You could always take a cold shower.
That's right.
You know, when I was a little boy,
I wouldn't even let my mother undress me.
- You're a big boy now.
- Yes.
Tell me, how does a girl like you get to be a girl like you?
Lucky, I guess.
Oh, not lucky. Naughty. Wicked.
Up to no good. Ever kill anyone?
Because I bet you could tease a man to death without half-trying.
So stop trying, huh?
Be with you in a minute.
Trousers, please.
There you are.
Thank you.
I think I'll take that cold shower after all.
Good.
This magnificent pair of Louis XVI fauteuils.
Original gilt finish.
Upholstered in pure silk damask.
How much may I say to start?
What am I bid?
One hundred.
One hundred is bid. Thank you.
One-fifty is bid here. Say the 200?
Thank you, 200 is bid.
Say the 300? I have 300.
Four hundred by the little lady.
Thank you, sir.
Four-fifty is bid for the pair.
Can I hear 500?
Will you say 500?
Can I say the 500?
Fair warning and last call.
Sold to Mr. Stone, second row.
Four hundred and fifty dollars.
And now lot number 103.
This lovely Aubusson settee.
In excellent condition.
Please start the bidding.
How much?
Eight hundred is offered, thank you.
Eight hundred is bid. Say the nine? Go 900?
Nine hundred is bid.
Now, who'll say 1,000?
One thousand, thank you.
One thousand at 1,000. Say 1,100?
- Can I hear 1,100? Selling at $1,000.
- The three of you together.
Now, that's a picture only Charles Addams could draw.
Good evening, Mr. Kaplan.
Before we start calling each other names, you better tell me yours.
- I haven't had the pleasure.
- You disappoint me, sir.
I was just going to say that to her.
I've always understood you were a shrewd fellow at your job.
What possessed you to come blundering in here like this?
Could it be an overpowering interest in art?
Yes. The art of survival.
Well, have you poured any good drunks lately?
One hundred dollars.
- He followed me here from the hotel.
He was in your room?
Sure, isn't everybody?
One hundred and fifty. Thank you.
Now, say the two.
Do I hear two? Two hundred, thank you.
Now the three. Do I hear three?
Three hundred, anyone?
Three hundred, thank you. Now, the four.
Do I hear four? Four hundred, anyone?
Four hundred is bid. Say the five?
I have 400. I have 400.
I didn't realize you were an art collector.
I thought you just collected corpses.
- Five hundred.
Five hundred, thank you.
I'll bet you paid plenty for this little piece of sculpture.
Now the seven. Seven hundred?
- Seven hundred.
She's worth every dollar of it, take it from me.
Now, she puts her heart into her work.
In fact, her whole body.
Sold to Mr. Vandamm at 700.
- Number 106 for your pleasure.
- Oh, Mr. Vandamm.
Has anyone ever told you that you overplay your various roles rather severely...
...Mr. Kaplan?
First, you're the outraged
Madison Avenue man...
...who claims he's been mistaken for someone else.
Then, you play the fugitive...
...supposedly trying to clear his name of a crime he knows he didn't commit.
Now you play the peevish lover, stung by jealousy and betrayal.
It seems you fellows could stand less training from the FBI...
...and more from the Actors Studio.
Three-fifty I have.
Apparently, the only performance that'll satisfy you is when I play dead.
Your very next role.
You'll be quite convincing, I assure you.
Don't lose it for $25.
Thank you. Three-seventy-five is bid.
I have 375, go the 400.
Three-seventy-five, go four?
Four hundred is bid.
I wonder what subtle form of manslaughter is next on the program.
Am I to be dropped into a vat of molten steel...
...and become part of a new skyscraper?
Or are you going to ask this female to kiss me again and poison me to death?
We offer catalog number 107.
Who are you kidding?
You have no feelings to hurt.
How much to start the bidding on this collector's porcelain?
Please start the bidding.
Kaplan, we've had just about enough of you.
Then, why don't you send for the police?
That's the last thing you'd want, isn't it?
Me in the hands of the police.
There's something I might tell them.
That's the reason you had this one hustle me on the train.
Something seems to tell me
I've got a better chance if I go to the police.
Good night, sweetheart.
Don't think it wasn't nice.
Say the 12. Twelve hundred dollars there. Twelve hundred is bid. Say 1300?
May I hear 1300?
They're selling at 1200.
Do I hear 1300, please?
Last call.
Sold. Twelve hundred dollars. Thank you.
And now catalog number 109.
This superb example of this early 17th century master.
It will enhance any collection of fine art.
What is your pleasure?
How much to start?
One thousand dollars.
One thousand is bid.
Twelve-fifty I have. Now, 1500.
Fifteen hundred is bid. Thank you.
Seventeen-fifty?
- I have 1750.
Two thousand dollars.
Two thousand is bid. I have 2000.
Do I hear 2500?
Twenty-five hundred, anyone?
Twenty-two-fifty once.
Twenty-two-fifty twice.
- Last call.
- Fifteen hundred.
- Well, the bid is already up to 2250, sir.
- I still say 1,500.
I have 2250. Do I hear 25?
- Twenty-two-fifty once, 2250 twice.
- Twelve hundred.
- Sold for 2250. And now...
- Twenty-two-fifty for that chromo?
Number 110 in the catalog.
A Louis XV carved and gilded lit de repos.
Would somebody start the bidding at $750, please?
How do we know it's not a fake?
It looks like a fake.
Well, one thing we know:
You're no fake. You're a genuine idiot.
Thank you.
I wonder if I could respectfully ask the gentleman...
...to get into the spirit of the proceedings.
All right. I'll start it at 8.
Eight hundred. Thank you. Nine hundred?
- One thousand is bid. Go 12?
- Eleven.
Eleven is bid. Thank you. Go 12.
I have 11. Go 12. Who'll say 12?
Eleven once. Who'll say 12?
Eleven twice. Twelve, thank you.
Twelve is bid. I have 12. Go 13.
Who'll say 13?
Thirteen dollars.
You mean 1300, sir.
No, no, no, I mean $13.
That's more than it's worth.
I...
I have 1200. Go 13. Who'll say 13?
Who'll say 1250?
Twelve hundred once, 1200 twice.
- Last call. Twelve hundred.
- Two thousand.
Two thousand?
Twenty-one hundred.
I'm sorry, sir, but we can't...
- Make it 2500.
Ask him to leave.
- Would the gentleman please cooperate?
- The last bid was 1200.
Twenty-five hundred.
My money's as good as anybody's.
- Well, isn't it? Isn't it?
- I have...
- What was it?
- Twelve hundred.
I have 1200 once, 1200 twice.
- Three thousand.
Sold for 1200.
- I'm not gonna let you get away with that.
- You'd better leave, sir.
No, you take your hands off me or I'll sue you.
- What took you so long?
- Let's take a little walk.
- Get moving.
- I haven't finished bidding yet.
Three thousand. I bid 3000.
I'm sorry, old man. Too bad. Keep trying.
Not so rough.
- Handle with care, fellas.
- In there.
- I'm valuable property.
- In.
Well, I want to thank you for saving my life.
Thank you, my friend. Thank you.
Save it for the station house.
Well, let's have some smiles and good cheer.
You're about to become heroes.
Don't you know who I am?
We'll find out as soon as we book you for being drunk and disorderly.
Drunk and disorderly? That's chicken feed.
You've hit the jackpot.
Chicago police capture
United Nations killer.
My name is Roger Thornhill.
Here.
- It's him.
- That's right. Congratulations, man.
Yeah.
This is 1055. Sergeant Flamm.
We've got a man here who answers to the description of Thornhill, Roger.
Code 76.
Wanted by NYPD. Positive ID.
Absolutely. No question.
Michigan Avenue.
Proceeding north to 42nd precinct.
What?
Come again?
Are you sure?
Okay. Right.
Yeah, I got it.
One-oh-five-five, off and clear.
- Where are we going?
- Airport.
- For what?
- Orders.
Airport? I don't wanna be taken to an airport.
- I want to be taken to police headquarters.
- You do, huh?
Why do you think I sent for you?
How about this guy, Charlie?
He sent for us.
- Sit back.
- Didn't you hear what I said?
I want to be taken to police headquarters.
I'm a dangerous assassin.
- I'm a mad killer on the loose.
- You ought to be ashamed of yourself.
They said right here.
Does anyone mind if I sit down?
I've been running all day.
Thought I'd never make it.
Getting too old for this kind of work.
All right, men. Thank you.
- This way, Mr. Thornhill.
- Wait a minute.
We haven't much time.
Yeah, this way is more private.
- I don't think I caught your name.
- I don't think I pitched it.
You're police, aren't you? Or is it FBI?
FBI, CIA, ONI.
- We're all in the same alphabet soup.
- Really?
You can stick this in your alphabet soup.
I had nothing to do with that killing.
- We know that.
- You know it?
Then why did you let the police chase me all over the map?
We never interfere with the police, unless absolutely necessary.
- It's become necessary.
- Oh, I see.
Well, then, I take it
I'm going to be cleared.
I do wish you'd walk faster, Mr. Thornhill.
We'll miss the plane.
Where are we going?
New York or Washington?
Rapid City, South Dakota.
- Rapid City? What for?
- It's near Mount Rushmore.
No, thank you.
I've seen Mount Rushmore.
So has your friend Mr. Vandamm.
Vandamm?
A rather formidable kind of gentleman, eh?
What about that treacherous little tramp with him?
- Miss Kendall?
- Yeah.
His mistress. We know all about her.
Tell me, what's Vandamm up to?
Oh, you could say he's a sort of importer-exporter.
Of what?
Oh. Government secrets, perhaps.
Well, then why don't you grab him?
There's still too much we don't know about his organization.
Oh, I see.
What's all this got to do with Mount Rushmore?
Well, Vandamm has a place near there.
We think it's his jumping-off point to leave the country tomorrow night.
- Are you gonna stop him?
- No.
Well, then what are we going there for?
To set his mind at ease about George Kaplan.
Oh, you, huh?
You're George Kaplan, aren't you?
Oh, no, Mr. Thornhill.
There is no such person as George Kaplan.
What do you mean? I've been in his room.
I've tried on his clothes.
He's got short sleeves and dandruff.
Believe me, Mr. Thornhill, he doesn't exist.
Which is why I'm gonna have to ask you to go on being him for the next 24 hours.
Come on. We'll discuss it on the plane.
Now, look. You started this decoy business without me, you finish it without me.
We might have if you hadn't stumbled into it.
You ought to give me a medal instead of asking me to be a target...
...just so your special agent or whatever doesn't get shot at.
Not shot at, Mr. Thornhill. Found out.
Once found out, they're as good as dead.
Thanks to you, clouds of suspicion are already forming.
Thanks to me?
- If you'll get on the plane...
- You listen to me.
I'm an advertising man, not a red herring.
I've got a job, a secretary, a mother...
...two ex-wives and several bartenders dependent upon me...
...and I don't intend to disappoint them all by getting myself killed.
The answer is no.
- Is that final?
- Yes.
- Goodbye, then.
- Goodbye.
If there was a chance of changing your mind I'd talk about Miss Kendall.
Of whom you so obviously disapprove.
Yes, for using sex like some people use a fly swatter.
I don't suppose it would matter to you...
...that she was probably forced to do whatever she did to protect herself.
To protect herself from what?
Exposure and assassination.
You see, Mr. Thornhill, she...
She's one of our agents.
- Oh, no.
- I know you didn't mean it...
...but I'm afraid you have put her in an extremely dangerous situation.
And much more than her life is at stake.
- Suppose they don't come?
- They'll come.
I don't like the way
Teddy Roosevelt is looking at me.
Perhaps he's trying to give you one last word of caution, Mr. Kaplan.
Speak soft, and carry a big stick.
He's trying to tell me not to go through with this harebrained scheme.
He doesn't know to what extent you're the cause of our present trouble.
I don't know that I care to accept that charge, professor.
Dear, fellow, if you hadn't made yourself so attractive to Miss Kendall...
...that she fell for you...
- And vice versa.
- Our friend Vandamm wouldn't be losing faith in her loyalty now.
It was quite obvious to him last night that she had become emotionally involved.
Worst of all, with a man he thinks is a government agent.
Are you trying to tell me that I'm irresistible?
I'm trying to remind you it is your responsibility to help us restore her...
...to Vandamm's good graces...
...right up to the point he leaves the country tonight.
All right, all right.
But, after tonight...
My blessings on you both.
Here they are.
- Good afternoon, Mr. Kaplan.
- Not her.
Did I misunderstand you about bringing her here?
We'll get to that later.
I suppose you were surprised to get my call.
Not at all. I knew the police would release you, Mr. Kaplan.
By the way, I want to compliment you on your colorful exit...
...from the auction gallery.
Thank you.
And now, what little drama are we here for today?
I don't for a moment believe that you've invited me to these gay surroundings...
...to come to a business arrangement.
Suppose I tell you I not only know the exact time you're leaving the country tonight...
...but the latitude and longitude of your rendezvous...
...and your ultimate destination.
You wouldn't care to carry my bags for me, would you?
Perhaps you'd be interested in the price, just the same.
- The price?
- For doing nothing to stop you.
How much did you have in mind?
I want the girl.
I want the girl to get what's coming to her.
Turn her over to me, I'll see there's enough pinned on her to keep her...
...uncomfortable for the rest of her life.
You do that, and I'll look the other way tonight.
She really did get under your skin.
We're not talking about my skin.
We're talking about yours.
- I'm offering you a chance to save it.
To exchange it.
Put it any way you like.
I'm curious, Mr. Kaplan.
What made you arrive at the deduction that my feelings for Miss Kendall...
...have deteriorated to the point where
I would trade her in for peace of mind?
I don't deduce. I observe.
Phillip, if you don't mind,
I'm going back to the house now.
Just a second, you.
Stay away from me. Let go.
Let go of me.
Stay away from me. Let go.
Let go of me.
- Now, save the phony tears.
- You just get back.
- You little fool.
- You just stay away from me.
No good, sir.
You can't get involved in this.
- Don't touch anything.
- Stand back.
Stand back.
Mr. Thornhill?
Don't be long.
Hello.
Hello.
Are you all right?
Yes, I think so.
I asked the professor if I could see you again.
There's not much time.
Isn’t there?
I wanted to tell you...
I mean, apologize.
No need.
I understand.
All in the line of duty.
I did treat you miserably.
I, uh...
I hated you for it.
I didn't want you to go on thinking that I...
And I... I used some pretty harsh words.
I'm sorry.
They hurt deeply.
- Well, naturally, if I'd known...
- I couldn't tell you.
- Of course not.
- Could I?
No, I guess not.
You didn't get hurt. I'm so relieved.
- Of course I was hurt.
- How would you have felt?
- In the cafeteria, when you fell.
- When I shot you with the blanks.
- Oh, that. No.
You did it rather well, I thought.
- Yes, I thought I was quite graceful.
Considering it's not really your kind of work.
Well, I got into it by accident.
What's your excuse?
I met Phillip Vandamm at a party one night and saw only his charm.
Oh.
I guess I had nothing to do that weekend, so I...
I decided to fall in love.
Well, that's nice.
Eventually, the professor and his
Washington colleagues approached me...
...with a few sordid details about Phillip and he told me that...
...my relationship with him made me uniquely valuable to them.
So you became a Girl Scout, huh?
Maybe it was the first time anyone ever asked me to do anything worthwhile.
Has life been like that?
How come?
Men like you.
What's wrong with men like me?
They don't believe in marriage.
I've been married twice.
See what I mean?
I may go back to hating you.
It was more fun.
Goodbye, darling.
- Wait a minute. Not so soon.
- No, I gotta get back and convince them...
...that I took the long way around so nobody followed me.
Couldn't we stand like this for just a few hours?
Just this time you're supposed to be critically wounded.
I never felt more alive.
Well, whose side are you on?
Yours, always, darling.
Please don't undermine my resolve just when I need it most.
Oh, well, I guess it's off to the hospital for me and back to danger for you.
I don't like it a bit.
It's much safer now, thanks to you, my darling decoy.
Don't thank me. I couldn't stand it.
All right. I won't.
After your malevolent friend Vandamm takes off tonight...
...you and I are gonna get together and do a lot of apologizing to each other in private.
- You know that can't be.
- Of course it can be.
He has told you, hasn't he?
- Told me what?
- Miss Kendall, you gotta get moving.
- Wait a minute. What didn't you tell me?
- Why didn't you?
She's going off with Vandamm tonight on the plane.
She's going off with Vandamm?
We went to such lengths to make her a fugitive from justice.
So that Vandamm couldn't very well decline to take her along.
I needn't tell you how valuable she can be to us over there.
You lied to me.
You said that after tonight...
- I needed your help.
- Well, you got it, all right.
Don't be angry.
You think I'm gonna let you go through with this?
- Oh, she has to.
- Nobody has to do anything.
I don't like the games you play, professor.
War is hell, Mr. Thornhill, even when it's a cold one.
If you can't lick the Vandamms of this world...
...without asking girls to bed down and fly away with them...
...and never come back...
...perhaps you ought to learn how to lose a few cold wars.
I'm afraid we're already doing that.
- I'm not gonna let you do this. Get out.
- Please don't spoil everything. Please.
Mr. Kaplan twice in full view of horrified men, women and children...
...who had come to the park to see the famed Mount Rushmore monument.
Witnesses described Kaplan's assailant as an attractive blonde in her late twenties.
Kaplan, who was removed to the
Rapid City Hospital in critical condition...
...has been tentatively identified as an employee of the federal government.
The tragedy developed with startling suddenness.
Chris Swenson, a busboy in the Mount Rushmore cafeteria...
...stated that he heard voices raised in...
- Here we are.
- Hello.
Slacks, a shirt and these.
Thanks.
That'll do for you around here for the next couple of days.
For the next couple of days?
- Hey.
- What?
What's this?
That's where I hit the chair doing that phony fall in the cafeteria.
You and your dopey schemes, shootings.
- Otherwise, feeling all right?
- Oh, yeah. Fine.
Considering your driver has a sledgehammer for a hand.
Yeah, I'm sorry about that.
No, that's all right. I guess I deserved it.
I guess I deserve that locked door too.
You seen wandering about in good health could've proved fatal to Miss Kendall.
- I've begun to forget her already.
- Good.
- Better that way.
- Yeah, much.
Inside of an hour, she'll be gone.
- How's everything out in Rapid City?
- Oh, everything's fine.
Mr. Kaplan's untimely shooting has now acquired the authority of the printed word.
Everyone's been cooperating beautifully.
Well, now you can include me.
- I'm a cooperator.
- I'm most grateful.
- Care to do me a favor in return?
- Anything.
I'd like a drink. Will you get me a...?
Get me some bourbon?
A pint will do.
Can I join you?
Well, if you're gonna join me, you better make it a quart.
- See you in a few minutes.
- Yeah.
- Stop.
- Oh, excuse me.
Stop.
- You don't want me to take you up there?
- No, thanks. Never mind.
Oh, thanks.
There's nothing to worry about.
I just lost my head.
I'm not just saying this to make you feel better.
I mean it.
I just didn't know what I was doing.
He wanted to destroy you.
You had to protect yourself.
But not endanger you.
Ah, rubbish.
Soon we'll be off together and I shall dedicate myself to your happiness.
What's the situation, Leonard?
- About the plane, you mean?
- Of course.
What was the last report?
Over Whitestone on the hour,
6000, descending.
About ten minutes, huh?
At the most.
And now, uh...
I wonder if I might have a few words of parting with you, sir?
Certainly.
In private?
I'll go up and get my things.
Well, Leonard...
...how does one say goodbye to one's right arm?
I'm afraid you're gonna wish you had cut it off sooner.
I know how terribly fond you are of Miss Kendall...
I don't find this a terribly attractive...
- She is not to be trusted.
- You're being mysterious.
I'm not being mysterious at all.
It couldn't have been anything.
You must've had some doubts about her yourself.
- And still do.
Rubbish.
Why else would you have decided not to tell her...
...that our little treasure here has a bellyful of microfilm?
You seem to be trying to fill mine with rotten apples.
Sometimes the truth does taste like worms.
The truth? I've heard nothing but innuendoes.
Call it my woman's intuition if you will, but I've never trusted neatness.
Neatness is always the result of deliberate planning.
She shot him in a moment of fear and anger.
- You were there yourself. You saw it.
Yes.
And thereby wrapped everything up into one very neat and tidy bundle.
A, she removed any doubts you may have had about her, uh...
Now, what did you call it, her devotion?
B, she gave herself a new and urgent reason to be taken to the other side with you...
...in case you decided to change your mind.
- You know what I think?
I think you're jealous.
No, I mean it, and I'm very touched. Very...
Leonard!
The gun she shot Kaplan with.
I found it in her luggage.
It's an old trick. Shoot one of your own to show that you're not one of them.
They've just freshened it up a bit with blank cartridges.
What was that noise?
Yes, we wondered what it was too.
Didn't we, Leonard?
Hurry, darling. It's almost time to leave.
In a moment.
You're not taking her on that plane with you?
Of course I am.
Like our friends,
I too believe in neatness, Leonard.
This matter is best disposed of from a great height...
...over water.
How about a little champagne before we go?
I'd love it.
It may not be cold enough.
Over the rocks will be all right.
Are you sure?
My dear.
Thank you.
To you, my dear, and all the lovely moments we've had together.
Thank you, Phillip.
There he is.
Jump in, Leonard. The champagne's fine.
There isn't time.
You always were a spoilsport, weren't you?
One of my most valuable attributes as it now turns out.
It would please me if you would think of me as being along on this journey...
...if only in spirit.
I shall, Leonard.
He's heading pretty far out on the north leg and awfully high.
I guess he's gonna play it safe with a long, slow descent.
You couldn't ask for a better night than this.
Ceiling and possibilities unlimited.
Ah, there he goes, starting his turn.
Well, we better get moving.
He should have his wheels on the ground inside of three minutes.
- Come along, Eve.
All right.
I think I left my earrings upstairs.
I'll be right down.
We can get out through the window.
There's a car.
What are you doing?
You'll ruin everything.
They know about the shooting.
They're going to do away with you!
- What are you talking about?
- Leonard found the gun in your luggage.
The figure they got at the auction is filled with microfilm.
- That's how he's been getting it.
Miss Kendall?
Whatever you do, don't get on that plane.
Don't worry, Anna.
Arrangements have been made.
You and your husband will be over the Canadian border by morning.
Thank you very much, sir.
- Be careful.
We will, sir, and God bless you.
Thank you for everything.
Be careful, now.
Now, you're not gonna leave the house until we're...
I'll wait, sir. I certainly will. Safe journey.
Thank you very much.
Bye.
Stay where you are.
Sit down.
As soon as the plane leaves, my husband and Mr. Leonard will be back.
What is it?
I was wondering about my earrings.
They'll turn up.
When you return to New York, say goodbye to my sister for me.
And thank her for her superb performance as Mrs. Townsend.
I'll do that.
Tell your knife-throwing chum...
...that I've reassured his wife.
All right.
- That's about all, Leonard.
Get that figure back from her.
The housekeeper had me pinned down...
...before I realized it was that same silly gun of yours.
- I see you've got the pumpkin.
- Yes.
This is no good.
We're on top of the monument.
What do we do?
Climb down.
We can't.
Here they come. We have no choice.
Well, if we ever get out of this alive...
...let's go back to New York on the train together.
All right?
Is that a proposition?
It's a proposal, sweetie.
What happened to the first two marriages?
My wives divorced me.
- Why?
- Well, I think they said I led too dull a life.
- Ha, ha.
- Come on.
You all right?
All right, all right.
Okay. Come on.
Come on. Come up here.
Come on. Come on. Come on.
Help. Help me.
Thank you, sergeant.
That wasn't very sporting, using real bullets?
Here, reach. Now.
- I'm trying.
- Come on, I've got you.
- Up.
- I can't make it.
Yes, you can. Come on.
- Pull harder.
- Come along, Mrs. Thornhill.
- Oh. Roger, this is silly.
- I know, but I'm sentimental.
Give me your hand!
Give me your hand.
I thought you said no more aches or pains.
No, it's this darned corset.
It binds.
No three-way stretch?
How very un-chic.
You know those police department doctors.
No sense of style.
Well, anyway, tomorrow will be the day.
Why, what's tomorrow?
Tomorrow? The corset comes off tomorrow.
I'll be able to scratch myself like anybody else tomorrow.
I'll throw this miserable thing out the window.
Be a free... I'll be a free man.
Midge, do you suppose many men wear corsets?
- Mmm. More than you think.
- Really?
What, do you know that from personal experience or...
Please.
What happens after tomorrow?
What do you mean?
Well, what are you going to do once you've quit the police force?
You sound so disapproving, Midge.
No, it's your life.
But you were the bright, young lawyer that decided he was going to be chief of police someday.
I had to quit.
Why?
Well, it's because of this fear of heights
I have, this acrophobia.
I wake up at night seeing that man fall from the roof, and I try to reach out to him, and... It's just...
It wasn't your fault.
I know. That's what everybody tells me.
Johnny, the doctors explained to you...
I know, I know.
I have acrophobia, which gives me vertigo, and I get dizzy.
Boy! What a moment to find out I had it.
Well, you've got it, and there's no losing it.
And there's no one to blame.
So why quit?
You mean, and sit behind a desk, chair-borne?
Where you belong.
What about my acrophobia?
What about...
Now suppose I'm sitting in this chair, behind the desk. Here's the desk.
And a pencil falls from the desk down to the floor, and I reach down to pick up the pencil.
Bingo! My acrophobia's back.
Oh, Johnny-O.
Well, what'll you do?
Well, I'm not gonna do anything for a while.
You know, don't forget, I'm a man of independent means, as the saying goes.
Fairly independent.
Mmm-hmm.
Well, why don't you go away for a while?
You mean, to forget?
Oh, no, Midge, don't be so motherly.
I'm not gonna crack up.
Have you had any dizzy spells this week?
I'm having one right now.
Midge, the music.
Don't you think it's sort of...
Oh.
What's this doohickey?
It's a brassiere. You know about those things.
You're a big boy now.
I've never run across one like that.
It's brand-new.
Revolutionary uplift.
No shoulder straps, no back straps, but does everything a brassiere should do.
Works on the principle of the cantilever bridge.
- It does?
- Mmm-hmm.
An aircraft engineer down the peninsula designed it.
He worked it out in his spare time.
Kind of a hobby.
A do-it-yourself type of thing.
How's your love life, Midge?
That's following a train of thought.
Well...
Normal.
Aren't you ever gonna get married?
You know there's only one man in the world for me, Johnny-O.
You mean me.
We were engaged once, though, weren't we?
Three whole weeks.
Good old college days.
But you were the one that called off the engagement, you remember?
I'm still available.
Available Ferguson.
Oh, Midge, do you remember a fellow in college by the name of Gavin Elster?
Gavin Elster?
Yes, funny name.
You think I would. No.
I got a call from Gavin today.
It's funny, he sort of dropped out of sight during the war.
Somebody said he went East.
I guess he's back.
It's a Mission number.
Well, that's skid row, isn't it?
Could be.
He's probably on the bum, and wants to touch you for the price of a drink.
Well, I'm on the bum.
I'll buy him a couple drinks and tell him my troubles.
But not tonight.
How about you and me going out for a beer?
Mmm-mmm. Sorry, old man. Work.
Well, then, I think I'll go home.
Midge, what'd you mean,
"There's no losing it"?
What?
The acrophobia.
I asked my doctor.
He said that only another emotional shock could do it and probably wouldn't.
You're not gonna go diving off another rooftop to find out?
- I think I can lick it.
- Well, how?
I have a theory.
I have a theory. I think if I can get used to heights, just a little bit at a time, just a little, like that, progressively, you see?
I'll show you what I mean.
Here. I'll show you what I mean.
- We'll start with this.
- That?
What do you want me to start with, the Golden Gate Bridge? Now, watch.
Watch this. Here we go.
There. There.
Now, I look up, I look down.
I look up.
- All right, there's nothing to it.
- You're kidding.
- Wait a minute.
- There's nothing to it.
Here.
That's a girl. I'll use that.
Put it right there.
All right, here's the first step.
There.
Okay, now step number two.
All right.
Step number two coming up.
There we are.
See? I look up, I look down,
I look up...
I'm going right out and buy myself a nice tall stepladder.
Take it easy now.
All right, now here we go.
No problem.
Why, this is a cinch.
Here, I look up, I look down.
I look up, I look down.
Oh, Johnny, Johnny.
How did you get in the shipbuilding business, Gavin?
I married into it.
Very interesting business.
No, to be honest, I find it dull.
Well, you don't have to do it for a living.
No, but one assumes responsibilities.
My wife's family is all gone.
Someone has to look after her interests.
Her father's partner runs the company yard in the East, Baltimore.
So I decided, as long as I had to work at it,
I'd come back here.
I've always liked it here.
How long have you been back?
Almost a year.
You like it, huh?
Well, San Francisco's changed.
The things that spell San Francisco to me are disappearing fast.
Like all these.
Yes. I should have liked to have lived here then.
Color, excitement, power.
Freedom.
Shouldn't you be sitting down?
No. No, I'm all right.
I was sorry to read about that thing in the paper.
And you've quit the force.
Is it a permanent physical disability?
No, no.
It just means that I can't climb stairs that are too steep or go to high places, like the bar at the Top of the Mark.
But, there are plenty of street-level bars in this town.
Would you like a drink now?
No, I don't think so.
No, it's a little early in the day for me.
Well, I guess that just about covers everything, doesn't it?
I never married.
I don't see much of the old college gang,
I'm a retired detective, and you're in the shipbuilding business.
What's on your mind, Gavin?
I asked you to come up here, Scottie, knowing that you'd quit detective work.
But I wondered whether you'd go back on the job as a special favor to me.
I want you to follow my wife.
No, it's not that.
We're very happily married.
Well, then...
I'm afraid some harm may come to her.
From whom?
Someone dead.
Scottie, do you believe that someone out of the past, someone dead, can enter and take possession of a living being?
No.
If I told you that I believe this has happened to my wife, what would you say?
Well, I'd say take her to the nearest psychiatrist, or psychologist, or neurologist, or psycho...
Or maybe just the plain family doctor.
I'd have him check on you, too.
Then you're of no use to me.
I'm sorry I wasted your time.
Thanks for coming in, Scottie.
Okay.
I... I didn't mean to be that rough.
No, it sounds idiotic, I know.
And you're still the hardheaded Scot, aren't you?
Always were.
Do you think I'm making it up?
No.
I'm not making it up.
I wouldn't know how.
She'll be talking to me about something.
Suddenly, the words fade into silence.
A cloud comes into her eyes and they go blank.
She's somewhere else, away from me, someone I don't know.
I call to her, she doesn't even hear me.
Then, with a long sigh, she's back, looks at me brightly, doesn't even know she's been away.
Can't tell me where or when.
Well, how often does this happen?
More and more in the past few weeks.
And she wanders.
God knows where she wanders.
I followed her one day, watched her coming out of the apartment, someone I didn't know.
She even walked a different way.
Got into her car and drove out to Golden Gate Park, five miles.
Sat by the lake, staring across the water at the pillars that stand on the far shore.
You know, Portals of the Past.
Sat there a long time, without moving.
I had to leave, get back to the office.
When I got home that evening,
I asked her what she'd done all day.
She said she'd driven out to Golden Gate Park and sat by the lake, that's all.
Well?
The speedometer on her car showed that she'd driven 94 miles.
Where did she go?
I've gotta know, Scottie, where she goes and what she does before I get involved with doctors.
Well, have you talked to the doctors at all, about that?
Yes, but carefully.
I want to know more before committing her to that kind of care.
Scottie...
All right, I'll get you a firm of private eyes to follow her for you.
They're dependable, good boys.
I want you.
Look, this isn't my line.
Scottie, I need a friend, someone I can trust.
I'm in a panic about this.
I'm supposed to be retired.
I don't want to get mixed up in this darn thing.
Look, we're going to an opening at the opera tonight.
We're dining at Ernie's first.
You can see her there.
Ernie's.
Say, will you tell me something about the lady sitting in there?
Who's the woman in the painting she's looking at?
Oh, that's Carlotta.
You'll find it in the catalog.
Portrait of Carlotta.
- May I have this?
- Yes.
Thank you.
Yes?
Is there something I can do for you?
- Yes. You run this hotel?
- Oh, yes.
Would you tell me who has the room on the second floor in the corner, that corner?
Oh, I'm afraid we couldn't give out information of that sort.
Our clients are entitled to their privacy, you know.
And I do believe it's against the law.
Of course, I don't think any of them would mind, really, but still I...
Oh, dear, has she done something wrong?
Please answer my question.
I can't imagine that sweet girl with that dear face...
What's her name?
Valdes. Miss Valdes. Spanish, you know.
Carlotta Valdes?
Yeah, that's it.
Sweet name, isn't it?
Foreign, but sweet.
How long has she had the room?
Oh, it must be two weeks.
Her rent's due tomorrow.
Does she sleep here, ever?
No, she just comes to sit two or three times a week.
I don't ask questions, you know, as long as they're well-behaved.
But I must say...
When she comes down, don't say that I've been here.
Oh, but she hasn't been here today.
I just saw her come in five minutes ago.
No, she hasn't been here at all.
Well, I would have seen her, you know.
I've been right here all the time, putting olive oil on my rubber plant leaves.
And there. There, you see?
Her key is on the rack.
Well, would you please go up and look?
- To her room?
- That's right.
Yes, of course, if you ask.
- But it does seem silly.
- Thank you.
Oh, Mr. Detective?
Would you like to come and look?
Her car's gone.
What car?
Midge, who do you know that's an authority on San Francisco history?
That's the kind of greeting a girl likes.
None of this,
"Hello, you look wonderful," stuff.
Just a good straight, "Who do you know that's an authority on San Francisco..."
- Want a drink?
- No, thanks.
Well, who do you?
You know everybody.
Professor Saunders, over in Berkeley.
No, no, I don't mean that kind of history.
I mean the small stuff, you know, people you never heard of.
Oh.
Well, you mean the gay old bohemian days of gay old San Francisco.
Juicy stories, like who shot who in the Embarcadero in August, 1879.
Yeah, that's right.
- Pop Leibel.
- Who?
Pop Leibel. He owns the Argosy Book Shop.
Why, what do you want to know?
I want to know who shot who in the Embarcadero in August, 1879.
Hey, wait a minute.
You're not a detective anymore.
What's going on?
You know him well?
Who?
Pop Leibel.
Oh, sure.
Well, come on, let's go.
I want you to introduce me. Get your hat.
I don't need a hat.
Hey, Johnny, what's it all about?
Hey.
Wait a minute.
Hello. Yes, I remember. Carlotta.
The beautiful Carlotta.
The sad Carlotta.
What does an old wooden house at the corner of Eddy and Gough Street have to do with Carlotta Valdes?
Well, it was hers.
It was built for her many years ago.
- By whom?
- By...
By...
No. The name, I do not remember.
A rich man, a powerful man.
- Cigarette?
- No, thank you.
- Cigarette, miss?
- No, thanks.
It is not an unusual story.
She came from somewhere small to the south of the city.
Some say from a mission settlement.
Young, yes. Very young.
And she was found dancing and singing in a cabaret by that man.
And he took her and built for her the great house in the Western Addition.
And there was a...
There was a child.
Yes, that's it. A child. A child.
I cannot tell you exactly how much time passed, or how much happiness there was.
But, then, he threw her away.
He had no other children.
His wife had no children.
So he kept the child and threw her away.
You know, a man could do that in those days.
They had the power and the freedom.
And she became the sad Carlotta.
Alone in the great house, walking the streets alone.
Her clothes becoming old and patched and dirty.
And the mad Carlotta.
Stopping people in the streets to ask,
"Where is my child?
"Have you seen my child?"
Poor thing.
And she died.
- She died.
- How?
By her own hand.
There are many such stories.
- Well, thank you very much.
- You are welcome.
I appreciate it. Good-bye.
Good-bye.
Hey, wait a minute! Good-bye, Pop.
Thanks a lot.
- Now then, Johnny-O, pay me.
- For what?
For bringing you here.
Come on, tell.
There's nothing to tell.
You'll tell or you'll be back in that corset.
Come on, Johnny, please.
Come on, come on. I'll take you home.
There we are.
- You haven't told me everything.
- No, I've told you enough.
Who's the guy and who's the wife?
Out. I've got things to do.
I know. The one that phoned, your old college chum, Elster.
- Midge, out, please.
- And the idea is that the beautiful, mad Carlotta has come back from the dead and taken possession of Elster's wife.
Now, Johnny, really. Come on.
Well, I'm not telling you what I think.
I'm telling you what he thinks.
Well, what do you think?
Well, I...
- Is she pretty?
- Carlotta?
No, not Carlotta. Elster's wife.
Yes.
I guess you'd consider that she would be...
I think I'll go take a look at that portrait. Good-bye.
Midge...
- Good-bye.
- Midge, you...
You've done well, Scottie.
You're good at your job.
- That's Carlotta Valdes.
- Yes.
There are things you didn't tell me.
- I didn't know where she'd lead you.
- But you knew about this.
Oh, yeah.
You notice the way she does her hair?
You know, there's something else.
My wife, Madeleine, has several pieces of jewelry that belonged to Carlotta.
She inherited them.
Never wore them.
They were too old-fashioned.
Until now.
Now, when she's alone, she takes them out and looks at them, handles them gently, curiously.
Puts them on and stares at herself in the mirror.
And goes into that other world, is someone else again.
Now, Carlotta Valdes was what?
Your wife's grandmother?
Great-grandmother.
Now, the child who was taken from her, whose loss drove Carlotta mad and to her death, was Madeleine's grandmother.
And the McKittrick Hotel is the old Valdes home.
Well, I think that explains it.
Anyone could become obsessed with the past with a background like that.
She never heard of Carlotta Valdes.
She knows nothing of a grave out at the Mission Dolores?
Or that old house on Eddy Street? The...
- The portrait at the Palace of the Legion of...
- Nothing.
Well, when she goes to these places...
She's no longer my wife.
Well, how do you know all these things she doesn't?
Her mother told me most of them before she died.
I dug out the rest for myself here.
Why wouldn't she tell her daughter?
Natural fear.
Her grandmother went insane, took her own life.
Her blood is in Madeleine.
Boy, I need this.
Madeleine.
Madeleine!
Yes?
No, it's all right.
Yeah, I'll call you back.
Yes.
Yes.
Are you all right?
Oh. Oh, your...
You'll want this.
You'd better come over here by the fire where it's warm.
What am I doing here?
What happened?
Well, you fell into San Francisco Bay.
And I tried to dry your hair as best I could.
Your things are in the kitchen.
They'll be dry in a few minutes.
Come on over by the fire.
Here, I'll get you some cushions.
There you are.
Would you like to have some coffee?
Here, you'd better have some.
Or perhaps you'd like a drink.
I fell into the Bay and you fished me out?
That's right.
Thank you.
You don't remember?
No, I...
You remember where you were?
Why, yes. Yes, of course I remember that.
But then I must have had a dizzy spell and fainted.
Where were you?
At old Fort Point, out at the Presidio.
Of course, I remember.
I often go there.
Why? Why do you go there?
Because I love it so.
It's beautiful there, especially at sunset.
Thank you for the fire.
Where were you before?
- When?
- This afternoon, I mean.
Wandering about.
I know, but where?
Where were you just before?
Downtown, shopping.
Here, you'd better have some coffee.
I think it's still warm.
You're terribly direct in your questions.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to be rude.
You're not. You're merely direct.
And what were you doing there, at old Fort Point?
Oh, just wandering about.
Oh, you like it too?
Yes.
And where had you been just before?
I'd been to the Palace of the
Legion of Honor, the art gallery.
Oh, yes, that's a lovely spot, isn't it?
I've never been inside, but it looks so lovely driving past.
It's lucky for me you were wandering about.
Thank you.
I've been a terrible bother to you.
No, you haven't.
Oh, when you...
There were some pins in my hair.
Oh, the pins, yes. Right in here.
I'll get them for you.
And my purse, please.
Here you are.
Thank you.
You shouldn't have brought me here, you know.
Well, I didn't know where you lived.
You could have looked in my car.
Oh, but then, you didn't know my car, did you?
No, I knew which one it was.
It's right outside here now.
But I didn't think you wanted to be taken home that way.
No, you're right.
I'm glad you didn't take me home.
I wouldn't have known you.
Thank you. But I don't know you, and you don't know me.
My name is Madeleine Elster.
My name's John Ferguson.
Good, strong name.
Do your friends call you John or Jack?
Oh, John, mostly.
Old friends call me John.
Acquaintances call me Scottie.
I shall call you Mr. Ferguson.
Oh, gee whiz, I wouldn't like that.
Oh, no.
And after what happened this afternoon,
I should think maybe you'd call me Scottie.
Maybe even John.
I prefer John.
There, that's done.
And what do you do, John?
Wander about.
That's a good occupation.
And you live here, alone?
One shouldn't live alone.
Some people prefer it.
No, it's wrong.
I'm married, you know.
Will you tell me something?
Has this ever happened to you before?
What?
Falling into San Francisco Bay.
Oh.
No. No, it's never happened before.
Oh, I've fallen into lakes out of rowboats when I was a little girl.
I even fell into the river once, trying to leap from one stone to another.
But I've never fallen into San Francisco Bay.
Have you ever before?
No, it's the first time for me, too.
Here, I'll get you some more coffee.
Hello?
Scottie, what happened?
She's not home yet.
No, she's all right. She's still here.
I'll bring her home soon.
Oh, what happened?
She went into the Bay.
Hello? Hello?
Did she hurt herself?
No, she's going to be in fine shape.
There's nothing to worry about.
But she doesn't know.
Now, do you understand that?
She doesn't know what happened.
Scottie, Madeleine is 26.
Carlotta Valdes committed suicide when she was 26.
Just hold on a minute, Gavin.
Well now, Johnny-O. 
Was it a ghost?
Was it fun?
That letter for me?
Yes. Hello.
Hello.
I worried about you last night.
You shouldn't have run off that way.
Well, I suddenly felt such a fool.
I wanted to drive you home.
Are you all right?
Oh, yes. Yes, I'm fine.
No aftereffects.
But as I remember now, the water was cold, wasn't it?
It sure was.
What a terrible thing for me to do.
You were so kind.
It's a formal thank-you note and a great big apology.
Oh, you've nothing to apologize for.
Oh, yes, I do.
The whole thing must have been so embarrassing for you.
Not at all. I enjoyed talking to you.
Well, I enjoyed talking to you.
Well, I'll get my mail.
Would you like to have a cup of coffee?
No. No, thank you.
Well, I couldn't mail it.
I didn't know your address, but I had a landmark.
I remembered Coit Tower.
It led me straight to you.
Well, that's the first time
I've been grateful for Coit Tower.
I hope we will, too.
What?
Meet again sometime.
We have.
Good-bye.
Where are you going?
- Oh, I don't know.
- Shopping?
No.
Well, anywhere in particular?
No, I just thought that I'd wander.
Oh, that's what I was going to do.
Oh, yes, that's right. I forgot.
It's your occupation, isn't it?
Yeah, well, don't you think it's kind of a waste for the two of us...
- To wander separately?
- Uh-huh.
But only one is a wanderer.
Two together are always going somewhere.
No, I don't think that's necessarily true.
You left your door open.
Be right back.
How old?
Oh, some 2,000 years or more.
The oldest living things.
Yes.
You've never been here before?
No.
What are you thinking?
Of all the people who've been born and have died, while the trees went on living.
Their true name is Sequoia sempervirens.
"Always green, ever living."
- I don't like them.
- Why?
Knowing I have to die.
Here's a cross section of one of the old trees that's been cut down.
Somewhere in here, I was born, and there I died.
It was only a moment for you.
You took no notice.
Madeleine.
Madeleine.
Madeleine, where are you now?
- Here with you.
- Where?
Tall trees...
Have you been here before?
- Yes.
- When?
When were you born?
- Long ago.
- Where?
When? Tell me.
- Madeleine, tell me.
- No!
Madeleine, tell me what it is.
Where do you go?
- What takes you away?
- No, I can't tell you.
When you jumped into the bay, you didn't know where you were.
- You guessed, but you didn't know.
- I didn't jump.
- I didn't jump. I fell. You told me I fell.
- Why did you jump?
- Why did you jump?
- I can't tell you.
Why did you jump?
What was there inside
- that told you to jump?
- No, please. Please.
What? What?
Please don't ask me. Please don't ask me.
Take me away from here.
Shall I take you home?
Somewhere in the light.
Promise me something.
Promise you won't ask me again.
Please promise me that.
Why did you run?
I'm responsible for you now.
You know, the Chinese say that once you've saved a person's life, you're responsible for it forever, so I'm committed.
I have to know.
There's so little that I know.
It's as though I were walking down a long corridor that once was mirrored, and fragments of that mirror still hang there.
And when I come to the end of the corridor, there's nothing but darkness.
And I know that when
I walk into the darkness, that I'll die.
I've never come to the end.
I've always come back before then.
Except once.
Yesterday?
And you didn't know.
You didn't know what happened till you found yourself with me.
You didn't know where you were.
But the small scenes, the fragments of the mirror, you remember those.
- Vaguely.
- What do you remember?
There's a room, and I sit there alone.
Always alone.
What else?
A grave.
Where?
I don't know.
It's an open grave and I...
I stand by the gravestone, looking down into it.
- It's my grave.
- But how do you know?
I know.
But is there a name on the gravestone?
No. No, it's new and clean and waiting.
Well, what else?
This part is a dream. I think.
There's a tower, and a bell and a garden below.
It seems to be in Spain, a village in Spain.
It clicks off and it's gone.
Well, a portrait?
- Do you see a portrait?
- No.
If I could just find the key, the beginning, and put it together, I...
So, explain it away?
There's a way to explain it, you see.
If I'm mad, then that would explain it, wouldn't it?
Madeleine!
Oh, Scottie!
I'm not mad! I'm not mad!
I don't want to die.
There's someone within me, and she says I must die.
Oh, Scottie, don't let me go.
I'm here. I've got you.
I'm so afraid.
Don't leave me.
Stay with me.
All the time.
Hi, Johnny.
Hi.
Did you get my message?
I did, indeed.
I'll get you a drink.
Okay.
Since when do you go around slipping notes under men's doors?
Since I stopped being able to get them on the phone.
For a man who has nothing to do, you're certainly a busy little bee.
Where do you go these days?
Just wandering.
Where?
Round about.
Oh.
What was this...
What was this desperate urge to see me?
All I said in my note was,
"Where are you?"
Doesn't sound very desperate to me.
Yeah, I detected a little undercurrent.
Well, I just thought that if I gave you a drink and fed you some dinner, you'd be so grateful, you'd take me to a movie.
That's fair enough.
What'll we talk about at dinner?
Oh, this and that.
What I've been doing?
Only if you want to.
I'm sure we won't talk about anything you don't want to talk about.
Naturally.
What have you been doing?
Wandering.
What have you been doing?
Thank you, dear.
Oh, I've been having a wonderful time.
I've gone back to my first love, painting.
Well, good for you.
I always said you were wasting your time in the underwear department.
You know, it's a living.
But I'm really excited about this.
What is it? A still life?
No. No, not exactly.
You wanna see?
Hmm. Yeah.
Matter of fact, I thought
I might give it to you.
Oh?
Johnny!
It's not funny, Midge.
- Johnny!
- No.
Johnny, I just thought...
Uh-uh.
No.
Let's make that movie some other night, okay?
Johnny!
Oh, Marjorie Wood, you fool!
Idiot!
Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!
Madeleine! What's the matter?
What time is it?
I should have phoned you, but I wanted to see you and be with you.
Why? What's happened?
I had the dream.
The dream came back again.
Now, now, it's gonna be all right.
It'll be all right.
Here, I'll get you some brandy.
Just drink this down.
Here, just like medicine.
There now.
It was a dream. You're awake.
You're all right now.
Now, can you tell me?
It was the tower again, and the bell, and the old Spanish village.
Yes?
Clear, so very clear for the first time.
All of it.
Tell me.
It was a village square and a green with trees, and an old whitewashed Spanish church with a cloister.
Across the green, there was a big, gray, wooden house, with a porch and shutters and a balcony above, a small garden, and next to it a livery stable with old carriages lined up inside.
Go on.
At the end of the green, there was a whitewashed stone house, with a lovely pepper tree at the corner.
And an old wooden hotel from the old California days?
And a saloon? Dark, low ceilings, with hanging oil lamps?
Yes.
It's all there. It's no dream.
You've been there before.
You've seen it.
No, never.
Madeleine, a hundred miles south of San Francisco, there's an old Spanish mission,
San Juan Bautista it's called, and it's been preserved exactly as it was 100 years ago, as a museum.
Now, think hard, darling.
Think hard.
You've been there before.
You've seen it.
No, no, I've never...
I've never been there.
Oh, Scottie, what is it?
I've never been there.
Think hard.
Now go on about your dream.
What was it that frightened you so?
I stood alone on the green searching for something.
And then I started to walk to the church.
But then the darkness closed in and I was alone in the dark.
Being pulled into the darkness, and I fought to wake up.
Oh, you're going to be all right now, Madeleine.
Don't you see?
You've given me something to work on now.
I'm going to take you down there to that mission, this afternoon.
And when you see it, you'll remember when you saw it before, and it'll finish your dream. It'll destroy it.
I promise you. All right?
Come on now.
I'll take you home.
No. I'll be all right.
You come back here around noon.
Madeleine, where are you now?
- Here with you.
- And it's all real.
It's not merely as it was
100 years ago, or a year ago, or six months ago, or whenever it was you were here to see it.
Now, Madeleine, think of when you were here.
There were not so many carriages then.
There were horses in the stalls.
A bay, two black and a gray.
It was our favorite place.
But we were forbidden to play here.
Sister Teresa would scold us.
Look at this.
Well, here's your gray horse.
Have a little trouble getting in and out of the stall without being pushed, but even so...
You see? There's an answer for everything.
Madeleine, try.
Try for me.
I love you, Madeleine.
I love you, too.
Too late. Too late.
No, no, we're together.
No, it's too late.
There's something I must do.
No. There's nothing you must do.
There's nothing you must do.
No one possesses you.
You're safe with me.
No, it's too late.
Look. It's not fair.
It's too late.
It wasn't supposed to happen this way.
It shouldn't have happened.
It had to happen. We're in love.
That's all that counts.
- Look, let me go. Please let me go!
- Listen to me. Listen to me.
You believe I love you?
Yes.
And if you lose me, then you'll know I...
I loved you and I wanted to go on loving you.
I won't lose you.
Let me go into the church, alone.
But why?
Madeleine!
Madeleine!
Madeleine!
Ferguson.
Mr. Elster, suspecting that all was not well with his wife's mental state, took the preliminary precaution of having her watched by Mr. Ferguson, lest any harm befall her.
And you have heard that
Mr. Elster was prepared to take his wife to an institution, where her mental health would have been in the hands of qualified specialists.
Mr. Ferguson, being an ex-detective, would have seemed the proper choice for the role of watchdog and protector.
As you have learned, it was an unfortunate choice.
However, I think you'll agree that no blame can be attached to the husband.
His delay in putting his wife under medical care was due only to the need for information as to her behavior, which he expected to get from Mr. Ferguson.
He had taken every precaution to protect his wife.
He could not have anticipated that
Mr. Ferguson's weakness, his fear of heights, would make him powerless when he was most needed.
As to Mr. Ferguson, you have heard his former superior,
Detective Captain Hansen, from that great city to the north, testify as to his character and ability.
Captain Hansen was most enthusiastic.
The fact that once before, under similar circumstances,
Mr. Ferguson allowed a police colleague to fall to his death,
Captain Hansen dismissed as an "unfortunate incident."
Of course, Mr. Ferguson is to be congratulated on having once saved the woman's life, when, in a previous fit of aberration, she threw herself into the Bay.
It is a pity that knowing her suicidal tendencies, he did not make a greater effort the second time.
But we are not here to pass judgment on Mr. Ferguson's lack of initiative.
He did nothing.
And the law has little to say on the subject of things left undone.
Nor does his strange behavior after he saw the body fall have any bearing on your verdict.
He did not remain at the scene of the death. He left.
He claims he suffered a mental blackout and knew nothing more until he found himself back in his own apartment in San Francisco several hours later.
You may accept that, or not.
Or you may believe that having once again allowed someone to die, he could not face the tragic result of his own weakness and ran away.
That has nothing to do with your verdict.
It is a matter between him and his own conscience.
Now, from the evidence of the state of mind of Madeleine Elster prior to her death, from the manner of her death, and from the postmortem examination of the body showing the actual cause of her death, you should have no difficulty in reaching your verdict, gentlemen.
You may retire if you wish.
Hold on, Mr. Jones.
We've reached a verdict.
Thank you.
"The jury finds that Madeleine Elster committed suicide
"while of unsound mind."
Your verdict will be so recorded.
Dismissed.
All right, Scottie, let's go.
Mind if I speak to him for a minute?
No, go ahead.
Scottie.
Sorry, Scottie. That was rough.
He had no right to speak to you like that.
It was my responsibility.
I shouldn't have got you involved.
No, there's nothing you have to say to me.
I'm getting out, Scottie, for good.
I can't stay here.
I'm going to wind up her affairs and mine, get away as far as I can.
Europe, perhaps.
And I probably never will come back.
Good-bye, Scottie.
If there's anything I can do for you before I go.
There was no way for them to understand.
You and I know who killed Madeleine.
Come on, Scottie.
Let's get out of here.
It's Mozart, Wolfgang Amadeus.
I had a long talk with that lady in musical therapy, Johnny, and she says that Mozart's the boy for you, the broom that sweeps the cobwebs away.
Well, it's what the lady said.
You know, it's wonderful how they have it all taped now, John.
I have music for dipsomaniacs, and music for melancholiacs, and music for hypochondriacs.
I wonder what would happen if somebody got their files mixed up.
I brought a lot of other things, and you can see what you like.
It shuts off automatically.
Oh, Johnny. Johnny, please try.
Try, Johnny.
You're not lost. Mother is here.
Time?
Okay.
I'll be in again, John.
You want me to shut that off?
Oh, John-O.
You don't even know I'm here, do you?
But I'm here.
Nurse, could I see the doctor for a moment?
Doctor, Miss Wood.
Won't you go in, please?
Yes, Miss Wood?
Doctor, how long is it going to take you to pull him out of this?
Well, it's hard to say.
At least six months. Perhaps a year.
It really could depend on him.
He won't talk.
No. He's suffering from acute melancholia, together with a guilt complex.
He blames himself for what happened to the woman.
We... We know little of what went on before.
Well, I can give you one thing.
He was in love with her.
Oh, that does complicate the problem, doesn't it?
I can give you another complication, he still is.
And you want to know something, Doctor?
I don't think Mozart's going to help at all.
Where'd you get this car?
- I beg your pardon?
- This... This car?
Why, I bought it from a man who used to live here, in this apartment building,
Mr. Gavin Elster.
I bought it from him when he moved away.
Oh, you knew him and his wife.
The poor thing. I didn't know her.
Tell me, is it true that she really...
I'm... I'm sorry.
- Good evening.
- Good evening.
Give me a scotch and soda, will you.
Well, what is it?
Could I ask you a couple of questions?
What for? Who are you?
My name is John Ferguson.
Is this some kind of Gallup poll?
Oh, no.
- There are just couple of things I'd like to ask.
- You live in this hotel?
No. I happened to see you when you came in, so I thought...
Yeah, I thought so. A pickup.
Well, you've got a nerve, following me right into the hotel and up to my room.
Now, you beat it.
Go on and beat it.
No, please, please.
I just want to talk to you.
Listen, I'm gonna yell in a minute.
Listen, I'm not gonna hurt you.
Honest. I promise.
Please. Just let me talk to you.
- What about?
- You.
Why?
Because you remind me of somebody.
I heard that one before, too.
I remind you of someone you used to be madly in love with, but then she ditched you for another guy, and you've been carrying the torch ever since.
Then you saw me and something clicked.
Well, you're not far wrong.
Well, it's not gonna work, so you better go.
Please, let me come in.
You can leave the door open.
I just want to talk to you. Please.
Well, I warn you,
I can yell awful loud.
Now, you won't have to.
Well, you don't look very much like Jack the Ripper.
What do you want to know?
- I want to know your name.
- Judy Barton.
- Who you are?
- I'm just a girl. I work at Magnin's.
No, but, how do you happen to be living here?
It's a place to live, that's all.
No, but you haven't lived here long?
Yeah, about three years.
Well, where did you live before?
Salina, Kansas.
Listen, what is this?
What do you want?
I just want to know who you are.
Well, I told you.
My name is Judy Barton.
I come from Salina, Kansas.
I work at Magnin's, and I live here.
My gosh, do I have to prove it?
All right, mister, my Kansas driver's license.
Judy Barton, number Z296794,
425 Maple Avenue, Salina, Kansas.
See the address on this one?
It's this place right here.
A California license issued May 25, 1954.
You want to check my thumbprints?
You satisfied?
And whether you're satisfied or not, you can just beat it.
Gee, you have got it bad, haven't you?
Do I really look like her?
She's... She's dead, isn't she?
I'm sorry.
And I'm sorry I yelled at you.
Yes, that's me with my mother.
And that's my father.
He's dead.
My mother married again, but I didn't like the guy, so I decided I'd see what it's like in sunny California.
I've been here three years.
Honest.
Will you have dinner with me?
Why?
Well, I just feel that I owe you something after all this.
You don't owe me anything.
Well, then will you? For me?
Dinner and what else?
Just dinner.
'Cause I remind you of her?
Because I'd like to have dinner with you.
Well, I've been on blind dates before.
Matter of fact, to be honest,
I've been picked up before.
Okay.
All right, I'll get my car.
I'll be back for you in half an hour.
Oh, no, you better give me time to change and get fixed up.
An hour?
- Uh-huh.
- Okay.
Dearest Scottie.
And so you found me.
This is the moment that I dreaded and hoped for.
Wondering what I would say and do if I ever saw you again.
I wanted so to see you again, just once.
Now I'll go, and you can give up your search.
I want you to have peace of mind.
You've nothing to blame yourself for.
You were the victim.
I was the tool, and you were the victim of Gavin Elster's plan to murder his wife.
He chose me to play the part because
I looked like her. He dressed me up like her.
It was quite safe because she lived in the country and rarely came to town.
He chose you to be the witness to a suicide.
The Carlotta story was part real, part invented,
to make you testify that Madeleine wanted to kill herself.
He knew of your illness.
He knew you'd never get up the stairs to the tower.
He planned it so well.
He made no mistakes.
I made the mistake.
I fell in love.
That wasn't part of the plan.
I'm still in love with you, and I want you so to love me.
If I had the nerve,
I'd stay and lie,
hoping that I could make you love me again
as I am for myself.
And so forget the other and forget the past.
But I don't know whether
I have the nerve to try.
Oh, here. Here, I'll do it.
There you are.
Thanks again. Good night.
Can I see you tomorrow?
Tomorrow night? Well...
No, I mean tomorrow morning.
But I have to go to work.
I've got a job.
Don't go to your job.
And what'll I live on?
My oil wells in Texas?
Let me take care of you, Judy.
Thanks very much, but no thanks.
No, Judy, you don't understand.
Oh, I understand, all right.
I've been understanding since I was 17.
- And the next step is?
- No, no. No, no.
No? Then what?
We could just see a lot of each other.
Why?
'Cause I remind you of her?
It's not very complimentary.
And nothing else?
No.
That's not very complimentary, either.
I just want to be with you as much as I can, Judy.
Well, I guess I could phone the store in the morning and make some excuse.
There you are.
I like that one.
Like that?
- Yes.
- All right.
Well, that's very nice.
It's beautiful.
There we are.
Now, we'll get this, and then we'll buy you those clothes.
- Honest?
- Right over there's Ransohoffs.
It's the best. How much is that?
That'll be 50 cents. Thank you.
Scottie, you don't have to.
But I want to.
No, that's not it. Nothing like it.
But you said gray, sir.
Now, look. I just want an ordinary, simple gray suit.
But I like that one, Scottie.
No, no. It's not right.
Gentleman seems to know what he wants.
All right. We'll find it.
Scottie, what are you doing?
I'm trying to buy you a suit.
But... But I love the second one she wore.
And this one, it's beautiful.
No, no. They're none of them right.
Oh, I think I know the suit you mean.
We had it some time ago.
Let me go and see.
We may still have that model.
Thank you.
You're looking for the suit that she wore, for me.
You want me to be dressed like her.
Judy, I just want you to look nice.
I know the kind of suit that'd look well on you.
Oh, no. No, I won't do it!
Judy.
Judy, it can't make that much difference to you.
I just want to see...
No, I don't want any clothes. I don't want anything.
I want to get out of here.
Judy, do this for me.
Here we are.
Yes, that's it.
I thought so.
- I don't like it.
- No, we'll take it.
Will the thing fit?
Well, yes. It might need some slight alterations, but it's madam's size.
All right, dear.
We'll have it for you to try on in a moment.
How long will the alterations take?
Well...
May we have it by tonight?
Well, if it's absolutely necessary.
Yes, it is. Now, we'd like to look at a dinner dress, an evening dress.
Short, black, with long sleeves, and a kind of square neck.
Scottie!
My! You certainly do know what you want, sir.
I'll see what we have.
All right. That's it.
Do you have them in brown?
- Yes, we have.
- Fine.
Here, Judy. Drink this straight down, just like medicine.
Stop.
Why are you doing this?
What good will it do?
I don't know.
I don't know. No good, I guess.
I don't know.
I wish you'd leave me alone.
I want to go away.
You can, you know.
No. You wouldn't let me.
And I don't wanna go.
Oh, Judy. Judy, I tell you this.
These past few days have been the first happy days I've known in a year.
I know. I know because...
'Cause I remind you of her.
And not even that very much.
No. No, Judy. Judy, it's you, too.
There's something in you that...
You don't even want to touch me.
Yes. Yes, I do.
Couldn't you like me, just me, the way I am?
When we first started out, it was so good. We had fun.
And... And then you started in on the clothes.
Well, I'll wear the darned clothes if you want me to, if you'll just like me.
The color of your hair.
Oh, no.
Judy, please. It can't matter to you.
If...
If I let you change me, will that do it?
If I do what you tell me, will you love me?
Yes.
- Yes.
- All right.
All right, then, I'll do it.
I don't care anymore about me.
Here, come on. We'll sit by the fire.
I'm afraid it's going to take several hours.
The young lady thought perhaps you'd like to go home.
And then she'll come there as soon as she's finished.
Well, no. You tell her I'll go to her hotel and wait for her there.
Oh, and you're sure about the color of the hair?
Oh, yes. It's an easy color.
- And all the rest of...
- Yes, sir, we know what you want.
Thank you.
Well?
It should be back from your face and pinned at the neck.
I told her that.
I told you that.
We tried it.
It just didn't seem to suit me.
Please, Judy.
Where shall we go for dinner?
Anywhere you like.
Ernie's?
You have a thing about Ernie's, don't you?
Well, after all, it's our place.
Hello, my love. Like me?
Mmm-hmm.
Is that the best you can do?
Come here.
Oh, no. You'll muss me.
Well, that's what I had in mind.
Now, come here.
It's too late. I got my face on.
And I'm suddenly hungry.
Would you rather go somewhere else?
No, no. Ernie's is fine.
I'm gonna have...
I'm gonna have one of those big, beautiful steaks.
Let me see.
To start, I think I'll...
Help me with this, will you?
I have it.
How do you work this thing?
Can't you see?
Oh. Now, there you are.
Thank you. I'm just about ready.
All I've got to do is find my lipstick.
Where did I put it?
I had it a minute ago.
I wonder if it's here.
Here it is.
There, I'm ready.
But first, muss me a little?
Scottie, I do have you now, don't I?
How would you like to go someplace out of town for dinner?
Maybe we could drive down the peninsula.
All right. If you'd like.
We're going awfully far.
I just feel like driving.
You terribly hungry?
No. No, it's all right.
Where're you going?
One final thing I have to do.
And then, I'll be free of the past.
Scottie, why are we here?
I told you.
I have to go back into the past once more.
Just once more, for the last time.
Why? Why here?
Madeleine died here, Judy.
- I don't wanna go. I'd rather wait here.
- No, I need you.
Why?
I need you to be Madeleine for a while.
And when it's done, we'll both be free.
- I'm scared.
- Oh, no. I have to tell you about Madeleine now.
Right there.
We stood there, and I kissed her for the last time.
And she said, "If you lose me,
- "you'll know that I loved you..."
- Scottie.
"and wanted to keep on loving you."
And I said, "I won't lose you."
But I did.
And then she turned and ran into the church.
And when I followed her, it was too late.
I don't wanna go in there!
It's too late.
Scottie, I...
I couldn't find her, and then I heard footsteps on the stairs.
She was running up the tower.
Right here.
- Scottie...
- See? She was running up the stairs, through the trapdoor at the top of the tower.
And I tried to follow her, but I couldn't get to the top.
I tried, but I couldn't get to the top.
One doesn't often get a second chance.
I want to stop being haunted.
You're my second chance, Judy.
You're my second chance.
Take me away!
You look like Madeleine now.
Go up the stairs.
- No!
- Go up the stairs.
Go up the stairs, Judy.
And I'll follow.
This was as far as I could get, but you went on.
Remember?
The necklace, Madeleine.
That was the slip.
I remembered the necklace.
- Let me go!
- No. We're going up the tower, Madeleine.
You can't! You're afraid!
Now, we'll see. We'll see.
This is my second chance.
Scottie, please!
But you knew that day that I wouldn't be able to follow you, didn't you?
Who was up there when you got up there?
Elster and his wife?
- Yes.
- Yes, and she was the one who died.
The real wife, not you.
You were the copy.
You were the counterfeit, weren't you?
- Was she dead or alive when...
- Dead! Dead! He'd broken her neck.
He'd broken her neck.
Wasn't taking any chances, was he?
So, when you got up there, he pushed her off the tower, but it was you that screamed.
Why did you scream?
I wanted to stop it, Scottie.
I ran up to stop it. I...
If you wanted to stop it, why did you scream, since you tricked me so well up to then?
You played the wife very well, Judy.
He made you over, didn't he?
He made you over just like
I made you over, only better.
Not only the clothes and the hair, but the looks, and the manner, and the words, and those beautiful phony trances.
And you jumped into the Bay, didn't you?
I'll bet you're a wonderful swimmer, aren't you? Aren't you?
- Aren't you?
- Yes!
And then what did he do? Did he train you?
Did he rehearse you?
Did he tell you exactly what to do, what to say?
You were a very apt pupil, too, weren't you?
You were a very apt pupil.
Why did you pick on me? Why me?
Your accident! Your accident.
My accident...
I was the setup, wasn't I?
I was the setup.
I was a made-to-order witness. I...
I made it.
- I made it.
- What are you going to do?
We're going up and look at the scene of the crime.
Come on, Judy.
And this is where it happened.
And the two of you hid back there and waited for it to clear, and then you sneaked down and drove into town, is that it?
And then? You were his girl?
Well, what happened to you?
What happened to you?
Did he ditch you?
Oh, Judy, with all of his wife's money, and all that freedom, and that power, and he ditched you.
What a shame.
But he knew he was safe. He knew you couldn't talk.
Did he give you anything?
Some money.
And the necklace, Carlotta's necklace.
And there was where you made your mistake, Judy.
You shouldn't keep souvenirs of a killing.
You shouldn't have been...
You shouldn't have been that sentimental.
I loved you so, Madeleine.
Scottie.
I was safe when you found me.
There was nothing that you could prove.
When I saw you again, I couldn't run away.
I loved you so.
I walked into danger and let you change me because I loved you, and I wanted you.
Oh, Scottie. Oh, Scottie, please.
You loved me. Now, keep me safe.
- Please!
- Too late.
It's too late.
There's no bringing her back.
Please.
- No!
- I heard voices.
God have mercy.
Hello, Matthew, what are you doing here so late?
I came to get the books.
I want to study our accounts.
We've been doing very well lately.
Over 200 paid admissions today.
You call that good Saturday business?
If you weren't so stubborn, we'd be turning them away from here.
Who cares a hang about history in wax?
There are people in the world who love beauty.
But more who want sensation, shock!
Morbidly curious! I won't cater to them.
Their money is as good as anybody else's.
You should have seen them turning them away at that Wax Museum on...
... 23rd Street tonight: The Eden Musée.
The story's the same at
Madame Tussaud's in London.
- If you'd only listened to me...
- I know, Matthew.
I'd put in a Chamber of Horrors:
Murder, torture, executions... scare the life out of people.
I don't care for that kind of patronage!
You're a great artist, a genius sculptor.
I'm an ordinary businessman who wants a quick return on his investment.
I've put $20,000 in this historic peep show of yours.
- I could use that to better advantage.
- All right, Matthew.
I've known for some time you wanted to dissolve our partnership.
- I may be able to accommodate you.
- How?
A friend is bringing Sidney Wallace, the art critic, to see my work tonight.
Wallace is rich, and I think
I might persuade him to buy you out.
That sounds interesting.
- I'll want a profit on my investment.
- Yes, Matthew.
I understand.
You leave everything to me, and I promise you it will be...
- That should be they, now.
- I'll wait in the office.
I've heard of Wallace.
He has a pot of money.
If he likes your stuff, put a stiff price on it.
- Does Jarrod live here?
- Yes, he has a room upstairs.
You'll like him, Sidney.
He speaks your language.
Please come in.
I'm happy to see you, Bruce.
I thought you wouldn't come on such a bad night.
We were delayed.
He had to be at a gallery.
Mr. Sidney Wallace. Professor Jarrod.
- A pleasure.
- For me also, Professor.
That title was bestowed on me when I became an exhibitor.
It has little to do with my real work.
If you come, I will show you what that work is.
The visit of such a distinguished critic... may cause my children to become conceited.
To you, they're wax. But to me, their creator, they live and breathe.
Here we have two great lovers from the past.
Cleopatra, Queen of Egypt, and Mark Antony. Their last meeting.
You'll recall, Antony, believing Cleopatra to be dead... killed himself with his own sword.
When Cleopatra found out what happened, she quickly followed her lover.
You noticed how cleverly the hair is mounted on the scalp?
Yes. How do you do that?
Real hair of the proper color and texture... is pressed into the slightly warmed wax with a scalpel... one hair at a time.
Each wave and curl of the subject's own hair is reproduced.
Here's President Lincoln and his assassin,
John Wilkes Booth... one of my few concessions to the macabre.
That's the best figure of Booth I've ever seen. You almost expect him to speak.
- I wonder what he'd say.
- I'm sure he'd rant a bit.
Even after he shot Lincoln and jumped from the President's box onto the stage... he couldn't resist turning to the audience and taking a bow.
I found him a very stubborn person.
- Stubborn?
- Unbelievably.
For days I argued with this fellow before he posed the way I wanted him to.
- You mean, he talked back to you?
- Of course.
It's not easy to shut an actor's mouth.
These groups are like dimensional paintings of the old masters.
This is not only a great show, it's an art exhibit.
That's what I told you.
Here we have Joan of Arc, a favorite subject of mine.
- I understand that. It's beautifully done.
- Thank you.
I've done her over a dozen times, and still she doesn't complain.
What was wrong with her?
There are no authentic portraits available... so sculptors and painters have to work from models.
I've never found the right one, but I will someday.
It's a shame to race through this exhibit.
These figures should be studied.
You're very kind.
My creations have some merit, I suspect... but in bringing back to life the lovely Marie Antoinette...
I feel I've done my best work.
I've never seen anything so exquisite.
People say they can see my Marie Antoinette breathe... that her breast rises and falls.
Look at her eyes, they follow you wherever you go.
She is very real to me.
You know, her eyes do follow you.
They're made of glass, more's the pity.
The exact size and color of the original.
They're inserted into the sockets from inside... by way of the hollow neck, before the head is attached to the body.
Forgive me, my dear, for discussing your intimate secrets.
I'm sorry. I lose myself at times.
If people knew what you have inside these walls... you couldn't accommodate the crowds.
What you need here is exploitation, more advertising.
- That's what I've been telling him.
- My partner wouldn't agree.
He's not happy here.
He wants to invest in something else.
Would you become a partner in this venture? Would you buy him out?
I might be interested if my lawyers approve and the price is right.
With your support, I'd do wonders.
I'd make any sacrifice.
Unfortunately, I'm leaving for Egypt.
I'm financing some excavations there.
I'll be back in three months, then we can discuss...
You make me very happy.
You intrigue me, Professor.
I believe we'd get along together.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- And I'm grateful to you...
- It's all right.
Thank you for your visit and your encouragement.
I'll see you in three months.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Mr. Wallace is a great art critic, darling.
You heard what he said.
Does he make you happy?
Of course you'd say that.
But I don't care about success.
The world will acknowledge your beauty.
And you, my friends...
Cleopatra, Mark Antony,
Lincoln, Joan of Arc, all of you.
How would it suit you to be famous again?
I know it'll please you, you conceited devil.
It was like you to get yourself shot down in a burning barn.
Couldn't do it without a spotlight, could you?
Do you really hear what they say?
Of course.
A man has to be a little nuts to be a good showman.
The sooner I'm out of it, the better.
You'll be out soon, Matthew.
Mr. Wallace returns from Egypt in three months.
He'll be ready to talk business then.
- I heard him. That's no good for me.
- But, surely...
I want to buy something. It'll pay off in a big way and three months is too late.
What guarantee do I have that he won't go cold on the deal?
- Sorry. It's the best I could do.
- I can do better.
How would you like to split $25,000 with me?
And you call me crazy?
You ever thought of what would happen if we had a fire here?
In the cellar, there are six barrels of wax.
Wax is paraffin based.
It's highly inflammable.
This place would go up like a paint factory.
Burn? Burn all my people?
- Do you think I'm a murderer?
- Stop dreaming.
These dummies are insured for $25,000.
That's $12,500 for each of us.
You'd have money to begin again.
I'd rather die myself than see my friends destroyed.
I won't let you do it, and I'll kill you if you try.
Don't be stupid.
All you have to do is to strike a match and the thing is done.
Yes, my friend was a genius.
A great artist.
Only I could understand him.
We were like that, Cathy. Just like that.
- Couldn't they ever find him after the fire?
- Not a sign of him.
The place burned like a paint factory.
Like a volcano.
He was such an impractical fellow.
But I still loved him.
Had I been there, I might have saved him.
You might have gotten burned yourself.
Yes. Such is life.
No matter how much we lose, we must still go on living.
Was there any insurance on the Wax Museum?
Yes. I had a little difficulty about that.
According to the partnership agreement... the money was to go to the survivor of the others.
The insurance company insists upon proof of my partner's death.
They always want a corpse.
But they settled finally.
This afternoon, in fact.
Certified check. I got it cashed.
The money is in my safe.
- You know what that means, baby?
- No, what?
That little trip
I was talking to you about...
You're such a card!
- How much did you get?
Where would you like to go? Atlantic City?
Niagara Falls.
We can get the license in Buffalo.
- License?
- Yes. You know.
Legitimate.
Why not? It might be fun.
Waiter, my check.
Pull it tighter, Sue.
I want a waist like Anna Held.
If I pull it any tighter, you're not going to be able to breathe.
That's all right.
I don't need much breath, anyway.
As my late friend Matty used to say:
"If a girl don't watch her figure, the men won't."
Wasn't that the man you were to marry?
Yes, but he hung himself instead.
Matty was such a card.
Where is your new friend gonna take you tonight?
The Hoffman House for dinner, and then to a vaudeville show.
- That sounds like fun.
- He's a free spender, all right.
Little bit older than I like 'em, but very distinguished looking.
- Is he nice?
- Awfully nice.
A real gentleman, except when he has had a couple of drinks.
That's to be expected.
I'm moving up.
I'm moving up in the world, honey.
No girl ever hits the jackpot till after she passes 14th Street.
- Is that how it goes?
- Sure.
Look at me.
Not too long ago,
I was down on Delancey Street.
And tonight I'll be right up there among the bright lights on 23rd.
Now, when you get up there tonight, don't drink too much.
Don't worry, I won't.
He keeps trying to pour the liquor into me, but I always manage to keep my head.
After all, now that I'm going regular with a swell...
I got social obligations.
You know how it is when a fella...
No, of course you don't know.
You're not like me. You never could be.
You got all the brains and all I've got is what I've got.
You know, I'm surprised you even talk to me.
What nonsense.
You've been so good to me.
Why not?
A girl needs a friend when she is down on her luck.
Holy smoke! Look at the time.
I've got to hurry.
Did you find a job yet?
No, but they need a hat-check girl at the Silver Slipper... and I've got an appointment with the manager.
I know that fellow. Watch out for him.
- But why? What's the matter with him?
- Nothing much.
- Long as you know how to duck.
- That kind?
Yes.
- Did you eat today?
- I had everything I needed.
To hear you tell it.
- Besides, you're behind in your room rent.
- Mrs. Flannigan will wait for me.
Don't count on that.
The old buzzard almost locked me out once.
There.
If I don't sizzle him tonight,
I might as well give up.
He's picking me up in a hansom cab.
No trolley for him. He is real society.
All I've got is 50 cents.
Buy some dinner with it.
- No, Cathy.
- Come on.
My friend will give me some money tonight and then I'll stake you.
I don't need any mad money.
I never get mad.
Good luck tonight at the Silver Slipper.
And don't forget to duck.
Just a moment, Miss Allen.
- What are you coming in so quietly for?
- I didn't want to disturb anybody.
- Did you get the job?
- No.
- Why not?
- I had trouble with the boss.
You'll get your money.
Cathy promised to lend me some tonight when she comes home.
You better get right up there, then.
Because she's home now.
- Couldn't it wait until tomorrow?
- No, it could not.
If you want to sleep in this house tonight, you get that money.
All right, I'll try.
Cathy, it's Sue. Are you there?
I tell you, the scream came from up there.
Let's look into it.
- Usually there's a policeman at the corner.
- That's why I'm blowing the whistle.
Cabbie!
- What is it, Mother?
- It's Sue.
This is a surprise.
I was just thinking about...
- What happened to you, dear?
- What's wrong?
- Wait a minute.
- What happened?
- Wait a minute.
- What is it?
Cathy Gray, the girl in my rooming house, was murdered tonight.
- What?
- I found her.
The man who killed her was there in the room.
I tried to get away from him.
But he followed me into the street.
No, Scott, please don't go out there.
It's all right, darling. Don't be frightened.
It's all right now, dear. You're safe.
- Who found the body?
- One of my roomers. A friend of Cathy's.
- Sue Allen.
- Which one is Miss Allen?
- She isn't here.
- Where is she?
I don't know. We heard her scream.
When we went looking for her, she was gone.
- Are all your roomers in?
- All but Miss Allen.
Lt. Brennan will want a statement from each one of you.
See that nobody leaves the house.
When I arrived at the rooming house, this girl had been dead for several hours.
The immediate cause of death was strangulation.
The mark of a cord is still on her throat.
My examination indicated she'd probably been given a drug.
- You were right.
- What was it?
Something to make her sleep.
Veronal, perhaps.
I'll know as soon as we hear from the laboratory.
How long would it take for such a drug to work?
That would depend upon how much it was diluted.
It was probably given to her in a drink.
That's how it's usually done.
- Business is slow tonight.
- What?
- Three suicides and two murders...
- And a traffic case since 9:00.
The fellow got hit by an automobile.
I didn't think they go fast enough to hurt anybody.
Give them time.
They're getting better every day.
I hope you like it here, honey.
It's the best we've got.
- What's the matter with this one?
- You'll get used to that.
The embalming fluid makes them jump.
One of the suicides. Just like a woman.
They always have to have the last word.
- Why didn't you tell the police?
- She's doing that.
Last night was the time to do it.
- She was in no condition to come here.
- This is murder, Mrs. Andrews.
The body of Cathy Gray was stolen from the morgue last night.
No.
Why would anyone want to take Cathy's body?
We are as much in the dark as you are.
We had a similar case before.
Matthew Burke.
I read about that.
And Patterson, a Deputy City Attorney disappeared.
We found no trace of him.
We could've laid our hands on that man that you saw last night.
That's the strangest description
I've ever heard.
- No human being can look like that.
- Sure you didn't imagine it?
I did see him.
Just as I described him to you.
He was incredible, but very real.
Could he be the man who took Miss Gray to dinner?
That's impossible.
She told me that he was very good-looking.
That's what the landlady said, it's a man with gray hair.
We have no suspects fitting your description.
If we did, we'd have him in the crazy house.
Don't leave town. Where can we find you?
27 Lafayette Street.
- Miss Allen will stay in our home.
- Make sure of that. She's our only witness.
That's all. Thank you.
How do you do?
I received a letter giving this address and signed Professor Jarrod.
But I know the Professor's dead.
Can you tell me who wrote this letter?
My name is Sidney Wallace.
It's so good...
Forgive me. Shaking hands with me is an unpleasant experience.
My hands are no longer hands.
Sit down, please.
This is Igor. He's a deaf-mute.
He is one of my assistants.
I'm going to open another wax museum under a different name.
- It startled you, seeing me here?
- I thought you were dead.
Jarrod is dead. I am a reincarnation.
When I saw your signature,
I thought somebody was fooling me.
I don't understand how you escaped the fire.
It's a mystery to me, too.
All I can remember is that I tried to get out of my studio.
- I failed at first, but here I am.
- What a frightful experience.
Somehow I made my way to the house of a doctor.
I still have my limbs but they won't bear the weight of my body.
As for my hands, they are no use to me now.
As a sculptor, I can't control them.
But they serve for ordinary functions.
- But you're beginning again?
- With the help of my pupils, yes.
I'm rebuilding my exhibition from the ground up.
I'm going to give the people what they want:
Sensation, horror, shock.
Send them out in the streets to tell their friends... how wonderful it is to be scared to death.
I'll show you one of my subjects.
Do you recall the case of Kemmler, the first man to die in the electric chair?
- Yes.
- Igor is working on a model of his head.
He has a strange obsession, this mute of mine.
Every head he models takes on the shape of his own face.
But in this case I humor him, for he somewhat resembles Kemmler.
Crimes of violence will be reproduced in wax... and exhibited while they are still fresh in the public mind.
What do you think of my scheme?
It will succeed, commercially, though it doesn't sound like you.
- Have you turned your back on beauty?
- No.
But I can no longer create it.
- I never forgot your Marie Antoinette.
- Nor have I.
She will be the leading lady of my new exhibition.
But I must find her first.
- Find her?
- A model, I mean.
Yes, there will be beauty, for contrast, if nothing else.
But each subject must be taken from life.
How can I convince my audience they're alive, if I don't believe it myself?
I have something I think will interest you.
You follow Igor down into the basement.
I have to go my own way.
Here we are. Interesting, isn't it?
One of my pupils is about to dip a body into a bath of wax.
- Body?
- Yes.
The bodies are constructed separately... to exact specifications, of reinforced plaster of Paris.
This is Leon, another one of my pupils.
- Mr. Wallace.
- How do you do?
The wax is melted in the cauldron you see above the vat... liquefied and brought to a boiling point... so that it will distribute itself evenly over the body.
The head and hands, tinted by my own secret process... are attached to the body after it is covered with its skin of wax.
Now watch.
I wondered how it was done.
It's a method of my own.
Crude but adequate.
- Have you found a home for your museum?
- This is it, the building upstairs.
We'll continue to use the cellar as the workshop... it's an excellent location, and the building can be leased at the right price.
I have some capital, but I need more.
$30,000, at least.
That's why I've asked you to come here.
- I'll think it over.
- Good.
She is about right, now.
Leon, drain out the surplus, and let her cool.
Leon, open up number 27.
Come this way, please.
I told you that I intend to exhibit scenes of violence.
Here is an interesting subject.
A mystery they are still talking about.
All right, Leon.
I saw his picture in the papers.
This is a remarkable likeness.
- But it can't be a death mask.
- No, it's from memory.
He hanged himself in an elevator shaft.
Come in, ladies and gentlemen.
See the House of Wax.
See the Chamber of Horrors.
Here's three lovely ladies right over here.
Would you like to see Little Egypt?
Here she is, ladies and gentlemen,
Little Egypt, Queen of the Harem... who danced at the Colombian Exposition in Chicago in 1893.
Is she wax, or is she flesh and blood?
See the world in wax, the Hall of Fame.
The Chamber Of Horrors.
A cultural exhibition that'll enlighten you, amaze you...
- I think I could do that.
- No, you couldn't.
I could, too, if I took my stays off.
Don't do that. Don't talk that way.
Watch it, young lady.
Careful, sir. Keep your head down or I'll tap you on the chin.
Look out.
That's a becoming hat you're wearing.
I wonder if I could clip a flower off it.
Hold steady, now. Don't move your head.
Or you'll lose the powder off your nose.
There is someone with a bag of popcorn.
Close your mouth, it's the bag I'm aiming at.
Not your tonsil. Here she comes.
Look at that, it's in the bag.
See the lovely centers of ancient times, ladies and gentlemen.
Beauties who died and tortured out on the block.
Visit our Chamber of Horrors.
And pass the time of day with notorious murderers... who killed with the rope, the knife, and the axe.
Thrills, chills, a lot of dirt for a price within the reach of all.
I hope you don't think I've gone too far hiring this fellow to bring people in.
- He makes it sound like a sideshow.
- Try him for a week or two.
Once we're established, we won't need that sort of thing.
He looks like a real man.
You'd be surprised.
It's a real man. Sorry.
The historic figures I'm about to show you will be more interesting... when I tell you that their faces were molded from the original death masks... now in the possession of certain European governments.
First, we have Anne Boleyn... second wife of Henry the Vlll, and the mother of Queen Elizabeth.
With the executioner
Henry borrowed from the French king... so that Anne's head would be cleaved from her body without too much pain.
He was a thoughtful husband, Henry.
It was he who invented the short cut to divorce.
A very bad pun, I'm afraid.
Here is another scene of historic violence.
Charlotte Corday and Marat... one of the leaders of the French Revolution.
The lady found him taking a bath, and plunged the knife into his heart.
- Quelle femme terrible!
- What a shocking thing.
Yes, wasn't it? The poor man was dreadfully embarrassed.
The exhibits in this room will be added to... from time to time as various crimes are committed.
You'll read about them in your newspaper... and see them enacted here in waxen tableaux.
By the way, ladies... this is how your ancestor carried his bride across the threshold.
During the French Revolution... a certain doctor invented a labor-saving device... to take the place of a headmen's ax.
So successful was this machine... at cutting off the heads of the French aristocrats... they named it after its creator.
Here it is, the bloody guillotine.
I don't think I can stand it.
Pull yourself together.
Twelve years ago, the electric chair was first used in New York state.
Here we have an authentic reproduction... of the execution of William Kemmler on August 3, in 1890.
Kemmler killed without mercy and 2,000 volts sent him to a higher court.
The torture of the rack. In this case...
Lady Anne Askew, an English noblewoman accused of treason... is being put to the question.
Needless to say, she admitted she was a traitor.
Who wouldn't, under that sort of pressure?
- Is it your corset?
- It's my stomach. It turned over.
Mine turned over, too.
Now, my friends... we have that jolly old gentleman known as the modern Bluebeard.
Like his namesake, he killed not wisely, but too well... and did away with eight wives.
- Smelling salts, ladies? Help yourself.
- Thank you very much.
Next door to him, we have a mystery of more recent date.
Matthew Burke, the stockbroker.
He was found hanged in the elevator shaft of the building where he had his offices.
Was it murder or suicide?
Only time will tell.
"Foul deeds will rise, though all the world o'erwhelm them, to men's eyes."
Thank you.
- You like him?
- He looks exactly like my Uncle Rufus.
They ought to have a policeman like this in the Eden Musée.
- Haven't you been there?
- No.
From what I see in the papers, this museum is even better.
We'll soon find out.
Meet my good friend, Mr. Sidney Wallace.
- Miss Sue Allen.
- A pleasure.
- I heard you were in town.
- You should have looked me up.
I expect great things of Scott.
He's one of our most promising sculptors.
- Has he been working hard?
- He never knows when to stop.
- Sue's been posing for me.
- Indeed, lovely subject.
She's not a professional model.
She's a guest.
Our mothers were great friends.
- Have you been inside?
- Is it exciting?
If anything, too much so.
But I'm sure it'll catch on.
Jarrod, the owner, is a good friend of mine.
You'll be interested in him.
Let's go in, shall we?
- These figures are excellent.
- I thought you'd agree with me.
They're not only well done but they're good theater.
- What do you think?
- I know they are only wax... but they seem so real, just looking at her makes my neck hurt.
Wait till you see the Chamber of Horrors.
I told Jarrod he should have a nurse on duty there.
He lost the use of his hands.
- Who did these figures?
- His pupils, but he supervised the work.
- His is the mastermind.
- Surely knows his anatomy.
Sue, what is it?
- Are you crying?
- What's wrong, Miss Allen?
A dear friend of mine was murdered and I found her.
She means Cathy Gray, the girl whose body was stolen from the morgue.
What made you think of her now?
That's her face. I know every line of it.
I wake up at night and I see it.
I can't get it out of my mind.
Perhaps that's the reason you see a resemblance.
- It's more than a resemblance.
- It's wax, my dear.
I know, but...
But why should it be so like Cathy?
I think I can explain that.
- This is a pleasure.
- You see, Miss Allen...
I heard what the young lady said.
The figure of Joan of Arc is a traditional exhibit in wax museums.
It was completed just in time for our opening tonight.
You're right, my dear.
It is more than a chance resemblance.
When I create an important figure,
I can't take just any face.
I saw pictures of your Cathy Gray in the newspaper.
Her face fascinated me. And here she is.
Immortalized as the victim of an earlier event.
- Do you really think she'd mind?
- No, I don't think she'd mind.
Cathy loved to "dress up" as she called it.
She used to take fancy dresses... and imitate the actresses she saw in the theater.
- I don't think she'd mind.
- Then I'm forgiven?
There's nothing to forgive.
I just don't understand how it can seem so real.
That's the finest compliment
I have ever received. Thank you, my dear.
Did I hear your name correctly,
Scott Andrews?
- Yes, Mr. Jarrod.
- The sculptor I've been telling you about.
Sidney showed me photographs of your work.
He was right. You have great promise.
- What are you doing now?
- I'm doing a head of Miss Allen.
Let me see your hands.
Mine were once like that.
How I envy you.
Would you be interested in some modeling for me, some originals I have in mind?
Yes. I'd be honored.
Good. Come here tomorrow morning, we'll make the arrangements.
I think you'll like it.
I want you to look at this girl.
- With pleasure.
- Who does she remind you of?
I've been wondering about that.
I haven't known her more than 10 minutes but...
... there's something about her face...
That haunts you as the face of my Marie Antoinette has haunted me.
Of course. I should have seen it at once.
- A figure in wax. Mr. Jarrod's greatest work.
- More than wax. She lived.
- You mean I look like she did?
- Exactly as she did.
Once in his lifetime, every artist feels the hand of God... and creates something that comes alive.
So it was with my Marie Antoinette.
And I loved her.
But she is gone now. Horribly destroyed.
Perhaps you would help me to bring her back.
You will come to see me? Soon?
I'd be glad to.
You'll be welcome at any time, no matter what I'm doing.
- And you, Mr. Andrews, in the morning...
- I'll be here, very eager to begin.
It has been a very exciting day for me and I'm a little tired.
So if you'll forgive me, I'll say good night.
Sidney, one moment, please.
Excuse me, I'll be right back.
Forget about it.
You heard what Mr. Jarrod said.
Cathy's face was inspiration.
It's a portrait in wax.
Why should it seem so real?
I hate to drag you away.
That's fine. I'm going to work here.
We'll see it all another time.
Yes, another time.
Still time to see the entire exhibition, ladies and gentlemen.
Get your tickets from the fine little lady in the box office and go right in.
See the world in wax and improve your mind.
See the Chamber of Horrors and scare yourself out of a year's growth.
Not again.
What happened? Why did you scream?
I saw Cathy again.
And the man who killed her was right here in this room.
I must have been dreaming.
Of course you were, dear.
A lager for the gentleman.
Sarsaparilla for the lady.
- And two knockwurst on rye.
- Thank you.
- Enjoying yourself?
- It's exciting.
- Do nice people come here?
- Of course.
- These Sunday matinees are very popular.
- I don't know.
It doesn't seem proper, all those girls showing their talents.
You never saw a show like this in Provincetown?
Don't worry, your reputation is safe.
You've been worrying too much... about wax figures and seeing monsters in your dreams.
You need something like this to bring you back to normalcy.
Prosit!
Remember Mr. Jarrod said he first saw
Cathy's picture in the newspaper.
Yes. What's wrong with that?
I knew her so well.
I knew every little expression and they are all there.
They would be. The man's an artist.
There's something else I saw that night in the museum.
Cathy had a habit of wearing an earring in her right ear.
She had the lobe of her right ear only pierced for that.
But that's there, too.
How could he see that in a photograph?
- How can he make it so real unless...
- What?
Unless it is Cathy.
I'm going to take you to Lt. Brennan's office tomorrow.
Tell him exactly what you told me here.
He's a policeman, he knows.
He'll convince you once and for all that no such thing could happen.
Now relax, honey, and enjoy the show.
I know it sounds fantastic, but you asked me to tell you everything.
You can see this idea is an obsession, an unhealthy one, if you ask me.
- You say Jarrod is a cripple?
- He uses a wheelchair.
He can walk with crutches, but not very well.
Such a man came and asked to see police photographs of Cathy Gray.
That's how it's done. Every detail is studied to make the features true to life.
But why should Joan of Arc have her right ear pierced?
- Why not? They wore them then.
- Two, not one.
Lieutenant, it's not a suspicion.
It's more a kind of fear, an intuition.
Intuition isn't much help in police work.
Facts are what we need.
Suppose you forget about it, and let us do the worrying.
You mean you'll investigate it?
- Of course he does.
- Yes, that's what I mean.
- You both think I'm crazy.
- We think nothing of the kind.
It was very good of you to listen and be so patient. Thank you.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
Thanks.
This is Brennan speaking. Give me Shane.
Hello. I want you to go to the City License Bureau... and check up on a man named Henry Jarrod.
Yes, he opened a museum on 29th Street, near Broadway.
Yes, The House of Wax.
Dig up all you can. Get a list of his employees and check with me here.
That's a copy of her face, all right.
But she didn't look like that when I saw her.
- Not so composed.
- Poor kid.
You know, this fellow Jarrod's good.
- You think Miss Allen's fears are justified?
- Heck, no. Do you?
That's wax, how could it be anything else?
Leave it to a skirt to dream up a crazy idea like that.
So you did come to see me, my Marie Antoinette?
Or was it that you came to see?
Mr. Jarrod, I'm so sorry. I know
I'm not supposed to touch the figures.
You couldn't help yourself.
Don't let it trouble you.
I beg your pardon, this is Leon Averill and Igor.
- How do you do?
- Igor isn't impolite. He simply can't talk.
Leon is an artist in his own right.
It was he who did the waxwork on the figure of Joan of Arc.
- Does she still seem real to you?
- As life itself.
Of course, her hair is different, but that doesn't change her face.
What puzzles me is how you can get such detail from a photo.
Was Cathy wearing her earrings when the police photographed her?
Earrings? I don't remember.
Was she, Leon?
No. I don't think so.
The police would remove the jewelry from the body, wouldn't they?
Yet you were careful to show that both her ears had been pierced for them.
Yes, of course.
If I missed a detail of that sort,
Mr. Jarrod would be most displeased.
He insists on reality.
I can understand that.
Just a moment, Leon.
There's something in this box
I think would interest you. Open it, Leon.
Your Mr. Andrews permitted us to make a cast of the head he did of you.
Leon has just finished it in wax.
Do you like it?
It's sort of a shock to see your head detached that way.
- I guess it's a very good likeness.
- Yes, and no.
Andrews is clever, but like all modern sculptors... he has too much imagination.
He would improve on nature.
What I need for my Marie Antoinette is you.
The real you.
Nothing less will satisfy me.
Will you come to see me again, my dear?
You know this fellow Jarrod's quicker at finding these guys than we are?
That's what he says in his advertising.
Look at that. Even the twist in the neck.
That's a case that gets me.
Where is Burke? Who got him?
- Who'd want him?
- We better find out pretty quick.
- Did you read the blast in today's World?
- Yeah, it's dynamite.
The Chief had me in his office this morning.
If I'm not careful,
I'll be pounding a beat in the Bronx.
Come here, Jim.
Do you remember Patterson, the
Deputy City Attorney who disappeared?
Sure.
Does Booth look like Wilbur, or am I crazy?
He does a tad with the brush off his lip.
The hair is different, of course, but the features are like Patterson's.
Maybe he looked like Booth. I've seen dummies that look like people I know.
The caveman is a spitting image of the new Commissioner.
Please. Don't touch the exhibits.
- Can't you read the sign?
- I'm sorry.
Look, where'd you get the face for this guy that shot Lincoln?
- From photographs.
- They take them at that time?
If you go to the City Library... you'll find the volume of Mathew Brady's photos taken during the Civil War.
- Do you work here?
- Yeah.
- You make these things?
- Some of them.
What's your name?
Leon Averill. What's yours?
Jim Shane. I'm an engineer on the
9th Avenue El. It was nice meeting you.
You know me. I'm no good at names, but I don't forget faces.
If I can take the muff off of that one
I might be able to place it.
It was a long time ago.
Mr. Wallace, I'm Lt. Brennan. Sgt. Shane.
- Glad to know you.
- Won't you sit down?
- Sorry I kept you waiting.
- That's all right.
This is the first time I've been asked to come to Police Headquarters.
What am I suspected of?
Nothing. We thought perhaps you might be able to help us.
We heard that your partner is the same Professor Jarrod... whose museum on 24th Street burned down some time ago.
That's true.
This Professor Jarrod was supposed to have been killed in the fire.
- Apparently, a slight mistake.
- You suspect him of some criminal act?
- We haven't a thing on him.
- We're curious.
So is the insurance company.
What do you know about his employees?
- There's Scott Andrews, a protégé of mine.
- Yes, we know of him.
Then there's Igor, deaf-mute, and Leon Averill, who does the wax work.
Averill's an odd character.
Periodical drunkard, but a fine artist.
I've seen some of his sketches.
One of the Savior with his disciples.
Beautiful work.
- I'm afraid I haven't been much help.
- You never can tell. Thank you.
- Please don't mention this to your partner.
- I won't.
You know, I gamble on Jarrod.
He's strange, unpredictable, but I think he's a man of integrity.
- I'm sure of it. Thank you very much.
- Not at all. Good day, gentlemen.
Remember I told you
I knew the man with the whiskers?
Do you remember that artist in Sing Sing who painted The Last Supper on his cell?
Hendricks. They called him a genius and gave him a parole.
But when they turned him loose, he became a drunk.
He broke parole a year ago.
We've had him on the wanted list since.
- Carl Hendricks?
- That's him. Alias, Leon Averill.
- Bring him in.
- Can do.
A little more bitterness in that face, my boy.
Remember, this fellow has been badly used by the world... and he despises all the people in it.
Deepen those lines around the corner of the mouth.
Not too much.
There. That's better.
What I wouldn't give to have those fingers of yours.
- Thank you, Mr. Jarrod.
- I'm sorry I kept you so late tonight, Scott.
That's all right.
Miss Allen is meeting me here.
It's her birthday.
We're going to celebrate at Chiles'.
Charming creature.
I was worried. The shock of finding that murdered girl gave her strange ideas.
I know.
I took her to Lt. Brennan, he set her right.
That's very good now. Excellent.
Before you go, would you mind running over to Metzgers for me?
- Metzgers?
- Where they make the artificial flowers.
They're doing a background for this new group. Take a look at it.
You know what I want.
Advise them on the color scheme.
I'd go myself, but it's so hard for me to get about.
I know. I'll be glad to do it.
I'll go right now.
Thank you very much.
I followed him through his bender.
Sometimes, he gets the shakes so bad, you expect to see his teeth fall off.
- Is this all he had on him?
- Yes.
No money?
Gold.
"To Wilbur Patterson...
"With affection and admiration.
"City Attorney's Office.
December 25, 1900."
Where did you get this?
- I found it.
- Where?
- On the El.
- What line?
- Third Avenue, downtown.
- When?
I don't remember, it was months ago.
- Book him on suspicion of murder.
- No. I found that.
I never knew the man who owned it.
I never saw him.
Lock him up.
Please don't put me in a cell. I'm sick.
Can't you see my nerves are all shattered?
Look, please give me one little...
Can I have one little drink...
You're not going to get anything until you tell us where you got this watch.
- Take him out.
- Let's go.
You shouldn't have done that, my dear.
It is Cathy.
It's Cathy's body under the wax.
I knew it. I knew it all the time.
Everything I ever loved has been taken away from me.
Not you, my Marie Antoinette, for I will give you eternal life.
This is where I recreated my Joan of Arc.
It's an interesting process.
If you have patience with me, my dear,
I'll show you how it's done.
I can't stand it.
All right.
All right, I'll tell you what I know.
Patterson was killed because he looked like Booth.
- You killed him.
- No, not I. Jarrod, at the waxworks.
His hands were no good.
He had to take subjects from life.
- You helped him?
- No, they were already dead.
What about Burke?
He's there, too. In wax.
He was the one who set fire to the old museum.
Jarrod came out of it alive, but insane.
- Cathy Gray?
- Joan of Arc. That's Cathy.
She's there with all the rest of them.
The whole place is a morgue.
He'll do the same to Sue Allen, if he gets his hands on her.
You've got to stop him before he does any more killing.
That look of horror spoils your lovely face.
What if it should show, even through the wax?
Are you in there?
Where's Sue?
Where is she?
The end will come quickly, my love.
There's a pain beyond pain, an agony so intense... it shocks the mind into instant oblivion.
We'll find immortality together... for they'll remember me through you.
Where's Jarrod?
Andrews, where's Jarrod?
In the cellar. He's got Sue.
Take care of him.
The People's Exhibit Number One.
You almost lost your head. Would you care to keep that one as a spare?
No, thank you.
We'll never forget you and your men.
Thanks to you, we're still alive.
But every time I shave,
I can still feel that guillotine blade.
- Please, let's not talk about it anymore.
- Yes, you're right.
Mr. Brennan, thank you for the use of your coat.
- That was nothing.
- It meant a lot to me.
When I found you weren't dressed too warmly...
I didn't want you to catch a cold.
Goodbye, Mr. Brennan, and thanks for everything.
- Bless you, Mr. Shane.
- Thank you, Miss Allen.
By the time this guy gets out of Sing Sing... this head will grow a long beard.

In the old days, when I was a child, they used to hang our murderers at the Four Turnings Crossroads.
This is what one moment of passion can bring on a man, Philip.
For as long as I can remember, old Tom was never anything but dull and honest.
But whatever the cause, one day there came a moment of uncontrollable anger, and when it was over, this is what he had earned for himself.
For this is the price for murder.
That was 15 years ago.
I should have remembered his words.
Death is the price for murder.
My entire life has been spent on the Cornish coast of England.
There, for more than a hundred years, has stood the solid, comfortable home in which I grew up from infancy in the care of my cousin Ambrose.
- What is it?
- Open it.
Happy birthday, dear boy.
My parents died when I was but a few months old.
From then on, as long as he lived,
Ambrose was not only my kinsman and guardian but father, brother, friend, everything in the world to me.
And just two years ago, on the stormiest night that I can remember, distant bells began to toll for him.
And now they tell me if I spend another winter in this blasted rain,
I'll end up a cripple in a Basque chair.
So I must go and search for the sun, I suppose.
- Where will you go?
- Italy, perhaps.
Somewhere on the Mediterranean.
Well, uh, you'll want me to go with you, won't you?
I'd want you, of course, but I don't think both of us should be away from here at the same time.
You don't think you'll need someone to help you in and out of carriages
- and all that sort of thing?
- Good heavens, no.
I'm not exactly an invalid yet.
The only real trouble is
I'm too much of a fool about my home.
I hate to leave it even for a week, and, well, this must be for months.
And so today, the Four Turnings Crossroads is an even uglier place to me.
For it was there that I bade him farewell for the last time.
This is far enough. You don't want to be late getting back.
Good-bye, dear boy.
Good-bye, Ambrose.
- Good-bye, Louisia.
- Good-bye.
You'd better keep an eye on this one, don't you think?
She's coming along pretty fast now.
Never mind about me.
What we want to know is who's going to keep an eye on you?
What did I tell you?
Drive on.
Good-bye, children.
- I'll see you in the spring.
- Good-bye, Ambrose.
Good-bye, Ambrose.
God bless you.
But when winter had passed and we were well into spring again, and still there was no sign of his returning,
I came to be troubled by strange and formless fears, wholly without reason but persistent and nagging, and in some ways ominous.
Good morning.
Nick.
What news from our tourist now?
Still in Florence.
Can't seem to tear himself away from some people he's met there.
Oh? Who are they?
You ever heard of a family from these parts named Corin, one of them once married to a member of our family?
Oh, yes, I remember the Corins. Why?
He writes that he's met one of them in Florence.
A Countess Sangaletti.
Half English, half Italian, a widow.
How old is she?
He doesn't say, but middle-aged, I suppose, married and widowed and so on.
She's been showing him the gardens in Florence.
When's he coming home?
Didn't even mention it this time.
Is it really true, sir?
It is.
- What is it, dear?
- Where's your father?
Here I am.
What's the trouble?
Another letter.
I want you to hear it yourself.
"My dearest boy, all is not well with me.
Better keep silent though she watches me all the time.
I have written to you several times, but there is no one here I trust, and unless I can get out myself to post the letters, they may not reach you.
Since my illness, this has been more difficult than ever.
As for the doctors,
I have no belief in any of them.
They're all liars, and the new one recommended by her friend Rainaldi
I'm sure is a complete cutthroat, but then he would be, coming from that quarter.
However, they have taken on a dangerous proposition in me, and I will beat them yet. Ambrose."
Look at the writing.
I can't believe it.
Can't believe what?
It's not the letter of a man in his right senses.
That's not it.
There have been hints before in exactly the same tone.
There is nothing the matter with Ambrose's mind.
You may not know this, but Ambrose's father died of a tumor on the brain.
It was never a matter much discussed in the family.
I have no idea whether these things are hereditary or not, nor do the doctors seem to know.
The only other possibility
I can think of, and one which I would infinitely prefer, is that Ambrose was drunk when he wrote this letter.
I've never seen Ambrose drunk in my life.
Nor I. I was merely trying to choose the better of two evils.
Well, whatever the truth, we'll know it soon.
I'm leaving for Florence first thing tomorrow morning.
Pull up a minute, please.
Whoa.
- Isn't that the post bag?
- Yes, sir.
- Let me see the letters, please.
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.
- Thank you, sir.
- Drive on.
Villa Sangaletti?
Si.
Signor Ashley. Is he here?
No, no, signore.
Then, uh, Signora Ashley.
Excuse me.
Un momento, signore.
- Do you understand English?
- Yes, signore.
Will you be good enough to announce me to Mr. Ambrose Ashley?
Excuse me, signore, but you are Mr. Ashley's son?
No. His cousin.
Is he here or not?
I am very sorry, signore, but he's not.
He's dead.
Since three weeks now.
Would you care for a glass of wine, signore?
No.
Thank you.
How did he die?
From the fever, signore.
I mean, was it quick or― or slow?
The illness was long and slow, but the end was quick.
He fell asleep, truly.
You saw him?
Yes, signore.
It was very early in the morning, and Signore Rainaldi send me for the doctor, but it was too late.
I myself helped the contessa to light the candles.
And when the nuns had gone,
I went back to look at him again.
The violence had all gone now, and on his face there was a look of peace.
What do you mean by violence?
During the fever, signore, there were many times
I had to hold him down in bed when the attacks came on.
And when the pain went, he would be dazed and heavy, his mind wandering.
That was the way it was the whole winter.
A strong man as helpless at last as a child.
And, uh, Mrs. Ashley... she's still here?
No, signore.
She moved out the day after the funeral.
Signore Rainaldi thought it best.
Mr. Ashley's things?
- She packed them all up and―
- What about this?
She must have overlooked it, signore.
I see.
And if there's no objection,
I'll take it along for myself.
Of course, signore.
And this Signor Rainaldi.
You say he was of great help and comfort to Mrs. Ashley during her... ordeal.
He never left the villa during that entire week.
He was their true friend as well as lawyer.
Where can I find him now?
In the rear verona, signore.
It's the first house on the left after the fountain.
Thank you.
Is this Signor Rainaldi's?
No, thank you.
A vanti.
Mr. Ashley?
Yes.
Philip Ashley.
Kinsman of Ambrose.
I can see the resemblance.
Will you have a chair, sir?
I've just come from the Villa Sangaletti, Mr. Rainaldi.
I know.
You have Ambrose's stick.
You have no objection, I trust.
How could I? It would have been sent to you anyway.
It was in that empty house, and from the lips of a servant that I first learned of the death of my cousin.
I regret the circumstances,
I assure you.
Why was I not informed at least of his illness?
Your cousin's death was quite sudden, Mr. Ashley.
Not so sudden, apparently, that he hadn't time to write me these letters.
Yes, she was afraid he might have written something like this.
The doctors warned her he might.
Why did they warn her?
Because of his behavior, which became quite strange and secretive during those last few weeks.
But without reason, of course.
On the contrary.
For a very good reason.
The tumor, they said, was beginning to press on his brain.
They said he had a tumor?
That was the cause of his death.
May I ask what proof there is of that?
Certainly.
This is a copy of the certificate of death, signed by both doctors.
A second copy was posted to you at the time, and a third to the trustee of your cousin's will,
Mr. Nicholas Kendall in Cornwall.
How did you know that Mr. Kendall was the trustee of his will?
I read it in the will.
- You read my cousin's will?
- Certainly. He showed it to me.
May I ask how he disposed of the estate?
In effect, to you.
All of it?
In trust, I believe, until your 25th birthday.
What about her?
There was no mention of Mrs. Ashley in the will filed for probate.
She'll take action, of course, to break it.
On the contrary.
I have already written Mr. Kendall her entire approval of its terms.
I wish I could say that your... explanation of his illness satisfied me.
But it doesn't.
Regardless of those doctors, regardless of that paper, those are not the letters of a man simply sick.
They are the letters of a man in danger, surrounded by enemies.
Sick not only in body but in mind, too, remember.
He was failing fast.
What of this?
"She has done for me at last,
Rachel, my torment."
What explanation do you have for that?
Are you any sort of student of medical history, Mr. Ashley?
Of course not.
There is a particular affliction of the brain in the case of a tumor of similar growth, which results in the sufferers becoming troubled with delusions.
"He fancies, for instance, that he's being watched, that the person nearest to him, such as his wife, has either turned against him or is unfaithful, or seeks to take his money.
No amount of love or persuasion can relieve him of this suspicion once it takes hold."
If you don't believe me or this book, which you may take with you, ask an English doctor.
Your own, perhaps.
Why didn't she send for me?
If Ambrose had lost faith in her, why not send for the one closest to him?
- You're very young, aren't you―
- My age is not the question here!
Why was I not sent for at once?
I wished only to make the point that I am older than you and have probably had more experience with women.
The contessa is a woman of very strong feelings, and such women do not acknowledge defeat easily.
They cling to the things they want.
They never surrender, actually.
Where is she now?
I have no idea.
She left Florence yesterday without telling me where she was bound.
When she wishes me to know where she is, she will write to me.
Is there anything more
I may do for you while you are here?
No, thank you.
If you wish to see the grave before you leave, it's in the Protestant cemetery.
The stone ordered by Mrs. Ashley is already in place, I believe.
When she returns, tell her I was here.
Tell her for me I went to the villa and heard how Ambrose died.
And tell her also about the letters he wrote to me.
I will, if she returns.
But Mrs. Ashley is also a woman of impulse, and there's no assurance that she will ever come back to Florence again.
Good day, sir.
And there, beside his grave, I made a vow.
I swore that whatever it had cost
Ambrose in pain and suffering,
I would return it in full measure, because I did not believe
Rainaldi's story.
I believed in the truth of those two letters that I held in my right hand.
Someday, somehow,
I would repay my cousin Rachel.
I must say, you're a great deal prompter than I've been accustomed to with you.
We raced.
It's the only way to get him anywhere on time.
- Will you be long?
- I don't think so.
Then if you'll excuse me,
I'll change and we'll have some tea.
- Such mystery.
- Don't look at me.
I don't know what it is.
Well?
Philip,
I've odd news for you.
Yes?
Mrs. Ashley is here.
- In this house?
- In Plymouth.
She arrived by ship two days ago.
She writes to tell me of Ambrose's death.
Apparently, she knows nothing of your visit to Florence.
I think you should read it.
I think it will impress you.
What's she after?
- A settlement?
- No. She only wants to return the remainder of Ambrose's possessions: his books, his papers, old clothes.
She wants to bring them here herself, I suppose.
To judge from this letter and the one from Rainaldi last week, she wants nothing more of us, not one shilling.
Although I believe that as the widow, she might quite properly make some kind of claim on the estate.
Claim? After driving him to his death?
That's a very foolish thing to say, Philip, and I wouldn't repeat it if I were you.
If ever she heard such a charge, she would be well within her rights to bring a case against you for slander.
Well within her rights.
If Ambrose had thought she deserved it, he'd have left his wife something― the whole estate, in fact, and you know it.
Unless he was too ill to recognize his obligations.
Surely you don't believe that story of the tumor.
I do now, yes.
Here is her account.
Here is Rainaldi's.
Here is the death certificate.
In addition to which, I remember
Ambrose's father's death.
The symptoms were quite similar.
Well, you may, but I don't, not for a minute.
You mean you won't.
She doesn't even ask to see the house― the house that would have been her home had Ambrose lived.
Instead of which, a lonely hostelry in Plymouth.
You touch me, Nick.
I'm sorry, Phillip, but as Ambrose's friend,
I can't sit here and do nothing when his widow arrives alone and friendless in this country.
I shall invite her to come here and stay with us until her plans are formed.
I know you won't want to see her, so if she accepts my invitation,
I won't ask you over while she's here.
On the contrary.
I'd like very much to see her.
Perhaps you'll write that to her.
Tell her that Philip Ashley is rather a plain man living in rather a plain fashion with no fine manners whatsoever.
But if she wishes to see him and her late husband's home, the house will be completely at her disposal whenever she cares to visit.
Do you think for one moment she'd accept an invitation like that?
Send it along.
We'll see whether she will or not.
Welcome, Mrs. Ashley.
Thank you, Seecombe.
She's come, sir.
She was due here at 5, and it's now nearly 7.
I should hope she had.
Did you explain that I was too busy to be here to greet her?
She said she understood, sir.
Where is she now?
In her room, sir.
Am I to understand that she's already dined without waiting for me?
Oh, no, sir.
She had a tray in her room.
She was very tired after the journey and asked that you excuse her this evening.
She told me to tell you, sir, that if you wish to see her after dinner, she'd be pleased to receive you.
- In her room?
- Yes, sir.
Thank you.
Come in.
Good evening.
Oh, I'm―
How are you, Philip?
I , uh, hope you feel better now.
Very much, thank you.
Will you sit with me for a few minutes?
I owe you an apology for not coming down to dinner after you'd gone to so much trouble to make the house bright and beautiful for me, but I was very tired and dull.
It's quite all right.
I understand.
I do hope you didn't hurry home before you should have.
No, the, uh, work was all quite done.
You mustn't, believe me, make any kind of alteration in your days because of me.
I just wanted to say one thing, which is, thank you, Philip, for letting me come.
It can't have been easy for you.
You're quite welcome, I'm sure.
You have no idea what a strange feeling it was driving through the park and up to the house with Seecombe standing by the door to greet me.
Everything was just as I'd imagined it― the hall, the pictures, even the clock striking 4 as I came in the door.
Was Don really 14 on his last birthday?
Yes. His birthday is a few weeks before my own.
I know.
You found him in a pie with your breakfast.
Ambrose watched you open it from behind a screen in the dining room.
He said he'd never forget the look of amazement on your face when you lifted the crust and a puppy struggled out.
What an amazing thing for you to know.
I probably know a good many more things about you than you'd ever imagine.
Yes?
Thank you, Seecombe.
Shall I take the dog out now, ma'am?
I suppose so.
Come on, Don.
What about breakfast, ma'am?
Mr. Philip has his in the dining room at 8:00.
Would it be too much trouble for me to have mine in my room?
Not at all, ma'am.
I'll ring when I'm awake.
Very good, ma'am.
Will there be anything else?
No, thank you.
Good night.
Good night, ma'am.
Good night, sir.
Ambrose used to say no woman was fit to look at before 11.
Would you like a cup?
I can hardly believe it.
- Believe what?
- My eyes.
I've never seen Seecombe serve tea before in my life.
He did it very well, don't you think?
I'll tell you something else.
I've never seen this tray before.
Nor the teapot nor the kettle.
I didn't think you had.
I saw that look on your face when he entered.
And I'll tell you something else too.
- What?
- I don't think he'd ever seen them before either.
That butter's melting.
You'd better lick your fingers.
Oh. Oh, thank you.
Would you like to smoke now?
In here?
If you'd like to.
Well, I , uh, I would indeed, but when Mrs. Pascoe comes, we don't even smoke in the drawing room.
But this is not a drawing room.
It's a boudoir, and I'm not Mrs. Pascoe.
Oh... I thought women minded about such things.
Oh, they do when they've nothing better to worry about.
This was Aunt Phoebe's room, wasn't it?
Was it?
Before you were born.
It may have been.
All I remember of Aunt Phoebe is simply her name.
Ambrose never told you of her great romance?
Why, no.
Aunt Phoebe fell lovesick of the curate and went away to Tunbridge to mend her broken heart.
But the heart proved stubborn, and Aunt Phoebe took a chill that lasted 20 years.
Are you sure you haven't heard of this?
Never. What happened then?
The chill left her after 20 years after the sight of another curate, but by then she was 5 and 40, and her heart was not so brittle, so she married the second curate.
And, uh, was the marriage a success?
No. As a matter of fact, she died on her wedding night.
But I think I'd better not tell you the circumstances until we've known each other a little longer.

May the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be always acceptable in Thy sight, O Lord, my strength...
I remember, too, another custom he was fond of:
Sunday luncheon with the Kendalls and the Pascoes, and I wonder, with Philip's permission, if we mightn't enjoy it together today.
Will you join us?
Oh, we shall be delighted.
And if Louise would be willing to drive back with Philip, perhaps Ambrose's oldest friend would invite me to ride with him in his carriage.
Nothing would give me greater happiness, Mrs. Ashley.
Thank you, Mr. Kendall.
We'll see you soon then.
- Will you?
- Oh, dear me, indeed.
Well, what did she say?
About what?
Didn't you charge her?
Not yet.
Haven't you said anything at all to her about the way he died?
No, I haven't had the right opportunity.
But I thought that's why you invited her here.
It is, and I intend to at the right moment.
She's not at all the sort of person
I thought she'd be.
You can see that for yourself.
She's very beautiful.
Do you really think so?
But middle-aged, of course.
Quite 35, I should say.
Wouldn't you?
I have no idea and care less.
She could be 99 for all I know.
Ninety-nine women don't have eyes like that, or that complexion.
Nor do they dress like that, or look so well in mourning.
I love the stillness of a room after a party, don't you?
You weren't bored?
They couldn't have been pleasanter.
And your Louise is charming.
She'll make you an excellent wife.
Louise is a dear, but she's not mine.
She's still only a child, you know.
At your age, I suppose you'd think that.
- Are you teasing me?
- Not in the least.
It's just that I'm very happy.
It's been a wonderful visit, Philip.
- It's not over, is it?
- But of course.
I came only for the weekend.
You forget I have a new life to make for myself.
Why did he never make another will?
Do you know?
What does that matter now?
The fact remains that I can't afford to be idle.
I must look for work of some kind.
In London, I suppose.
But you'll invite me down again, won't you?
I don't know.
You don't know?
I mean I don't know whether you'll want to come again or not.
I'm afraid I haven't been altogether honest with you.
How do you mean?
I should have told you, I suppose, that Ambrose wrote to me during his illness.
Did you know that?
No.
He wanted me―
He begged me to come to Florence to help him.
But I arrived there too late.
You've been to Florence?
Yes.
When? How long ago?
I spent one night there.
The night of August the 15th.
The night after I left.
So Rainaldi told me.
Why didn't you tell me?
Why have you let me stay here two days without mentioning such a thing?
I thought at first you knew.
And...
What did he tell you?
I think you should read them yourself.
The long one came first, then the short one.
- Only these two?
- That's all.
How you must have hated me.
Yes.
Why did you ask me here?
To accuse you.
Of what?
I'm not sure.
Perhaps of breaking his heart, which would be murder, wouldn't it?
And then?
I hadn't planned beyond that.
I knew only that I wanted to make you suffer and to watch you while you suffered.
Then I suppose to― to let you go.
That was merciful of you.
More merciful than I should deserve.
If that was what you wanted, watch me.
Watch me now.
Watch me as much as you wish.
Please stop.
Please!
That's no use, either, when we both remember what he wrote.
I can forget, if you will.
But why should you?
How do you know different?
Because you are not that woman.
You are not the woman I hated.
That was someone who existed only in his poor, sick mind.
That's very generous of you, Philip.
I was a fool.
No, not at all.
Someday when I'm not so tired,
I'd like to tell you about it― about Ambrose and myself and our marriage― as much of it as I understand anyway.
I'd never even met a man like this― strong, tender, without conceit of any kind.
And for the first time in my life,
I knew what peace was.
And as for him, he was like someone sleeping who'd wakened suddenly and found the world with all its beauty and sadness too.
Guido Rainaldi, whom he detested as much as you probably do,
Guido told me once that Ambrose wakened to me as some men waken to religion.
But a woman, unhappily, is not religion.
She's a human being with human thoughts, and she shouldn't be judged by the same rules.
He expected too much of you?
A halo can be a lovely thing, but you must be able to take it off now and again and be human occasionally.
In any case, finding religion doesn't always improve a person.
And waking to the world didn't help Ambrose.
He changed.
His nature changed.
How?
That's a question I wish from the bottom of my heart I could answer.
The doctor said it was his illness, that out of pain and fear these deep hidden thoughts and suspicions came at long last to the surface.
But how can I be sure that it wasn't something in me that brought them out?
Will you get a candle and light me upstairs?
Of course.
Thank you.
You're quite sure you don't hate me now?
Why should I?
I'm very glad,
Philip.
Good night.
She's penniless, I'm sure.
That Italian friend of hers was a little vague about it, but Ambrose wrote, if you remember, that everything she possessed, including the villa, would have to be sold to pay off Sangaletti's debts.
She's certainly entitled to something.
How much would you suggest?
£5,000 a year.
To be paid to her quarterly from the day of Ambrose's death.
You don't think that's a trifle over-generous?
How can one be over-generous with property that might have been due her anyway?
Very well. If you insist.
I'll direct the bank to make the payments.
A sum like that―
It's almost better than being mentioned in the will.
To my distant, but very dear, cousin.
To mine, with a heart full of love and gratitude.
And now.
Before the others arrive.
Merry Christmas, dear Rachel.
Now?
If you will.
Philip, darling.
Put it on.
It's the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen in my life.
Thank you, darling.

Philip, I've had a communication from the bank which I find decidedly disturbing.
Yes?
It seems that in less than three months, your cousin Rachel has overdrawn her account more than double.
Well?
You don't regard that as an extraordinary situation?
Why should I?
What she does with her money is no affair of ours.
Well, I do.
And the only explanation
I can find is that she's sending the money out of the country.
Whatever she does with it, the only important point is that, obviously, what we gave her was not enough.
- That's ridiculous.
- We know she had debts.
We know she's a generous woman.
I want you to increase her allowance at once, and in addition to issue a check to cover that overdraft.
Philip, you're being very wayward.
I've been constantly worried, in fact, by the direction in which your emotions have been carrying you recently.
The county, for one thing, has not failed to note the length of your cousin's stay in this house.
I'm not interested in the gossip of old women, thank you.
For another, you had no right to take that necklace from the family collection.
It was not yours and won't be for another three months yet.
What of it?
It'll be mine then, won't it?
The entire estate will be yours then.
But until then, not one item of it.
Very well then, I've loaned it to her for three months.
- Is there any harm in that?
- I don't know.
I'm not sure.
What are you suggesting, that she might take it and sell it?
Quite by chance recently,
I've come to learn a little more about your cousin Rachel.
Such as what?
It happened I came across some old friends who'd been wintering in France and Italy over a period of years.
It seems they met your cousin when she was married to Sangaletti.
And?
Both were notorious for unbridled extravagance and, their own term for it, loose living.
The duel in which
Sangaletti died was fought because of another man.
These people said―
Don't you ever talk to anyone but gossips?
These people said that when they heard of Ambrose's marriage to the Countess Sangaletti, they were horrified.
They predicted she would run through his fortune in a matter of months.
I'm sorry to have to tell you all this, Philip, but my friends are responsible people and not given to idle gossip.
I've never heard anything so despicable.
- Who are these people anyway?
- Oh, it doesn't matter.
All that's important for the moment is that necklace.
You know its tradition very well.
You must explain this to her and ask her to return it to the collection.
Not in a thousand years.
- Then I must do it for you.
- I forbid you, sir.
You will not utter one word to Mrs. Ashley on the subject.
The necklace is now hers.
Philip, you're very young, very impressionable, and I quite understand your wanting to give your cousin some token of esteem, but family jewels are rather more than that, particularly that necklace.
So, as your guardian and executor of the estate,
I must be firm about it.
If you won't ask Mrs. Ashley to return it, I shall.
I'm sorry, but I couldn't help overhearing.
But I assure you there's no need for either of you to be embarrassed.
It was dear of Philip to let me wear this for the evening, but quite right of you, Mr. Kendall, to insist on its return.
Here.
- I shan't forget this, Nick.
- Philip, please.
You mustn't mind. Really.
And I was proud to have worn it for even that once.
I wanted you to wear it for always.
I know. I understand.
But that stupid, unspeakable oaf―
Now, dear, you're acting like a child.
It doesn't matter,
I assure you, not in the least.
I'm not a child, and I ask you please to remember that.
But I do, I do, darling.
I'm 5 and 20 all but three blasted months.
I object to any further patronage from anybody.
My mother wore those pearls on her wedding day.
Before that, my aunt.
Before that, my grandmother.
Don't you realize why I wanted you to wear them too?
Bless you.
Then I remembered that other evening when apparently everyone in Florence was there, and your dear, lamented mother behaved so badly with, uh, wasn't it
Prince Somanatti?
With mia madre, it might have been anyone, but not Lorenzo that night.
He was much too busy running after me, don't you remember?
That's very naughty of you.
At last.
Good evening, sir.
We've been waiting for you.
You remember Guido, of course.
I must apologize for coming without an invitation, but then neither did I expect you when you called on me.
You're welcome here, sir.
He should be scolded though.
Imagine his being in England for a week without letting me know.
I couldn't have been more surprised when he walked in.
Will you have a glass with us?
Thank you, no, I―
I think I should bathe and change first, if you'll excuse me.
Hurry then.
We'll see you at dinner.
- I'm not certain that―
- Now, Philip.
It's a pleasure to see you here, sir.
It's very good of you to say so.
He reminds me only of one person.
May I ask what that is?
It's tisane.
Guido's favorite tisane, which he says nobody can make as well as myself.
No one can make any tisane so well as your cousin.
I'm sure she knows more about herbs than any other person in the world.
Yes, but what is it, uh, tisane?
I'm sorry.
I should have introduced you to it long before now.
It's a tea made with herbs, a mixture of herbs.
In Italy, it's a very ancient art with endless variations in flavor and strength and purposes, et cetera, some of it for pleasure, some for the health.
Ambrose loved it.
And if you like it, we'll have it again.
For this young man, it must always be for pleasure, for I can imagine no one standing less in need of more health.
Have you ever had an illness in your life?
Not that I can remember.
Doesn't that worry you?
No. Why should it?
Because such people are so often the first to go when finally they are stricken.
Haven't you heard that?
I'm unalarmed by the situation.
It is probably all this violent riding and walking and swimming that young Englishmen do.
It develops the wrong portion of the body.
Now, in Italy―
Would you forgive us, Philip?
Guido and I have a good deal of rather dull business to discuss, and I believe it can be done more conveniently upstairs.
Certainly.
Will you join us later?
I'm afraid not, thank you.
I'm rather tired, really.
If you change your mind, come in at any time.
It is very kind of you to have me as a guest in your home.
I trust that you'll be comfortable.
And I must thank you, too, for all you have done for your cousin.
She wrote to me about the allowance.
You might be pleased to know that that was precisely what she had planned for you if the other will had been signed.
What other will?
She didn't tell you?
No one's told me of any other will.
Then perhaps
I shouldn't have mentioned it.
Nevertheless, there was one, with a more normal arrangement.
He left all this, this entire estate, to his widow.
But unfortunately, by the time it was drawn and copied, poor Ambrose's collapse was complete, and it was never signed.
You still have the copy, though, of course.
No, we destroyed it.
If you'll pardon me, may I ask in what sense you use the word "we"?
Is it royal or domestic?
Why, neither, sir.
It's legalistic, for lawyer and client.
Though I confess,
I expect someday to be able to use it in a sense more intimate.
When that day comes,
I shall, of course, be happy to congratulate you.
Thank you, sir.
Your graciousness helps me to understand with what regret your cousin will leave here.
If and when she does.
I understand.
Good night, sir.
Good night.
You'll have to go further than this to escape me.
How did you know
I was here?
You're always here when you're angry with me.
You'll have to go back.
It's far too cold for you here.
Not if we sit close and you put your arms around me.
You didn't come to say good night.
You didn't really expect me, did you?
I waited up for you till after 11.
With your friend?
A good hour after I'd sent him off to bed.
Is that true?
But of course.
Why do you ask that?
Where is he now?
On his way back to London.
I'm terribly sorry.
You're a goose.
You really do think me a fool, don't you?
I've told you not to say that.
It's absurd.
I've become fonder and fonder of you, in fact, each day that passes.
And each day that passes,
I'm more and more determined that I shall never let you leave here.
Date it today, if that's necessary, but make it effective tomorrow, which is my birthday.
Very well.
At midnight tonight, the property becomes mine absolutely.
There can be no objections whatever from anyone as to what I do with it.
I've never heard of such a thing before in my life.
Never.
You mean you've never before heard of a wrong being righted?
You're quite determined on this?
Quite.
Does she know about it?
Nothing whatever.
The idea is mine and mine alone.
But isn't it possible you could satisfy your love or your conscience or whatever it is with something less than the entire estate?
But suppose this were what Ambrose himself intended until he became too ill to arrange it?
We don't know that, not for a fact.
No, but I knew Ambrose, and so did you.
Would he have done anything less for the woman he loved?
No, not if he still loved her.
If you'll let me sign―
I'm sorry, Philip, but I can't help regarding this as the completest folly.
I wish now she'd never come to England.
However, if there's nothing
I can say to dissuade you, sign here, and I'll witness it.
There are some women― good women, very possibly― who through no fault of their own impel disaster.
Whatever they touch somehow turns to tragedy.
Rachel.
Wake up, Rachel.
This is not the time for sleeping, girl.
Wake up and come to the window.
Or do you want me to come in and wake you up?
What on earth, Philip?
Blessed Rachel.
What are you doing at this hour?
I wanted you to look at the moon and smell the fragrance of spring in the air.
You've been drinking.
Only at the springs of love.
Here, catch this.
I'll do no such thing.
Catch it, I tell you.
I do believe you must be raving mad.
Now pull it.
- It's heavy.
- Pull hard.
What is it?
I'll show you.
You idiot, you'll fall and hurt yourself.
Only a clod would walk upstairs on such a night.
A man in love must scale the walls.
Oh, do be careful, please.
Have you taken leave of your senses?
Perhaps, but never happier.
Please, Philip, you can't do this.
You must leave at once.
- Don't you know what today is?
- It's not day, to begin with, and if it's your birthday you mean, that's not till tomorrow.
And when, pray, do you think tomorrow begins?
- Now, Philip, you can't mean―
- Listen.
So now it's all yours.
No. Yours.
I'm cold.
Stand by the fire.
Do you remember what your mother used to tell you,
-what must happen on a birthday?
- Your hair is wet.
- I've been swimming in the sea.
- Philip, how could you in this weather?
Do you remember?
No, but it was something foolish, I'm sure.
That on a man's birthday, his every wish must be granted.
No, that's not it at all.
That's exactly what you told me not two weeks ago.
- Only up to the age of 10.
- There was no such restriction as that.
Then there is now. Up to the age of 10 and not one day older.
Very well then.
Suppose this time we reverse it.
The celebrator will try to grant you every wish.
Whatever you want.
Home, money, or perhaps these to help you while you decide.
- Are you out of your mind, Philip?
- No, and far from it.
It's only that it's my 25th birthday, and everything I have is yours.
Let me have your hand.
And this.
And, uh, this.
This.
And... this.
This is impossible, darling.
No.
This is right.
They belong on you.
And as for this... you can read it later.
What is it?
Take it.
No, Philip.
This home, this land.
Everything.
Which should always have been yours anyway.
Philip, darling.
If I owned the world, it would be yours too.
And all I had for you is a little pin for your cravat.
Blessed creature.
Remember once I told you there was nothing else
I needed in the world but the warmth and comfort of these four walls?
I remember.
I was wrong.
I know now that there's something else.
Are you very sure of that?
More sure than of anything else on earth.
For all his willfulness, for all that he provokes and bewilders me at times, my regard for you, Philip, only increases with the years.
Your errors have never been mean or selfish.
My guardianship is ended today, but I rejoice to think you will never cease to be my godson.
To your 5 and 20 years, dear boy.
Long life and happiness.
- To you, Philip.
- To Philip.
Thank you, Nick.
My dear Louise, my dearest Rachel.
Now I too have a toast that I wish you to drink tonight.
Since this morning,
I've been the happiest of men.
I want you, Godfather, and you, Louise, to drink to Rachel, who is to be my wife.
Have you lost your senses, Philip?
Uh, I'm sorry if it was premature to break the news, but... it's my birthday, and these are my oldest friends.
I hope you can forgive this piece of schoolboy folly and forget it if you can.
The day and the wine seem to have gone to Philip's head.
He'll apologize when he's himself again.
Shall we go to the drawing room?
I thought you'd gone to bed.
Not before I'd begged your forgiveness.
Then you may go now before you think of some other mischief to do.
- They won't betray us, believe me.
- Betray us?
What a shameful thing to say.
You make me feel like a backstairs servant creeping up to some attic with the groom.
- Will you let me pass, please?
- You know better than that, I'm sure.
I said, will you let me pass?
Nor were you either ashamed or angry last night
-when you gave me your promise.
- What promise?
To marry me, of course.
I promised to marry you last night?
But you couldn't possibly have misunderstood.
What else could I have been asking?
That meant everything in the world to me.
Whatever you may have thought,
I gave you no such promise or anything like it.
Then let me ask you now in the plainest of language.
Will you marry me?
No, Philip.
And you may take that as final and forever.
- Now will you let me pass?
- But you love me. I know you did.
It couldn't have been pretense.
That was last night, Philip, and you'd given me the jewels.
- Philip!
I was trying to think of what else I had to give.
You had my heart, my mind, the property, the money, the jewels.
My name you already had.
Never leave me.
You understand?
What are you going to do, lecture me?
No. I just thought you might want to talk about it.
It was my fault last night.
I don't believe that.
What you said was the truth, otherwise you wouldn't have said it.
I know that.
I misunderstood her.
You may have, but not I.
Ever.
How do you mean that?
Why do you think she came here all that long distance from Florence?
The answer to that was obvious.
It was a pilgrimage to Ambrose's home.
No, no, Philip.
It wasn't sentiment, and it wasn't idle curiosity.
She had another purpose in mind, and now it's accomplished.
You don't know what you're talking about.
If you'd been older or stronger, she'd never have stayed here.
She'd have called on my father, settled for a sum, and gone on her way.
- Can't you see that yet?
- If that's why you've asked me here, there's no need to continue this discussion.
- You've never liked her.
- Why has she sent her allowance out of the country this whole winter?
How can you say that when you couldn't possibly know it for a fact?
But I do say it, and it is a fact.
Do you suppose my father and the bank don't know what she's been doing with her money?
She had debts in Florence.
I've known that all along.
But now there's no longer any need to bleed you bit by bit, because suddenly you've given her exactly what she set out to get.
Everything.
May I see you to your carriage?
Do you really love her, then, that much?
I've already asked her to marry me twice.
When the time is right,
I intend to ask her again.
I simply cannot believe―
- She'll never marry you, Philip.
- Perhaps not.
Do you know why she brought that document to my father?
Yes. Some of it wasn't altogether clear to her.
- One point in particular.
- Which was that?
The conditions of remarriage.
There can't have been any misunderstanding about that.
It states simply that if she remarries while I'm alive, the estate reverts to me.
But if she married me, the condition would have no meaning, actually.
Why wouldn't it?
Because she'd still share in it.
It would be ours together.
You certainly can't be suggesting that she'd refuse to marry me because she'd no longer own the whole property.
No, but remember this.
A wife cannot take her husband's money into another country, such as Italy, nor can she herself wander away whenever the impulse seizes her.
Beyond that,
I suggest nothing.
Good day.
Oh, Philip, how can you be so blind?
How can you let yourself be torn and shamed and humiliated?
Because I love her, don't you understand?
I love her and nothing else.
Because it isn't a little love, and it isn't a fancy, and it isn't something you would turn on and off.
It's everything I think and feel and want and know, and there's no room in me for anything else.
Now is it clear to you?
Why three?
The mistress said there'd be a third for dinner, sir.
Come in.
Come in.
Oh, look, Philip.
Mrs. Ashley's found the most exquisite design for the sunken garden.
It's Italian, of course, but this ravine could very well be the one below this house, don't you think?
Won't you look at it?
She's so clever, really, to have found an arrangement so suitable.
It's quite nice, I'm sure.
You'll be pleased to hear that Mary's going to be with us for a while now.
Oh, and such a surprise, Philip, when she came to fetch me.
The others were quite green with envy.
Do you play cribbage?
I'm afraid not.
Well, then I'll teach you.
I'll teach you both.
You'll be wild for it.
Tonight after dinner, if you wish.
- May I speak to you alone?
- I don't see the need.
You're quite free to say anything you wish in front of Mary.
Oh, please, I'm sorry.
I must go to my room anyway.
You needn't, really.
Oh, but I must, to be ready for dinner.
Will you leave the doors open, please, so you can hear if I call?
Why, yes.
Indeed I will.
Why have you done this?
You know perfectly well why.
And you know quite as well it wasn't in the least necessary.
One such display of violence is enough, thank you.
I don't think I care to be alone with you again.
But there are matters here that can't be settled in a moment's conversation like this with the doors open.
Can't I come back here later in the evening after she's gone to bed?
No.
- How long is she to stay?
- As long as I choose.
Or until I order her out myself.
I can't really imagine your being so impertinent as to order a guest of mine out of my house.
Are you ill, sir?
I have a headache.
The ladies are in the drawing room.
Will you be coming down for dinner?
No, no. I'll see them in the morning.
You shouldn't have ridden out in weather like today.
I knew you'd be sorry for it.
Go away and leave me alone.
I'll tell the mistress that you're not well.
Rachel.
Rachel?
Mr. Philip, Mr. Philip.
My head aches.
I'll call the mistress.
- What is it, Philip?
- Rachel.
What is it, dear?
Send her away, will you?
Isn't the doctor here yet?
I won't harm you,
I promise you I won't.
Swimming at midnight, eh, and in this weather?
He shouldn't have ridden out yesterday either.
It's my head.
I've seen this fever before.
I've seen children die of it.
You must do something quickly,
Doctor.
Is that how I died?
Ambrose!
My dear Philip.
My head aches, Ambrose.
I know, dear. I know, dear.
But if you take this, it'll be better soon.
Drink it all.
Don't ever leave me, please.
I won't.
- Will you promise?
- I promise.
But you promised me you'd come back to me.
No. No, please don't.
I won't, darling, ever.
But you said you’d marry me.
No, Guido, I can't.
Not while Philip lives.
Promise it, Rachel.
I do love you so.
Not more than I love you, dear darling.
Then will you marry me now?
I will, with the happiest of hearts.
Dearly beloved.
Well... at long last.
How do you feel?
Strange. Very strange.
I shouldn't wonder.
You've been very ill for a long time.
So welcome home again.
How long?
For more than three weeks.
That's not possible.
Is this a few days' growth?
Good heavens.
Would you like a mirror?
No, thank you.
I feel like Rip Van Winkle.
You'll be all right again soon.
What was the matter with me?
On the continent, we call it meningite, but none of the doctors here seem ever to have heard of it.
Then how did they treat it?
We worked it out together.
I told them what I had seen done, and they did it, such as puncturing the spine to take out the fluid and letting into your blood a serum I made of herbs.
You don't remember that?
No.
You're an amazing woman.
In what respect now?
- You're an apothecary too.
No.
Would you like anything to eat?
No. But I'm thirsty.
Good.
I have a cool drink here, made from limes sent down from London.
I feel very sorry for you.
Why for me?
For having such a poor, weak stick of a husband on your hands.
Are you sure you don't want me to go with you, sir?
No, it's only to the sunken garden.
I want to surprise Mrs. Ashley.
She said I wouldn't be able to walk alone for another week yet.
But she's not there, sir.
She drove into Plymouth this morning.
You don't now what you're talking about.
I heard her make the appointment with the man in charge.
Come on, Don.
How are you, Tammie?
Well, sir, thankee.
And glad I am to see you out again, looking so wonderful strong too.
I'm feeling better. Trevor.
Mr. Philip.
What's the matter with the tree, dead?
No, sir. We're moving it to the old orchard.
It's getting so big, it's dropping its seed over the fence into the meadow.
I don't want the cattle to get hold of any.
Laburnum seeds.
Poison, you know.
Did you know they grow in Italy too?
- Really, sir?
- Yes, I remember now.
I saw several on Mrs. Ashley's grounds in Florence.
Must be wonderful climate.
I can understand the mistress wishing to return there.
But she doesn't anymore.
No, sir?
I'm glad to hear that.
We hear different.
That she was just waiting to see you get well again before she went.
No, this is to be her home from now on.
- Have you seen her this morning?
- Not this morning, sir.
Good morning, Corbett.
Oh, Mr. Ashley, sir.
I must say, it's good to see you out and around again, sir.
Thank you very much, indeed.
How's it coming along?
Well enough,
I suppose, sir, but it's going to be more of an undertaking than we thought.
How's that?
The underpinnings are rotten, sir.
They'll have to be replaced.
Can you brace it for the time being?
We can on Monday, sir, when we get more timber up here, but meanwhile, you should warn everyone in the house not to use it.
That's a long drop down there to those rocks, sir.
I will, though nobody ever uses it anyway.
Did you tell Mrs. Ashley?
I haven't seen her, sir.
I expected her, but she hasn't been round here this morning.
Oh. I'll tell her.
Addio, caro Guido.
Thank you.
- Good evening, Seecombe.
- Good evening, ma'am.
Philip, dear, I'm so pleased to see you down here.
Not only down here but about on the grounds too.
- Alone?
- Yes. I looked for you.
I'm terribly sorry. I went into Bodmin to do some shopping.
- I should have told you.
- Bodmin?
Yes, I needed some lace.
But I thought you said Plymouth.
I'm sorry, sir.
I had it from Wellington, who thought that it was to be Plymouth again.
I tried Plymouth last week.
I couldn't find what I wanted.
What about the headache?
None today.
Not the least sign of one.
- Oh, I'm so glad.
- First day this week without one.
Perhaps they're all gone at last.
I hope so.
I heard some gossip today that I don't quite like.
What are they saying now?
That you're going back to Florence.
Of course, but not till you're well.
You mean you're going back to sell the villa?
Oh, no, there's no need to do that now.
I can afford to keep it now.
Then why would you be going?
Can't we wait until you're better to discuss that?
You mean you want to spend the winter there?
Possibly.
Or the late summer.
There's a good deal of work piled up here since I've been ill.
I don't know that I should leave here as soon as that.
Well, I don't know that you should either, but you might like to come down in the spring for a visit.
I must still be somewhat slow-witted, but is that how you expect us to live with long separations and visits?
Please, Philip.
I've asked you not to talk about the future yet.
We still have all the time in the world for that.
But I promise you I'll not leave here until you're entirely well.
Why should you leave here at all?
This is your home now.
So is Florence.
That's where most of my friends are and my villa and a certain life that I'm more accustomed to actually than the life here.
I'm sure you must understand that I can't help but miss it.
I suppose so.
I just hadn't thought of it like that.
I find I ... am a little tired after all.
You poor dear.
Of course you are.
Come on.
We'll go up together.
This is our home really.
Our true home.
Don't you feel that?
It's a warm and comfortable room.
Someday we must set a metal plate on the wall here.
"Here Philip Ashley first set eyes on his cousin Rachel."
I think you should go now.
Come here.
Why must I , ever?
Please, Philip.
My room is all the lonelier for being so near you here.
Don't you think we could tell them now?
Tell them what?
That we're married now.
But we're not, Philip.
- Not what?
- We're not married.
But of course we're married.
On my birthday.
You can't have forgotten.
It is true, isn't it?
It would have been better if you'd let me die.
Don't say things like that.
They destroy me too.
Why didn't you tell me?
I couldn't, not while you were so ill and weak.
You'll understand, I'm sure, when you're well.
And it won't seem so important then.
Summer will be coming soon, and you'll swim and sail in the bay, and you'll be back about your work again.
And in a little while, everything will seem to you the same as it was before I came.
You really believe that?
If I didn't,
I don't think I should ever have another moment's peace of mind.
Is it Rainaldi?
No, Philip.
I know it is.
It's always been Rainaldi.
Let's not go through all that again.
And Ambrose knew it too.
You have no right to pry into such matters, but I'll answer you nevertheless, just as I answered Ambrose, who hated him too.
Guido's a friend who's seen me through every trial and trouble, who's never misjudged me or tried to see me as other than I am.
He knows all my faults and weaknesses, but has never condemned me for them, and without his help, I should have been lost time and again.
He's my only true friend, but friend only.
I'd better leave now, don't you think?
After this, could there be anything but unhappiness for both of us?
Where is he now?
Guido?
In Florence, I imagine.
When have you ever told me anything, any single word since you came into this house, but lies?
Who's that?
Thank you, Seecombe.
One of many advantages of being in service, Seecombe, is that you're not called upon to listen to a scolding from the pulpit every Sunday morning.
How do you feel this morning?
Better, thank you.
Good to see you on your feet, Philip.
There's whiskey in the library, Nick.
Thank you, my dear.
I'm leaving this evening, Philip.
There's a vessel sailing in the morning, and I've booked passage on it.
Don't you think we might be friends for these last few hours?
Of course, we must be.
There's an Italian saying that Ambrose loved.
Remember only the happy hours.
That, I think, is the way it should be with us.
It's a beautiful thought.
And in spite of everything, we've had many together, haven't we?
The very happiest.
Let me kiss you.
There are still moments when I could swear that Ambrose lives all over again in you.
Thank you.
My dear Philip.
How much better you do look.
Thank you.
So he does, by George.
The last time I saw him, he looked quite green.
- How do you feel?
- Ever so much better, thank you.
Ah, that's splendid, splendid.
Come, my dear, come, come.
My dear Louise.
Are you sure you're quite up to all this?
It's precisely what I need― all my old friends again.
Good.
Louise.
Are you staying to dinner?
Nobody is.
The vicar's got his service, and Father's going down to the farm.
Then you must make some excuse to stay here.
I want to see you alone.
It's very important.
- I'll arrange it.
- Come on, you two.
Time enough for that when I'm gone.
This is my last Sunday here, and I want it to be as happy as my first, with only Philip's and Ambrose's dearest friends around me.
Have they gone?
All but Miss Louise, sir.
Wellington can drive me home later, can't he?
Of course.
- You read Italian, don't you?
- Yes, but not very well, I'm afraid.
There's a letter in Italian that I want you to read for me if I can find it.
They're very dear people, particularly Nick, and I'm going to miss them more than I can say.
- This is for you, Louise.
- What is it?
My special tisane for Philip.
I want you to watch how I make it.
The English way, if there should be an English way, which I rather doubt, is to use peeled barley.
I brought my own dried herbs from Florence.
If you like the taste, I'll leave some of them here for you too.
In Florence I used to brew my tisane in my room and let it stand for a while.
Then Ambrose and I would go out into the courtyard and sit, the fountain playing, and it was very pleasant and peaceful sipping it slowly while the water dripped into the pool, often until after midnight.
Thank you.
I wonder if we couldn't make just such a pleasant place in the sunken garden where we might sit in the afternoons?
If I could find another little statue
- like the one in the courtyard―
- No, thank you.
Now, Philip, really.
You can't refuse this last cup with me.
It's your own brew.
You drink it for me.
No.
It's a pity to waste it, but mine's already poured and flavored to my taste.
Yes, Seecombe?
The man from the bank is here, ma'am.
Oh, yes.
Show him into the office.
Yes, ma'am.
- Will you excuse me for a moment?
- Of course.
I have this one last paper to sign.
It's a letter from Rainaldi.
I'm certain it's in her room somewhere.
I have no idea how it can be managed, but I should like desperately to get hold of that letter and read it.
Why? What's happened?
I haven't the time to explain, but I'm convinced now that Ambrose was right.
She not only murdered him, but she's done her best to kill me too.
But, Philip, you can't be serious.
Every word you uttered in the church that afternoon was the truth, and with that letter
I'm positive I can prove it.
But not murder, surely.
How else could she marry her lover and still keep possession of the estate?
Wasn't that the particular point you were intending to be sure about?
You're in a very bad humor today, and I'd like to think it's because I'm leaving.
In any case, I can't go away without trying to do something for your sulkiness.
What is it?
A mixture for your tisane, and I want your promise that you'll take it tonight before going to bed.
Will you?
- If you insist.
- I do.
It's helped you before, and it'll help you again.
Now, who'll walk with me to the sunken garden?
I've just thought of a little statue
I can get in Florence, and I want to make sure in my mind how it'd look from the other side.
If you don't mind,
Louise must leave in a few minutes, and I promised to show her an old map of the estate that someone brought to Seecombe yesterday.
Of course.
You should.
Come on.
Stand by the window and watch.
- I'll find that letter if I have to―
- I'm frightened, Philip.
Unless, of course, she's destroyed it.
Rainaldi's been here all the time, you know. In Plymouth.
She's been seeing him for weeks.
She lied about that just as she's been lying about―
Here's an odd one.
It's a receipt from the bank.
She sent them back the jewelry collection.
Then she's not taking it with her.
Very clever of her.
- Did you look all through the desk?
- Of course.
Have you looked in the blotter?
Here. It's in English.
What does it say?
"Rachel, love, my ship sails Saturday midnight.
If I don't see you again before then,
I leave defeated but with no reproaches.
I shall continue to serve you with love and friendship as long as I shall live.
As for that boy, if he is so much in your heart that you cannot bear to leave him, by all means bring him back to Florence with you, and we'll― we'll nurse him back to health.
Guido."
Oh, my God!
What is it, Philip?
What have you done?
You know the bell rope at the foot of the stairs to call the men in?
- Yes.
- Go and pull it. Ring it hard.
If something's happened,
I may need help!
I'm coming, darling. I'm coming!
Rachel, darling.
Please, please.
Rachel. Rachel!
Why did you do it?
Blessed Rachel, only you can know now this burden that I must carry to the end of my days, this question that I must ask myself again and again every day of my life, never to be answered now until we meet at last in purgatory.
Were you innocent, or were you guilty?
Rachel, my torment, my blessed, blessed torment.
-- English --
I'm sorry to bother you again.
I must be slow.
I got a quarter after.
No, Lieutenant. 4:15. Right on the nose.
You got a cigarette?
I'm all out.
Oh, here. Right there. Help yourself.
Lieutenant, you want something to read?
I got a nice Esquire, right in the bottom drawer there.
You sure?
You looking for Camp
Gee Gee, Lieutenant?
Huh?
Looking for Camp Gee Gee?
Why, is it on here?
Oh, sure.
We got all the Red prison camps marked with pins. Now, let's see.
Gee Gee.
Gee Gee.
Here we are.
Forty-one degrees.
That ought to put it somewhere around... Let's see...
Forty... Here we are.
Saman. No, no. Gee Gee.
There you are. Gee Gee.
Yeah.
Well, I guess you don't need a map to remember that dump, huh?
Guess not.
The Colonel will be along in a couple of minutes, Lieutenant.
That's what you said 20 minutes ago.
Lieutenant, this is just a routine investigation.
There's nothing to be nervous about. I'm not nervous.
I just wanna know the story on all this business.
I got a leave coming up.
Are we all gonna have to hang around here and testify at this court-martial?
Well, sir, there might not even be a court-martial.
What does that mean?
Well, you see, sir, the Colonel is the investigating officer.
Now, he just gets the facts together and makes a recommendation to the General.
Now, it's up to the General to decide whether there's gonna be a court-martial or not. Yeah, but in a case like Cargill's, there can't be any doubt, can there?
Well, I wouldn't think so.
You through with my cigarettes?
Thank you. I just wish they'd get on with it.
Lieutenant, don't worry.
Colonel Edwards will give you every break he can, believe me.
Now, you mustn't get the wrong idea about him, just because he's a staff officer.
He wasn't always in the chair-borne infantry.
You know, we were in the
Bulge together, him and me.
A college man.
She's got looks, brains, personality, everything.
Just got one blind spot, can't go for sergeants.
Colonel Edwards, it's a good thing you're back.
Yeah. I'm sorry
I kept Miller waiting.
Oh, it's not that, sir. The General called.
Twice.
Oh.
Yes?
You sent for me, sir?
Oh, yes, Bill. Come in, come in. I've been waiting for you.
I'm sorry, sir. I had to interview some people on the Cargill case.
Off the post?
Yes, sir.
That was the best way to see them. Civilians.
Well, Bill, you've been taking a lot more time than usual on this case.
You've been on it for several months.
Yes, I know.
We got a lot of cases ahead of us.
They're after me to get things moving.
I understand, sir.
Can't hold them up much longer.
Not fair to the people involved.
That's why I was hoping you'd wind this one up as soon as possible, huh?
Well, I'll do my best, sir. I've got my last witness waiting for me now.
Last one?
Yes, sir.
Good. That's what I want to hear.
All right, sir.
Boy, that's some gadget you got there, Lieutenant.
Let's see, May 15, 1954.
Oh, full moon.
How do you tell time with these things?
That must have set you back plenty.
I won it in a crap...
Baker.
Yeah? Take this over to CIC, will you?
Yes, sir.
Sit down, Lieutenant.
Sorry to keep you waiting.
I didn't realize I'd be gone so long. That's all right, sir.
This won't take too much longer, just a few routine questions.
Let's see, where were we yesterday?
Question, "Had you known
Major Cargill before
"you were prisoners together in Camp Gee Gee?"
Answer, "No, sir, none of us did."
Thank you. All right.
Now, how long were you at this camp before Cargill was put into your shack?
About four months, sir.
Uh-huh.
And that means you all lived together for nine months before it happened?
Yes, sir, that's right.
Well, tell me, Lieutenant, how did it happen?
Well, sir, it happened very suddenly. It took us all by surprise.
Yes, but just how?
Sir, you must know that.
You must have it in there.
I've got the testimony of 14 different witnesses in here, Lieutenant.
But I still need your own version of it. Yes, sir.
Now let's hear it just the way you remember it.
Yes, sir, just the way I remember it.
Well, I remember it was real cold that day. It was cold.
Man, you don't know what cold is till you've been cold in North Korea.
Like every day, they got us up at dawn.
Made us get out into the compound for one of those lectures.
Just like any other day, except for one thing.
Colonel Kim was late.
Here comes old baldy.
Yeah, the Honorable
Colonel Kim.
Wonder what he's done to Cargill this time.
What he always does.
He's got him in the hole.
Yeah, but I'll bet you first he tied old Kim up in knots again.
Don't worry about Cargill.
You want to worry about somebody, you worry about Kim.
Sit down, gentlemen.
Sit down.
Today we will review the lecture of yesterday.
The history of all previous societies has been the history of class struggles.
Struggles between the oppressors and oppressed.
Now, repeat after me.
"Communism is Peace." Ready?
Communism is...
Well, comrades.
Since you don't choose to listen to me, perhaps...
Comrade Cargill, the class is yours.
I know this will come as a surprise to you, but...
But I hope you will cooperate with me.
For our first session, we'll approach the subject from a historical point of view.
The...
As Colonel Kim has said, the history of all previous existing societies has been the history of the class struggle.
The bourgeoisie, which owns and controls the means and instruments of production, has exploited the working class which depends upon it.
But thereby the bourgeoisie has also forged the weapons of its own destruction. It...
It...
You're doing very well,
Major.
He doesn't need me here.
Continue.
Oh, yes, a word of warning.
Any harm to this comrade will bring reprisals on everyone.
Thereby the bourgeoisie has also forged the weapons of its own destruction.
It has created the men who are to wield the...
Okay, he's gone.
It has created the men who are to wield those weapons.
These are the proletarians, the standard-bearers of the new civilization...
He's gone.
...the new utopia.
It is a cause to which all men of goodwill everywhere...
...can dedicate their energies, their talents and their lives.
In Communism there is only one class and it works for peace.
Communism is peace.
Wait... Look...
Wait, listen to me.
Don't be such heroes.
This man means business now.
He's got to show results.
Miller, you understand?
Miller!
You do understand!
I don't understand.
Not even to this day, sir.
I just don't understand.
And that was the first indication that Cargill had gone over, huh?
Yes, sir, that's the first indication we had.
After that one time, did he continue these activities?
Yes, sir. Right up till the time we left Gee Gee to be exchanged.
I see.
Well, Miller, uh...
What else did he do that you'd consider collaboration?
Well, sir, we heard he made radio broadcasts for them saying the United States had used germ warfare.
Of course, we only heard about that.
I know he signed one of those germ warfare confessions,
'cause I saw one of them.
Like this?
Yes, sir, that's it.
Did he also make newsreels for the enemy?
Newsreels?
Yes.
No, sir.
No, he couldn't have.
Miller, can you think of any reason why he went over?
Well, sir,
I've been thinking.
Is it possible maybe he was a plant?
You know, he was one of them all the time?
You testified yesterday that nobody ever suspected him.
Now do you want to change your testimony?
No, sir. Now that
I think about it,
I guess he could have been, could he?
Well, I mean, I no more expected Harry to go over than I would my own brother.
Were you and Cargill close friends?
Cargill and me?
No, sir.
Well, the way you talk, I thought you might be close buddies.
No, sir, we weren't any more friends than anybody else.
Did he have any special friend in the compound?
No, sir.
Why?
Well, in the 48 hours before
Cargill broke, two men died.
Captain Connors and Lieutenant...
Harvey, sir?
Yeah, that's right. Lieutenant Harvey.
Incidentally, how did Harvey die?
Oh, I thought you knew that, sir. No.
Lieutenant Harvey died following an acute case of dysentery.
And Captain Connors?
Same thing, sir.
That dysentery must have been pretty rough, huh?
Yes, sir, it was a real killer.
In fact, sir, eight of the nine men that died in our shack died of dysentery.
You see, sir, in cases of bacillary dysentery, the incidence of death is pretty high.
Especially when there's no medicine.
You see, what happens is dehydration sets in and the sick man suffers from a general wasting away. And then he just dies.
I guess all of you got to be amateur medics, didn't you?
Yes, sir.
We had to be.
It's a pretty shocking thing to see your friends die that way.
Well, that's exactly what I meant, Lieutenant.
Seeing something like this could shock a man enough to crack him.
Especially if the victim were a close friend of his.
I see what you mean, sir, but I just told you, Cargill didn't have any close friends.
Why not?
Well, sir, I...
Was he cold? Unfriendly?
No, sir, he was friendly enough.
We used to kid him all the time. We called him Professor.
Not that he really was a professor, but he taught in some college.
He was an instructor.
Instructor, that's right.
And when we called him Professor, we weren't riding him or anything like that.
Because, you see, all the men liked him, respected him.
Right from the time he got to Gee Gee.
In fact, sir, that's one of the most vivid memories I have of the entire war.
What was that?
The first time that
Cargill got to our shack.
You see, one of the men had died during the night and we got permission to bury him.
We stood around in the rain and somebody read from a Bible.
And when we got ready to cover up the body,
Cargill steps to the edge of the grave and he says,
"My brother dies that I may live.
May I be worthy of his sacrifice."
From that time on, whenever he talked, we listened.
You see, we trusted him, we respected him, you know?
"My brother dies that I may live."
That doesn't sound like their philosophy to me, Lieutenant.
Well, that's nine months before he went over.
He had a lot of time to think.
Sir, don't you know those guys like him, these guys that think too much?
You know, they can kind of get taken in by that kind of stuff.
Then you think Cargill was "taken in"? Sir?
Well, some of these men went over for personal gain or physical comfort.
But you don't think it was that way in his case?
No, sir, there's no indication of that.
Then you think he really embraced their philosophy?
Sir, I don't know.
There's only one person who can tell you that.
As you were.
Bill, Sergeant Fleischacker told me there was a boy here from Camp Gee Gee.
Yes, sir. Lieutenant Miller, this is General Connors.
Lieutenant, you must have known my son, Captain Connors.
Joe Connors.
Oh, yes, sir.
I know I'm interrupting.
But I had to find out.
That's quite all right, sir.
Give me a minute, will you, Bill? Yes, sure.
Well.
Mint?
Thank you, sir.
Did you know my son before Gee Gee?
Oh, yes, sir. We were in the same outfit, you know.
A fine outfit, Lieutenant.
You men made quite a record for yourselves.
Thank you, sir.
But it wouldn't have been the same without Joe.
Well, in fact, sir, when Joe died, every man in the camp felt as though he'd lost a brother.
You must have known him well.
Well, sir, when you live together in a small shack that long...
Yes, sir, I knew him very well, sir.
Lieutenant, how about joining me for a drink at the club?
Well, sir... I want to talk to you about Joe.
Bill?
Yes, sir?
I asked for a minute, now I need an hour.
Is that all right with you?
Well, I was...
Yes, of course, sir.
We'll go on with this in the morning, Miller.
Come on, son.
How did Fleischacker know that Miller was in here?
Well, you know
Fleischacker, sir.
He's a one-man radar system.
Yeah.
Sir, these are finished.
Oh, thanks.
Okay, Baker, what's up?
Why, nothing, sir. Nothing at all.
Now, don't kid me.
With you it's never nothing.
Oh, that's a very unfriendly remark, sir.
Indicates a complete lack of trust and confidence.
Oh, I'm terribly sorry I hurt your feelings, Baker.
Now, what do you want?
May I take that as permission to discuss this matter further?
All I have to do is breathe and you take it as permission.
All I'm trying to do is be cooperative, sir.
I'm just trying to suggest, sir, that this case is so open-and-shut we don't even need a court-martial.
Oh, I see.
Look, sir. All we have to do is take a card, punch holes in it, one for each wrong thing this Major Cargill did, send it through an IBM machine and come up with the right answer.
That's the kind of case this is.
So?
So the sooner it's over the better.
Why?
Sir?
Why? You've got to have a reason.
Well, if the Colonel will forgive me for saying so, you're wrong.
Look, sir, I'm no intellectual.
I don't need a reason.
But as long as the Colonel has opened up the subject for further discussion,
I would like to say that
I don't like the whole idea of the Colonel handling this case. This is a hot potato, sir.
Baker, is there anything else on your mind?
Yes, sir, as long...
Just answer yes or no.
Anything else on your mind?
Yes, sir.
Then shut up.
Yes, sir.
Well, wait.
Wait a minute.
If you really want to do something for me, go out to the machine and get us some coffee.
Coffee, Evans?
Yes, sir.
Never mind, it's on me.
Yeah, the Colonel's throwing a farewell party.
What's the matter with him today?
Maybe it isn't Baker.
What?
Well, sir, perhaps you're a bit touchy today.
After all, it is possible.
Oh, is it?
Well, sir, if you'd really like my opinion, yes.
Evans, I'm tired of being analyzed today.
I'm tired of being told...
I'm tired of being told how to do my job.
And if I'm touchy and why.
Sir, what are extenuating circumstances?
Oh, I don't mean that.
I mean, couldn't something be extenuating circumstances to one person and not to another, sir?
That's always a matter of opinion, Baker.
Well, let's say that there's a general who had a son who died in a prison camp.
That's just for the sake of argument.
Let's say there's a major who's at this same camp who went over to the enemy to save his own neck and comes out of the whole deal alive.
Baker, there is a prescribed routine in all cases involving possible court-martial, right?
And if it takes a certain amount of time, we'll take that time, right?
Right.
But when it's done, it'll have been done with full regard for his rights under the Uniform Code of
Military Justice. You understand?
Mmm-hmm.
That's very good, sir, as far as the book is concerned.
Where the General is concerned...
The General happens to be a friend of mine.
Oh, but, sir, I happen to be a friend of Sergeant Fleischacker, who works in the
General's office.
It is Sergeant Fleischacker's opinion that...
Baker, knock it off, will you?
Okay. No more advice for you, though.
Good.
Sir...
Major Cargill is at the reception desk.
Okay, have him come up.
You can go up now, Major.
This way, Major.
Major Cargill, sir.
Come in, Major.
Sit down.
Word certainly gets around, doesn't it?
Well, I'm sure you're aware of the seriousness of the charges against you, aren't you, Major?
Now, first, let me review your rights under the Uniform Code of Military Justice.
You don't have to answer...
I don't have to answer any incriminating questions.
I don't have to make any statements. I have the right to be represented by counsel.
Article 31 of the Code.
I'm familiar with it.
I'm willing to answer all questions and I don't want to be around when you question witnesses.
Okay.
Let's get on with it.
Name. Rank. Serial number.
Harry Cargill, Major.
Artillery. 09432305.
You're the same
Major Harry Cargill who was imprisoned at
Camp Gee Gee in Korea?
Yes, sir.
You were captured during the breakthrough along the Yalu River in North Korea?
Yes, sir.
You were hospitalized for two months and you were transferred to this Camp Gee Gee?
That's right.
Well, Major, certain charges have been made against you.
I'll recite them, then you'll have the opportunity of making a statement.
Now, first, it's alleged...
May I smoke?
First, it's alleged that during November, 1951, you made a radio broadcast for the enemy in which you admitted taking part in germ warfare.
Well?
Huh? Oh, I'm sorry.
Would you repeat that, please?
It's alleged that during November, 1951, you made a radio broadcast for the enemy in which you falsely admitted taking part in germ warfare. Is that true?
Yes.
It is further charged that you gave indoctrination lectures favorable to the enemy to your fellow prisoners.
Is that true?
Yes, sir.
I have a statement here confessing to germ warfare which supposedly carries your signature.
It's my signature.
Well, look at it first,
Major.
Mmm-hmm. Yeah, that's my signature.
Did you ever make propaganda newsreels for the enemy?
Yes. Yes, I did.
Look, Major. I've already advised you of your rights to counsel, so I suggest you get a lawyer before we proceed any further.
I don't want a lawyer. I just want to get this over with as quickly as possible.
Don't you realize you're being accused of treason?
Yes, I realize that.
And you still want to confess without consulting a lawyer?
Why not? I'm guilty.
Of everything?
Yes, of everything. Including making newsreels for the enemy?
Major, why are you trying to hang yourself?
Why do you confess to something that you didn't do?
Because, as I told you before, I want to get this over with as quickly as possible.
Now, will that be all?
No, not quite.
The Army not only wants to know if you did these things, but also why. So sit down.
Well, Major?
Well what? Why'd you make those broadcasts, give those lectures?
Because I had no choice.
That mean you were tortured?
Yes.
How?
Just tortured.
Well, they must have done certain things to you. What?
Well, they put me in the hole.
What was it like?
Just a hole scooped out of the ground, covered over with boards, like solitary confinement.
How many times did they put you in the hole?
I don't know. Nine, ten times, maybe. I don't remember exactly.
That's what made you break?
Yes.
The day you broke, they put you in the hole that day? Yes.
And the day before?
Yes.
And the day before that?
Yes.
That's a lie, Major, and you know it.
I've got the testimony of 14 witnesses here who deny you were in the hole on any one of those days.
Now, what are you trying to do?
What do all these details matter? I told you I'm guilty.
That's the important thing, isn't it?
Do you want to make any statement at all in your own defense?
I do not.
Well, in that case, there's no point in prolonging this, is there?
None whatsoever.
Oh, just one more thing,
Major.
Today on our English-language news broadcast
we have an interview with an officer of the United States Army.
The truth he speaks will be of interest to all Asiatic peoples.
I will now ask questions.
Who are you?
I'm Major Harry Cargill.
What's the point of this?
I want you to identify these voices for me.
...those who listen will know that this is the truth,
tell us your serial number.
My serial number is 09432305.
That's my voice. Okay?
Who's the interrogator?
Now, Major, before you were captured...
Colonel Kim, Commandant of Camp Gee Gee.
Now, if that's all...
No, that's not all.
I thought you'd like to listen to the entire transcript, Major.
So you were with a bombing squadron.
What was purpose of squadron?
To drop bombs.
Look, uh, couldn't we do this some other time? We've got to do it now.
What kind of bombs?
Bacteriological.
You mean germs?
Deadly germs?
Yes, germs.
Deadly germs.
American airplanes have dropped deadly germs on innocent, helpless Asiatic...
Turn it off.
...peoples of Korea.
United States has engaged...
Turn it off.
...in germ warfare against the people of Asia.
That is so?
Please turn it off.
Was it so, Major?
The United States has...
Turn it off!
You swear on your honor that American bombers...
That will be all,
Major.
But you'll be called back tomorrow.
Your testimony is interesting, but incomplete.
You'll find that simply saying you're guilty is not enough.
You don't understand.
I am guilty.
Hey, there's no pay for overtime in the Army.
Well, I thought you'd want Cargill's testimony as soon as possible, sir.
Yeah, I do. Come on.
Let's get out of here.
Baker been putting the pressure on you, too?
What do you mean? About what a special case this is.
Oh, no, sir.
No lectures about what Baker thinks
Fleischacker thinks the General thinks?
No, sir. Why?
Nothing.
But just understand one thing, Evans.
This is no different than any other case in this office.
Yes, sir.
What's the matter?
I'm sorry, but
I can't go with you.
I've got to go back.
That overtime?
Yeah. Good night, Evans.
Did you see this?
What's the matter, you've been here all night, or what?
What's the matter?
What happened?
What's the matter?
Nothing's the matter.
Take a look at that.
What about it?
What about it? That is an order from the General.
Well, one thing's for certain, it's not an order from any sergeant, Sergeant.
Oh, come on now, no jokes. Look at that signature, will you?
"Signed, Joseph Connors,
Lieutenant General Commanding."
Now, just any order would be signed by his adjutant.
But when the General signs the order himself, that is significant, that is really significant.
"In view of the backlog of work
"which has been observed in some divisions of this headquarters,
"it is directed that all accumulated work
"be completed with efficiency and dispatch."
"With efficiency and dispatch."
Now, I'm telling you, the Colonel is in trouble.
You think this is really directed at the Colonel?
The only way the old man could make it any plainer would be to put up a neon sign saying,
"Don't waste time on the Cargill case."
Sergeant, I think you're jumping to conclusions.
Am I?
Hey, wait a minute, you can't do that.
I know.
That's an official document. I'll bring it back.
I'm just gonna check it with Fleischacker...
Check what with Fleischacker?
Good morning, sir.
Good morning.
Just wanted to make sure it didn't get mislaid, sir, that's all.
I'll bet.
Maybe now you'll believe me when
I tell you that the General...
Baker, uh, will you get me some coffee?
Sir, what about the memo?
Just coffee, Baker.
One or two donuts?
Just coffee, Baker!
Coffee. Just coffee,
Baker. Coffee, Baker.
Baker says the General really meant that memo for you.
Baker says?
Baker and Confucius seem to enjoy the same standing around here.
We will proceed on the assumption that this memo is exactly what it appears to be, a general order to spruce up the entire post.
Yes, sir. We will proceed on the assumption.
Well, if the General had wanted to say something,
I'm sure he'd have come right out and said it.
Yes, sir.
Excuse me.
It's all right, sir. I know you must be tired.
I'm sorry, Evans.
They didn't have any donuts.
Are you finished with these, sir? Thanks. Yeah.
Baker, will you take these to the library? Yeah.
"Techniques Used by North Koreans to
Indoctrinate United States Personnel."
Well...
"Psychology of Brainwashing
Methods." All right, Baker.
I didn't say anything.
Just take them back, then go down to car pool and get a car.
Are we going somewhere?
Yep, we're going somewhere.
Mrs. Cargill?
Yes?
I'm Colonel Edwards,
Investigating Officer...
My husband's on his way to your office.
Yes, I know.
That's why I'm here.
I'd like to talk to you.
May I come in?
Well, you're much younger than I expected.
I'm 32.
You don't look it.
I look it.
Mrs. Cargill, I...
I know how painful all this must be for you, but unfortunately, it's necessary.
I'm here because I'm trying very hard to be fair to your husband, to give him every chance, but I can't do it alone. I need help.
How do you expect me to help?
Believe me,
I'm not your enemy.
Or your husband's.
But you must know he's facing serious charges and he refuses to defend himself.
He refuses to defend himself?
Didn't you know?
No.
You really didn't know, did you?
No.
Well, can you think of any reason why he won't defend himself?
Have you come here to ask me to appear as a witness?
Yes, I have. Because I think there's more to this case than we can see.
Now, if you're afraid you might betray him or might hurt his chances in any way, just let me say that things couldn't be any worse for him than they are right now.
What're you going to do to him?
On the strength of what we've learned,
I'm afraid he'll get the limit.
So, you see,
Mrs. Cargill, you can only help him by telling everything you know.
I don't know anything.
Well, what has he said about his life in the prison camp?
He hasn't said a thing.
In all the months he's been back, he's said nothing?
Maybe there are some things a man doesn't want to talk about.
Or can't talk about.
Even to his own wife?
Especially to his own wife.
Well, didn't you ask?
Weren't you curious?
He was gone two years, eight months and seventeen days.
Yes, I was curious.
Oh, I thought it would come in time.
That if he wanted to tell me, he would.
But he never has.
What does he talk about?
Oh, what do people talk about when they don't want to talk?
Little things, meaningless things. Nothing worth remembering.
Well, since he's been back, hasn't he...
Hasn't he revealed something accidentally?
No.
You know, a slip of some kind?
A story he started to tell and didn't finish, anything like that?
No.
He's told you absolutely nothing?
Well, I remember something that he said on his first day back.
He said, "Why is it that most people can only belong to
"a family, a country, a religion?
"Why can't they all belong to just one thing, the human race?"
Mrs. Cargill, a man who felt that way might be ripe for a cause, and if it were the wrong cause, I'm afraid...
So you really think he went over to them?
No, no, no.
I didn't say that.
But you think it's possible? Isn't it?
Is that what they've done?
Have they twisted our thinking so that a man has to be afraid of a decent instinct?
So that he has to be ashamed to show some concern for his fellow man?
I'm sorry, Mrs. Cargill, but it's an old trick to hide an ugly reality behind a beautiful phrase.
He's been through so much.
Why don't you let him go?
The fact that he's been through so much is no defense.
For his own sake, we've got to make him talk.
But can't you understand how he feels?
He's a very sensitive man and he's been deeply hurt.
Nobody wants him.
His own men have turned against him.
He's nobody.
He has no place to stand.
Oh, Colonel, please give him a place.
Give him a place!
I can't do a thing, Mrs.
Cargill, until I know his story.
He's got to talk.
And you want me to make him talk. Is that all?
Yes.
Colonel...
Colonel, he's been home five months. Five months.
And in all that time, we haven't even been to bed together.
And you want me to make him talk.
Mrs. Cargill, please.
Please, please, Mrs. Cargill.
Colonel, somebody's got to help him.
There must be a way.
There must!
I'm trying, Mrs. Cargill.
Believe me, I'm trying.
I'm sorry.
No, no, no, that's quite all right.
Before I go, I've got to ask you just one more question.
Yes.
Was there any particular thing of which your husband was afraid?
Afraid? Yes, did he have any experiences during the war or even before that might have given him a strong fear, an anxiety of some kind?
A fear?
Mmm-hmm.
No, I don't think so.
No, the only time I remember him even mentioning the word was once in a letter and I don't suppose that's what you mean.
No, no, no, go on.
You tell me.
Well, he just said, "I have finally become afraid."
Yes?
I remember it because he'd never written anything like that before.
Why was he afraid? Did he say why?
No, I don't think so.
It's been such a long time.
Nine years.
Please. Whatever you can remember might be of some help.
I...
I remember how he ended the letter.
It was a quotation of some sort.
Mmm-hmm.
He said, "Who kills one man kills the whole world."
And then he added, "How many worlds have I killed?"
"Who kills one man kills the whole world.
"How many worlds have I killed?"
Does that help you in some way?
I don't know,
Mrs. Cargill.
I'm not sure, but it might.
Well, thank you very much for talking to me.
I'm sorry I had to bother you.
Thank you.
Goodbye.
Colonel.
Yes?
Colonel, if you do find out anything,
I mean, if he tells you anything, you will let me know, won't you?
Yes, of course I will.
Thank you.
I'll be waiting.
Goodbye, Mrs. Cargill.
Bye.
I'll call for you when
I'm ready.
Major Cargill's waiting, sir. I know.
Evans, he's two different men. Sir?
The man we saw here yesterday and the man his wife described.
Two different men.
His wife?
Yeah, I was just talking to her.
And I'm glad I did, too, because that man out there and her Cargill...
Well, her Cargill just doesn't commit treason.
Well, maybe her Cargill changed, sir.
Of course he changed.
But how? Why?
Well, perhaps it was a causative factor that...
"Causative factor"? Evans, where'd you ever dig up a dusty phrase like that?
Well, my father was a lawyer.
Really?
It's not so unusual, sir.
There are about 200,000 lawyers in this country.
So it shouldn't surprise you so.
Everything about you surprises me, Evans.
Sir, we were talking about a causative factor.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, we were.
What I was going to say is that something happened to change Cargill.
Something big and obviously rather sudden because...
Hey, wait a minute.
Yes, sir?
Miller's testimony yesterday. Yes, sir.
There was something in there when he was describing how Cargill went over.
Didn't he say something like, "Somebody...
"Somebody means business now."
Wasn't that it?
Well, if he said it, I can find it.
Good.
You got it?
Here it is, sir.
I can't read this.
I'm sorry.
"Don't be such heroes, this man means business now."
That's it. That's it. That's it.
"This man means business now."
And this man has got to be Colonel Kim.
Colonel Kim means business now.
And it happened suddenly. They all said suddenly, didn't they?
I think so, sir.
I'll check.
And the important word is now.
Not a month ago or a week ago, but now.
That's the word.
You got it?
"The thing happened very suddenly, it took us all by surprise."
"It happened suddenly.
It took us all by surprise."
Suddenly, suddenly, suddenly, suddenly...
Sir.
What?
I don't want to interfere with your train of thought...
No, don't worry about that, go ahead. What've you got?
Well, sir, speaking of repetitive wordage...
What do you mean, repetitive wordage?
Well, sir, it's true they all said it happened very suddenly.
But there's something else, too. What?
Well, when you were talking about...
When the men were describing the...
The deaths of
Harvey and Connors, they all used very similar phrases in describing the disease and its consequences like bacillary dysentery and dehydration...
Well, that's only natural.
They didn't have any doctors, they had to be familiar with all kinds of...
Repetitive wordage.
Did you make a note of those places, Evans? Yes, sir, I did.
Captain Mike Stewart's testimony, sir.
All right.
"Question. How did
Lieutenant Harvey die?
"Answer. He died following an acute case of dysentery."
Mmm-hmm.
"Bacillary dysentery, dehydration."
You got another one, Evans?
Lieutenant Poleska's.
"Died following an acute case of dysentery.
"Bacillary dysentery."
What's this one? And here, sir, Lieutenant Harper's.
"Died following an acute case of dysentery."
An acute case.
Never a bad case or a violent case, it's always an acute case. Yes, sir, I know.
I think you're right, Evans. There are too many witnesses using exactly the same words.
I thought it was significant, sir.
You see, when you type the same phrase over and over, it begins to make an impression.
Corporal, any time you want to interfere with my train of thought,
I mean, if you notice anything that strikes you as being peculiar...
So your father was a lawyer, huh?
Yes, sir.
I hope I'm not interrupting anything,
Bill, but I want to talk to you.
Yes, of course, sir.
Didn't you tell me that Lieutenant
Miller was your last witness on the Cargill case?
That's right, sir.
Then why did you go to see Cargill's wife?
There's not much around this post that escapes Sergeant Fleischacker, you should know that.
Well, Cargill refuses to defend himself. I...
I thought his wife might be helpful.
So now you're concerned with his defense?
Well, sir, if I'm to do my job fairly I...
Are you suggesting that I'm asking you not to do your job fairly?
No, sir. Bill, we've worked together for years.
You know me as well as anyone does. I...
I try to be fair-minded.
You are.
I've let you take your time even when I thought you were taking more time than was necessary.
But Mrs. Cargill is hardly a competent witness to something that happened in a Korean prison camp
9,000 miles away.
Bill, I don't want to do this, but now I feel compelled to ask you officially for the first time, what's going on in this case?
I just can't make any recommendation, sir, until I have all the facts.
Then get 'em. Fast.
Finish your investigation and let's have the court-martial.
General, we can't investigate fairly if we start out by saying there's going to be a court-martial.
That's prejudging the evidence.
You mean there's even a possibility you'll not recommend a court-martial?
Well, all I'm saying, sir, is that it's too early to tell.
When there is clear evidence of collaboration?
Photostats of his signature on confessions, recordings of his own voice making broadcasts for them?
There are unexplained things, too, sir.
Insufficient motive, for one.
Insufficient motive?
Yes, sir.
Maybe the motive was so obvious it hasn't occurred to you.
Maybe it was planned this way.
Sir? I think Cargill may have been one of them before he ever got to Camp Gee Gee.
Well, there's nothing in the records to indicate that, sir.
And I see nothing to indicate otherwise.
They could make a big thing out of an American officer, a major, a mature, responsible man going over to them.
Bill, this would be a lot easier on both of us, certainly on me, if this case had been assigned to another post.
But the Pentagon assigned it here and here it is.
We can't change that.
I know.
I understand that, sir.
All right, then let's get it finished up with efficiency and dispatch.
After all, Bill, there's a human side to this, too.
Those men, after the hell they went through in that prison camp, now we keep it hanging over them.
The knowledge that they'll have to relive it all by testifying.
That's quite an ordeal.
Believe me, if you could have seen that Lieutenant Miller yesterday at the Officer's
Club, you'd know what I mean.
Why, he almost broke down and...
He almost broke down and cried when he talked about my boy.
Told me that one of the men at the camp had died.
At the funeral, when they...
When they were covering up the body,
Joe stood there at the grave site and said,
"My brother dies that I may live.
"May I be worthy of his sacrifice."
Yes, that's a...
That's a very fine sentiment, sir.
Well, I...
I don't mean to talk about my son.
The only point
I was making is we can't keep these innocent men sweating it out.
It isn't fair to them.
So let's get this over with fast and let them pick up their lives again. That's all I'm asking.
I'll try, sir.
Good.
I knew you would.
But I still have to be thorough.
Thorough? I think you better get Cargill's file and come to my office immediately.
He said immediately, sir.
I know.
The Cargill file, sir.
Yeah.
Hey, sir... Get Cargill in here before Miller shows up.
I don't want those two meeting yet.
Sir, what about the General...
Look, Baker, just this once, let me handle it, will you?
Okay, sir.
What's going on here, huh?
The General's fanning his tail, huh?
Hello, reception, Scotty?
Scotty, you got a Major
Cargill down there?
Yeah. Send him up, will you? Right.
What's happening?
Okay. All right, don't tell me.
You know, I don't have to be a genius to figure this one out.
He's bucking a General.
He's sticking his neck out for a traitor who won't even defend himself.
Won't even tell him the truth, right?
Right.
I tell you, I've been in this man's army a long time and when...
Well, excuse me, sir.
Sir, the Colonel asked if you wouldn't like to wait in his office, sir.
Baker...
Hey, you stay out of this.
Major, sit down, sir.
Make yourself comfortable.
Like a cigarette, sir?
Baker, would you file these for me, please?
Oh, come on.
Outside, later, huh?
All right, all right, have it your way.
Sir, we have what is commonly known as a situation around here.
As a matter of fact, the Colonel is down in the General's office right this minute.
And he's in the act of what's described in military language as getting...
He's being chewed out, as they say, sir, severely chewed out.
Now, this doesn't seem to bother you at all, does it?
Baker, please.
Now, half the army knows the General is blowing his top, why shouldn't he?
I beg your pardon, sir.
Sure you don't want a cigarette? No, thank you.
King size? Filter top?
No, no. No, thank you.
Oh, you can't catch anything from these things, Major.
It's got 100% purified cellulose, it's got activated charcoal, radioactive M3.
I mean, you positively couldn't catch a thing from these.
After all, sir, I wouldn't want to see you get cancer of the lungs.
That's very kind of you to be so solicitous.
Oh, sir, this is the...
This is the most solicitous branch in the Army.
You know what we do around here, sir? We worry, don't we?
Even about traitors.
Take the Colonel, for example. He worries about you.
He's knocking himself out on your case and I mean out.
So, you know what
I was thinking, sir?
Well, you're obviously a very deep thinker, Sergeant.
I wouldn't even try to guess.
I was thinking, sir, that you could show your appreciation for what the Colonel's doing for you by talking, you know, just start to tell him the truth.
Of course, if you don't feel like doing that, sir,
I've got another suggestion for you.
What would you suggest?
Well, I'm very glad you asked me because I'll tell you.
I'll tell you why I wouldn't want you to get cancer of the lungs, sir.
It just takes too long.
Baker.
Leave him alone, Corporal.
Thank you, sir. Now, if you'd like my suggestion, get a heart attack, get run over, get lost, get something.
That's what you can do, sir.
Baker, that's insubordination.
Oh, is it?
You know what happens to colonels who buck generals?
You let the General give him one bad efficiency rating and he's stuck at colonel for the rest of his time.
Well, if that's the worst thing that can happen...
Oh, but it isn't. Comes a time when he's forced to retire.
So? Well, now, that might be all right with you, but it wouldn't be all right with him.
I'm going to explain something to you, Miss Phi Beta Kappa.
When one is retired by the Army,
one does not put an ad in
The New York Times saying,
"US Army man with top experience wants a job in another army."
There's only one army in this country.
It's a monopoly.
It might be illegal but it's true.
So for an ex-Army man, there's no other place to go.
Now, the Army needs guys like the Colonel, because he's fair, he listens and he'll give a guy a break.
So for the Army's sake, I wouldn't want to see him get fouled up and especially not because of anybody like you.
You got it, sir?
You know, he's right about one thing.
If you talked, you'd make it easier for the Colonel.
Look, all he's asking you to do is tell the truth, so he can make a fair recommendation.
Truth?
It can only help you.
Why does everybody put such store in the truth?
Why is truth considered to be so bright and shining and wonderful?
Truth can be rotten and destructive and more vicious than any lie.
Because a lie might die one day, but the truth never dies.
So don't urge the truth on me. I've seen it.
The filth, the torture, the misery, what one man can do to another.
There's your truth.
But if it could save you or if it could help you in some way...
You can take a piece of granite and put it under pressure until the heat that's created will turn that stone to liquid.
Did you know that?
Granite!
They call that a scientific phenomenon.
Well, there's another phenomenon.
It has to do with something much less durable than granite.
It has to do with the mind of man.
Now, you put that under enough pressure and it turns to water.
When that happens, they don't call that a scientific phenomenon.
They just say he's a coward, no good, rotten.
They never understand.
Well, the Colonel wants to understand.
He wants to know what kind of pressure was put on you.
Look, you can talk to him.
Why don't you defend yourself?
Why don't you care anymore?
It isn't any one thing that makes a man not care anymore.
It isn't that simple. So nobody's asking for any simple answers.
There aren't any answers!
Just let it go at that.
Sit down, Cargill.
If I remember correctly, you smoke, don't you, Major?
No, thank you.
I want to apologize for yesterday.
I mean about running that tape recording so long.
I didn't realize you were so sensitive about it.
I only hope you've recovered sufficiently so that today you can answer some questions.
I don't know any more today than I did yesterday.
Then perhaps today you'll tell me a little more of what you do know.
Look, I told you yesterday, I'm guilty.
Now I don't see any point in going over the same ground again.
Oh, we're not going over the same ground, Major.
I'd like to touch on some things that we didn't even mention yesterday.
Like a certain sequence of events which becomes very striking.
Sequence of events? A definite pattern of life in that prison camp.
Brainwashing, starvation, sickness, death.
For nine months.
Yet no man broke.
And there was a period of three months when nobody died.
And then suddenly, very suddenly, as a matter of fact, in a 48-hour period,
Lieutenant Harvey died,
Captain Connors died, and you broke.
That's right.
Was there any connection between the deaths of Harvey and Connors and your breaking?
None.
Your breaking followed their deaths so closely,
I think there must be a connection.
I'm telling you there wasn't.
All right.
I accept it.
Incidentally, how did Harvey die?
I don't remember.
You don't remember?
A man can't remember everything.
No, of course not.
Major, at whose burial did you say,
"My brother dies that I may live.
"May I be worthy of his sacrifice"?
They told you that, did they?
There can't be any harm in admitting you said it, can there?
I said it. Why?
If you were to give some reason as to why you broke, what would that reason be?
I suppose that some men are weaker than others.
You mean then, that you were the weakest man in your shack?
Evidently.
You signed confessions, you made broadcasts, you gave lectures, all because you were weak?
A man wants to stay alive.
And in your desire to stay alive, you didn't think of the effect of what you did?
Effect? It didn't trouble you that probably 200 million Asiatics were hanging in the balance?
That your words were weapons against everything you ever believed in.
That didn't matter?
No. It didn't matter.
It didn't matter that you might be endangering the lives of millions of your own countrymen, because that's what it'll cost if Asia falls to the enemy.
That didn't matter?
I told you before.
How many times do I have to tell you? It didn't matter.
Well, tell me again, Major Harry
Cargill, specialist on germ warfare.
Shut up!
What's the matter, Major?
Don't you like the sound of it?
Do you know what I think?
I think you were frightened by that recording yesterday, because it haunts you.
I think you're haunted by the ghosts of dead minds as well as dead bodies.
Minds that you helped to kill by your broadcast.
Minds that were pushed over the brink by you.
Isn't that right, Major?
I told you to shut up!
Answer me. Isn't that right?
I don't have to answer.
Answer me!
What kind of an inquisition is this?
You'd like it to be an inquisition, wouldn't you?
But it's not going to be.
You're going to be defended, whether you like it or not, because we've got a standard of justice we'll follow in spite of you.
Standard of justice?
You poor fool. That's ancient history, Colonel.
You're out of style, you and your standards.
You're obsolete.
It's a new kind of world.
Kill, destroy, dog eat dog.
And maybe that's the way it ought to be, because I don't think mankind deserves any better.
You really believe that?
Yes, I believe that!
"Who kills one man kills the whole world.
"How many worlds have I killed"?
Where did you hear that?
Your wife.
My wife?
You leave her out of this...
I'll get my information any way I can, Cargill.
Now get in here.
You had no right. I don't care what you do to me, but you've got no...
Now, that's an order!
Miller here yet?
Yes, sir.
All right, get him in here.
Sir, here are the carbons from Miller's testimony.
Okay, thanks.
Get Baker, too.
Yes, sir.
Come in, Lieutenant.
Sit down.
There isn't much we have to cover today.
I was just going over your testimony last night.
I'd like to clear up a few minor points.
Well, I'll do anything
I can to help, sir.
That's fine.
I knew you would.
Now first, when Cargill said,
"This man means business now," what was he referring to?
Cargill said that? That's what you told me yesterday.
No, sir. I don't think
I said that. Oh, yes.
Yes, you did, Lieutenant.
You said...
You said,
"Cargill said,
"'Don't be such heroes.
This man means business now.'"
Well, if it's in there, I guess I must have said it.
I'm sorry, sir.
I forgot, I guess.
What did he mean by that?
Well, that's pretty obvious, isn't it? Is it?
Well, yes.
The way I figure, Colonel Kim must have been getting impatient.
You know, all that time had gone by, nobody cracked or anything, so he's getting ready for his showdown. And was he?
I don't know, sir. It was
Cargill that said it, not me.
Yes.
Speaking of things
Cargill said.
"My brother dies that I may live.
May I be worthy of his sacrifice."
Did Cargill say that?
Yes, sir.
Or did Captain Connors say that?
No, sir.
Cargill said it.
But you told the General his son said it.
Sir, with all...
With all due respect to the General, he must've misunderstood me, because it was Cargill that said it.
I see.
Now another thing, Miller.
In the 48 hours before
Cargill broke, two men died.
Lieutenant Harvey and Captain Connors.
That's right, sir. I told you about that yesterday, sir.
Yes, I know you did. Now I wonder if you'd mind telling me how Harvey died.
I told you that, too.
Yesterday.
You can tell me again, can't you?
Yes, sir.
Go ahead.
Lieutenant Harvey died following an acute case of dysentery.
And Connors?
Same thing.
An acute case of dysentery?
Yes, sir.
You're sure of this?
Yes, sir, I'm sure.
I was there.
Come in.
By the door, Baker.
All right, Major, come in.
Stand over there.
Now, Miller,
I'd like you to tell me how Lieutenant Harvey and Captain Connors died.
I told you.
I want to hear it again.
Not everyone seems to have the same memory of it.
They died of dysentery.
You see, sir, in cases of bacillary dysentery, the incidence of death is pretty high.
Especially when there's no medicine.
You see, what happens is...
Dehydration sets in.
Dehydration sets in.
And a sick man suffers.
He suffers from a general wasting away.
Go ahead, Lieutenant.
Well...
You see, sir, there wasn't much anything we could do.
He's...
We didn't have any choice.
Well...
We had to...
We had to pool our rice...
And we had to pool our water and we...
We tried to keep the sick ones alive. We...
You told him, didn't you?
Didn't you?
You told him, didn't you?
I didn't tell him anything.
Yes, he did tell me. He told me he doesn't remember
Harvey and Connors dying of dysentery.
He doesn't remember that at all.
So, come on, Miller, the truth! Come on, let's have it!
Talk.
Don't!
Come on, the truth.
No lies.
No memorized speeches, just the truth. Spill it.
Don't say anything!
I told him nothing.
It wasn't only me.
You gotta believe that.
All right, it wasn't only you. Now, come on, everything.
The rest of it.
Everything.
We were all in it together. All of us. I swear that's the truth!
We all voted for it!
We had to do it.
Everybody agreed to do it. Everybody except him!
You can't do it!
Now, this is it.
You can't draw lots for a man's life.
Why not? He's guilty.
Now you had your say, and you got outvoted.
Now shut up.
Whoever gets this one, he's the man.
Now, we're all in this together.
Nobody talks. Ever.
That includes you,
Cargill.
Understand?
You better understand.
Come on.
Come on.
Hurry up.
Hurry up, he's coming.
Take one.
Come on.
Miller.
Remember, we're all in this together.
Okay.
Who's got it?
Come on.
Harper.
Not me.
Miller.
Hurry up!
You know what to do.
Miller, no.
You can't do this.
Don't do it...
Hi.
Hi, fellas.
Tough couple of days.
Really put me through the wringer.
Connors, get out...
Hey, what's wrong?
Miss anybody?
No, nobody.
Well, take another look.
Take a good look.
Yeah, while you're looking around,
Connors, take a look in that corner.
Where's Harvey?
Where do you think he is,
Connors? He's dead.
Last night I told him not to try to escape.
It was suicide.
It was just one chance in a thousand.
You're wrong, Connors.
He didn't have any chance.
What do you mean?
You know what we mean.
Shut up!
You hear me? Shut up!
Will you?
How did they know that Harvey planned to make a break for it?
I don't know.
I never mentioned his name.
What did you mention?
Nothing.
Then how did they know?
I don't know.
Well, someone tipped them off.
And you're the only guy who's been out of this shack since yesterday morning.
The only one, Connors.
That doesn't prove a thing.
Ten guys tried breaking out of here, not one of them made it.
Harvey didn't have a chance.
You guys know that.
There's something you ought to know.
Harvey never tried to escape.
What?
Harvey wasn't going to make a break for it. We talked him out of it.
He'd be alive now except for you.
No, no, no...
Shh!
You told them, Connors, because when they came here, they knew exactly what to look for.
They were looking for a guy with a knife on him.
They found the knife on Harvey and they shot him in the back because you tipped them off.
No, listen. Kim promised he wouldn't do it.
He promised he wouldn't kill him. He told...
Honest!
No, no!
Okay, hold him.
No, Miller!
Hold him.
No, no, no!
No, Miller!
No, no.
No, Miller. Miller, no.
No! No!
I didn't want to. I didn't want to. I didn't.
I had to do it.
I had to.
I swear that's the truth.
I'm sorry I had to do this to you.
I don't care.
I'm glad I told.
It's no rotten secret anymore.
Will they try me for murder?
No,
I don't think so.
You sure?
Evans, the notes.
Miller, I want you to see this.
There'll be no record in the file.
We'll just forget it. The evidence is inadmissible.
Baker.
Come on, Lieutenant.
Lieutenant, come on, sir.
George, I'm sorry.
Don't you touch me.
Lieutenant, Lieutenant.
Come on, sir. Come on, sir.
Let me go.
All right, Cargill, that's part of the story. Now, what's the rest of it?
It wouldn't help.
It might help you.
You just take my word for it. It wouldn't.
What happened after
Connors was killed?
There were no more stool pigeons.
Don't stall.
The other men were there, they know what happened.
They'll talk.
Will they?
Oh, no, Colonel.
Whatever Miller did, they're accessories to it.
Now, what are you gonna do, force it out of them, too, and then apologize?
Just talk. Fast.
There's no time anymore.
I just don't care. Well, you're gonna have to care.
What happened after
Connors was killed?
You're wasting your time.
Talk!
Please, Colonel Edwards.
It wouldn't do any good.
Please,
Colonel Edwards.
Let me in there, please.
Colonel Edwards...
Lieutenant...
Only get them into trouble.
Believe me, they're good men, decent men.
But when the pressure got too much for them, they started killing each other.
Well, I can't condemn them for that.
I'm not condemning or condoning.
I'm only trying to help you.
All right, then tell me this.
What's gonna happen when they start putting pressure on the whole human race?
Did I see the beginning of the end, and am I the only one who knows it?
Sergeant? Colonel Edwards! Now, look, the only thing that counts now is the truth. When we...
All right, take it easy. Take it easy.
They're gonna try me for murder. All right. All right.
I'm not the only one.
We were all in it together.
Tell 'em. Tell 'em.
Knock that off, will you?
What's the matter with you? You too good for the rest of the world?
Too good to kill a lousy stool pigeon?
But in the end, you were the traitor. Not us.
Now they're gonna try me for murder, well, they won't.
What do you mean, murder?
Murder...
Who was murdered?
The lousy stool pigeon.
Miller, shut up.
Let him talk.
Look, sir, the man's in no condition to talk about anything.
We killed him, that's what about.
He told on some poor guy who was planning to escape and so we killed him. And your son, your wonderful son...
All right.
All right, come on.
Come on, Lieutenant.
Come on.
All right, Baker, get him out of here. Yeah.
What was he going to say?
Sir, the man was hysterical.
Anything he was going to say would have meant absolutely nothing.
You wouldn't have hit him if you didn't know what he was going to say.
It was something about my son planning to escape.
What was it?
It wouldn't do any good, sir.
Colonel, I'm ordering you to give me information relative to a case under my jurisdiction.
Do you refuse?
No, sir.
Very well, then.
The name of the man who betrayed my son.
You see what I mean about the truth?
You keep your clever remarks to yourself, Major.
Believe me, sir, I was not trying to be clever.
That's all for now, Cargill.
You're excused.
Just a moment, Major.
You feel pretty safe and smug here, don't you, Cargill?
Hiding behind due process of law. Please, sir.
It galls me to see traitors like you being coddled here.
Sir, I beg you to leave this man alone.
Suppose you tell me who betrayed my son, Major?
I insist you leave him alone.
I'm interrogating him,
Colonel.
All right, Major.
Who was it?
Who betrayed my son?
I...
I can't answer that, sir.
Can't you? Honor among traitors, is that it?
One dirty swine protecting another? One lousy collaborating...
Damn it, sir, stop it!
I'm sorry, sir.
But I...
I just couldn't let you go on that way. Not without knowing the truth.
Your son wasn't betrayed.
He wasn't killed by the enemy.
He was killed by his own men.
He was the stool pigeon.
It's a lie.
No, sir. It's the truth.
It's a lie you made up to protect this man.
It's the truth, sir.
You have no proof.
I have.
Conclusive proof.
Every man has his limit, sir.
There's no crime in being human.
He was my son.
He was raised to know better, to be better.
I can't forgive cowardice, especially in my own son.
Why?
That's right. Why?
Why are we always so much quicker to blame those we love rather than those we hate?
Is it because weakness in them is somehow weakness in ourselves?
Is that it?
I didn't love your son, General, but I didn't hate him, either.
So maybe I'll be allowed to speak a few words on his behalf.
A man can be a hero all his life, but if in the last month of it or the last week or even the last minute, the pressure becomes too great and he breaks, then he's branded for life.
You can't ask a man to be a hero forever.
There ought to be a time limit.
There is no defense for treason.
I wouldn't use words like treason if I were you.
And I would never set myself up to judge anybody.
Just don't be a hero on somebody else's time, General.
And don't ever hate a man for what he does under pressure.
Your son was a hero.
I give you my word.
Hundreds of days he was a hero.
And only one day did he break.
Well, in the name of God, aren't all those other days worth something?
Does he lose his standing in the human race because he broke on that one last day?
They didn't understand, so they killed him.
But at least they thought they had a reason.
To save their lives.
But what reason have you got,
General? A set of rules, a code?
Well, it's not enough.
Because you don't have a code that fits a man to face them.
Your code doesn't have all the answers. Not all the answers.
All right, Major, you've said enough.
No, sir,
I've not said enough.
Your son was a human being, and somebody's going to speak for him.
My son is dead.
And there's a dignity in that, no matter how he died.
But you, Major, are alive.
And I'll be damned if I'll stand here and allow you to attack a code that better men than you have lived and died by.
The Code? The... How much does the Code ask of a man?
Everything, if the man is a soldier. His life.
His life? You think that's the most that a man can lose?
What are you talking about?
I'll tell you.
I'll tell you what
I'm talking about.
You're in a prison camp.
Nobody breaks.
Months and months of cold and torture and starvation and nobody breaks.
And then one day, a man does break and his own men kill him for it.
And the commander of the camp is furious because he's been robbed of the one victory he's been able to achieve.
So he calls in the ranking officer and he says to him,
"I have reached the limit of my patience.
"Either you cooperate or
I kill all sixteen men."
What would you do,
General, huh?
I want an answer.
What would you do?
Stand fast?
Let them all be killed?
That is a chance you have to take.
Maybe. Maybe.
Maybe that's the answer, for heroes.
But I was no hero.
I couldn't take that chance.
To me, those sixteen men, the wives, the families, they seemed important.
They still seem important.
How many lies for a man's life, huh?
I don't know. I just gave them everything they wanted.
Everything.
I had a feeling, sir.
On his record, he wasn't the kind of man who'd do something like this for a selfish reason.
He couldn't defend himself without incriminating sixteen other men.
I'm sorry about this man and everything that's happened to him.
And it's precisely because I'm sorry that I know why we need the Code.
I want your recommendation at once.
General, this is an extremely harsh application of the rule.
Is it?
This man's had it.
No man's exempt.
Not this man, not my son, no one.
Because after you've said everything that could be said, the fact would remain, he did help the enemy.
Sir, I think it's only fair to tell you, if he's brought to trial,
I'd like to defend him.
That's your privilege, Bill.
Major Cargill, you asked me a question.
You at least deserve an answer.
The choice that you had to make in that prison camp was no different than the choice that confronts every military leader.
The decision involving the life or death of his men.
You're a sensitive man.
A humane man.
I sympathize with that man.
But you're also a soldier.
And as a soldier, you have failed, just as my son failed.
You talk to me of sixteen men.
Multiply that by thousands. Try carrying that weight on your shoulders.
Try sleeping with the cries of those wives and children in your ears.
I've done that, Major.
Every wartime commander has done it.
Because until a better world is built, it's got to be done.
That is why we have the Code,
Major.
The Code is our Bible and thank God for it.
I'll be waiting for your recommendation, Bill.
Under the circumstances,
I will, of course, disqualify myself.
The General's right.
I was wrong and
I should be tried.
Reasons don't matter.
Reasons do matter.
When a man's mind is attacked, how does he protect himself?
How does he fight back?
You didn't tell the other men why you went over, did you?
Part of your deal with Colonel Kim?
Evans, take this, will you?
Concerning the charges in the case of Major Harry Cargill, recommendation is as follows.
Considerable evidence has been amassed to prove that Major Cargill willingly collaborated with the enemy.
There is now also evidence to indicate that he did so unselfishly and to preserve the lives of his fellow prisoners.
Although he was mistaken in his judgment, he was surely no traitor.
Therefore, I personally recommend that all charges be dropped and no court-martial be convened.
Now, don't let that recommendation fool you.
There'll be a court-martial.
Oh, I expect that.
It's just good to know that somebody understands.
Well, we've got a long way to go.
Can you be here tomorrow morning?
Yes, sir, I'll be here.
We free at 8:00, Evans?
Yes, sir, we're free.
8:00, then.
And, Major, give my regards to your wife.
Yes, sir.
Colonel, do you think we can get the answers this way?
Well, I can promise you one thing, Major.
They'll know we asked the questions.
- Hello?
- I raise 2,000.
One second, please.
I raise 5,000.
Someone wants to talk to Professor Hervé Dandieu.
- Two pair, aces up.
- That's it.
- Yes?
- I could have bluffed you.
That's quite impossible at this time of night.
If you were one of my patients...
Tell him it's for me!
I'll tell him.
It's for Mr Decauville-Lachenée.
Decauville-Lachenée? I don't know him.
Please, Mr Dandieu.
My father is in terrible pain.
You know what toothache is like.
If only you'd be good enough...
Very well, you can come.
- Another 15,000.
- OK.
- 15,000 more.
- I'll stake the lot.
- Flush!
- Damn! I was sure he was bluffing!
Wait a minute!
Straight flush.
Just a second, I'll be right back.
Come into the surgery.
Thank you.
Open wide.
It must be a large cavity.
It's probably affecting the nerve, which would explain...
- You're interested in dentistry?
- Very much.
It's the first time you've set foot in a dentist's surgery!
I'm not surprised.
Your daughter has splendid teeth.
- You think so?
- Yes.
They complement your mouth... and everything else too.
You should have come to see me sooner.
Your tooth's in a bad way.
Don't stand there, Virginie.
I hate people looking in my mouth.
I didn't wait for you to treat me.
My dentist is Prof Aïdé Gaudard.
- The bridge is old-fashioned.
- I'm very happy with it.
Open wide.
- I'll have to take the tooth out.
- Absolutely not.
It's the only solution.
I forbid you to touch it.
Give me something for the pain.
I can knock you out with painkillers if you wish.
You should trust Mr Dandieu.
He seems very good at his job.
Be quiet.
My daughter is engaged to a young man of whom I entirely approve.
So don't get your hopes up.
- What are you doing?
- A filling.
- I won't hear of it.
- It's very quick.
If you move, I could hurt you.
Open wide.
- Are you really engaged?
- Yes, really.
Incredible, I had the seven of diamonds, and the swine trumped me with two Jacks.
- Something wonderful's happened.
- What?
- I've met the woman of my dreams.
- What?
She's here in my surgery.
What a business.
Pity you brought me to a dentist who's an alcoholic.
- Not at all.
- Didn't you smell the alcohol?
I don't like him.
He looks like a butcher's boy.
Or an ox-driver.
That's it. An ox-driver.
- I think he's great.
- Are you mad?
Exactly the kind of man I need.
Don't look so glum, Albert.
My son-in-law looks like a butcher's boy.
You look like a monkey.
Make an effort. Congratulate them.
So that's it, then.
I hope you'll make her happy.
You're just a spoilt child!
You poke your nose in where you've no business to.
Just because you got a silly diploma.
I could have one too if I wanted.
Pass your exams and give me some peace!
If you're so keen, get your father to buy you a surgery, and stop interfering with my patients!
I've never been interested in dentistry.
It's one of the minor professions.
- What are you doing?
- Leaving.
I won't stay a minute more with such a brute.
If you walk through that door, everything's over between us.
Good riddance!
You're just a pain in the neck!
What's bred in the bone comes out in the flesh.
- Spoilt brat!
- Useless dentist!
Dinner is served.
I shan't be eating at home.
- Do you come here often, madame?
- My name's Anita.
- Do you come here often, Anita?
- Very.
You can meet very nice people here.
Are you married?
Yes. To a wonderful woman.
I don't know why she was even interested in me.
Why isn't she here with you?
We had an argument.
A silly argument, you know.
- Like all arguments.
- That's right.
Come and dance.
It'll make you feel better.
- I'm married too.
- Do you love your husband?
- He's a failure and a moron.
- I see.
- You're an amazingly good dancer.
- I'm a dance teacher.
Anita Florès Dance School.
That's me.
- You must think I'm a terrible dancer.
- You could do with some lessons.
Come and see us.
Good evening, monsieur.
How are you?
Have you reserved me a table?
- Oh, my God.
- What is it?
My father-in-law.
If he sees me, I've had it.
And I've never cheated on my wife.
- We're doing nothing wrong.
- My father-in-law hates me.
- Has he seen us?
- No, you're completely hidden.
Let's go.
Give me those keys.
If you agree to a last drink at my place.
- You're very stubborn.
- I know.
All right.
I'll stay for five minutes, but not any longer.
Five minutes, that's a promise.
I slipped into something more comfortable.
You must be tired, I'll be off.
Not at all.
Let's talk for another five minutes.
I'm not sleepy at all.
You smell good.
Are you feeling fine?
I feel fine with you.
Darling...
My darling...
Don't you like me?
Yes, very much.
Maybe if I'd met you a few months ago, but like I said, I adore my wife.
It may sound silly, but I've never cheated on her.
No, a faithful husband is very sweet.
Your wife trusts you, you trust her.
If she knew you'd cheated, especially with someone like me, it would change everything.
Maybe. I don't know.
- Have you been married long?
- Three months.
Off you go, you bad boy.
Thank you for your charming welcome.
Thanks to you,
I've had a lovely evening.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
- Are the photos any good?
- One or two are quite amusing.
When he took your breast, for example.
You didn't have much fun, Léon.
Who's the guy?
A newly-married dentist, an idiot, with a rich father-in-law.
Could be interesting.
You scared me.
Where have you been?
If you say with your father,
I won't believe you.
- Why? Did you phone him?
- No.
- What time is it?
- 3.30 am.
Amazing.
- You won't say where you've been?
- What about you?
- I didn't go out.
- Poor Hervé must have been bored!
- He was horrid to his wife.
- Don't change the subject.
I asked you a question.
Answer me.
If I tell you, you'll be furious.
I went to the Sexy Club, where you wouldn't take me.
- What?!
- The striptease was so risqué!
The men were so excited, they were shouting.
You went to a place like that on your own?
You'd rather I went with someone else?
Are you angry? I promise
I'll never go out alone again.
Come to bed. I'm very tired.
- Are you?
- Not at all. Where are you going?
To brush my hair.
Do you really have to?
No.
- Do you love me?
- Yes.
No one but me?
No one but you.
- We'll never argue again.
- Never, I promise.
I was unhappy all evening.
Me too.
I thought of you all the way through the striptease.
I adore you.
- What are you doing?
- I'm looking at you.
You're very handsome.
And to think it's all mine.
Mine alone.
You see, darling...
...if men did striptease, you'd be a big star.
You're an idiot, my darling.
Come here.
It's true, you know.
Everyone raves about women's bodies.
I think men's bodies are much more desirable, don't you?
I think it's the other way round.
Really? Do you find me desirable?
Hadn't you noticed?
Isn't life wonderful?
That's it. I didn't hurt you, did I?
This way.
Next!
Your next patient's quite a pin-up!
Hello?
- Good morning.
- Just one moment.
It's Mme Witta.
Will her fitting be ready by Monday?
Yes, tell her she can come.
- That's my wife.
- She's very beautiful.
She knows nothing about our evening together.
I'm very flattered that you came to see me but...
If you need a dentist
I can recommend a good one.
No need, I don't have toothache.
I came to show you something.
I'm sure you'll be interested.
Virginie, can you fetch Madame's files?
She's an old patient.
- Madame?
- Florès. Anita Florès.
You tart! Don't think
I'll fall for your trick!
I advise you not to speak to me like that.
Unless you'd like me to show these photos to your lovely wife?
Or your father-in-law, perhaps.
I'm sure Mr Decauville-Lachenée would love to see them.
I'll expect you tomorrow at the school.
We can talk business in private.
Do you remember?
I promised I'd give you some lessons.
I looked everywhere but I can't find her file.
Has your patient left already?
Crazy woman, she didn't have toothache.
I don't know why she came.
Poor darling, if only you could see how funny you look!
Really?
- Listen, Virginie.
- Yes?
Bring in the next patient.
MODERN AND CLASSIC DANCE
One, two... very good.
I'd rather die than give you the money.
You won't get a penny!
You seem determined to cause a row.
You piece of dirt!
Give me those photos back right now!
- Do you think we should intervene?
- It's nothing important.
- Mr Florès.
- What is it?
Your wife's having trouble.
We should see if she's OK.
I never interfere in my wife's business.
Go and see if you want.
One, two...
That's perfect, very good.
You filthy trickster!
Give me those photos!
- What's going on?
- The boss is having trouble.
- I don't have them!
- Is everything all right?
Next time, I'll give you a good slap!
You know my studio is out of bounds when I'm teaching.
Yes, but we thought...
As for you, Daisy.
No need to be so keen.
You'll be leaving at the end of the month.
- Did Mme Leclerc come at 6 pm?
- She said she couldn't make it.
- What time did she call?
- At about 5 pm.
Perfect. Charge her for it.
She should have cancelled earlier.
Yes, madame.
- You wish Daddy hadn't come?
- No, I don't mind.
- Do you love me?
- Yes.
- No one but me?
- No one but you.
For you, Hervé.
It's Anita Florès.
Anita Florès? Your patient?
I'll take the call in my office.
Keep your father company.
I'll be right back.
Good evening, Mr Dandieu.
Daddy!
- I hope you're in a better mood.
- I told you not to call here.
- As I thought. He has a mistress.
- It's not true.
I'll expect you at 7.30 pm tomorrow.
We can talk once the classes are over.
Your volcanic temperament makes me nervous.
See you tomorrow, Mr Dandieu.
I'll be expecting you.
What do you think? Shall we ask him to explain his mysterious rendezvous?
It's my business.
I'll deal with it myself.
- Bye, Mr Florès.
- Goodbye.
I may be late.
I have another lesson to teach.
Oh, it's you. Just a second.
See you later, my love.
Lots of kisses.
Yes, I love you.
I'm leaving. Will you be dining at home this evening?
- No, I'm going out.
- Fine.
Come in.
Daniel, you've come to ask for money, I suppose.
Bad timing, I'm expecting someone.
- Do you have your lesson vouchers?
- Yes, madame.
Hey, put this notice up before you go.
WANTED: FEMALE DANCE TEACHER
So she didn't pay you for your overtime?
It's like getting blood from a stone.
I'll try again tomorrow.
- Is that the guy who came yesterday?
- That's him.
- Maybe I should stop him.
- Go on.
- Can I help you?
- I've an appointment with Mme Florès.
Very well. I'll let her know.
Madame Florès. There's a gentleman who says he has an appointment.
I'll send him up, but I thought...
It's the man who came yesterday.
Very well.
Mme Florès is expecting you.
- What are you doing here?
- And you?
What are you doing with that gun?
Where's your mistress?
- She's never been my mistress, I swear.
- Then tell me what you're doing here.
I came for dance lessons.
I wanted to surprise you.
It's not the time for questions.
I've enough on my plate.
- Help!
- Quiet!
Give the keys to Mme Florès so she can lock up.
OK.
It was you! You killed her!
- Mme Florès!
- Hervé...!
Mme Florès!
Mme Florès, I'm leaving now.
Shall I leave the keys on the table?
Good evening, Mme Anita.
I'll see you tomorrow.
He's gone, and we're safe.
We'll wait a while before we go.
I'm in a terrible position.
I swear I didn't kill her.
She was already dead when I entered the room.
I found her there, next to the phone.
She must have been killed a few minutes before I came in.
Don't you believe me?
Yes, darling, I believe you.
But I was watching the door and no one came in here except you.
Maybe there's another door?
Take a look.
There is no other door.
Isn't that odd?
I don't understand it either.
The Mystery of the Yellow Room.
No one went in, no one came out.
Unless... Unless he got out through the window! That's it!
There's no window!
Don't look at me like that!
I didn't kill her!
Hurry! The murderer is still in the building!
- What is it?
- Murder!
Yes, Florès Dance School,
10 rue du Foire.
Just after the public park.
Come on, we have to go.
This way! Hurry!
Who could have imagined such a thing?
I'm devastated!
- Have you got all the photos?
- Yes, Inspector.
Take away the body.
- Goodbye, Inspector.
- Goodbye, doctor.
Fine, you may go.
Should I send the pupils away?
As you wish. It's not my business.
What shall we do?
I'm incapable of giving a lesson today.
Who could dance in such circumstances?
But if the pupils are here, carry on.
We must be strong.
I have to leave, I have a meeting.
The dentist is busy but he'll see you as soon as possible.
You say you didn't kill her and I believe you but...
Daddy! He's got enough on his plate as it is!
But how did you get mixed up in this?
- You shouldn't have gone to that club.
- It's all my fault.
If we hadn't argued, he'd never have met that woman.
Don't you know you could be arrested any minute?
- What?
- Hervé's in all the papers.
- Impossible.
- You are!
"The murderer: A fit man aged 30-35 blue eyes, brown hair, good looking, wearing a grey suit, escaped police by fleeing over the rooftops."
- That's amazing.
- What?
- We got out through the gardens.
- She's right.
The man who went over the roof must be the murderer.
The mystery is solved. The murderer shot her through the air vent.
To think the police could be following a false trail!
We have to do something.
Perfect! That's enough tango.
Time to look at the other dances.
That's an interesting vent.
You think so?
It's an air vent.
There's one in every studio.
- Is it easy to clean?
- Sorry?
I mean, for cleaning.
It's hard to reach.
How do you get up there?
I've no idea.
I've never even thought about it.
This mambo is a great favourite with our pupils.
- You have a very good technique.
- Really?
I've never seen that step.
I just do it any old way.
What hair! What legs! What a waist!
The lady's here to apply for the job.
I think we can take her on trial.
I think that's an excellent idea.
- What's your name?
- Fernande.
- You're not afraid of work?
- Not at all, I love dancing.
Good.
You'll have plenty of opportunity.
One, two, three, four...
No! One, two, three, four, together.
- I'll never get it.
- You will.
One, two, three, four.
It's not bad for your first lesson.
Practise in front of the mirror,
I'll be watching.
Go on, carry on!
One, two, three, four!
After you, Inspector.
Hello, Inspector.
Don't let us disturb you.
Carry on.
We've got all the names.
None of them match the description.
- He's not a pupil.
- Probably not.
What...?
One, two, three, four...
Who is that young lady?
- A new teacher.
- Why didn't we interview her?
She only started the job this morning.
I've asked for an office to be made available to us on the ground floor.
- Sorry to disturb you.
- You didn't disturb me at all.
You've got a fan.
She couldn't take her eyes off you.
Really? I didn't notice.
- I love be-bop, don't you?
- Yes.
One more time? We still have 15 minutes.
- Aren't you a bit tired?
- Not at all.
Rest for a minute.
I'll be right back.
Where are you going?
- Is your lesson over?
- No, I've 15 minutes left.
- Go back to your studio.
- I haven't had a rest all day.
You can rest in your lunch hour.
Get back to work.
There you are!
You're a bit jumpy today.
Even dentists have worries, madame.
- It's your wife.
- At last. Excuse me.
Virginie? Where are you?
I'm in Anita Florès's studio.
I've got a job as a teacher.
- You're crazy! Come home!
- Please, don't shout.
Do you think I want to be here?
My feet are killing me.
I'm almost sure that the murderer shot her through the vent.
I'll call you back later.
Virginie!
It's no laughing matter, madame.
- Are you there, boss?
- I'm here.
- How was your walk on the roof?
- Nothing new to report.
After he was surprised by the barman, the murderer got down via the service stairs next door.
Nice place this, isn't it?
The barman said Mr Florès came up here to watch the girls in the shower.
Lucky guy!
Plenty of pretty girls here.
- Did he look through here?
- It's nothing to do with our inquiry.
Come on, this way.
- Have you talked to the Inspector?
- No.
You must!
They'll never find him otherwise.
No, I can't.
If I talk to the Inspector, he'll know my wife told me and I must keep that quiet.
I've got a better idea. Look.
An anonymous letter giving the Inspector the name of the man he's looking for.
Excellent idea. Give it to me.
The Inspector's at lunch. He'll find it on his desk when he comes back.
What have we got to lose?
Excuse me, Inspector,
I've taken over your office.
I didn't think you'd be back from lunch so quickly.
Excuse me.
- It's very bad...
- What's bad?
...to eat lunch too quickly.
I know, but in this job one's always in a hurry.
- Are you married, Inspector?
- Widowed.
Widowed?
Have you lost something?
My glasses.
I'm sure I left them on the desk.
Your glasses...
Here they are.
You're very imposing in glasses.
It changes you completely.
You look much more serious.
If I'd met you in the street,
I'd never have guessed your job.
I'd always imagined police inspectors to be much older and much less attractive.
- I'd have liked to be an Inspector.
- Really?
I read a lot of detective novels and I almost always guess the murderer.
Come in!
If you don't need me again,
I'll be leaving.
I will be needing you later.
I wasn't due to work today.
I'm rehearsing a show.
You can rehearse later,
I won't keep you long.
- You asked for me?
- Yes. Sit down and I'll be with you.
I'll call for you later. Please leave.
- Me too?
- You too.
- So, you're maintaining your position?
- I don't understand.
This morning you said you had no knowledge of your wife's... extra-curricular activities.
- You didn't know about the blackmail?
- Blackmail?
That's impossible.
I've never heard anything about that.
I've just about had enough of these cops.
- Wasn't the Inspector rude to me?
- Yes, I noticed.
You know something? I think he suspects you're the murderer.
Everyone knows who the murderer is.
The man who had an appointment, who came and caused a row.
No, it wasn't him.
Apparently, that's a false lead.
Don't tell the Inspector I said so.
- That's incredible. Are you sure?
- Absolutely.
- Of course, I should know.
- Really?
The Inspector told me.
The murderer shot Anita through the air vent in the studio.
That's extraordinary.
You think the Inspector suspects me?
No, he suspects everyone.
You, Mr Florès, Daisy...
The barman.
But the barman rang the police.
What does that prove?
It was a set-up.
I can understand why they suspect
Mr Florès and Daisy. They had a motive.
- Really?
- I don't know, probably.
I had no motive. I wasn't her lover and I didn't stand to inherit.
- I know why he suspects me.
- Why?
- Because of my morals.
- What are your morals?
- Don't tell me you hadn't noticed?
- Not at all.
That's the way it is.
I don't like women.
- Not at all?
- Not at all, I swear.
You're very pretty and very nice.
But I don't want to kiss you.
- No?
- I'd have to force myself.
- I haven't offended you?
- Of course not.
I understand.
Everyone's free to do what they like.
You should have seen the Inspector when he found out
I work at the Fétiche Bleu.
What's that?
A club that's not at all suitable for young ladies.
- Sounds great!
- You're great too.
- Go on!
- I don't want to.
Going in there would be madness.
Let's go home and wait for Virginie.
There's no danger.
You've never been to the school.
No-one will suspect you, so you can ask for lessons.
You think I feel like dancing?
My daughter and I are in an impossible situation.
I wouldn't be at all surprised if you had murdered that woman.
You could at least have left me out of it.
We never intended to involve you.
We knew you'd never help us out if we were in trouble.
Don't you know it's illegal to double park?
Do you have your driving licence?
One, two, one, two, three...
Mr Florès, the Inspector wants you in his office.
- You two try dancing together.
- I can't keep interrupting lessons.
Impossible! I'll come right away.
- They've found their man.
- Impossible!
He's in the Inspector's office.
We just need to identify him.
Carry on with the lesson.
I'll be back.
Take a good look before you say anything.
Remember this is a murder case.
Any accusation will be a very serious matter.
Bring him in.
What's this about?
I was picked up at Orly.
I wasn't allowed to change.
Would you take off your cap, please?
- Well?
- It's not him.
- And you?
- It's not him.
Do you recognise him?
No, I've never seen him before.
Very well, you may leave.
You can stay.
I have some questions for you.
Don't think you've got away with it.
Just because you've not been identified doesn't make you innocent.
I don't know what you mean, but you're utterly charming.
- What are you doing here?
- I want to tell you something.
Mr Florès is looking for you to finish the lesson.
I haven't stopped dancing all day.
I'm only human after all.
Wait for me there.
Sorry to have kept you, but in view of your unusual relationship...
...your unusual relationship with the victim, we wanted to verify your alibi.
Relationship?
I met that woman three times, but only because I had to.
I never liked Mme Florès.
That's why I called you in.
If I hadn't been in New York at the time of the crime, you might have arrested me.
We don't arrest people so easily, you can be sure of that.
Goodbye, mademoiselle.
This mambo is very slow. It will be much easier for a beginner like you.
No, monsieur! Learning to dance requires a little concentration.
I can't imagine why you came.
If you don't listen to my instructions you won't make any progress.
We're going to start again with the mambo.
Put your weight on one foot, then on the other.
Don't be afraid to exaggerate the hips.
We can correct that later.
No, watch...
At last! And about time.
So you're back.
I told you not to leave your studio.
- I had to teach this gentleman for you.
- I'm very sorry.
I can continue the lesson, if monsieur doesn't mind.
In view of the stage I'm at,
I don't mind changing teachers.
In fact, I'd prefer it.
I see. Perfect, as you wish.
Let's carry on.
- You're crazy to come here!
- Your idiot husband forced me.
He's in a terrible state.
You must come home!
I won't come home until I find the murderer.
What you just told me is incredible!
- Is the young woman back in her studio?
- Yes, she's there.
Ridiculous! I never said the mystery man was not the murderer.
Nor did I say I suspected you or the other teachers.
And as for suspecting the barman, that's ridiculous.
I thought I should tell you.
This matter of the air vent...
- Isn't it rather strange?
- Indeed it is.
- It's not your husband's name.
- What?!
"The murderer is Gérard Lalemand."
I can't believe it!
Can it really be true?
Could I speak to you for a moment, mademoiselle?
Inspector, I have some important news.
I think we've got him this time.
Come this way.
I think we're being watched.
Listen, mademoiselle...
Hello.
Listen to me, Inspector.
The murderer is Gérard Lalemand of 59, Avenue de Versailles.
What do you say?
I've been very patient with you but that's enough.
But I thought you were so sweet.
I wish you'd talk sense but all you do is talk rubbish.
- Really?
- For example, you say the murderer is not the man seen next to Mme Florès.
Exactly! The murderer shot her through the vent.
Let me show you.
I see she's told you her version of the crime too.
She'll end up driving us all mad.
I was just examining the vent.
It's as good a theory as any other.
Tests show the shot was fired at point-blank range.
- The murderer was in this room.
- Are you sure?
Absolutely. Our experts never make a mistake.
The Mystery of the Yellow Room.
There is no Yellow Room Mystery in this case.
She's determined to have a mystery when there isn't one.
There you are. Where's Virginie?
I've waited an hour.
Why should he be seen before me?
- It's an emergency.
- I'm an emergency!
I'm his father-in-law.
But what's it to do with you?
Wait your turn and you'll be called.
- So where is Virginie?
- Still at the school.
- She refused to leave.
- So you can't be relied on.
What a cheek! You don't realise the risk I ran by going in there.
I had to dance the mambo for over an hour, at my age, and in front of the Inspector, who thought I was an old goat.
Tell the dentist I'm never coming back.
My appointment was at 4 pm!
Virginie is stubborn, she's determined to prove you innocent.
She discovered a cupboard where they keep records.
It's so small, the murderer could never have hidden inside it.
What are you doing?!
I won't! Help!
- Help! Let me out!
- Why are you shouting like that?
- I didn't hurt you, did I?
- I won't go into the cupboard!
Help!
Are you mad? Look what you've done!
- You horrid little telltale!
- She tried to shut me in there!
That's enough! You were on trial but we shan't be keeping you on.
- Are you quite sure?
- You can ask the witness yourself.
- It must be a mistake.
- The descriptions don't match.
The man who fled over the roof is not the same as the man in the studio.
Instead of one suspect, we have two.
That's perfect.
Bring me the new dance teacher.
- The pin-up?
- Yes. I have several questions for her.
She's been making fun of me.
Do you think so? She seems very sweet.
- She's been chatting you up too?
- We just talked a little.
- The young lady has just left.
- What?
- Has she gone?
- I sacked her.
The pupils complained about her.
She shouldn't be hard to find.
What's her name?
She told me her name was Fernande.
That's all I know.
You employ people without even asking their name?
She was on trial. I'd have got her name if I'd given her the job.
I bet it was a false name.
She doesn't look like a Fernande.
The hussy tricked us.
- Hello?
- Is this Mr Lalemand's residence?
- Yes, speaking.
- I'm phoning on behalf of Anita Florès.
On behalf of Anita Florès.
Yes, I heard you.
On behalf of Anita Florès.
I can reveal important information about her murder.
But we must meet face to face.
Whenever you like.
I would invite you here, but it might be better to meet in a café.
Thank you, Clémence. And don't forget to close the door. There's a draught.
Very good, sir.
Shall we meet in Versailles Bar in half an hour? It's near your house.
- I'll be there.
- How will I recognise you?
I have blue eyes, and white hair in a crew cut.
I'm sure to recognise you.
9.30 pm at the Versailles Bar.
See you there.
I forbid you to go and meet him.
Dry your feet!
There's water everywhere!
I've a bad feeling about it, don't go.
I won't be in any danger.
He doesn't know me.
- And don't wear that dress!
- Yes, I will.
You don't like it, but I do.
It's grotesque, it's completely indecent.
- That's why I'm wearing it.
- So this man can see your breasts?
It won't do any harm in the circumstances.
- You could go completely naked.
- I'd love to.
When I'm naked,
I lose all my inhibitions.
You can't understand, you're not a woman.
It's not easy being a woman.
Men are so much stronger.
We have to use our own little weapons.
Yours aren't so little, darling.
Give me a hand.
- Hello?
- Mr Dandieu?
- I'd like to see you, Mr Dandieu.
- What about?
I was a close friend of poor Anita.
You were due to give her 500,000 to get your photos back?
You foolishly refused to pay.
Now the police are looking for you and the price is going up.
Tell the police and go to hell!
I didn't kill Anita!
If I were you, Mr Dandieu, I think...
Carry on, my friend.
It's very interesting.
Hello?!
You were on the roof after the crime.
The witnesses saw you.
I didn't kill her.
Be careful. Your blackmail business is going to cost you dear.
Mr Dandieu did it, not me.
How are you so sure?
Because I was there.
I knew Anita was due to get the money.
She always tried to cheat me out of my cut.
So I hid above her studio to watch him hand over the money.
And for once,
Anita had an unlucky break.
When I got there, the dentist was already cleaning his gun.
- You didn't shout or do anything?
- She was already dead.
What would be the point of shouting?
I realised I was in danger and so I scarpered.
You tried to profit from the situation.
I wanted the money.
You won't need money now.
Prison life doesn't cost a thing.
It's you! What a fright you gave me!
- Take your sunglasses off.
- I don't think your man's coming.
It's not looking good.
A guy called and threatened to tell the police about me.
I tried bluffing and it seemed to work.
He hung up immediately.
But I'm still worried.
Did someone here have an appointment with a Lalemand?
Mr Lalemand? That's me.
He won't be able to make it.
- He didn't leave any other message?
- No madame.
Thank you.
That's odd.
I was sure he wouldn't come.
Sorry I took so long to open the door.
I always lock up when I'm here alone.
What a lovely portrait!
I recognised it immediately.
It's Mr Lalemand, isn't it?
Yes... I served Mr Lalemand for over 40 years, mademoiselle.
I had an appointment with him earlier but he wasn't able to come.
- Why are you looking at me like that?
- Because...
- Because what you say is impossible.
- Why is it impossible?
Because... Mr Lalemand is dead, mademoiselle.
He's been dead for three years.
I don't understand. I spoke to him on the phone and made an appointment.
You must have spoken to Mr Gérard, poor Mr Lalemand's son.
His son? So why did he give me a description of this portrait?
That's the way he is.
He has no respect.
Not even for his father's memory.
I don't know Mr Gérard, but it would seem he doesn't like you.
He'd like to see me dead.
I know far too much, mademoiselle.
Yes, I heard he planned to let you go, and since I'm looking for a job...
Look elsewhere.
Mr Gérard is a swine.
Now he's going to be rich, he wants to get rid of me.
Rich?
He's due to inherit 50 million, that's all I know.
So he won't need to work any more?
Not that he did much work.
He changed jobs all the time.
- He even changed his name.
- Really?
At one time, Mr Gérard decided to go into the theatre.
Apparently, he's a very good dancer.
But in reality, the theatre was just a pretext to meet other young men like him.
Young men with the same kind of morals, if you know what I mean.
Yes, I do. But I'd like to know...
Excuse me.
Hello? Yes, sir...
That's right, the girl who's taking my place.
I would have preferred monsieur to have told me personally...
What? But the girl told me...!
No, monsieur...
Yes.
Go away! You lied to me!
You made me talk! Go away!
I assure you, it's very important.
It's about the murder of Anita Florès!
Anita Florès is dead?!
She's dead! Go away!
Anita Florès is dead!
Go away!
Mr Florès? I have some questions for you from Inspector Marchal.
- I'm his deputy.
- Yes, of course.
I wanted to ask you, do you know a certain Gérard Lalemand?
No, I don't know him.
But you and your mistress sent us an anonymous letter this afternoon.
The police are well-informed.
It's true, I accused him.
But I didn't know him.
My wife often talked about him.
I thought he was the murderer, but I was mistaken.
I just wanted to help the police.
You knew Gérard Lalemand, but perhaps he worked at the school under another name?
- Daniel, for example.
- What?
It's not the police, it's a trap!
What does it mean?
Hello? He hung up.
Police.
- Mr Dandieu, please.
- There's nobody home.
Monsieur and madame are out.
Little hussy, she tricked us!
What are you doing here?
- I am Mr Dandieu's father-in-law.
- I see.
- You operate as a family, I take it?
- Leave us, Mathilde.
- I'm so glad you came, Inspector.
- Really?
I'm at the end of my tether.
I was coming to see you.
- You should have, Mr...?
- Decauville-Lachenée, industrialist.
Your silence puts you in a very difficult position.
A scotch, please.
Thank you.
What are you doing here, Mme Dandieu?
You can't scare me, you know.
What would you do if I told the police you stole money from my bag?
Please, don't tell.
I'm married with three children.
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Fétiche Bleu.
Do you know a man called Gérard Lalemand?
- I've never heard the name.
- He murdered Anita Florès.
...the very charming Danielle.
- Is that Daniel?
- Yes. He does a transvestite turn.
Daniel's not his real name, it's Gérard Lalemand.
You're not in bed yet?
What's wrong?
Your father-in-law is in the sitting-room.
Sorry, I didn't know you were coming.
I must speak to you, it's very important.
- Where's Virginie?
- At the Fétiche Bleu.
She found out Gérard Lalemand didn't like women and deduced he killed Anita.
Don't try to understand.
You don't look well.
You should go home to bed.
I have some very bad news for you.
Go ahead. I can take it.
It's like this...
- There was a witness to the murder.
- What?
Yes. A witness who saw the whole thing.
The witness saw the murderer kill Anita Florès?
- Yes.
- You call that bad news?
But it's a miracle, you idiot!
I'm so happy!
They know who did it and I'll be cleared!
Let me give you a hug.
I love you, Albert!
- Who are you?
- Inspector Marchal.
- Swine! You accused me!
- You're being very unfair.
He's tried to persuade us of your innocence.
That's not hard, since there's a witness to the murder.
Not to the murder, unfortunately.
We wanted to see your reaction.
Your father-in-law had the idea, and I could hardly refuse.
Albert, is it true you did that?
I always thought you were innocent.
You're not allowed backstage.
It's all right, she's a friend of mine.
All right.
Good evening. Have a seat.
Excuse me, I have to get ready for my next number.
- Are you well?
- Very well.
I'm sorry you didn't make our meeting.
We had a meeting?
I called you earlier and you gave me a false description.
I went to your house and your maid told me everything.
I know everything, Mr Lalemand.
- What did you call me?
- Gérard Lalemand.
- My name is Daniel.
- That's what you call yourself.
You women are complicated.
If my name's Daniel, why the devil call me Gérard?
Because Gérard's your real name.
Your father forbade you to go into the theatre, so you changed your name.
And you chose Daniel.
Nonsense. I've always been Daniel.
My father tours the provincial theatres, so I hardly needed his permission to become an actor.
All he asks is that I lend him money now and again.
- He didn't die three years ago?
- He's still around, unfortunately.
- That's terrible.
- You're telling me.
Especially since he started drinking, which doesn't help.
Don't look so worried.
You'll find Anita Florès's murderer.
I'd like to think so but I'm no longer so sure.
You're disappointed because I'm not the murderer.
If I don't find him, my husband will be arrested.
Really? And you have reasons to believe this Lalemand is guilty?
Absolutely. You can't imagine what his maid told me.
If I were you,
I'd do everything to find him.
The fact that he's avoiding you is a good sign.
- Maybe he's back home by now.
- Maybe.
I've got nothing to lose, after all.
Be careful. At this time of night, in a dress like that...
I don't have to worry.
Apparently he doesn't like women.
- Sorry...
- Don't worry, I don't mind.
- Daniel, you're on.
- I have to go on stage.
It was nice to see you.
I think you're very sweet.
It's true, I like you.
You're the first woman who's given me regrets.
Has he got long to go?
I've a few questions to ask him.
He's nearly finished.
- It's me again. Is monsieur at home?
- No. I'm begging you, go away!
- What's wrong, Clémence?
- It's the young lady who came earlier.
Show her in.
What?! Are you Gérard Lalemand?
I'm sorry that I couldn't make our appointment.
I was called to Orly on urgent business.
Go to bed, Clémence.
We shan't be needing you.
She's completely crazy.
She was in a terrible state after you told her Anita was dead.
Was your maid a relation of Anita Florès?
Absolutely not...
Anita Florès was my father's mistress.
I see... Was Anita Florès already married at that time?
Of course, to that despicable pimp, Florès.
Did you know that Mr Florès immediately thought you'd killed his wife?
That doesn't surprise me.
He doesn't have much imagination.
Anita's death is rather convenient for you, isn't it?
It seems you're to inherit 50 million.
No. The 50 million have been mine for three years.
- Really?
- Yes.
My father had principles.
He would never have disinherited his son in favour of his mistress.
So I inherited the 50 million.
Anita was to receive the interest on that money for her life-time.
You might say the money's no use if I can't touch it, and I would agree entirely.
Even so, I didn't kill her.
No doubt I had every reason to, but I didn't kill her.
Why are you so nervous?
What are you afraid of?
Afraid?
What should I be afraid of?
You, perhaps?
You're so pretty.
You found a way of getting rid of
Anita Florès without taking any risks.
And I'm going to find out how!
- May I answer the phone?
- Of course.
- Hello?
- Is that you, Gérard?
Why are you calling so late?
Things aren't looking good.
The thing we most feared just happened.
- Really?
- Your maid spilled the beans.
Soon the police will connect us.
I told you to get rid of that woman.
That witch is the only one who knew and now she's blabbed it.
Not at all, Françoise.
It didn't even occur to her.
I was worried for a moment but I've checked and everything's fine.
- You think so?
- You're wonderful, Françoise.
You always get worked up about nothing.
Relax! I'm telling you, there's nothing to worry about.
There's someone here at the moment, so I'll have to call you later...
You swine! You made me squawk and the maid hadn't said anything!
Don't worry, your mate can take the rap too, just like you wanted.
Why did I believe scum like you?
The photographer who saw everything was a lie too?
We had to make you talk somehow.
Take him away.
You dirty swine!
Run, Gérard! I landed you in it and the cops know everything.
Still here?
We've come to see Mr Lalemand.
- Where is he?
- Over there.
See to him.
- You didn't kill him, I hope?
- I thought it best to knock him out.
He was acting strangely on the phone, saying, "my little Françoise".
His maid said he didn't like women so it was fishy.
It doesn't take much for you to knock someone out.
But I was right, it was his accomplice on the phone.
And his accomplice is Daniel.
He killed Anita so his boyfriend could inherit the 50 million.
That woman is crazy, Inspector.
My friend Françoise Ranchon phoned me, you can check.
Françoise was calling you from my deputy's office.
Get your things.
You're coming with us.
- As for you, Mme Dandieu.
- Yes, Inspector?
Your husband's innocent, you don't have to turn on the charm.
I'm not any more.
I wanted to ask you, how did Daniel kill Anita?
- You haven't worked it out yet?
- No.
Think about it for a moment.
When your husband arrived at the dance school,
the murderer was watching him
from a window.
Daniel had long been waiting
for such an opportunity.
He'd seen your husband threaten Anita
in front of witnesses.
He knew Anita had another
appointment with him at 7.30 pm.
It's you, Daniel.
Daniel had only a few minutes
to execute his plan.
The plan enabled him to get rid of Anita
and pin the murder on someone
with every reason to kill her.
So she didn't pay you for your overtime?
It's like getting blood from a stone.
I'll try again tomorrow.
Is that the guy who came yesterday?
When your husband arrived,
Daniel made sure all the witnesses
thought Anita was still alive.
Madame, a gentleman says he has an appointment.
I'll send him up, but I thought...
It's the man who came yesterday.
Daniel had come up with a sort of perfect crime.
Especially as he was the only one who seemed to have no reason to kill her.
You worked it out yourself?
Of course, darling.
Is that really true?
No, it's not true.
The inspector told me!
Do you love me?
- No one but me?
- No one but you.
Dix Steele! How are you?
- Don't you remember me?
- No, I'm sorry. I can't say that I do.
You wrote the last picture I did at Columbia.
I never see pictures I write.
You. Stop bothering my wife!
You shouldn't have done it. No matter how much money that pig's got.
- Pull over!
- What's wrong with right here?
- Evening, Mr. Steele.
- Hi, Dave.
- I'll put her right up front.
- Okay.
- Can I have your autograph?
- Who am I?
- I don't know.
- Don't bother, he's nobody.
She's right.
Dix! We'd about given you up.
- Hi, Mel.
- Where've you been?
- Come on. Buy us a drink.
- He's somebody.
Lloyd Barnes, big director. Made all his money before the income tax.
- We've been calling for three days.
- You know me...
...if I don't answer the third ring,
I'm not home.
- Hello, Dix. Lloyd.
- Hi, Max.
Honey, let me have that book I left here for Mr. Steele.
I'm almost finished.
Say "I like it," and you go on salary tomorrow.
Then I like it.
I think it'll make a dreamy picture.
An epic.
- What do you call an epic?
- A picture that's real long...
- ...and has lots of things going on.
- Could we have some matches?
Here you are. Mr. Steele, could I keep the book till you come out?
I only have a few pages to go.
- Sure, take your time.
- Thanks.
- Good evening, Mr. Steele.
- Evening.
- Remember, she's your audience.
- Say that again...
...I'll get another agent.
How are you, Charlie?
- Let's sit at the other end.
- What's wrong with right here?
- How are you, noble prince?
- Right well, thespian. Greg?
Gin and tonic.
What do you fellows want?
- A stinger.
- Glass of milk.
And a brandy for Mr. Waterman.
- Are you dining here or browsing?
- How's everything, Paul?
Just like show business, there is no business. Excuse me.
- Who's producing this?
- Bert Brody. Lloyd's directing.
You've got to work. You've been out of circulation too long.
I need money, you need the 10 percent.
For me, you don't have to go to work.
I've got my apartment, car, ulcers.
- Gasoline doesn't cost much.
- I won't do something I don't like.
- Dix, how many times must I tell you- - ?
- It's just another picture.
Can you really be choosy? You haven't had a hit since before the war.
Everybody makes flops except you.
You've remade the same picture...
...for 20 years.
You're a popcorn salesman.
That's right. So are you.
The difference is, I don't fight it.
- One day I'll write something good.
- Althea Bruce will do it.
- Althea Bruce- -
- You just have to follow the book.
- Remind me to buy you a new tie.
- Hi, kiddies!
What a picture I made!
Just back from the preview.
- Pasadena's out of its mind about it.
- Hello, Junior.
- No one walked out!
- Don't you shake hands with an actor?
You call this an actor?
He hasn't remembered a line for 10 years.
Made your father- in- law a couple of million.
- Pop made a star out of a drunkard.
- That is a menace.
Movie idol of the Roaring '20s.
Look at him.
Gazing into his crystal ball!
You have set the son- in- law business back 50 years.
- That's a dirty thing to-
- Stop! Hey, stop, Dix!
What's the matter with you?
Quiet down!
There goes Dix again.
- I'm leaving.
- Mel, take Charlie home, will you?
Come on.
Maybe I'd better stay.
No.
- You will read that book tonight?
- Yes, yes.
I'll drop by and wake you up in the morning. Around 10.
Make it about 11.
He had it coming, but next time will you please do it in the parking lot?
- I'll have some ham and eggs.
- I shall select the eggs personally.
Sit here and take it easy.
Dixon Steele!
- Hello, Fran. How are you?
- Between pictures.
Last night I couldn't sleep.
So, what did I do?
- Called up a lot of people.
- Just you. Where were you?
- Home.
- Don't you like to talk anymore?
- Not to people who have my number.
- Why don't you come over?
- I've got to read a book.
- Remember how I used to read to you?
Since then, I've learned to read by myself.
That's all. Do you look down on all women or just the ones you know?
I was pretty nice to you.
No, not to me. But you were pretty nice. I'll call you.
Thanks for letting me read it.
- What's your name?
- Mildred. Mildred Atkinson.
- Where do you live?
- In Inglewood, with my aunt.
- You got a car?
- No, I usually catch the bus.
- I'll drive you home.
- Thank you, but I have a date.
- Well, break it.
- I can't.
Besides, it's my policy never to go out with customers.
I didn't mean I was going to take you out.
- I was going to take you home.
- I have a date.
My home.
Mr. Steele.
You can help me. I've gotta read this book tonight and I'm tired.
- Maybe you could tell it to me.
- Is that what you had in mind?
You make me feel real important.
Just think. When I go to see
Alathea Bruce with Aunt Cora...
...I can say I told the story to the screenwriter. Let me call my date.
Maybe I can still catch him at home.
There's no sacrifice too great for a chance at immortality.
Yes, sir.
My, what a pretty place!
Sort of hacienda- like.
Excuse me.
Neighbor of yours?
No, I never saw her before.
I'll be right with you.
Make yourself at home.
It must be wonderful to be a writer.
Thrilling.
- Make yourself a drink.
- I don't drink.
Before I worked at Paul's, I used to think actors made up their own lines.
When they get to be big stars they usually do.
What? Change your mind?
You asked me here to tell you the story of Alathea Bruce.
Althea.
If that was just a pretence to lure me- -
- You want to go now?
- Well, no. Not unless- -
I changed because I like to be comfortable when I work.
Oh. Well.
I'll have a ginger ale with a twist of lemon. That's known as a horse's neck.
- How do you want me to tell the story?
- Just how you'd tell your Aunt Cora.
Well, it's about this woman,
Alathea Bruce. She's very rich.
She owns this big mansion on Long Island.
She's got sailboats and cars and jewels and everything. And she's a widow.
Lucky Althea.
She's got many men in her life, and they take her to lots of different clubs.
- But they don't send Alathea.
- Althea.
One day she looks out and sees a new lifeguard outside her window...
...and it's very beautifully described.
He looks like a bronzed Apollo.
- I hope it's gonna be in Technicolor.
- I'll suggest that to the producer.
Alathea sends her butler to ask the lifeguard to have breakfast.
But instead, they have whiskey sours.
It's a very risky scene.
- Did I tell you about her husband?
- You told me he was dead.
I mean about the way he died.
He fell out of a boat while sailing, and there's an investigation going on.
Did she kill him?
That's kind of left open.
She falls in love with Channing...
...who's not really a lifeguard but is studying to be a bachelorterologist.
You know, they look into the microbes.
She tells him she didn't do it.
- Who didn't do what?
- Kill Lester!
Lester's her husband, I presume?
- Are you sure you haven't read it?
- No, and I don't think I'm going to.
Go ahead.
Then come the dreamy weeks.
Go on. I can hear you.
They're always together.
She wants him to marry her, but what Channing's after is bacteria.
Bacterogolist.
She throws herself into her lawyer's arms....
All you have to do is follow the book.
- - and that does the trick.
He won't speak to her.
She tries everything, and I do mean everything.
Then she gets desperate.
She wants him so terribly...
...and since there's no other way, one stormy day she swims way out...
...and she starts to scream:
"Help, help, help, help!"
Honey, I have neighbors!
Channing won't swim after her because he thinks it's a trick.
Alathea goes on screaming, and suddenly he realizes she's in danger.
He swims out so fast he hardly even touches the water.
But by the time he gets there, she's gone.
She's joined her husband
Lester in the sea.
- It's a powerful story.
- What you call an epic.
What did I tell you?
There are lots of things
I didn't even mention.
Thank you.
- What time is it?
- It's 12:30.
Oh, is that all?
I'm sorry I acted so stupid. About you taking off your shoes and all.
- It was nice of you to break your date.
- I can see Henry anytime.
Is Henry...? Is he in love with you?
I guess so. He's nice and substantial.
The easy- going type.
He lives with his folks and has a good job.
- So you don't love him.
- Are you a mind reader?
Most writers like to think they are.
Are you going steady with anybody?
You don't have to say. I just wondered.
Look, Mildred, it's late and I'm tired and I have to get up early.
Well, that's all right.
Would you mind if I don't drive you home?
There's a taxi stand right around the corner.
Not at all. That'll be fine.
All right. Here you are and thank you very much.
Well, thank you.
- Good night, Mildred. And thanks a lot.
- Likewise, I'm sure.
- Brub! Hey, what's the idea?
- Hi, Dix.
- Do you know what time it is?
- About 5:00.
Don't cops sleep?
Get out of here.
That an order, major?
You make me homesick for some of the worst years of our lives.
- Have you been drinking?
- No. Have you?
No. No, I've been asleep for hours.
With your clothes on?
What is this?
Hey, where's your uniform?
You in trouble, Brub?
Yeah, they made a mistake and promoted me to detective.
- That's good, I guess.
- It's not a social call, Dix.
I get it. That blabbermouth Junior filed a complaint.
That son- in- law....
Just because I pushed him around.
I'll get you a punching bag for Christmas. Get dressed.
- Capt. Lochner wants to talk to you.
- I'm sorry I didn't really beat him up.
- It's got nothing to do with Junior.
- Then what is it?
My boss will tell you.
- You wanna make yourself coffee?
- No, thanks.
- You know, I got married.
- Why?
She had a couple bucks to spare.
Besides, I like her.
You will too, when you meet her.
Here, you read any good books lately?
- I guess you were asleep, at that.
- Is that a felony in Beverly Hills?
Wouldn't taking a checkroom girl home to hear a story be an odd thing to do?
I'd say it was very practical.
She'd read the book and I hadn't.
If you only wanted a story, why'd you take her to your place?
I work at home.
You had no other reason?
- If so, I didn't do anything about it.
- Did she have a drink at your house?
She had a glass of ginger ale with a twist of lemon in it.
It's known as a horse's neck.
The glass is still on my desk...
...complete with fingerprints.
I was too tired to wash dishes.
You gave her 20 dollars.
Quite a large sum for cab fare.
- Well, she'd given me valuable service.
- Was it two 10s?
Yes, but don't ask me to identify the bills.
Why didn't you call for a cab? Isn't that what a gentleman usually does?
I didn't say I was a gentleman.
I said I was tired.
You're told the girl you were with last night was found murdered...
...dumped from a moving car.
What's your reaction?
Shock, horror, sympathy?
No, just petulance at being questioned...
...a couple of feeble jokes.
You puzzle me, Mr. Steele.
The jokes could have been better, but
I don't see why the rest worries you.
Unless you plan to arrest me for lack of emotion.
- What else did she say about her date?
- No more than I've told you.
- Some more coming.
- Any marks on the neck?
Dr. Jackson said the killer used his arm, not his hands.
How you fellows recording this?
Tape or wire?
Tape.
Here's the mike.
- How long have you known Mr. Steele?
- He was my C.O. Three years overseas.
- See each other much? After the war?
- About a year ago I called him.
He promised to call back.
I'm still waiting.
When I found out he was a cop,
I lost interest.
Send the parking attendant and the other checkroom girl home.
- Wanna see some pictures?
- I don't mind.
It'd help us if it could be established that she left...
...of her own volition and you spent the rest of the night at home.
Did anybody drop in or call you?
No, nobody called.
Poor kid.
Nobody dropped in.
Phone rang once but I didn't answer it.
- You just let it ring?
- I often do. You can ask my neighbors.
Hey, wait a minute....
Miss Gray.
Good morning, Miss Gray.
Please sit down.
I'm Capt. Lochner.
This is Sgt. Nicolai.
- Hello.
- How do you do?
I'm sorry. No more coffee.
Miss Gray, do you know this gentleman?
No.
- Did you ever see him before?
- Yes, a few times.
Where?
The Patio Apartments.
We both live there.
Do you know who he is?
Yes. When I moved in a few days ago,
Mr. Steele was pointed out to me...
...by the manager. She's very proud of having a celebrity tenant.
- Did you see Mr. Steele last night?
- As I came home...
...I saw him go into his apartment with a girl.
That girl was Mildred Atkinson.
She was murdered between
1:00 and 2:00 this morning.
- Murdered?
- Yes. Strangled...
- ...by the vice- like grip of an arm.
- You know. Mugged.
What time did you get home last night?
Shortly after midnight.
Did you see Mr. Steele after he and the girl entered his apartment?
Yes, about a half an hour later.
I saw him at his door saying good night.
- How do you know it was a half- hour?
- It takes me that long...
- ...to get ready for bed.
- Can you see his door from your room?
She was standing on her balcony in a negligee.
It was warm.
My apartment was stuffy.
- Sure he didn't leave with the girl?
- Positive.
- What was he doing?
- He was looking at me.
For never meeting Mr. Steele, you've paid good attention to him.
I have, at that.
- Usually pay attention to neighbors?
- No.
Were you interested because he's a celebrity?
Not at all. I noticed him because he looked interesting.
I like his face.
I guess that will be all for now.
Goodbye, Miss Gray.
Goodbye, Capt. Lochner.
Oh, Barton?
Do attractive young women often admire your face, Mr. Steele?
If they do, they aren't usually as outspoken as Miss Gray. We finished?
Yes, for the time being.
Try to make it later next time.
Good luck. I'll call you, Brub.
No, I'll call you.
I'll see that Miss Gray gets home.
Thank you, but I always go home with the man who brought me.
- I'll drive you back too.
- No, thanks. I'll walk.
I haven't been up this early in years.
How would you feel if you were brought in for questioning at 5:00 a.m.?
Not good.
How would you feel if you were told the girl you took home was murdered?
- I'd come apart at the seams.
- Yes, and people usually do.
Would you say Steele was especially perturbed?
It's hard to tell how Dix feels about anything. We never figured him out.
But he was a good officer and his men liked him.
I like him too. I don't think he killed Mildred Atkinson.
He's hiding something. I doubt if it's the proverbial heart of gold.
- Say, do me a favor, will you, pal?
- Yes, sir?
I want to send two dozen white roses to a girl.
- Yes, sir. Do you want to write a card?
- No, there's no card.
- The name's Mildred Atkinson.
- Yes, sir. What's her address?
I don't know.
Look it up in the papers.
She was murdered last night.
Yes, sir.
I shouldn't have left you last night.
I knew something was going to happen.
- You were in one of those moods.
- Yeah, you look awful.
- There's nothing wrong.
- Nothing wrong?
You should've heard the 7:00 news:
"Checkroom Beauty Murdered...
...Distinguished Screenwriter Takes
Hatcheck Girl Home to Tell Him Story."
- Dix!
- Could have happened to anybody.
But somehow it always happens to you.
What did you tell the police?
- You know a girl named Laurel Gray?
- Dix, what did you tell the police?
Let's make a deal. Look her up in the casting directory...
...I'll tell you what I told the police.
Laurel Gray? Oh, that's the girl that's been going around with Baker.
- She lives across the patio.
- The real estate Baker.
She also likes my face.
She wants a part.
I know a part she'd be good for.
Call Brody and tell him
I didn't read his book.
What for? When he finds out what's happened he'll call it off anyway.
Asking a checkroom girl to tell you the story.
You couldn't have insulted him more.
Tell him it was an excuse for the police.
That's not bad.
Oh, here she is. She's been in a couple low- budget pictures.
Let me see.
That checkroom girl left without you, didn't she? Tell me.
Wonderful face.
Tell me. What happened?
Well, what do you think happened?
Mildred Atkinson's glass.
Don't do things like that!
I don't think...
...I just wanna know that you're in the clear.
Mel, for now, I think I am.
That's what Capt. Lochner said.
Smart fellow.
Couple times he almost had me.
It was his story against mine.
But of course I told my story better.
Notes on Dixon Steele, continued:
"February, 1946:
Beer parlor brawl on Santa Monica Boulevard.
Brought to station for questioning.
Discharged with warning."
Next number:
"March, 1947.
While working as screenwriter, had fistfight with his producer.
Fractured producer's jaw. Fired.
No charges preferred."
I was smart. I covered all the angles.
I have an airtight alibi.
Dix, if you had anything to do with it, tell me!
- Why do you want me to confess?
- I'll have to get you a lawyer...
- ...maybe get you into Mexico.
- Lippman and his connections!
Next number:
"June 22nd, 11 p.m.
Frances Randolph screams for help.
Charges Steele beat her up.
Then denies having made the charge.
Alleges nose broken by running into a door."
He plays rough.
So do I. What else have we got?
Oh, come in.
Mr. Lippman, my agent.
Miss Gray, my alibi.
- Hello.
- Good morning.
- He believes I killed Mildred Atkinson.
- Stop it.
- Want a cup of coffee?
- No, thanks. I came to ask...
...if you could keep my name out of the papers. You have connections?
I don't, but Mel does.
If you want to go to Mexico.
Shut up.
It's easier to get names into papers than to keep them out.
You've kept mine out a few times.
Go ahead, try.
Well, I'll try, but I can't promise anything.
Miss Gray, did you really see him after that girl left?
- Of course I did.
- Sometimes I wish I'd never met you.
But I'm very happy to have met you.
- The best straight man ever.
- You upset him.
When I told him I killed Mildred, he had me across the border.
- Very funny.
- No, it's not very funny.
Good thing you like my face.
I'd be in trouble without you.
I told the police what I saw.
I have no idea what you did after you closed your blinds.
You'd be surprised. I went to bed.
Perhaps I shouldn't have closed my blinds.
You're one up on me.
You can see into my apartment...
- ...but I can't see into yours.
- I promise not to take advantage of it.
If it were the other way around, I'd try to find out who you're hiding from.
Not hiding, avoiding.
It couldn't by any chance be the real estate Mr. Baker?
- Could be.
- Picked up your little marbles, I hope?
We were getting married.
It wouldn't have worked.
You sneaked out the back door, left no address.
That about covers it, only it was my back door.
You know, you're out of your mind.
How could anybody like a face like this?
- Look at it.
- I said I liked it...
...I didn't say I wanted to kiss it.
You're a quitter.
The "get out before you get hurt" type.
- Is that bad?
- You save yourself trouble that way.
I do. I think twice before I get into something.
- You're getting into something now.
- No, I've only thought about it once.
- Are you a fast thinker?
- Not right now.
I didn't get much sleep last night.
A neighbor kept me awake.
Well, sleep.
We'll have dinner tonight.
We'll have dinner tonight, but not together.
When you walked into the police station, I said to myself:
"There she is, the one that's different.
She's not coy, or cute, or corny.
She's a good guy.
I'm glad she's on my side.
She knows what she wants."
Thank you, sir. But let me add...
...I also know what I don't want, and I don't want to be rushed.
When you've made up your mind, stop by. But not before noon.
Thank you, I will.
Your phone's ringing.
Hello?
Hello, Brub.
I can imagine a reunion under better circumstances.
I just talked to Sylvia.
That's my wife.
She wants you to come to dinner tomorrow night.
That's swell. And she said to bring someone, if you like.
Well, maybe I will. But I won't know till tomorrow, along about noon.
Okay.
Good.
Why didn't he dump her
100 feet further up the canyon?
- What difference does it make?
- It'd be L.A.P.D.'s territory, not ours.
We know she was dumped from a moving car.
No clues, motives or suspects.
Present company excepted.
What about Henry?
Who? Kesler?
Well, after she called him and broke a date, he went to bed.
His mother brought him pie, his father heard him snore.
First thing in the morning, he came to the station. He was upset.
Substantial type, eats pie before going to sleep.
You and Lochner don't see enough whodunits.
We solve every murder in less than two hours.
- You know who did it from the start.
- Right.
- You want me to help you?
- I wish somebody would.
You have to have enough imagination to visualize the crime. Here, get up.
Put this chair here.
This one here.
Brub, you sit down there.
Sylvia, you sit there on Brub's right.
You're the killer. You're driving the car. This is the front seat.
What makes you sure this murder was done in a car?
If she was already dead, he'd have put her body in the back.
In that case, he couldn't have dumped her without stopping.
Now, you're driving up the canyon.
Your left hand's on the wheel.
Yeah, go ahead.
She's telling you she'd done nothing wrong.
You put your right arm around her neck.
You get to a lonely place in the road, and you begin to squeeze.
You're an ex- GI. You know judo. You can kill a person without using hands.
You're driving the car, and you're strangling her.
You don't see her bulging eyes or protruding tongue.
Go ahead, Brub, squeeze harder.
You love her, and she's deceived you.
You hate her.
She looks down on you.
She's impressed with celebrities.
She wants to get rid of you. Squeeze.
Harder.
Squeeze harder.
It's wonderful to feel her throat crush under your arm.
- Brub, stop it!
- I didn't hurt you, did I?
No.
Now, are you convinced?
I think so.
Well, I'm not.
You forgot my hands. I could scratch his eyes out before he could kill me.
But you didn't. Your instinct was to try to loosen his grip.
That's where you lost, like Mildred did.
- You've given this a lot of thought.
- I've had a lot of experience in this.
I've killed dozens of people, in pictures.
No, I didn't do it.
I could never throw a lovely body from a moving car.
My artistic temperament wouldn't permit it.
No, naturally.
Creative artists have a respect for cadavers. We treat them with reverence.
Put them in soft beds, lay them on fur rugs, at the foot of a staircase...
...but we could never throw them from a car like cigarette butts.
No. What would Emily Post say?
And having confused you,
I have to go.
Don't go. It's only 10:00.
It's past my bedtime.
Besides, I have a late date.
- May I come again?
- Often.
Thank you.
Give Lochner a report on my theory of the murder.
- Do you think he would want me to?
- I would.
Tell him to look for a man like me without my artistic temperament.
Which may or may not be phony.
I'll walk down with you.
- Next time we'll skip the murder kick.
- Can I depend on it?
Sure. Bring a girl.
Give us another chance.
- Quite an evening.
- Yes.
- What do you think?
- I'm glad you're not a genius.
- He's a sick man, Brub.
- No, he isn't.
- There's something wrong with him.
- He's like that. He's exciting.
I took abnormal psychology- -
When we disagree, you throw that college stuff at me.
I know Dix better than you do.
There's nothing wrong with his mind.
- He's exciting because he isn't normal.
- Cops could use abnormality.
I learned more about the case from him than from investigations- -
I still like the way you are: average!
- Well, thank you kindly!
- You're welcome.
I heard you the first time.
Sit down.
All right, Martha.
I'll see you in the morning. Goodbye.
- You annoy me.
- If I do, it isn't intentional.
- Would you like a drink?
- No, thanks. I don't need one.
- Had too much?
- One martini.
- I knew I was gonna see you.
- Very thoughtful.
Sit down and relax.
- Who's Martha?
- Who?
Oh, Martha.
The only thing left of my movie career.
She's about 50. She's married.
Her son goes to UCLA.
She comes to me twice a week, beats me black and blue, for which I- -
Have you thought about it a second time?
I'm interested.
When did you decide?
Yesterday, about 3 p.m.
I see, just...
...just didn't get around to announcing the official results?
I wanted you to think about it twice too.
I've been looking for someone for a long time. I didn't know her.
I'd never seen her before.
A girl was killed...
...and because of that I found what I was looking for.
Now I know your name, where you live, and how you look.
Snooping through windows.
And in broad daylight too.
- Where are your manners?
- Don't tell Dix.
- He'll think I'm checking on him.
- Come in.
- No. He shouldn't be disturbed.
- Oh, yes he should.
He worked all night.
He hasn't left the house in days.
- Won't take me for a drive.
- Incredible!
He hasn't worked like this since before the war.
- What do you use, witchcraft?
- Only as a last resort.
He's kind of dopey this morning.
I love him that way. I'll show you.
Dixon.
Mel is here to take you to the beauty contest.
I'll be ready in a minute.
He thinks you'll be voted Mr. America.
Good.
Are you really the handsomest man alive?
Yep. Just let me finish this page.
You're a conceited good- for- nothing.
And I don't love you.
- It's your money I'm after.
- Hey, turn off the radio.
- Genius is going to bed.
- Don't! Let me finish this scene.
If he'd met you 10 years ago,
I wouldn't have ulcers today.
What's my first name?
- Hi.
- Say hello to our guest.
Oh, hello, Mel.
What are you doing up?
Can we have coffee?
- No, you're going to bed.
- It's not dark outside.
That's because it's tomorrow. Today.
You haven't slept since yesterday.
If Brody could see, he'd be delighted.
We've got lots of pages for him.
Come on, you're going to bed.
If you don't let me alone,
I'm gonna kick you out.
I'll go back to Chicago and be a Fuller Brush girl.
They were crazy about me in the Near North Side.
You go when I tell you to go.
Remember that.
- I'll try.
- See, he's right.
You can't go.
You couldn't do that to us.
Lower the bridge, open the gates!
Charles Waterman is here!
- It must be Thursday.
- Speaks poetry and borrows money.
- The better to drink brandy.
- Ready to pay homage to an immortal!
Fair princess, most noble princes, I bring greetings from a humble peasant.
Welcome, thespian.
There he goes again.
He can never figure that step out.
- You may arise, thespian.
- Easier said than done.
You've come at the wrong time.
We were putting Dix to bed.
Do me the honor and let me prepare him for repose.
To secure pleasant slumbers,
I shall recite to him.
- Wouldn't you rather have a brandy?
- Most beautiful words in English.
Come, royal boy.
When in disgrace
With fortune and men's eyes
I all alone beweep my outcast state
And trouble deaf heaven
With my bootless cries
And look upon myself and curse my fate
Really, you must stop snooping!
Just a few pages.
I won't say a word.
- He'll show you when it's finished.
- How many pages?
- Many.
- Is he sticking close to the book?
I don't know. I didn't read the book.
Miss Gray, there's a man upstairs to see you.
Thank you, Effie. Don't vacuum.
Mr. Steele's just gone to sleep.
- Well, I gotta vacuum sometime.
- By all the bulls of Bashan!
If anyone else did it, I would shout,
"Ignorant swine!"
I am perplexed. As I said:
"From sullen earth sings hymns at heaven's gate," he began to snore.
There's no hope, no hope at all.
For thy sweet love remembered
Such wealth brings
That then I scorn to change
My state with kings
Then I scorn to change
My state with kings
- Hello. Remember me, Sgt. Nicolai?
- Oh, yes, of course.
- What can I do for you?
- Capt. Lochner wants to talk.
I have nothing to say to him.
I didn't expect you to give me more information...
...but certain facts contradict your original statement.
- I wish you'd say what you mean.
- Yes, let's do that.
On the night of the Atkinson murder, you looked at Dixon Steele...
- ...and said you didn't know him.
- I didn't.
Since then, you and he have been inseparable.
He's writing a script.
I'm typing it.
- Do you receive a salary for this?
- No. I'm doing it for love.
- You're in love with Mr. Steele?
- For the record, I am.
- Are you going to be married?
- If we do, I'll send you an invitation.
After all, you introduced us to each other.
- You're not making my job any easier.
- I don't see how I could.
Why the chip on your shoulder?
Why the defiant attitude? Aren't we on the same side in this matter?
Doesn't it frighten you that there's a killer at large?
He may be in your building.
Certainly in your neighborhood.
Look at these men.
They seem perfectly normal to you?
Yes.
Each one has committed a horrible murder.
Each one is a ruthless maniac.
Mildred Atkinson wasn't killed for any understandable reason.
She had no money, no enemies.
It wasn't a sex murder.
The act of a sick mind with an urge to destroy something young and lovely.
I recognize your position, captain, but you must recognize mine.
I love Dix. It upsets me that you suspect him, even for a second.
Not a second, for three weeks.
He's our most logical suspect.
Why don't you investigate her boyfriend?
We have.
He seems absolutely in the clear.
But look at Mr. Steele's record:
Fights, scandals, destruction.
It all adds up to the same thing: an erratic, violent man.
All this happened years ago.
He's changed.
He has?
Ask Sgt. Nicolai about the other night.
How he dwelled on the murder.
How he made Brub and his wife act it out. Obviously, killing fascinates him.
I don't believe that.
Because you're in love with him.
Thank you for coming.
- Goodbye, captain.
- Goodbye.
Go on, say it. "I told you so."
Where would that get us?
I violated your confidence.
I'm sorry.
It's all right.
You know what you're doing.
- I've got Mr. Kesler.
- Hello, Mr. Kesler.
- How do you do?
- Sorry to inconvenience you.
A few points that aren't quite clear.
Maybe you can help me.
I hope I can.
Please sit down.
- Hi, Kesler.
- Hello, sergeant.
Anything you want to make you happy?
I wouldn't want anyone but you.
What's he doing here?
With or without his wife or tailing me.
Come on, let's get out of here.
Hello, Miss Gray. Hello.
We've warmed up a couple seats for you.
We're going to Paul's.
I want to do everything I can to make your job easier.
I could see why that guy gets into a lot of trouble.
Six hours' sleep. Typing all day.
No wonder your nerves are tied in knots.
You can't be a nursemaid and a sweetheart...
...a cook and a secretary.
You've got to think of yourself.
- I've never been happier in my life.
- Come on, angel. Relax.
Ouch! Martha, you're hurting me!
We should be up on Miller Drive beside that pool Mr. Baker built for you.
He built it to increase property value.
I was waiting for him to raise rent.
He's a good businessman who wants to get married. What's wrong with that?
A girl like you should think about security. And remember...
...in the beginning was the land.
Motion pictures came later.
Okay, turn over.
Dix, is that you?
Yeah. You decent?
No, I'm not. Martha's here.
- Hello, Martha.
- Hello.
- You get the pages I did last night?
- On my table.
I took them from your desk this morning.
- Where have you been?
- None of your business.
I want some orange juice, eggs, bacon, toasted muffin and lots of coffee.
What, no caviar?
You'll get breakfast in 10 minutes.
- We're going to a beach party tonight.
- Good.
With the Nicolais. You met him.
Lochner's office. Remember?
Yes. Vaguely.
You really want to go?
Be back in five minutes.
They still don't know who killed that checkroom girl.
They don't?
- Have you met Frances Randolph?
- No.
I used to take care of her.
All right, tell me. What happened?
What did Mr. Steele do to her?
Nothing much. Just beat her up.
Broke her nose.
Why didn't you warn her? Tell her not to get involved with a brute like Dix?
You can joke about it, angel...
...but someday you'll find out who your friend is. I hope it isn't too late.
This isn't going to be as easy to get out of as it was with Mr. Baker.
That's enough, Martha. Get out!
I'll get out, angel...
...but you'll beg me to come back when you're in trouble.
You will, angel, because you don't have anybody else.
Get out.
I love a picnic.
- Acres of sand, all of it in your food.
- Stop griping. Lie still and inhale.
- What, sand?
- Air. And don't let it go to your head.
He's worked like a fiend all week.
- I've wanted to know how writers work.
- Usually in a sitting position.
- That's wonderful! Not cold at all!
- Oh, my hero!
I meant, does he usually have the story mapped out?
If not, you're in trouble, unless you have my gal friend here as inspiration.
- Are you feeling all right?
- I wouldn't write a page without her.
The only way I can shut her up is to sit down and write.
How I went for her
I don't know.
You know what she says when she reads something?
"Honey, haven't I read this somewheres before?"
Maybe she has.
That's the trouble with
Hollywood dames.
They all have such a sketchy education. They know nothing...
...about the community chest, but everything about community property.
Their arithmetic's not so hot, but just ask them how many minks make a coat.
- How long do you give them, Sylvia?
- Not more than 40 years.
Dix needs you, Laurel.
You ought to marry him.
You have to. You promised Lochner you'd invite him to the wedding.
She promised Lochner what?
Did I say Lochner? I meant Brub.
You're a poor liar, Sylvia.
- When did you see him?
- The other day.
- It was just a routine deal.
- Why didn't you tell me?
- It would only have upset you.
- You're lying to me!
I'm not lying, I just didn't tell you.
I'm sorry.
Still checking on me.
Still trying to pin a murder on me!
I don't know why I said it.
Brub especially asked me not to.
Maybe it's better. I should have told him in the first place. Dix!
Dix!
Dix!
Cigarette?
Watch it, Dix!
You blind, knuckle- headed squirrel!
- Take it easy, son.
- Look at my car!
I just got a new paint job.
200 bucks!
I ought to drag you out of- -
Dix! Stop it!
Stop it! Let him alone!
Dix, don't you- -
Dix, stop! You'll kill him!
I'll take that cigarette now.
Want one?
No.
These guys in hopped- up cars think they own the road.
You weren't angry with him.
You've wanted to fight since you left the beach.
The beach had nothing to do with it.
He asked for it.
- I've had a hundred fights like this.
- Are you proud of it?
No, but I'm usually in the right.
You heard what he called me.
That doesn't justify acting like a madman.
Nobody can call me the things he did.
A blind, knuckle- headed squirrel.
That's real bad.
You drive.
I was born when she kissed me...
...I died when she left me...
...I lived a few weeks while she loved me.
You like it?
What is it?
I want to put it in the script.
I don't know quite where.
The farewell note?
I don't know. Maybe.
Say it back to me.
Let's hear how it sounds.
I was born when she kissed me...
...I died when she left me, I....
I lived a few weeks while she loved me.
- Hi.
- Hello.
300 dollars, payable to John
Mason. Sender, Joe Squirrel.
- You Mr. Squirrel?
- That's right.
- You got a stamped envelope?
- Sure.
Here you are, Mr. Squirrel.
- Sgt. Nicolai?
- Sgt. Nicolai is busy right now.
I'll wait.
Hi, Dix.
Oh, hello, Brub.
- How do you feel this morning?
- About the same as last evening.
What can I do for you?
If you want to find out anything about me, ask me.
I do. But I'm a cop, remember?
I take orders.
Sorry to be late, Sgt. Nicolai.
Noon rush at the bank.
Dixon Steele, Henry Kesler.
- Hello.
- How are you?
They trying to pin this thing on you the same as they are on me?
- If they are, I'm not aware of it.
- You're a much more logical candidate.
You loved her.
You could've been jealous.
If I were Capt. Lochner,
I could get a good case against you.
- Glad to have met you.
- What an imagination.
That's from writing movies.
What a grip.
That's from counting money.
This is what I'd like to have someday.
Small cozy house, near the ocean.
Brub painted the walls.
I made the lampshades and curtains.
They look it too.
Dix wanted me to tell you how bad he feels about last night.
It was my fault.
No. There was no excuse for his behavior.
He's a writer. They can afford to be temperamental.
I'm afraid he'd act just the same no matter what he did.
- You certainly picked a wonderful spot.
- On a clear day we can see Catalina.
He's very much in love with you.
Sylvia, Lochner said that Dix described the murder of Mildred Atkinson. Did he?
We were both very impressed with his imagination. Why should that worry you?
You know he didn't do it.
You saw him after the girl left.
Of course.
He had nothing against her.
- That's what Brub says.
- I know.
Lochner has a different idea.
He believes Dix could've done it.
- I felt like he was trying to warn me.
- Don't pay any attention to Lochner.
You don't realize what he's doing to us.
I suppose it isn't just Lochner.
There's something strange about Dix.
I worry about it. I stay awake nights trying to find out what it is.
Then he shows up with an armload of packages and he's so sweet...
- ...and he makes me feel- -
- Ashamed of what you've been thinking?
Tell him how you feel.
What can I say?
"I love you, but I'm afraid of you."
"I want to marry you, but convince me you didn't kill Mildred Atkinson."
You should go away for a while,
I really think you should.
Give yourself a little time.
Figure things out quietly.
You're too anxious.
Sylvia, after we left you, Dix got into an argument with a man.
He acted like a maniac.
I thought he was going to kill him.
I thought maybe he acted just the same with Mildred.
I came here because I wanted to say these things and be laughed at.
But you're not laughing.
They still don't know who killed that checkroom girl.
This isn't going to be as easy to get out of.
It was the act of a sick mind with an urge to destroy.
An erratic, violent man.
Our most logical suspect.
Killing has a fascination for him.
I wanted to say these things out loud and be laughed at.
But you're not laughing.
Good morning, Mr. Steele.
Going to see Miss Gray?
I'll take those. It'll give me an excuse to see her.
You don't need an excuse, but I need a new pair of legs.
- I'll be back tomorrow with the rest.
- Goodbye, Mr. Swan.
Morning, Effie.
Miss Gray awake?
I've told you.
Don't vacuum when she's sleeping.
She can't hear nothing.
She takes pills.
- Since when?
- I don't know.
She must have worked all night.
I wish you two would get married and go on a honeymoon.
Then I could get these two apartments cleaned up.
Shut it off, honey, and go back to sleep.
I can't. The clock's too far away.
- I'll shut it off for you if you want.
- All right, come in.
Wanna go back to sleep?
No, I'll get up.
I'll start breakfast.
You might open the door for me.
Beg your pardon, Effie.
I'll do it, Dix.
No, I don't want you to.
Sit down, be comfortable.
Room service, coming up.
- What happened to the grapefruit knife?
- It was crooked and I straightened it.
Fool. It's supposed to be curved.
What? Wonder what they'll think of next.
I finished the pages.
Yeah, I noticed you also covered the script.
What are you trying to prove?
You won't get a raise.
I love the love scene.
It's very good.
They're not always telling each other how in love they are.
Good love scenes should be about something beside love. Like this one.
Me fixing grapefruit, you sitting over there dopey, half asleep.
Anyone looking at us could tell we were in love.
Effie wants us to get married.
It'll give her a chance to...
...vacuum the apartment while we're away.
Isn't there a simpler way?
I always knew I'd get stuck with you eventually. All I needed was a push.
Come on, dopey.
Where'd you get the pills?
From my doctor.
When did you see your doctor?
Couple of weeks ago.
Well, why didn't I know about that?
I guess it wasn't important enough to mention.
You haven't always wanted to know things about me.
- You ought to be very flattered I do.
- I am. And I love you.
But there's no reason to rush into anything.
Who said anything about rushing?
I thought if you'd give me an answer, say in the next 10 seconds...
...I'd go out and buy a ring.
Then we could have a party tonight...
...invite a few select friends and enemies...
...fly to Las Vegas and be married by- -
The coffee!
Well, the 10 seconds are up.
- Of course I'll marry you, but- -
- No.
No "of course," no "but," no "why."
Yes or no will do.
A simple yes or no will do very well.
Yes.
Effie, it's okay, you can vacuum tomorrow. Both apartments.
- Dix, wait. What's happened?
- Effie, you tell him.
Well, tell me.
I guess they're gonna get married.
It's me, Mel.
Laurel, I can't tell you how happy I am!
Would you ask Miss- - ?
Martha to call me as soon as she can?
Thank you.
I prayed for this.
It had to come true.
We'll be such a happy family.
I'll come have dinner...
...I'll play with the kids- -
You don't have to worry,
I won't come too often.
I'll only teach the kids nice things.
You're not going to marry him?
No, I'm not. I can't.
I see.
I was hoping for a miracle, and it didn't happen.
I tried, Mel. I wanted it to last so much, for my own sake.
But Dix doesn't act like a normal person.
You don't go around hitting people, smashing cars...
...torturing your best friend.
I'm scared of him.
I don't trust him.
I'm not even sure he didn't kill Mildred Atkinson.
Laurel! You're going too far!
Am I? Have you forgot what you asked me when we first met?
You weren't sure either, and you knew him better than anyone.
Why can't he be like other people?
Why?
Like other people?
Would you have liked him?
You knew he was dynamite.
He has to explode sometimes.
I tried to make him see a psychiatrist.
I thought he'd kill me.
Always violent.
It's as much a part of him as the color of his eyes.
If you want him, you've got to take the bad with the good.
I've taken it for 20 years.
And I'd do it again.
You make me feel ashamed, Mel.
- I should stay with him, but I can't.
- Why did you tell him you'd marry him?
I was scared. I still am!
I hate to see that.
You can't hurt him like this.
Dix has a tremendous ego.
He can't take defeat.
You've got to wait until something good happens.
He wants to take me to Las Vegas tonight.
I've got to get out before he gets back!
If Brody only liked the script, that would help a lot.
If Dix has success, he doesn't need anything else.
Then take the script. It's finished.
And it's wonderful.
It's really wonderful.
Take it to Brody now.
Thank you, Mel. I'll write to you.
Don't. I don't want to know where you are...
...because Dix will ask and I'll have to tell him.
If you feel like writing, write to him.
Then maybe later you'll come back to us.
I hope so.
See you.
Goodbye, Mel.
Yes, this is she.
About your reservation to New York, we may have some space...
...on Flight 22 at 3 p.m. Will you be at this number for another hour?
Yes, I'll be here. Please let me know as quickly as you can.
I got four blocks away and remembered
I don't know your ring size.
- Here. This is about right.
- I want you to choose it.
You have to wear it the rest of your life.
- I still haven't packed.
- Do it later.
We've gotta look at houses...
...and I want to buy you a little car.
Come on.
Why are you always in a hurry?
Are you going to come or do I have to drag you?
- I'm only half dressed.
- That's good enough for me.
Greetings!
Mr. Waterman, you forgot to change your costume.
This is not a costume, ignorant wench.
It is the formal attire of a gentleman.
No applause, please.
Mine host, you've slighted me.
Where's the red carpet...
...the lackeys with candelabra, the trumpeters?
Are we not celebrating a royal engagement?
Of course we are, but it's to be held incognito.
Hi, Charlie.
Forgive the smell of mothballs.
My sincerest congratulations, princess.
Let me embrace you, noble prince.
My senses tell me you've had a few, thespian.
I've been celebrating since your call.
- Brandy for Mr. Waterman.
- What did you do this red- letter day?
So much it's difficult to remember.
First I got a ring, then we looked at houses, then we bought clothes.
- He hasn't left me alone for a second.
- Sounds fascinating, princess.
Let me see the jewel.
Exquisite taste! The princess must not pick the polish from her nails.
The princess has been acting very strangely.
Your table's ready.
Hello, Dix. I understand you're getting married?
That's right. Laurel Gray, this is Frances Randolph.
- Hello, my dear. Congratulations.
- Thank you, Miss Randolph.
Come on, Fran. Join the elite.
You got a wonderful guy, Laurel, and believe me, I should know- -
- Oh, what am I saying?
- That's all right. I've told Laurel...
...you used to pursue me.
Brody wants me for the part of Althea.
I'm going to read the script tonight.
- Whose script?
- Yours, genius.
He's going to send it to my house.
If he likes it.
- Did he say where he got my script?
- I took it to him this morning.
- I stole it out of Laurel's desk.
- I gave it to him.
- Brody's been so impatient.
- I'm sorry, Mel.
- I know Brody will love it.
- It's not you. Mel should know better.
- Is there a juicy part in it for me?
- Did you read it?
- No.
- You're lying! You didn't like it.
What does it matter what I think?
I tried to talk Selznick out of
Gone with the Wind.
- What's wrong with it?
- Nothing. But, it's not the book.
Brody asked for a faithful adaptation.
- The book was trash and you're a thief.
- Dix, please!
- Telephone, Miss Gray.
- Thank you.
She'll take it here.
Never mind. Ask them to call me at home later.
Bring the phone.
I said, bring the phone!
I don't want to talk to anybody.
You don't want to talk in front of me.
Why is it so important
Brody reads it today?
- He's impatient. Has been for weeks.
- But why today?
- Hello, who's this?
- Don't, Dix!
Martha. You calling Miss Gray or are you phoning for Mr. Baker?
That's Laurel's call.
- For heaven's sake!
- I'll see you later.
Are you all right, Miss Gray?
Dixie, my boy, you're in!
And believe me, it's harder to come back than to arrive.
Brody's delighted with the script.
He's raving about it!
Break your glasses?
No. Yes.
Cut your eyes?
No.
Lloyd just got here.
Brody's crazy about the script.
I told you not to pay any attention to me.
Do you want me to look for another agent?
Well, business isn't so hot.
Remind me to get you another tie.
Where's Laurel?
She's gone.
- One moment, please.
- See you, Paul.
All right.
Cancel the Steele dinner.
Hello, Paul's Restaurant.
Paul speaking.
Mr. Dixon Steele?
Just a minute.
He's just left.
Oh, Sgt. Nicolai?
I'll tell him, Sgt. Nicolai. Bye.
He just left the restaurant.
You mind if I read Kesler's confession to him?
Know what?
I'm gonna get drunk tonight.
Don't let a right guess go to your head.
It's been a terrific strain on Laurel and Dix.
They'll never forget Mildred Atkinson.
Or you.
I extracted the bullet from Kesler's left lung...
...that far from the heart.
He's lucky.
- I wonder.
- I wanna try him at home.
Yeah, keep on trying.
Dix?
Let me in.
I'm in bed.
I have an awful headache.
Laurel, let me in, please!
- It's been such a hectic day!
- Let me in!
Don't make me ask you again!
What is it, Dix?
I'm sorry about tonight.
It'll never happen again.
I shouldn't have hit Mel, shouldn't have picked up the telephone....
I don't know why I....
Cigarette?
Where's your ring?
I put it in my jewel box.
You should never take it off your finger. Put it on.
Not now.
- Where is it? I'll get it.
- Dix, can't you relax for a second?
Why is this door locked?
Who's in there?
Nobody. It's a mess.
I didn't want you to see it.
Open it!
- Please, don't order me around.
- Why is it a mess?
Because I've been packing.
We're going away, remember?
Give me that key.
All right, I'll get the ring.
You scared me.
There.
- This all you're taking?
- I just started to pack when you came.
I thought you were in bed.
Were you packing to go on a honeymoon? Or to run away?
Stop it, Dix!
I can't take any more of this!
Hello.
Who?
Oh, I'll give her the message.
You have a cancellation on Flight 16 for New York.
I'll tell her.
There's a cancellation on Flight 16 for New York.
I'll stay with you, Dix.
I promise.
I'll marry you!
I'll go with- -
- You'd run away from me!
- I can't live with a maniac!
I'll never let you go!
Dix, don't! Don't! Please, please!
Don't, Dix! Please don't!
Hello.
Dix, I've been trying to get you everywhere.
I've got some news for you and Laurel.
Just got an airtight confession from Kesler.
Your hunch was right.
He killed her.
Let me talk. I want to apologize to him and Miss Gray.
Is Laurel there? Capt. Lochner wants to apologize to both of you.
Man wants to apologize to you.
Hello?
Miss Gray?
I want you to know how sorry I am
I had to put you through this.
Mr. Steele is absolutely in the clear.
I hope you'll both accept my apologies.
Yesterday this would have meant so much to us.
Now it doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter at all.
I lived a few weeks while you loved me.
Goodbye, Dix.
Men, are you over 40?
When you wake up in the morning, do you feel tired and rundown?
Do you have that listless feeling?
Jefferies.
Congratulations, Jeff.
For what?
For getting rid of that cast.
Who said I was getting rid of it?
This is Wednesday.
Seven weeks from the day you broke your leg. Yes or no?
Gunnison, how did you ever get to be such a big editor with such a small memory?
Thrift, industry and hard work.
And catching the publisher with his secretary.
Did I get the wrong day?
No.
No, wrong week.
Next Wednesday I emerge from this plaster cocoon.
That's too bad, Jeff.
Well, I guess I can't be lucky every day.
Forget I called.
Yeah, I sure feel sorry for you, Gunnison.
Must be rough on you thinking of me wearing this cast for another whole week.
That one week is gonna cost me my best photographer
and you a big assignment.
Where?
There's no point in even talking about it.
Oh, come on, come on. Where?
Kashmir.
Got a code tip from the bureau chief this morning.
The place is about to go up in smoke.
What did I tell you? Didn't I tell you that's the next place to watch?
You did.
Okay. When do I leave?
Half-hour? Hour?
With that cast on? You don't.
Stop sounding stuffy.
I can take pictures from a jeep or a water buffalo, if necessary.
You're too valuable to the magazine for us to play around with.
I'll send Morgan or Lambert.
Morgan or Lambert.
That's fine.
I get myself half-killed for you, and you reward me by stealing my assignments.
I didn't ask you to stand in the middle of that automobile racetrack.
You asked for something dramatically different. You got it.
So did you.
Goodbye, Jeff.
Now wait a minute, Gunnison.
You've got to get me out of here.
Six weeks sitting in a two-room apartment with nothing to do but look out the window at the neighbors.
Bye, Jeff.
No, Gunnison, I...
If you don't pull me out of this swamp of boredom,
I'm gonna do something drastic.
Like what?
"Like what?"
I'm gonna get married.
And then I'll never be able to go anywhere.
It's about time you got married,
before you turn into a lonesome and bitter old man.
Yeah, can't you just see me?
Rushing home to a hot apartment to listen to the automatic laundry and the electric dishwasher and the garbage disposal and the nagging wife.
Jeff, wives don't nag anymore, they discuss.
Is that so?
Is that so?
Well, maybe in the high-rent district they discuss.
In my neighborhood, they still nag.
Yeah? Well, you know best.
I'll call you later, Jeff.
Yeah, have some good news the next time, huh?
Good morning. I said,
"Good morning!"
Oh, good morning.
Say, I wouldn't dig so deep if I were you.
You're giving them far too much water.
Why don't you shut up?
Well!
I do declare.
New York State sentence for a Peeping
Tom is six months in the workhouse.
Oh, hello, Stella.
And they got no windows in the workhouse.
You know, in the old days, they used to put your eyes out with a red-hot poker.
Any of those bikini bombshells you're always watching worth a red-hot poker?
Oh, dear. We've become a race of Peeping Toms.
What people ought to do is get outside their own house and look in for a change.
Yes, sir.
How's that for a bit of homespun philosophy?
Reader's Digest,
April, 1939.
- Well, I only quote from the best.
- Yeah.
You don't have to take my temperature this morning.
Quiet. See if you can break 100.
You know, I should have been a gypsy fortune-teller instead of an insurance-company nurse.
I got a nose for trouble.
Can smell it ten miles away.
You heard of that market crash in '29?
I predicted that.
Just how did you do that, Stella?
Oh, simple.
I was nursing a director of General Motors.
"Kidney ailment," they said.
"Nerves," I said.
Then I asked myself, "What's General
Motors got to be nervous about?"
"Overproduction,"
I says. "Collapse."
When General Motors has to go to the bathroom 10 times a day, the whole country's ready to let go.
You know, Stella, in economics, a kidney ailment has no relationship to the stock market.
None whatsoever.
Crashed, didn't it?
I can smell trouble right here in this apartment.
First you smash your leg, then you get to looking out the window, see things you shouldn't see.
Trouble.
I can see you in court now, surrounded by a bunch of lawyers in double-breasted suits.
You're pleading. You say, "Judge, it was only a little bit of innocent fun.
"I love my neighbors, like a father."
And the judge says,
"Well, congratulations.
"You've just given birth to three years in Dannemora."
Right now I'd welcome trouble, you know.
You've got a hormone deficiency.
How can you tell from a thermometer?
Those bathing beauties you've been watching haven't raised your temperature one degree in a month.
Here we go.
One more week.
No, I think you're right. I think there is gonna be trouble around here.
I knew it.
Ooh!
Do you ever heat that stuff?
Gives your circulation something to fight.
Oh, I see.
What kind of trouble?
Lisa Fremont.
You kidding?
She's a beautiful young girl, and you're a reasonably healthy young man.
She expects me to marry her.
That's normal.
I don't want to.
That's abnormal.
I just... I'm not ready for marriage.
Every man's ready for marriage when the right girl comes along.
And Lisa Fremont is the right girl for any man with half a brain who can get one eye open.
She's all right.
- What'd you do, have a fight?
- No.
Father loading up the shotgun?
What?
Please, Stella.
It's happened before, you know.
Some of the world's happiest marriages have started "under the gun," as you might say.
No, she's just not the girl for me.
Yeah, she's only perfect.
She's too perfect.
She's too talented.
She's too beautiful.
She's too sophisticated.
She's too everything but what I want.
Is what you want something you can discuss?
What? It's very simple, Stella.
She belongs to that rarefied atmosphere of Park Avenue, you know.
Expensive restaurants and literary cocktail parties.
People with sense belong wherever they're put.
Can you imagine her traveling around the world with a camera bum who never has more than a week's salary in the bank?
If she was only ordinary.
You never gonna get married?
I'll probably get married one of these days, but when I do, it's gonna be to someone who thinks of life not just as a new dress and a lobster dinner or latest scandal.
I need a woman who's willing to... Hold it.
Who's willing to go anywhere and do anything and love it.
So the honest thing for me to do is just call the whole thing off.
Let her find somebody else.
Yeah, I can hear you now.
"Get out of my life, you perfectly wonderful woman.
"You're too good for me."
Look, Mr. Jefferies, I'm not an educated woman, but I can tell you one thing.
When a man and a woman see each other and like each other, they ought to come together, wham, like a couple of taxis on Broadway, and not sit around analyzing each other like two specimens in a bottle.
There's an intelligent way to approach marriage.
Intelligence.
Nothing has caused the human race so much trouble as intelligence.
Modern marriage.
No, we've progressed emotionally.
Baloney.
Once it was, "See somebody, get excited, get married."
Now it's, "Read a lot of books, fence with a lot of four-syllable words,
"psychoanalyze each other
"until you can't tell the difference between
"a petting party and a civil service exam."
People have different emotional levels...
When I married Myles, we were both a couple of maladjusted misfits.
We are still maladjusted misfits, and we have loved every minute of it.
Well, that's fine, Stella.
Now, would you fix me a sandwich, please?
Yes, I will.
And I'll spread a little common sense on the bread.
Lisa's loaded to her fingertips with love for you.
I got two words of advice for you.
Marry her.
She pay you much?
Oh!
There.
- Here's the key.
- Thank you.
Well, if you want anything, just ring.
Honey.
Come on.
Got to carry you over the threshold.
Window shopper.
How's your leg?
It hurts a little.
And your stomach?
Empty as a football.
And your love life?
Not too active.
Anything else bothering you?
Mmm-hmm.
Who are you?
Reading from top to bottom, Lisa
Carol
Fremont.
Is this the Lisa Fremont who never wears the same dress twice?
Only because it's expected of her.
It's right off the Paris plane.
Do you think it'll sell?
That depends on the quote, you know. Let's see now.
There's the airplane ticket over and import duties, hidden taxes, profit markup...
A steal at $1,100.
Eleven hundred?
They ought to list that dress on the stock exchange.
Why, we sell a dozen a day in this price range.
Who buys them, tax collectors?
Even if I had to pay, it would be worth it.
Just for the occasion.
Why, is something big going on somewhere?
It's going on right here.
It's a big night.
It's just an old run-of-the-mill Wednesday.
The calendar's full of them.
It's opening night of the last depressing week of L. B. Jefferies in a cast.
Well, I haven't noticed a big demand for tickets or anything.
That's because I bought out the house.
You know, this cigarette box has seen better days.
I picked that up in Shanghai, which has also seen better days.
It's cracked and you never use it.
It's too ornate.
I'm sending up a plain, flat, silver one with just your initials engraved.
That's no way to spend your hard-earned money.
Well, I wanted to.
Oh!
What would you think of starting off with dinner at '21'?
You have, perhaps, an ambulance downstairs?
No, better than that. '21.'
Thank you for waiting, Carl. The kitchen's right there on the left.
Oh, I'll take the wine.
- Good evening, Mr. Jefferies.
- Carl.
Just put everything in the oven, Carl, on low.
- Yes, madam.
- Let's open the wine now.
All right.
It's a
Montrachet.
A great big glassful. There's a corkscrew right over there.
Here, I'll do it.
Big enough?
Yeah, they're fine.
I can't think of anything more boring or tiresome than what you've been through,
- and the last week must be the hardest.
- Let me, sir.
All right.
Yeah, I want to get this thing off and get moving.
Well, I'm going to make this a week you'll never forget.
Fine, thanks.
Just a minute, Carl.
This will take care of the taxi as well.
Thank you,
Miss Fremont.
Have a pleasant dinner,
Mr. Jefferies.
All right.
Good night.
Good night.
What a day
I've had.
Are you tired?
Not a bit.
I was all morning in a sales meeting, then I had to dash to the Waldorf for a quick drink with Madame Dufresne, who's just over from Paris with some spy reports.
And then I had to go to '21 ' and have lunch with the Harper's Bazaar people.
And that's when
I ordered dinner.
Then I had two fall showings 20 blocks apart.
Then I had to have a cocktail with Leland and Slim Hayward.
We're trying to get his new show.
And then I had to dash back and change.
Well, now, tell me. Tell me. Now, what was Mrs. Hayward wearing?
- Oh, she looked wonderfully cool.
- She did.
She had on the most divine Italian hand-print
- mousseline de soie...
- Oh, Italian?
- Oh, you.
- Italian. Imagine.
To think I planted three nice items in the columns about you today.
You did?
You can't buy that kind of publicity.
I know.
Someday you may want to open up a studio of your own here.
How would I run it from, say, Pakistan?
Jeff...
Isn't it time you came home? You could pick your assignment.
I wish there was one I wanted.
Make the one you want.
- You mean leave the magazine?
- Yes.
For what?
For yourself and me.
I could get you a dozen assignments tomorrow.
Don't laugh.
I could do it.
That's what
I'm afraid of.
Can you see me driving down to the fashion salon in a jeep, wearing combat boots and a three-day beard?
Wouldn't that make a hit?
I could see you looking very handsome and successful in a dark blue flannel suit.
Let's stop talking nonsense, shall we?
Hmm?
Guess I'd better start setting up for dinner.
To see you is to love you
And I see you everywhere
In the sunrise
In the moon glow
Any place I look you're there
To see you is to want you
And I see you all the time
On a sidewalk
In a doorway
On the lonely stairs I climb
Someday let me show you
How happy endings start
You'll find how well
I know you
'Cause to know you at all
Is to know you by heart
To see you is to love you
And you're never out of sight
And I love you and I'll see you
In the same old dream
Tonight
Miss Lonelyheart.
At least that's something you'll never have to worry about.
Oh?
You can see my apartment from here, all the way up on 63rd Street?
No, not exactly, but we have a little apartment here that's probably about as popular as yours.
You remember, of course, Miss
Torso, the ballet dancer?
She's like a queen bee with her pick of the drones.
I'd say she's doing a woman's hardest job. Juggling wolves.
Thank you.
Well, she picked the most prosperous-looking one.
She's not in love with him or any of them.
Oh, how can you tell that from here?
You said it resembled my apartment, didn't you?
I hope they're cooked this time.
Where's that wonderful music coming from?
Some songwriter over there in the studio apartment.
Wow!
He lives alone. Probably had a very unhappy marriage.
Oh, it's enchanting.
It's almost as if it were being written especially for us.
Hmm.
No wonder he's having so much trouble with it.
At least you can't say the dinner isn't right.
Lisa, it's perfect.
As always.
There can't be that much difference between people and the way they live.
We all eat, talk, drink, laugh, wear clothes.
Well, now look...
If you're saying all this because you don't want to tell me the truth, because you're hiding something from me, then maybe I can understand.
I'm not hiding anything.
It's just that...
It doesn't make sense.
What's so different about it here from over there or anyplace you go that one person couldn't live in both places just as easily?
Some people can. Now, if you'll just let me...
What is it but traveling from one place to another, taking pictures?
It's just like being a tourist on an endless vacation.
Okay. Now that's your opinion.
You're entitled to it. Now, let me give you my side.
It's ridiculous to say that it can only be done by a special, private little group of anointed people.
I made a simple statement, a true statement, but I can back it up if you'd just shut up for a minute.
If your opinion is as rude as your manner, I don't think I care to hear it.
Oh, come on now.
Simmer down.
I can't fit in here.
You can't fit in there.
I mean, according to you, people should be born, live and die on the same spot!
Shut up!
Did you ever eat fish heads and rice?
Of course not.
Well, you might have to if you went with me.
Did you ever try to keep warm in a C-54 at 15,000 feet, 20 degrees below zero?
Oh, I do it all the time. Whenever
I have a few minutes after lunch.
Did you ever get shot at?
Did you ever get run over?
Did you ever get sandbagged at night because somebody got unfavorable publicity from your camera?
Did you ever... Those high heels, they'll be great in the jungle.
And the nylons and those six-ounce lingerie.
- Three.
- All right, three.
They'll make a big hit in Finland, just before you freeze to death.
Well, if there's one thing I know, it's how to wear the proper clothes.
Yeah, yeah.
Well, try and find a raincoat in
Brazil, even when it isn't raining.
Lisa, in this job you carry one suitcase.
Your home is the available transportation.
You don't sleep very much. You bathe less.
And sometimes the food that you eat is made from things that you couldn't even look at when they're alive.
Jeff, you don't have to be deliberately repulsive just to impress me I'm wrong.
Deliberately repulsive? I'm just trying to make it sound good.
You just have to face it, Lisa, you're not meant for that kind of a life.
Few people are.
You're too stubborn to argue with.
I'm not stubborn.
I'm just truthful.
I know, a lesser man would have told me it was one long holiday, and I would have been awakened to a rude disillusionment.
Oh, well now, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
If you want to get vicious on this thing,
I'd be very happy to accommodate you.
No, I don't particularly want that.
So that's it?
You won't stay here, and I can't go with you.
It would be the wrong thing.
You don't think either one of us could ever change?
Right now it doesn't seem so.
I'm in love with you. I don't care what you do for a living.
I'd just like to be part of it somehow.
It's deflating to find out the only way I can be part of it is to take out a subscription to your magazine.
I guess I'm not the girl I thought I was.
There's nothing wrong with you, Lisa.
You've got this town in the palm of your hand.
Not quite, it seems.
Goodbye, Jeff.
You mean good night.
I mean what I said.
Well, Lisa, couldn't we just...
Uh...
Couldn't we just keep things status quo?
Without any future?
When am I gonna see you again?
Not for a long time.
At least not until tomorrow night.
Don't!
Hey! Rain.
Grab that. The rest of the blanket.
Wait, I'll get the clock.
Oh, no!
Put it in, now.
Pull on it.
Let me do it.
In you go.
No, you can't come in.
It's much too late.
No, no, not now. Get your foot out of the way. No, I said good night.
What's that supposed to be, ma'am?
It's called
"Hunger."
You'd think the rain would have cooled things off.
All it did was make the heat wet.
That's it.
That's it.
That's stiff one, right there.
Right there.
You know, the insurance company would be much happier if you'd sleep in bed at night instead of in that wheelchair.
How'd you know?
Eyes are all bloodshot.
Must have been watching out that window for hours.
Yeah, I was.
What are you gonna do if one of them catches you?
It depends which one.
Miss Torso, for example...
You keep your mind off her.
She sure is the "Eat, drink and be merry" girl.
Yeah, she'll wind up fat, alcoholic and miserable.
Yeah.
Speaking of misery, poor Miss Lonelyheart.
She drank herself to sleep again, alone.
Poor soul.
Oh, well.
Maybe one day she'll find her happiness.
Yeah, and some man will lose his.
Isn't there anybody in the neighborhood who could cast an eye in her direction?
I don't know.
It just might be that the salesman will be available soon.
Oh, him and his wife splitting up?
I just can't figure it.
He went out several times last night in the rain, carrying his sample case.
Well, he's a salesman, isn't he?
What would he be selling at 3:00 in the morning?
Flashlights.
Luminous dials for watches.
House numbers that light up.
I don't think so.
I don't think so.
I think he was taking something out of the apartment.
Uh-huh.
His personal effects.
He's gonna run out on her, the coward.
Yeah.
Sometimes it's worse to stay than it is to run.
Yeah, well, it takes a particularly low type of man to do a thing like that.
How about this morning?
Any further developments?
The shades are all drawn in the apartment.
- In this heat?
- Yeah.
Well, they're up now.
Get back!
Get back!
Where do you want me to go?
Come on, get out of sight.
Get out of sight.
What is it?
What's the matter?
That salesman's looking out of his window. You see?
Get back!
He'll see you.
I'm not shy. I've been looked at before.
That's no ordinary look.
That's the kind of look a man gives when he's afraid somebody might be watching him.
Get away from there. Get away from there.
He'll be after you.
Go on, into the house.
Into the house.
Goodbye, Mr. Jefferies.
See you tomorrow.
Uh-huh.
And don't sleep in that chair again.
Uh-huh.
"Uh-huh.
Uh-huh."
Great conversationalist.
Stella.
Take those binoculars out of the case and bring them here, will you?
Trouble.
I can smell it.
I'll be glad when they crack that cast, and I can get out of here.
Uh-huh.
How far does a girl have to go before you'll notice her?
Well, if she's pretty enough, she doesn't have to go anywhere.
She just has to "be."
Well, ain't I?
Pay attention to me.
I'm not exactly on the other side of the room.
Your mind is...
And when I want a man,
I want all of him.
Don't you ever have any problems?
I have one now.
So do I.
Tell me about it.
Why...
Why would a man leave his apartment three times on a rainy night with a suitcase, and come back three times?
He likes the way his wife welcomes him home.
No, no. No, no.
No, no. Not this salesman's wife.
And why didn't he go to work today?
Homework. It's more interesting.
What's interesting about a butcher knife and a small saw wrapped in newspaper?
Hmm?
Nothing, thank heaven.
Why hasn't he been in his wife's bedroom all day?
I wouldn't dare answer that.
Well, listen. I'll answer it, Lisa.
There's something terribly wrong.
And I'm afraid it's with me.
What do you think?
Something too frightful to utter.
He went out a few minutes ago in his undershirt, hasn't come back yet.
That'd be a terrible job to tackle.
Just how would you start to cut up a human body?
Jeff, I'll be honest with you. You're beginning to scare me a little.
Jeff, did you hear what I said?
You're beginning to scare...
Shh! Shh!
He's coming back!
Jeff, if you could only see yourself!
What's the matter?
Sitting around looking out of the window to kill time is one thing, but doing it the way you are, with binoculars and wild opinions about every little thing you see, is diseased!
What, do you think I consider it recreation?
I don't know what you consider it, but if you don't stop it,
I'm getting out of here.
What's the...
What is it you're looking for?
I just want to find out what's the matter with the salesman's wife, that's all.
Does that make me sound like a madman?
What makes you think there's something the matter with her?
A lot of things. She's an invalid.
She demands constant care.
Yet neither the husband or anybody else has been in to see her all day. Why?
Maybe she died.
Where's the doctor?
Where's the undertaker?
She could be sleeping, under sedatives.
He's in there now.
There's nothing to see.
There is something... I've seen it through that window.
I've seen bickering and family quarrels and mysterious trips at night and knives and saws and ropes.
And now, since last evening, not a sign of the wife.
All right. Now you tell me where she is.
- I don't know.
- What's she doing? Where is she?
Maybe he's leaving his wife. I don't know.
I don't care!
Lots of people have knives and saws and ropes around their houses.
And lots of men don't speak to their wives all day.
Lots of wives nag and men hate them and trouble starts, but very, very few of them end up in murder, if that's what you're thinking.
It's pretty hard for you to keep away from that word, isn't it?
- You could see all that he did, couldn't you? - Of course...
You could see because the shades were up and he walked along the corridor and the street and the backyard.
I've seen him in the backyard, fixing the flowers...
Oh, Jeff, do you think a murderer would let you see all that?
That he wouldn't pull the shades down and hide behind them?
Just where he's being clever.
He's being nonchalant about it.
And that's where you're not being clever.
A murderer would never parade his crime in front of an open window.
Why not?
Why, for all you know, there's probably something a lot more sinister going on behind those windows.
Where?
Oh!
No comment.
Let's start from the beginning again, Jeff.
Tell me everything you saw and what you think it means.
Yeah?
The name on the second floor
rear mail box reads,
"Mr. and Mrs. Lars."
That's L-A-R-S.
Lars Thorwald.
What's the number of the apartment house?
125 West
9th Street.
Thank you, dear.
Okay, chief. What's my next assignment?
Just go home.
All right, but what's he doing now?
He's just sitting in the living room in the dark.
Hasn't gone near the bedroom.
Now you go home and get some sleep.
- Good night.
- Good night.
All right.
What's it all about, Jeff?
Now look, Doyle, it's just something
I can't tell you over the telephone.
You have to be here and see the whole setup.
Important, huh?
Well, it's probably nothing important at all.
It's just a little neighborhood murder, that's all.
Did you say
"murder," Jeff?
Yes, as a matter of fact,
I did say "murder."
Oh, come now.
My only thought was throwing a little business your way, that's all.
I figured a good detective would jump at the chance of something to detect.
- I'm not working.
- What?
This happens to be my day off.
Well, I usually took my best pictures on my day off.
I'll drop by.
Okay, Doyle. All right.
As soon as you can.
Bless your heart, Stella.
Gee whiz, look at this.
I can't tell you what a welcome sight this is.
No wonder your husband still loves you.
- The police.
- What?
You called the police.
Well, not exactly.
Not an official call. It's just an old friend of mine.
An old, ornery friend of mine.
Just where do you suppose he cut her up?
Of course.
The bathtub.
That's the only place where he could have washed away the blood.
He better get that trunk out of there before it starts to leak.
Harry?
Look, look,
Mr. Jefferies.
I thought Doyle would be here by the time the trunk left, or I'd have called the police.
Now we're gonna lose it.
- Hold everything.
- Don't do anything foolish.
I'm just gonna get the name off that freight truck.
I'll keep an eye on the alley.
Long distance.
You didn't see the killing or the body.
How do you know there was a murder?
Because everything this fellow's done has been suspicious.
Trips at night in the rain, and knives and saws and trunks with rope and now this wife that isn't there anymore.
I admit it all has a mysterious sound.
It could be any number of things.
Murder's the least plausible.
Doyle, don't tell me he's an unemployed magician, amusing the neighborhood with his sleight of hand. Don't tell me that.
It's too obvious and stupid a way to commit murder.
In full view of 50 windows?
Then sit over there smoking a cigar, waiting for the police to come and pick him up?
All right, Officer, do your duty.
Go over and pick him up.
Jeff, you've got a lot to learn about homicide.
Why, morons have committed murder so shrewdly, it's taken a hundred trained police minds to catch them.
That salesman wouldn't just knock his wife off after dinner and toss her in the trunk and put her in storage.
I'll bet it's been done.
Most everything's been done, under panic.
This is a thousand-to-one shot.
He's still sitting around the apartment.
That man's not panicked.
You think I made all this up?
Well, I think you saw something.
There's probably a very simple explanation for that.
For instance?
Wife took a trip.
His wife was sick in bed.
Yeah, so you told me.
Well, Jeff, I've got to run along.
I won't report this to the department.
Let me poke into it a little on my own.
No sense in your getting a lot of ridiculous publicity.
Thank you.
We know the wife is gone, so I'll see if I can find out where.
Do that.
You had any headaches lately?
Not until you showed up.
It'll wear off, along with the hallucinations.
See you around.
Get along.
He has a six months' lease.
Used up a little more than five and a half months of it.
He's quiet, drinks, but not to drunkenness.
Pays his bills promptly with money earned as a costume jewelry salesman.
Wholesale.
Kept to himself. None of his neighbors got close to him or his wife.
Yeah, well, I think they missed their chance with her.
She never left the apartment...
- Where is she? The icebox?
- ...until yesterday morning.
- What time?
- 6:00 a.m.
6:00 a.m.
I think that's about the time I fell asleep.
Too bad.
Thorwalds were leaving their apartment at just that time.
Feel a little foolish?
No, not yet.
How's your wife?
Oh, she's fine.
Who said they left then?
Who left where?
The Thorwalds, at 6:00 in the morning.
Oh, the building superintendent and two tenants.
Flat statements, no hesitation.
They jived with the letter.
Thorwalds were on their way to the railroad station.
Well, now, Tom, how could anybody possibly guess that?
What, did they have signs on their luggage, saying, "Grand Central or bust?"
The superintendent met
Thorwald on his way back.
Thorwald told him that he'd put his wife on a train to the country.
I see. I'd say this is a pretty convenient guy, this superintendent.
Have you checked his bank statements lately?
Huh?
Well, what good's his information?
It's a secondhand version of an unsupported story by the murderer himself, Thorwald.
Now did anybody actually see the wife get on the train?
I hate to remind you, but this all started because you said she was murdered.
Now, did anyone, including you, actually see her murdered?
What are you doing?
Are you interested in solving this case or in making me look foolish?
Well, if possible, both.
Well, then, do a good job of it.
Go over there and search
Thorwald's apartment.
It must be knee-deep in evidence.
I can't do that.
Well, no, I don't mean right now, but when he goes out for a drink, or a paper, or something. What he doesn't know won't hurt him.
I can't do that, even if he isn't there.
What's he... Does he have a courtesy card from the police department, or something?
Now don't get me mad.
Not even a detective can walk into an apartment and search it.
If I were caught in there, they'd have my badge within 10 minutes.
All right. Make sure you don't get caught, that's all.
What? If you find something, you've got a murderer, and they don't care anything about a couple of house rules.
If you don't find anything, the fellow's clear.
At the risk of sounding stuffy, I'd like to remind you of the Constitution and the phrase, "Search warrant issued by a judge
"who knows his Bill of Rights verbatim."
He must ask for evidence.
Give him evidence.
Yeah, I can hear myself.
"Your Honor, I have a friend who's an amateur sleuth.
"Well, the other night after having a heavy dinner, he..."
He'd throw the New York State penal code right in my face.
And there's six volumes.
You know, by tomorrow morning there may not be any evidence left over in that apartment.
You know that.
It's a detective's nightmare.
What do you need before you can search?
Tell me. Now, what do you need?
Bloody footsteps leading up to the door?
One thing I don't need is heckling.
You called me and asked for help.
Now you're behaving like a taxpayer.
How did we ever stand each other in that plane for three years during the war?
I guess I'll go over to the railroad station and check on Thorwald's story.
Oh, forget about the story.
Find the trunk.
Mrs. Thorwald's in it.
Oh, I almost forgot.
There was a postcard in
Thorwald's mailbox. It was mailed 3:30 yesterday afternoon from Merritsville.
That's 80 miles north of here.
Message went, "Arrived okay.
Already feeling better.
"Love, Anna."
Oh...
Is that...
Anna... Is that who I think it is?
Mrs. Thorwald.
Oh, so anything you need, Jeff?
You might send me a good detective.
Many dreams ago
I dreamed many dreams
Waiting for my true love
To appear
Though each night it seems
Someone filled my dreams
Still the face
That I kissed wasn't clear
So I let my heart dance
To many sweet refrains
But now just one song
And just one dream remains
That one song is you
And at last I know
You're the one I dreamed of
Many dreams ago
- Hello?
- Hello, Miss Doyle?
Yes?
This is Jeff again.
Has Tom come in yet?
Not yet, Jeff.
You mean you haven't even heard from him?
Not a word. Is it something really important, Jeff?
Yeah, I'm afraid it is, Tess.
I'll have him call the moment I hear from him.
No, no, don't bother to do that.
Just have him get over here as soon as he can.
Looks like Thorwald's pulling out tonight.
Who's Thorwald?
He'll know, he'll know.
And Thorwald's a man,
Tess, don't worry.
- Good night, you idiot.
- Good night.
Long distance again.
There's somebody at the door.
- Hi.
- Hello.
Hello.
What'd you do to your hair?
- Oh, well, I just sort of...
- Take a look at Thorwald.
He's getting ready to pull out for good.
Look at him.
He doesn't seem to be in any hurry.
He's been laying out all his things on one of the beds.
Shirts, suits, coats, socks.
Even his wife's...
That alligator handbag
- his wife had on the bedpost.
- What about it?
He had it hidden in the dresser.
At least, it was there.
He took it out, went to the telephone and made a long-distance call.
He had his wife's jewelry in the handbag.
Seemed worried about it.
Asked somebody's advice over the telephone.
Someone not his wife.
Well, I never saw him ask her for advice.
She volunteered plenty, but I never saw him ask her for any.
I wonder where he's going.
I don't know.
Suppose he doesn't come back again?
He'll be back. His things are still there.
Well, I guess it's safe to put on some lights now.
No, not yet!
Okay, you can turn it on now. He must have gone someplace to the right.
All day long, I've been trying to keep my mind on my work.
Thinking about Thorwald?
And you and your friend, Doyle.
Did you hear from him again, since he left?
Not a word.
He said he was gonna check the railroad station and the trunk.
He must be still at it.
Something on your mind?
It doesn't make sense to me.
What doesn't?
Women aren't that unpredictable.
Mmm.
Well, I can't guess what you're thinking.
A woman has a favorite handbag and it always hangs on her bedpost, where she can get at it easily.
And then, all of a sudden, she goes away on a trip and leaves it behind. Why?
Because she didn't know she was going on a trip.
And where she's going, she wouldn't need the handbag.
Yes, but only her husband would know that.
And that jewelry.
Women don't keep their jewelry in a purse getting all twisted and scratched and tangled up.
Well, do they hide it in their husband's clothes?
They do not.
And they don't leave it behind, either.
Why, a woman going anywhere but the hospital would always take makeup, perfume and jewelry.
Put that over there.
That's inside stuff, huh?
It's basic equipment.
And you don't leave it behind in your husband's drawer in your favorite handbag.
Well, I'm with you, sweetie. I'm with you.
Tom Doyle has a pat answer for that, though.
That Mrs. Thorwald left at 6:00 a.m. yesterday with her husband?
According to those witnesses.
Well, I have a pat rebuttal for Mr. Doyle.
That couldn't have been
Mrs. Thorwald, or I don't know women.
What about the witnesses?
We'll agree they saw a woman, but she was not
Mrs. Thorwald.
That is, not yet.
Is that so?
Come here.
I'd like to see your friend's face when we tell him.
He doesn't sound like much of a detective.
Oh, don't be too hard on him.
He's a steady worker.
I sure wish he'd show up.
Don't rush him.
We have all night.
- We have all what?
- Night.
I'm going to stay with you.
Well, you'll have to clear that with my landlord.
I have the whole weekend off.
That's very nice, but
I just have one bed.
If you say anything else, I'll stay tomorrow night, too.
I won't be able to give you any pajamas.
You said I'll have to live out of one suitcase.
I'll bet yours isn't this small.
This is a suitcase?
Well, a Mark Cross overnight case, anyway.
Compact, but ample enough.
Looks like you packed in a hurry.
Look at this.
Isn't that amazing?
I'll trade you...
My feminine intuition for a bed for the night.
I'll go along with that.
There's that song again.
Where does a man get inspiration to write a song like that?
Well, he gets it from the landlady once a month.
It's utterly beautiful.
I wish I could be creative.
Oh, sweetie, you are.
You have a great talent for creating difficult situations.
- I do?
- Sure.
Like staying here all night uninvited.
Surprise is the most important element of attack.
And besides, you're not up on your private eye literature.
When they're in trouble, it's always their Girl Friday who gets them out of it.
Is she the girl that saves them from the clutches of the seductive showgirls and the over-passionate daughters of the rich?
- The same.
- That's the one, huh?
It's funny. He never ends up marrying her, does he?
That's strange.
Weird.
Why don't I slip into something more comfortable?
By all means.
I mean, like the kitchen and make us some coffee.
Oh, and some brandy, too, huh?
Harry.
- Jeff.
- Hi.
What else have you got on this man Thorwald?
Well, enough to scare me you wouldn't show up in time and we'd lose him.
Think he's getting out of here?
Look, he's got everything he owns laid out over there in the bedroom, waiting to be packed.
I'm just warming some brandy.
Mr. Doyle, I presume?
Tom, this is
Miss Lisa Fremont.
How do you do?
We think Thorwald's guilty.
Careful, Tom.
- Hello.
- Lieutenant Doyle.
Yeah, he's right here.
For you.
- Hello.
- Lieutenant Doyle, sir?
Speaking.
Yeah.
All right.
I see. Thank you. Goodbye.
Coffee will be ready soon.
Jeff, aren't you going to tell him about the jewelry?
Jewelry?
He's got his wife's jewelry hidden in his clothes in the bedroom over there.
You sure it belonged to his wife?
It was in her favorite handbag.
Mr. Doyle, that can only lead to one conclusion.
Namely?
That it was not Mrs. Thorwald that left with him yesterday morning.
You figured that out, eh?
Well, it's simply that women don't leave their jewelry behind when they go on a trip.
Come on, come on, Tom.
Now you don't really need any of this information, do you?
As a matter of fact, I don't.
Lars Thorwald is no more a murderer than I am.
You mean to say you can explain everything that's gone on over there, and is still going on?
No, neither can you.
That's a secret, private world you're looking into out there.
People do a lot of things in private they couldn't possibly explain in public.
Like disposing of their wives?
You get that idea out of your mind.
It'll only lead in the wrong direction.
What about the knife and the saw?
Did you ever own a saw?
Well, at home in the garage I had...
How many people did you cut up with it?
Or with the couple of hundred knives you've probably owned in your lifetime?
Well, your logic is backward.
You can't ignore the wife disappearing and the trunk and the jewelry.
I checked the railroad station.
He bought a ticket.
Ten minutes later, he put his wife on a train.
Destination, Merritsville.
The witnesses are that deep.
That might have been a woman, but it couldn't have been Mrs. Thorwald.
- That jewelry...
- Look, Miss Fremont.
That feminine intuition stuff sells magazines.
But in real life, it's still a fairy tale.
I don't know how many wasted years I've spent tracking down leads based on female intuition.
All right. I take it you didn't find the trunk, and all this is from an old speech you once made at the Policemen's Ball.
I found the trunk a half-hour after I left here.
I suppose it's normal for a man to tie up a trunk with heavy rope?
Well, if the lock is broken, yes.
And what did you find inside the trunk?
A surly note to me?
Mrs. Thorwald's clothes.
Clean, well packed.
Not stylish, but presentable.
Didn't you take them off to the crime lab?
I sent them on their merry and legal way.
Why, when a woman is taking a simple, short trip, does she take everything she owns?
Let's let the female psychology department handle that one.
I would say it looked as if she wasn't coming back.
That's what's known as a family problem.
And if she wasn't coming back, why didn't he tell his landlord?
I'll tell you why he didn't tell his landlord.
Because he was hiding something.
Do you tell your landlord everything?
I told you to be careful, Tom.
Look, if I'd have been careful piloting that reconnaissance plane during the war, you wouldn't have had the chance to take the pictures that won you a medal, and a good job, and fame and money.
What do you say we all sit down and have a nice, friendly drink, too? Hmm?
Forget all about this.
We can tell lies about the good old days during the war.
You mean you're through with the case?
There is no case to be through with, Miss Fremont.
How about that drink?
Yeah, I guess you're right.
Well, I think I better get home and get some sleep.
Cheers.
Not much of a snifter.
Oh, Jeff, if you need any more help...
Consult the Yellow Pages in your telephone directory.
Oh, I love funny exiting lines.
Who was that trunk addressed to?
Mrs. Anna Thorwald.
Well, then let's wait and find out who picks it up.
Oh, that telephone call.
I gave them your number.
I hope you don't mind.
Depends on who they were.
The police at
Merritsville.
They reported the trunk was just picked up by Mrs. Anna Thorwald.
Don't stay up too late.
- Look.
- What?
Yeah, he's kind of young, isn't he?
What are you doing?
You know, much as I hate to give Thomas J.
Doyle too much credit, he might have gotten a hold of something when he said that was pretty private stuff going on out there.
I wonder if it's ethical to watch a man with binoculars and a long-focus lens.
Do you... Do you suppose it's ethical, even if you prove that he didn't commit a crime?
I'm not much on rear-window ethics.
Of course, they can do the same thing to me.
Watch me like a bug under a glass, if they want to.
Jeff, you know, if someone came in here, they wouldn't believe what they'd see.
What?
You and me with long faces.
Plunged into despair because we find out a man didn't kill his wife.
We're two of the most frightening ghouls I've ever known.
You'd think we could be a little bit happy that the poor woman is alive and well.
Whatever happened to that old saying, "Love thy neighbor"?
You know, I think I'll start reviving that tomorrow.
Yeah, I'll begin with Miss Torso.
Not if I have to move into an apartment across the way and do the Dance of the
Seven Veils every hour.
Show's over for tonight.
Preview of coming attractions.
Did Mr. Doyle think
I stole this case?
No, Lisa, I don't think he did.
What do you think?
Well...
I will rephrase the question.
Thank you.
Do you like it?
Yes, I like it.
Well...
What's the matter?
- Somebody's hurt?
- It's the dog.
Something's happened to the dog.
What's the trouble?
Somebody fall out a window?
See, it's a dog down there.
It's dead.
It's been strangled.
The neck is broken.
Which one of you did it?
Which one of you killed my dog?
You don't know the meaning of the word "Neighbors."
Neighbors like each other, speak to each other, care if anybody lives or dies.
But none of you do!
But I couldn't imagine any of you being so low that you'd kill a little helpless, friendly dog.
The only thing in this whole neighborhood who liked anybody.
Did you kill him because he liked you?
Just because he liked you?
Let's go inside.
Come on. Let's go back in.
It's only a dog.
You know, for a minute, that Tom Doyle almost had me convinced I was wrong.
- But you're not?
- Look.
In the whole courtyard, only one person didn't come to the window.
Look.
Why would Thorwald want to kill a little dog?
Because it knew too much?
You think this is worth waiting all day to see?
Is he cleaning house?
He's washing down the bathroom walls.
Hmm.
Must have splattered a lot.
Well, why not? That's what we're all thinking.
He killed her in there, he has to clean up those stains before he leaves.
Oh, Stella, your choice of words.
Nobody ever invented a polite word for a killing yet.
Lisa? Lisa, back there, on that shelf, there's a little yellow box. You see it?
- Top one?
- Right on top, yeah.
Bring it. And bring me the viewer there.
I just got a...
Now, these are about two weeks old.
I hope I took something else besides leg art. Now which one...
- What are you looking for?
- Here.
There's something, and if I'm right,
I think I've solved a murder.
- Mrs. Thorwald?
- No.
No, the dog.
Uh-huh.
I think I know why
Thorwald killed that dog.
Here, now you take a look.
Tell me what you see.
Now take it down.
Now look again. Now take it down.
You see?
But it's just a picture of the backyard, that's all.
One important change.
One important change.
Those flowers in
Thorwald's pet flower bed.
You mean where the dog was sniffing around?
Where the dog was digging.
Now look at those flowers.
Look, right? Those two yellow zinnias on this end aren't as tall as they were.
Now, since when do flowers grow shorter in two weeks?
There's something buried there.
Mrs. Thorwald.
You haven't spent much time around cemeteries, have you?
Mr. Thorwald could scarcely put his wife's body in a plot of ground about one foot square.
Unless, of course, he put her in standing on end, and then he wouldn't need a knife and saw.
No, my idea is she's scattered all over town.
- Leg in the East River...
- Oh, Stella, please!
No, no, no. There's something in there.
Those flowers have been taken out and put back in.
- Maybe it's the knife and saw.
- Yeah.
Call Lieutenant Doyle.
No, let's wait.
Let's wait till it gets a little darker, and I'll go over there and dig them up.
You'll go? You won't dig anything up and get your neck broken.
No, no, we've...
We're not gonna call Doyle until I can produce Mrs. Thorwald's body.
What we've got to do is find a way to get into that apartment.
He's packing.
Uh-oh.
Here, get me a pencil.
Stella, get me some note paper.
It's up here someplace.
There it is.
You did it, Thorwald.
You did it.
Look out, Lisa.
He's coming.
You never should have let her do it.
If he ever...
Look. Look. Look.
Well, thank heaven that's over.
All right if I have a drink?
Sure, go ahead.
There's no doubt about it. He's leaving.
It's just a question of when.
Mind if I use that portable keyhole?
Go ahead, just as long as you tell me what you're looking at.
I wonder...
Wonder what?
Miss Lonelyheart's just laid out something that looks like rhodium tri-eckonal capsules.
You can tell from here?
I've handled enough of those red pills to put everybody in Hackensack to sleep for the winter.
Well, does she have enough of them to...
No. It will make the rest easy to...
Wasn't that close?
What was his reaction. I mean, when he looked at the note?
Well, it wasn't the kind of an expression that would get him a quick loan at the bank.
Jeff, the handbag!
Suppose Mrs. Thorwald's wedding ring is among the jewelry he has in that handbag?
Now, during the phone conversation he held up three rings.
One with a diamond, one with a big stone of some sort and then just a plain gold band.
And the last thing she would leave behind would be a wedding ring.
Stella, do you ever leave yours at home?
The only way anybody could get that ring would be to chop off my finger.
Let's go down and find out what's buried in the garden.
Why not? I've always wanted to meet Mrs. Thorwald.
- What are you two talking about?
- You got a shovel?
A shovel? Of course I don't have a shovel.
There's probably one in the basement.
Jeff, if you're squeamish, just don't look.
Squeamish?
I'm not squeamish.
I just don't want you two to end up like that dog ended up. That's all.
Oh, you know, Miss Fremont, he might just have something there.
Just hold on.
Here, take this.
No sense taking any chances in this thing.
Here, give me the phone book.
What for?
Maybe I can get him out of that apartment.
We only need a few minutes.
I'll see if I can get about 15 minutes.
How?
Thorwald.
Thorwald...
Thorwald...
Chelsea 27099.
We scared him once, maybe we can scare him again.
Well, I guess I'm using that word "we" a little freely.
I mean, you're taking all the chances.
Shall we vote him in, Stella?
Unanimously.
27099. Look out.
Chelsea.
Chelsea.
Go on, pick it up, Thorwald.
Go on, you're curious.
You wonder if it's your girlfriend calling, the one you killed for.
Go on, pick it up.
Hello?
Did you get my note?
Well, did you get it, Thorwald?
Who are you?
I'll give you a chance to find out.
Meet me in the bar at the Albert Hotel.
Do it right away.
Why should I?
A little business meeting...
To settle the estate of your late wife.
I don't know what you mean.
Come on. Quit stalling, Thorwald, or
I'll hang up and call the police.
I have only
$100 or so.
That's a start.
I'm at the Albert now.
I'll be looking for you.
Come on, Stella, let's go.
One of you keep an eye on this window.
If I see him coming back,
I'll signal with a flashbulb.
This is the Doyle residence.
Hello, this is L. B. Jefferies speaking.
I'm a friend of Mr. Doyle.
Who's this?
This is a babysitter.
Oh. Uh...
When do you expect them in?
Well, I'm hired till 1:00. They went to dinner and maybe a nightclub.
I see.
If he calls in, would you have him get in touch with L. B. Jefferies right away?
I might have quite a surprise for him.
Well, do we have your number, Mr. Jefferies?
He has it.
Good night.
Good night.
Stella was wrong about Miss Lonelyheart.
Lisa, what are you...
Don't do...
Lisa, what are you doing? Don't go...
Come on, come on!
Get out of there!
She said ring Thorwald's phone the second you see him come back.
I'm gonna ring it right now!
Oh, no. Give her another minute.
All right, fellows, let's try it once from the beginning.
Miss Lonelyheart.
Oh, call the police!
Operator.
Get me the police, sixth precinct.
Yes, sir.
Mr. Jefferies, the music stopped her.
What... Lisa!
Lisa!
Precinct 6,
Sergeant Allgood.
Hello. Hello. Look, a man is assaulting a woman at 125 West 9th Street.
Second floor, at the rear.
Make it fast!
Your name?
L. B. Jefferies.
Phone number?
Chelsea 25598.
The door was open.
- I told you...
- Oh, no!
Let go of me! Jeff!
Oh, no!
Jeff! Jeff!
Jeff!
Lisa!
Stella, what do we do?
Jeff!
- Jeff!
- Well, here they come.
What's she trying to do?
Why doesn't she turn him in?
She's a smart girl.
"Smart girl"? She'll get herself arrested.
It'll get her out of there, won't it?
Look, the wedding ring!
Turn off the light!
He's seen us!
How long do you think he'll stay there?
Well, unless he's dumber than I think he is, he won't wait until his lease is up.
Get my billfold out of the drawer in the table there.
What do you need money for?
I'm gonna bail
Lisa out of jail.
You know, you could leave her there till next Tuesday, then you could sneak safely away as planned.
Yeah, let's see. $127.
How much do you need?
Well, this is first-offense burglary, that's about $250.
- Lisa's handbag.
- Yeah.
How much does she have?
Fifty cents.
Here, take this.
Look, I got $20 or so in my purse.
What about the rest?
What about the rest?
When those cops see Lisa, they'll even contribute.
Well, hurry up.
Just a minute.
Hurry up!
Jefferies.
All right.
What is it now?
Doyle, I've got something really big for you.
Why did I have to return your call?
Look, Jeff! Don't louse up my night with another mad killer...
Listen to me! Listen to me! Lisa's in jail.
She got arrested.
- Your Lisa?
- My Lisa.
Boy, you should have seen her. She got into Thorwald's apartment.
But then he came back, and the only way I could get her out was to call the police.
- I told you...
- I know you told me!
She went in to get evidence and she came out with evidence.
- Like what?
- Like what?
Like Mrs. Thorwald's wedding ring.
That's like what.
If that woman was alive, she'd be wearing that ring. Right?
- A possibility.
- A possibility. It's a fact!
He killed a dog last night because the dog was scratching around in the garden.
You know why? Because he had something buried in that garden that the dog scented.
Like an old ham bone?
Look, I don't know what pet names
Thorwald had for his wife, but I'll tell you this, all those trips at night with that metal suitcase, he wasn't taking out his possessions, because his possessions are still up in the apartment.
Perhaps it was old "ham bone."
Yeah, in sections.
And I'll tell you something else.
All the telephone calls he made were long distance, all right?
Now, if he called his wife long distance on the day she left, after she arrived in Merritsville, why did she write a card to him saying that she'd arrived in Merritsville?
Why did she do that?
Where'd they take Lisa?
Precinct 6.
I sent somebody over with the bail money.
Maybe you won't need it.
I'll run it down, Jeff.
All right. All right.
Now hurry up, will you?
This fellow knows he's being watched.
He's not gonna wait around forever.
Hurry up.
If that ring checks out, we'll give him an escort.
- So long, Jeff.
- So long.
Hello. Hello. Tom, I think Thorwald's left.
I don't see...
Hello...
What do you want from me?
Your friend, the girl, could have turned me in.
Why didn't she?
What is it you want? A lot of money?
I don't have any money.
Say something.
Say something! Tell me what you want!
Can you get me that ring back?
No.
Tell her to bring it back!
I can't. The police have it by now.
Lisa! Doyle!
Over there!
Look! Look, over in that apartment!
Doyle!
Creele!
Give me your .38!
I'm sorry, Jeff. I got here as fast as I could!
Oh, Mr. Jefferies! Don't let anybody touch him.
Get my medical bag from upstairs.
Oh, Lisa, sweetie, if anything had happened to you...
Oh, shut up.
I'm all right.
Gee, I'm proud of you!
You got enough for a search warrant now?
Oh, yeah, sure.
- Lieutenant Doyle!
- Yeah?
Is he okay?
He's alive.
Thorwald's ready to take us on a tour of the East River.
Did he say what was buried in the flower bed?
Yeah. He said the dog got too inquisitive, so he dug it up.
It's in a hat box over in his apartment.
- Want to look?
- No, thanks.
I don't want any part of her.
I hope it's gonna be a hit.
This is the first release.
I'd love to hear it.
I can't tell you what this music has meant to me.
Lisa, with your starry eyes
Now, let's try it again, puppy.
Stay still. Stay.
Hold me and whisper the sweet words I'm yearning for
Drown me in kisses
- Stanley!
- Hi, baby!
Caresses I'm burning for
My, look what the
Army's done for you!
Lisa, every touch is new ecstasy
The Army's made me hungry. What've you got in the icebox to eat?
Boy, it's good to be home.
Lisa, angels dance when you cling to me
I don't care if you help me or not, but if you'd told me you'd quit your job, we wouldn't have gotten married.
Oh, honey, come on...
If this is dreaming
I hope I'll never wake
But dream forever
In your arms, oh, Lisa
Lisa
Julie.
Oh, hello there.
- Hello, yourself.
- You got a minute?
Just about.
- Where's the cowboy?
- Over at the pool.
How is he?
Well, Steve, these operations aren't any picnic.
Sure, sure, I know.
But I got the medicine for him.
Look at this ranch. Six hundred acres.
Good barns.
Ninety miles from Phoenix. Irrigation.
Another year of work to swell the kitty, you add that to the VA loan, we're in business.
- You'll have to forget it.
- Forget it? What do you mean?
- He's going to pull out of this, isn't he?
- He'll pull out.
But he won't be able to go back to rigging oil derricks...
...or working in lumber camps, or anything like that.
He'll have to take it easy for a while.
- For how long?
- A year. Maybe more.
Hm. That's tough.
It'll be a lot tougher if he has to come back here.
Yeah.
Well, that's that.
I'm sorry, Steve.
Have you told him?
I'll handle it.
Watch out, Jack.
- Hi, cowboy.
Hi.
Hello, fellas.
- How you doing?
- Fine, fine.
Pull up a stretcher and I'll tell you all about my operation.
That's what I hear. Lucky 10th, huh?
Anything new on the VA loan?
Answered a lot of questions.
Filled in a form.
- The old routine, huh?
- Yeah.
No matter how you slice it, it's still the Army.
You know, I've been thinking, maybe we're backing the wrong horse.
- How do you mean?
- Ranching. It's a risky business, Bob.
I've been talking to a lot of guys.
You buy yourself a place, put your heart into it.
Maybe the market drops out from under you.
There's a drought, or your steers get foot rot.
You're back where you started from.
Besides, I've been thinking of something else, a gas station, maybe.
- A gas station?
- What's wrong with that?
At least when you sell a gallon of gas you get the cash right in your mitt.
Now look, Steve, for three years we were holed up inside a stinking tank...
...and all that time dreaming about space.
Enough space to call a ranch.
For three more years we save every nickel we can lay our hands on.
We read ourselves blind about cattle, fodder, marketing.
You think I can blow all that out my barracks bag overnight?
You're crazy.
You want a gas station, okay.
Me, I still want the ranch.
- That's what I said.
- Huh?
The smell of gas makes me sick.
You get out of this place and we start ranching.
Hark! The herald angels sing
Merry Christmas.
Peace on earth and mercy mild
- Oh. Hello, Miss Benson.
- Good evening, doctor.
I thought you were off tonight.
Oh, I was, sir.
But Florence had a heavy day, and I don't mind.
That's nice of you.
I'm sure the patient in number 12 won't mind either.
Well, he can stand a little Christmas cheer.
- Is he still worried about that friend of his?
- I'm afraid so.
That's too bad.
See he has a good night's rest.
I ordered a hypo. Repeat if necessary.
Merry Christmas.
It came upon a midnight clear
That glorious song of old
From angels bending near the earth
To touch their harps of gold
Peace on the earth, goodwill to men
Steve. Steve. Steve!
Bob, what is it? What's the matter?
Nothing.
I just had a crazy dream.
It must have been.
Here, you lie back.
You sounded as though you were being scalped.
Oh, we...
We'd gone fishing.
Steve and me. Up in the mountains.
Next thing I knew, he was falling off a cliff.
I tried to throw him a parachute.
It was all cockeyed.
It just goes to show you, always take a parachute when you go fishing.
Yeah.
- I don't suppose he's called?
- No, he hasn't.
Not even on Christmas Eve.
Julie, would you phone his hotel again?
I just called this morning.
Why don't we wait until tomorrow.
Give him another day.
Wait. I've been waiting six weeks.
Something's wrong. I know it.
Steve's not the kind to run out on anybody.
He came to L.A. just to be around till I got on my feet again.
- Why should he suddenly disappear?
- Maybe he had to go out of town.
Where he can't get in touch with you.
There are telephones out of town, and post offices.
He could have dropped me a card.
Well, you know what the mails are at Christmas.
Bob, I just saw Dr. Nolan.
You've made your last trip to surgery.
What'd they do? Give up?
You'll be out of here in 10 days.
On the level?
Lucky 13, huh?
Well, you've been around here a long time.
We get tired of the same old faces.
With one or two exceptions.
Same here. With one exception.
Why do you always get romantic after your hypo?
Merry Christmas.
Say, there's package in the top drawer over there. Would you get it?
Sure.
- This?
- Yeah. Go ahead, open it.
Merry Christmas to you.
It's very sweet of you.
Is that the best you can do?
Anything more is against regulations.
Tell them you couldn't read the small print.
- Good night, Bob.
- Night.
Bob?
Bob Corey?
Are you Bob Corey?
It's all right, Julie.
I'm gonna sleep.
Don't go to sleep.
Bob, please.
I've come about Steve.
Steve Connolly.
He keeps calling for you.
Steve?
You must listen to me.
Tell me what to do. Steve is hurt.
Badly hurt.
Yeah, I know.
- It's the cliff.
- Cliff? There was no cliff.
You better call Julie.
They gave me something to make me sleep.
No. Please.
Bob, please.
I'm sorry.
But you've got to listen.
I don't know what to do.
What...? What happened?
It was an accident.
His spine, it's smashed.
The doctor says nothing can be done.
I thought I was strong but I can't stand it any longer.
The way he looks at me, begging, the pain in his eyes...
...he asked me to put him out of it.
You mean, kill him?
Is it right, is it wrong?
That's all I want to know.
- Yes or no.
- No.
Tell him I said no.
The doctor's crazy.
They can put him together again.
- They did me.
- But he can't go on suffering like this.
It has been 10 days.
Ten days?
Tell him... Tell him 10 more.
I'll be out of here.
Tell him I said,
"Hang on no matter what."
That's what I wanted you to say.
There's a... A pad.
Write... Write the address.
Ten days.
Ten days.
Ten days.
Ten days.
Good morning.
- Morning, Corey.
- Hello, doc.
- How are you feeling?
- Fine, fine.
Look, I can leave today, can't I?
You said 10 days.
- Gonna hold me to it?
- I'm gonna try.
Well, let's have a look.
Up on the bed with you.
You know, Corey, you're gonna be a famous man one of these days.
I'm writing a paper about you for the medical journal.
Thirteen little operations and look at you.
Practically a brand-new spine. That hurt?
No.
Look, doc, don't think I don't appreciate what you're doing for me.
I'd like to get out of here as soon as possible.
Of course. Roll over.
You must understand one thing, son, you shouldn't do anything heavier...
...than push a pencil around for the next year or two.
I hear you and your partner have got a lot of plans.
For all I know my partner may be dead.
Oh, yes.
That exotic vision from the unknown on Christmas Eve.
Complete with accent. Now, son...
Oh, I know it's a big joke around the hospital, doc.
But she was here. I saw her.
You also saw her write her address on the pad. You know...
Yeah, I know all about the guard at the gate. And that nobody issued a pass.
Julie's played that record till it's worn out.
But I also know it was Christmas Eve.
Maybe the guard dozed off. Or maybe there wasn't anybody at the reception desk.
I've got a better explanation.
You've had a tough siege of it, Corey.
You've gone through a lot of pain.
There were times you wished somebody would put you out of it.
Added to that you were worried about the disappearance of your best friend.
Given a hypo, started dreaming.
What more natural than for you to identify yourself with your friend.
You had one dream about him already, remember?
Now the identification's complete.
It's Steve who's lying flat on his back with your busted spine, pleading to die.
Believe me, son, just a hallucination.
- Oh, excuse me, doctor.
- That's all right. We've just finished.
Telegram for you, Bob.
For me?
Well?
It's from Chicago.
It says, "Been on the move.
Will get in touch with you.
Everything fine." Signed, Steve.
There you are, Corey, you see?
Pink elephants.
Just like I said. Get your clothes.
Stop by my office on your way out.
Thanks, doctor.
- Well, what are you waiting for?
- Hm?
You heard him. You're a free man.
Yeah. Yeah, that's right.
And I'm a free woman.
At least for the weekend.
You want to meet me in town?
Well, I can catch the 5:10 bus and be at the Biltmore by 9:30.
I'll change when I get there.
Looks like you stuck me for dinner.
Come to think of it, it's about time that I fed you.
Hop in, son.
- Which way you going?
- Same way you are.
Hop in.
Wait a minute. What's the idea?
- You're Bob Corey, aren't you?
- Yeah, that's right.
Hop in. Come on.
In here, son.
This is Bob Corey. Captain Garcia.
How are you, Corey?
Sit down, son, sit down.
- Oh, uh, care for a smoke?
- No, thanks.
Well, they tell me out at the hospital you've had quite a siege.
Feel well enough to answer a few questions?
Sure. If I know the answers.
Good. Good.
When was the last time you saw Steve Connolly?
Seven, eight weeks ago.
- Do you remember the exact date?
- Yeah.
November the 18th.
He's been killed.
Is that what you're trying to tell me?
No, he was very much alive the last time I saw him.
Then what's this all about?
Why all the mystery?
Your friend, Steve, is wanted for murder.
- Murder?
- Did you ever hear of Solly Blayne?
The gambler?
The guy who was shot a few weeks ago?
- That's right.
- Well, yeah.
But you don't think that Steve...
That's crazy. How would he get mixed up with a guy like that?
We asked that same question, we got an answer...
...from detective headquarters,
New York City.
Steve Connolly, before the war, professional gambler.
Operating in New York, New Jersey.
Arrested November 1941, gambling charge, conspiracy to defraud.
Acquitted. Lack of evidence.
Enlisted, U.S. Army, December 1941.
- No record since.
- I know all that.
So he got off to a bad start. What of it?
In the Army he changed. Guys changed.
Some of them changed back.
So let's get down to cases.
Any idea where your pal might be?
I, uh...
Oh, that telegram you were just going to tell me about.
It wasn't from Steve Connolly.
A woman sent it.
They located her in Chicago this morning.
A woman? Who is she?
What did she look like?
She's an older edition of her daughter.
A nurse out at the hospital, called Julie Benson. Do you know her?
Sure, I know her.
It seems the Benson girl got her mother to send the wire so you'd quit worrying.
All right, so Steve didn't send it.
That doesn't mean he killed anyone.
Why were you so worried?
Why did you keep calling the Fremont Hotel?
Because I wanted to see him.
Is anything wrong with that?
Captain, you got a bad lead.
You don't know Steve.
He was playing it straight.
For years we broke our necks to get a ranch.
- He wouldn't mess all that up.
- Sentiment, son, sentiment.
- In my job I have to deal with facts.
- I'm giving you facts.
Then let me give you some.
December 4th, 7:12 p.m., a call comes into Homicide...
...that a man's been killed on Marden Drive, out in the Los Feliz district.
The house belonged to Solly Blayne, but he wasn't going to occupy it any longer.
He was lying dead on the living room floor.
And only his wife was sorry.
- When do we get the house...
- Wait a minute. Just be patient.
Take it easy, you'll get your story.
Any footprints, George?
- Yeah. Everybody's.
- That's too bad.
What's the story?
How about a lead?
Give us a break, will you?
Very simple. At first the guy calls up to make sure Solly's at home.
Few minutes later, he drives up in his car, walks across the lawn to this window.
There sits Solly in his chair, sipping a highball.
The guy lets him have it. Three slugs.
Yeah, good shooting.
- Excuse me, captain.
- Yes, doctor?
- Mrs. Blayne must get some rest.
- She's in no condition...
- Yes. It's been pretty rough on her.
- We won't need her anymore tonight.
- Thank you.
- Oh, uh, Doctor Anstead.
- Yes?
Tell her we'll have to leave somebody in the house.
- I understand.
Oh, captain?
Yes? What is it?
- There's a call in your car.
- All right. Thank you.
- D-5 to 1.
- D-1 to 5.
The room clerk from the Fremont Hotel just called in.
Solly Blayne was in an hour ago.
He saw a man named Steve Connolly.
Over.
D-5, roger.
Fremont Hotel. Fourth and Olive.
Solly Blayne was there an hour ago.
- What room is Steve Connolly in?
- 228. Come in a half hour ago.
Keep away from that phone.
Don't worry. It was me who called you.
I was the one who recognized Solly.
It is feared the murder of Solly Blayne...
...may be the beginning of full-scale racketeer warfare within Los Angeles.
The police department has known for some time...
All right, open up, Connolly, police.
Hold it. You're liable to hit a taxpayer.
That was the last we saw of Steve Connolly.
I don't have any actual proof that he killed Solly Blayne.
No witnesses, no prints, no established motives.
But until I get evidence to the contrary,
Steve has to be number one boy on my list.
Why? Because he ran away?
Who wouldn't?
Look, captain, Solly Blayne comes to see him about something.
Then he hears on the radio that Solly's been killed.
Next, you're pounding on his door.
To Steve that can only mean...
...you're gonna pin it on him.
- A man comes back if he's innocent.
Not if he's lying somewhere with a busted spine.
Yes, they told me out at the hospital about your mysterious visitor.
They think it was all a dream.
What the doctors call an aberration.
I don't care what they call it.
I saw the girl, I tell you.
I can still hear her voice.
She said there was an accident.
The doctor could do nothing for him.
Steve wanted to die.
Does that sound like a dream?
You don't seem the kind to get aberrations.
I'll play along with you.
Check every accident report for December.
Any doctor who looks after him has to file a report. That's the law.
- Okay?
- Thanks, captain.
All right. You'll hear from us.
- Where are you staying in town?
- I'm going over to the Biltmore.
Nice hotel.
Stay in it as much as possible.
Yeah. Sure.
- Goodbye.
- So long.
Say, Corey.
You ever play cops and robbers?
Why, sure. When I was a kid.
Take my word for it, it's a kid's game.
Let us find Steve Connolly.
Say, Mac, take me to the Fremont Hotel instead of the Biltmore.
- The Fremont?
- Yeah, yeah. I changed my mind.
Brother, when you change it, you really change it.
- Yes, sir.
- I'd like a room, please.
Register.
- How long you gonna be with us?
- I, uh, don't know yet.
Two dollars a day, $12 a week.
No noise after 12:00.
Okay.
Say, uh, how about room 228.
Is that vacant?
247's got more light.
I'd like 228, if you don't mind.
Why...?
Oh. Mr. Corey.
I should have recognized your voice.
- You called here often enough.
- Well, do I get the room?
You won't find anything.
Police cleaned it out weeks ago.
I know all that.
- lf you wait, the boy will help you up.
- I'll walk.
Mr. Corey, if you're such a good friend of Connolly's...
...maybe you'd like to pay this bill.
He went out the back way.
- How much is it?
- Twelve dollars for rent.
Twenty cents for phone calls.
Connolly shows up, you get it back.
Yeah. I bet.
Right up the stairs, down the hall.
- Yes?
- Can I come in, Mr. Corey?
- Well...
- I'm Sybil.
Mr. Steve used to talk about you.
We were good friends, me and Mr. Steve.
Oh?
- Come in, come in.
- Thank you.
He was my pet on this floor.
And every week there'd be a dollar bill in this room for me...
...with a darling little note.
Oh, he was a gentleman,
Mr. Steve was.
The best we had on the second floor.
Well, right now he could use a character reference.
I know. He shouldn't have run away.
That was his mistake.
You don't think he killed anybody, do you?
Money makes a man do rare things,
Mr. Corey.
- The money was the trouble.
- Money? What money?
The $40,000 he and Mr. Blayne were fighting about.
Forty thousand dollars?
I'm afraid you have the wrong Connolly.
Well, I know what I heard, Mr. Corey.
- You heard them?
- It was the night Mr. Blayne was killed.
Just a little before 9:00 it was.
I had worked my way down to the second floor.
I saw this pair of legs coming down the hall.
Living so close to the floor most the time...
...I can tell a lot about people from their shoes.
I didn't like this pair right off.
Too shiny.
Oh. Hello, Solly.
Aren't you gonna ask me in, champ?
Sorry. I was just on my way out.
You just broke your date.
Inside, champ.
A friend of mine tells me those suckers went for a hundred grand in the game.
Not 20.
What's the difference?
The difference is I've got another 40,000 coming on the split.
And if I don't get it by Saturday,
I'll let the law collect it for me.
What are you gonna do? Sue?
Better than that, champ.
The treasury department pays plenty for a tip...
...on someone holding out on income tax.
They also put guys in jail.
Okay, so what?
So? Forty grand.
By Saturday.
That was all.
But I knew Mr. Steve was getting into real trouble.
I've seen it coming too.
He was worrying a lot before it happened.
Pacing up and down nights, like he couldn't sleep.
Did he have any other visitors?
Was there ever a girl?
Dark hair, spoke with a foreign accent?
No. No, I don't know anything else about him.
Except this.
He left it. Mr. Steve did, with a dollar pinned on it.
They were always darling notes.
Peerless Mortuary?
You know, I wondered at the time what a young man like Mr. Steve...
...was doing with a card from a mortuary.
And over in Glendale too.
Ms. Hallum, call Mr. Shelton.
Tell him the arrangements have been made for 4.
Yes, sir.
This gentleman is waiting for you.
- Did you want to see me?
- Yeah. Uh...
A friend of mine had your card. I, uh...
Corey. Bob Corey.
Yeah.
What's the matter, cowboy?
Don't you recognize me?
Ben Arno.
Arno. Corporal Arno.
- That's right.
- Well, well.
How are you, cowboy?
Fine, fine. Now I've seen everything.
Don't let the makeup fool you.
This is for the customers.
That is, for the customers' next of kin.
You're not here on business, are you?
I hope you haven't, as we say, lost a loved one.
Oh, no, Ben. Nothing like that. I, uh...
Good. Come on upstairs.
- Have a seat. Make yourself comfortable.
- Thanks.
- How do you like the layout?
- Oh, swell.
- But isn't it kind of, uh...
- I know what you mean.
- It's kind of close to, uh...
- Yeah.
Gives me the willies too sometimes.
Especially on foggy nights.
But I say to myself, "Ben, it pays the rent."
And that does it.
Well, what happened to the nightclub business?
You used to say if you ever got back to 52nd Street...
...you'd never leave.
- I went back all right but I missed the boat.
The guys who ran those joints during the war years got all the gravy.
I got there, the shutters were going up as fast as they could get lumber.
So I figured all the business must have gone West.
And I came out to look things over.
Found a place too out on Sunset Strip. Looked good.
Then I tried to get a loan. No dice.
The banks like to back a sure thing, they said.
For instance, I said.
Something certain, they said.
All right, what's certain?
Two things. Death and taxes.
So I got to thinking, who comes to California?
There's the ones who come here to live, and the ones who come to die.
I couldn't get the live ones without a nightclub, so, meet Ben Arno, mortician.
Well, like I said, death and taxes.
What brought you in here, cowboy?
I'm trying to find Steve Connolly.
I thought maybe you could help me out.
He had your card, and I wondered how he got it.
Oh, sure. I gave it to him myself. Why?
Well, the cops are looking for him.
They say he killed Solly Blayne.
- Steve?
- Yeah.
I read about that in the papers.
There was no mention of Steve.
Well, they're looking for him anyhow.
Where'd you hear about this?
The cops picked me up this morning, wanted to know if I had any ideas.
- And?
- The only lead I had was your card.
How do you like that?
I should've made him listen.
He was heading for trouble.
- I warned him.
- When was that?
A couple of months ago it was.
At the fights.
I go every Friday night.
I have a permanent ringside seat.
Generally I just catch the main event.
But this night the prelims were snafued.
And the last fight was going on when I checked in.
That's it, Bingo.
Go on, Bingo. Knock him down.
Put him down. Put him down. Attaboy.
Give me your program.
That ain't Tiger Wallace.
The Tiger's sick. Substitution.
The name's Connolly.
Now he's sicker than the Tiger.
Ho-ho-ho!
One, two, three, four...
I couldn't believe my eyes.
I only saw a few seconds of the fight.
Half that time you were flat on your face.
Do you know a quicker way to make 50 bucks?
Well, maybe not quicker, but healthier.
- Look, if you need a job...
- Sure.
In the nightclub business, you could use a bouncer.
You saw how I could handle a tough customer.
Who said anything about nightclubs?
- See you outside.
- Yeah.
Mortician?
- You mean you're a guy...
- Please.
My partner takes care of all that.
I'm just a front office man.
And the way you looked in there tonight...
...I thought I was gonna have a new customer.
Another round and you would've had me.
Look, I meant what I said.
If there's anything I can do.
I know quite a few people over in Glendale.
Business people.
And take it from me, it's a steady job what pays off.
Thanks. But a steady job in Glendale is not what I'm looking for.
Steve, don't get fouled up.
You know how easy that is.
I know, Ben, I know.
Well, give me a ring, huh?
We'll cut up a few touches?
Sure, Ben, see you.
So long, Steve.
That was the last I saw of him.
He never called me.
Now I wish I never let him out of my sight.
I don't get it.
Steve never had on a pair of gloves in his life.
- He wasn't broke.
- He was pretty upset about something.
No guy would take the shellacking he took just for laughs.
Yes, Miss Hallum.
Oh. I'll be right down.
- How about dinner?
- No, I can't tonight, Ben. I got a date.
Well, some other time. Business.
Keep in touch.
Okay, Ben.
I don't know, I'm stymied.
Why does a guy go into the ring and get his block knocked off for 50 bucks?
How does he get mixed up with a character like Solly Blayne?
And the $40,000.
Where would he get that kind of money?
I got a hundred questions and not one answer.
If you don't stop, you're going to worry yourself right back into the hospital.
I can't quit worrying.
This whole business is my fault. When you told Steve I had to forget the ranch...
...he tried to steer me onto something else,
I wouldn't listen. What happens?
He goes out for some quick dough, so he wouldn't let me down.
What's he got to show for it?
A murder rap.
Maybe lying somewhere with a busted spine.
- Some more coffee, senor?
- No, thanks. Just the check.
Anniversary. Married 25 years.
What I wouldn't give to talk to the corpse of Solly Blayne.
- I beg your pardon, senor?
- Nothing.
Muchas gracias.
Bob, the anniversary.
- What about it?
- A man and his wife.
- Wasn't Solly Blayne married?
- Yes.
She was there when he was killed.
That might be just as good as talking to Solly.
That's right.
Remind me to tell you that I love you.
Let's go.
- Yes?
Mrs. Blayne?
If it's about the house,
I'd rather you came back in the morning.
We'd like to talk to you now if we could.
Please, Mrs. Blayne. It's very important.
Will you come in?
It's a shame you have to see the house looking like this.
It was really quite lovely.
We didn't come to talk about the house,
Mrs. Blayne.
My name is Bob Corey.
I'm a friend of Steve Connolly's.
What do you want?
We'd like to ask you some questions, if you don't mind.
I have nothing to say to you.
Will you please go?
We don't mean to be heartless,
Mrs. Blayne. But we're desperate.
I'm a nurse at the Veterans Hospital.
Bob was a patient there until this morning.
We just found out that his best friend has been accused of murder.
The murder of your husband.
We know he didn't do it.
He couldn't have done it.
But we have nowhere to turn, except to you.
If there's anything you can tell us.
Won't you sit down?
What was it you wanted to know?
Did your husband ever mention Steve?
I knew none of his friends.
He didn't want me to.
You see, there were two Solly Blaynes.
One was my husband, and one was a gambler.
My husband always left that Solly Blayne outside.
I hate to ask you this, but could you tell us anything about the night itself?
It was Thursday, and the maid's day off.
Solly was in here, having his evening highball.
I was in the kitchen getting dinner.
It was to be a little private celebration.
Solly had just told me he had won $40,000, which he would receive on Saturday.
We were going on a long trip together.
I hoped it might mean an end to his gambling.
What is it, Diggy? Your pal next door?
Solly?
Solly? What was...?
Solly! Oh!
Solly.
Get the doctor.
Dr. Anstead. Hurry.
Hello, Dr. Anstead?
This is Mrs. Blayne.
Solly's been hurt, badly.
Hurry, please.
But Solly was gone.
There was nothing the doctor could do.
Nothing anybody could do.
Is there anything else you'd like to know?
No. No, I guess not.
Then if you'll forgive me, I'm very tired.
You've been very kind, Mrs. Blayne.
- You got a record of those phone calls?
- What do you think?
- We just tack them on the bill?
- Never mind.
- I said have you got a record?
- lf it says he made them, he made them.
I paid for those phone calls,
I want to know what they were.
It's a lot of trouble.
I have to go through last month's book.
Okay, okay.
This make it any easier?
Helps.
Let's see.
Well, now, let's take a look in this.
Come on, mumbles, hurry it up, will you?
Mumbles.
Here they are.
Now, the same day.
Ulrich-1-2-3-4.
Gladstone-4-1-3-1.
- Thanks.
- I told you.
When you hear the tone, the time will be exactly 11:32 and three quarters.
Ehh.
They didn't have the right time in this hotel.
Gladstone.
Well, it's about time.
Where are you anyway?
I've been sitting here for an hour, ready to leave.
I'm sorry, I think you made a mistake.
- Say, who is this?
- This is Steve. Steve Connolly.
- Oh, you must want Bonnie.
- Yeah, yeah, let me talk to Bonnie.
She's out. I don't know when she'll be back. You know Bonnie.
Well, look, uh, maybe I'll stop by.
What's that address again?
There'll be nobody home.
I'm leaving myself in a few minutes.
You better give me the address anyhow,
I want to send some flowers.
Flowers? It's 1698, North Serrano.
- Flowers yet.
- Thanks.
Who are you? What are you doing here?
It's okay. You needn't be frightened.
Frightened? A guy I never saw drops from the ceiling...
...and tells me not to be frightened.
You better get out of here before I start screaming.
When I scream, they can hear me as far as Cucamonga.
How did you get in here anyway?
Well, your roommate let me in.
Yeah? What for?
And what are you doing with that?
She asked me to meet her here.
- Lisa?
- Yeah, Lisa.
Why didn't you say that in the first place?
You didn't give me much of a chance.
- I've been worried about her.
She goes away and doesn't even send me a card. How is she anyway?
- She sounds all right.
- Good.
Well, sit down.
I'll take the chill off with some coffee.
Thanks.
I don't know where Lisa will sleep.
Three in here and it'll be like a submarine.
It'll give me a good excuse to get rid of Myrna.
She keeps hours like a baby doctor.
Say, what's your name, anyhow?
Corey. Bob Corey.
I never heard Lisa mention you.
Well, I'm a friend of Steve's.
- Steve Connolly?
- Yeah.
- You know him?
- Sure, why?
- It seems there's been a little trouble.
- Because of Lou?
- Lou?
- Lou Walsh.
Oh, Lou. Yeah.
Yeah, I think that's what she wanted to talk to me about.
Oh.
I don't like it. I don't like it at all.
That guy Lou, he's poison.
The way he used to look at her. Like he'd kill anyone who even said her name.
A guy who loves you like that, that ain't love.
How long have they known each other?
Steve and Lisa?
She met him the same time I did.
The night the Topaz room folded.
That's where she and I used to work.
I'd finished for the night, and I was waiting at Lou's regular table.
Lisa was on her last number.
- Yes, sir?
- Mr. Walsh's table.
This way, please.
- She's good, huh?
- Yeah. Very good.
- Anything for you, sir?
- Nothing, thanks. We're leaving.
I'm Steve Connolly.
Lou sent me to pick up you and Bonnie.
I'm Bonnie. That was Lisa.
Oh, uh, Lisa, this is Steve Connolly.
Lou told me to bring you to the party.
- I told Lou on the phone that I was tired.
- He said you'd change your mind.
- And if I don't?
- We didn't get that far.
Do you mind if I have something to drink?
Waiter.
- Miss Raidoff would like a drink.
- Coffee, please.
- Yes, ma'am.
- Nothing for me.
It must be an important game tonight.
I heard a few blue chips rattle.
- Is there a big crowd?
- Not too big.
What she means, buster, is are they stinking?
They're businessmen from out of town.
They're stinking.
- Would you like another one of those?
- No, thanks.
How do you fit into the picture,
Mr. Connolly?
I work for Lou. New boy.
Sort of a handyman.
- And where did he find you?
- A sale. War surplus. Big reduction.
He's not only cute, he's funny.
Part of my job.
Every hour on the hour, a joke.
Lou likes jokes. He'll like you.
You're amusing, Mr. Connolly. And hard.
It's a hard world.
Well, shall we go to the party?
What would you do, Mr. Connolly?
It depends on what you want.
- Do you know what you want?
- Uh-huh.
- That's why I'm working for Lou.
- Then you better be careful.
I know exactly what Lou must have told you.
"Don't come back without her."
Can I drop you any place?
No.
I've changed my mind.
I think I'll go to the party.
Oh, Miss Lisa?
- Yes?
Mr. Lou wanted to see you as soon as you arrived.
- Hello, Lisa.
- Hello, Solly.
You've just won another mink coat, from me.
How nice.
Solly.
- Hello, Bonnie. How are you?
Never saw anything like it.
Give me a highball.
Try to keep my brain clear.
Nothing helps tonight.
That Lou Walsh just filled his third inside straight.
Do you know what we always say in Detroit?
When your luck starts running against you, start running.
I'll give it a few more hands.
If you're from Detroit, maybe you can get me a new car.
- Maybe I could.
- Without a bonus.
Hey...
...didn't you fight Bingo Brett last Friday?
Yeah. How did you recognize me on my feet?
- Connolly, you owe me a grand.
- Did you bet on me?
Not on you. Against Bingo.
I own him. He couldn't fight his way out of a paper bag.
Well, meet a torn paper bag.
- I'm Solly Blayne.
- How are you?
- What're you doing?
- Work for Lou.
- You're retired from the ring.
- Allergic to canvas.
Ha, ha. You'll probably get a bonus tonight.
Your boss is running wild in there.
Well, one more round.
Cards, I mean, champ.
Back to the lion's den.
- Say, she's all right. Who is she?
- Name, Lisa Raidoff.
Age 25. Weight 112.
- Unavailable.
- Yeah?
Miss Raidoff...
...l'm Dick Manning from Detroit.
- That's interesting.
Party sure brightened up when you came in here.
- Have a cigarette?
- No, thanks.
Have you been lucky tonight?
Well, not in the card game...
...but I wonder what my chances might be here.
Want to dance?
- Can you dance without music?
- We got music.
- Take five minutes, Rocky.
- Sure.
Sit back down there.
How much does a guy have to lose in Los Angeles to dance with some gal?
Wanna dance with me, chum?
I'm rough but I'm good.
- What? Are you trying to be funny?
- No, I'm just being nice.
But I can be funny too.
Why, this is a fine way to treat a guest.
When I'm in Detroit you can do the same for me.
- Now go find yourself a neutral corner.
- What a party.
He just wants to have something to brag about when he gets back home.
- Thank you. Lou will be grateful.
- That was on my own time.
Take five minutes anyway, Rocky.
You don't have to stay with me if you want to be with the guests.
I'm with a guest.
Must be 1:00, Mr. Connolly.
Every hour on the hour, a joke.
No joke.
What's the name of that?
- Why do you ask?
- I've heard it before.
- You must be mistaken.
- No.
No, I can even tell you where.
It was a little town a few miles outside of Vienna. Um...
- Vianashtak?
- That's it.
There was a beer joint.
It had a string orchestra.
Three old guys, they were playing that.
- How do you know?
- It was my home.
Oh.
Did you like my home?
We liked anyplace we could get out of the tank and stretch.
The beer joint was a bonus.
I remember we whistled that tune all the way into Vienna.
I'm glad you like it, Mr. Connolly.
My father wrote it.
- Your father?
- Yes...
...he told everyone he had written it for me...
...but that was only so I would practice.
And he was right too.
For a long time
I wouldn't play anything else.
- It made me feel important.
- Must be a good feeling.
It was.
- You know, I envy you, Mr. Connolly.
- Why?
- You said you know what you want.
- It's not much.
A buddy and I are...
What?
If I told you, you'd think it was my 2:00 joke.
Maybe you will tell me some other time.
Maybe...
...when I get out of the jungle.
The jungle.
That's what Lou calls it.
Only the strong or the cunning can live.
The gospel according to Lou Walsh.
And according to you?
Lou doesn't ask me.
I'd been holding my breath all the time those two were at the piano.
It was the first time I'd ever seen Lisa without the ghost on her shoulder.
If Lou had come out of that card room...
...Steve would have been right back in war surplus.
Um, this party was at
Lou Walsh's apartment, huh?
- Where does he live?
- At the Brentwood Palms...
...but he's in Miami now.
- How do you know?
- I called up.
They said he'd checked out and that's where he was.
Ooh! The coffee.
You say Solly Blayne lost in that game?
Well, he said he was clean.
It's when I heard he got bumped off that I called up.
He's a pretty good guy. I got all excited.
Naturally, knowing him and all.
Say, do you take cream and sugar?
I said do you take cream and sugar?
Hey.
Hey, what's the idea?
Too bad. A young girl like that had a long time to live.
If there's anything I can do.
If she had a family.
It's too late for that now. I warned you last night about playing bird dog.
If you'd come to me with those numbers maybe she wouldn't be lying on a slab.
Don't you think he feels bad?
Feeling bad won't bring the Willis girl back to life.
- Bluth, see what's holding up Ballistics.
- Yes, sir.
You can't blame Bob. How could he know this was going to happen?
Don't mind me. I'm balling him out because I'm sore at myself.
I should have got that phone bill from Burns...
...and who knows, maybe
Bonnie would have caught it anyway.
Captain.
- Yes?
I've got 24 more rooms to clean and it's Saturday. My half-day.
Okay, go ahead.
But from now on remember:
It's a criminal offense to withhold information from police.
The Good Book says silence is golden.
So I just kept my mouth shut.
It also says "Speak and ye shall be heard."
Remember.
Yes, sir.
Next time? Oh, my.
Uh, what about me, captain?
I've got one for you too.
"Go ye and do likewise."
Likewise.
Garcia. Yeah?
Yeah?
Tell them to keep looking.
Miami police can't locate any Lou Walsh or Lisa Raidoff.
Well?
Looks like we're up against an old friend, two peas in a pod.
Well, I'll be a...
What is it, captain?
Same gun that killed Solly Blayne killed Bonnie Willis.
Then that means that Steve's in the clear, doesn't it?
A man with a busted back doesn't shoot people.
Maybe he didn't kill the Willis girl.
What's the connection between the Willis girl and Solly Blayne?
At the moment, I have one connection.
They knew a character named Lou Walsh.
- What did you find out?
- It's like Mr. Arno says.
The Stadium never saw Connolly after that night and never wants to.
What about Walsh?
- Saw the manager of Brentwood Palms.
Walsh checked out for Miami the day before Solly was bumped.
There's doubt about Miami.
Get a description?
Yeah. Five-ten, 190 pounds.
Dark hair. Nice smile.
No pictures, huh?
No. Those deck and dice guys, they're camera-shy.
Okay.
Well, that seems to make it unanimous.
No pictures, no auto license, no bank account, no tax returns.
Somewhere in the city, there's a guy fracturing window panes.
And I suspect his name is Lou Walsh.
Take my advice, Corey. Be careful.
He didn't care if you talked to
Sybil, the desk clerk or Arno.
None of them could lead you to him.
But the minute you got to Bonnie,
Lou Walsh came alive.
That's why Bonnie was killed.
Take my advice, keep away from windows, or you'll wind up in Arno's.
Thanks for the plug, but that's one piece of business I can do without.
Speaking of business,
I have a funeral in about...
...holy cow, 12 minutes.
All right, you can go.
You get a ticket, I got a pal.
- Thanks.
- Thanks for coming in.
I'll drop around the hotel.
- Keep an eye on him, will you, Julie?
- Sure, Ben.
What are you gonna do about finding Steve?
You think we could run this office without a phone? Hello. What?
Oh. Oh, I'm sorry. What's that?
Who?
Hold on a minute.
Steve know anyone named Lee Quong?
- Who?
Chinese boy named Lee Quong.
- You ever hear of him?
- No, I haven't.
Hello, Haines? If he starts talking again...
...take down what he says.
We'll be right there.
This Quong was shot down in skid row.
He's been unconscious ever since.
You better come with me.
He keeps babbling about a fellow named Connolly, may be your friend.
Captain.
- Hello, doc.
- I miss anything?
- Just mumbo jumbo.
- What are his chances?
- Don't put a bet on him.
He got two in the back, close up.
- You got the ballistics report?
- No, but I can guess it.
- Can I talk to him?
Go ahead.
Mr. Connolly...
Listen, Quong, which Mr. Connolly?
Do you know Mr. Walsh? Lou Walsh?
Lisa Raidoff?
Mr. Connolly.
Do you know Solly Blayne?
- Mr. Blayne?
- Yes, what about Mr. Blayne?
Mr. Blayne, Mr. Walsh's friend.
But now Mr. Blayne dead.
And nobody know who kill him.
That's why Mr. Connolly come hide in Mr. Walsh's house.
So police don't find out...
...Mr. Walsh owe Mr. Blayne $40,000.
Mr. Walsh make him stay in house all time.
Only Mr. Walsh ever go out.
Five days Mr. Connolly stay.
Ten days.
Me plenty sorry for Mr. Connolly.
Sorry for Miss Lisa too.
Coffee, Steve?
No, thanks.
What's the matter with the cops in this town?
How long are they gonna take to find out who killed Solly?
Maybe they'll never find out.
What's that?
Has it ever occurred to you...
...that perhaps Lou had something to do with it?
Go on.
Why did he want Solly to think that he was in Miami?
Why did he buy this house under another name?
And why does he insist that you stay here, out of sight?
And you think Lou killed him?
Isn't it possible?
It's possible there's 20 guys in this town wanted to bump Solly.
Crooked gambler makes an enemy every time he rakes in a pot.
These cigarettes are beginning to taste like mud.
Well, if you think Lou's innocent...
...what does it matter if the police find out he was in a crooked card game?
What do I do? Forget he gave me a break when I needed one?
Lou helped you because you were valuable to him.
You owe him nothing.
And you are not meant to live in the jungle as he does.
If that's how you feel, what are you doing here?
Didn't you know?
I like it here.
It's gay and exciting.
I have all I ever dreamed of as a girl.
Lou Walsh is my Prince Charming.
This hiding place, my castle.
What more could I ask?
I'm sorry.
I spoke out of turn.
I didn't mean to judge you.
You've been judging me ever since we met.
And I've hated you for it.
Because you were right.
But are you any better?
You wanted to help your friend Bob.
You didn't mind taking a step backward.
Sure, but I knew what I was doing.
I walked in with my eyes open.
And I closed mine. I'd seen too much.
It's no excuse, I know that now.
I was a fool.
One should never close one's eyes.
Why are you telling me this?
Because I'm a coward.
And it's a cheap way to ask for your respect.
You'll be all right.
Lou wants to marry you.
He told me himself.
I won't marry him. I don't love him.
I told him that from the beginning.
He accepted it.
He'll never accept it.
I've seen the way he looks at you.
And you, Steve, why won't you look at me?
Why do we run away from each other?
- What is this? Your 10:00 joke?
- No.
Look at me.
For days now you have seen it in my face.
I know, because you won't look.
Steve, take me away.
Let's both get out of here.
- Stop it, Lisa.
- I can't.
I may never have another chance.
Steve, I love you.
I've never said that to anyone else.
I see Mr. Walsh outside in bushes.
Mr. Walsh look through window at Mr. Connolly and Miss Lisa.
- Steve, where are you going?
- I'm going to tell him about us.
- And the police? What about them?
- Then I go to the police.
- I'll come back here as soon as I can.
- Wait.
- I want to go with you.
- All right. Get your coat.
It's very dark outside, but I see Mr. Walsh.
I see him watch Mr. Connolly get car.
I see him take off brake.
Steve!
Now, I should go to police...
...but maybe Mr. Walsh kill me too if he know I see.
Go now while Mr. Walsh call doctor.
I go back downtown right now.
Mr. Walsh find me.
He kill me too.
Where's the house, Quong?
Mr. Walsh's house?
Canyon.
In canyon.
Canyon? Which canyon?
Laurel? Coldwater?
Benedict Canyon?
Who was the doctor, Quong?
Tell me the name of the doctor.
Can't you help us, doc?
Can't you do something?
I'm afraid the next time he talks, it'll be to his ancestors.
Well, that's that.
Quong have anyone who might tell us where he worked?
We haven't found anybody so far.
We'll start checking the employment agencies.
- You stick around just in case.
- Right.
Thanks, doc. Come on.
What can Garcia do?
There's 20,000 doctors in Los Angeles.
He can't ask each one if they're holding onto their accident reports.
Bob, stop it.
You're just going around in circles.
What I can't understand is why Lou Walsh...
...if he tried to kill Steve, would call a doctor?
Yet Quong said he did call.
That was for Lisa's benefit.
She thought Steve had been in an accident. She told you so.
Why would any doctor protect a crook like Lou Walsh?
Oh, the ones you know wouldn't.
But crooks and gamblers have their own clinics.
- The side door of the Biltmore be okay?
- Yes, fine.
- Promise me you'll go right home to bed.
- Sure, sure, I'll promise.
Blayne.
Blayne.
Your number, please.
- Orick 1-4-4-9.
Hello?
- Mrs. Blayne, this is Julie Benson again.
What was the name of the doctor you called for Solly?
That was Dr. Anstead.
At the Mid-town Professional Building.
Anstead.
Mid-town Professional Building.
Thank you.
Anything wrong, miss?
Dr. Anstead sent me to get some x-rays from his files.
I must have forgotten to get the key.
Could you possibly let me in?
I shouldn't do that without the doctor being here.
It's all right. I'm a registered nurse attending one of Dr. Anstead's patients.
Oh. I guess it's all right.
Thank you.
Ah.
Who's there?
Why, it's me, doctor, Homer, the janitor.
- I didn't know you were here.
- What do you want?
I've done this floor, all excepting your office.
Will you and the nurse be leaving soon?
Nurse?
What nurse? What are you talking about?
A young lady attending one of your patients.
Forgot to get the key from you and asked me to let her in.
When was this?
Just a few moments ago.
Was that all right, doctor?
Oh, yes. Yes, of course.
I didn't understand you at first.
We'll be through in a little while.
You come back later.
Yes, sir.
All right, miss, come out.
I'll take those, miss.
I don't know you.
But you've broken in...
...stolen my records.
I could have you sent to prison.
Then why don't you call the police?
Give me that folder.
As a nurse you must know a doctor's records are confidential.
The doctors I know didn't have to burn theirs.
Where is Steve Connolly?
For the last time, give me that folder.
If I have to take it from you, you may get hurt.
Go ahead, burn them.
That won't help you.
The police know about Steve Connolly, that a doctor's been treating him.
What?
What's that?
They're at the county hospital, with Lou Walsh's houseboy.
When he comes to, he'll tell them where Steve is. They'll find out.
- You're lying.
- Am I?
Call Bob Corey at the Fremont Hotel.
He'll tell you.
Maybe you thought Steve Connolly was in an accident. Well, he wasn't.
Lou tried to kill him.
If he dies, you'll be guilty of murder.
Stop it. Stop it.
Let me think.
Why don't you tell me where he is?
Get in that room.
Get in there.
Do as I tell you.
But I...
Let me speak to Bob Corey, please.
Hello?
Mr. Corey?
- Yeah?
Now, listen very carefully.
I know where your friend Connolly is.
What's that?
I'll tell you how to find him.
But you must protect me, Corey.
- Protect...? Say, who is this?
- I'm his doctor.
I didn't know
Lou Walsh tried to kill him.
We've got to get him to a hospital.
He needs an operation.
But you must protect me, Corey.
You must tell Connolly
I'm the one who saved him.
- Is it a deal?
- Sure, sure. Anything you say.
What do you want me to do?
One thing, Corey, come alone.
Don't tell the police, you've got to promise me that.
Of course I promise.
What's the address?
1121 Canyon Road.
Got that? I'll meet you there.
But remember, Corey, don't tell anyone.
If you try to double-cross me...
...you'll never see your friend again.
Lou. Don't.
Don't, Lou. I had to tell him.
I'm a doctor. I can't stand by and watch that boy die.
Taxi!
Do you know where Canyon Road is?
Canyon Road? Sure. Off Sunset.
Way out towards the beach.
That's where I want to go.
1121 Canyon Road.
- And step on it.
- Okay.
All right for me to start now, doctor?
I can do this room.
Dr. Anstead?
Doctor!
Dr. Anstead.
What's the matter, miss?
I was just talking to him a minute ago.
Operator, get me police headquarters quickly.
- Ben.
- Ben lives over in Glendale, remember?
This is where Lou Walsh lives.
But I...
Why don't you use your head, chum?
You should've known Ben Arno's no guy to settle down as an undertaker.
Ben.
You're Lou Walsh.
That's right.
I don't get it. Why?
Do you know what pushed me into it?
The Bureau of Internal Revenue.
Yeah, taxes.
Ben Arno settles down to being a nice respectable mortician...
...with books the government can audit any day in the year.
But Lou Walsh, he doesn't keep books.
Where's Steve? What have you done?
Relax. Who do you think you're kidding?
- You're not looking for Steve.
- What are you talking about?
Quite a girl, my Lisa, huh?
You saw her once in the hospital.
Yet you've been tearing the town apart every since looking for her.
Beautiful, huh?
Ben, you must be...
You're crazy.
I don't like for you to say that, cowboy.
Like I was gonna tell you...
...you should've stuck to Julie.
You could've had a long and prosperous life.
But you weren't smart enough for that.
You had to go fall for Lisa, the way Steve did.
That time I met him.
I thought to myself, brother, finally one guy I can trust.
That's a laugh for you.
I told him about me being Lou Walsh.
I got him back in the game.
I was putting him on his feet.
What happens?
The minute my back is turned, them two hugging and mugging...
...like a couple of high school kids in the backseat of some jalopy.
Where are they, Ben?
Where are they?
What was it with her?
I gave her clothes.
I bought her this house.
And all I wanted was for her to say just once, "I love you."
Doesn't that kill you?
Me, Ben Arno, begging like some kid, like a cur dog.
Look at her.
My dream girl.
She's a tramp! She couldn't say it.
Not even once.
But you know something...
...I can't help myself.
I keep coming back here, to this house.
I sit in this dark room.
I smell her perfume.
Hear that song.
What did you do with her, Ben?
I never even knew where she went to Christmas Eve.
Not till this morning in Garcia's office.
I thought she'd never get back.
For hours I'd been sitting outside, waiting for her.
'Tis the season to be jolly
Somewhere down the street they were singing Christmas carols.
But I couldn't enjoy it.
I couldn't enjoy anything.
And then she came.
I watched her as she got out and started toward the house.
And then she stopped...
...and looked back at the car.
Her face told me what she was thinking.
She was thinking the brakes were holding.
That Steve hadn't been in any accident after all.
Where have you been?
It's Christmas Eve.
- I thought maybe you and I could...
- It was not an accident, was it?
Somebody took the brakes off.
It was deliberate.
What do you mean?
You told me the brakes slipped.
They couldn't have.
There's nothing wrong with them.
- Where were you when it happened?
- What are you talking about?
You don't think
I had anything to do with it.
You arrived just a few minutes later.
Out of nowhere.
Listen to me, use your head.
If I wanted to kill him, would I take such good care of him?
Anstead's one of the best doctors in town.
You know yourself, I've done everything.
I don't believe you.
- Lisa...
- Let me go.
Lisa, where are you going?
I'm calling an ambulance, take Steve to a hospital.
You heard what Anstead told you, he mustn't be moved.
I don't believe Anstead. He's your doctor.
He says what you tell him.
- Lisa, wait. Let me explain.
- No, Lou, I'm through with you.
I'm going away.
You can't leave.
This is your home.
I bought it for you, remember?
You and me, we're right for each other.
You can't leave.
- Let go.
- No. No.
Can I go now?
Yeah. Go.
Who needs you?
Dames like you are a dime a dozen.
Go on, get out of here! Beat it!
I won't let you go.
I'll never let you go.
- Lou...
- Never.
Tell me you love me.
Don't make me hurt you.
- Tell me you love me.
- Lou!
- Tell me!
- Lou!
Why did she make me do it? Why?
And all the time I kept hearing those Christmas carols.
Why won't she stay dead?
Why does she keep calling me back to this house? This room?
Why won't she let me be?
And Steve, did you kill him too?
Kill Steve? What for?
There'd be no one to talk to about Lisa then.
No.
Steve's upstairs.
Easy.
You don't want to go up there.
You've been a sick boy.
Let me go, Ben.
He's my friend.
And yours too.
Have you forgotten?
He risked his neck for you.
- What do you mean, about Solly?
- Yeah.
Fate conspired against me there, cowboy.
I didn't know Solly went to see Steve.
Not until Solly was dead.
And I took good care of the kid, didn't I? I hid him out here.
Until he double-crossed me.
And even then I didn't let him down.
And since Lisa's gone away,
I fed him with my own hands.
Everything he wants, he has to get from me.
It's kind of a kick, isn't it?
I didn't only break his back, these last 10 days I broke his heart.
He doesn't know about Lisa.
He thinks she walked out on the both of us.
But Lisa's dead and Bonnie's dead, and the doctor's dead.
There's only two people left who can identify Ben Arno as Lou Walsh.
One's Steve and the other's you.
But everybody's gotta die sometime.
It says so in the books.
You'll never get away with it, Ben.
Listen.
That's not the police.
I heard what Anstead said. You came alone.
That's an ambulance, or a fire maybe.
But whatever it is, that's the last sound you'll ever hear.
How do you want it, cowboy?
My buddies.
Why, it's Ben Arno. Hold it, boys.
Let him have it.
Okay, boys, call the coroner.
Captain Garcia, in here, hurry.
Hi, cowboy.
Can I get you anything, Steve?
A cigarette or something?
I could use a couple of miracles, maybe.
- You're going to be all right, Steve.
Sure.
Funny, I feel better already.
Just knowing she didn't run out on me.
It's okay, kids.
We're out of the jungle now.
- Hello, Steve.
- Hey, I thought you stood me up.
- Hop in.
Which way you going?
- Same way you are.
- Hop in.
Know then the legend of the hound of the Baskervilles.
Know then that the great hall of Baskervilles...
was once held by Sir
Hugo of that name...
a wild, profane, and godless man.
An evil man, in truth...
for there was with him a certain ugly and cruel humor...
that made his name a byword in the county.
- Our friend learns swiftly.
- Aye.
He's already learned to fly like a wildfowl... and now he swims like a waterfowl.
Shall we see how he roasts?
Fetch him.
By morning, our friend will know better than to condemn the sport of his master.
Come on out. Come on.
Here he comes, Sir Hugo.
Here he is, Sir Hugo.
Now our waterfowl has become guinea fowl.
Guinea pig, more likely.
Bird or beast, we'll soon make him sing like a nightingale.
Now, sir....
This may teach you to criticize my pleasures.
If 'twere anyone but my own daughter, Master...
You should be proud that a Baskerville... should so much as look at your miserable child.
Pay up!
No, no! The game was spoiled before the wager was laid.
Do not crowd me, sirs, I pray you.
I will not pay.
What about the wager?
If I must, I must.
- But not in gold.
- Not in gold?
In kind, with a plaything
I was keeping for myself.
I accept. Where is the girl?
Girl? What talk is this of a girl?
I know of no girl.
Enough!
You shall see her at once, and before
Sir Richard bursts with passion.
See to it that there be no fighting among your herd of rams.
The bitch has got away.
What does she think I am, that she does this to me?
Damn her!
I have her now.
You there! Let loose the pack!
And you, my hunter at the door...
- ...set the hounds on her.
- But, sir, you cannot...
The hounds! Let loose the pack!
- Yeah, I'll get her.
- My friend, you cannot do this.
I'll get her!
May the hounds of Hell take me if I can't hunt her down!
Come on.
Come on, what's the matter with you? Come on, will you?
Now, you witch!
No.
"And so, the curse of Sir Hugo...
"came upon the Baskervilles...
"in the shape of a hound from Hell...
"forever to bring misfortune...
"to the Baskerville family.
"Therefore, take heed...
"and beware the moor in those dark hours when evil is exalted...
"else you will surely meet the hound of Hell...
"the hound of the Baskervilles.
"So ends the legend."
And what, may I ask, do you think of that, Mr. Holmes?
There must be hundreds of similar folk stories.
I fail to see why I should find this one of singular interest.
What do you say, Watson?
I'm sure Dr. Mortimer's intentions are for the best... but there seems little to be gained from what he's told us.
I had hoped, sir, that the facts
I have laid before you... might have intrigued you as a detective.
I was obviously mistaken.
Good day to you, sir.
Dr. Mortimer, it was something more important... that brought you from
Devonshire to Baker Street... something that occurred on Dartmoor on Friday, the 13th of June.
You've known about it all the time, then?
I know nothing, except that you live on Dartmoor... have a copy of the Devon County
Chronicle in your briefcase... dated June 14.
That newspaper is published on Saturdays, but goes to press on Thursday.
You've kept it for something vitally important.
The headlines aren't interesting, so it must be in the stop press.
Whatever it was happened on
Friday, the 13th of June.
- But this is remarkable.
- Superficial.
There's nothing remarkable about using one's eyes.
Now, sir, would you be prepared to give us the relevant facts?
Why, yes.
Under the circumstances,
I think I would.
- Proceed.
- Thank you.
This is just the stop press.
"Devonshire knight found dead.
"The body of Sir Charles Baskerville discovered on Dartmoor early today.
"Foul play not suspected."
The account in the next edition is much fuller.
Now, where are we?
Yes, here we are.
"The death of Sir Charles Baskerville has caused much sadness...
"in the small village of Grimpen, Dartmoor.
"Dr. Richard Mortimer, a well-known
Devonshire personality...
- "said today that"...
- If you'll pardon me, Dr. Mortimer...
I want just the plain facts in your own words.
Please.
Very well.
The plain facts of the matter are that a fortnight ago...
Sir Charles Baskerville was found dead on the moor.
- Who found him?
- His servant, Barrymore.
He and his wife are housekeepers up at Baskerville Hall.
He fetched me at once and took me back to the body.
Where was the body? Dartmoor, I know, but exactly where? It's a large place.
Near the abbey ruins up on the hill, not far from Baskerville Hall.
The place where Sir Hugo died in the legend... and the circumstances were exactly the same.
You mean Sir Charles had been attacked?
- That his throat had been torn out?
- No. The body was untouched.
But his face....
Never in all my medical career have I seen such a look of horror on a dead person.
Sir Charles must have been terrified when he died.
But he was alone.
The strange thing was, there were no footprints, Mr. Holmes.
That cannot be quite true.
There were the servants', for instance, your own, and Sir Charles'.
Yes, of course, but what
I meant to say was... there were no other footprints.
Facts are only of value when they're clear, concise, and correct.
Pray, continue.
And there was another strange thing.
Sir Charles must've been tiptoeing back to Baskerville Hall when he died.
I could tell that because the footmarks showed only the toes of his boots.
There were no heel marks.
I'm something of an archaeologist in my spare time... and so I'm used to looking for the extraordinary.
You have not yet told us what Sir Charles died of.
Before you do, sir, I suggest it was heart failure.
The inquest found that he died of arteriosclerosis... a disease of the coronary arteries.
A condition of the heart... that can lead to heart failure.
Yes. I think it must be hereditary with the Baskervilles.
They all seem to suffer from the same weakness.
Is there a successor to the family title?
Yes. Sir Henry Baskerville.
He's due to arrive in London tonight from Johannesburg.
Why have you come to me, when you really don't believe... that I can help you?
- I don't think I know what you mean.
- I think you do.
Excuse me.
Although you knew the cause of death, you've implied a more horrible death... that he might have seen the hound of
Hell, the curse of the Baskervilles.
Do you really believe that legend?
There are many things in life and death that we do not understand.
Then I suggest you consult a priest instead of a detective.
Do you think I can influence the powers of darkness?
Of course not.
I thought you might prevent Sir
Henry from going into danger.
If there is an evil curse on the family... it can be just as powerful in London as in Devonshire.
- Where will he be staying?
- At the Northumberland Hotel.
Does this mean that you'll investigate the matter?
I have not said. My commitments are heavy.
I beg of you, Mr. Holmes, this is a matter of life and death.
There can be no harm done by my seeing the man.
Shall we say 10:00 tomorrow morning, at the hotel?
Good. That will suit admirably.
Thank you, Mr. Holmes.
You will not find me ungenerous in the matter of fees.
My professional charges are upon a fixed scale.
I do not vary them, except when I remit them altogether.
Good day.
Good day, Mr. Holmes.
- Thank you, Doctor.
- Not at all, Doctor.
Good day, Dr. Watson.
I must say, you never cease to surprise me, Holmes.
First you tear him apart, and then you say you'll help him.
My dear Watson, you ought to know me better.
I had to burst the balloon, deflate his pomposity... to find one significant clue.
I saw nothing of significance in anything he said.
I'm surprised you bothered with him.
Nevertheless, one important point did emerge.
Didn't you notice anything odd in what he said?
The only thing I noticed was that he said Sir Charles... was tiptoeing about
Dartmoor at night.
That's just it, Watson. Well done, my boy. But he wasn't tiptoeing.
He was running, running for his life... running in panic until he burst his heart.
Would you mind sorting out a large-scale map of Dartmoor... while I find some more tobacco.
This, I think, is a two-pipe problem.
Come in.
So you finally managed to get here.
I didn't know we'd kept you.
Kept me? I sent for you over 20 minutes ago.
- I think perhaps you've made a mistake.
- I've made a mistake, all right.
The mistake I made was in ever coming to this hotel.
What did you find out about my other boot?
They were both here last night.
But nobody knows: the porter, the maid, the boot boy.
Nobody in this hotel of yours knows where the other one's gone to.
You're the manager.
Perhaps you'll tell me what you do with all your boots.
I'm a few minutes late, I'm afraid.
Those confounded horse buses.
However, I see you've all met, we might as well get down to business.
We have not been given an opportunity to introduce ourselves.
I'm so sorry. Please, let me.
Sir Henry, let me introduce
Mr. Sherlock Holmes...
Dr. Watson. Sir Henry Baskerville.
I'm afraid you're a little late, Mortimer.
I've already managed to make quite a fool of myself.
Gentlemen, I must ask you to accept my apologies.
Dr. Watson. Mr. Holmes.
- How do you do?
- Glad to meet you both.
- I'm sorry if I've embarrassed you.
- Say no more.
- It was quite understandable.
- Yes, indeed.
I hope that the missing boot will turn up very soon.
So do I.
I can understand somebody wanting to steal a pair of boots, but one?
There it is.
- Please, sit down, gentlemen.
- Why, thank you.
Now, Mr. Holmes....
Dr. Mortimer has, no doubt, explained why he's asked us to come here.
He has, and I may as well tell you,
I consider him to have been... somewhat hasty in asking your advice.
Surely, it was only to protect your interests.
He has told you of the legend of the hound of the Baskervilles?
Yes, but I don't attach any importance to that sort of old wives' tale.
A man after my own heart.
You intend to go down to Devonshire and live at Baskerville Hall?
I've already come a very long way to do exactly that... and nothing is going to stop me.
- You can understand that, surely.
- I can indeed.
The estate must be worth a vast amount.
Exactly how much, Dr. Mortimer?
You will forgive me if I ask a very personal question?
- Of course.
- Well?
When everything's settled up,
I suppose, close on £1 million.
Did anyone else benefit under Sir Charles' will?
Yes. He left the
Barrymores £1,000... which I thought was rather generous... and I myself received something.
- How much?
- Is this really necessary?
I would not have asked, otherwise.
Very well.
He left me £40,000.
Then, you see, I was Sir
Charles' best friend.
- Were there no other relatives?
- No.
Sir Henry is the last of the Baskervilles.
That's why I'm anxious to safeguard his interests.
Very wise of you.
One thing is certain, Sir Henry.
On no account must you go down to Devonshire alone.
That's taken care of.
Dr. Mortimer's coming with me.
Dr. Mortimer will have his practice to attend to.
I can look after myself, Mr. Holmes.
I must impress upon you that I believe your life to be in considerable danger.
Now, look, if you attach so much importance to this... why don't you come down to
Dartmoor with me today?
- You can pack before the train leaves.
- You're going today?
I can't possibly leave town until the end of the week at least.
- Watson?
- Yeah.
You're free at the moment, aren't you?
Yes, I am... if you think I could do the job.
You're the very man. That's settled.
You'll go down with him.
We'll keep in touch by telegram.
Sir Henry, I am not a man to overestimate danger... but I must insist upon one thing:
Under no circumstances... are you to venture out onto the moor alone at night.
Very well.
As things have gone this far,
I'll do as you say, for now.
But I'm not yet convinced that I need the services... of a detective at all... unless it'd help me find my other boot.
Sir Henry, keep perfectly still... if you value your life.
Move your head. Carefully.
I can't.
You must.
Leave it to me now.
No! Look after him.
Brandy, Mortimer, quickly.
Here you are.
What a filthy thing. Horrible.
You've had a lucky escape... but we must make certain never to be caught off our guard again.
Are you suggesting that that thing was put in there deliberately?
The powers of evil can take many forms.
Remember that, Sir Henry, when you're at Baskerville Hall.
Do as the legend tells... and avoid the moor when the forces of darkness are exalted.
Are you sure you don't want a ride to the village?
Quite sure. It'll only take you out of your way... whereas it's a short walk across the moor.
You'd be better off to go along with us.
Kindly wait until you're spoken to, and get on with what you're doing.
Whatever you say, but don't blame me if you get your throat cut.
- What are you talking about, man?
- There's been an escape.
- An escape? When?
- Night before last. Man named Selden.
Nasty customer, from all accounts.
What's all this about?
Forgive me, Sir Henry, you wouldn't know about it.
One of our largest prisons, called Dartmoor... lies only seven miles across the moor.
It appears that one of the prisoners has broken out.
Selden. Yes, I remember the case.
He murdered a number of street women.
- I thought people hanged for murder here.
- There was some talk of him being insane... so they sentenced him to life imprisonment instead.
Won't do him no good, though, escaping.
He'd only starve himself to death out there, or something worse.
- What do you mean by that?
- Why, nothing, sir.
Just my foolishness.
I feel you should let us take you into the village.
He might be anywhere out there.
Don't worry about me.
I can look after myself.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
All right, Perkins.
A curse upon the family... unhappiness and death to his descendants.
That's what he left, Sir Henry.
Certainly has a lot to answer for.
What about this one here?
That was another picture of Sir Hugo.
It disappeared under mysterious circumstances some months back.
- You mean it was stolen?
- In the middle of the night.
And what steps were taken to recover it?
Your uncle called in the police from
Exeter, but they could find no trace.
One picture of that scoundrel is more than enough.
What do you say, Watson?
Your glass is empty. Please....
You must be bored to tears by all this rigmarole about my family.
- You must think me a terrible host.
- Not at all.
- I've found it extremely interesting.
- Have you?
It's very nice of you to say so.
- Barrymore.
- Sir?
Would you and your good wife care to join me in a toast?
That's most kind of you, Sir Henry.
Let us drink to my first day at Baskerville Hall... and to my firm belief... that the family curse is nothing but a legend... and that the hound of Hell will never again bring fear... to those on the moor at night.
I must ask you to excuse my wife's behavior, Sir Henry.
She was most upset by
Sir Charles' death.
Her nerves have been in a bad way ever since.
I'm very sorry to hear that.
Watson, can you give her something for her nerves?
Yes. Yes, of course. I will.
Barrymore?
Since you've mentioned
Sir Charles' death... perhaps you could tell us a little more about it.
You were the first to discover the body, weren't you?
That's correct.
It was terrible, sir.
I never saw such a dreadful look on anybody's face before.
You found Sir Charles' body up near the old Abbey, I understand.
What made you go up there to look for him?
I didn't, sir.
I was on my way to tell Dr. Mortimer that he was missing, and then I....
Then I saw Sir Charles lying there dead.
But what made you decide to go across the moor to look for Sir Charles?
I've had a look at a map of the locality... and surely it would've been quicker to have taken the trap and gone by road.
There's a shortcut across the moor, sir.
Barrymore... did you go across the moor because you half expected to find Sir Charles... because of the legend?
You know about the legend of the hound of the Baskervilles, don't you?
Do you believe it?
Do you really believe that there is a creature out there?
I don't know what to believe, sir.
What I know is that
I've heard it... heard its terrible howl on the night before Sir Charles died... and I never want to hear such a sound again in all my life.
- Can I help you, sir?
- No, thank you.
It's got away. Damn it. I could've done with that.
Excellent specimen of
Coleoptera scabrus.
I collect them, you know.
- Why, it's Sir Henry.
- It is.
Yeah, the Baskerville mouth. I could have recognized you anywhere... even among the natives.
Frankland is the name.
Frankland, Bishop of the outer isles... for what they're worth.
Very glad to meet you, sir.
Won't you come in?
Thank you.
Yes. How good.
How very good to see a new owner of Baskerville Hall.
That's not quite what I meant....
Poor Sir Charles.
What a splendid fellow he was.
So you knew my uncle?
Knew him? My dear fellow, we were the greatest friends.
How many times Sir Charles and I have discussed life, you know... over a glass of sherry.
In that case, perhaps you'd care to join me in a glass of sherry now.
Now you've mentioned sherry...
I think perhaps I might like a glass.
I saw Bishop Frankland coming up the drive, Sir Henry.
Barrymore... still the faithful retainer.
Thank you.
- For you, Sir Henry?
- No, thank you, Barrymore.
"That's the best sherry in Devon," I always say.
Sir Charles knew his creature comforts, all right.
Seen him with some very attractive creatures at times.
Yes, he knew a woman when he saw one, did Sir Charles.
Yes. Poor fellow.
May he rest in peace.
What a loss.
Thank you. I think I should like another glass, yes.
Watson, I don't think you've met the Bishop.
- Bishop Frankland, Dr. Watson.
- How do you do?
Watson, you say the name is?
Yes, I knew a Watson in Caprina.
Yes, a notorious white slaver. Nice fellow, though. Relation of yours?
No, sir. Not that I know of.
But, of course, it is possible.
You've come to approve the new
Lord of the manor I imagine?
- It's not necessary.
- Thank you.
But why have I come?
- Yes, of course. The jumble sale.
- Jumble sale? What on earth's that?
It's a colloquial expression,
Sir Henry. A sale of oddments.
And I was wondering if you had anything you could spare for us.
An odd tablecloth or an old suit or some cast-off silver?
I'm sure I can.
I'll ask Mrs. Barrymore.
That's very kind of you.
May I give you the address in which you could have them sent?
I'm sure we shall all be very grateful to you... very grateful, indeed, if you'd have them sent there.
Now, I shan't apologize for the tract.
It's really rather charming.
"All things bright and beautiful."
Thank you.
I'm just going down to the village to leave instructions at the post office.
If you'll excuse me, my Lord Bishop.
Of course. I'd give you a lift on the tricycle but I wanted to chat with Sir Henry.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
I'm afraid you'll be expected to open the sale, Sir Henry... and judge the prettiest mother and baby.
Do you know, dear old Sir
Charles, he loved doing that?
Yeah. He did, indeed.
I remember one occasion when one of the babies wet....
Dear.
Don't move. Stay where you are.
I said not to move, sir.
You've no call to use that kind of trap. It's unnecessarily cruel.
A man's got to live.
There are ways of killing animals without torturing them.
Why don't you use a gun?
- I'm sorry.
- Besides, cartridges cost money.
Some of us haven't got any to spend.
It's a poor life on the moor, Sir Henry.
I'm afraid you've made a mistake.
My name is Watson... though I'm staying at Baskerville Hall.
- With Sir Henry?
- Yes.
Tell the new squire his new neighbor would like to meet him.
I farm the lower pastures near the hall.
Have done for nearly a year.
Poor land it is, too.
- What name is it?
- Stapleton.
Very well. I'll tell Sir Henry.
I wonder, could you tell me how to get to Baskerville Hall?
- I seem to have lost my way.
- You'll bear right at the fork.
Thank you.
Mr. Watson....
Don't step off the track or you'll find yourself in Grimpen Mire.
Once in there, you'll never get out.
Thank you.
Good morning.
I wonder, could you tell me, am I on the right path to Baskerville Hall?
The track seems to end here.
Watch out!
The mire!
I say!
Cecile, come back!
Hold on.
You wait, my girl, I'll teach you to come when I call.
Get the cart down as near here as you can.
Be quick about it. Will you do as you're told, girl?
I told you to watch out.
- Who is that girl?
- My daughter.
The moor's no place for a girl.
- What was she frightened of?
- There's a convict escaped from the prison.
I'll help you to the cart.
Watch where I step.
Thank you.
Now that you're here, would you like to come in and see Sir Henry?
- It's as good a time as any.
- How about Miss Stapleton?
- Would she like to come in, too?
- She'll wait where she is.
Very well.
Well, good morning, Miss Stapleton.
Hello.
If you're looking for the new owner, he's not at home.
Go away.
I haven't introduced myself yet.
I'm Henry Baskerville.
- May I ask...
- Please, go away.
My father will be out in a moment.
So your father's gone into the hall?
- Let's join him.
- No. Don't.
Here. You wait a minute.
- Leave me alone!
- Just a minute! Calm down!
Now, why did you run away?
Why did you run away?
I've done nothing to frighten you.
- My father.
- What about your father?
- He would have seen us.
- What of it?
Now, would you let me go?
Cecile!
Where have you been?
Come on, girl. Where have you been?
- Good morning.
- Morning.
- Sir Henry Baskerville, isn't it?
- Yes.
I've been looking forward to meeting you.
My name is Stapleton.
Welcome to Dartmoor.
- You're very kind.
- I run the home farm.
You'll be very welcome whenever you're that way.
We must be getting on our way, mustn't we, Cecile?
- Good day to you, sir.
- Good day.
Come on!
Watson, here.
Move the candle about. Quickly.
I swear I saw a light out there on the moor as soon as you picked up the candle.
Someone out there is signaling to the house. Come.
Whatever happens, Sir Henry, you must stay with me.
- We're still in line with the light.
- Yes, but we're not near enough yet.
Keep close to me. Don't go off left, or you'll be in Grimpen Mire.
Right?
Come on.
Come out! We're armed!
They've gone.
Whoever they are, they must have heard us.
Watson!
Come on! There's still a chance.
No, no. Quiet. Listen.
He's down there somewhere.
What was that, Watson?
What was that?
It's my heart.
Drink some of this.
Will you be able to get back if I help you?
I'll try.
Come on, then.
That is for me to decide, Sir Henry.
I suggest that you have a little rest.
- Good night.
- Good night.
I really don't know why you bothered to send for me.
After all, as a doctor, you're just as capable as I am.
Does your diagnosis confirm mine?
He has a similar heart condition to his uncle, agreed.
Hereditary, no doubt, but nowhere near so far advanced.
All the same, I'd like to leave him in your charge until I get back.
If you insist.
Anyway, my night's sleep is ruined, but
I really can't see that it's necessary.
Nevertheless, I'd appreciate it if you would stay.
It's essential that I go back to the moor.
All right. I'll stay.
Why have you left Sir Henry alone?
Holmes.
I repeat, why have you left Sir Henry alone?
Dr. Mortimer is with him.
- Anyone else?
- Yes. The Barrymores.
Very well, then.
Forgive me if my dramatic entrance startled you.
It's good to see you again.
It's been rather lonely up here.
This is fantastic.
How long have you been in Devon?
Four hours and 52 minutes less than you.
I caught the next train down after yours.
But your telegram...
I wrote that before I left town and had it delivered later.
So it was you I saw.
You might have let me know what you intended to do.
I'm sorry, but I didn't want it known I was here.
You would have tried to prevent me.
- You will understand, I had to find Selden.
- Selden, the convict?
- That was madness.
- No doubt, but effectual.
- How did you know he was on the moor?
- I read about it in the newspapers.
The escape was well-reported.
I'm surprised you didn't notice it.
He told me all he had seen since he's been hiding.
What had he seen?
What did he tell you?
There is more evil around us here than I have ever encountered before.
I still don't see...
Mortimer's gone.
His ponycart's not there.
- You told him to stay with Sir Henry?
- Indeed, I did.
Which way? For heaven's sake, which way?
Too late.
- We're too late.
- Sir Henry.
Watch out, Holmes.
It's treacherous here.
We must go back and get help, then come back for the body.
I'm to blame for this.
- I shall never forgive myself.
- I warned him.
What could have possessed him to come out alone on the moor?
The last of the Baskervilles.
His life was in our hands.
I shall not rest until I destroy the thing that killed him.
- You're Barrymore, I take it.
- Yes, sir.
Barrymore, I want you to get a ladder, some rope, and lanterns... and load them on the cart within five minutes.
You understand?
- Yes, sir.
- Good.
- Where's your room?
- This way. I'll show you.
And have those attended to, will you?
Very good, sir.
I'll need a pair of dry stud boots and a heavy coat before we go out again.
Yes, of course.
You know, Holmes, I can't help feeling that if I hadn't left Sir Henry alone...
We're to avenge his death, not mourn over it.
No. This way.
Who's there?
Holmes. For heaven's sake, when did you get here?
I am glad to see you again.
I am more than glad to see you, Sir Henry.
Who was it, Holmes?
Who was the poor devil that died instead of me?
If my deductions are correct, it was the convict, Selden.
He was a murderer, I know, but he shouldn't have died that way.
But why him? The curse is only on the Baskervilles. Is no one safe?
Selden had on the suit you were wearing when we met in London.
- How did he get them?
- He must've broken in and stolen them.
Possibly, but unlikely.
Sir Henry... why did Dr. Mortimer leave so suddenly tonight?
He told me that he'd stay until I got back.
Stupid row, really.
He kept on about my uncle's death and the curse on the family, and...
I asked if he was trying to frighten me and told him to mind his business.
I should like a few words with Dr. Mortimer sometime.
Excuse me, Sir Henry. Is there anything else you require?
No, thank you, Barrymore, not as far as I'm concerned.
- You've prepared a room for Mr. Holmes?
- Yes, sir.
Will you still be needing the ladder and rope you asked for tonight, sir?
No. Not now.
But I shall want them and your help in the morning.
Very good, sir.
- Barrymore.
- Sir?
That room at the end of the corridor upstairs:
Has it been used lately?
- Not for some time, sir.
- I see.
I think you'll find a candle burning near the window in that room.
Do kindly extinguish it. It's serving no useful purpose.
- Very good, sir.
- Thank you.
And now, with your permission, to bed.
Yes. We could all do with a good night's sleep.
This, I perceive, is Sir Hugo Baskerville, the man who started all the trouble.
Yes, it is. How the devil did you know?
Family likeness. There are certain features that are unmistakable.
What happened to the picture that hung here?
That one? Nobody knows.
It disappeared some time ago.
Yes.
Yes, of course. It had to.
Stupid of me.
Yes. Good night.
That's strange. There's nothing there.
I could have sworn that that was the spot.
It must be more over this way.
No, Watson. You were right.
This was the place. Look at this.
Here's another trace... and another.
You can see where they're leading to.
- Barrymore!
- Sir?
Tell Perkins to bring the cart up to the ruins, then follow us.
- Yes, sir.
- We won't find the body down here.
By heavens, what's been going on here?
The Baskerville crest, engraved on the hilt.
Mr. Holmes!
As I thought. Selden.
His body's been mutilated.
Some revolting sacrificial rite has been performed.
- What depths a human being can sink to.
- What human being could have done this?
That is precisely what
I intend to find out.
- You rang for me, sir?
- I did, Mrs. Barrymore. Sit down, please.
- No, thank you, sir. I prefer to stand.
- As you wish.
I want to ask you and your husband a few questions, if you don't mind.
- How long have you been married?
- Married?
- Must be almost five years now, isn't it?
- Is that right, Miss Selden?
Yes, sir. We got married about...
Please, sit down.
Your name was Selden before you married, wasn't it?
And the convict who escaped was your brother?
- How did you know?
- Your brother told me.
- He's dead, sir, isn't he?
- Yes, I'm afraid he is.
How did it happen?
You gave Selden some of Sir
Henry's clothes, didn't you?
Well, I....
Someone, or something... mistook your brother for Sir Henry.
You mustn't blame my husband, sir.
I gave him the clothes.
Sir Henry said I might take them for the village sale.
Buy why should they have them... when my brother was out on the moor, cold and hungry?
Thank you, sir.
I know he was bad, sir, but he was ill, really... and he was my brother.
You can't leave someone you love out there, cold and starving.
I understand. It might help you to know he also told me... he would never let them recapture him alive.
Come along, my dear.
Poor woman.
I suppose when Sir Henry and
I arrived here at the hall... she found it difficult to get food to her brother.
They arranged a signal with the candle at the window... to show him the coast was clear.
Couldn't they be charged with helping an escaped convict?
They could, but they won't.
I've satisfied the local police.
What's the next move?
"All things bright and beautiful, all creatures great and small."
I wonder if that includes tarantulas.
Tarantulas?
But, Holmes....
- A gentlemen to see you, my lord.
- Good, good. Just in time.
Yes, I'm still having trouble with it.
Will you come and have a look at it?
Of course, I'm not an engineering man, but it seems this eccentric is malaligned.
Or perhaps if this cam were buffed to another thou or so... it might make all the difference, don't you think?
- Or perhaps a shim.
- Graphite grease.
What?
Of course, yes. I have got some.
- Do you know, I never thought of it?
- Allow me.
Thank you.
Yes. Silly of me.
- Yes.
- Thank you.
There you are.
You'll want that. Yeah.
Now let's see.
Wonderful, wonderful.
That's done the trick, yeah.
I wish Mrs. Goodliffe would leave those windows alone.
Never mind. Take a glass of sherry before you go.
- Bishop Frankland, I...
- Nonsense.
A little wine, for your stomach's sake. That's in the Bible.
I think you'll like this.
What do I owe you for your trouble, and your fare from Exeter, of course?
My Lord, you've mistaken me for someone else.
No. Only somebody from
Warburton and Crawley... could have solved that problem.
Nevertheless, I am not from
Warburton and Crawley.
- Not?
- My name is Sherlock Holmes.
I am staying with Sir
Henry Baskerville.
Allow me to shake the hand of the country's greatest detective.
That case of the Bermondsey forgery, that was first class.
Thank you. And I am pleased to meet our most distinguished entomologist.
You've heard of me? How flattering.
I know the directors of the Regents Zoo... regard you as the highest living authority on the study of rare spiders.
Spiders?
It is about that subject that I have come to see you.
- The species of the genus Theraphosa.
- Tarantula.
Everybody's asking me about tarantulas these days.
No.
I'm afraid I can't help you on that subject.
How very disappointing... because I've found one.
- Found one? Have you, by Jove?
- Dead, fortunately.
Pity. Never mind.
Where did you find it, somewhere about the village?
- No. In London.
- Up there.
Nevertheless... it was the same spider that you lost.
No, impossible. Far too far away.
Are you suggesting that
I've lost a spider?
I'm afraid I am.
You have, haven't you?
You lost a spider sent to you from the London Zoo about five days ago.
- Are you interested in butterflies?
- My Lord, I must insist.
Will it help if I tell you I am fighting evil, fighting it as surely as you do?
Yes. Very well. I did lose a tarantula.
I missed it last Thursday. I've been worried out of my life ever since.
They're dangerous.
So I understand. But you needn't worry any longer. The spider is dead.
Now, it is important that you answer this question correctly.
What visitors did you have on the day you missed the tarantula?
Visitors?
That's difficult because
Thursday's my at-home day.
I mean, a lot of people like to look in for sherry and a chat.
Let me see. There was old Mrs. Smythe.
Poor woman. Drinks.
Yes. Dr. Mortimer before lunch.
Dear old Mortimer. How he talks.
The Stapletons to tea.
The man about the woodworm in the belfry.
Fascinating little creatures. But the church is full of them, you know?
I'm extremely sorry to hear that.
And the man's name?
- Smith, I think.
- And no one else?
Last Thursday? No.
Thank you, my Lord, that is all I wish to know.
It has been most kind of you and most helpful.
And thank you for helping me with my telescope.
- Not at all.
- Remarkable instrument.
It's surprising what you can see through a good telescope.
Now, what's going on in the big world?
There's Sir Henry.
Where's he off to?
Dear me, this is very interesting.
Come have a look.
Come here. Come have a look.
He's gone.
Anybody at home?
Mr. Stapleton?
Why did you come here?
I'm sorry. You must think me very rude, but I did knock.
I've come to see your father.
He's not here. He's gone to Baskerville Hall.
Has he? May I ask why?
To invite you and your friends to dinner tonight.
That's very kind of him.
Would you like some cider?
Thank you very much. I would.
What time are we expected to arrive?
You mean, you will come?
I'm looking forward to it.
It won't be like Baskerville Hall.
I haven't spent all my life at Baskerville Hall, Cecile.
- I like your home.
- This is not my home.
My home is in Spain.
You were looking at the picture of my parents.
My mother was a fine woman... a fine Spanish woman.
She would hear nothing of living in England.
She was born in Spain, and there she would die, she said.
She did die.
We came here to England.
My father spent all the money we had saved... to come back to England to become a gentleman farmer in his own country.
But the land he bought is no good.
The money's gone.
We have a saying at home:
"Weeds are not killed by the frost."
We still live.
- Have you ever thought of going back?
- I've thought of nothing else.
My father's too proud to admit he's beaten.
Proud of this.
And so we are left with the moor and the mist.
- You must be very lonely.
- Yes, I am very lonely.
When you are poor, no one wants to know you.
I want to know you, Cecile.
Why did you run away from me yesterday, when we'd hardly met?
Why did you kiss me, Cecile?
Why?
I don't know.
- Tell me.
- I don't know.
Will you meet me tonight at the hall?
We can walk back across the moor.
If you want me to.
Our paths seem to have crossed this morning, Sir Henry.
I suppose you've come to talk about the farm.
You have cider? Good. Cecile, fetch another tankard for me.
Now, quickly about it, girl.
Do sit down, Sir Henry.
Thank you.
I was wondering if you and your guests would care to join us for a meal tonight?
- Just simple fare, of course.
- Yes, so your daughter's already told me.
I'd be very pleased to. So will
Mr. Holmes and Dr. Watson.
Good. It will be a change for us to have visitors.
To your health, sir.
But how can you be so certain that someone took one of the bishop's spiders... and deliberately placed it in Sir Henry's room... that it wasn't in his luggage from South Africa?
Elementary, my dear Watson. There are no tarantulas in South Africa.
Whoever placed it there didn't know that.
Precisely.
But he did know when and where
Sir Henry was arriving... and where he'd be staying.
He also knew a great deal about the Baskerville family.
A bite from a tarantula is not necessarily deadly to a healthy man... but to a man with a weak heart....
That points to somebody from this part of the country.
Why not?
There's an fine train service to and from London... and as Sir Charles died here only a month ago... it's less suspicious for Sir
Henry to die in London.
Sir Charles, I'd almost forgotten about him.
- It's a good thing I remembered, wasn't it?
- All right.
But the person who benefited most from his will was Sir Henry.
You're not going to suggest that he killed his uncle?
£1 million is a great temptation.
In a case such as this, everyone is suspect, even Sir Henry.
Dr. Mortimer was the only one who knew where Sir Henry would be in London... and when he was arriving.
No. No. The London Times would have published it.
What about the legend of the hound of Hell?
Remember, we've both seen something of its horror.
Watson! You inspire me!
Let me see your map, quickly.
Selden swore he heard his cries coming from the very depths of the Earth.
The hound of Hell. Let me see.
Really, I must pull myself together.
I should have noticed this long ago.
Holmes. Barrymore told me you'd arrived.
And about time, too, if I may say so... considering what happened to that convict fellow last night.
A development I deeply regret, Dr. Mortimer.
I don't.
A man like that deserves all he gets.
In case you're both wondering why I'm here...
I've just come over to start looking through the family estate.
I think I'm wasting my time, if you ask me.
You know, really, Holmes...
I find it quite impossible to get on with Sir Henry.
I understand you had a disagreement with him last night.
Disagreement?
He was downright rude, if that's what you mean.
Hardly an excuse to leave him alone when you know he's in danger.
You told me you'd stay with
Sir Henry until I got back.
What if I did?
I don't see why I should be insulted by the man I'm trying to protect.
After all, I only mentioned the subject of the legend.
Now, you are very fond of doing that, Dr. Mortimer. Why?
Weren't you the first to discover the existence of the legend?
Mr. Holmes... when I engaged you...
I looked to you to protect
Sir Henry's interests.
I'm beginning to see, for the first time in my life, I was wrong in my judgment.
- If you care to relinquish the case...
- I never relinquish!
- Mr. Holmes...
- Please, don't let us fall out at this stage.
I need your help, unfortunately.
You know a lot about the geography and history of this district, I believe.
I am considered something of an authority.
There's an old tin mine marked here on the map.
- Does it still exist?
- I believe so.
What of it? It's been derelict for years.
Yes, I rather fear this map a wee out of date.
Could you show me the way to the entrance?
What on earth for?
Could you?
I'm afraid not.
I haven't been near there for years.
Perhaps Stapleton can help you.
It lies under his ground.
If he agreed to show me, would you come with us?
I suggest that you stay away from the mine, Mr. Holmes.
It hasn't been in use for a long time, the shaft is in a dangerous condition.
How do you know, if you haven't been there for years?
It's obvious, isn't it?
Any tunneling is dangerous if it isn't in a state of repair.
Still, I feel I must take a look at it. Will you come with me?
As an archeologist, your help will be invaluable.
I suppose, if you're going to make an issue of it, I shall have to come.
- Good. Good man.
- What do you want me to do?
Identify anything I may find.
Strange things are to be found on the moor.
Like this, for instance!
- Where did you find that?
- Interesting, isn't it?
Could you tell me how old it is?
I'm not sure.
- About 1700, I imagine.
- 1740, to be exact.
And the blood, how old is that?
I couldn't tell.
Then I will tell you. It is less than 10 hours old.
Could you tell me anything else about the weapon?
No? Come, come.
With your knowledge of the legend,
I made certain you ought to know.
It's the dagger Sir Hugo used to murder the girl in the abbey.
And more recently, it has been used for some diabolical ceremony.
All right, Watson, we're all down quite safely.
Good! I'll be waiting for you here!
I don't expect we shall be very long.
You'd both better follow close behind me for the moment.
You'll have to watch your step.
It's very slippery down here.
The water seeps through from the mire.
Don't touch any of the props, whatever you do!
We'll have the whole roof down on us.
We should never have come down here. It's far too dangerous.
What do you expect to find, Mr. Holmes?
What is one likely to find under the ground?
Bones, perhaps.
This is dangerous.
You carry on, Mr. Holmes, while we chock the wheels.
- Certainly.
- Here you are.
Thank you.
We won't need to go any further.
I've found what I came down for.
No good, Watson?
Leave the lanterns there, Mr. Stapleton.
We must go to the village and get some help.
I'm afraid it won't do no good, sir.
Must be a ton of rock blocking that shaft there.
We must try.
You must resign yourself to the fact that there's no hope of him being alive.
- Don't you agree, Stapleton?
- You know as much about it as I do.
It's over two hours since the roof fell.
You've been down there.
We've heard nothing.
Not likely to, with all that rock in front of us.
That don't mean to say he's not alive.
Plenty of air in that old mine. Comes in from them ventilating shafts.
Couldn't we get down one of them and find him that way?
I wouldn't like to say, sir.
I doubt there's a man as knows them entrances.
We must try to find one.
Mr. Stapleton, will you lead us back to the path immediately, please?
I did warn him not to go.
You were there. You heard me, didn't you?
- There's still a chance.
- A very good chance.
I've been waiting for you for the last 10 minutes.
Holmes!
- Thank heaven you're safe.
- How did you get out? This is wonderful.
That's gratifying.
When the applause has died down,
I wonder if we could get back to the hall.
I've hurt my leg, I'm cold, and I'm hungry.
Will you please stop behaving like a maiden aunt.
If I hadn't known there were a number of entrances to the mine...
- ...I'd never have gone down.
- But for a wretched old beef bone...
It is not a wretched old beef bone.
That's just the point.
It's a relatively new one.
- But I...
- No buts.
Would you mind, please, passing me my tobacco?
- Where is it?
- You'll find it in the top right-hand drawer.
An unopened tin.
- You must have put it somewhere else.
- The right-hand top drawer.
- I'm looking in the right-hand top drawer.
- Isn't it there?
I've just told you it isn't there.
Here it is.
Just a minute. I know I put it there this morning.
Watson, the bottom drawer, where I put the dagger... is it still locked?
No.
Holmes, the lock's been forced!
The dagger's not there.
Watson.
How's the leg feeling now?
- Not very good.
- I'm sorry to hear that.
I wasn't able to tell you before... but Stapleton has asked us over for a meal tonight.
- Has he?
- Yes. I thought it was a very nice gesture.
Still, I don't suppose you'll feel like going with your leg the way it is.
No, I don't.
They'll be very disappointed, and
Cecile is waiting for me downstairs.
Of course, I wouldn't dream of going without you.
My dear Sir Henry, if you'd wanted us to come with you... you'd have told us about the invitation much sooner than this.
I beg your pardon?
You'd better be off. You mustn't be late for your peasant friends.
- I don't like that, Holmes.
- I don't like the people you're mixing with.
I thought, in your new position, you would've cultivated worthier friends.
I hope you enjoy their rabbit pie.
Mr. Holmes, I appreciate the fact that you are here to help me.
Nevertheless, I would remind you that you are also a guest in my house.
- Good night!
- Good night.
- I do think you might...
- Do stop talking nonsense.
You know my methods.
Couldn't you see I was being purposely rude?
I wanted him to go without us.
The dagger's gone.
Don't you realize what that means?
Sir Henry is to die tonight!
Are you sure your leg is all right?
It's got to be, if we're to break the curse he laid on the Baskervilles.
- Holmes?
- Yes.
You learned something from that portrait that I never saw.
The hands, Watson. Why do you think this painting was stolen?
Because the artist revealed both hands.
Barrymore's confirmed what I suspected.
The fingers of Sir Hugo's right hand were webbed.
- Stapleton.
- Exactly. Stapleton.
Illegitimate descendent of Sir Hugo, next in line to the Baskerville fortune.
- No. This way.
- But this is the way to the farm.
Come on.
Swine!
You thought it was going to be easy, didn't you? Didn't you?
You won't be the first of your family who thought that... and you won't be the first to die because of it.
Remember the legend?
Sir Hugo died here.
His throat was torn out because of a girl.
And Sir Charles, your dear uncle, he died here, didn't he?
Died because he wanted me, like you.
Died because he wanted a woman enough to bring me here alone at night... in spite of the hound of the Baskervilles.
He died screaming.
I know. I watched him.
And now you are here alone... at night.
You don't understand, do you?
Then let me explain.
I, too, am a Baskerville, descended from Sir Hugo... descended from those who died in poverty while you scum ruled the moor.
We have waited and prayed for this moment, my father and I.
Now our time has come, and yours.
The curse of the hound is on you.
No, Watson! She won't get far.
Attend to Sir Henry.
All right.
All right, Sir Henry.
The hound is dead, and you must see it, sir.
No, I don't....
It is best that you should.
There is nothing to fear now.
There's a passage leading from the mine to this place.
I discovered it after Stapleton tried to kill me down there.
They used this mask to make it look more terrifying.
He was starved for weeks, kept in the mine till the time was ripe... then given the scent.
They had to have something of yours to give the hound.
We'd better get Sir Henry back to Baskerville Hall.
Have you got your cape?
Would you get it for me?
- So the curse has claimed its last victim.
- Yes.
No more will be heard of the hound of the Baskervilles.
I feel I have already suffered enough from my infamous ancestor... and so....
"And so I am sending you the missing portrait...
"which we found at Stapleton's farm to add to your collection of souvenirs.
"I hope you will accept it, also the check which I enclose for..."
Very generous.
After tea, you must write to Sir
Henry that I should be pleased... to accept both his gifts.
Tell me, Holmes... when did you first suspect the truth about this case?
- The truth?
- Yes, that the hound was a real dog... and not just a legendary myth.
When Sir Henry complained of a missing boot... that put me on the scent, as it were.
As early as that.
That's incredible.
It's elementary, my dear Watson.
A muffin?
Thank you.
[Woman Narrating] This is San Francisco as it looks from Telegraph Hill.
And this is the house on Telegraph Hill...
where I once thought I would find peace and contentment.
This is how it looks today, but my story begins 11 years ago...
and 7,000 miles away in another house near Warsaw...
in my native Poland.
My name is Victoria Kowelska...
and this was my home.
It looked like this in 1939 when my husband came home on leave.
And this is what was left after the Germans had passed.
In one stroke,
I had lost my husband...
my home, everything I held dear...
and had become one of the thousands of miserable strays...
who were herded into prisons and concentration camps.
- [Shouts In German]
- How the will to live survives in a place like Belsen...
I do not know.
But I wanted to live.
I was determined to...
and I was just as determined that my friend Karin Dernakova should live too.
I had met Karin, a fellow countrywoman, in the camp.
But she was sick and frail- too frail for the life of that camp.
And she had more to live for than most of us.
Her infant son had been smuggled out of Poland just before the war...
to an aunt in San Francisco.
And if she ever lived through this, she would join them.
Just think, Vicki.
He's talking and walking by now.
And if he would see me... he wouldn't even know me.
Please, Karin, you must eat.
You must keep up your strength.
What's the use, Vicki?
We'll never get out of here.
I'll never see my Christopher again.
Hey! Let go!
You dirty hypocrite! You don't care about her any more than I do!
You only stick to her like a leech because she has rich relatives in America.
Oh! Oh!
Don't think she's going to take care of you when we get out of here.
- Don't listen to her.
- She'll never get out of here alive!
None of us will ever get out of here alive!
We are going to get out.
We are.
Eat your food.
You will come to America with me, Vicki, won't you?
Aunt Sophie has a big house on the hill.
She lives there alone with my Christopher.
She will be glad if I bring you, because you've helped me so much.
Oh, Karin.
[Victoria Narrating]
Karin was my friend...
[Victoria Narrating]
Karin was my friend...
and I fought for her survival as I fought for my own.
But in the end, I was beaten.
I had done everything I could for her.
I stole food, medicine...
and I fought off the others.
I had tried to keep her mind filled only with thoughts of her son and her aunt.
But with the German army on the run and liberation only days away...
Karin Dernakova and our dreams of America...
lay on the cold floor of Belsen.
All of Karin's identification was in that bundle.
Her aunt had not seen her since she was a little girl.
I knew as much about
Karin's life as about my own.
Why not?
Why shouldn't I be Karin Dernakova?
Three days later,
I came before the liberators.
[German]
[German]
[Man #2 Speaking German]
Karin Dernakova.
[German]
[Man #1]
She's scared to death.
Tell her we're her friends- that we wanna help her find her home, her family.
Yes, sir.
[German]
[Sobbing]
Get some water.
Here. Drink.
Tell her not to be afraid- that nobody's gonna hurt her.
[Speaking German]
There. That's better.
- I'm all right now.
- You speak English.
A little.
I learned it at school.
I am sorry to make you all this trouble.
You make us all the trouble you want.
Yell if you'd like to.
You're entitled to it.
Some more of the same stuff, sir.
- You're from Warsaw?
- Yes.
Well, you'll wanna go back home as soon as possible, I suppose?
I have no home.
It was destroyed.
No, I meant, back to your family.
No family left in Poland.
- My-My parents were killed.
My husband also.
- I'm sorry.
In other words, you don't wanna be repatriated.
Oh, no! Poland does not exist anymore for me.
- If you force me to go back-
- We're here to help people... not to force anybody to do anything.
I feel I should explain, though, that the alternative is a camp for displaced persons.
I'm afraid that isn't a permanent solution either.
Do you have any idea what you would like to do?
Oh, I- I will take care of myself somehow.
I guess that's all for now.
Thank you, Major.
You're very kind.
Just a minute.
This must have fallen out of your bundle.
It belongs to a Victoria Kowelska.
Who is she?
- She's dead.
- How do you happen to have this?
She was my friend.
We kept our things together.
She will not need this... anymore.
[Victoria Narrating]
So now for better or for worse...
I was Karin Dernakova.
I was soon transferred to a displaced persons camp.
The moment I arrived there, I sent a cable to Aunt Sophie in America...
and signed Karin's name to it.
and signed Karin's name to it.
The answer came in a few days.
- Karin Dernakova.
- Dernakova?
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, yes.
Here it is. Just came across from the message center.
I'll read it for you.
"Your cable address to Mrs. John Albertson forwarded to us.
- Advise: addressee deceased."
- Please?
Deceased.
It means the person's dead.
"Exhaustive search revealed all known relatives abroad dead.
"Address all further communications to our eastern representative...
"Joseph C. Callahan, Attorney,
New York City.
"Signed, Bennett,
Compton and Maxwell... attorneys for the Albertson estate."
I'll make a copy for you.
[Narrating]
And that was my answer-
a cable from an unknown lawyer in the unattainable city of New York.
And my hopes gone with that cable.
In that moment,
I nearly gave up.
But I'd lived with my dream too long...
and the idea of getting to America had become an obsession.
When the day finally came for me to join hundreds of others...
and go aboard the United Nations refugee ship...
we could hardly believe it.
We had spent the four long years since the end of the war...
in waiting, hoping and praying.
Now we were actually sailing, and we moved doubtfully...
fearful that at the last moment, we might be snatched back.
But on that day in 1950...
when I reached New York and found my way to the office of the lawyer...
who had sent me the cable...
I knew that I would never let anything send me back.
Mrs. Dernakova, when you gave up your child almost nine years ago-
I did not give him up.
He was sent to America to save his life.
Nevertheless, the fact remains... that others, not you, have taken care of the boy since he was an infant.
It wasn't my fault that I wasn't able to come here years ago to take care of him.
You know, of course, that after
Mrs. Albertson's death...
Mr. Spender adopted the boy.
But he had no right to do that while the child's mother was still alive.
We had every reason to believe that you were dead.
- All the reports indicated it.
- As a matter of fact, there is still some doubt that-
But you've seen my papers!
What more proof do you want?
My dear madame, you must realize... that there is a considerable fortune involved here.
I think you are the one who realizes it more than I.
Mrs. Dernakova, the law is on our side.
Your aunt- I mean, the late Mrs. Albertson- left the estate to the boy with Mr. Spender as guardian.
It is true that the law, as you say, is on your side.
I am in a strange country, and I'm alone.
But I have a feeling that here, in some way, I will find justice.
I don't care how long it takes.
I will fight for what belongs to me.
And I will never let you keep my son from me!
I, uh, think you're being hasty.
We might be prepared to settle this on some reasonable basis.
Just a minute, Callahan.
- Mrs. Dernakova?
- Yes?
I'm sorry to have put you through this ordeal... but, you see,
I had to be positive.
I'm sure you'll agree there's Chris to consider too.
And if we both started there, unselfishly... we might find some solution to this problem... without lawyers.
What's the matter?
Don't you like our food?
Oh, yes.
But I'm still upset.
Your lawyer's so very efficient.
Oh, forget about him.
Let's talk about you.
I didn't know I had such a beautiful relative in Poland.
What?
Don't look so surprised. Aunt Sophie was related to me, too, by marriage.
Oh.
If she were alive,
I would have been with her long ago.
- I sent her a cable.
- Yes, I know.
You know?
Well, look.
Let me explain.
You and your husband had been reported dead years before.
My lawyer was convinced we were dealing with an impostor.
We never heard from you again, and that only served to confirm our original suspicions.
If only you'd tried again- written or wired or anything.
Well, I- I didn't know what to do, where to turn.
I- I felt so lost.
Well, you've gotta forget all that now... and think of the future... and Chris.
- You'll be proud of him.
- Tell me about him.
What does he look like?
- You'll be proud of him.
- Tell me about him.
What does he look like?
Well, he's a very good-looking boy, I think.
He- He resembles you in some ways.
He has your eyes, and that same stubborn chin.
When he was a baby, everybody said he'd look more like his father.
- When am I going to see him?
- He won't be back from school for two weeks... and I plan to stay in New York on business.
Look, why don't you wait and come to San Francisco with me?
I'm sure you could use the time yourself.
Shopping, for example.
Shopping?
But I have no money.
You have now.
[Narrating]
This is what I had dreamed about-
like the days back home in Poland before the war.
The feel of silk on my skin again.
- What do you think?
- It's lovely.
Yes, but I'm afraid it's also very expensive.
Don't worry about that.
After all, I'm still Chris's guardian.
I'm sure he'd want his mother to look her best.
All right, then.
- Do you like it?
- It's beautiful.
I- I just have to put my shoe on, and I'm ready.
May I help you?
[Narrating]
I make no excuse.
I felt Alan was attracted to me, and I was prepared to take advantage of it.
Was I in love with him?
I don't know.
But I did know that the best way for me to be safe...
was to be married to an American.
[Alan]
A penny for them, Karin.
A penny for what?
Your thoughts.
It's an expression we have.
Oh, Alan, I-
I couldn't begin to tell you all my thoughts.
You've been so wonderful to me.
I don't know if I ever can, Karin, but...
I'd like to spend the rest of my life trying to make up to you... for all those lost years.
I want you to know, I'm no bargain.
I'm a very stubborn man... set in my ways and hard to live with.
And maybe
I'm too old to change.
I don't want you to change, Alan, ever.
[Narrating] Three days later, we were married in Connecticut.
And now Alan was bringing me home to San Francisco.
There they are!
- Hello!
- Hello, Chris.
Chris, this is your mother.
- Well, what do you think?
Shall we keep her?
- Hello.
Hello, Chris.
- Hello, Margaret.
- Hello, Mr. Spender.
Darling?
This is Margaret.
- How do you do?
- Welcome home, Mrs. Spender.
Thank you. I've heard how much you've done for Chris.
- I'm very grateful.
- May I offer my congratulations?
Well, thank you, Margaret.
Well, let's go get the taste of the train out of our mouths, huh?
[Victoria Narrating] And so, at last,
I came to the house on Telegraph Hill.
Wait till you see the view in the daytime.
Come on, now, Chris.
It's way past your bedtime.
- Remember, now, you promised.
- Okay.
- Can I help you carry it?
- Thank you, dear.
If there's anything that doesn't please you, just holler.
- We'll change it any way you like it.
- Oh, no.
I like it just as it is.
It's so old and beautiful.
It's getting pretty late, dear.
You must be tired.
- You can see the house tomorrow.
- All right.
Such a beautiful portrait of Aunt Sophie.
I wish I had known her better.
I never realized you knew her at all.
Oh, yes. Once, when I was very little, she visited us in Poland.
She looked so kind and wise.
She was that.
She was a wonderful woman.
I put your bags in your room.
- Well, thank you, dear.
- This is my room. You wanna see it?
Tomorrow, Chris.
Your mother's tired, and it's way past your bedtime.
Yes, Chris,
I am a little tired.
I'll show you the whole place tomorrow, if you want.
I know a place where you can see
Point Lobos. That's where they used to send signals from.
- That would be very nice.
- Good night, Chris.
- Sleep well, darling.
I'll see you in the morning.
- Okay. Good night.
I, uh- I didn't know what arrangements you'd want to make... so I had the guest room made up for the night.
- Thank you, Margaret.
- Good night, Mrs. Spender.
Good night, Margaret. There are so many things you'll have to teach me.
I'll be glad to do what I can.
Here we are, right down here.
- This is lovely.
- I'm glad you like it.
Some people thought I was crazy to stay on in the house after Aunt Sophie died... but I-
I've always loved the old place.
You take that chair, for instance.
It's a monstrosity, isn't it?
I wouldn't give that up for anything in the world.
When I was a kid, my mother and I used to come out to the house... on special occasions, you know:
Thanksgiving, Christmas,
Aunt Sophie's birthdays.
You see, we weren't immediate family.
More like poor relations.
But Aunt Sophie'd always have us up for those family days... and I always loved that chair.
I sat in it every time.
Came to think of it as my chair.
It was a symbol to me then of this house, the life that was lived in it.
It still is.
- [Knocking]
- [Alan] Come in.
- Thank you, Cai.
- Good night, sir.
Good night.
I always have a glass of orange juice... just before going to bed.
- Oh.
- Now, don't forget.
I'm a native Californian.
Mmm. Good idea.
Why did Margaret have the guest room made up?
Oh, I suppose I should've sent her some instructions... but I wanted to leave everything to you.
I think this room is big enough for both of us.
I hope so.
But I do think you'll be more comfortable here if I take the guest room for the night.
And then tomorrow, we can go downtown and pick out everything we need.
Alan, I love you.
[Rattling]
[Narrating]
I had come halfway across the world.
And, now, suddenly, in this pleasant room...
a little of the fear I had once felt in Belsen came back to me.
Whether it was my own conscience...
or meeting with little Chris...
or something in the house itself,
I couldn't tell.
I had a strange feeling that Aunt Sophie saw through me.
I wondered- if I could have spoken to her-
whether she would have understood.
She did look kind and wise.
Yet, I couldn't rid myself of the feeling that something was wrong in this house.
- [Door Closes]
- [Margaret Shouting, Indistinct]
[Alan, Indistinct]
[Margaret Continues, Indistinct]
Karin, what are you doing down here?
Well, I- I couldn't sleep.
I just came down to see
Aunt Sophie's picture.
It's kind of a strange hour to be prowling around the house looking at pictures.
I'm not prowling, Alan.
I'm sorry, but you seemed so tired.
And you?
You haven't been to bed at all yet.
I came down to look over my mail. I wanted to see if there's anything important.
Margaret heard me coming down.
She brought me a sandwich and a glass of milk.
Oh. Margaret has been in the house a long time, hasn't she?
Ever since Chris was brought here from Europe.
He needed someone to look after him.
She's been very faithful.
You know, one thing about Aunt Sophie.
She knew people inside out.
She picked her out of 50 applicants to take care of Chris.
Margaret has... many unusual qualities.
I believe you.
I also think she's a very unusual woman.
Are you going to be much longer?
No, just a little while.
You better run along to bed.
- Good night.
- Good night.
[Door Closes]
- Hi!
- Hi!
- It's late. You always sleep so late?
- I was very tired last night.
I've been waitin' for you since 7:00.
Oh, you shouldn't have done that.
Oh, it's all right. I'm always up early.
Comin' down soon?
Well, it will take me a while to get dressed.
Okay. Hurry up.
Hey, good catch.
You're learnin' fast, Mom.
What's the matter?
Hurt your hand?
No, darling.
It didn't hurt at all.
That's good.
Come on! Throw the ball!
Chris.
You've missed not having your mother very much, haven't you?
Sure. I guess so.
But you were so little when you were brought here... you couldn't possibly remember her.
Well, Aunt Sophie always talked about you a lot... and cried for a long time when they told her you had died.
And you?
Did you cry too?
I- I don't remember.
It made me feel kind of funny.
But, anyway, it isn't true.
- Come on! Pitch!
- Pitch?
- You know, throw it.
- Oh.
Oop! Oh! I am so clumsy.
Don't worry. You'll learn, Mom.
Hey! Good one! Yippee!
To the lady of the house, past and present.
May your days in this house be as rich and rewarding as hers.
Thank you, Doctor.
[Man] Great character.
Don't make 'em like that anymore.
Nobody knows that any better than I do.
She was a wonderful, wonderful woman.
She had a wonderful sense of humor.
In fact, she'd laugh her head off if she could see this little votive group...
gathered under her portrait, drinking her vintage wine... growing mawkish over her memory.
- Hello, Alan. Dr. Burkhardt.
- Marc.
- Mr. Whitmore.
- Hello, Marc.
- Mrs. Whitmore. You look lovely tonight.
- Thank you, Marc.
There's a rumor around town that you've gotten married.
Comes with a great wailing and gnashing of teeth from the direction of Nob Hill.
Darling, may I present
Marc Bennett.
He's an old friend. We've known each other since grammar school.
- My wife.
- Mrs. Spender.
Is something on your mind, old boy?
Frankly, yes.
I, uh- How far behind am I?
Oh, I'd say you had a pretty good head start.
I seem to have run down suddenly.
- How about a nice, friendly push?
- Sure.
- Champagne all right?
- Whiskey with a little water, if you don't mind.
- But don't drown it.
- That would be a catastrophe, huh?
Fix it for you myself.
You don't remember me, do you?
You're making things tougher for me by the minute.
- That accent- is it Polish?
- Uh-huh.
And what red-letter day did I meet a beautiful Polish lady?
On the most important day in her life, Major.
Germany.
The camp at Belsen. Of course.
But you've changed quite a bit.
No wonder I didn't recognize you.
I've often wondered what had become of you.
I don't believe you remember anything about me at all.
Oh, but I do.
I-I even remember your name.
It's Victoria.
Victoria Der-
Dernakova, Major.
And it's Karin, not Victoria.
Karin.
K-A-R-I-N?
- Mm-hmm.
- [Alan] Here we are.
Thank you.
- Dinner is served.
- Thank you, Cai.
May I claim the right as an old friend of the household?
Looks like you have already.
[Chattering]
[Piano: Classical]
[Mock Snoring]
[Sighs] Be a shame to wake him, even for ice cream.
- Faker! A favor for a favor.
- Thanks!
Oh, don't you like it?
Oh, sure. But, Margaret-
- Yes?
- Well, she usually doesn't let me eat after dinner.
Oh, but this is a special occasion, isn't it?
- Oh, sure.
- And maybe we just won't tell Margaret, huh?
- She'll find out.
- [Laughs]
Is something wrong, Mrs. Spender?
Nothing at all, Margaret.
I just brought Chris a dish of ice cream.
Chris doesn't usually eat just before going to bed.
Well, I just thought with everybody having fun downstairs that-
Of course, if you prefer him not to have it, I-
Why, not at all.
It's up to Chris.
What do you think, Chris?
I can put it in the icebox for lunch tomorrow.
Okay.
We find it better to let Chris make his own decisions.
I see.
It will taste better at lunch, Chris.
- Good night, dear.
- Good night.
[Piano Continues]
I am sorry, Margaret.
I didn't realize-
Oh, it was my fault, Mrs. Spender.
I should have told you.
But Chris has always been a very impulsive child.
I found the best way to handle him is to let him discipline himself.
- Good night, Margaret.
- Good night, Mrs. Spender.
Five pounds.
Nice avocado today. Zucchini.
- I recommend the zucchini.
- Major.
With a touch of garlic and mozzarella, there's nothing like it.
- [Italian]
- [Italian]
All right, get the lady a couple of pounds.
- The real stuff, now, from the basement.
- Sì, signore. The best.
Small world, isn't it? Germany,
Telegraph Hill, and the New Union Grocery.
You do your marketing here too, Major?
Only since I found it's where you do yours.
Besides, we didn't have a chance to finish our talk the other evening.
Well, it isn't pleasant for me to talk about things that happened in the camp.
I'd like to forget about them.
That's, uh-That's not what I wanted to talk to you about.
I was telling my cook about that chicken dish I had at your house the other night.
- She can't swing it without the recipe.
- [Laughs]
Don't laugh. I'm a San Franciscan.
Eating's serious business with me.
I thought the law was your business, Major.
Technically, it is. You see, my father's death put me in a curious situation.
According to the sign on the door,
I'm the senior member of the firm.
But most of our clients seem to wanna do business with the junior members.
One of'em's 65, the other's 62.
So that leaves me twiddling my thumbs and cleaning out ashtrays.
- And finding new recipes for your cook.
- Exactly.
If I give you the recipe... will you tell me something too?
Blackmail, huh?
You and Alan do not like each other. Why?
Where did you ever get an idea like that?
I saw you together at the house.
Well, the fact is that Alan thinks
I've had things too easy all my life.
You know, a rich man's son, lazy and drinks too much.
Unfortunately, he's right.
- Two pounds mozzarella. The best.
- All right, Tony.
I'll take these too.
Well, I think this is everything.
I'm sure you have some good points, Major.
Oh, I suppose so. I'm kind to animals.
Handle a boat pretty well.
And you play the piano beautifully.
- And I make beautiful circles on a bar with a highball glass.
- Thank you, Mrs. Spender.
- Let me know how you like the mozzarella.
- I will, Tony. Good-bye.
Bye. Well, now that that's all settled, how about lunch?
- I'm afraid I couldn't.
- Why not?
'Cause you're married now?
Believe me, I'm very much aware of it, and I respect it.
Husbands are husbands, and friends are friends.
And, who knows? Someday, you might need a friend.
Some other time, perhaps.
They are expecting me home for lunch today.
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.
[Laughs]
Oh, I'm sorry!
I'm not fast enough for you.
Chris, a little playhouse.
You never told me about it.
I don't play in it anymore.
It's no good.
- Oh, we will fix it and use it again.
- Here's the ball, Mom.
- Come on.
- We had one at home.
- It was so much fun.
- Don't go in there.
Is there something you don't want me to see?
No, but it's dangerous.
- Chris, what happened there?
- It was the explosion.
Explosion?
What kind of explosion?
My chemical set.
It happened a long time ago.
Come on, Mom!
Let's play some more ball!
Tell me, darling, were you hurt?
No, it was nothing.
It just made a loud noise.
Well, I'm going to ask Alan to have it fixed.
No! Please don't, Mom.
- Why not?
- 'Cause he doesn't know anything about it.
He wasn't here when it happened.
You won't tell him, Mom, will you?
Of course not, if you don't want me to.
We'll just keep it between us, okay?
Okay. Thanks, Mom.
- Come on! Pitch!
- Pitch.
Good one!
Throw it overhand, like that.
[Knocking]
[Knocking]
Margaret?
Margaret?
- Is there something you wanted, Mrs. Spender?
- Oh.
I'm sorry, Margaret.
I-I was looking for you... and I couldn't help admiring this beautiful album.
- Was it Aunt Sophie's?
- Yes.
- She gave it to me.
- Oh.
- What is it you wanted, Mrs. Spender?
- [Lock Clicks]
Oh, I-I just wanted to ask you... what exactly happened in the little playhouse?
- The playhouse?
- Yes.
Did Chris take you there?
No. I-I came upon it by accident.
I asked Chris, but he didn't want to talk about it.
He did say there was an explosion from his chemical set.
[Chuckles]
Oh, nonsense.
His chemical set was just a harmless toy.
He must have stolen something from the kitchen- some cleaning fluid or something that caused the explosion.
Chris thinks Mr. Spender still doesn't know, but... of course, you told him, Margaret.
No, I never did.
Margaret, you should have.
Well, Chris was terribly afraid Mr. Spender would punish him. He begged me not to tell.
But Chris should have been made to understand never to do a thing like that.
He could have been killed.
Well, he wasn't.
He wasn't hurt at all.
I saw no reason to make an issue of it then... and certainly there's no reason to make an issue of it now.
I'm not trying to make an issue of it, Margaret.
But, surely, you can't blame me for being worried and- and very much concerned.
Concerned. How long have you been concerned about Chris, a few weeks?
I've been concerned about him all his life, night and day.
And, now, you tell me that you're concerned... about something that happened years ago.
Even then, it was I who comforted him, not you.
Thank you for being so frank.
Now I know where we stand.
From the moment I came here, you've looked upon me as an intruder in this house.
That's why you dare talk to me like this.
Well, I'll tell you something.
You're wrong, Margaret.
You are the intruder, not I.
- Are you giving me notice, Mrs. Spender?
- Yes.
I was a fool not to do it long ago.
Very well.
I'll start packing at once.
- [Whispers] Alan?
- Hello, darling.
I thought you would never get home.
What's the matter?
Anything wrong?
No, not anymore.
I had it out with Margaret.
She's leaving.
You what?
Have you both gone crazy?
- Do you want to hear what happened?
- I don't care what-
- This is ridiculous!
- But, darling... you wouldn't say that if you'd heard how she talked to me.
She acted as if
Chris was her child... and she even accused me of deliberately turning him against her and you.
Oh. So it's about Chris.
Well, can't you see, darling?
Margaret is jealous... because the boy's become so attached to you.
You should be the first to understand that.
And you, you should be the first to understand... that Margaret and I can never live together in the same house.
Now, look, Karin.
Margaret has given years of her life to Chris.
You can't just dismiss her... like a servant that stepped out of line.
You're upset now, darling. But when you've had time to think it over... you'll realize I'm right.
If Margaret said anything to you she shouldn't have, she'll apologize.
I'll see to that myself.
[Knocking]
- Come in.
- [Door Opens]
May I speak to you for a moment, Mrs. Spender?
Please, come in.
- What is it, Margaret?
- About yesterday,
I should like to apologize.
I said things I shouldn't have.
I'm sorry.
It doesn't matter. Mr. Spender wishes you to remain. You know that.
But things will be very difficult if you feel that I can't be trusted with Chris.
What happened between us has nothing to do with Chris.
I never doubted that you have
Chris's welfare at heart.
It's kind of you to say so, Mrs. Spender... but I'd feel better if you accepted my apology too.
Very well. I accept it, if that makes you feel better.
Isn't it time to bring
Chris home from the party?
I'm leaving right now.
[Door Closes]
[Latch Clicks]
Oh. Alan.
What are you doing in there?
I-I was just looking around.
- Looking around?
- Mm-hmm.
- For what?
- Nothing, Alan.
Nothing. I-
I just wanted to see the inside of the playhouse.
- [Screams]
- [Chris] Mom?
[Gasping]
- Mom!
- Chris!
Darling, I'm so glad to see you.
- Tell me, did you have a good time at Jimmy’s party?
- Mm-hmm.
- Did he like your present?
- Yep.
- Tell me all about it.
- Well, we went out on a pony ride, and-
Karin.
Darling, will you please tell me what's bothering you?
I'm tired, Alan.
I-I have a headache.
I don't mean now.
I mean this afternoon in the playhouse.
You shied away from me as if I had the plague.
If I hadn't grabbed you-
I completely forgot about that wall.
- Forgot?
- I should've had it fixed right after the explosion.
But I didn't realize it was such a hazard.
What's the matter now?
You-You know what happened to Chris in the playhouse?
Well, of course I do.
Wasn't I supposed to know?
Well, Margaret told me just the other day that you didn't know- that she never told you.
Oh. Well, you must have misunderstood.
After four years, I don't suppose
Margaret remembers herself how it was.
But it's certainly nothing for you to start worrying about now.
Your hands are like ice.
Is something going on in that funny little head of yours?
- Something you're keeping from me?
- I'm not keeping anything from you, Alan.
You make me feel as though
I've failed you somehow- as though I haven't been the husband I wanted to be.
No, it isn't you, Alan.
Sometimes, things come back- things I want to forget.
I can't help it.
You must be patient with me.
I'll be all right.
Of course you will, darling.
It takes time.
We'll just have to try harder to- to make you forget.
Chris? You forgot to make up your room again.
I didn't forget.
I'm just goin' to market with Mom now.
- I'll do it when we get back.
- Oh, Chris, you promised.
Go right in and do it now.
I'll wait for you.
Would you like me to go to the market for you, Mrs. Spender?
Cook said he wanted the chops for lunch.
Ooh, that's right.
No, I'll go, Margaret.
I'm sorry, darling.
You'll come with me next time, okay?
Okay.
[Tires Screeching]
[Horn Honking]
[Honking]
Chris? Chris?
Are you hurt, lady?
- What happened?
- [Muttering, Indistinct]
- You better cut the motor off.
Somebody, get an ambulance.
- Yeah, I'll go get one.
- I wouldn't move around, lady.
- What happened?
- They're getting an ambulance for you.
- Did anybody see what happened?
I-I don't want an ambulance.
I'm all right.
You better let me take you home, huh, lady? Where do you live?
Home? No, I- Please, will you take me to a telephone?
Yeah, sure. Sure thing, lady.
Hello. Mr. Marc Bennett, please.
Yes?
Oh? Put her on.
Hello, Karin. How are you?
An accident?
Are you all right?
Oh. Yes. Well, let me call Alan-
Oh, no, I don't want Alan to-
Marc, please, don't call Alan.
I want to see you alone, now.
All right. I just thought that-
I'll be right there.
What's the address?
So after the man brought me here to the telephone, he sent for a tow car.
And then he kept insisting
I have a doctor look at me right away.
- He should have. It was a terrible thing to have happen.
- Oh, Marc, it didn't "happen."
It wasn't an accident.
He made the brakes so they wouldn't work.
- He's trying to kill me!
- Hey, hey.
Let's not go off the deep end again.
You've had a bad shock.
Now, who's trying to kill you?
- Alan.
- Alan?
Oh, Marc, please believe me.
I'm not hysterical now.
He wants to get rid of me.
I've felt it for a long time.
Can't you see it, Marc?
Aunt Sophie left everything to Chris.
Alan is his guardian.
If something should happen to him...
Alan would get the estate.
And Chris could have been with me in the car this morning.
He wants us out of the way.
It's for the money, Marc.
Don't you see?
You don't, do you?
But why would he marry you?
He didn't have to, you know.
He may have been attracted to me.
I don't know.
But you don't think he was going to let... the boy's mother take everything away from him, do you?
There's one way to find out.
Come on.
Your master cylinder's bone-dry.
These are hydraulic brakes.
No fluid, they don't work.
- How come no fluid?
- A leak, right here.
A break in the line going to the front wheel.
That's an unusual place to spring a leak, isn't it?
Well, it don't happen every day, but it can happen.
Look, you've been over this thing pretty thoroughly.
Is it possible that somebody might have tampered with that brake line deliberately?
Anything's possible.
My guess is you hit a rock or something.
- Okay, thanks.
- Yeah.
I suppose you think I'm crazy.
But I cannot help it.
I cannot help what I feel.
Karin, it's no news to you that I'm not very fond of Alan.
I think he'd do almost anything to hold onto the nice, cushy life he's made for himself.
I don't think he'd be crazy enough to try a thing like this.
I don't know.
I don't know what to think anymore.
I'm sorry to have given you so much trouble for nothing.
For nothing?
I told you once, you might need a friend.
You came to me as a friend.
I don't consider that nothing.
What you need is somebody to teach you how to relax and enjoy life... something Alan never learned.
He's been so busy trying to get up to that house on the hill that... he's been blind to everything else.
I must go home, Marc.
Well, at least you stopped calling me "Major." That's a net gain.
[Creaking]
- Where have you been?
- I was hungry, and...
I went down to the kitchen for a glass of milk.
You'd better come to bed.
It's very late.
Yes, dear. In a minute.
[Phone Ringing]
- Yes?
- Fowler? Marc Bennett.
Say, my client will be here in a few minutes.
Can you give me any idea what your report will be on those gloves?
I think I can. I wanna run one more test just to double-check, but-
I see.
No, I'll be right here waiting for it, thanks.
Karin!
Alan. What are you doing here?
Me? I just went up to see my insurance man.
Where are you going?
To the dentist.
I have an appointment.
- Dr. Lipman?
- Mm-hmm.
Darling, he's in the medical building.
Oh. Oh, you're right.
I-I wonder how the taxi driver could have made such a mistake.
Well, I'm glad he did. It gives me a chance to give a beautiful lady a lift.
As a matter of fact, it's, uh, almost 4:00.
I'll wait for you.
We'll drive home together.
4:00? I didn't realize it was so late.
I-I'm afraid
I've missed my appointment.
Well, you can see him tomorrow.
I'll tell you what. Let's have an early dinner and take in a movie, huh?
Uh-huh.
[Door Opens]
- Hello, Margaret.
- Good evening.
- Where's Chris?
- He's in his room listening to the radio.
- Any calls?
- Mr. Marc Bennett.
Did he leave any message?
He just said he'd be in his office until
6:00 if either of you returned by then.
Thank you, Margaret.
Mr. Bennett, please.
Mr. Spender calling.
- Relax, darling.
It can't be anything important.
- [Exhales]
Hello, Marc?
I understand you called.
Oh, fine, thanks.
How about yourself?
Tonight? Just a minute.
Karin's right here. I'll ask her.
He wants to take us to dinner tonight.
What do you say?
- Whatever you like, Alan.
- Well, Karin says she'd love to.
Sure. 8:30's fine.
Mm-hmm. I'll see you then.
- What's the matter, darling?
- [Chuckles]
I was just thinking, I've spent so little time with Chris today.
Oh, stop worrying about Chris for a change.
It'll do you good to get out.
Yes, Alan.
[Singing In Foreign Language]
[Continues]
- [Ends]
- [Applause]
Oh, will you excuse me? I- I promised to call Chris and say good night.
[Jazz]
- You must have a crystal ball.
- What do you mean?
- Your call this afternoon. May I?
- Of course.
- I was just gonna call you.
- Really? Anything special?
- It's about Karin.
- Karin?
This afternoon, coming down from Charlie Decker's office,
I ran into her in the lobby.
She almost jumped out of her skin when she saw me.
I could have sworn she was on her way up to see you. Was she, Marc?
Why didn't you ask her?
I did. She told me she was going up to see her dentist.
- Well, that seems to settle it, doesn't it?
- No, not quite.
You see, her dentist happens to be in the medical building.
That's quite a long way from your place.
So she made a mistake. So what?
People don't make mistakes like that, unless it's part of a pattern.
Look, I'm not very good at riddles.
What's on your mind?
I'm worried about Karin.
I don't have to tell you what she went through in Europe.
I've tried everything to make her forget.
- I blame myself for letting her drive.
- [Ends]
That accident on the hill didn't help her nerves any.
- [Applause]
- A thing like that would play hard with anybody's nerves.
- [Resumes]
- Of course, but with her it seems to-
I don't know.
Suddenly she's become suspicious of everything and everybody around her.
I talked to Dr. Burkhardt about it.
He suggested I take her to a specialist.
I know you've never thought very much of me, Marc- too pushing and ambitious for your taste.
Well, maybe you're right.
But Karin's made a difference in my life.
My only ambition now is to make her happy.
And I'm helpless.
The harder I try, the more
I realize that... I'm losing her.
[Chuckles]
It's ironic, isn't it?
Yeah, life's full of little ironies.
And I'm afraid it's something you're gonna have to work out between yourselves.
Would you like to dance?
Go ahead, darling.
The report from the chemist, Marc- what does it say?
I'm sorry, Karin. There wasn't a trace of grease or oil on those gloves.
But those spots, Marc, those dark spots.
Ink. Nothing but plain, ordinary blue-black ink.
Karin, I'd like to tell you that Alan is a black-hearted monster... capable of the worst crimes in the book.
I can't, 'cause I'd be lying, and I- I can't lie to you.
I know you've been through so much- those years at the camp, and-
But you've got to snap out of this mood.
Oh, I'm not hysterical, Marc.
Please believe me.
I've realized now, there was something wrong from the beginning: the way they tried to keep me from coming to America; the cold, heartless cables... some lawyers send me that Aunt Sophie was dead, and not a word about Chris-
- What lawyers?
- I don't know.
I don't remember their names.
- Why? Is it important?
- No, I- I just wondered.
I can show you the cable.
Alan doesn't know, but I still have it.
I could bring it to your office.
- All right. Why don't you?
Like to get a look at it.
- All right, Marc. Tomorrow.
- I'll bring it to your office in the morning, huh?
- All right.
Oh, no.
After what happened today,
I- I shouldn't go there again.
- Where could we meet?
- [Ends]
- Well, let me see.
- [Applause]
The yacht basin at the marina.
- Any taxi driver will know where it is.
- [Resumes]
- [Marc] Thank you.
- Wait a minute.
It's my turn now.
[Boat Whistle Blows In Distance]
My secretary searched all the files and checked with everybody... and says there's absolutely no record of this having been sent from our office.
But it is signed, " Bennett, Compton and Maxwell." Your firm, Marc.
- Then I'm right.
Alan sent the cable himself.
- It's possible.
But see, this is dated May 31, 1945.
My father was still alive then.
He handled your aunt's affairs.
Alan could have showed him the cable just as he told you.
And unfortunately, now there's no way of finding out what actually did happen.
Look. First thing Monday morning,
I'll call Callahan.
That's the lawyer you met in New York.
- He may be able to tell us something.
- I hope so.
Now, don't be afraid.
I've got to get home now.
I promised to take Chris to the ball game.
You are afraid, aren't you?
Sometimes, yes.
But not when I am with you.
That's what I want to talk to you about.
There's no sense in our going-
Oh, Marc. No, not now.
It- It isn't right.
What is right- for you to go on living with Alan, feeling the way you do about him?
For us to exchange polite small talk every time we meet?
- Is it wrong for me to say that I'm in love with you?
- No, Marc. No.
But it is wrong for someone to lie, to cheat... even if only to find happiness and safety.
Now what are we talking about?
About me. I'm not
Chris's mother, Marc.
Karin Dernakova died in Belsen.
I took her papers and stole her name.
- Victoria.
- Yes. Victoria Kowelska.
That's my real name.
- Victoria Kowelska.
- But, Marc, you didn't hear what I said.
- I'm not Chris's-
- Sure, sure. You're not Chris's mother.
What do you want me to do- condemn... a starved, scared, homeless girl who saw a chance for a better life and grabbed it?
I saw Belsen too, Karin.
[Sobs]
But I am trapped now by my own lies.
Even if Alan lets me go, he will never let me have Chris.
- And I will not leave him behind in that house!
- Well, that's it.
You've been living with this on your conscience so long, you've magnified these things.
Oh, no. Please don't think that.
Chris is in real danger.
- You've said that before. Nothing is gonna happen to Chris.
- Something is going to happen.
If I only could make you believe it.
- I love him so much, and he needs me.
- I know he does.
- I'm gonna talk to Alan. I think-
- Oh, no, Marc.
Alan mustn't know
I told you anything.
[Sighs]
There must be a way to prove all this to you.
Will you stop tearing yourself apart?
Take Chris to the ball game.
Have some fun for a while.
- Karin.
- Hmm?
I said, take Chris to the ball game.
Get away from the house for the afternoon.
- Yeah.
- Would it help if I call later... when I find out what Callahan has to say?
- Yes, call me. Maybe I-
- Now, don't do anything silly.
Chris will be all right.
- Oh, I- I hope so.
- [Boat Whistle Blows In Distance]
- Hello, Margaret.
- Good afternoon, Mrs. Spender.
- Where's Chris?
- He's having his lunch.
He said you were taking him to the ball game. I'll tell him you're back.
All right.
Margaret, uh-
[Chuckles] Would you mind very much taking Chris to the game?
He has been counting on it, and... I have such a bad headache.
- Why, I'll be glad to take him, if you like.
- Thank you.
[Victoria] Good-bye, darling.
Have a good time.
- And, remember, just one hot dog.
- Okay, Mom. And I'll keep the scorecard for ya.
Bye, Mom! Bye!
- Bye!
- Good-bye!
[Thinking]
"Death came yesterday"-June 3.
But the cable was sent in May.
She wasn't dead then.
- Hello, dear.
- Oh, Alan.
Well, go ahead.
Finish your call.
It's not important.
- Well, who were you calling?
- My watch stopped. I wanted to find out the correct time.
Oh.
It's about a quarter of two.
Um, 14 of.
- All right.
- Margaret called and said you weren't feeling well.
- I thought I'd come home and keep you company.
- Thank you, dear.
It was just a headache.
It's gone now.
But, darling, if you have work to do, please, don't let me hold you back.
I'm all right now.
Well, of course, I can always find something to do. Um-
Okay. Put on your coat and come along.
The drive will do you good.
Oh, I don't think so, Alan.
I'd rather stay home.
Why don't you go?
No. The work will keep until tomorrow.
Why, you haven't eaten a thing, Karin.
Why don't you try the soufflé?
It's excellent.
Yeah, Mom. It's swell.
- I'm not hungry, darling.
Would you like to have mine too?
- Yeah, sure!
If you don't mind, I'll go to the library and read while you're having your coffee.
Well, go ahead, dear.
I'll join you in a few minutes.
- Good night, Margaret.
- Good night, Mrs. Spender.
- Good night, darling.
- Good night, Mom.
Karin.
I think I'll have my coffee with you.
[Phone Rings]
You're even more jittery tonight than usual, darling.
[Rings]
Hello.
Hello?
Hello?
Wrong number, I guess.
Well, maybe he just changed his mind... whoever it was.
You look tired.
You're going to bed right now.
Come along.
I-I think I left a cigarette burning.
Feeling you left something behind, you forgot something-
I could have sworn
I left a cigarette burning in there... and I wasn't even smoking.
- [Knocking]
- [Alan] Come in.
- [Door Opens]
- I'll take it, Cai.
Yes, sir. Good night.
Good night.
[Glassware Clinks]
[Liquid Pouring]
[Utensil Stirring Liquid]
[Door Closes]
You do look tired, dear.
You drink your juice, and we'll turn in.
I left my book in the library.
I'm going down to get it.
Now, how do you expect to get enough sleep if you stay up reading till all hours?
Just for a little while.
Please, Alan.
Just a minute, darling.
I'll get your book for you.
[Victoria]
Hello, Operator?
- [Tapping Receiver]
- Hello?
Operator!
[Hangs Up]
[Doorknob Clicks]
[Door Closes]
Thank you.
Oh, don't forget your juice, dear.
It'll help you sleep.
Uh, no, I don't think I want it tonight.
It doesn't taste right.
Well, what's the matter with it?
[Sighs] It seems a little bitter.
Bitter?
Tastes fine to me.
Come on, dear.
Doctor's orders.
The trouble with you is you don't know how to relax.
Come on, dear. Don't fight it.
Just close your eyes.
Aren't you going to bed, Alan?
What is it, Alan?
Why do you look at me so?
I was thinking about a day not too long ago.
We met in Callahan's office?
You were scared out of your wits, but you carried it off magnificently.
I thought then, " This woman has everything: breeding, brains, fire.
I could be happy with a woman like this."
Then something else said,
"Watch out. She'll give you trouble."
Trouble? What trouble could I give you, Alan?
Why, don't be stupid, Karin.
You know very well what sort of trouble.
Alan, what are you afraid
I'd take away from you?
- Is it the money?
- Money?
[Exhales]
How scornful you are of money- you and Marc Bennett-
all you people who were born with it.
I should never have had to worry about money either.
Aunt Sophie's family had been wiped out in Europe. I was her only living relative.
And what did it get me?
A job as a clerk in the shipping office for $40 a week.
But it's all over. This is the last time
I'll have any trouble with your family.
[Laughs] You- You Poles must be made of iron: you, Chris, that old Aunt of yours.
Then it wasn't just Chris and me.
You had to kill
Aunt Sophie first.
You sent me the cable that she was dead, and- and then you killed her.
Just like that, huh?
Just like powdering your nose.
- You think it's easy to kill somebody?
- [Gasps]
It takes time and patience and courage... and a strong stomach.
Oh, stop it. Stop it.
I don't want to hear any more. You're mad!
Mad?
If it's madness not to let someone take from you what's rightfully yours, maybe I'm mad.
But everything I've done,
I've planned with a perfectly sane mind.
I've never wavered for an instant, and I'm not wavering now.
This house is mine.
The money's mine.
It's gonna stay mine.
You don't know what I went through with that old woman... your Chris.
Had to turn myself inside out, dance attendance on the kid like a monkey on a stick... just so she'd write me in as guardian for the boy.
You think I was gonna give all that up... just because you decided to come back from the grave, walk in and take over?
[Sobbing]
Alan, I don't care what happens to me anymore, but... please, in heaven's name, leave Chris out of it.
He's only a child.
He can do nothing to you- nothing.
Nothing... except take everything from me and kick me out of the house-
- if he ever comes of age.
- Alan!
- Don't worry. Chris is safe.
- [Sighs]
I'd have trouble with Margaret if anything happened to him. [Chuckles]
And you were the one that wanted to get rid of her.
However, Chris is not of age yet.
That's a long way off.
[Sighs]
And what are you going to do now, kill me?
I understand that Dr. Burkhardt has been giving you... prescriptions for your insomnia.
He seemed quite upset when I told him
I was the one that had the insomnia... worrying about your strange behavior.
He'll be grieved, the little doctor... when he hears that you've been hoarding your sedatives to... take them all at once... in a glass of orange juice.
Oh, A-Alan, you must call the doctor right away!
- Not quite yet, my dear.
- No, listen to me. I-
I didn't drink the juice you gave me.
You drank it.
- You're lying.
- No, no. I-
- You're lying!
- I am telling you the truth.
I- I was afraid.
And when you were downstairs,
I put what was left in the pitcher in a fresh glass and- and poured the juice you gave me back into the pitcher.
[Breathing Heavily]
- [Clicking Receiver]
- Hello. Hello, Operator-
Something is wrong with the telephone.
The library.
[Panting] The library.
[Handset Settles In Cradle]
Margaret!
M-Margaret!
What is it?
What's happened?
She- She poisoned me.
- No. It isn't true. He tried to poison me.
- Get a doctor, quick.
I tried to call, but something is wrong with the telephone.
Th-The library.
Th-The receiver's off in the library.
H- Hurry!
Gotta keep awake.
I gotta keep moving.
Keep- Huh? Oh, no.
You ju- stay away from me.
[Breathing Heavily]
[Woman]
I'm sorry, sir, but the line is busy.
It's been busy for the last 40 minutes.
Are you sure there isn't trouble on the line?
Oh. Did you get the doctor?
Doctor- is he- is he coming?
- Everything will be all right, Alan.
- Karin-
- Isn't there something more we can do?
- Get out.
Margaret. You must believe me.
He wanted to kill me.
You took him away from me.
You tried to take Chris away from me too.
But you won't have either of them, whatever happens.
Get out! This is still my room.
Now get out!
- Lie still, Alan.
- I'm gonna be all right, Margaret.
Something wrong, Mrs. Spender?
- It's Mr. Spender. He's taken-
Make coffee, lots of it. Hurry.
- Yes, ma'am.
[Strains]
I'm gonna be all right.
You remember, Alan- after the accident in the playhouse...
I told you that nothing was to ever happen to Chris again.
[Sputtering]
N-Nothing did. I-
I gave him my word.
Your word. If only
I didn't know you so well.
If I hadn't kept Chris from going with her in the car the other day, he might be dead now.
I did it for us, Margaret. It was so- so we could be together again, you know?
- Like old times?
- Old times.
- Old-
- And how long would it be before you'd try again with Chris?
- [Scoffs]
- How long before you'd finally kill him?
- [Door Opens]
- Mom.
Oh, darling.
I heard noises. I woke up.
It was a dream, darling-just a bad dream.
Come on. I'll tuck you in again.
Where's that doctor? He... should've been here a... long time ago.
- He isn't coming.
- Huh?
You left the receiver off the hook, Alan.
Remember? The phone is dead.
No, Margaret-
Margaret-
Margaret, you-you-you take the car.
You get somebody.
- You can't let me die.
- How many times have you let me die, Alan?
- No. I'll make it up to you,
Margaret. I swear I will.
- It's too late.
You're going to die, Alan, and that way, at least Chris will be safe.
No. It can't be!
Everything
I've w-worked for... planned for-
[Sobs]
Alan!
[Doorbell Ringing]
[Doorbell Ringing]
I don't know how long it was before I realized that the doorbell was ringing.
Uh-huh.
And that was you, Mr. Bennett?
Yes, Inspector. It was after 10:00 when
I finally located Callahan in Washington.
He said he'd never had any word from our office on the Albertson matter and dealt only with Alan.
So I called the house to have a showdown with Alan.
Kept getting a busy signal. The operator said the phone was off the hook... so I drove right over and called the station.
By the time your men got here,
Alan was dead.
Well, I'm going to have to take that governess downtown for questioning.
- Why? She didn't do anything.
- That's just it.
She deliberately didn't call the doctor.
She admits it. Harold, where's that governess, Miss-
- Upstairs to put the boy to bed.
Kid couldn't hold his head up.
- Why did you let her take him?
She didn't put him to bed.
She took him away! She told me she'd never let me have him!
Cover the back stairs and the garage.
Chris!
Oh, Marc, you see?
He's not here.
He's all right.
He's fast asleep.
[Sobs]
Yes, he's all right now.
He didn't want to go into his own room alone, so I brought him in here with me.
He fell asleep almost at once.
I'm going to have to ask you to come down to headquarters, miss.
- I'm ready.
- Margaret, I know you're not to blame for what happened.
What do you think the charge will be, Inspector?
That'll be up to the district attorney.
Everything will be all right, Margaret.
I'll be your witness.
My conscience will be my witness,
Mrs. Spender.
- I'm sure the D.A. will wanna talk to you too.
- We'll be available anytime.
- We'd better go.
- Go? But where?
I'm taking you to my mother's place for the time being.
I don't want you to spend another night in this house.
Yes, Marc.
- You don't have to apologize to her anymore.
- Do you think she'd understand?
She'd approve. I know.
She might even approve of me.
Then all I can do is to thank her for everything.
Let's go.
Crying isn't going to help.
I just can't help it.
Dory.
I've known about it for days... and I didn't want to say anything until I was sure.
But I've known.
No mistake possible?
No.
How far?
Two months, almost.
You didn't give the doctor your right name, did you?
No.
He knew I was lying.
It was awful.
You shouldn't have gone alone.
I should have gone with you.
What are we going to do?
Well...
I know you want me to say we'll get married right away, tomorrow, but...
You don't want to get out of it, do you?
Don't even think that.
I love you.
I love you.
I want to marry you more than anything else in the world.
Only, your...
He doesn't matter.
He's your father. He does.
What he thinks is important.
All I know is we don't have any choice.
Look, honey...
I know this is a shock, but it isn't the end of the world.
Sure, it's a problem, but a thing like this can change, Dory.
No.
There's always a chance. You know that.
I suppose so.
Come on.
That's better.
Come on, honey. We better go.
My mother will be home soon.
Okay?
Okay.
I don't feel good.
I can't even eat.
That's natural.
I know, but the girls in the sorority house... are gonna start asking questions.
I know what we can do about that.
A friend of mine, Hermy Gosset, remember him?
One of his cousins owns a pharmacy.
Hermy works there, nights.
I can talk to him.
Maybe he can give me something to make you feel better.
You won't say anything, will you?
Of course not.
Come on. Will you stop worrying?
Everything's going to be all right.
Okay.
Come on, honey. We'd better go.
Be careful you don't leave anything around.
Okay?
What's this bit?
This is an article on the curvature of space.
Curvature of space?
- Hi.
- How you been?
- Fine. Yourself?
- Pretty good.
Say, have you got something for an upset stomach, real potent?
I have something that just came in today.
That'll do it?
It should.
- Good night, Elsie.
- Night, Gordon.
- Don't get run over.
- Okay.
- How much?
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.
- Thanks, Hermy.
- You're welcome.
Dime.
Want to slide over, honey?
Here.
- What is it?
- I don't know for sure.
Something to settle your stomach.
It can't hurt you.
All right.
What are we gonna do?
I don't know.
I thought we'd wait awhile and see what happens.
Why do we have to wait?
Why don't we get married right now?
You know why as well as I.
He doesn't matter.
He hardly seems like a father at all.
What did he do to your mother?
Go on, say it. He threw her out.
One slip. He finds out years later, divorces her, sick and all... not caring one bit for you or your sister.
What do you think he'd do to you if we married this way... without me even meeting him?
And then a few short months later...
He'd forget you ever existed.
You wouldn't get a penny.
I don't care.
But I do. Not for me, certainly, but for you.
I've got to, for your sake, don't you see?
No!
You've had money all your life.
You couldn't do without it.
We'd be at each other's throats in a year.
We wouldn't. Not us.
All right.
Okay, honey, we love each other so much we never argue.
So, where are we?
In a furnished room with paper drapes, eating spaghetti seven nights a week?
If I saw you living like that, I'd take out insurance and jump in front of a car.
I had it planned so beautifully.
I'd have come to Payson with you, met him.
I'd have gotten him to like me.
We'd have gotten married, come back here to finish up.
Our little apartment of our own, right near campus.
No early-morning classes.
Stop it!
What are you trying to do?
Why are you saying these things?
Look, I'm pregnant, right now.
I know, honey.
I was trying to show you how beautiful it could've been.
But it isn't. It's the way it is.
I know it is, but all I'm asking is just wait a few days.
And if there's no change?
No question then.
None at all.
We'll get married right away and forget all about your father.
Okay?
Okay.
- Don't you want me to drive you home?
- No, thanks. I feel like walking.
Good night.
Good night.
- It's not right.
- What?
For anyone to love somebody as much as I love you.
That makes us even.
Then we haven't got anything to worry about.
Haven't you heard?
Love conquers all.
- Hello, Son.
- Hi, Mother.
- Had your dinner?
- I'm not hungry.
There's a sandwich in the kitchen.
I'll get it.
- Never mind. I don't feel like it.
- You've got to eat something.
Why?
- Aren't you feeling well?
- Mother, will you, please?
There's something wrong.
- You can't fool me. I know you too well.
- Please, will you?
It's just that...
I have to get something special ready for a speech tomorrow.
I haven't much time to do it in.
You work too hard. You should play more.
- I haven't any time.
- A person's got to relax sometime.
Look, I'm 25 years old.
Where am I? No place.
I don't want to wind up like Dad with holes in my shoes.
You're not like him. Not at all.
You'll see. Anything you decide to do, you'll do it.
I know.
Sure. I'm a genius.
I think so.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Any change?
I think we ought to decide and set a date.
You're not mad, are you?
Of course not.
Don't be so unhappy about it.
I know it's not the way we planned, but it'll be all right.
Sure. It'll be great.
- I'll quit school, get a job.
- No!
You won't have to.
You'll get more money from the government now because you have a wife.
$105 a month.
Other people get along.
Soda jerk.
How does that sound?
I had such plans.
Everybody expected so much of me.
It's all my fault.
- It's always the girl's fault.
- Look, maybe there is a way to tell your...
- We could call your father.
- No!
But we could appeal to him.
Tell him we did a terrible thing, make amends.
It won't do any good.
I know him. I know the way he feels about me.
- But all we have to...
- No!
We'll get along.
- Prove to him we don't need him.
- Who needs him? I'm only asking...
I don't even want him.
For the first time in my life,
I feel like me.
I'm not Dorothy anymore.
That's my father's daughter and his property.
I'm Dory now, because you said so.
Sure.
I've done wonders for you. I really have.
A new name, a new address...
Poverty Row it'll be.
No. I'm gonna be rich.
Don't you see?
I'll have everything I ever wanted.
I'll have somebody to love and to take care of.
And I'll have somebody to love me just for myself.
Okay, honey.
- We'll go down to the Municipal, Friday and...
- Why Friday?
A few days won't make any difference.
Be practical, honey.
There's things to take care of, the license...
Besides, if we go Friday, we'll have the whole weekend for our honeymoon.
That's right.
It's exciting, isn't it?
Let's go somewhere.
I can't. I've got a Chem lab and a ton of Spanish.
I want to get things cleared away, so we'll be free.
Okay.
I'll get to work, too.
I love you.
You don't want to get out of it, do you?
Silly. Who wants out?
- Call me?
- First chance.
You haven't told anybody? Your sister or...
No, but I thought I ought to.
- Is that wise?
- Ellen's all right.
- She'll understand. She'll even help.
- You know, I was thinking.
Maybe we ought to keep it our little secret until after the wedding.
Okay. Anything you say.
- You all right?
- Yes.
- You had me worried.
- It's all right.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Hey, Kingship.
You forgot our appointment last night, didn't you?
Gordon, I'm sorry.
I wasn't feeling very well.
You listen, young lady,
I've got a reputation.
No one that I've tutored thus far... has flunked out, so I don't want you starting anything.
I'm gonna be kind of busy next week, but what do you want me to do?
I think you run over Chapter 14 and try the problems, will you?
- And I am sorry. Bye.
- Bye.
- You in Albertson's class?
- No.
What's with him, anyway?
I don't know. He's like that, I guess.
Did he say aldehydes or ketones?
Aldehydes, I think.
I wish he wouldn't talk like he had a mouthful of mush.
- So long.
- So long.
I'm not much good without my notebook.
Let me see your notes.
Try it with ether.
I'm sure they'll fit.
I made them the same size as the other ones.
They're beautiful.
I want to do everything for you.
And I will.
Finish your hamburger, will you?
You remember that picture of me I gave you?
Could you lend it to me?
I'd like to make some copies.
Mother wants to send some to relatives.
Have you told her yet?
No. I didn't think it was fair.
You're not telling your family.
I'm dying to meet her.
What's that?
That's me, a couple of years ago.
Pretty skinny.
There's Dad, and that's Ellen.
It's her birthday.
She'd just gotten a new hi-fi set.
She's crazy about Debussy.
Not bad. A little beat.
I think it's very handsome, and I want it back.
Come on, honey.
It's getting late.
Darling, I've been meaning to ask you.
Can we go to the prom?
I thought you didn't want us to be seen around.
All those out-of-the-way places we've been going to.
I just didn't want it to get back to Dad that I was going steady.
It doesn't matter now.
- Do you really want to go to the prom?
- Please.
Then that's where you're going to go.
Hi.
I'm struggling with this Spanish.
I'll help you after class.
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
Last time, I'm afraid the bell interrupted us... at a time when we were developing several major concepts.
Because of that,
I think it might be a good idea... if we reviewed some of the ground that we covered last time.
I might point out to you, if I may, that our relationship demands eventually... a testing program in this class, and you might find it a good idea... to pay attention to what I am saying... and perhaps to this diagram on the board.
We discussed the Trinitarian aspect of it.
And certainly when we read in the works of Edwards, particularly... we saw a very painful thing.
We saw a man trying to reconcile predestination with free will.
And not succeeding, of course.
We discussed Puritanism, you may remember.
I don't want to say too much about it again... but remember that it, with its concept of predestination... you have what is essentially a pessimistic philosophy.
It might, in fact, even be called a theological determinism.
And then later we came to what I like to call "rationalism."
Now it's variously called other things.
The age itself is called the Age of Reason.
It's called the Age of Enlightenment.
Sometime, someplace, man in our society... surmounted it, and it will come out of it or perish.
Hello?
Dory? It's me.
Listen, I've got to see you right away.
I can't come out right now.
I just washed my hair.
It's important.
Has it anything to do with tomorrow?
- Yes.
- Something's wrong?
Just the opposite. It's wonderful news.
Tell me.
I want to see your face when I tell you.
You can meet me, can't you?
Where?
- How about the fountain? 15 minutes okay?
- Okay. Bye.
- Hi.
- Hi, Annabelle.
- Boy, have I been operating.
- You sound like it.
You know what happened?
I ran into this fellow I used to know.
Guess what he's doing?
He's assistant manager of the Desert Palms.
He thinks he can get us a bungalow for the weekend for a couple bucks.
Wonderful!
I'm on my way to see him, to see if he can swing it.
How's that for luck?
You feel better about it, don't you?
I admit, I was nervous at first.
But it's going to work out. I know it is.
Before I forget...
I saw Hermy today.
He gave me these.
- What are they?
- For you.
- I don't need anything. I feel fine.
- They're not for your stomach.
They're vitamins, high-potency stuff, brand-new.
Hermy just got some samples in.
He's going to order some more for us.
Fine mother you're going to be.
You don't even keep up with developments.
These were in all the leading medical journals last month.
Dutiful father.
I suppose you know what's in them, cover-to-cover.
I don't have to. I know Hermy.
Darling, I know you can't go to the doctor yet... but I do want you to start taking care of yourself.
- Nothing.
- Use your handkerchief.
The gelatin might melt.
You should take these after dinner... so you can do that when you get back to the house.
If you don't care about your family's health, I do.
Listen, honey, I gotta go.
I gotta meet Stanley.
Good night.
- Good night.
- Sweetheart...
Both of them.
Hello?
Dory? Me.
I just saw Stanley. It's all set.
We got the deal.
That's wonderful.
I already put down a deposit on it, to seal it.
Did you take the capsules?
- Yes.
- When?
Just a few minutes ago.
Listen, I forgot to tell you.
They might hurt a little, burn, or give you some pains.
But don't get frightened.
Hermy said that some people are allergic to them at first.
But you don't have to call anyone.
All right.
See you tomorrow?
Good night.
Goodbye, baby.
Thanks.
You're the greatest.
You want some eggs?
No, thanks.
I don't want to be late for class.
Mother, pick one.
You know, I've been thinking.
Maybe I'm wasting my time at the university.
- Why, what do you mean?
- I don't know.
I thought maybe I'd quit school, get a job in some big business.
I don't know.
You know, I've got an idea.
Why don't you quit work early tonight?
We'll go out to dinner and catch an early show.
You don't want to go out with me.
I certainly do.
You're still my best girl, aren't you?
And I've been neglecting you lately.
Tell Mr. Miller you want to leave early tonight... that you've got a date with your son.
We'll see.
What is it? What's wrong?
Darling...
It's my side, where I was wounded.
Just gives me a twinge once in a while.
I thought you were having a heart attack.
- I'm fine. Go back in class.
- Do you have them very often?
- The lecture's beginning.
- I don't care. I want to stay here with you.
You can't! I mean...
I got something important to do.
I gotta do it right now.
Will you go back in class?
- I don't want to.
- Then go to the house. I'll phone you.
- But, darling...
- I can't stand here.
Last night about 9:30.
I gotta get it back!
It was mailed by mistake.
- Sorry, I'd like to help, but it's too late.
- What do you mean?
It'll be delivered in an hour or so.
- Hello?
- Dory? Me.
Are you all right?
Just fine.
- Are you ready?
- What, now?
Didn't I tell you?
There's no point in waiting.
Meet me at Congress, by the clock, at 12:15.
You can make it, can't you?
- All I have to do is change.
- Good.
I better bring something along to prove I'm over 18.
- It's still our secret, isn't it?
- Of course.
Remember now, 12:15 sharp, okay?
Okay.
Hello, Husband.
I'm sorry I'm so late.
After you.
- Wait for me.
- Nervous bridegroom.
How dumb can you get?
I should've called first.
- 20 minutes yet.
- Let's go have a Coke.
I've got an idea.
Why don't we go to the roof?
It's a terrific day. We can see for miles.
Last chance to see the world as a single woman.
- Let's walk. It's only two flights.
- All right.
It's beautiful.
Look at that sky.
It's so bright.
Honey, look, the campus.
Look, you can almost see the house.
Boy, are those girls going to be surprised.
They don't even know I'm going with you.
I feel so good, I can't tell you.
You going to write your sister or phone?
Phone. Who can wait for letters?
- You'll like Ellen. You'll see.
- I'm sure I will.
Darling...
You're not sorry about the way things turned out, are you?
Of course not.
You know, I lied to you.
You know those pills you gave me?
I didn't take them.
Why not?
I'm so ashamed. I don't know how to say it.
It's just that...
I knew how you felt about the baby... at first anyway.
I was afraid you might want to...
It doesn't matter.
Anyway, I'm very ashamed.
But I'm glad I told you.
It's no way to start a marriage, with deceit.
I forgive you.
Don't look down.
You might get dizzy.
What did you do with the capsules?
They're in my bag.
New blouse?
No. It's old as the hills.
- You know something?
- What?
You look like a very happy girl.
I am.
- Never been a happier one.
- I have something to do with it?
Everything.
I've never felt like this before in my whole life.
I know what you mean.
- Hadn't we better go?
- There's time.
- You know something else?
- What?
You're really very sweet.
No foolin'.
The sweetest, gentlest person I've ever known.
You're prejudiced.
No.
It's true.
I love you.
I really do.
I believe you.
The thing is, you'll never really know how I love you.
I mean...
No one can really understand the way the other loves.
I don't believe that.
It's true.
It really is.
"Darling, I hope you'll forgive me for the unhappiness that I will cause.
"There is nothing else that I can do."
The note and the medical report seem to tell the whole story.
Terrible thing.
I sympathize.
I realize it's too late to keep the story out of the papers... but I'd appreciate it if certain details were omitted.
I understand.
Some things are best out of the papers, especially about youngsters.
I knew your daughter, Mr. Kingship.
She was a very fine girl.
- You knew her?
- Not as a policeman, but as a tutor.
I helped her in mathematics.
My nephew works in my office part-time while he's in school.
Did you... Have you any...
Have any idea who the man was?
No, but you realize, of course... he's not legally responsible for your daughter's death.
- Not legally.
- We can do some checking, if you like.
If you think it would accomplish anything... except to stimulate the kind of talk that you want to avoid.
- You're right.
- That seems to be all.
There were some valuables in her purse.
- Dispose of them as you see fit.
- But...
I'd consider it a favor.
Miss Kingship... if there's anything that I can do to be of assistance... in any official way, please feel free to call on me.
- My name's Gordon Grant.
- You've already been helpful, Mr. Grant.
You know, there's just no explaining why these things have to happen.
- I'm very sorry.
- Ellen?
Miss Ellen, Mr. Corliss is calling.
Thank you.
Hello, Bud.
I told you, you're coming here for Thanksgiving.
Yes.
I thought we could have dinner tonight here, too.
For once, let's get to the ballet on time.
All right, then.
Dinner out, if you're so proud.
7:00? I'll be ready.
Goodbye.
"Dear Ellen, you may recognize this as the belt to the suit Dorothy wore last.
"We were sorority sisters, and on her last day...
"... Just before she went out, she borrowed one of my belts.
"It was a cheap leather belt.
"We both knew it didn't go with her suit at all.
"Still, she wanted it and left this one in its place.
"I hope I was right in waiting these many months before sending it.
"Sincerely, Annabelle Koch. "
What is that?
Dorothy's belt.
A girl from her sorority sent it.
Very thoughtful of her.
Or thoughtless, however you feel about these things.
I'd have thrown it away and not mentioned it.
I know.
- What was accomplished by it?
- What has to be accomplished by it?
Some people do things out of nothing more than sentiment.
Softness, you'd probably call it.
As opposed to my callousness? My hardness?
I think, Ellen, you mistake parading an emotion... for feeling one.
I don't think I've paraded mine any more than you've felt yours.
If you've had one moment of remorse, one second when you even wondered... if you were responsible, then you've concealed it wonderfully.
You have my deepest admiration, if not sympathy.
That's true.
I haven't dwelt on the matter to the point of distorting the facts.
I haven't distorted them, not in my own mind at least.
I said once, long ago,
I couldn't believe she killed herself.
I haven't changed a bit.
Ellen...
Yes, Dad?
I thought tonight it might do us both good to...
The Vincents said something about the ballet.
I'm going with Bud.
He's picking me up at 7:00.
When does that young man get his studying done?
You might have asked the same thing of me.
As a matter of fact, he's a very good student.
And I like him very much.
That's fine.
I'm glad.
- Kingship's residence.
- Your Lupton call.
Right here. Your call to Lupton, Miss Ellen.
Thank you, Mary.
Hello?
Miss Kingship.
It's nice to hear you again.
You once offered a helping hand, Mr. Grant.
I'm taking you at your word.
That's the idea.
You name it, and I'll try and do it.
And I'd rather discuss it with you in person, not over a phone.
To tell you the truth,
I'd prefer that myself.
Tomorrow afternoon?
I could leave here in the morning... and be there about...
Wait a minute. I think we've hit a snag.
I have to be in Deming tomorrow.
I promised to give a lecture at the teachers' college.
How about the day after?
Could you meet me in the lobby of the San Carlos Hotel?
Say 8:00?
- Tonight?
- Yes.
I'll try for the first plane out of here.
I promise not to hold you up.
I just don't want to lose two days.
Please? I'd appreciate it very much.
All right, I'll be there.
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
Mary?
Will you get my pink cotton dress for me?
And an overnight bag.
But I'm getting things ready for tonight.
I have to cancel that.
And I want you to deliver a message to Mr. Corliss when he calls for me.
There's no way I can reach him now.
Tell him something important has come up about Dorothy... some new information... and I'm having to leave for Lupton now to talk to the police.
Ask him to forgive me.
Tell him I'll call him the minute I get back.
I'll tell him, Miss Ellen.
Airport?
Reservations desk, please.
Then, just before I called you...
I remembered something that happened two days before she died.
I mailed her gloves to her.
She'd had them a long time and was fond of them.
- But those she wore the day she died...
- I know. They were ruined.
They were brand-new.
Don't you even begin to see?
I guess we'll just have to face it.
You're talking to a pretty stupid man.
Brand-new gloves, a borrowed belt... a blue handkerchief, an old blouse.
"Something old, something new
"Something borrowed, something blue"
Where's the Marriage License Bureau?
In the Municipal Building.
I think Dorothy went there to get married and not to kill herself.
To go a step further, Mr. Grant,
I don't think she did kill herself.
- And the suicide note?
- Where did it say suicide?
"I hope you will forgive me for the unhappiness I'll cause.
"There is nothing else I can do."
Her marriage would've made my father unhappy.
But as we know now, what else could she do?
If we can identify her boyfriend,
I think you'll find I'm right.
And I've done some thinking about him, too.
Dorothy wrote me when the semester began.
Said she met someone, in English Literature, I believe... who was the real thing.
- She didn't mention his name, but...
- Ellen...
You've really been thinking about this, haven't you?
I mean, you've done a lot of thinking.
Brooding, my father calls it.
You can call it that, too. I'm not sensitive.
I know that when tragedy hits hard... the mind is apt to come up with a lot of far-fetched ideas.
Like this? In other words, you don't believe me.
- I didn't say that.
- What about your uncle? Would he?
If you think I like imagination, you ought to have a session with him.
Thanks very much anyway, Mr. Grant.
Gordon.
Look...
Let me tell you a little more about my uncle.
If your sister was murdered... he wants to know about it as much as you do, and so do I.
I'll admit, there wasn't much of any kind of investigation... but frankly, at that time, there wasn't a need for one.
All right. Let's say there is now.
- Let's say we at least check into it, okay?
- Then you will help?
You got yourself a date for the day after tomorrow morning.
That's when I'll be back.
And this student lent my sister a fairly large sum of money.
The trouble is, we can't find any record that she ever repaid him.
And he's evidently felt awkward about reclaiming it.
I understand.
What makes us feel awkward, we don't know who he is... just that he's tall and slender and was in her English class.
I thought if you'd let me look at the records...
But that was two semesters ago.
- He may not even be here now.
- If I can name him, I can find him.
I'll have you talk with our Registrar.
She might be able to help you.
Harvey Levitch, 5' 3", 164.
Roy Dublin, 5' 8", 151.
Mr. Dublin wears glasses, a bohemian-type, sloppy clothes and such.
Dwight Powell, 6' 1", 174.
Very good-looking, dark-haired, polished, a speech major.
Speech?
Dorothy said he had a tape recorder.
They were going to send me a birthday message and never got to it.
Do you have an address?
This one is scratched out.
He must have moved.
Watkins dorm. He moved in last semester.
It might be easier to reach him at KBRI.
He runs a disc-jockey show at night.
- Where is that?
- Municipal Building, top floor.
Thank you. You've been very helpful.
Dwight Powell, please.
Is this Dwight Powell?
I know what you did to Dory.
I know all about it.
Dory Kingship. You know very well who I mean.
Meet me at the Esquire Club, 11:00.
I'll tell you what I want.
What are you doing down there?
Get away from here, you!
Don't touch me.
Let me go. The police know I'm here.
- What are you talking about?
- Let me go.
Not till you tell me what this is about.
Did you phone me?
Take your hands off me!
Look, I'm Dwight Powell.
Who are you?
Let's go someplace where there are people around.
Anyplace.
Tell me what this is all about.
You go first.
You did know her.
Sure, I went with her.
I met her in English Lit.
I liked her a lot, but she started knitting socks for me.
I figured it was time to check out, and I did.
Look, if I was a murderer... do you think I'd let you out of that alley?
Please don't talk so loud.
All I know is you went for the bait.
You must have had some reason.
- Well, you...
- Not just to check on a crank phone call.
All right.
Listen. The fact is,
I thought your sister might have...
I thought she might have killed herself because I stopped going with her.
I know it sounds ridiculous, conceited, anything you want to call it.
Anyhow, it's bothered me.
Maybe I've been a disc jockey for too long, too many fan letters from kids.
And just spinning too many records.
All right, I apologize.
- So what was that bit about the police?
- They don't know about it.
You mean, you did this on your own?
I had to.
The man I would have called just wasn't available.
- That was a real crazy chance, lady.
- You weren't supposed to see me.
All you had to do was show up.
That would tell me you knew Dorothy, felt some guilt.
I'd have let the police take it from there.
I'll tell you what, next time you let the police start it.
You called her Dory over the phone.
- What is that, a family name?
- You never called her that?
I knew who you meant when you said Kingship, but never heard anyone call her Dory.
Somebody did. She mentioned it in her letter.
Could've been after we broke off.
She went with another guy.
Who? What's his name?
I don't know. Some guy she met on campus.
I never saw him.
Wait a minute.
I can find out easy enough, though.
- I've got his address at home.
- You do?
A couple of weeks after we broke off... she called, invited me to a party at her boyfriend's house.
I figured she wanted to show me, so I didn't go... but I wrote his address in my notebook.
All right, let's get it.
Come on. Hold it.
What are you going to do with it?
Don't worry. I've learned my lesson.
I'll take it to the police, first thing in the morning.
Come on.
It's all right. Most of the fellows are out.
At the auditorium, seeing last year's football photos.
I'll only be a minute.
Put it down, Dwight.
What are you gonna do?
Turn up the roller.
- No.
- Sit down.
Please.
- You can have the address book.
- Face the typewriter.
I'll tell her I couldn't find it.
I'll forget I ever saw you.
Turn around.
- Please.
- Hold steady.
Pretty simple.
Powell pushed the Kingship girl off the roof, pressure got too great for him.
Suicide note's still in the typewriter, if you want to take a look.
Case opened again, closed again.
But for good this time.
He actually had me believing him.
Dorothy believed him, too.
Must run in the family.
I was going to ask.
Would you like me to phone your father, tell him about this?
Thanks. I'll phone him myself tonight.
Anything you'd care to say about the local police, you'd be right.
You did it all.
And the terrible thing is that if I'd known you were doing it...
I'd have stopped you.
Take Miss Kingship to her hotel.
Thank you.
Thank you, Brad.
Bill.
Ellen.
Hello, Dad.
You're all right?
Better.
Much better.
And you?
If you're better, I'm fine.
By the way, there's somebody waiting for you.
Bud?
In there.
Bud?
Hi, Ellen. How are you?
- Just fine.
- Good.
- The winner.
- It's a fixed race.
They're Kingship horses.
They do what you tell them to.
After Dad tells them it's okay.
You know, I think he'd do it, too, for you.
He has changed lately.
Then, maybe I have, too.
- I have something to do with it?
- Something?
No.
Everything.
I had to say it, because you wanted me to.
Your diabolic spell.
Not at all.
Our relationship is a simple matter of chemistry.
Like attracts like.
Happens with minerals. Happens with people.
Basic formula.
People who like the same things, like each other.
I was saying that to somebody just the other day.
Really is uncanny.
Same taste in books and music...
And jokes. Don't forget jokes.
No good if you don't laugh at the same things.
No good if you don't know what the other one's thinking.
I thought the chemistry took care of that.
What I'm thinking about goes back before that... something about me you don't know.
- A dark past? How exciting.
- It is.
I'm a man with a shameful, sinister secret.
You know what it is?
I've never really been in love before.
Bud...
If this is going to embarrass you or upset you in any way...
- It doesn't.
- If it does, we'll get a new formula and start again.
- I just want to tell you...
- Can't you wait?
I'm sorry.
Because I can wait.
I think that's what I really wanted to tell you.
I'll wait.
I'll wait until you fall in love with me.
I'll even wait until you tell me to stop waiting... that it's useless, that it hasn't any point.
I can tell you that now.
There isn't a point in either of us waiting any longer.
I don't want to.
The formula's still working, you know?
I'm in love, too... for the very first time in my life... with you.
Thirty-two rooms, Mother.
- You think...
- He'll get it.
Wait'll you see the swimming pool.
That where they'll announce the engagement?
Not in the pool, but around it, probably the terrace.
Now, don't worry.
They'll love you. You'll see.
What is it?
That blouse, why did you wear a thing like that?
I told you the kind of people that would be here.
- I thought you'd like it.
- It's too late now.
Mrs. Corliss, how perfectly lovely you look.
Why, thank you, Ellen.
Thank you very much.
I hope you'll find your room comfortable.
We've put you near Bud.
Miss Ellen, the florist is still waiting.
- Okay.
- Go on. You tend to your party.
I'll take Mother upstairs.
Excuse me.
I'm not worried about the caviar.
Just be sure there's enough champagne.
- But all the florist wanted was your opinion.
- Is Miss Kingship at home?
- She is.
- Gordon.
Hello, Ellen. How are you?
You think you have troubles.
Where are those parking boys I ordered?
I certainly picked a swell time to call, didn't I?
A hectic last minute, but the perfect day.
It's all to show off this.
That's a pretty ring.
Congratulations.
Now I know I picked the wrong time.
Suppose I give you a call sometime tomorrow or the next day.
Don't you dare go.
Honestly, I think my business is just a little out of tune... with your festivities. It can wait.
If you think I'm going to spend the afternoon wondering...
That's all I need.
Can you spare a minute?
Sure. Come in.
If I can spare a minute, so can you.
It concerns your sister's friend.
You know, the late disc jockey,
Dwight Powell.
Seems that he was quite a tennis player, too.
You know, I helped my uncle wrap up that case.
I made the usual inquiries to fill out the record.
There's one interesting fact that just came straggling in.
It seems that on the day your sister died...
Dwight Powell was playing tennis in a tournament in Mexico City.
He'd been there almost a week.
I don't believe it.
You'll have to.
His teammates dug up a news picture.
There he was.
And there was the date.
If he wasn't in Lupton, he couldn't have killed her.
- If he didn't kill her, why kill himself?
- That's it.
So instead of murder and a suicide, we have something else.
Two murders.
Do you want to go a step further?
- The man who killed Dorothy is still free.
- That's right.
I guess the next time I say I'd better go... you'd better let me.
Actually, I gambled.
I thought I saw enough happiness there to override most anything.
Anyway, as far as I'm concerned, the case is just starting.
I'll keep you posted.
You're not leaving.
I have to. I think my minute's just about up.
I want you to meet somebody.
- Miss Ellen, I hate to bother you...
- Later, Bill.
This is the one, Gordon.
- Bud Corliss, Gordon Grant.
- How do you do?
How are you, Bud? Congratulations.
I've heard about you for quite some time.
In a certain amount of detail.
I don't believe we've met. Are you from here?
- No, I'm from Lupton.
- Lupton?
You beat all the local guests to the party?
I'd say that rates some kind of reward.
I'm not exactly that kind of guest, actually.
I'm unexpected, unprepared and just on my way out.
I really do have to go.
Gordon just dropped by to give me a message.
- And to wish you both lots of happiness.
- Thank you very much.
Nice meeting you, Bud.
I'll be in touch, Ellen.
Mr. Kingship's office called.
Your father's on his way.
Thank heaven.
Now you can take your problems to him and give me a chance to get ready.
He's a nice fellow.
- Have you known him long?
- I met him because of Dorothy.
- He knew her at the university.
- That probably explains it.
I had a feeling something upset you.
On a day like this,
I'm not going to be upset by anything.
And I'm not going to let you be.
- I really must hurry now.
- Darling...
You know that whatever concerns you, concerns me.
That works both ways.
You'd better hurry, too, if you're going to change.
- Would you fill her up with ethyl, please?
- Right.
Hello, operator? Long distance.
I want to put in a collect call to Chief of Police Howard Chesser in Lupton.
Right.
My name is Gordon Grant.
Would you check the oil? I think it's a little low.
Right.
Hello, Charlie?
Is Uncle Howard there?
Put in about a 30-weight, too, and check that left rear tire.
Hello, Howard? This is Gordon.
I just saw her.
And I just met the guy she's going to marry, too.
What I wanted to tell you was that I think I've seen him before.
There at the university.
I'll tell you the point.
The point is that
I think I've seen him with Dorothy Kingship.
His name is Bud Corliss.
That's right. C-O-R-L-I-S-S.
Now, look, let's be sure.
You call the Registrar's Office and check with her. Right.
And then call me back.
All right. I'll wait around for an answer.
I'll be at the Chaplain Hotel.
You fellows in aluminum are just as badly off as we are.
No more for me, thanks.
I can see the look in my wife's eye.
- We have to be leaving, too.
- So soon?
- Will you excuse me?
- Certainly, Bud.
- Congratulations, nice to have met you.
- Thank you, Mr. Cratchet. Mr. Fairburn.
- Leo, you did all right. He's a fine boy.
- Thank you.
There's a Mr. Grant to see you.
He says it's important.
- Excuse me, please.
- I hope we can see you later.
Right.
- How are you today?
- Mr. Kingship.
When is it going to be, dear?
This Sunday, if we can clear the church.
They just didn't want to wait. I don't know.
Children seem so impatient these days.
I know in my time...
Shall I tell them about your time?
Better yet, shall I tell them about you?
Bud, that isn't fair.
Mother eloped.
No waiting at all.
Did he tell you he went to the state university?
That's a simple question.
Simple and preposterous, your whole implication.
I take it he didn't tell you.
- Why should he?
- Why wouldn't he?
Fellow engaged to one daughter not mentioning he knew the other.
Knew her?
I wasn't aware your uncle discovered that.
No, that part came from me.
But he's checking on it now.
In other words, you had the gall... to come here now, on an occasion like this, with no proof at all. Why?
To find out whether you knew that Bud Corliss knew Dorothy.
Of course he didn't.
- How do you know?
- Because he would have said so.
Thank you, sir.
That's all I wanted to hear you say.
Because if he did know her and didn't mention it... he must have had a reason.
Unless, of course, he told Ellen and happened to bypass you.
We can certainly check on that.
- What do you mean?
- Ask her.
- No.
- Why not?
It's unthinkable, the whole thing.
- I know that boy.
- For how long?
- It's degrading to ask her a thing like that.
- The police don't see it that way.
I'm not the police, Mr. Grant.
I'm her father.
Then for that very reason, please give it more serious consideration.
Mr. Grant...
Up until recently, Ellen and I have...
She's under the impression that I'm trying to run her life.
I can't do it.
I won't do it.
If you won't... then I'll have to do it for you.
Gordon, you didn't have to get back after all.
I'm so glad.
I came looking for Dad to tell him everyone was leaving.
I see.
You've told him about Powell.
Don't you think you should've let me do that?
Did you know that Bud knew Dorothy?
- Why are you asking me that?
- Did you? Did Bud ever tell you?
I want to know why you're asking such a question.
I started it. I recognized Bud when you introduced us.
It would've been a good time to say we went to the same university... but you didn't, because you didn't know.
- I didn't because it wasn't so.
- No.
Because he didn't tell you.
If he started this, how eager you must have been to join him.
How you must have searched for just such a lie.
You ruined Dorothy's life... and my mother's.
And now you want to do the same for me.
It won't work.
Don't ever mention this to me again, not any part of it... not ever.
I'm sorry, Mr. Kingship... but I'll see you again, sir.
Either to apologize humbly for being wrong... or else to prove that I was right.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye, and thanks again.
- It was a pleasure meeting you.
- Thank you. Goodbye.
That was the last.
It was a wonderful party, a real ball.
The things people do when they see happiness.
Did you notice that, too?
They left here glowing like Christmas trees.
I wonder if your father's gonna glow when he gets the bill.
- Think we're worth it?
- A thousand times over.
I'm gonna have to give you some lessons on economy.
- Do you want to go to dinner?
- Don't even mention it.
How about a show?
To tell you the truth, darling,
I'm absolutely exhausted all at once.
If you want to be early to the smelter tomorrow, you better let me go tonight.
All right, off to bed with you then.
And pleasant dreams. Good night, darling.
The Kingship Mines.
- Larger, you thought, or smaller?
- No complaints.
This is your call, sir.
Good. It's from the restaurant on the outskirts of town.
I'd like you to take it if you don't mind.
- Kingship speaking.
- This is the confirmation on it.
Corliss was Dorothy's boyfriend, all right.
The waitress says they came here often for weeks before she died.
I see.
I'll call the Payson police and have him picked up right away.
Yes.
Thank you, Chief.
Tell Miss Ellen I want to see her at once.
She's not at home.
She and Mr. Corliss drove out to the smelter.
Thank you.
Yes, sir.
There's no danger of anything happening to her up there.
Why, he doesn't even know we suspect him.
Ellen does.
- I'll have the car brought around right away.
- Good.
I'll phone the police, tell them where we're going.
$2 million on wheels.
Hard to believe, isn't it,
$50,000 for a truck?
Of course, we get a slight discount buying them by the gross.
Looks like the center of creation.
At the rate they're going, they'll be in China for Easter Sunday.
They've been working this pit eight years.
Seven.
Darling, you sound like you knew the Kingship Mine... long before the Kingship girl.
It's not that.
It's just that mining of any kind has always interested me... ever since I can remember.
Like you said, two of a kind.
Opera, music...
You should have heard Dorothy on the subject of Debussy and me.
I used to drag that girl to every concert.
I tried to see most of them, too.
Shall we go up?
- How were the concerts in Lupton?
- Not bad for a town that...
That was some time ago.
They're probably even better today.
Look at that.
I've seen it.
I think we'd better be getting back now.
I can't go on like this.
I've got to know.
- You mean about Lupton?
- Yes.
Did I go to the university?
Did I know your sister?
I did.
I even had a few dates with her.
Why didn't you tell me?
All right, I will.
When I transferred up here and happened to meet you...
I saw right away what you were going through.
By telling you, would that have helped you forget?
- But later...
- Later.
Later we fell in love... and I knew I mustn't tell you.
I'd be chaining you to a constant reminder of grief every time you looked at me.
I'd be putting a curse on both of us.
- I suppose that I should have...
- I still don't understand.
- If it was only innocent, you...
- What did you say?
If it was innocent? If it was?
- I didn't mean that...
- Is that what your love is like?
Is that a sample of your faith in me, your trust?
Please wait.
Who put you up to this? Grant?
He probably saw me with her once.
What an operator.
He drives all the way up here to tell you that.
It was to tell me about Powell.
- The fellow who killed your sister?
- Except that he didn't.
He didn't kill himself.
He was killed by the same man who killed Dorothy.
How do they know such a thing?
They're bluffing.
He left a note. It said it all there.
They didn't find anybody.
How do they even know your sister was killed?
They're guessing.
Powell was about to give me the murderer's address.
The murderer knew that.
He overheard us in that bar.
He just happened to be there?
He didn't just happen to be there.
He'd followed me.
He followed me since I'd arrived in town.
That's even crazier. How could he?
Known I was in Lupton?
I sent him a message telling him so.
Remember?
You think you know.
I'm telling you you're wrong.
These things are coincidence, one after another.
Me knowing her, the university.
So did a hundred other guys.
You're tall and slender.
- That was in her letter.
- What letter?
- Right beside me all along.
- What does it mean? Nothing.
- Dory knew a dozen...
- Dory.
There weren't a dozen called her Dory.
There was only one.
Why did you have to do this?
To me, to yourself?
Most of these things you've said, the police don't even know.
They do.
No.
They don't.
Or I wouldn't be here, would I?
And you wouldn't be here with me.
I put my whole life into this, everything I ever wanted, right here.
I can't give it up.
You're insane.
Can't you see that?
You can't go any further.
Your father and I, we'll grieve together.
We'll have that to share between us, too.
Let me go!
There.
Okay, let's go.
Let me get you another drink.
Mark, before Tony comes...
I ought to explain something.
Yes, I've been waiting for that.
I haven't told him anything about us.
That's not surprising.
It's a tough thing to do.
When you telephoned this morning...
I simply said you wrote crime stories... and I'd met you once when you were here before.
That has a pretty guilty ring to it.
I'd never use it in one of my stories.
Mark, I know you think it's silly, but when you get to know Tony... you'll understand why I said that.
Darling, I understand now but that doesn't stop me from loving you.
It's not as simple as that.
Tony's changed.
Thanks.
He's a completely different person to the one I used to tell you about.
Really? When did all this happen?
That night I came to say goodbye.
When I left your apartment,
I came back here.
I sat down on the sofa and had a good cry.
And then I fell asleep.
And when I woke up, there was Tony standing in the hall... with all his bags and tennis rackets.
He just said he decided to give up tennis and settle down to a job.
- Just like that?
- Just like that.
Of course I didn't believe him at first, but he meant it all right.
But he's been wonderful ever since.
I suppose that's when you stopped writing me?
Margot, is it?
Do you remember the letters you wrote to me?
Yes, I remember.
After I read them, I burned them.
I thought it best.
All except one.
You probably know the one I mean.
Yes, I think I do. What about it?
It was stolen.
One day Tony and I were going to spend the weekend in the country with friends.
While we were waiting on the platform,
I noticed my handbag was missing... and the letter was inside.
Where was this?
Victoria Station.
I thought I left it in the restaurant... but when I went back to look, it had gone.
You mean you never found it?
I recovered the handbag about two weeks later... from the lost and found, but the letter wasn't there.
And then about a week afterwards,
I received a note.
It told me what I had to do to get the letter back.
Yes. Go ahead. Go on.
I was to draw £50 from my bank in £5 notes... and then change them for used £1 notes.
It said that if I went to the police or told anyone else... he would show the letter to my husband.
You still have the note?
Printed, all capitals.
Anyone could have done this.
And two days later, I got this one.
Both mailed in Brixton.
"Tie up the money in a package... and mail to John S. King,
23 Newport Street, Brixton SW 9.
You'll get your letter by return."
It's a little shop.
People use it as a forwarding address.
You didn't mail the money?
- Yes, but the letter was never returned.
- Margot.
So after waiting about two weeks,
I went there.
Said they'd never heard of a man by that name.
And the parcel was still there, it had never been opened.
Well, that's something, I suppose.
May I keep these?
Yes, if you like.
I can't understand why you didn't tell me.
There wasn't anything you could do.
You probably would've made me tell Tony and the police.
As it was only £50,
I thought I'd pay up and have done with it.
Margot, I better tell Tony about us tonight.
No, Mark, please, you mustn't.
You don't understand.
Tony's changed. Please.
I wish it was a year ago when you came to say goodbye.
We were in the kitchen. I nearly said,
"I can't go through with this.
Let's find Tony and tell him all about it."
I believe you'd have done it then.
Well, I can see this is gonna be a rough evening.
All of us saying nice things to each other.
Look, there's only one thing you haven't explained.
Why didn't you burn that letter too?
There you are.
We thought you were never coming.
What have you been up to?
Oh, I'm sorry, but the boss blew in just as I was leaving.
Tony, this is Mark Halliday.
- Hello, Mark.
- Tony, hello.
I'm terribly sorry to be so late.
How do you like it over here?
Oh, fine. Just fine, Tony.
Is this your first visit to London?
No, no. I was here a year ago for a vacation.
Oh, yes, that's right.
Margot told me.
You, uh....
You write for the radio, don't you?
- No, television, for my sins.
- Darling, did you reserve a table?
- Yes, 7:00.
- Well, come on then--
Oh, darling, a slight alteration in plans.
- Oh, now don't say you can't go.
- I'm afraid so.
Old man Burgess is flying to Brussels on Sunday... and I have to get my monthly report in by tomorrow.
Well, can't you do it when we get back?
I'm afraid not. It'll take hours.
I shall have to fake half of it as it is.
But....
Could you join us after the theater?
We might go somewhere.
Why don't you give me a ring at intermission?
If I'm inspired, I might make it.
- Well, do try.
- All right.
I'll just get my things, Mark.
- Oh, here are the tickets.
- Oh, thanks, Tony.
I'm afraid this is terribly rude of me.
Not at all.
I'm just sorry you can't come.
You must come to dinner.
- Thanks, I'd like that.
- By the way...
- what are you doing tomorrow night?
- Saturday? Nothing I know of.
- How'd you like to come to a stag party?
- A stag party?
Yes. Some American boys have been playing tennis all over.
We're giving them a sort of farewell dinner.
Well, I'm not much of a tennis player.
That doesn't matter.
You know New York and all that.
- Mark's coming to the party tomorrow.
- Oh, good.
Well, you better drop in here first and have a drink.
- That's the idea.
- Yes. All right. I'll try and get a taxi.
Oh, no. We can usually pick one up.
So long, darling.
Enjoy yourself.
- So long, Tony.
- Good night.
Oh, Mark?
Yes?
Sell the extra ticket.
Have a drink on the proceeds.
- All right, Tony, we'll try.
- Have a good time.
Thanks. Night.
- Hello.
- Hello. Hampstead 7899?
- Yes.
- Could I speak to Captain Lesgate?
Speaking.
Oh, good evening. You don't know me.
My name is Fisher.
I understand you have a car for sale.
Oh, yes, an American car.
Yes, I saw it at your garage.
How much are you asking?
- Eleven hundred.
- Eleven hundred, I see.
Well, it certainly looks just the job for me.
But I don't like that price.
Well, I didn't like it when I bought it.
Now, when can we meet? 
Well, now, how about tomorrow afternoon?
I'm afraid I can't manage that.
Uh, no, I can't, and I'm going to Liverpool on Sunday.
I was rather hoping....
I say, you couldn't come around to my flat tonight?
- Where is it?
- Maida Vale.
I'd call on you, only I've twisted my knee rather badly.
Oh, I'm sorry. Well, what's your address?
61-A Charrington Gardens.
- Harrington? Oh.
- Oh, no, no. Charrington.
Turn left at the underground.
It's about a two minutes' walk.
I'll be there in about an hour.
That's extremely good of you.
Oh, by the way, will you be bringing the car?
Oh, I'm afraid I can't--
Well, that doesn't matter.
I had a good look at it.
As you might bring the registration book and any necessary papers.
Yes, of course.
I don't see why we couldn't settle this thing here... provided you drop the price sufficiently.
Oh, I'm afraid that's out of the question.
Well, we'll see what a couple of drinks can do.
Uh, goodbye.
Goodbye.
- Mr. Fisher?
- Yes. Captain Lesgate?
- Yes.
- Won't you come in?
Thank you.
It's very good of you.
Let me have your coat.
- Have any difficulty finding your way?
- No. None at all.
Do sit down. How about a drink?
You know, I can't help thinking
I've seen you before somewhere.
You know, it's funny you should mention that.
The moment I opened the door, I....
Wait a minute. Lesgate?
You're not Lesgate. Swann.
C.J. Swann. Or was it C.A?
C.A. Well, you've got a better memory than I have.
Fisher. When did we meet?
- Weren't you at Cambridge?
- Yes.
Must be 20 years ago.
You wouldn't remember me.
I only came your last year.
Well, what a coincidence.
Yes, this calls for a special drink.
I was planning to palm you off with an indifferent port... but let's see what we have here.
How about this?
Perfect.
By the way, how do you know my car's for sale?
Your garage told me.
That's odd. I didn't mention it to anyone.
I was stopping for a fill-up and I told them I was looking for a car.
They gave me your phone number.
I say, it is for sale, isn't it?
- Well, of course.
- Good. I refuse to discuss the price... until you've had three brandies.
Well, I warn you, I drive a hard bargain, drunk or sober.
So do I.
You know, I think I must have seen you somewhere since we left Cambridge.
Ever been to Wimbledon?
That's it. Wendice. Tony Wendice.
What's all this about Fisher?
What's all this about Lesgate?
Would you like a cigar?
No, thanks. I'll just stick to my pipe.
That's one habit you've changed.
- Oh?
- I remember, at college... you always used to smoke rather expensive cigars.
Wait a minute, I think
I have a picture of you here somewhere.
Yes.
Yes. Here's one... taken at a reunion dinner.
There you are.
With the biggest cigar in the business.
Well, that's the first and last reunion
I ever went to.
What a murderous thug I look.
Yes, you do, rather.
Of course I always remember you because of the college ball.
You were the treasurer, weren't you?
Honorary treasurer.
I used to organize the beastly things.
Yes. Some of the ticket money was stolen...
- wasn't it?
- That's right. Almost £100.
I'd left it in a cashbox in my study and in the morning it had gone.
It was the college porter, of course.
Yes, of course. Poor old Alfred.
He never could back a winner.
They found the cashbox in his back garden.
But not the money.
Twenty years ago.
What are you doing nowadays?
I deal in property.
I say, I don't follow tennis closely.
Do you still play?
No, I've given up tennis, or rather, tennis gave me up.
One has to earn a living sometime, and I had a good run for my money.
Went round the world three times.
- What are you doing now?
- I sell sports equipment.
It's not very lucrative, but it gives me plenty of spare time.
Well, I see you manage to run a very comfortable place.
My wife has some money of her own.
Otherwise, I should hardly feel like blowing £1000 on your car.
You know, people with capital don't realize how lucky they are.
I'm almost resigned to living on what I can earn.
Well, you can always marry for money.
I suppose some people make a business out of that.
- I know I did.
- Why do you think she married you?
Well, I was a tennis star.
You've given up tennis.
She hasn't left you.
She nearly did.
After we married, I played... in championships and took Margot with me.
She didn't like it much, and when we got back... she tried to make me give up tennis and play husband instead.
In the end, we compromised.
I went alone to America for the grass-court season... and returned after the national championships.
I soon realized that a lot had happened while I was away.
For one thing, she wasn't in love with me anymore.
There were phone calls which would end abruptly if I happened to walk in.
There was an old school friend used to visit from time to time.
One day we had a row. I wanted to play in the covered-court tournament... and as usual, she didn't want me to go.
I was in the bedroom. The phone rang.
It all sounded pretty urgent.
After that, she seemed keen that I play in the tournament after all.
So I packed my kit into the car and drove off.
I parked the car two streets away, walked back in my tracks.
Ten minutes later, she came out of this house and took a taxi.
I took another.
Her old school friend lived in a studio in Chelsea.
I could see them through the studio window... as he cooked spaghetti over a gas ring.
They didn't say much.
They just looked very natural together.
You know, it's funny how you can tell when people are in love.
I went for a walk.
I began to wonder what would happen if she left me.
I'd have to find some way of earning a living to begin with.
I suddenly realized how much I'd grown to depend on her.
All these expensive tastes I'd acquired while I was at the top.
And now big tennis had finished with me, and so apparently had my wife.
I can't ever remember being so scared.
I dropped into a pub and had a couple of drinks.
As I sat in the corner,
I thought of all sorts of things.
I thought of three different ways of killing him.
I even thought of killing her.
That seemed a far more sensible idea.
And just as I was working out how I could do it,
I suddenly saw something... which completely changed my mind.
I didn't go to that tournament after all.
When I got back, she was sitting exactly where you are now.
And I told her I decided to give up tennis and look after her instead.
Well?
Well, as things turned out,
I needn't have got so worked up after all.
Apparently that spaghetti evening had been a sort of a fond farewell.
The boyfriend had been called back to New York.
- Ah, an American?
- Yes.
There were long letters from there.
They usually arrived on Thursdays.
And she burned them all except one.
That one she used to transfer from handbag to handbag.
It was always with her.
That letter became an obsession with me.
I had to find out what was in it.
And finally I did.
That letter made very interesting reading.
- Do you mean you stole it?
- Yes.
I even wrote her two anonymous notes offering to sell it back.
Why?
I was hoping it would make her come and tell me all about him... but it didn't.
So I kept the letter.
Why are you telling me all this?
Because you're the only person
I can trust.
Anyway, that did it.
It must have put the fear of God into them... because the letters stopped... and we lived happily ever after.
It was funny to think that just a year ago...
I sat in that Knightsbridge pub actually planning to murder her.
And I might have done it... if I hadn't seen something that changed my mind.
Well? What did you see?
I saw you.
What was so odd about that?
The coincidence.
Only a week before,
I'd been to a reunion dinner... and the fellas were talking about you.
How you'd been court-martialed during the war, a year in prison.
That was news.
Mind you, at college, we'd all said that old Swann would end up in jail.
That cashbox, I suppose.
Well, what about it?
Oh, my dear fellow, everybody knew you took that money.
Poor old Alfred.
Thanks very much for the drink.
Interesting, hearing about your matrimonial affairs.
I take it you won't be wanting that car after all.
Don't you want me to tell you why I brought you here?
Yes, I think you'd better.
It was when I saw you in that pub that it happened.
Suddenly everything became quite clear.
Only a few months before,
Margot and I had made our wills... quite short affairs... leaving everything we had to each other in case of accidents.
Hers worked out at just over £90,000.
Investments mostly.
All a little too easy to get at.
And that was dangerous as they'd be bound to suspect me.
I needed an alibi, a very good one.
Then I saw you.
I often wondered what happened to people when they came out of prison.
People like you, I mean.
Can they get jobs?
Do old friends rally round?
Suppose they'd never had any friends.
I became so curious to know that I followed you.
I followed you home that night.
And-- Would you mind passing me your glass, old boy?
Thank you. Thank you very much.
And I've been following you ever since.
Why?
I was hoping that sooner or later
I might catch you at something... and be able to, uh....
- Blackmail me?
- Influence you.
After a couple of weeks,
I got to know your routine... and that made it a lot easier.
- Rather dour work.
- To begin with, yes.
But you know how it is.
You take up a hobby... and the more you get to know it, the more fascinating it becomes.
You became quite fascinating.
In fact, there were times when I felt that you almost belonged to me.
That must have been interesting.
You used to go to the dog racing
Mondays and Thursdays.
I even took it up myself, just to be near you.
You'd changed your name to Adams.
Yes. I got bored with Swann.
Any crime in that?
No, no. None whatever.
In fact, there was nothing really illegal about you.
I got quite discouraged.
Then one day, you disappeared from your lodgings.
I phoned your landlady.
I said Mr. Adams owed me £5.
But apparently that was nothing.
Mr. Adams owed her six weeks' rent and her best lodger £55.
And Mr. Adams had been such a nice gentleman.
That's what seemed to upset her most.
Yes. That always seems to upset them most.
I say, old boy, if you want another drink... do you mind putting on these gloves?
Now, where were we?
Oh, yes, I'd lost you... and then I found you one day at the dog racing.
And I tailed you home to your new lodgings in Belsize Park.
There Mr. Adams became Mr. Wilson.
Mr. Wilson left Belsize Park owing 16 weeks' rent... and somewhat richer for a brief encounter with a Miss Wallace.
You used to take Miss Wallace out on Wednesdays and Sundays.
She certainly was in love with you, wasn't she?
I suppose she thought you were growing that handsome mustache to please her.
Poor Miss Wallace.
This is all very interesting.
Do go on.
July, August, September.
Apartment 127, Carlisle Court.
Occupant, a Mrs. Van Dorn.
Her late husband left her two hotels and a large apartment house, furnished.
What a base to operate from, Captain Lesgate.
The only trouble is, she does rather enjoy being courted... and she's so very expensive.
Perhaps that's why you've been trying to sell her car for over a month.
Mrs. Van Dorn asked me to sell it for her.
I know. I called her up just before you arrived here.
She only wanted 800.
Where's the nearest police station?
Opposite the church. Two minutes' walk.
- Suppose I walk there now.
- What would you tell them?
Everything.
Everything?
All about Mr. Adams and Mr. Wilson?
I should simply tell them that you're trying to blackmail me into--
Into?
Murdering your wife.
I almost wish you would.
When she heard that... we'd have the biggest laugh of our lives.
- Aren't you forgetting something?
- Am I?
- You've told me quite a lot tonight.
- What of it?
Suppose I tell them how you followed her to that studio in Chelsea... and watched them cooking spaghetti, and all that rubbish?
- Will that ring a bell?
- Oh, it certainly would.
They'd assume you followed her yourself.
- Me? Why should I?
- Why should you steal her handbag?
Why should you write her all those blackmail notes?
Can you prove you didn't?
You certainly can't prove I did.
It'd be a straight case of your word against mine.
That would puzzle them, wouldn't it?
What could you say?
I shall simply say that you came here tonight half-drunk... and, uh, tried to borrow money... on the strength that we were at college together.
When I refused, you mentioned something... about a letter belonging to my wife.
As far as I could make out, you tried to sell it to me.
I gave you what money I had and you gave me the letter.
It has your fingerprints on it, remember?
Then you said if I went to the police... you'd tell some crazy story about my wanting you to murder my wife.
But before you go any further, old boy, do consider the inconvenience.
You see, I'm quite well-known.
And there'd be pictures of you as well.
And sooner or later, there'd be a deputation of landladies and lodgers... who would step forward to testify to your character.
And someone is almost certain to have seen you with Miss Wallace.
You were careful not to be seen around with her, I noticed.
You usually met in out-of-the-way places where you wouldn't be recognized... like the little tea shop in Pimlico.
That was her idea, not mine.
Yes, it was a bit crummy, wasn't it?
Hardly the place to take Mrs. Van Dorn.
By the way, does Mrs. Van Dorn know about Mr. Adams and Mr. Wilson... and Miss Wallace?
You were planning to marry Mrs. Van Dorn, weren't you?
- Smart, aren't you?
- No, not really.
I've just had time to think things out, put myself in your position.
That's why I know you're going to agree.
What makes you think I'll agree?
For the same reason that a donkey with a stick behind him and a carrot in front... always goes forwards and not backwards.
- Tell me about the carrot.
- One thousand pounds in cash.
For a murder?
For a few minutes' work, that's all it is.
And no risk, I guarantee.
That ought to appeal to you.
You've been skating on pretty thin ice.
I don't know what you're talking about.
You ought to know.
It was in all the papers.
Middle-aged woman found dead due to an overdose of something.
She had been taking the stuff for quite some time... and nobody knows where she got it.
But we know, don't we?
Poor Miss Wallace.
This £1000. Where is it?
It's in a small attaché case in a checkroom.
Where?
Somewhere in London.
Of course we don't meet again.
As soon as you've delivered the goods...
I shall mail you the checkroom ticket and the key to the case.
You can take this £100 on account.
The police would only have to trace one of these notes back to you... to hang us both from the same rope.
They won't.
For a whole year,
I've been cashing an extra £20 a week.
Always in fivers.
I then change them for those at my leisure.
Let me see your bank statement?
By all means.
Don't touch.
Turn back a page.
Ah. Your balance has dropped by over £1000 during the year.
Suppose the police ask you about that.
I go dog racing twice a week.
They'll check your bookmaker.
Like you, I always bet on the tout.
Satisfied?
When would this take place?
Tomorrow night.
Tomorrow? Not a chance.
I've gotta think this over.
It has to be tomorrow.
I've arranged things that way.
Where?
Approximately where you're standing now.
How?
Tomorrow evening, Halliday, the American boyfriend, and I... will go out to a stag party.
She'll stay here.
She'll go to bed early and listen to
Saturday Night Theatre on the radio.
She always does when I'm out.
At exactly three minutes to 11... you'll enter the house through the street door.
You'll find the key to this door... under the stair carpet here.
- The fifth step.
- That's the one.
Go straight to the window... and hide behind the curtains.
At exactly 11:00...
I shall go to the telephone in the hotel to call my boss.
I shall dial the wrong number, this number.
That's all I shall do.
When the phone rings... you'll see the light go on under her bedroom door.
When she opens it, the light will stream across the room.
So don't move until she answers the phone.
There must be as little noise as possible.
After you've finished... pick up the phone and give me a soft whistle, and hang up.
Don't speak, whatever you do.
I shan't say a word.
When I hear your whistle,
I shall hang up and redial... but the correct number this time.
I shall then talk to my boss as if nothing had happened and return to the party.
Well, what happens next? Go on.
You'll see the suitcase here.
It contains some clothes of mine for the cleaners.
Open it and tip the clothes out onto the floor.
Fill it with a cigarette box and some of these cups.
Close the lid, but don't snap the locks.
Then leave the suitcase there just as it is now.
- Ah, as if I'd left in a hurry.
- That's the idea.
Now the window.
If it's locked, unlock it and leave it open.
Then go out exactly the same way you came in.
- By this door?
- Yes.
And here's the most important thing:
As you go out, return the key to the place where you found it.
- Under the stair carpet?
- Yes.
Yes, but what exactly is supposed to have happened?
They'll assume you came in by the window.
You thought the apartment was empty... so you took the suitcase and went to work.
She heard something.
She switched on her light.
You saw the light under the door and hid behind the curtains.
When she came in here, you attacked her before she could scream.
When you realized you'd actually killed her... you panicked, bolted through the garden...
- and left the loot behind you.
- Just a minute.
I'm supposed to have come in through these windows.
- Suppose they'd been locked.
- It wouldn't matter.
You see, she often walks around the garden before she goes to bed... and she usually forgets to lock up when she gets back.
That's what I shall tell the police.
Yes, but she may say that....
But she isn't going to say anything, is she?
All right. I leave the apartment.
I put the key back under the stair carpet and go out by the street door.
Suppose the street door's locked.
How do I get in in the first place?
The street door is never locked.
- What time will you get back?
- About 12.
I'll bring Halliday back for a nightcap so we'll find her together.
And we shall have been together since we left her... and there's my alibi.
- You've forgotten something.
- What?
When you get back with what's-his-name, Halliday...
- how will you get into the apartment?
- I shall let myself in.
But your key will be under the stair carpet.
He'll see you getting it out.
It'll give the show away.
No. It won't be my key under the carpet, it'll be hers.
I shall take it from her handbag and hide it out there... just before I leave the flat.
She's not going out, so she won't miss it.
When I come back with Halliday,
I'll use my own key to let us in.
Then while he's out searching the garden or something...
I'll take the key from under the carpet and return it to her handbag... before the police arrive.
How many keys are there to this door?
Just hers and mine.
Maida Vale Z499.
- Tony, it's me.
- Oh, hello, darling. How's it going?
Wonderfully. It's really a splendid play.
- We're enjoying every minute.
- Oh, I'm sorry. I mean, I'm glad.
You will join us, won't you?
Well, I don't think so.
I hardly seem to have started.
Oh, darling, just a moment,
I think someone's at the door.
You can be seen from the bedroom window.
Sorry, darling. False alarm.
Look, why don't you take Mark to Gerry's?
- How do we get in?
- Well, just mention my name.
I don't know about the band, but the food's good.
By the way, Maureen called up just after you left... and wants us for dinner on Wednesday.
But you've got something written in your diary for Wednesday... and I can't read your writing.
Looks like Al Bentall.
Who's he, another one of your boyfriends?
Albert Hall, you idiot.
Oh, the Albert Hall, of course.
I'm so glad we don't have to go to Maureen's.
She's such a filthy cook.
Oh, there's the bell. I must fly.
All right, dear. Enjoy yourself.
Tony, don't make that martini too watery.
Oh, now, where's the picture of the maharaja?
Darling, when are you gonna finish pasting in those clippings?
Oh, I shall find time one of these days.
Oh, here it is.
This is the maharaja. Isn't he dreamy?
He had four Rolls-Royces and enough jewels to sink a battleship... but all he wanted was to play at Wimbledon.
The poor darling. He was so shortsighted, he could barely see the end of the racket... let alone the ball.
You know, you should, um....
Thanks, Tony.
- You should write a book about all this.
- Why don't you two collaborate?
A detective novel with a tennis...
- background.
- What about it, Mark?
Would you provide me with the perfect murder?
Nothing I'd like better.
How do you write a detective story?
Well, you forget detection and concentrate on crime. 
Crime's the thing.
Then you imagine you're going to steal something or murder somebody.
Oh, is that how you do it? Interesting.
Yes, I usually put myself in the criminal's shoes and ask myself, um:
"What do I do next?"
Do you really believe in the perfect murder?
Mm. Yes, absolutely. On paper, that is.
And I think I could plan one better than most people...
- but I doubt if I could carry it out.
- Oh? Why not?
Well, in stories, things turn out the way the author wants.
And in real life, they don't always.
- Hm.
- No, I'm afraid my murders... would be like my bridge.
I'd make a stupid mistake and never realize till I found everybody was looking at me.
- We better drink up, Mark.
- Yes.
- What are you doing tomorrow?
- Mm. Nothing I know of.
Why don't we all drive down to Windsor for lunch?
That's a good idea.
Come along early, but not too early.
- We may be nursing a hangover.
- How about 11?
Fine.
We'll have lunch at the King's Head.
Is that in Windsor?
- No, it's just outside.
- Oh.
Did I lend you my latchkey?
I can't seem to find it anywhere.
I don't know.
I may have them both in my handbag.
I'll just look.
No. I've only got one here.
Are you sure yours isn't in your overcoat?
No, I've looked. May I borrow yours?
- Well, that's a bit awkward.
- Why?
I may want to go out.
- Tonight?
- I thought I might... go to a movie or something.
Won't you listen to the radio?
Saturday Night Theatre?
Oh, no. It's a thriller.
I don't like thrillers when I'm alone.
- I see.
- Well, in any case...
I'll be back before you.
I can let you in.
But we won't be back until after midnight.
You may be asleep by then.
You can always put your key under the proverbial mat.
No, it's all right.
Here it is.
It was in my glove all the time.
Well, that settles that.
What movie are you going to?
Oh, The Classic, I expect.
Will you get in? Saturday night?
- Oh, I can always try.
- Oh, but, darling--
Now, don't make me stay home.
You know how I hate doing nothing.
Doing nothing? Why, there are hundreds of things you can do.
Have you written to Peggy thanking her for the weekend?
And what about those clippings?
It's an ideal opportunity.
Well, I like that.
You two go gallivanting... while I stay home and do those boring clippings.
Very well. We won't go.
What do you mean?
You don't want us to go out... so we won't.
We'll stay here with you instead.
What shall we do, play cards?
Oh, Tony, darling.
Well, I'd better call the Grendon and tell them we're not coming.
Oh, Tony, please, let's not be childish about this.
All right, I'll do your old press clippings.
You don't have to if you don't want to, you know.
But I do want to.
I think I'll try and scare up a taxi.
- Have we any paste?
- There's some in the desk...
I believe.
- You'll need some scissors.
- Oh, they're in my mending basket.
Lend me some change, dear.
I need some money for the taxi.
Hey, you leave my bag alone.
How much do you need anyway?
Well, let's see how much you've got.
- Put that down.
- You owe me 10 bob anyway.
- For what?
- I paid for that package you sent Peggy.
- That comes out of housekeeping.
- Let me give it to you.
Keep your hands off.
There now.
How much do you want?
Well, I've got 3, 5, 7 and sixpence.
Enough to get us there and back.
You'd better take something.
How much are the dinner tickets?
Already paid for, tip included.
If I run short, Mark will help out.
Taxi's here.
What are you waiting for?
Oh, nothing, dear. Nothing.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- What time will you get home?
- About 12, I should think.
I'll bring Mark back for a nightcap on his way home.
I'll be fast asleep and I don't want to be disturbed.
We shall be as quiet as mice.
- Night.
- Night.
Uh....
Margot?
Yes?
It's quite possible old man Burgess might call.
Tell him we're at the Grendon.
Might be important.
- What's the number? All right.
- It's in the book.
Goodbye, dear.
All right, Mark.
I was staying at the Torbay Hotel.
Know the Torbay Hotel in Dartmoor?
Well, it's not exactly in Dartmoor, but sort of in the district... if you know what I mean.
The point of this story is... that it concerns Dartmoor Prison.
Anyway...
I was staying at the Torbay Hotel.
I went to the bar one day....
So I turned and said,
"What are you doing here?"
He said, "I'm a commercial traveler.
I sell... agricultural machinery."
I said, "Agricultural"--
Excuse me. Any of you fellas have the right time?
- Yes, I have seven minutes past 11.
- I make it only just after 11.
Well, my watch has stopped.
I must have overwound it.
So as I was saying--
Excuse me, old boy.
I have to call my boss.
Agricultural machinery....
Hello.
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Get the police. Quickly. Police.
- Margot?
- Who's there?
Darling, it's me.
Oh, Tony. 
Tony, thank God. Come back at once.
What's the matter?
I can't explain now.
Come quickly, please.
Now, darling, pull yourself together.
What is it?
A man attacked me.
He tried to strangle me.
Did he get away?
No. He's dead. He's dead.
Tony, are you still there?
- Margot.
- Yes?
Now, listen very carefully.
Yes, I'm listening.
Don't touch anything.
I'll be with you right away.
No. No, I won't.
Don't touch anything and don't speak to anybody until I get there.
- No, I won't touch anything.
- You promise?
Yes, I promise.
Only, please, be quick.
I'm sitting at the same bar... and I see the same man standing at the end... and he came across to me and said--
No, do sit down. I have to run along.
It's Margot. She's not feeling well.
- Serious?
- Nothing serious.
- You stay and enjoy.
- I'll come.
No, it's perfectly all right.
--with which he was buying me dry martinis. Anyway....
Tony! Oh, Tony. 
It's all right, darling. It's all right.
What happened?
He put something around my throat.
It felt like a stocking.
Are you sure? Let me see.
I got up to answer the phone... and he came from behind the curtain and tried to strangle me.
I almost... passed out.
I felt the scissors in my hands.
Then he let go suddenly... and he fell on the floor.
There's hardly any blood.
When he fell, he must have--
What are you doing?
I'm trying to find my....
Oh, here they are. My aspirin.
I've got such an awful head.
What is it?
I'd better get a blanket.
Shut the window, please.
No, we mustn't touch anything till the police arrive.
He must've broken in.
I wonder what he was after.
Those cups, I expect.
When will the police get here?
Have you called them already?
No. You told me not to speak to anyone.
Hadn't you better call them now?
Yes.
- Where's Mark?
- I told him to go straight home.
Operator.
Hello, operator.
Get me the Maida Vale Police, quickly.
Did you tell him?
No, I didn't know what had happened.
I just said you weren't feeling well.
Maida Vale Police.
Oh, police, there's been a ghastly accident.
- Yes, sir?
- A man has been killed.
- Your name, sir?
- Wendice.
- Is that a double "S"?
- No, D-I-C-E.
C-E. Your address, sir?
61-A Charrington Gardens, the ground floor apartment.
Was it an accident?
I don't know.
What do you mean, sir, you don't know?
You think he might have been killed by someone?
Well, I don't know.
Well, have you any idea who might have done it?
I'll explain that when you come.
How long will it take?
- About two minutes.
- Two minutes?
And don't touch anything, will you, sir?
No, we won't touch anything. Goodbye.
I'll get dressed.
Why?
They'll want to see me.
- They're not going to see you.
- But they'll have to ask me questions.
They can wait till tomorrow.
I'll tell them all they need to know.
- Tony.
- Yes?
Why did you phone me?
What?
I'm sorry, darling,
I'll tell you about that later.
I just thought of something.
You said he used a stocking?
I think it was a stocking or a scarf.
Isn't it there?
No, but I expect they'll find it.
Now, you go on to bed.
Tea, gentlemen?
- Sergeant.
- Mm-hm?
Look, it's the other stocking.
All right, break it up.
Let's get moving on.
Hm. Almost empty.
Remind me to get some more.
It always runs out just when we need it.
Oh, look, before I forget, the sergeant wanted to know... why you didn't phone the police immediately.
- How could I? You were on the phone.
- I know, but--
You distinctly told me not to speak to anyone until you got here.
I know, darling, but I told him a slightly different story.
Why?
Well, I said you didn't phone the police because you assumed... that I would do it from the hotel.
Why did you say that?
Because it was the perfectly logical explanation, and he accepted it.
Now, if they get the idea that we delayed reporting it... they might get nosy and start asking all sorts of questions--
So you want me to say the same thing?
I think so, dear, in case it comes up again.
Oh, that'll be Mark.
Would you let him in?
Good morning, madam.
Oh. Good morning.
- Mrs. Wendice?
- Yes.
- I'm a police officer. May I come in?
- Of course.
Excuse me.
I'll just tell my husband you're here.
Oh, thank you.
Good morning.
Good morning, sir.
I'm Chief Inspector Hubbard... in charge of criminal investigation of this division.
We gave your sergeant all the necessary information.
Yes. I've seen his report, of course... but there are a few things
I'd like to get firsthand.
I gather the sergeant only saw you for a few moments, Mrs. Wendice?
Yes, I--
My wife was suffering from considerable shock.
Yes, that was a very nasty experience you had.
Do you mind if I take a look around?
Go ahead. The bedroom and bathroom are through here.
He certainly didn't get in by the bathroom.
And the kitchen has bars on the window.
We assume he must have come in through these windows here.
I, uh-- I understand you weren't here when this happened.
No, I was at a dinner party at the Grendon Hotel.
And by a curious coincidence...
I was actually phoning my wife when she was attacked.
So I gather. Can you tell me exactly what time it was, sir?
No, I'm afraid I can't.
I do remember my watch had stopped.
Did you notice, Mrs. Wendice?
No, I didn't.
Won't you sit down, inspector?
Thank you.
Have you any idea who he was?
Hmm? Oh, yes. At least, we've discovered where he lived.
There still seems to be some confusion as to his real name.
- Oh?
- He appeared to have several.
- Had you ever seen him before?
- Why, no, of course not.
Oh.
- Is this him?
- Yes.
- You don't recognize him?
- No, I never saw him.
But didn't you even catch a glimpse of his face?
No. You see, he attacked me from behind... and it was dark.
I hardly saw him at all.
But before I showed you these photographs, you said you'd never seen him... before.
How could you know that if you never saw his face last night?
I don't quite understand.
Inspector, my wife simply means that as far as she knew... she never saw him before.
- Was that what you meant?
- Yes.
Yeah. Now, how about you, sir?
Had you ever seen him before?
No.
No.
- At least....
- Yes?
It's very like someone
I was at college with.
But the mustache makes quite a difference.
Oh? What was his name?
Oh, I don't know.
It must be 20 years since I left.
- Was it, uh, Lesgate?
- No.
- Wilson?
- No.
Swann?
N-- Swann?
Wait a minute. Swann.
Yes, that's it.
Here's an old photo taken at a reunion.
We were at the same college together.
There he is there.
- Why, it's unbelievable.
- Did you know him well?
No. He was senior to me.
- Have you met him since then?
- No.
At least....
Come to think of it, I did see him quite recently, but not to speak to.
- Oh? When was that?
- Six months ago at a railway station.
Victoria, I think.
I remember noticing how little he'd changed.
- Had he a mustache then, sir?
- No.
Hm. Uh, Mrs. Wendice, would you show me exactly what happened last night?
- Tony, do I have to?
- I'm afraid so, darling.
I was in bed when the phone rang, and I got up and I came in here.
- Did you switch this light on?
- No.
Just show me exactly where you were standing.
I stood here and I picked up the phone.
Just one moment.
Are you sure you had your back to the window like that?
Yes.
- But why?
- Why not?
I mean, why go around the desk?
I should have picked it up from this side.
But I always answer the phone from here.
But why?
In case I have to write anything down.
I can hold the phone in my left hand.
I see. I'm sorry. Go on.
When I picked up the phone... he must have come from behind those curtains and attacked me.
- He got something around my neck.
- What do you mean by "something"?
I think it was a stocking.
I see. And what happened then?
Well, then he pushed me across the desk.
I distinctly remember feeling for the scissors.
Where were those scissors usually kept?
In that mending basket.
I'd forgotten to put them away.
Now, what makes you think he came from behind those curtains?
Where else could he have been?
- The curtains were drawn?
- Yes.
Did you draw them yourself?
No, inspector, I drew them just before I went out.
- Did you lock the window at the same time?
- Yes.
Are you quite sure of that, sir?
Oh, perfectly sure. I always lock up when I draw the curtains.
- Then how do you suppose he got in?
- We assume that he broke in.
Well, there's no sign of a break-in.
Our report shows the lock's quite undamaged.
Mrs. Wendice... why didn't you call the police... immediately this happened?
I was trying to get through to the police... when I discovered my husband was on the line.
I naturally thought he would call the police from the hotel... before he came here.
Uh, didn't it occur to you to call a doctor?
- No.
- Why ever not?
- He was dead.
- How did you know that?
I.... It was obvious.
- Did you feel his pulse?
- No, of course I didn't.
Anyone would have realized he was dead.
Just one look at those staring eyes--
Oh, so you did see his face, after all.
I saw his eyes!
I can't remember his face!
Inspector, my wife obviously had never seen this man before.
If he didn't come in by those windows, how did he get in?
As a matter of fact, we're quite certain that he came in by this door.
But it was locked.
Margot, did you open that door at all after we'd gone?
No.
- How many keys are there to this door?
- Only two.
Mine was in my handbag, and you had yours with you.
Yes, that's right.
- Has the caretaker got a key?
- No.
Do you employ a charwoman?
Yes, but she hasn't got one either.
I'm always here when she comes.
What makes you think he came in this way?
His shoes.
His shoes?
The ground was soaking wet last night.
And if he'd come in by the garden, he'd have left mud all over the carpet.
As it is, he didn't leave any marks at all... because he wiped his shoes on the front doormat.
How can you tell?
It's a fairly new mat and some of its fibers came off on his shoes.
Oh, but surely--
And there was a small tar stain on the mat, and some of the fibers show that as well.
No, there's no question about it.
Wait a minute. I think I've got it.
You remember when your bag was stolen?
Yes.
Wasn't the key inside?
Yes, but it was still there when I got it back.
Now, just a moment.
I'd like to hear about this.
What sort of bag?
A handbag, inspector.
My wife lost it at Victoria Station.
But I got it back from the lost and found about two weeks later.
Was anything missing?
All the money was gone.
- Anything else?
- No.
- I mean, no papers or letters?
- No.
Are you quite sure about that?
Yes.
Your latchkey was in your handbag when you lost it?
Yes, but it was still there when it was returned.
Whoever stole the money could have copied the key.
Where was the bag found eventually?
At Victoria Station.
Wasn't that where you said you saw this man, sir?
When did you lose the bag?
Wasn't it that weekend we went to visit Peggy?
Yes, it was. I remember now.
He was sitting in the restaurant.
That where you left your bag?
Yes, and didn't I say something about
"There's someone I was at college with"?
I don't remember.
That's how he got in.
He had a duplicate made...
- and returned the original to the bag.
- Before you go any further... how did he get in through the street door?
Well, the street door is never locked.
I see.
He could have had your key copied... and he could have used it to open the door... but of course he didn't.
Why not?
Because if he had... the key would still have been on him when he died.
No key was found when we went through his pockets.
We seem to be back just where we started, don't we?
Well, not quite.
Well, then how did he get in?
We'd better get all this down on paper.
I'd like you both to make an official statement... before the inquest.
My office is only a few moments from here.
Perhaps you could come now.
- Tony.
- Mark. Oh, this is Inspector Hubbard.
Inspector, this is Mark Halliday.
He was with me last night.
How do you do, inspector?
As you were with Mr. Wendice last night, you may be able to help us here.
Now, did you notice what time it was he went to the phone?
Yes, matter of fact, it was just three minutes after 11.
How did you come to notice that?
Well, Mr. Wendice's watch had stopped and some of us compared times.
Thank you. So you see, it was when Mrs. Wendice came in here... to answer his call that she was attacked.
Did you phone Margot before or after you phoned your boss?
Tony, I know what I wanted to ask you.
Why did you... telephone me last night?
Now, just one moment, before I lose the thread of this.
Now, at three minutes past 11, you left your party to phone your boss.
Yes, I used the pay phone in the lobby.
How long were you on the telephone to your boss before you called your wife?
In fact, I never did speak to him.
I couldn't remember his number... so I rang my wife to ask her to look it up in the address book.
You mean you hauled me out of bed just to get his number?
I had to, darling.
My boss is flying to Brussels this morning.
I wanted to remind him of something.
It was rather important.
Wasn't there a telephone directory in the hotel?
Yes, but his country number wouldn't be in that directory.
Mm. And did you phone him?
Oh, no. Naturally when I heard what had happened here, I forgot all about it.
Mm. Yes.
Mr. Halliday, Mr. and Mrs. Wendice are coming to my office... to make their statements.
Would you give me your address, sir?
I may want to get in touch with you.
- Why, certainly.
- I'll get my coat.
I'm staying at Carfax Hotel.
Just write it down there, will you?
Your telephone number as well.
All right.
Ever been over here before, sir?
- Uh, yes. Yes, about a year ago.
- Mm.
- There you are, sir.
- Thank you.
Uh, Mr. Wendice.
There's quite a crowd in front of the house.
I was going to suggest that we left by the garden.
- Isn't there's a gate at the far end?
- Yes.
I'm afraid the gate may be locked.
Would you mind taking a look, sir?
Certainly.
How much does he know about you and Mrs. Wendice?
I beg your pardon?
You wrote a letter to Mrs. Wendice from New York.
It was found in the dead man's inside pocket.
I didn't mention it because
I wasn't sure how much Mr. Wendice knew.
Have you any idea how it got there?
No.
- Where's Tony?
- He's just gone into the garden.
Mrs. Wendice, when you lost your handbag... did you lose a letter as well?
No.
Margot, it was found in the dead man's pocket.
You did lose it, didn't you?
Yes, I did.
I asked you that before, didn't I?
Yes, but you see, my husband didn't know about it.
This man was blackmailing you, wasn't he?
It's no good.
- Tony will have to know.
- No.
It's the only thing we can do. Inspector... after Mrs. Wendice lost my letter, she received these two notes.
Last October.
How many times have you seen this man?
I've never seen him.
- I'd like you to come along with us.
- Yes, of course.
Mrs. Wendice, when you come to make your statement... there may be other police officers present.
I shall warn you first that anything you say... will be taken down and may be used in evidence.
Now, never mind what you've told me so far.
We'll forget all about that.
But from now on, tell us exactly what you know about this man... and exactly what happened last night.
If you try and conceal... anything at all... it may put you in a very serious position.
I wish you'd explain what you mean by all this.
I will. Now, you admit that you killed this man.
Well, you say you did it in self-defense.
Unfortunately, there were no witnesses... so we've only your word for that.
But I heard it all, inspector, over the telephone.
What exactly did you hear, Mr. Wendice?
Well, I heard a series of faint cries.
Well, did you hear anything to indicate that a struggle was going on?
What I did hear, inspector, is perfectly consistent with what my wife told me.
So all you really know of the matter is what your wife told you, isn't it?
Now, you suggest that this man came to burgle your flat... but there's no evidence of that.
There is evidence, however, that he was blackmailing you.
Blackmail?
Yes, I'm afraid that's true.
And you suggest he came in by the window.
And we know that he came in by that door.
But he can't have come in that way.
That door was locked.
And there are only two keys.
My husband had his with him and mine was in my handbag. Here.
You could have let him in.
Are you suggesting she let him in herself?
That appears to be the only way he could've entered.
Don't you even believe I was attacked?
How do you think
I got these bruises on my throat?
You could have caused those bruises yourself.
A silk stocking was found outside the window.
It had two knots tied in it.
Does that mean anything to you?
I suppose it must have been the stocking he used.
We found the twin stocking hidden underneath this blotting pad.
Can you explain why your attacker should do that?
No.
Those stockings were yours, weren't they?
No.
We know they were.
One of the heels had been darned with some silk that didn't quite match.
We found a reel of that silk in your mending basket.
Tony, there was a pair of stockings here.
I've heard of the police deliberately planting clues to ensure a conviction.
His men were here for hours last night.
They could've taken those stockings and done anything with them.
Of course they did.
Probably wiped his shoes on the doormat as well.
Hello?
Oh, hello, Roger, thank heaven you're in.
Tony Wendice here.
Uh, listen, we had a burglary last night and Margot was attacked.
Margot? Was she hurt?
No, she's all right, but the man was killed, and the police are here.
And don't laugh... they're suggesting that Margot killed him intentionally.
I wouldn't say that if I were you, sir.
Well, that's a good one. 
Yes, it is funny, isn't it?
Now, Roger, could you come around at once,
Maida Vale Police Station?
- I'll be there right away.
- Oh, thanks, old boy. Goodbye.
It's all right, darling.
Roger's gonna meet us at the police station.
Mr. Wendice, I should advise you--
Our lawyer will give us any advice we need, thank you.
Margot.
- Here's your handbag.
- Thank you.
- You are coming?
- Oh, but of course, inspector.
Yes. Yes, well, I just--
I mean, I just wondered.
I charge you that on the 26th of September...
you did willfully murder
Charles Alexander Swann.
Do you wish to say anything in answer to this charge?
And did you, at any time in your life, meet this man, Swann?
You received a letter from Mr. Halliday.
This letter was found in the dead man's pocket.
Now you say you did not know him?
Do you find the prisoner,
Margot Mary Wendice...
guilty or not guilty?
Guilty.
The sentence of this court...
is that you be taken to the place from whence you came...
from thence to a place of lawful execution.
- Oh, hello, Mark.
- Tony.
I--
Have you, uh, gotten any news from the Home Secretary?
Then it's tomorrow?
Tony, I take it you'd do anything to save her life.
- We've done everything.
- No, Tony, we haven't done everything.
I've been trying to figure out something for weeks in case it came to this.
- Now I really believe it's her only chance.
- Let's have it.
Margot was convicted because nobody believed her story.
The prosecution made out she was telling one lie after another... and the jury believed him.
But what did his case really amount to?
Just three things:
My letter, her stocking... and the fact that because no key was found on Swann...
- she must've let him in herself.
- Don't try and tell me--
Wait a minute, Tony. Now, hear me out.
This is where you come in.
You go to the police and tell them... some story... anything that will convince them
Margot wasn't lying after all.
The police aren't likely to believe anything I might tell them.
Tony, I've been writing this stuff for years.
I've figured out something for you to tell them.
Now, let's take those points one by one.
Margot says she never let Swann in through this door.
Okay.
He must have opened it somehow.
Suppose you tell the police that you left your key out here somewhere.
Then Swann could have let himself in.
- How'd he know it was there?
- You told him.
But I haven't met Swann in 20 years.
Tony, Swann is dead.
Now, we've gotta make the most of that.
You can tell any story about him now.
You can even say that you two met somewhere... and you planned this whole thing together.
Planned what?
Are you suggesting I arranged for Swann to come here... to blackmail her?
No.
To kill her.
- Kill Margot?
- That's it.
Why?
Because she said so.
"He came from behind the curtain... and he tried to strangle me."
Okay, that's what he did.
All you gotta do is support everything she said.
Don't you see? That's my whole idea.
What about your letter?
A man doesn't kill the person he's blackmailing.
Doesn't make sense.
Yes, I know. That worried me for a while too, but I've got that licked.
You tell them... that you stole her handbag yourself.
Why should I do that?
Because you wanted to read my letter.
When you had read it, you got mad and decided to teach her a lesson.
So you wrote those blackmail notes.
Nobody can prove you didn't.
You can also say you never saw Swann at Victoria Station.
You just invented that to try to connect him with my letter.
Don't you see how it all hangs together?
But your letter was found in his pocket.
- Well, you put it there.
- When?
Sometime before the police arrived.
And you could have also... planted the stockings... at the same time.
But, Mark, why should I want anyone to kill Margot?
I know, Tony.
It's tough for us to see because we both love her... but we need a reason now.
We need it badly.
Let's take one of the old stock motives.
Had Margot made a will?
- Yes, I believe she had.
- Who was the beneficiary?
Why, I am, I suppose.
There's your reason, Tony.
Thousands of husbands and wives leave money to each other... without murdering each other.
The police wouldn't believe it.
They'd take it for what it is:
A man trying desperately to save his wife.
Well, I certainly think it's worth that try.
Let's face it. They can't hang you for a murder that never came off.
You'd get a few years in prison.
Thanks very much.
It's a small price to pay.
You'd be saving her life.
That's fine coming from you, Mark.
Her life wouldn't be in danger at all if it hadn't been for you.
It's because of her association with you that she lost the sympathy of the jury.
Don't get me wrong, Mark.
If there was the slightest chance of this coming off, I'd do it... but it's got to be convincing.
For instance, how could I possibly have persuaded Swann to do a thing like this?
Well, you offered him money...
- or something.
- Money? I don't have any.
Yes, you'd have had Margot's.
It'd be months before
I get my hands on that... and people don't commit murder on credit.
No, I'm....
I'm afraid you'll have to think of something better than that.
I know you're trying to help... but can you imagine anyone believing a story like that?
Yes, I can, if you make them believe it.
I wouldn't know what to say.
You'd have to come with me.
Tony, that'd really be a mistake.
They know the kind of stuff I write.
We wouldn't stand a chance there--
Oh, hello, inspector.
Is it about my wife?
- No, sir, I'm afraid not.
- Then what is it?
Well, I'm making inquiries in connection with a robbery... that took place about three weeks ago, sir.
Well, can't it wait a few days?
Of course, sir.
I'm very conscious of your position.
If I may, I'd like to say how deeply sorry I am--
Yes, inspector, yes, all right.
Now, how can I help you?
The cashier of a factory in Ledbury Street... was attacked in his office... and two men made off with several hundred pounds... mostly in pound notes.
What is all this to do with me?
Well, in cases like this, all police divisions are asked to keep a lookout... for anyone spending large sums of money.
I see.
And I was wondering if you'd sold anything recently for cash.
Why?
Well, my sergeant happened to be making inquiries at Wales' Garage the other day... and it appears that you settled an account there recently... for just over £60.
Yes, I happened to have quite a bit on me at the time... so I settled for cash.
I see.
Had you just drawn this money from your bank?
Have you been to my bank, inspector?
Yes. Yeah, as a matter of fact, I have, yeah.
Yeah, but they wouldn't help me.
Oh, bank statements are always jealously guarded.
Yes, but I'm rather surprised you didn't come to me first.
It was only a routine matter after all.
I didn't want to disturb you.
Where did you get it, sir?
Is that any of your business?
Well, if it was stolen money, yes, sir, it is my business.
- Do you mind if I smoke?
- Go ahead.
Do you really think
I've been receiving stolen money?
Well, until you tell me where you got it...
I shan't know what to think, shall I?
You see... if you got this money from someone you didn't know...
I mean, that might be the very person we're looking for.
Hello.
- Is this yours, sir?
- What is it?
Somebody's latchkey.
It was lying on the floor just here.
No. Mine's here.
No. No, it's not yours.
It may be mine then.
Yes. Yes, it is mine. 
Yes, it must have dropped out of the pocket.
There's a small hole there.
That's the trouble with these latchkeys, they're all alike.
I'm sorry, you were saying?
- I don't think I was, was I?
- Oh, yes, about that money.
I'd be grateful if you'd tell me where you got it.
After all, £100 is quite a lot to carry around.
- You said 60 a moment ago.
- Did I? Oh, yes.
Yes, my sergeant decided to dig a little deeper before he put in his report.
He said that you also paid a bill at your tailor's... and another for wines and spirits.
I'm sorry he went to all that trouble.
Had he come to me,
I could've explained at once.
I simply won rather a large sum at dog racing.
Over £100?
Yes, over £100.
It has been done before, you know.
Yes, well, why didn't you tell me this straightaway then?
Well, I was rather ashamed of being caught going to dog racing... when my wife is under sentence of death.
Yes, I know how it is.
It helps to take your mind off things.
Well, that answers everything, doesn't it?
I'm sorry to have to bother you at this time.
Not at all, inspector.
Not at all.
Uh, there's just one other thing, sir.
Have you a small, blue attaché case?
- Don't say you found it already.
- Why, have you lost it?
Yes. I was going to report it this afternoon. I think...
- I left it in a taxi.
- I see.
Well, we-- We must try and get it back, mustn't we?
Where did you pick the taxi up, sir?
Uh, Hyde Park Corner about half an hour ago.
Anything valuable?
- No, a few books and, uh--
- Any money?
Two or £3 in an envelope, I believe.
Not 2- or 300?
No, I'm afraid not.
Just as well.
Inspector, how did you find out about the attaché case?
The wine shop mentioned you had it when you paid your bill.
So my sergeant checked back on your garage and your tailor.
They both remembered you having it when you paid them.
- Yes, I use it instead of a briefcase.
- Mm. Well... these taxi men are pretty good at turning things in.
I hope you'll find it all right, sir.
Inspector, before you go...
I think Mr. Wendice has something to tell you.
Has he?
Then I'd like to show you something in here, sir.
No wonder you couldn't bear to sleep in her bedroom.
There must be over £500 here.
Where did you get it?
Well, I can tell you why he got it.
This money was to have been paid to a man named Swann... after he murdered Mrs. Wendice.
But as you know, there was an accident... so it wasn't necessary to pay Swann after all.
Obviously, he couldn't produce all this without questions being asked... so he lived on it.
He's been living on it since the 27th of March.
Well, Mr. Wendice?
Before you came, inspector, he was trying to persuade me... to go to the police with the most fantastic story you ever heard.
Apparently, I bribed Swann to murder my wife so that....
Correct me if I go wrong, Mark.
So that I could inherit all her money.
And that isn't all.
You remember Mr. Halliday's letter?
Well, apparently, Swann didn't steal it, I did... and I wrote those two blackmail notes... and I kept Mr. Halliday's letter and planted it on the body.
- And the stocking--
- Oh, yes, the stocking.
Perhaps I'd better tell this, Mark.
Might sound more like a confession.
I substituted.... Is that the right word?
Yes. I substituted my wife's other stocking for the one that.... Uh--
You do follow me, don't you?
What else, Mark?
He told Swann... he'd hide his key somewhere out here... probably up on this ledge.
Swann let himself in.
He hid behind the curtains.
Then Wendice phoned from the hotel.
- That brought her--
- Just one moment.
If Swann had used Mr. Wendice's key... it would still have been on him when he died.
Besides, how did Mr. Wendice get in when he returned from the hotel?
Well, she could have let him in.
He could've taken his key from Swann's pocket before the police got here.
But he let himself in with his own key.
That came out in the trial.
Don't you remember?
Come on, Mark. Your move.
Uh....
Swann could have taken the key down from here, unlocked the door... and then replaced the key on the ledge before he came in.
All right. This is very interesting... but it isn't getting me any nearer what I came to find out.
But this is a question of life and death.
What else matters?
What matters to me is where Mr. Wendice got this money.
That's all I want to know.
Just a moment, please, sir.
Inspector, wait a minute. Look at this.
The last check he wrote was on the 26th of March... the day before this all happened.
He's been living off it ever since.
- There's his bank--
- Mr. Halliday.
Sorry.
He hasn't drawn any large sums from his bank.
Nothing over £53.
But look, inspector, practically every week.
Thirty-five pounds, 40...
He could've saved it up.
Of course I could've been planning all this for years.
Then where did you get it?
Do you really want to know?
I warn you, you won't like it, Mark.
Come on.
All right, you asked for it.
When she called me back from the party that night...
I found her kneeling beside Swann's body, going through his pockets.
She kept saying he had something of hers, but she couldn't find it.
She was almost hysterical.
That's why I wouldn't let the police question her.
In the state she was in, she would have told every lie under the sun.
The next morning she showed me the money just as it is now, all in £1 notes.
And she said, "If anything happens to me, don't let them find this."
Well, after she was arrested,
I took the money in that case... to Charing Cross Station and left it in the checkroom.
Whenever I needed money, I took it out and left it in some other checkroom.
I knew if you had found it, she wouldn't stand a chance.
You see, she was just about to give it to him when she killed him instead.
You don't expect anyone to believe this, do you?
I have really no idea.
What about it, inspector?
Hm?
Well, I must say I suspected something like that.
You're not even gonna check on this?
She's being hanged tomorrow.
Look, all this has been out of my hands for months.
There's been a trial and an appeal--
Oh, of course it wouldn't mean much to you.
You'd have to admit you arrested the wrong person.
I think you'd better go.
You bet I'll go.
But you've made one mistake.
What'll happen when Margot hears about this?
- She'll deny it, of course.
- And perhaps she'll change her will.
You'll have done it all for nothing, Tony.
If I'd told that story of his, would anyone have believed me?
No, not a chance.
Before nearly every execution, someone comes forward like this.
This must have been very distressing for you, coming as it did.
You suppose they'd let him see her?
I don't want her upset just now.
Have a word with your lawyer.
He might be able to prevent it.
I should get all that money into the bank before somebody pinches it.
Thank you. I think I will.
I hope Mr. Halliday's not waiting outside to see me.
Would you mind just taking a look, sir, to make sure he's gone?
All clear.
Good. Oh, by the way, sir,
I was asked to tell you.
There are a few things belonging to Mrs. Wendice at the police station.
What sort of things?
Oh, just some books and a handbag,
I believe.
They'd like you to come and collect them sometime.
- You mean after tomorrow?
- Yes, or today, if you like.
Just ask the desk sergeant.
He knows all about it.
- Yes.
- Well, goodbye, Mr. Wendice.
I don't suppose we shall meet again.
Goodbye, inspector, and thank you very much.
Maida Vale Police.
Chief inspector here.
Give me Sergeant O'Brien, quick.
O'Brien here.
Hubbard. Look, O'Brien,
I've got back in again.
Start the ball rolling.
Right away, sir.
Inspector Hubbard, it's me,
Mark Halliday.
Now, what are you up to?
What's the idea?
- What are you doing here?
- Never mind that.
- I wondered why--
- Get out of here, quick.
- Listen--
- Shut up.
You want to save Mrs. Wendice?
Keep quiet. Let me handle this.
How are you possibly gonna--?
Look, what is all this?
They talk about flat-footed policemen.
May the saints protect us from the gifted amateur.
You'd better prepare yourself for a surprise, Mr. Halliday.
Margot.
Hello, Mark.
Where's Tony?
He-- He's gone out.
When will he be back?
We're not sure.
Was that you who rang just now?
Yes. Why didn't you let me in?
You've got a key.
Why didn't you use it?
- I did, but it didn't fit the lock.
- No. And you know why, don't you?
No, I don't.
Has the lock been changed?
May I have your bag a moment?
Whose key is this?
I thought it was mine.
I don't know.
What's going on here?
Your husband's explained this, you know.
You can tell us all about it now.
What is it? I don't understand.
No, I don't believe you do.
- Pearson?
- Yes, sir.
Take this handbag back to the police station... and get that car out of the way.
- Yes, sir.
- Wait a minute, you clod.
You can't walk down the street like that.
You'll be arrested.
Well, here. Put it in this.
Margot, how did you get here?
I don't know.
About an hour ago, the warden came to see me... and just said I was to be taken home.
And then two detectives brought me here.
They said I could go, but I couldn't get that door open.
Where's Tony?
He was supposed to visit me this morning... and they said he couldn't come.
Has anything happened to him?
No. Nothing.
Inspector, I don't wanna interfere... but do you think you could tell us what you're up to?
Mrs. Wendice, what I'm about to tell you may come as a shock.
Yes?
We strongly suspect that your husband had planned to murder you.
Tony arranged for Swann to come here that night and kill you.
How long have you known this?
Did you suspect it yourself?
No, never. And yet....
What's the matter with me, Mark?
I don't seem able to feel anything.
Shouldn't I break down or something?
It's delayed action, that's all.
In a couple of days, you're gonna have the most wonderful breakdown.
When did you find out, sir?
Well, the first clue came quite by accident.
We discovered that your husband... had been spending a large number of pound notes all over the place.
It ran into over £300.
And it appeared to have started at about the time you were arrested.
Now, I had to find out where he got that money and how.
And then I remembered... that after you were arrested, we searched this flat.
And I saw a copy of his bank statement in that desk.
So yesterday afternoon, I went to the prison and asked to see your handbag.
While I was doing this,
I managed to lift your latchkey. 
Highly irregular, of course, but my blood was up.
And then this morning when your husband was out...
I came back here to look at his statement.
I never saw it, because I never got through that door.
You see, the key that I'd taken from your handbag... didn't fit the lock.
Williams?
Wendice. 
Oh, that was a near one.
Maida Vale Police. O'Brien speaking.
Hubbard. Look, O'Brien, he's found out about his raincoat.
He just came back and couldn't get in.
I think he's on his way to the station now.
- Has Pearson arrived with the handbag?
- Yes, sir.
Good. Now, listen.
Give Wendice those books and the handbag... and make sure he sees the key.
Better make him check the contents and sign for them.
If he wants his own key and raincoat, tell him I've gone to Glasgow.
Right, sir.
- Any questions?
- No.
- Right. Call me back when he leaves.
- Right, sir.
Well, Mr. Halliday, have you got it?
I don't think so.
Where's Mrs. Wendice's key?
It took me just half an hour to find it.
But if it was there, why didn't Wendice use it just now?
Didn't use it because he doesn't realize it's there.
He still thinks it's in his wife's handbag.
You see, you were very nearly right.
He told Swann that he would leave your latchkey... under the stair carpet, Mrs. Wendice... and told him to return it to the same place when he left.
But as Swann was killed, we naturally assumed... that your key would still be in one of Swann's pockets. 
That was his little mistake... because Swann had done exactly as you suggested, Mr. Halliday.
He unlocked the door... then returned the key before he came in.
And it's been out there ever since.
And the key Wendice took out of Swann's pocket... and returned to her handbag was--
Swann's own latchkey.
Mind you, even I didn't guess that at once.
Extraordinary.
You know, it had always puzzled me that no key was found on Swann's body.
After all, most men carry a latchkey about with them.
And then I had a brainwave.
I took the key that was in your handbag... to his girlfriend's, Mrs. Van Dorn's, and unlocked the door of her flat... and then I borrowed her telephone and called Scotland Yard.
Why did you bring me here?
Because you were the only other person... who could possibly have left that key outside.
I had to find out if you knew it was there.
Suppose I had known?
You didn't.
- Mark.
- Yes, darling?
I think I'm going to have that breakdown.
- Inspector Hubbard?
- O'Brien?
- Yes. He's just left the station.
- Right.
Try and hang on just a little longer.
Williams, he's just left the station.
Give me a thump if he comes this way.
- Can I have a handkerchief?
- What happens now?
Sooner or later, he'll come back here.
As I've pinched his latchkey, he'll try the one in the handbag.
When that doesn't fit, he'll realize his mistake... put two and two together, and look under the stair carpet.
But if he doesn't do that, all this is pure guesswork. We can't prove a thing.
That's perfectly true, but once he opens that door...
- we shall know everything.
- What will you do then?
I'm to phone the Home Secretary personally.
He's standing by for a call now.
- And Mrs. Wendice?
- Will have nothing else to fear.
All right, Margot?
Yes, I'm all right.
Quiet now, you two.
What's he doing? 
He's wondering why that key doesn't fit.
He's going around to the back entrance.
He's stopped again.
He's looking at the handbag now.
He's trying to remember when he put the key back in there.
Now he's given up.
I'm afraid we've had it this time.
He's going way down the street.
Hold it.
He's stopped again. He's turning round.
He's staring at the key.
Of course. That's Swann's key, isn't it?
Now he's got it.
He's coming back fast.
He's remembered.
As you said, Mark, it, uh, might work out on paper but, uh--
Congratulations, Inspector.
Oh, by the way....
Oh, how about you, Margot?
Yes, I could do with something.
- Mark?
- So could I.
I suppose you're still on duty, inspector.

Yes, I want to be human again. But, who are you?
All right, if you want to know..Do you recognize me?
Satan..
Indeed, I am Satan and I can give you anything you want, as long you fulfill all my conditions.
All right.
Well done, well done.Now take off your clothes.
Good. Now wear this ring. You will be more powerful from any human.
Don’t forget, 21 virgins within a week. After that, you will be a delightful man.
Wear the ring.
Now, you will be known as the Oily Man
We are back..
Welcome home..
Catch a lot of fish?
Not so much. It was stormy weather last night.
The sun is so high up..
A calf die stranded..
I looked for you so long my love..
Only now I get..

Who screamed just now?
I dont know, it might be the singer.

Weird,Fatimah’s face is marked with oil too.
Where is Saadiah?
Saadiah!
Saadiah..
Yes, thank you.

Isn’t that right Usman?
Thank you.
Many thanks you to come joining us tonight.
Same goes to you.
Chieftain,our village is cursed. 
3 women from our village was raped and their faces was marked with oil.
Marked with oil?
Oily Man perhaps?
Impposible,there no Oily Man inside our village.
We lost him. He is gone!
Curse has fallen upon our village. 
The women became victim.
Oily Man has gone on a rampage.
 I ask of you on your own freewill.
Gather young courageous warrior and guard our village. 
To cleanse Tualang Tree village from shame.
Chase him! 
I saw the oily man fell here.
Yes,he is gone nowhere to be found.
That is a test. Later you will be fine.
How many girls?
Eight.

Two days.
Excellent! Don’t waste time, go and find more. Move!
Oh God.. Why..
Why I am ill-fated dear God..
Peace be upon you
And peace be upon you..

I'm worried, he is getting weaker.
Take this incantation water. Give him to drink this.
Thank you,please come in.
Usman, why bad luck has fall upon our village?
Chieftain, don’t think too much.God willing, our village will be safe.
It is true chieftain.
Chieftain is at home?
Speak slowly, don't let him hear you.What is it Ali?
More women become victims.
Oily man is rampaging.
Oily Man..
Oily Man..Where is he! Where is..

Bunian Elder!

Help...Help..
Stop grieving now, for the Oily Man is no longer free.
Praise to God. I am leaving you a reminder, dear villagers of Tualang Three 
If you insult other creature, you lose happiness and disaster follows..
You are leaderless.
As replacement, you are now responsible to lead this historical Tualang Three village.
The end.
Silence. Be upstanding in court.
All persons who have anything to do before my lords, the queen's justices of oyer and terminer and general jail delivery for the jurisdiction of the Central Criminal Court draw near and give your attendance.
God save the queen.
What a beautiful day. I've been hoping for a bit of sun for our homecoming.
It's worth having the fog just to appreciate the sunshine. Is there a draught?
- Shall I roll up the window?
- Roll up your mouth. You talk too much.
If I'd known how much you talked
I'd never have come out of my coma.
- This thing weighs a ton.
- Now, now.
We've been flat on our back for two months, we'd better be careful.
Lovely, lovely. It must be perfectly lovely to live and work in the Inns of Court.
How lucky you lawyers are.
I almost married a lawyer.
I was in attendance for his appendectomy and we became engaged as soon as he could sit up.
And then peritonitis set in and he went like that.
He certainly was a lucky lawyer.
Teeny-weeny steps, now. Remember we had a teeny-weeny heart attack.
Oh, shut up!
Williams, my cane.
Here he comes!
Good afternoon. Thank you very much.
Everybody back to work.
Sir Wilfrid, if you don't mind, I'd like to read you a poem to welcome you back.
Very touching. You can recite it after office hours in your own time.
Now back to work.
What's the matter with you?
Nothing. I'm just happy that you're your old self again.
Any more sentimentality around here,
I shall go back to the hospital!
They won't take him back.
He wasn't really discharged, you know, he was expelled for conduct unbecoming a cardiac patient.
Put these in water, blabbermouth!
Come on in, Carter.
Look at this room.
It's ugly, old and musty.
But I never knew
I could miss anything so much.
- Missed you too, you musty old buzzard.
- Oh, thank you, sir.
I'm not a religious man, but when they carted you off, I went out and lit a candle.
- Why, thank you, Carter.
- Actually, sir, I was lighting it for myself.
If anything happened to you, what would happen to me, after 37 years?
37 years! Has it been all that long?
Yes, sir. This is 1952, that was in October
1915. The Shepherd's Bush murder.
The chemist accused of putting cyanide in his uncle's toothpaste.
My first murder trial.
I was more frightened than the defendant.
First time I rose to make an objection, my wig fell off. Where's my wig?
Right here.
- I've guarded it with me life.
- I hope it still fits.
I lost 30lbs in that wretched hospital.
Still, I suppose my head isn't any smaller.
What's all this?
- We've put it in mothballs.
- Mothballs? Am I not to practise again?
Of course. The solicitors have been breaking down our doors.
- I've got some interesting briefs for you.
- That's better.
Divorce case, a tax appeal, and an important marine insurance claim.
- Nice smooth matters with excellent fees.
- No, Carter.
I'm sorry, but you're not to undertake any criminal cases. Your doctors have...
Doctors! They've deprived me of alcohol, tobacco, female companionship.
If only they'd let me do something worthwhile!
Sorry, sir.
Might as well get a bigger box, more mothballs, put me away too.
- 2.30, Sir Wilfrid. Time for our little nap!
- Oh, get out!
Beddy-bye. We'd better go upstairs now, get undressed and lie down.
- We? What a nauseating prospect.
- Upstairs, please.
Are you aware that, while on my sickbed,
I seriously considered strangling you with one of your own rubber tubes.
I would then have admitted the crime, retained myself for the defence.
My lord, members of the jury, I hereby enter a plea of justifiable homicide.
For four months this alleged ángel of mercy has pored, probed, punctured, pillaged and plundered my helpless body while tormenting my mind with a steady drip of baby talk.
Come along now, like a good boy. Oh, no.
Take your hands off me, or I'll strike you with my cane.
- You wouldn't, it might break your cigars.
- What cigars?
- The ones you're smuggling in your cane.
- Cane?
You could be jailed for this.
You had no search warrant.
In hospital he'd hide cigars and brandy all over the place.
We called him Wilfrid the fox.
- I'm confiscating these.
- Can't I have just one?
No. Upstairs.
A few puffs after meals? Please.
I'll do it. Some dark night when her back is turned, I'll snatch her thermometer and plunge it between her shoulder blades. So help me, I will.
Oh, no, sir. You mustn't walk up. We've installed something for you here. It's a lift.
A lift? I'm sick of this plot to make me a helpless invalid.
I think it's a splendid idea.
Let's try it, shall we?
Out of there. I'll try it.
It's my lift because it was my heart attack.
Here you are. Simply press this button for up and this one for down.
Carter, I warn you, if this contraption should collapse, if the barrister should fall off the bannister...
Remarkable.
Smoothest flight I've had in years.
- Upsy-daisy!
- Once more to get the feel of the controls.
Good afternoon.
Is it possible to see Sir Wilfrid?
I didn't make an appointment, but this is urgent.
If it's about a brief, I'm sorry, but we're full. Sir Wilfrid has all that he can handle.
I'm sure he'll want this brief.
Serious criminal matter.
Absolutely not, Mr Mayhew.
Sir Wilfrid is still convalescent.
He can't accept anything of an overstimulating nature.
Put me on a diet of bland civil suits.
Hello, Mayhew.
Hello. Distressing news about your health.
It's tragic. You'd better get a man with younger arteries.
If you could just give us a few minutes.
This is Mr Leonard Vole.
- He's in rather a ghastly mess, I'm afraid.
- How do you do, Mr Vole?
Well, according to Mr Mayhew,
I'm not doing at all well.
Sir Wilfrid! Sir Wilfrid!
- You're dawdling again!
- Oh, shut up!
Sorry, Mayhew. Try me again when you've something not too stimulating.
Like a postman bitten by a stray dog.
I wish you could help us, Wilfrid, but
I quite understand. Take care of yourself.
Mayhew! Mayhew!
Oh, no. Sir Wilfrid, please.
Don't worry, we won't take the brief, but an old friend needs help.
Surely I can give him a word of advice.
Come on, I'll give you five minutes.
No, no, I don't want you, just Mayhew.
Our nap! Sir Wilfrid! Our nap!
You go ahead. Start it without me.
This is your fault.
You should not have permitted it.
It is not my fault. I distinctly told
Sir Wilfrid no criminal cases.
Well, if it's anyone's fault,
I expect it's mine.
Seems silly to me, but Mr Mayhew thinks it's very urgent.
- He thinks I may be arrested any minute.
- Arrested for what?
Well, for murder.
Oh!
It's the case of Emily French.
You've probably seen reports in the press.
Middle-aged widow, well-off, living with a housekeeper at Hampstead.
Mr Vole had been with her earlier.
When the housekeeper returned, she found her dead, struck on the back of the head and killed.
Vole seems caught in a web of circumstantial evidence.
Perhaps if I gave you the details you'd suggest the strongest line of defence.
- I'd probably think better with a cigar.
- Of course.
No previous convictions. He's of good character with an excellent war record.
- You'd like him a lot.
- They've confiscated the matches. A light.
The defence may turn on establishing an alibi for the night of the murder.
- I haven't got any. Let me get you some.
- Lord, no! You don't know Miss Plimsoll.
This will take all our cunning.
Young man!
Come here, please.
Your solicitor and I feel you may be able to enlighten me on an important point.
- Yes. Thank you.
- Sir Wilfrid!
You're not in bed yet? Upstairs!
- Give me a match.
- Sorry, I never carry them.
- What? You said I'd like him.
- But I do have a lighter.
You're quite right, Mayhew,
I do like him. Thank you.
Can you imagine Miss Plimsoll's face if she saw me now?
Then let's make absolutely sure that she doesn't.
Splendid. All the instincts of a skilled criminal.
- Thank you, sir.
- Here.
Whether or not you murdered a middle-aged widow, you certainly saved the life of an elderly barrister.
I haven't murdered anybody. It's absurd.
Christine, that's my wife, she thought
I may be implicated and needed a lawyer.
That's why I went to see Mr Mayhew.
Now he thinks he needs a lawyer and now I have two lawyers.
It's rather silly.
I am a solicitor. Sir Wilfrid is a barrister.
Only a barrister can actually plead a case in court.
- Oh, I see.
- She shall not even find the ashes.
- Sit down.
- Thank you.
I saw in the paper that Mrs French had been found dead with her head bashed in.
It also said the police were anxious to interview me since I visited that evening.
- Naturally, I went to the police station.
- Did they caution you?
I don't quite know.
They asked if I'd like to make a statement and said they'd write it down and it might be used against me. Is that a caution?
Well, it can't be helped now.
- They seemed quite satisfied.
- They seemed satisfied, Mr Vole.
He thinks that he made a statement and that's the end of it. Isn't it obvious that you will be regarded as the principal suspect? I'm afraid you'll be arrested.
I've done nothing!
Why should I be arrested?
This is England! You don't get arrested or convicted for crimes you haven't done.
We try not to make a habit of it.
But it does happen, though, doesn't it?
Of course. There was that case of that fellow, whatshisname, Adolph Beck.
In jail for years and they suddenly found it was another chap.
- He'd been innocent!
- Unfortunate, but restitution was made.
He received a pardon, a bounty from the crown, and was restored to normal life.
That's all right for him. What if it had been murder? What if he'd hanged?
How would they have restored him to his normal life then?
Mr Vole, you must not take such a morbid point of view.
It's just when you say these things are closing in on me, it's like a nightmare.
Relax. You're in the hands of the finest, most experienced barrister in London.
Let's get this straight. I may have done something highly unethical.
I've taken your cigar but I'm not taking your case. I can't.
I'm forbidden. My doctors would never allow it. I'm truly sorry, young man.
But if you'd like the case handled by these chambers,
- I'd recommend Mr Brogan-Moore.
- Yes. A very able man.
- I second Sir Wilfrid's recommendation.
- All right, sir, if you say so.
Hold this.
Carter?
I would like to see Brogan-Moore here as soon as he comes in from court.
Sir Wilfrid, I have never known such insubordination.
Not even as a nurse during the war.
What war was that?
The Crimean War, no doubt.
You'll like Brogan-Moore, he's had excellent training. Under me.
This morning I had no lawyers at all and now suddenly I have three.
We should explain that I have very little money.
I shan't be able to pay all the costs and fees.
We'll get a fourth lawyer to sue you.
He won't get very much.
I haven't had a job in four months.
- What sort of work do you do?
- Well, uh...
My last job was as a mechanic.
The foreman kept riding me all the time.
- I took it as long as I could, then I quit.
- And before that?
I worked in a department store, in toys, demonstrating children's building sets.
Of course, it lasted only during Christmas.
Before that I tested electric blankets.
- Electric blankets?
- I suppose you think I'm a bit of a drifter.
It's true, in a way, but I'm really not like that.
My army service unsettled me. That and living abroad. I was stationed in Germany.
It was fine there, though.
That's where I met my wife.
She was an actress, and a good one.
She's a wonderful wife to me, too.
But I haven't been much of a provider,
I'm afraid.
Somehow, I just don't seem able to settle down now I've come back to this country.
- If I could just put my eggbeater across.
- Eggbeater?
Yes, sir. I, uh, I'm a bit of an inventor.
Nothing big, just little household things.
Pocket pencil sharpeners, key chain flashlights.
But my best is really this eggbeater.
It not only beats, it also separates the yolk from the white.
Is that really desirable?
If you were a housewife, you'd see it right away.
The trouble is, I need money for manufacturing and promotion.
I was really hoping that's what Mrs
French might do for me after I met her.
- Exactly how did you meet Mrs French?
- That's rather funny in itself.
It was 3 September. I remember because it's my wife's birthday.
I was window-shopping in Oxford Street, daydreaming about what I'd buy for her, if I had any money.
- You really like this one?
- Very much.
- You don't think it's too mad?
- Mad?
Not at all. Daring, perhaps. I wouldn't recommend it to every woman. But you?
- Why shouldn't you attract attention?
- You think so?
Absolutely. But if I could suggest one little thing.
Perhaps we could tip it and bring it back a bit like that. Show more of your face.
- My bus. Goodbye.
- Good...
You buy that hat. I insist.
Actually, it was a ridiculous sort of hat - a silly thing with ribbons and flowers.
I'm constantly surprised that women's hats do not provoke more murders.
Go on, please.
I was only trying to be nice to make her feel good.
I never dreamed I'd see her again.
Or the hat.
- But you did?
- Yes, a few weeks later.
Again, by accident. I was peddling my eggbeaters and business was a little slow.
Would you mind, madam? Your hat.
- Oh, it's you!
- Hello!
It's your fault, you know.
You chose it yourself.
- May I?
- Sure, if you like.
Thank you. It's such a bother taking it off and putting it back on again.
That chap is Jesse James. They've led him into an ambush. It's not at all cricket.
- Don't worry, he shoots his way out.
- He does?
- I've seen it. I got to the movies a lot.
- You do?
I get restless so I go out. Then I find
I've no place to go so I go to the movies.
Sometimes I see the same one two or three times. Ooh.
- Toffee?
- Oh, yes, please.
At this time you had no idea that Mrs French was well-off?
No. Absolutely not.
We were sitting in the cheap seats.
All I knew was she seemed to be very lonely, had no friends whatsoever.
She and her husband lived abroad in British Nigeria.
He was in the colonial service.
He died in '45, of a heart attack.
Please, Mayhew, not when I'm smoking.
Go on, young man.
Well, they finally polished off Jesse James, and after we left the movie she invited me to her house for tea.
I think it's the most fascinating thing
I've ever seen. Janet, come and look.
I've seen eggbeaters before, ma'am.
But this beats so quickly and it separates too!
It must be cen-trifugal or centrifugal, which is it?
It's specific gravity, but it whips cream too.
Did you hear that, Janet?
It whips cream too.
We must have one. Is it expensive?
Compliments of the inventor, manufacturer and sole distributor.
Thank you. We'll use it constantly, won't we, Janet?
Come, we'd better get out of here.
Janet doesn't like visitors in her kitchen.
Ha!
It's a bit chilly in here, isn't it?
Shall we have a fire?
Why not?
This is a charming room.
Hubert and I collected all these things when we lived in Africa.
Hubert was my husband.
Well, now, there's a loveable chap.
That's the mask of the witch doctor.
He wore it when he pulled our servants' teeth.
So Hubert used to call him a witch dentist.
- Hubert was so witty.
- Yes, I can see that.
Oh, here's tea.
- Let's use our good silver and china.
- Oh, no, don't bother, Mrs French.
- This is perfectly all right.
- Lemon or milk, please?
- I don't really care.
- Would you prefer sherry?
- That'd be fine.
- We've no' got any.
Oh, but we have. There's that bottle, the one we bought last Christmas.
If you care for an eggnog there's a wasted egg in the kitchen ready and separated.
Do sit down. Don't mind Janet, Mr Vole.
It's just that she's terribly Scotch.
Oh, is she? I thought she came with the collection.
You know, maybe
I'll take a glass of sherry myself.
I feel like Christmas, somehow.
After that I saw her once or twice a week.
She always kept a bottle of sherry for me.
We'd talk, play canasta, listen to gramophone records,
Gilbert and Sullivan mostly.
It's so weird to think of her now, lying in that living room, murdered.
I assure you she's been moved by now.
To leave her would be unfeeling, unlawful, and unsanitary.
Tell Sir Wilfrid about the evening of the murder.
I went around to see her about eight o'clock.
She fixed a sandwich, we talked, listened to The Mikado.
I left about nine. I walked home.
I got there about half past.
I can prove that. I can swear to it, in or out of court, in the witness box, anywhere!
How much money did you get from Mrs French?
- Nothing.
- The truth. How much?
- Why should she give me any money?
- Because she was in love with you.
That's ridiculous. She liked me.
She pampered me like an aunt.
But that's all, I swear.
- Why didn't you tell her you had a wife?
- I did!
But you never took your wife along when you went there. Why not?
- Because...
- Because what?
Because she was under the impression we didn't get along too well.
- Is that true?
- No! We love each other.
- Then how did she get that impression?
- She just seemed to want to believe it.
- You never corrected her. Why?
- I was afraid she'd lose interest.
Because she was rich, and you were after her money.
Well, yes, in a way.
I was hoping for a loan for my new invention. Just a few hundred pounds.
An honest business proposition, that's all.
Is that so wicked?
You knew it was the housekeeper's day off?
- Well, yes.
- You went there because she'd be alone?
No, because I thought she might be lonely.
All right, lonely. You and the rich lonely widow all alone in that house with a gramophone blaring The Mikado.
Perhaps you turned up the volume to drown her cries.
- When I left her she was alive!
- When Janet came back she was dead.
The house had been ransacked! It said in the papers. It must've been a burglar.
I didn't do it. No matter how bad things look, I didn't do it!
You must believe me.
You do believe me, don't you?
I do now, but I wasn't sure.
That's why I subjected your eyes and my arteries to that ordeal.
- I'm sorry.
- That's all right.
As for things looking bad, they don't look bad, Mr Vole, they look terrible.
- Apparently you've no alibi at all.
- But I have. I left Mrs French's at nine.
- By bus or underground?
- No, I walked. It was a fine night.
- Did anyone see you?
- Christine saw me when I got home.
It was 9.26. I know because I went right to work on a clock I've been tinkering with.
- My wife will tell you.
- Your wife loves you, yes?
Very much.
We're devoted to each other.
You realise, Mr Vole, the testimony of a devoted wife does not carry much weight.
People might think
Christine would lie on my account?
It has been known, Mr Vole.
Blood is thicker than evidence.
- Ah, Brogan-Moore. Come in, come in.
- So good to have you out of hospital.
I didn't get a full pardon, I'm out on parole. You know Mr Mayhew, I believe.
- This is his client, Mr Leonard Vole.
- How do you do?
- How do you do?
- The Emily French murder.
- Oh, how do you do?
- Badly, thank you.
A mass of circumstantial evidence.
No alibi whatsoever. It's a hot potato.
- Tossing it into your lap.
- Much obliged.
Your line of defence, however, will be lack of motive.
You will agree that we can rule out a crime of passion, hm?
That leaves us with a murder for profit.
If Mr Vole had been sponging off Mrs
French, why cut off the source of supply?
Or, if he'd been hoping for a golden egg, why kill the goose before it was laid?
No motive. No motive whatsoever.
- You find some flaw in this reasoning?
- No, no, it's very sound as far as it goes.
Well, it's all yours. You'll find Mr Vole very responsive and quite candid.
So candid, he's already told me we'll have to sue him for our fees.
Oh, we'll simply put a lean on Mr Vole's £80,000.
- What £80,000?
- The £80,000 Mrs French left you.
Left me?
They opened Mrs French's bank vault today and found her will.
- Congratulations.
And I was worried about a couple of hundred for that silly eggbeater.
I must call Christine.
Oh.
This doesn't make things look any better for me, does it?
- No. I wouldn't think so.
- So now they'll say I did have a motive.
They will indeed. £80,000 makes for a very handsome motive.
I thought you were crazy but now they will arrest me!
It's not unlikely.
As a matter of fact, it's quite likely.
They're on their way up now.
I knew nothing about that will. I'd no idea she'd any intention of leaving me money.
- If I didn't know, how can it be a motive?
- We'll certainly bring that out in court.
- It's our old friend Inspector Hearne.
- Chief Inspector as of last month.
Chief Inspector? They must think a lot of you at Scotland Yard.
You're getting the de luxe treatment.
- Oh, in here, Chief Inspector.
- Sorry to disturb you in your chambers.
That's perfectly all right.
I never object to the actions of the police
- except once in a great while in court.
- Yes, sir, I still have the scars.
You know Mr Mayhew, Mr Brogan-Moore.
This is Leonard Vole. You'd better search him, he may be armed with an eggbeater.
- Is your name Leonard Vole?
- Yes, it is.
I have a warrant for your arrest on the charge of murdering Emily French.
I must warn you that anything you say may be taken down and used in evidence.
Well, I'm ready. Must I be handcuffed?
That won't be necessary, sir.
I've never been arrested before, not even for walking a dog off a lead
- or having a beer after hours.
- There's no disgrace in being arrested.
Kings, prime ministers, archbishops, even barristers have stood in the dock.
- Somebody better call my wife.
- I will, don't worry.
I'll go too, see you're properly charged.
- You will see to it that he is well-treated?
- We will.
Would you like a cigar? Pardon me.
- That's very kind of you, Sir Wilfrid.
- I'd better not. It would constitute a bribe.
We ought to be going, Mr Vole.
One thing I've learned for sure, never look in a window with women's hats.
Good day, sir.
Makes a very nice impression, doesn't he?
- Yes, rather. Give him the monocle test?
- Passed with flying colours.
I hope he does as well in the dock.
This is sticky, you know.
Of course. The prosecution will blast in with their heaviest artillery.
All you'll have is one little popgun, an alibi furnished by his wife.
Isn't that an intriguing challenge?
I think I'd like it more if it was less of a challenge and less intriguing.
Miss Plimsoll has issued an ultimatum.
In bed in one minute or she'll resign.
Splendid. Give her a month's pay and kick her down the stairs.
Either you take care of yourself or I, too, shall resign.
This is blackmail.
But you're quite right.
For my first day this has already been rather hectic. I should be in bed.
I'd better get in touch with Mrs Vole and have her come over. Will you sit in?
Thank you, no. I'm in no condition to cope with emotional wives drenched in tears.
Miss Plimsoll, how alluring you look, waiting like a hangman on the scaffold.
Take me, I'm yours.
Oh!
About Mrs Vole. Handle her gently, especially when you tell her of the arrest.
Bear in mind she's a foreigner, so prepare for hysterics, even a fainting spell.
Better have smelling salts ready, box of tissues and a nip of brandy.
I do not think that will be necessary.
I never faint in case I don't fall gracefully, and I never use smelling salts because they puff up the eyes.
I'm Christine Vole.
How do you do?
This is Mr Brogan-Moore.
How do you do?
- I am Wilfrid Robarts.
- How do you do?
My dear Mrs Vole, I'm afraid we have bad news for you.
- Don't be afraid, I'm quite disciplined.
- There's nothing to be alarmed about yet.
Leonard has been arrested and charged with murder. Is that it?
- Yes.
- I knew he would be, I told him so.
I'm glad you're showing such fortitude.
Call it what you like.
What is the next step?
Your husband will have to stand trial, I'm afraid.
Will you explain the procedure?
Mr Brogan-Moore will lead the defence.
Oh?
- You will not defend Leonard?
- Regrettably not.
My health, or, rather, the lack of it, forbids me.
It is regrettable. Mr Mayhew described you as champion of the hopeless cause.
Is it, perhaps, that this cause is too hopeless?
I'll have a serious talk with Dr Harrison. It was a mistake to let you come back here.
I should have taken you to a rest-home or a resort.
Some place quiet, far off, like Bermuda.
Shut up. You just want to see me in those nasty shorts.
Come now, Sir Wilfrid, you must not think of it.
You must get ready for sleep, think beautiful thoughts.
Now, let's get undressed. Put these on, tops and bottoms, while I make your bed.
After your rest we'll have a nice cup of cocoa.
Then perhaps we'll have a walk around the square.
You know, I feel sorry for that nice Mr Vole.
And not just because he was arrested, but that wife of his. She must be German.
That's what happens when we let our boys cross the Channel. They go crazy.
The government should do something about foreign wives. Like an embargo.
How else can we take care of our own surplus. Don't you agree, Sir Wilfrid?
All right. Hop in!
Sir Wilfrid?
Sir Wilfrid!
Come back!
Yes, of course I knew that Leonard had been seeing Mrs French quite frequently.
Go on.
I knew when he came home with a pair of green socks she'd knitted for him.
That's quite natural.
I'm sure a jury will find it endearing.
Leonard can be very endearing.
He hates that particular shade of green and the socks were two sizes too large, but he wore them just the same to give her pleasure.
Leonard has a way with women.
I only hope he has an all-woman jury.
They will carry him from court in triumph.
A simple acquittal will do. Now, you know
Mrs French left your husband money?
Yes. A lot of money.
Of course, your husband had no previous knowledge of this bequest?
Is that what he told you?
Surely you're not suggesting different?
Oh, no, no. I do not suggest anything.
Clearly, she had come to look upon your husband as a son or favourite nephew.
You think Mrs French looked upon Leonard as a son? Or a nephew?
I do. An entirely natural and understandable relationship.
What hypocrites you are in this country.
Pardon me, Brogan-Moore.
- Do you mind if I ask you a question?
- Go right ahead, Sir Wilfrid.
You realise your husband's entire defence rests on his word and yours?
- I realise that.
- And that the jury will be quite sceptical of the word of a man accused of murder when supported only by that of his wife?
- I realise that too.
- Let us, then, at least make sure
- the two are not in conflict.
- By all means, let's.
I assume you want to help your husband?
Of course I want to help Leonard. I want to help Mr Brogan-Moore and to help you.
There. Isn't that more comfortable for you?
Now, Mrs Vole. This is very important.
On the night of the murder your husband came home before 9.30. Correct?
Precisely. Isn't that what he wants me to say?
Isn't it the truth?
Of course.
But when I told the police,
I do not think they believed me.
Maybe I didn't say it well.
Maybe because of my accent.
My dear Mrs Vole, in our courts we accept the evidence of witnesses who speak only Bulgarian and who must have an interpreter.
We accept the evidence of deaf-mutes who cannot speak at all, as long as they tell the truth.
You're aware that when you're in the witness box you will be sworn
- and you will testify under oath?
- Yes.
Leonard came home at 9.26 precisely and did not go out again.
The truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. Is that better?
- Mrs Vole, do you love your husband?
- Leonard thinks I do.
- Well, do you?
- Am I already under oath?
Whatever your gambit may be, do you know that, under British law, you cannot be called to give testimony damaging to your husband?
How very convenient.
We are dealing with a capital crime.
The prosecution will try to hang your husband.
He is not my husband.
Leonard and I went through a form of marriage, but I had a husband living somewhere in East Germany, in the Russian zone.
- Did you tell Leonard?
- I did not. It would have been stupid.
He would not have married me and
I'd have been left to starve in the rubble.
But he did marry you and brought you safely here.
Don't you think you should be grateful?
One can get very tired of gratitude.
Your husband loves you very much, does he not?
Leonard?
He worships the ground I walk on.
And you?
You want to know too much.
Auf Wiedersehen, gentlemen.
Thank you for coming in, Mrs Vole.
Your visit has been most reassuring.
Do not worry, Sir Wilfrid. I will give him an alibi and I shall be very convincing.
There will be tears in my eyes when I say
"Leonard came home at 9.26 precisely."
You're a very remarkable woman,
Mrs Vole.
And you're satisfied, I hope?
- I'm damned if I'm satisfied!
- Care for a whiff of those smelling salts?
That woman's up to something. But what?
The prosecution will break her down in no time when she's in the witness box.
This case is going to be rather like the charge of the Light Brigade or one of those Japanese suicide pilots.
Quite one-sided.
With the odds all on the other side.
I haven't got much to go on, have I?
The fact is, I've got nothing.
Let me ask you something.
Do you believe Leonard Vole is innocent?
Do you?
Do you?
I'm not sure.
Oh, I'm sorry, Wilfrid.
Of course, I'll do my best.
It's all right, Brogan-Moore.
I'll take it from here.
I have called Dr Harrison and given him a report on your shocking behaviour.
- Give me a match, Miss Plimsoll.
- Sir Wilfrid!
Did you hear me? A match!
Mr Mayhew. Sir Wilfrid. I'm told you are going to represent me. I'm very grateful.
I struck a bargain with my doctors. They exile me to Bermuda as soon as we finish.
- Thank you.
- There's hope that we'll both survive.
- Get into these. We need a photograph.
- Why?
This is what you were wearing that night.
We'll circulate a photo on the chance that someone saw you on your way home.
Over here against the wall, please.
Hold it.
One more in profile, please.
Do we really need this? My wife knows what time I came home that night.
A disinterested witness may be of more value.
Yes, of course,
Christine is an interested witness.
I'll pick up the negatives later. Thank you.
I don't understand it.
Why hasn't she come to see me?
Won't they let her see me?
I mean, it's been two weeks now.
Mayhew, give me the reports.
Have you been talking to her?
Is there something the matter?
I want to read a portion of the evidence of Janet McKenzie, the housekeeper.
"Mr Vole helped Mrs French with her business affairs, particularly her income tax returns."
Oh, yes, I did. Some of those forms are very complicated.
There's also a hint you may have helped her draft her new will.
Well, that's not true!
If Janet said that she's lying.
She was always against me,
I don't know why!
It's obvious. You threw an eggbeater into the wheels of her Victorian household.
Now, this cut in your wrist.
You say you cut yourself with a knife?
Well, that's true, I did.
I was cutting bread and the knife slipped.
But that was two days after. Christine was there. She'll tell them in her evidence.
Are you keeping something from me?
Is she ill? Was she shocked?
All things considered, she took it well.
Though that may be only on the surface.
Wives are often profoundly disturbed at such a time.
Yes, it must be hard.
We've never been separated before.
- Not since our first meeting.
- How did you meet your wife, Mr Vole?
In Germany in 1945.
It's rather funny. The very first time
I saw her, the ceiling fell right in on me.
I was stationed outside Hamburg,
with an RAF maintenance unit.
I'd just installed a shower in the officers'
billet, so they gave me a weekend pass.
Come on!
? Join the party
? Have a hearty glass of rum
? Don't ever think about tomorrow
? For tomorrow may never come
? When I find me a happy place
? That's where I wanna stay
? Time is nothing as long as I'm living it up this way
? I may never go home any more
? Dim the lights and start locking the door
? Give your arms to me
Give your charms to me
? After all that's what sailors are for
? I've got kisses and kisses galore
? That have never been tasted before
? If you treat me right
This could be the night
? I may never go home
? I may never go home
? I may never go home
? I may never go home
? I may never go home any more
? I may never go home any more
Hey, Fräulein, show us some legs.
They rob you blind and then throw you a ruddy sailor!
- Come on, let's see 'em.
- We want legs!
Come help the cabaret out of her trousers!
All right, Fräulein, if you won't show 'em, I will.
All right, outside, everybody.
Come on, let's go.
Come on.
Bring him round to the other truck.
We'll be back, baby! We'll be back!
Gesundheit.
- What are you looking for?
- My accordion.
Oh, let me help you.
- I think I found it.
- Step on it again, it's still breathing.
I'm terribly sorry.
You better go. We've had trouble enough.
Well, it's your own fault. That costume in the picture gave the boys ideas
- then those trousers let them down hard.
- That costume went in the first raid.
Then raid by raid, my other dresses, and now you've bombed my trousers.
Cigarette? Gum?
You're burning my nose.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- That's all right.
How about a cup of coffee?
I've got a tin of coffee.
How much?
I don't know.
What's the rate of exchange?
- Depends whether it's fresh or powdered.
- It's instant coffee.
Got any hot water at your place?
- Sometimes.
- Let's take a chance. Where do you live?
Nearby.
Come.
Sorry, it's the maid's night off.
This is pretty horrible.
In a gemütlich sort of way.
Oh, it's fine now.
I used to have a roommate. A dancer.
She had luck, she married a Canadian.
She now lives in Toronto.
She has a Ford automobile.
Make yourself comfortable, the stove is slow these days.
That's all right, I've got a weekend pass.
No, not that chair. It holds up the beam and that holds up the ceiling.
You'd better sit down on the cot.
The cot?
Getting more gemütlich all the time.
Are you married?
- Why?
- Well, the, um...
Oh, that. No, no, I'm not married.
I just wear it when I'm working.
Gives a little protection with all the men.
- Didn't work too well tonight, did it?
- No, tonight was bad.
But it's getting better.
- Where's the coffee?
- Ah, coffee, ja voll.
Finest Brazilian blend. The same brand that Field Marshal Montgomery drinks.
Is that a fair rate of exchange?
Very fair.
Would you be interested in having the whole tin?
I would.
- How are you fixed for sugar?
- I could use some.
Milk?
Sure.
Milk. Sugar.
It's a pleasure to do business with you.
Yeah.
I also carry biscuits, powdered eggs,
- bacon, marmalade.
- I don't know if I can afford it.
Don't worry, we'll work out something, like an instalment plan.
? I may never go home any more
I'm terribly sorry.
Now you have no ceiling.
- Maybe I can fix it, I'm good at it.
- Why fix it? It's not raining.
Ooh.
- Are you all right?
- I think so. My head aches a little.
Maybe I can fix it.
I'm good at it.
I had a weekend pass, a month's pay in my pocket.
- And she already had a wedding ring.
- Yes, that's right.
We got married. When I got out of the service I brought her here.
It was wonderful.
I rented a little flat, Edgware Road.
First time she saw it, she was so happy she broke down and cried.
Naturally. She had a solid roof over her head and a British passport.
You don't know her, how she feels about me. You will when she gives evidence.
Mr Vole, I must tell you
I am not putting her in the witness box.
You're not? Why not?
She's a foreigner, unfamiliar with the subtleties of our language.
The prosecution could easily trip her up.
I hear it may be Mr Myers for the crown.
We can't take chances.
Quite. We'd better be going. Miss Plimsoll is waiting in the car with her pills
- and a Thermos of lukewarm cocoa.
- Officer.
- But Christine must give evidence.
- Mr Vole, you must learn to trust me.
For no other reason than I'm a mean, ill-tempered old man who hates to lose.
Let us wish each other luck.
Look, I can't face this without Christine.
I tell you, I need her. Without her I'm sunk.
Touching, isn't it?
The way he counts on his wife.
Yes. Like a drowning man clutching at a razor blade.
Leonard Stephen Vole, you are charged on indictment for that you, on the 14th day of October, in the county of London, murdered Emily Jane French.
How say you, Leonard Stephen Vole?
Are you guilty or not guilty?
Not guilty.
Members of the jury, the prisoner stands indicted for that he, on the 14th day of October, murdered Emily Jane French.
To this indictment he has pleaded not guilty.
And it is your charge to say, having heard the evidence, whether he be guilty or not.
Members of the jury, by the oath which you have just taken, you have sworn to try this case on the evidence.
You must shut out from your minds everything except what will take place in this court.
You may proceed for the prosecution, Mr Myers.
May it please you, my lord.
Members of the jury,
I appear in this case with my learned friend, Mr Barton, for the prosecution.
And my learned friends
Sir Wilfrid Robarts and Mr Brogan-Moore appear for the defence.
I trust we are not to be deprived of the learned and stimulating presence of Sir Wilfrid?
My lord, may I assure my learned friend that Sir Wilfrid is in the Old Bailey.
He's slightly incapacitated, but will be in his seat presently.
My lord, may I express my regret that
Sir Wilfrid is even slightly incapacitated.
You may, Mr Myers. You may also proceed with the case for the prosecution.
Thank you, my lord.
The facts in this case are simple and, to a point, not in dispute.
You will hear how the prisoner made the acquaintance of Mrs Emily French, a woman of 56.
How he was treated by her with kindness and even affection.
On the night of October 14 last, between 9.30 and 10,
Mrs French was murdered.
Medical testimony will be introduced to prove that death was caused by a blow from a blunt and heavy instrument, and it is the case for the prosecution that the blow was dealt by the prisoner, Leonard Vole.
That's not true! I didn't do it!
Among the witnesses, you will hear police evidence, also the evidence of Mrs French's housekeeper, Janet McKenzie, and from the medical and laboratory experts, and the evidence of the murdered woman's solicitor, who drew her final will.
I now call Chief Inspector Hearne,
Criminal Investigation Department,
- New Scotland Yard.
- Chief Inspector Hearne.
- Chief Inspector Hearne.
- Chief Inspector Hearne.
This is ridiculous. Just nervous heartburn.
I always get it the first day of a trial.
240 above 130.
You shouldn't be here at all.
- I should be in court, the trial's begun.
- Syringe, please.
Be a good, brave boy, Sir Wilfrid.
It may interest you to know that I am descended from a warrior family which traces its brave past back to Richard the Lion-Hearted.
You're to have a calcium injection daily,
- tranquillising pill every hour.
- I'll set my wristwatch alarm.
Any pain or shortness of breath, pop one of these nitroglycerin tablets under your tongue.
Oh, and I'll leave you some...
That's enough, Doctor.
The judge will be asking for a saliva test.
Carter, I'd better take that Thermos of cocoa with me.
- Helps me wash down the pills.
- Let me see it, please.
My learned patient is not above substituting brandy for cocoa.
It is cocoa. So sorry.
If you were a woman, Miss Plimsoll,
I would strike you.
Take care of this, Carter.
Now, Sir Wilfrid, in the courtroom, you must avoid overexcitement.
Yes, Doctor, yes, yes.
Watch your temper.
Keep your blood pressure down.
Thank you, Doctor, I shall be quite safe, what with the pills and the cocoa.
Come along, Carter.
From the body temperature and other factors, we placed the time of death at between 9.30 and 10pm, approximately 30 minutes before Janet
McKenzie returned home and called us.
Death was instantaneous, caused by one blow from a heavy and blunt instrument.
Were there any signs of a struggle?
None. Just the one blow.
Would that indicate that the murderer had taken Mrs French by surprise?
My lord, I must object.
My learned friend refers to the assailant as "the murderer".
We have not yet determined whether the assailant was a man or a woman.
It could quite conceivably have been "the murderess".
Mr Myers, Sir Wilfrid has joined us just in time to catch you on a point of grammar.
Please rephrase your question.
Yes, my lord. Inspector, is it your opinion that the assailant, whether he, she or it, had taken Mrs French by surprise?
My lord, I am taken by surprise that my learned friend should try to solicit from the witness an opinion, not a fact.
Quite so. You'll have to do better than that, Mr Myers.
My lord, I withdraw the question entirely.
- Is that better?
- That's much better.
Silence! Silence!
Very well, Inspector, let us proceed with the facts.
After establishing the cause and the time of death, what did you then do?
A search was made, photographs were taken and the premises fingerprinted.
- What fingerprints did you discover?
- I found the fingerprints of Mrs French, those of Janet McKenzie, and some which later proved to be those of Leonard Vole.
- No others?
- No others.
Did you say the room had the appearance that a robbery had been committed?
Yes. Things were strewn about and the window had been broken near the catch.
There was glass on the floor, and fragments were found outside.
The glass outside was not consistent with the window being forced from the outside.
You're saying that someone made it look as if it had been forced from the outside?
My lord, I must object. My learned friend is putting words in the witness' mouth.
After all, if he insists on answering his own questions, the presence of the witness would seem superfluous.
Quite. Don't you think so, Mr Myers?
Yes, my lord.
Inspector, did you ascertain if any of the murdered woman's property was missing?
According to the housekeeper, nothing was missing.
In your experience, Inspector, when burglars or burglaresses break into a house, do they leave without taking anything?
No, sir.
- Do you produce a jacket, Inspector?
- Yes, sir.
Is that the jacket?
- Yes, sir.
- That is exhibit P1, my lord.
Where did you find this, Inspector?
That is the jacket found in the prisoner's flat, which I handed to our lab to test for bloodstains.
- And did you find any bloodstains?
- Yes.
Though an attempt had been made to wash them out.
What tests were made?
First to determine if the stains were human blood, then to classify it by group or type.
And was the blood of a particular group or type?
Yes, sir. It is type O.
And did you subsequently test the blood of the dead woman?
- Yes, sir.
- What type was that?
The same. Type O.
Thank you, Inspector.
No further questions.
Inspector, you say the only fingerprints you found were those of Mrs French,
Janet McKenzie and Leonard Vole.
In your experience, when a burglar breaks in, does he usually leave fingerprints
- or does he wear gloves?
- He wears gloves.
So the absence of fingerprints in a robbery
- would hardly surprise you?
- No, sir.
Can't we surmise the burglar might have entered a presumably empty house, suddenly encountered
Mrs French and struck her, then, realising she was dead, fled without taking anything?
I submit, my lord, that it is entirely impossible to guess what went on in the mind of some entirely imaginary burglar.
With or without gloves.
Let us not surmise, Sir Wilfrid, but confine ourselves to facts.
Inspector, when you questioned the prisoner as to the stains on his jacket, did he not show you a recently-healed scar on his wrist,
- saying he had cut himself slicing bread?
- Yes, sir, that is what he said.
And were you not told the same thing by his wife?
- Yes, sir. But afterwards...
- Just a simple yes or no, please.
Did the prisoner's wife show you a knife and tell you that her husband had cut his wrist while slicing bread?
- Yes, sir.
- I will ask you to examine this knife.
Just test the edge of it with your finger. Carefully!
You agree that the point and the cutting edge are razor-sharp?
- Yes, sir.
- Now, if such a knife were to slip, might it not inflict a cut that would bleed profusely?
Yes, sir, it might.
Inspector, you stated that the bloodstains on the prisoner's jacket were analysed, as was the blood of Mrs French, and they were both found to be of group O.
- That is correct.
- However, if the prisoner's blood were also of this same group, then the stains on his jacket may well have resulted from the household accident he described to you.
Yes, sir.
Did you examine the prisoner's blood, Inspector?
No, sir.
I have here a certificate stating that Leonard Stephen Vole is a blood donor at the North London Hospital.
And that his blood is group O.
Thank you, Inspector.
Inspector, granted that the cut on the wrist was caused by that knife, is there anything to show whether it was an accident or done deliberately after the murder to account for the bloodstains?
- Oh, really, my lord!
- I withdraw the question.
You may stand down.
- Call Janet McKenzie.
- Janet McKenzie.
- Janet McKenzie.
- Janet McKenzie.
I swear by Almighty God that the evidence...
...the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.
Carter. Carter. Pill. Pill.
- Your name is Janet McKenzie?
- Aye, that's my name.
- When did you first come to London?
- That was many years ago. 28 years ago.
- Where do you live?
- Now that Mrs French, poor soul, is dead,
I've moved in with my niece at 19 Glenister Road.
You were companion-housekeeper to the late Mrs Emily French?
I was her housekeeper!
I've no opinion of companions, poor feckless bodies, afraid of a bit of honest domestic work.
I meant you were on friendly terms, not altogether those of mistress and servant.
Aye. Ten years I was with her and looked after her.
She knew me and she trusted me.
Many's the time
I prevented her doing a foolish thing.
Please tell us, in your own words, about the events of the evening of October 14.
It was a Friday and my night out. I was going to see my niece at Glenister Road, which is about five minutes' walk.
I left the house at half past seven.
I promised to take her a dress pattern that she admired.
- Och, is this thing necessary?
- An excellent question.
However, it has been installed at considerable expense to the taxpayers, so let us take advantage of it.
Please continue.
Well, when I got to my niece's,
I found I'd left the pattern behind.
So after supper I slipped back to get it as it was no distance.
I got back to the house at 25 past 9.
I let myself in and went upstairs to my room.
As I passed the sitting room, I heard the prisoner in there, talking to Mrs French.
No, it wasn't me! It wasn't my voice!
Talking and laughing they were.
But it was no business of mine, so I went upstairs to fetch my pattern.
Now, let us be very exact as to the time.
You say that you re-entered the house at 25 past 9?
Aye. The pattern was on a shelf in my room next to my clock so I saw the time.
- And it was 25 past 9.
- Go on, please.
I went back to my niece. Och, she was delighted with the pattern. Si...
Simply delighted. I stayed until 20 to 11, then I said good night and I come home.
I went into the sitting room to see if the mistress wanted anything before she went to bed.
And there she was, dead.
And everything tossed hither and thither.
Did you really think that a burglary had been committed?
My lord, I must protest!
I will not allow that question to be answered, Mr Myers.
Miss McKenzie, were you aware that Leonard Vole was a married man?
No, indeed.
And neither was the mistress.
- Janet!
- My lord, I must object.
What Mrs French knew or did not know is pure conjecture on Janet McKenzie's part.
Let me put it this way.
You formed the opinion that Mrs French thought
Leonard Vole was a single man?
- Have you any facts to support this?
- The books that she ordered.
A life of the Baroness Burdett-Coutts, and the one about Disraeli and his wife.
Both of them about women that married men years younger than themselves. Oh!
- I knew what she was thinking.
- I'm afraid we cannot admit that.
Why?
Members of the jury, it is possible for a woman to read The Life of Disraeli without contemplating marriage with a man younger than herself.
Were you aware of the arrangements Mrs
French made to dispose of her money?
She had her old will revoked and a new one drawn up.
I heard her calling Mr Stokes, her solicitor.
He was there at the time.
The prisoner, I mean.
You heard Mrs French and the prisoner discussing her new will?
Yes. He was to have all her money, she told him, as she had no near relations nor anybody that meant to her what he did.
- When did this take place?
- On October 8.
One week to the day before she was murdered.
Thank you.
That concludes my examination.
Not just yet, Miss McKenzie.
Would you...? Thank you.
Miss McKenzie, you have given evidence about two wills.
In the old will, that which was revoked, were you not to receive the bulk of Mrs French's estate?
That's so.
Whereas in the new will, except for a bequest to you of a small annuity, the principal beneficiary is the prisoner, Leonard Vole.
It'll be a wicked injustice if he ever touches a penny of that money.
It is entirely understandable that you are antagonistic to the prisoner.
I'm not antagonistic to him.
He's a shiftless, scheming rascal.
But I'm not antagonistic to him.
I suggest you formed this opinion because his friendship with Mrs French cost you the bulk of her estate.
- I've never liked him.
- Your candour is refreshing.
Now. On the night of October 14 you say you heard the prisoner and Mrs French talking together.
- What did you hear them say?
- I didn't hear what they actually said.
You mean you only heard the voices?
- The murmur of voices?
- They were laughing.
What makes you say the man's voice was Leonard Vole's?
- I know his voice well enough.
- The door was closed, was it not?
- Aye, that's so.
- You were in a hurry to get the pattern so you probably walked quickly past the closed door, yet you are sure you heard Leonard Vole's voice?
I was there long enough to hear what I heard.
Come, I'm sure you don't wish to suggest to the jury that you were eavesdropping.
It was him in there.
Who else could it have been?
What you mean is that you wanted it to be him. That's the way your mind worked.
Now, tell me, did Mrs French sometimes watch television in the evening?
Yes. She was fond of a talk or a good play.
Wasn't it possible when you returned home and passed the door, what you really heard was the television and a man and woman's voices and laughter?
There was a play called Lover's Leap on the television that night.
- It was not the television.
- Oh, why not?
Because the television was away being repaired that week, that's why.
Silence! Silence!
Odd. It's not time yet.
If my learned friend has no further questions, I'd like...
I have not quite finished.
You are registered, are you not, under the National Health Insurance Act?
Aye, that's so.
Four and sixpence I pay out every week.
That's a terrible lot of money for a working woman to pay.
I am sure that many agree with you.
Miss McKenzie, did you recently apply to the National Health Insurance for...
-... a hearing aid?
- For... for what?
I protest against the way in which this question was put!
I will repeat the question, my lord.
I asked you in a normal tone of voice, audible to everyone in open court, did you apply to the National Health
Insurance for a hearing aid?
Yes, I did.
- Did you get it?
- Not yet.
However, you state that you walked past a door, which is four inches of solid oak, you heard voices, and you are willing to swear that you could distinguish the voice of...
... the prisoner, Leonard Vole.
Who? Who?
No further questions.
Och, maybe you could help me,
Your Lordship.
Six months ago I applied for my hearing aid, and I'm still waiting for it.
My dear Miss McKenzie, considering the rubbish that is being talked nowadays, you are missing very little.
You may stand down now.
Call Police Constable Jeffries.
- Police Constable Jeffries.
- Police Constable Jeffries.
I swear by Almighty God that the evidence I shall give shall be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.
Mr Myers, does that conclude your case?
No, my lord. I now call the final witness for the prosecution, Christine Helm.
- Christine Helm!
- Christine Helm.
Christine.
I swear by Almighty God that the evidence I shall give shall be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.
My lord, I have the most serious objection to this witness being summoned, as she is the wife of the prisoner.
I call my learned friend's attention to the fact that I summoned not Mrs Vole, but Mrs Helm.
- Your name, in fact, is Christine Helm?
- Yes. Christine Helm.
And you have been living as the wife of the prisoner, Leonard Vole?
- Yes.
- Are you actually his wife?
No.
I went through a marriage ceremony with him, but I already had a husband.
- He's still alive.
- Christine, that's not true!
There is proof of a marriage between the witness and the prisoner, but is there any proof of a so-called previous marriage?
My lord, the so-called previous marriage is, in fact, well-documented.
Mrs Helm, is this a certificate of marriage between yourself and Otto Ludwig Helm, the ceremony having taken place in Breslau on 18 April 1942?
Yes, that is the paper of my marriage.
I don't see any reason why this witness should not be qualified to give evidence.
You're willing to give evidence against the man you've been calling your husband?
Yes.
You stated to the police that on the night that Mrs French was murdered,
Leonard Vole left the house at 7.30 and returned at 25 minutes past 9.
Did he, in fact, return at 25 past 9?
No. He returned at ten minutes past ten.
Christine, what are you saying?
It's not true. You know it's not true!
Silence!
I must have silence.
As your counsel will tell you,
Vole, you will very shortly have an opportunity of speaking in your own defence.
Leonard Vole returned, you say, at ten minutes past ten.
- And what happened next?
- He was breathing hard, very excited.
He threw off his coat and examined the sleeves.
Then he told me to wash the cuffs.
- They had blood on them.
- Go on.
- I said "What have you done?"
- What did the prisoner say?
He said "I've killed her."
Christine! Why are you lying?
Why are you saying these things?
- What an awful woman.
- She's evil. I've known it all along.
If the defence so desires,
I will adjourn for a short time so that the prisoner may gain control of himself.
My lord is most gracious, but pray let the witness continue.
We are all of us caught up in the suspense of this horror fiction.
To have to hear it in instalments might prove unendurable.
- Proceed, Mr Myers.
- Mrs Helm, when the prisoner said "I have killed her", did you know to whom he referred?
It was that woman he had been seeing so often.
When questioned by the police, you told them that the prisoner returned at 9.25.
Yes. Because Leonard asked me to say that.
But you've changed your story now. Why?
I cannot go on lying to save him.
I said to the police what he wanted because I'm grateful to him.
He married me and brought me to this country.
What he has asked me to do I have because I was grateful.
It was not because he was your husband and you loved him?
I never loved him.
It was gratitude, then, that prompted you to give him an alibi
- in your statement to the police?
- That is it. Exactly.
- But now you think it was wrong to do so.
- Because it is murder.
That woman, she was a harmless old fool, and he makes of me an accomplice to the murder.
I cannot come into court and swear that he was with me at the time it was done.
I cannot do it! I cannot do it!
Then this is the truth?
That Leonard Vole returned that night at ten minutes past ten, he had blood on the sleeves of his coat, and that he said to you
"I have killed her"?
That is the truth.
That is the truth, before God?
That is the truth.
Thank you.
Mrs Vole, or Mrs Helm, which do you prefer to be called?
- It does not matter.
- Does it not?
In this country we are inclined to take a rather more serious view of marriage.
However, it would appear that when you first met the prisoner in Hamburg
- you lied to him about your marital status.
- I wanted to get out of Germany, so...
You lied, did you not?
Just yes or no, please.
- Yes.
- Thank you.
And in arranging the marriage, you lied to the authorities?
I, um, did not tell the truth to the authorities.
- You lied to them?
- Yes.
And in the ceremony, when you swore to love, honour and cherish your husband,
- that too was a lie?
- Yes.
And when the police questioned you about this wretched man who believed himself married and loved,
- you told them...
- I told them what he wanted me to.
You told them that he was at home with you at 25 minutes past 9,
- and now you say that that was a lie?
- Yes, a lie!
And when you said that he had accidentally cut his wrist, again, you lied?
- Yes!
- And today you told a new story entirely.
The question is, Frau Helm, were you lying then, are you lying now?
Or are you not, in fact, a chronic and habitual liar?!
Carter, Carter!
The other pill. Under the tongue.
My lord, is my learned friend to be allowed to bully and insult the witness?
Mr Myers, this is a capital charge and, within the bounds of reason,
I should like the defence to have every latitude.
My lord, may I also remind my learned friend that his witness, by her own admission, has already violated so many oaths that I am surprised the Testament did not leap from her hand when she was sworn here today.
I doubt if anything is to be gained by questioning you any further.
That will be all, Frau Helm.
Mrs Helm, I presume you know the meaning of the English word "perjury"?
- In German, the word is Meineid.
- Yes. Meineid.
It means to swear falsely under oath.
And are you aware, Mrs Helm, that the penalty in this country for perjury is a heavy term of imprisonment?
Yes, I'm aware.
Mindful of this fact, I ask you once more, is the evidence that you have given the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth?
So help me, God.
Then that, my lord, is the case for the prosecution.
- Want a tissue?
- Yes, thanks.
It's the first murder trial
I've ever been to. It's terrible.
Silence.
Sir Wilfrid.
Are you ready for the defence?
My lord, members of the jury, the prosecution has very ably presented against the prisoner, Leonard Vole, a case with the most overwhelming circumstantial evidence.
Among the witnesses you have heard
Chief Inspector Hearne, who has given his testimony in a fair and impartial manner, as he always does.
He has put before you a clever theory of how this crime was committed.
Whether it is theory or actual fact, however, you will decide for yourselves.
And then you have heard the evidence of Janet McKenzie, a worthy and devoted housekeeper who has suffered two most grievous losses.
One, the death of her beloved mistress and, second, in being deprived of an inheritance of £80,000, which she'd fully expected to receive.
I will not comment further on her evidence, but will express only my deepest sympathy for her in both these... mishaps.
And most damaging of all, the prosecution has produced a surprise witness, one Christine Helm, whom the prisoner brought from the rubble of her homeland to the safety of this country, giving her his love and the protection of his name.
I objected to her testimony because a wife cannot give evidence
harmful to her husband.
But it has been proven that her marriage to Mr Vole was fraudulent and bigamous.
Therefore, her evidence must be admitted and you must consider it.
For what it is worth.
Such is the prosecution's case.
Now it is the turn of the defence.
We could present, on behalf of the prisoner, witnesses to his character, his war record, the lack of criminal or evil association in his past.
However, only one witness can shed new light on this tragic riddle.
The prisoner himself.
Members of the jury,
I call Leonard Stephen Vole.
I swear by Almighty God that the evidence I give will be the truth,
- the whole truth and nothing but the truth.
- No.
- Is your name Leonard Stephen Vole?
- It is.
- Where do live?
- 620 Edgware Road.
Leonard Stephen Vole, did you or did you not on the night of October 14 last, murder Emily Jane French?
- I did not.
- Thank you, that will be all.
Have you, in fact, concluded your examination of the prisoner, Sir Wilfrid?
The prisoner has endured three days of profound mental agony and shock.
The defence feels his faculties should be spared for the cross-examination by my learned friend for the prosecution.
This is not a plea for any indulgence.
I am confident that no matter how searching this may be, the prisoner will withstand it.
At the time you made the acquaintance of Mrs French, were you employed?
- No, sir.
- How much money did you have?
- A few pounds.
- Did she give you any?
No.
- Did you expect to receive any?
- No, sir.
Did you know that in her new will, you were the beneficiary of £80,000?
No, I didn't.
Now, Mr Vole, when you went to visit
Mrs French for the last time, did you wear a trench coat and a brown hat?
- Yes, I did.
- Was it this coat and hat?
Yes, sir.
My lord, the defence, in its efforts to establish an alibi for the prisoner, circulated this photograph, hoping to bring forth a witness who had seen him leaving
Mrs French's house or entering his own at the times that he has stated.
Apparently, this splendid effort was without results.
However, the defence will be pleased to learn that, at the last moment, a witness has come forward, and that the prisoner had been seen wearing this coat and this hat.
Lamentably, he had not been seen on the night of the murder but one week before.
On the afternoon of October 8, were you not in a travel agency in Regent Street?
And did you not make inquiries about prices and schedules of foreign cruises?
Supposing I did? It's not a crime, is it?
Not at all. Many people go on a cruise when they can afford to pay for it.
- But you couldn't pay for it, could you?
- Well, I was hard up. I told you that.
And yet you came to this particular travel agency with a clinging brunette?
A clinging brunette, Mr Myers?
My lord, the lady was so described to me.
She was very affectionate with the prisoner, constantly clinging to his arm.
Oh.
You then admit that you made inquiries about expensive and luxurious cruises?
How did you expect to pay for such a thing?
- I don't know. It was...
- If you don't know, perhaps I can help.
On the morning of the very same day, you heard Mrs French change her will,
- leaving you the bulk of her money.
- I didn't!
And in the afternoon, you started plans to dispose of it.
No! It was nothing of the kind.
I was in a pub and I met a girl.
I don't even remember her name.
We had a drink and walked out together.
We passed the window and saw the fancy posters, all blue seas and palm trees.
The Grecian isles or somewhere. We went in for fun and I started asking for folders.
Well, the man gave me a funny look because I did look a bit shabby.
Anyway, it irritated me, so I kept asking for the swankiest tours, all de luxe and cabin on the boat deck, but it was just an act!
An act? You knew that in a week you were going to inherit £80,000!
No! It wasn't that way at all.
It was make-believe and childish but... it was fun and I enjoyed it. I never thought of killing anyone or inheriting any money.
It's just a coincidence that Mrs French should be killed only one week later?
I told you! I didn't kill her!
Do you know any reason why Christine
Helm should give the evidence she has
- if it were not true?
- No. I don't know why my wife...
I don't know why I still call her my wife.
She must be lying or out of her mind.
She seemed remarkably sane and self-possessed.
- But insanity is all you can suggest?
- I don't understand it.
Oh, God! What's happened?
What's changed her?
Very effective, I'm sure.
But in this court we deal with fact.
And the fact, Mr Vole, is that we've only your word for it.
That you left Mrs French's house at the time you say, that you came home at 5 and 20 minutes past 9, and that you did not go out again!
Somebody must have seen me in the street or going in the house!
One would think so. But the only person who did see you come home that night says it was ten past ten and that you had blood on your hands.
- I cut my wrist!
- You cut your wrist deliberately!
No, I didn't! I didn't do anything.
But you make it sound as though I did.
I can hear it myself.
You came home at ten past ten!
No, I didn't! You've got to believe me.
You've got to believe me!
You killed Emily French!
No, I didn't! I didn't do it!
I didn't kill her! I never killed anybody!
God, it's like a nightmare.
Some ghastly, horrible dream.
Good evening, Sir Wilfrid.
How did it go today?
Oh, Sir Wilfrid.
I'm from Hawks and Hill, sir, and I've brought your Bermuda shorts for a fitting.
What?
- You'd better slip these on, Sir Wilfrid.
- I'm in the middle of a murder trial.
It'll all be over by the afternoon, and the boat train doesn't go until 9.40.
You work it out. You know my shape, you've stabbed it often enough.
Upstairs. You need a lukewarm bath and your calcium injection.
And there's a lot more packing to be done.
It's ridiculous having boat reservations.
The jury may be out for days.
Not on this case, I'm afraid.
It seems too open-and-shut.
I watched when Frau Helm was on the stand. They didn't like her.
No, but they believed her. They liked
Leonard Vole but they didn't believe him.
And that travel agency business doesn't help either. Cigar?
No.
- Wilfrid, do you think she lied?
- Well, don't you?
I'm not sure.
I am. She lied. Whether she calls it
Meineid or perjury, she lied.
The only question is why. What's her game? What is she up to? What?
I hope that in your final speech you won't become too emotionally involved.
- You must think of your condition.
- He's right.
I want to see you save yourself.
This isn't going to be your last case.
Yes, it is. But until it's over,
I'm still a barrister.
My client's life is at stake.
That's all that matters - his life.
He's entitled to the best that I can do.
If I can't stand up to make my final appeal for him, I'll make it sitting down.
If I become short of breath I'll take a pill, or two pills, or all of them and the box too.
- Yes?
- This Sir Wilfrid Robarts' place?
- Well, yes, it is.
- Let me talk to the old geezer.
- Who is this speaking, please?
- Never you mind. Let me talk to 'im.
I'm afraid that's impossible.
What is the nature of your business?
It's business all right.
I've got something to sell 'im, I 'ave.
Well, really, madam!
And what I want to sell 'im, believe me, 'e'll want to buy.
- It's got to do with that Leonard Vole.
- Leonard Vole?
It's about that German wife.
I've got the goods on her and it's for sale.
This is Wilfrid Robarts speaking.
Now, what is this all about?
Well, hello, ducky.
What is this you said about Mrs Leonard Vole?
I'm not just saying.
I've got it in black and white.
- You've got what?
- Listen to this carefully, ducks.
I'm at the buffet at Euston Station at the far end of the bar.
I'll be here for 30 minutes because that's when me train leaves.
If you want the lowdown on that German bag, get yourself here.
What lowdown?
What do you know about her?
Uh-uh. Not on the phone.
You'd better get on over here, and bring plenty of money.
Now, just a moment! Hello? Hello?
That's... bilge. Some drunken crank.
You get those in every murder trial.
Giving me an ultimatum, Euston Station in
30 minutes. Got the lowdown on Mrs Vole.
Balderdash.
I'm too old and too sick to go on a wild-goose chase.
- Come on, Mayhew.
- Where to, Sir Wilfrid?
Euston Station, where do you think?
Now, sir?
Shortly.
Cigar!
Sir Wilfrid, where are you going?
Your bath, your massage, your dinner, your injection!
Thank you, Miss Plimsoll.
- You wouldn't be Sir Wilfrid, would you?
- I would.
Didn't recognise you without your wig.
Lovely you all look in them wigs.
Two o' yer? I'm not talking to two o' yer.
This is Mr Mayhew,
Leonard Vole's solicitor.
- Well, that's all right, then.
- And your name, please?
No need for mine. If I did give you a name it mightn't be the right one, might it?
'Ave a drink, boys.
Two whiskies for me gen'lmen friends.
Now what is this information you allegedly have?
You realise that you're duty-bound to give any evidence that you might have?
- Come off it. Did you bring any money?
- What is it you have, madam?
Letters. Letters that German wife of 'is wrote. That's what I've got.
- Letters written to the prisoner?
- To the prisoner? Don't make me laugh.
Poor bleeder, he's been took in by 'er all right. And these letters prove it.
If we could see these letters, we could advise you as to how pertinent they are.
Well, I don't expect you...
Well, as I say, I don't expect you to buy without seeing, but fair's fair.
If these letters get the boy off, it's £100 for me, right?
If these letters contain information useful to the defence, I'm prepared to offer £10.
What? Ten bleeding pounds for letters like these?
Take that piece of glass out o' yer eye. Good night.
If these help prove my client's innocence,
£20 should, I think, not be an unreasonable sum for your expenses.
50 and it's a bargain.
That's if you're satisfied with 'em.
- All right, blast yer.
'Ere, take 'em. Nice little lot there.
How do we know these are from Mrs Vole?
Oh, she wrote 'em all right.
It's all fair an' square.
I 'ope they fix 'er good and proper.
I've had messages from Mrs Vole.
It looks like her handwriting.
Good heavens, look at this.
Juicy, ain't they?
- There's one that's even better.
- How did you get hold of these?
What's the difference so long as she gets what's coming?
- What have you got against her?
- Ha!
I'll give you something to dream about, mister.
Want to kiss me, ducky?
Ha!
- I didn't suppose you would.
- Christine Vole did that to you?
Not 'er, the chap I was going with. He was a bit younger than me but I loved 'im.
Then she come along, started seeing 'im on the sly. Then one day he cleared out.
I found 'em together. I said what I thought of 'er and he cut me face up proper.
- Did you go to the police about it?
- Who, me? Not likely.
It wasn't 'is fault. It was all 'ers, gettin' 'im away from me, turnin' 'im against me.
But I waited me time to pay 'er back.
And it's come now.
I'm deeply sorry, deeply sorry.
We'll make it another £5 for the letters.
'Olding out on me, were yer?
I knew I was being soft with yer.
Cold-blooded vindictiveness.
Read this one.
Unbelievable.
We'd better have the full name of the man to whom these were addressed, Miss...
Miss, um...
Where is she?
On that train, I should think. Doesn't want her other cheek slashed. Can't blame her.
- Care for another, sir?
- Hm?
Good idea.
Silence!
Be upstanding in court.
All persons who have anything to do before my lords, the queen's justices of oyer and terminer and general jail delivery for the jurisdiction of the Central Criminal Court, draw near and give your attendance.
God save the queen.
Since the defence has called but one witness, the prisoner, it has the right to be heard last.
Mr Myers, if you are ready, let us have the final address for the prosecution.
My lord, members of the jury,
I will be brief in my final speech because I think we've proved so obvious a case of murder against Leonard Vole, that a verdict of guilty must be the only possible conclusion.
I will briefly summarise these facts...
You'd better begin again, Mr Myers.
That is, if Sir Wilfrid is at all interested in our proceedings.
I am, indeed, my lord. The speech for the crown, however, is premature.
I ask that the case for the defence be reopened. And that a witness be recalled.
I most strenuously object to the case being reopened at this final stage.
Evidence of a startling nature has come into my possession.
The course my learned friend proposes is quite unprecedented.
I have anticipated this objection and can meet it with ample precedent.
There is the king vs Stillman, reported in the criminal appeal reports of 1926 at page 463.
Also, the king vs Porter in volume one of the king's bench division reports,
1942 at page 153.
And lastly there is the case of the king vs Sullivan in which this issue was raised, which
I'm sure Your Lordship will remember, since you appeared for the prosecution.
I did? Oh, yes, before Mr Justice Swindon.
What is this new evidence, Sir Wilfrid?
Letters, my lord.
Letters written by Christine Helm.
My lord, the prosecution continues its objection.
If my memory serves me well,
Your Lordship's similar objection in the king against Sullivan was sustained.
Your memory, for once, serves you ill, Mr Myers.
My objection then was overruled by Mr Justice Swindon.
As yours is now, by me.
Call Christine Helm.
Christine Helm.
- Christine Helm.
- Christine Helm.
If you still have doubts about Mr Vole, I wouldn't mind betting you a box of cigars.
Mrs Helm, you appreciate you are still under oath?
Yes.
- Do you know a man named Max?
- I don't know what you mean.
It's a simple question. Do you or do you not know a man called Max?
Max? Certainly not.
It's a fairly common name and yet you've never known a man named Max?
In Germany, perhaps, but a long time ago.
I shall not ask you to go back that far.
Just a few weeks, to... October 20 last.
- What have you got there?
- A letter.
I suggest that on October 20
- you wrote a letter...
- I don't know what you're talking about.
...addressed to a man named Max.
- I did nothing of the sort.
The letter was but one of a series written to the same man.
Lies! All lies!
You seem to have been, well, let us say, on intimate terms with this man.
How dare you say a thing like that?
It isn't true!
I'm not concerned with the general trend of this correspondence, only one letter.
"My beloved Max, an extraordinary thing has happened."
"I believe all our difficulties may be ended."
I will not stand here and listen to a pack of lies!
That letter's a forgery.
It isn't even my letter paper!
- It isn't?
- No!
I write my letters on small blue paper with my initials on it.
Like this?
This is a bill from my tailor for a pair of extremely becoming Bermuda shorts.
Wilfrid the fox! That's what we call him and that's what he is.
Now, Mrs Helm, you've been kind enough to identify your letter paper.
Now, if you like, I can have an expert identify your handwriting.
Damn you!
- Damn you!
- Leave her alone!
- Damn you!
- Mrs Helm!
Let me go!
Let me get out of here! Let me go!
- Mrs Helm!
- Let me go!
Usher, get the witness a chair.
Sir Wilfrid, will you now read the letter in question so that the jury may hear it?
"My beloved Max, an extraordinary thing has happened."
"All our difficulties may soon be solved."
"Leonard is suspected of murdering the old lady I told you about."
"His only hope of an alibi depends on me and me alone."
"Suppose I testify that he was not at home with me at the time of the murder, that he came home with blood on his sleeves, and that he even admitted to me that he'd killed her?"
"Strange that he always said he would never let me leave him."
"But now, if this succeeds, he will be leaving me because they will take him away forever and I shall be free and yours, my beloved."
"I count the hours until we are together. Christine."
Mrs Helm?
Will you go back to the witness box?
I now ask you again, Christine Helm, did you write this letter?
Christine, tell him you didn't write it.
I know you didn't.
Please answer my question.
Did you write this letter?
Before answering, Mrs Helm,
I wish to warn you that the law regarding perjury in this country is very severe.
If you have already committed perjury in this courtroom,
I strongly advise you not to add to your crime.
But, if this letter has not been written by you, then now is the time to state this fact.
I wrote the letter.
And that, my lord, is the case for the defence.
I keep asking which is harder, your head or your arteries?
Stop pressing your luck, you're overdue.
We're all packed and ready.
I hope the jury won't take all afternoon.
I concede.
- Congratulations, here are your cigars.
- Not yet.
Come on, it's all over, wrapped up neat and tidy.
- What's wrong?
- It's a little too neat, too tidy, and altogether too symmetrical, that's what's wrong with it.
- The jury is back.
- You're not worried about the verdict?
It's not their judgment that worries me, it's mine.
Come along.
Where's my wig?
The prisoner will stand up.
Members of the jury, are you all agreed upon your verdict?
We are.
Do you find the prisoner at the bar,
Leonard Stephen Vole, guilty or not guilty of the murder of Emily Jane French?
Not guilty, m'lord.
Silence!
Silence!
Leonard Stephen Vole, you have been found not guilty of the murder of Emily Jane French on October 14.
You are hereby discharged and are free to leave the court.
Persons with anything more to do before the queen's justices of oyer and terminer and jail delivery for the jurisdiction of the Central
Criminal Court may depart the area.
Thank you. Yes, we'll talk later.
Thank you, Mr Mayhew.
Thank you, Mr Brogan-Moore. Carter.
Thank you, Sir Wilfrid, for everything.
You were wonderful.
- I'd say we were lucky all around.
- Yeah.
I have your belongings. Sign the receipt,
Mr Vole, and we can release you.
"Mr Vole." They didn't call me Mr when they charged me.
- I'll go with you, I have your hat and coat.
- Let's go before they change their mind!
Chipper, isn't he? An hour ago, he had one foot on the gallows and the other on a banana peel.
You ought to be very proud, Wilfrid.
Aren't you?
Not yet. We've disposed of the gallows, but there's still that banana peel somewhere, under somebody's foot.
-  Every word you said was a lie!
- You ought to be locked up! Liar!
You'd better wait here until we get rid of that crowd, madam.
Thank you.
Ready, sir? Miss Plimsoll will be waiting.
Let me finish the last of the cocoa while I'm still beyond her jurisdiction.
Would you excuse me,
Brogan-Moore, Carter? Thank you.
I never thought you British could get so emotional. Especially in public.
- I apologise for my compatriots.
- It's all right.
I don't mind being called names or pushed around or even kicked in the shin.
But I have a ladder in my last pair of nylons.
In case you are not familiar with our prison regulations, no silk stockings.
Prison? Will I go to prison?
You heard the judge.
You will certainly be charged with perjury,
- tried for it, and to prison you shall go.
- Well, it won't be for life, will it?
If I were appearing for the prosecution, it would be.
You loathe me, don't you?
Like the people outside.
What a wicked woman I am, and how brilliantly you exposed me and saved Leonard's life.
The great Sir Wilfrid Robarts did it again.
Well, let me tell you something.
You didn't do it alone. You had help.
What are you driving at?
I'm not driving at anything.
Leonard is free and we did it.
- We?
- Remember?
When you said that no jury would believe an alibi given by a loving wife, no matter how much she swore he was innocent? That gave me the idea.
What idea?
The idea that I should be a witness, not for my husband, but for the prosecution.
That I should swear Leonard was guilty and that you should expose me as a liar because only then would they believe
Leonard was innocent.
So now you know the whole story, Sir Wilfrid.
I'll give yer something to dream about, mister.
Want to kiss me, ducky?
I suspected something, but not that.
- Never that!
- Thank you for the compliment.
It's been a long time since I acted and I never played such a vital role.
All those blue letters!
It took me hours to write them, to invent Max. There never was a Max.
There's never been anyone but Leonard.
My dear, could you not have trusted me, worked with me truthfully and honourably? We would have won.
I could not run that risk.
You thought he was innocent.
And you knew he was innocent.
I understand.
No, Sir Wilfrid, you do not understand at all.
I knew he was guilty.
That can't be true! No!
Listen to me, once and for all.
He came home after ten, he had blood on his sleeves, he said he had killed the woman, only I could save him. He pleaded.
And you saved him? A murderer?
Again, you don't understand.
I love him.
I told you she was an actress.
And a good one.
Leonard!
I knew she'd do something, but I just didn't know what or how.
Leonard, Leonard.
- Fooled you completely, didn't she?
- It was you, Vole, who fooled me.
Oh, easy. Easy. We both got out of this alive, let's stay this way.
- Where are your pills?
- You've made a mockery of English law.
Who did? You got me off and I can't be tried again for this.
- That's English law too, isn't it?
- You can't touch him now. Nobody can.
The scales of justice may tip one way or another, but ultimately they balance out.
You'll pay for this.
Ultimately's a long way off. I'd rather pay for it as soon as possible and in cash.
Suppose we double your fee? There'll be lots of money once the will goes through.
I'm not cheap, I want everybody to get something out of it.
There's Janet McKenzie.
We'll get her that new hearing aid.
And we'll get you a new one of these.
18-carat gold if they make them.
And when they try you for perjury there'll be £5,000 for the defence.
I don't care, just so we'll be together.
You don't know what I've been through.
Standing in the witness box, having to face you, saying I never loved you.
What is it, Leonard?
The luggage is in the car and we've only 20 minutes to catch the boat train.
This is a nice young lady
I met during the trial.
Len!
Oh, Len!
Len...
Oh, Len, they've been trying to keep me away. It's had me nearly crazy.
Leonard, who's this girl?
I'm not this girl, I'm his girl.
Tell her, Len.
Leonard, is this the girl who was with you in the travel bureau?
The girl you said you hardly knew, didn't even know her name?
That's right. That's who I am and I know all about you. You're not his wife.
Never have been. You're years older than he is. We've been together for months and we're going away on a cruise, just like they said in court. Tell her, Len.
- Yes, Len, tell me yourself.
- All right, Diana, come along.
You can't, not after what I've done.
I won't let you.
I saved your life getting you out of Germany, you got me out of this mess, so we're even. It's over now.
Don't, Leonard! Don't leave me!
Don't, Leonard! Don't!
Pull yourself together.
They'll have you up for perjury.
Don't make it worse or they'll try you as an accessory.
And you know what that means.
I don't care. Let them. Let them try me for perjury, or an accessory, or...
- Ready?
- Or better yet... let them try me for...!
Argh!
- Call a doctor.
- It's no use. No doctor can help now.
- What happened?
- She killed him.
Killed him?
She executed him.
Carter, what have you done with the luggage?
I sent it on ahead to the station, and I've got a cab waiting outside.
- A remarkable woman.
- You can just barely catch the boat train.
Better bring the luggage back, and you can dismiss the cab.
We are not going yet, are we?
Thank you, Miss Plimsoll.
Get Brogan-Moore to my chambers, and Mayhew too.
We're appearing for the defence in the trial of Christine Vole.
Sir Wilfrid?
You've forgotten your brandy.
The management of this theatre suggests
that for the greater entertainment of
friends who have not yet seen the picture,
you will not divulge to anyone
the secret of the ending
of "Witness For The Prosecution".
The KADR Film Unit presents
NIGHT TRAIN
Cast
Screenplay
Photography
Director
Look where you're going!
Excuse me.
The ladies are only seeing us off.
Excuse me. I've forgotten my sleeper reservation.
Thank you very much.
What are you waiting for?
Excuse me, I'm very tired.
I can't let you in without it.
I'll buy another if I have to.
I have to leave today.
What was the number of your berth?
First class. I can't remember the number.
Get on, maybe somebody will be late for the train.
That will certainly be me.
"Evening News", "Literary News", water!
"Express", please.
And one for me.
All aboard! it's your lucky day.
Here's my ticket.
Berth no. 15 or 16.
Which do you want?
The whole compartment is free?
I will give the other berth to another passenger.
I'd rather be alone.
The train is quite crowded.
I'll pay for both berths.
As you wish.
I'll issue the tickets later.
Don't bother. I won't need them.
Where should I wake you?
Before we reach Hel.
Excuse me.
My sincere apologies.
You must have gotten a wrong compartment.
Did I?
I was going to say exactly the same to you.
This is my bag and I have a ticket for this berth.
The upper one, actually, but that's rather immaterial.
I don't care. We'll see.
Excuse me.
That's interesting. is it?
Excuse me, I was just reading your paper.
Yesterday, it was a minor note and here's a whole column about it today.
Are you a journalist?
No, but I once hoped I could become one.
I read a lot though.
Here's the story I had in mind.
Further details of yesterday's murder.
Yesterday it seemed it was a burglar who did it.
But now they're certain the husband was the killer.
And why people get married? it's weird that he ran away though.
My experience shows that such murderers...
...either commit suicide or give themselves up to the police.
The strain, you see.
But this one ran away...
Your tickets, please.
How did you get on without showing it to me?
I don't quite follow...
How did you get past me?
You were busy, taking tickets from others, so I simply... it isn't simple at all.
This isn't yours. Can't you see this letter "M"?
So what? The number of the berth is correct.
But this compartment is for men only.
I didn't know that. Some man sold me the ticket.
Well, you can't travel here. Those are the regulations.
You'll have to get out of here. Passengers are waiting.
No, madam.
I paid for the berth and I am not leaving.
My pillow's missing.
For the last time, please, leave the compartment!
Should I wait until this lady makes up her mind?
I'll be with you now. in the meantime, please, pack your luggage.
What a nerve!
What happened there?
A young woman in a compartment for men only!
That gentleman's? Yours, by any chance?
Yes. But of course the conductor is a woman as well...
Congratulations.
Excuse me?
Birds of a feather.
You're either joking, or you know nothing about women.
I'm not complaining.
What'll happen now?
Nothing. She'll have to leave.
Where to?
You can always let her have your berth.
But one berths is empty so what's the problem?
Well, if there's an empty berth...
So you're asking for trouble.
As you wish, I'll fetch the inspector immediately.
Maybe we can avoid blowing this out of proportion.
Oh, you don't know me...
I've had enough.
Please, drop the whole matter. if you wish... if you're such a stickler for the rules. We can change.
Strictly speaking, the top berth is mine.
Thank you.
I'll bring the paper back right away.
No problem, I have read it already.
Just a moment.
Can I help you?
Thank you, I'm fine.
What a pity.
Excuse me.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Are you going far?
Quite far.
To the seaside?
Yes.
So am I.
Where are the sandwiches, honey? in the suitcase.
Which one?
The grey one.
I can't find them.
Excuse me.
Let's say a murderer confesses on his deathbed...
...so he's welcome in heaven?
You simplify everything.
But I don't! . Let's suppose I lay dying...
...and confess to you that I committed adultery.
While a criminal...
What criminal?
Let's say the one from today's paper -
...admits he killed his wife.
So we both meet in paradise?
No, you both meet at the Last Judgment.
Well...
The Lord judgeth human sins.
The shedding of blood is the severest of crimes. it's a crime against one of the commandments.
And as such it should requires the most severe penance. if looks could kill, I'd be dead already.
Nonsense.
What's up? it's forbidden.
Let me fetch the key.
Thank you. Please, hand this to that young lady...
Which one?
...in the sweater with the low neckline on the back.
Oh, I know her.
Can't I come in?
No, you can't.
"if you don't come out at once...
...I'll derail the train. I love you."
That's for you.
Excuse me.
May I help you?
No, I'll be fine.
Maybe after all?
No, thank you.
Handkerchief, please.
Head up.
Tears will wash out the rest.
Are you crying?
Not any longer.
Please, forgive me. I was quite rude earlier.
But I wanted to be on my own.
So did I.
We both failed.
We did.
Shall we light a pipe of peace?
I forgot my cigarettes as well.
Here you are.
4 and 8 make 12, plus 5 it makes 17.
Odd again. it's bad.
Fortune-telling?
More of an addiction.
Everyone catches it sooner or later.
After the first failure. if the number is even things may change for the better.
And then it becomes a reflex action.
Excuse me.
Let's drop it.
We're going on holidays and that's all that matters. isn't it?
I'm not going on holidays.
A new job?
You can say so.
On the coast?
Yes.
You're not a fisher, are you?
No, I don't think so.
Now we're chatting like typical passengers on a train.
I could be a meteorologist, for example.
You disapprove of this line of work?
Not really. But it's hardly a serious profession.
Why?
Because you can't really forecast anything.
Uncover your legs!
I'm losing my mind.
Have you ever visited a morgue?
Never.
What was I talking about?
You are quite shaken.
Actually, you should be afraid of me.
Are you?
I don't think so.
I will buy you biscuits.
Leave it. You won't make it back.
But you asked for biscuits.
Have you made up your mind?
Have you?
Do you want to start the argument again?
No, I want to conclude it.
Please, don't go.
Get off the train with me.
I said no, once and for all.
Why not? Why?
What was in that letter?
Let's not talk about it, please.
You didn't intend to go anywhere.
Why did you tell me you were alone?
Who sent you that letter?
Why are you this way?
I've already told you why.
Could you lend me a few zlote?
They have no change here.
Here is your chocolate.
Here you are.
Thank you.
Can I have this packet of biscuits?
Hurry up, please, the train is about to leave.
You want some apples?
How much?
I'll pay you back right away when we get back to carriage.
Would you like some too?
No, thank you.
Nice old woman.
Your companion is flirting.
The boy is not that bad-looking.
Long legs, slightly bent. Should be a good dancer.
But it's not my type. Do you like dancing?
I don't know.
I'll be coming at every station. Until you agree.
Listen, don't follow me. Let me be.
After all that we shared?
We shared nothing.
Nothing?!? Do you mean it?
The two weeks spent together meant nothing?
We were so happy together!
Let go.
Why did you come to the bloody lakes!
Let go. People are looking.
Damn it!
You're hurting me.
Couldn't you make up your mind earlier?
At the last moment. Do you want to pay a fine?
Leave me alone! I'm not a child.
I've seen many big men like you with their legs cut off.
Will this place be free?
Yes, well, I don't know.
What happened?
I dropped my bracelet.
Here it is. You bent it.
I hit my wrist while closing the window.
Show me your hand.
I'm fine. it must hurt.
You loved so much.
Whom?
The man for whom you cut your wrists.
You have a romantic imagination.
She was 18, he was much older.
He wouldn't or couldn't leave his wife and family.
And she wouldn't understand that.
Why are you telling me that? it's just a banal story.
What do you want from me?
You are still in love with him.
No, I am not! I don't love anybody! I don't want to.
Excuse me. I just wanted to return your money. it's nothing.
Thank you once more.
I think that funny apple-woman took us for a couple.
We must look as if we were married. Funny, isn't it?
Come to me.
Go back to your compartment.
Don't overdo it. You know I'm unpredictable. if you don't come here, I'll jump.
No!
Why are you doing this? Why can't we be together? if you want it I'll go with you all the way.
Nothing keeps me here.
Leave me!
How could you do it!
I won't repeat that. Come here.
You're a slut.
A whore!
That was the best holiday I ever had.
You will excuse me.
We're chatting just to kill the time.
As people do on a train.
Turn around, please.
You'll get soot in your eyes again.
I don't know what I am to do.
I'm meeting him tomorrow.
I want him to pay for all the pain I suffered.
I don't even know your name.
May I?
I'm terribly sorry, but you forgot your money.
Thank you.
Someone might have taken it.
I'm sorry I disturbed you.
That's great. How moving.
Now they'll be imagining a romantic adventure.
A sleeper... Night...
The train thundering into the unknown...
A man and a woman...
A romantic adventure.
You see, that's just my bad luck.
Aren't you coming to bed?
Give me a minute. I'm not sleepy yet.
You always fuss.
You know I can't sleep if you're not in bed.
We're not at home now.
How long will it take? 5, 10 minutes?
All right. But close the door, please.
Tickets please.
What about you? Your ticket, please.
I don't have a ticket.
So you jump on a moving train without a ticket?
What's your destination?
I don't know.
I have no time for jokes. Where to?
I don't know.
What you mean, you don't know?
I mean exactly that.
Can you deal with it outside?
People are trying to sleep.
Come with me.
So where do I make the ticket out for?
Wherever you like. I don't care.
There's no such station.
But I really don't care.
Give it a thought, then.
I'll be right back.
Won't you find a free seat?
Today? it's the holidays!
Good evening.
Can I get a beer?
Just a second.
You can lie down now. Your bed is ready.
Good night.
I've settled them all down at last.
Got a 100 from him? You're doing well. it is very crowded at your end?
You've had your hair done...
Sit down. You're on your feet all night long. it's the varicose veins that bother me the most.
I should get holidays but I can't before the autumn.
That's the kind who always get holidays at the right season.
You look really pretty today.
Are you admiring the view? it's a beautiful night.
A starry sky.
No rings around the moon. That guarantees fine weather. is it really so? That's most auspicious.
What bright sparks.
Pure poetry.
They're like glow-worms.
Nicely put.
One shouldn't sit down to a good meal alone, spend a wakeful night or travel without company.
Or be one's own sole counsellor.
Even the humblest travelling companion brings blessing.
A small crab once saved his companion, a Brahmin, from a viper.
That's nice. What made you think of it?
You forced me to think about you.
And I remembered an old indian tale.
How strange... with my bad memory.
I forget everything very quickly.
That's good. You'll forget about this all too.
So you're a meteorologist. What actually do you do?
I foretell the future.
A witch then. Good or bad?
You can try me.
I'd be afraid. You would know too much about me.
You see. That's why there's no point in fortune-telling.
Why don't you finish your indian tale...
...of the little crab that saved the Brahmin.
The end of the corridor, on the right.
On the right...
Aren't you going to lie down yet?
I can't, father.
Those berths one above the other are just like bunks.
And I spent four years in Buchenwald.
No, thank you.
The reverend father is an old man.
He's 83.
He himself said this would be his last...
...pilgrimage to Our Lady at Czestochowa.
Your Honour, the prosecution called my client a murderer.
As a man and a lawyer
I cannot accept this definition of his crime.
Article 225 par. 1 talks of a premeditated act...
...planned long in advance and having in view...
...material gains.
Would you say that my client's actions...
...qualify under this heading?
No, a thousand times no!
The evidence so far has shown...
...that the accused acted under great strain...
...and he was clearly under extreme provocation.
This, as you know, is covered by par.2, article 225.
I maintain that the charge can at most be manslaughter...
...and certainly not murder.
Now let us examine the actual crime.
Jurors, let us examine it like fellow human beings...
...who recognize provocation, sympathise with emotion...
Yes... if I handled the case right they would start crying at this point.
Emotions are in fashion today.
Everyone's mad about them somehow.
I often read about such trials in the newspapers.
That would be perfect for me. instead I have to stick to mortgage registers.
A trial like that... Do you understand?
I don't.
One can't even talk to you. Put out the light.
Crying again, I guess.
Are you asleep?
Should I switch the light off?
No.
You want to talk?
That's good.
You smoke a lot.
I do. For a few hours.
Would you like a cigarette?
Not now, thank you.
You'll relax by the seaside.
I wish.
You don't know how to smile.
I wouldn't be so sure. Do you enjoy laughing?
Very much.
So do I, but I can't quite manage it. it's not true that you still love him.
I just don't know.
Where are you hiding now?
Me?
You were far away for a while.
You really are a clairvoyant.
We've never stopped here before.
They're heading towards us.
Get up quickly. There's an inspection.
This is the sleeping-car?
Good.
What happened?
Let me look at your plan.
The plan? Here you are.
Who is it? it's the conductor. Please open the door.
Step back. You occupy berth no. 16?
That's right. What is it?
Hands, please. is that your case?
Can you tell me what's going on?
Quiet, people are asleep.
You should know it best. Your iD!
I've forgotten about it too.
Please, come outside.
Get dressed!
But why?
Hurry up and don't argue.
You know who you shared the compartment with?
He's a murderer.
He murdered his wife. You ask them.
You were lucky. You can't tell with a man like that.
What happened?
What are you doing here? Go back to bed.
I suffer from insomnia.
Insomnia is not an excuse. Please disperse.
Gentlemen!
What happened?
They caught that murderer.
That guy in shades. He was in there with the girl.
Come with us, please.
Have they taken him away?
They've arrested the murderer. it was the one in shades.
Did he resist?
No, he went quietly.
One would think you'd be safe here.
One is never safe.
How did they catch him?
How did they find him?
They must have been on his trail.
Who'd have thought...
You think so, father? So why the shades?
And the argument about the compartment?
He wanted to be alone.
He was weird. Didn't look you in the eye.
And what happened to the girl?
She went back to the compartment.
Perhaps she fainted?
Not these days.
But it was a shock. We should make sure.
I don't know what it's all about. it's a misunderstanding.
I left my papers in a hurry in the hospital.
You may be innocent, but we have our orders.
Who's the lady travelling with you?
I don't know.
Did the corporal check?
Did you check the lady's papers?
Which one?
The one travelling with the prisoner.
I received no such orders.
What do you want?
Have you been standing here long?
Police got on at the last station.
Did you come to tell me that?
Do you have a cigarette?
You need one badly?
Excuse me, you asked about berth no. 16, didn't you?
Where have you been?
I had ticket for no. 16.
This gentleman let me have the lower berth.
I bought that ticket from a man...
...who's travelling in the next car.
What man?
The one who sold me the ticket for berth no. 16.
I had this berth. Ask the conductor.
That's right. This lady had no. 16.
I only just realized when I saw him...
And why did you leave the sleeping-car in the first place?
Does it matter? The man you want is in the next car.
Go and check.
Let's go.
He's in there.
Where's the man who was sitting in the corner?
He left the compartment.
Where did he go?
How should I know?
What's the matter?
Fetch the sergeant.
You know what he looks like. Come along with me.
You never know...
He's gone.
Didn't I say so?
You stay here.
You go first.
Where are you going?
To see.
Excuse me.
Can't you make less noise?
We're full, can't you see?
Why do you turn on the light?
We are on a pilgrimage. Switch off the light.
Don't touch it. it's a sculpture.
What is going on?
They're searching for a murderer. He's on the train.
Let me pass.
Andrzej, don't go.
Leave me alone.
Be careful. He might have a gun.
Did a man run this way?
He did, a moment ago.
What are you doing! You'll get killed!
Help!
Someone's lying here, in the corridor.
Hania! What happened?
Maybe she needs water? Water, please.
What's going on?
Someone hit her.
He's running away. Stop him!
What are you doing!
Madam! Madam!
You won't get me! No!
So you want to murder us, do you?
Get up!
He has fainted.
Sir, take me closer. is it far from here to Alisinice?
About 2 kilometres.
I must have a look.
He's covered in blood.
Are they taking him away?
You see? He's handcuffed.
Let's go.
Not yet.
Take him away!
Get up.
What should I do now?
You can leave. We'll deal with him ourselves.
Please get back on the train. We're already late. it was the first time I've seen a real murderer.
Who caught him? You did?
You were the first after him.
How muddy you are. And I lost a shoe.
I guess they'll hang him.
So you ran after him too? Who caught him first?
Only one guy beat me to it. By a split second.
Let's go.
Have they taken him away already?
I didn't even see you leave the train.
I had to stay here and guard the carriage.
Can't you see her?
She can't sit still.
She goes to all the boxing matches.
Where are you going?
I must have a word with a friend. impossible. The compartments aren't locked.
I am responsible. it won't be a minute.
You can call her through the window.
I saw the murderer, you know.
Just look at yourself!
I'm fine. What an experience!
What a sight you are. You're getting quite unbearable.
Where's your shoe?
I lost it.
A new pair and you've already lost one.
Here goes the other. All he cares about are shoes.
Just like children.
Excuse me, I think I found the other shoe.
Thank you.
Wait for me.
You might have been left behind.
I lost count. You left so fast.
All aboard!
Get in! You seem quite determined to end up in hospital.
You can't act normally. What a man.
Look there, on the hill.
They're taking him away. it's a pity you didn't catch him. it would be an appropriate ending.
A kind of symbolic rehabilitation.
The innocent suspect catches the real criminal.
After all, for a time you were the murderer.
Don't go yet. You're the hero of tonight's events.
You won't get me!
Today a patient of mine died on the operating table.
Eighteen years old girl.
She jumped from some top floor window.
I did all I could, but it was hopeless.
I finished operating fifteen minutes before the departure.
I'm human, not a machine, after all.
I had three operations today. That was the last.
Unsuccessful...
Tomorrow at five? if you insist...
We'll be on holidays, after all.
Maybe you're right. Good night.
Good night!
I can't sleep anyway. Not after all this.
Some will stay up tonight, others tomorrow.
Have got a compress by any chance?
I only have peroxide. it should do. it won't show on your wedding-day.
Not mine for sure.
I'm quite sure to remain a bachelor.
You think so? it's better that way.
Thank you.
Let me have it back in the morning.
Thank you.
Good night.
Good morning. Did you have a good night?
Time to start waking up.
We're almost there.
Excuse me.
What's going on?
The sun's shining.
That's impossible. Would you believe it? I fell asleep.
When I received his letter.
I took the first train without thinking.
I don't know why I undertook the journey.
I thought of revenge, of killing him.
He's not much older than me.
He has no wife or children.
We could have been happy.
But things turned differently.
He's madly ambitious.
He was always searching for something.
Afraid of anonymity.
He called it the disease of our times.
He used my feelings only as a mirror.
Searching there for an image of himself, confirmation of his self-esteem.
Perhaps he was right.
Nobody wants to love. Everybody wants to be loved.
Will he be at the station?
I don't know. I guess he will, but it no longer matters.
I'm quite alone now, but really happy.
Very happy.
Is that the station?
My wife is waiting for me on the platform.
Goodbye.
You remember? You won't forget?
Honey!
Why does it take so long?
Thank you.
Does it still hurt?
Does any of you happen to have yesterday's paper?
Thanks. I slept through the night...
Madam.
I've lost my bracelet.
Let me help you.
Your pyjamas.
What a night! Not one you would quickly forget.
You want to get out on the beach side?
I'll open the door.
Happy holidays!
Open the door!
All the other passengers have already gotten out.
Janusz! We overslept. Get dressed.

You clatter like a horse.
You'll not steal up on any Jack the Ripper... thunderin' through the streets like that.
Three thousand men called out... all wearin' rubber slips on their boots- except the Yorkshiremen.
And one Yorkshireman's worth the lot of you.
Never mind me boots.
They'd be better off giving us guns... not yawpin' about rubber soles.
And what do we do with this... against a cunning devil with a long, sharp knife?
- An Irishman knows what to do with that.
- You go now, Katy.
Now go home, and don't come back here
tlll you learn how to behave yourself.
- I won't go home.
- I've warned you, Katy,
100 times if I've said it once.
Let go of me.
I'll go when I'm ready and not before.
- Let go of me!
- Now, come now.
- Is that any way to be acting?
- Now, just gentle like.
Easy and gentle, if you please.
Three strong men, it takes-
Three men to keep one poor woman from having a little drink.
Now, you'll be feelin' fine after a little sleep. Come on.
I'm feeling fine now, you great ape.
You've got a quick eye, miss.
He is a bit like an ape.
- Here, you for home. You've had enough.
- Now look here.
I will drink till I float if I want to...
- and no one is going to stop me.
- I might-
Here, let me handle this.
You see, miss, it's our duty to protect you from Jack the Ripper.
I don't think you mind a bit of protection... from a fiend like that, do ya?
You know...
I will be honored... to have a stalwart and polite constable such as you... take me home.
I live... just around the corner.
Just around the corner.
You know, it's a rare thing... to find a constable with such lovely manners.
Yorkshire gallantry, ma'am.
Well, here it is.
And-And-And thank you kindly.
It's our pleasure, ma'am.
Sleep well.
Thank you. Good night.
Good night.
Bah. Rot. Rot!
This fellow George Bernard Shaw should be shipped back to Ireland posthaste.
- What did you say, dear?
- I was talking to the dog.
About what, dear?
I said George Bernard Shaw should be sent back to Ireland.
Why? What did he say that you don't like?
He said if a duchess went down to Whitechapel... and got slaughtered by Jack the Ripper... something would be done to protect the lives of the poor women who live there.
- Well, it's true, isn't it?
- In the first place, it's not true.
The second, I was talking to my dog.
Very well, but I think at least you should tell him both sides.
That's ridiculous.
Now who could that be, this time of night?
I'm sure if you think carefully, you will discover a way of finding out.
William.
I feel something.
- Helen.
- Well, I do.
Good evening.
Do you have rooms to let?
I saw your advertisement... and the estate agents gave me this order to view.
You must forgive me for coming so late.
I was working.
Oh, yes, of course.
We do have rooms.
Please come in.
- I'm Mrs. Harley.
- My name is Slade.
- Well, Helen, who Is It?
- My husband, Mr. Harley.
This is Mr. Slade, dear.
He's come to see the rooms.
Yes. How do you do?
That's odd, you know.
He never does that with strangers.
May I see the rooms, Mrs. Harley?
Oh, yes, of course, Mr. Slade.
If you'll just come upstairs-
Here we are.
I'm awfully glad
I dusted In here today.
I had a feeling someone might come.
I'm sure you'd be very comfortable here.
Uh, this is the bedroom.
These are the only rooms you have, Mrs. Harley?
I could let you have them quite reasonably.
There Isn't anything else,
except the attic, of course.
The attic?
Please let me see it.
It's really very small, you know.
I would like very much to see it.
Do you like those?
They're old-time actresses.
Quaint, aren't they?
As you see, it isn't very nice.
Excellent. This is excellent.
Exactly what I need, madam.
You see, I am a pathologist.
I need a place to study and do a little experimental work... where I won't be interrupted.
I'd take the other rooms as well, of course.
I would live downstairs and work up here.
- Would that be all right with you?
- Yes, of course.
This will be most useful.
I suppose a scientist's experiments always seem mysterious to other people.
I assure you,
I won't be doing anything dangerous.
That's good.
May I take the rooms tonight?
Yes. Uh, but the terms-
Would five pounds a month be acceptable?
- Aye, well, now, that's more than adequate.
- Done.
You're our first
paylng guest, Mr. Slade.
You see, we've come upon a period of hard times.
So you must now let rooms?
Yes. Mr. Harley suffered business reverses... and with nothing to do, he's become so nervous and restless.
If at times he seems a little eccentric or rude...
- you will understand, won't you?
- Of course I will.
I believe I should pay you now, Mrs. Harley.
My habits are irregular,
I'm afraid.
I often need to be out late at night.
But I will be very quiet.
If you'll just regard me as a lodger, not as a guest... you'll-you'll hardly know
I'm in the house.
- A month in advance.
- Oh, you are thoughtful, Mr. Slade.
I'm so pleased it was you who came.
Are you?
Well, that's very kind.
The maid will get your meals whenever you want them.
- You have a maid?
- Yes.
This happens to be her night out.
But I can get you some dinner, if you'd like.
Yes.
This is a beautiful old Bible.
Yes. It belonged to my grandmother.
I hope you'll not take it away.
I should like to have it here.
It comforts me.
The Rlpper agaln! Murder In Whitechapel.
- Murder. Another Rlpper murder.
- Another one.
- Another murder.
- Another one of those horrible
Jack the Ripper murders.
Why can't the police stop them?
"Jack the Ripper."
What a revolting, stupid name.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Harley. The-
The whole thing is repugnant to me.
If you'll excuse me,
I'll get your dinner now.
Murder. Evening Standard. Echo.
The Ripper again.
Murder In Whitechapel.
Murder. Another Rlpper murder.
Another murder.
Evening Standard.
Echo.
- Oh, it's you.
- Oh, you heard?
- Yes. Another murder.
- The fourth. All the same.
He cuts their throats and then uses his knife like a doctor who's gone mad.
The papers daren't print all the details. Too gruesome.
- Want to read it?
- Uh, no, thank you.
William,
Mr. Slade took the room.
- Mm-hmm.
- And the attic too.
- He's taklng them as of now.
- I say, that's a bit quick, isn't it?
He won't be any trouble to us at all.
Don't like renting out bits and pieces of my own home.
Can't have any privacy.
Besides, we need the money.
I suppose you want me to go up and make a show of hospitality.
No. Tomorrow will do, dear, but if you're finished with the paper... let me take it up to Mr. Slade with his dinner.
Finished with it?
I just got it.
There, you see?
It's beginning-
- Well, now. Where's that dog?
- I think I saw him go upstairs.
Look, that fellow is not going to have my dog too, is he?
These pictures-
Their eyes follow you wherever you move.
They watch.
They get on my nerves.
I don't Ilke belng watched.
I understand.
I'll have them taken down tomorrow.
Further, they are pictures of actresses.
Yes. I hope you don't really object to actresses.
My niece Lily is on the stage.
- Your niece?
- Yes, we're very proud of her.
She opens next week at the Piccadilly Theatre Royal.
She's bringing over some special dances from Paris.
They're qulte shocklng,
but they're most dellghtful.
And she is very beautiful too,
I suppose.
Oh, yes.
Walt tlll you meet her.
Meet her?
Yes. She'll live here in this house.
Oh, you'll soon change your mind about actresses, Mr. Slade.
Come on, Prince.
Helen, it's 7:00.
Be qulet, dear. Read your paper.
We're just coming.
Oh, I'm as good as my word, Daisy.
I've got your pass for Miss Lily's performance tonight.
Oh, Mr. Harley, sir, you're awfully nice.
What's the matter?
Don't you want to go now?
Oh, I do, sir. I do.
- But I'm afraid.
- Afraid?
Well, there ain't a girl in all London who fancies walking home alone at night... what with the Ripper up to his devilish tricks.
Well, I suppose
I don't blame you.
Tell you what.
See the show and come home in a cab.
Oh, bless you,
Mr. Harley, sir.
- Now run along and fetch us a carriage, will you?
- Yes, Mr. Harley, sir.
Come along, Llly darllng, or you'll be late.
I'm coming, Auntie.
 Uncle Wllllam, you look
very handsome and elegant.
You look very ravishing yourself.
Oh, I'm so excited I'm afrald I'm golng to burst.
You must contain yourself at all costs.
Especially in the theater, where people are helplessly packed together.
Oh, do be quiet.
Be sure you've got everything.
Hello there, Mr. Slade.
Are you coming to the theater, Mr. Slade?
- I'm afraid not.
- Llly, I don't belleve
you've met Mr. Slade, have you?
My nlece, Llly Bonner.
Good evening, Mr. Slade.
I'm sorry you can't come to the opening.
- I have work I must do.
- You work at night?
Yes, quite often.
Sometimes all night.
- It's quieter at night.
- I like the night too.
It's the only time
I feel really alive.
It's at night that the interesting things happen.
What kind of work do you do at night, Mr. Slade?
I doubt if you'd be interested.
Do you just work?
Sometimes I walk close by the river.
The river is like liquid night flowing peacefully out to infinity.
I must not delay you.
I wish you success tonight.
Thank you.
Good night.
Good nlght.
He's so odd, isn't he?
I believe he's shy and lonely and all wrapped up in his Chinese puzzles.
- What Chinese puzzles?
- Oh, science and pathology or whatever you said he did.
I can't help feeling there's something odd about him.
He skulks, he prowls.
That's the something about him.
And if he's lonely, he has only to pop out of his shell and speak to someone.
I think he's interesting.
Evening Standard. Echo.
Evening standard. Echo.
Four thousand police on duty in Whitechapel.
Evening Standard. Echo.
Four thousand pollce

Oh, thank you, governor.
Evening Standard. Echo.
Dressing Room 1.
Hello, Annie.
Flowers for Miss Bonner.
Please.
May I see Miss Bonner?
- Miss Bonner is dressing.
- Who Is It, Lelah?
It's Annie Rowley-
"La Belle Anne," remember?
It's all rlght, Lelah.
I know who Annle Rowley Is. Come In.
Oh! It looks very nice.
Thank you for letting me come in.
I always like to come and say hello to my old dressing room.
It's perfectly all right, Annie. Help yourself to champagne, courtesy of the management.
- I've got to hurry.
- Yes, I remember.
- Did you know royalty was coming tonight?
- Yes, the prince of Wales.
Oh, I had it all once- royalty, champagne, flowers.
I remember my opening night and how excited I was.
I looked in this very mirror.
I wish I knew then what I know now.
I came up overnight.
Overnight I was forgotten.
Won't be that way with you.
Who knows?
No, it won't.
I went on looks alone.
You have talent and... all the rest.
Thanks, Annie.
You coming tonight?
- No, I have what I call my work.
- ? 
- I still sing and dance, you know.
- Oh? Where?
- I still sing and dance, you know.
- Oh? Where?
La Belle Anne now performs... at Madame Tussy's School of the Dance.
Gentlemen come in the evening to learn the latest fandango.
That's in the parlor in the front of the house.
Is there anything
I can do, Annie?
Too late.
You know, Annie, perhaps it isn't all up with you.
Perhaps I could help you.
I don't think there's a place with my girls... but I'm sure
I could do something.
She's gone, Miss Lily.
Yes.
Did you see that?
The little minx flirted with the prince of Wales.
Commissioner, there's been another murder by the Ripper.
Are you sure it was the Ripper again?
The report said it was a murder just like the others, sir.
Where was it? Whitechapel?
- Yes, sir.
- All right.
To Lily Bonner and her beautiful, talented troupe.
- Long life.
- Long life.
London is yours, Lily, and if I were lord mayor...
I'd give you the keys to the city.
Miss Bonner.
You know, champagne
has a speclal slgnlficance for me.
As I was growlng up
In the old Llmehouse District...
Champagne was only a remote word.
She is very beautiful, if I may say so, sir.
Mm-hmm. Wait here, Bates.
Dislike very much interrupting your party,
Miss Bonner.
It's a matter of utmost importance to Scotland Yard.
Sounds fascinating,
Inspector... Warwick.
And how can I help
Scotland Yard?
I want to ask you about a woman who came to see you before your performance this evening-
- a certain Annie Rowley.
- Yes, she was here.
I felt terribly sorry for her.
How much do you know about her?
Not much, I'm afraid.
Why, Inspector?
She has become another victim of Jack the Ripper.
Can you tell me if she was with anyone?
No. She was alone.
Someone said a man was seen near the place where Annie Rowley was found- a man carrying a small black bag and wearing an ulster.
Of course, that description fits thousands of people... but you saw no such man?
No.
No, I saw no one like that.
Finally got Lily settled for the night. Poor thing.
She thought she was so excited she couldn't sleep... but she dropped off while I was talking to her.
That's possible.
I just opened it.
I'm thinking.
- Thinking.
- You know, that man from Scotland Yard... said the Ripper was carrying a little black bag.
All he said was, there was a report... that a man carrying a black bag was seen in the vicinity of the murder.
And Mr. Slade came to us the night of the other murder... and all he had with him was a little black bag.
And tonight he took his black bag with him when he went out.
- He did not.
- Yes, he did.
His bag is not black, and he didn't take it with him tonight.
- William, he did.
- Would you stake your oath on that?
Your solemn oath in a court of law?
So you're not sure of the color of his bag... nor that he had it with him when he went out.
You're always leaping to illogical conclusions... which you call thinking.
And the window.
Oh, I'm sorry, dear.
I forgot.
Women can sense things, William.
Now you know that's true.
Remember when I said something had happened to my sister Sophie... and we found out that she'd fallen and broken her hip?
And remember-
What are you looklng at?
It's Mr. Slade.
- He's just coming In.
- Why not? He lives here.
He creeps.
You can hardly hear him move.
Naturally he creeps.
It's 3:00 in the morning.
Do you think he should come in dancing and singing and waking up the whole house?
He stopped at Lily's door.
He did?
- The window.
- Oh.
- More tea, dear?
- Hmm.
Paper says that the murderer used his knife in ways quite unprintable.
Ridiculous.
How can a knife be used unprintably?
- Tea, dear?
- Hmm.
Queen Victoria's issued a statement.
"She has told Commissioner Warren that no married man...
"could possibly be to blame for these murders...
"and therefore every bachelor in London... should be rounded up immediately."
- Tea?
- What a wise queen.
Now all Scotland Yard has to do is round up a million men... and ask them if they are Jack the Ripper.
Well, she's right.
No married man would do such a thing.
Oh, she's so gay, even in the morning.
Good morning.
Isn't it a beautiful world?
- All the reviews are raves.
- Why, of course.
Don't say it.
- Don't say what, dear?
- "I wonder who that can be."
Oh. I'll go, Daisy.
Hello. I'm Paul Warwick of Scotland Yard again.
Oh. Oh, yes.
Do come in.
- Good morning, Mr. Warwick.
- Hello, Miss Bonner.
I'm sorry to bother you so early in the morning... but it was important that I talk to you again.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- Do come in and have a cup of tea.
- Thank you.
- I'll get It, dear.
- Did you know I found out last night after you left... that Annie Rowley sent me some flowers?
Oh, yes. As a matter of fact, that was my excuse-
I mean reason- for calling.
The stage doorman told me.
I'd like to find out what florist the flowers came from.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't keep the box.
Well, it was a possible lead.
Though it did no help to Scotland Yard...
- it did give me the opportunity-
- Good morning.
I beg your pardon. I didn't mean to Interrupt.
Mr. Slade, this Is Mr. Warwlck.
How do you do?
Mr. Warwick's from Scotland Yard.
He's engaged on the Ripper case.
Now tell me, Inspector.
Is it really true that this time the Ripper was seen?
Yes. I was about to ask that too.
- He may have been.
- I don't think you'll ever catch him.
- Why not?
- Well, five murders-
This time Whitechapel was swarming with police... and yet you didn't even come near to finding him.
You don't know any more now than you did in the beginning.
- Yes, we do.
- Oh? What?
He's of average height, he's very quick and strong and he's left-handed.
Perhaps he carries a black bag, which would contain his knives.
- What I want to know is, why does he do it?
- There are many theories.
The favorite one Is that he's a manlac
who kllls at random.
- Do you belleve that?
- No.
 Hmm. Well, he may not klll
at random, but he's not sane.
You're a medical man, Mr. Slade.
Would you say he was sane?
I tend to agree with Miss Lily.
The police will not find him.
- Why not?
- The police are searching for a criminal.
In reality, there are no criminals.
There are only people doing what they must do because the are who they are.
So perhaps the police are searching for someone who doesn't exist.
Well, If my theorles are correct...
I shall make Jack the Ripper's own hands tie the noose that will hang him.
I still don't see how you worked it out that he was left-handed.
- Uh, do you, Mr. Slade?
- I've intruded too long.
I really only came down for the morning paper.
Thank you.
Have you all finished with it?
Oh, yes. Sorry.
Should have sent one up to you.
Thank you.
Excuse me.
Odd how that dog acts.
Seems to have fallen
In love wlth him.
Mr. Slade?
Mr. Slade.
Is something burning?
Don't come up here.
I'm sorry there's an odor, Mrs. Harley.
There was something
I had to burn. My work.
I'll open a wlndow.
Just leave the tray in my sitting room, please.
Oh-
Oh, I was thinking
I would have to clean the room today.
Whenever you wish, Mrs. Harley.
You'd be a darling if you could have that dress mended by tonight.
I'll try, Miss Lily.
You were so good in the show, you know.
I don't think it half matters what you wear on the stage.
It does, Daisy, and so does what I don't wear.
- I shall be at the hairdresser's most of the time.
- Yes, Miss Lily.
Good afternoon.
You're going out early.
Yes. I have just completed an experiment.
I- I must test it.
And when you've tested it and proved it... what will you know, Mr. Slade?
A little more about life and death.
I wonder what else you need to know about life... except that it's wonderfully worth living.
And of death, what is there to find out... except it is the end of life?
That is a philosophy for a young and beautiful woman who is the toast of London.
Thank you.
Which way are you going?
Your way, Miss Bonner.
Isn't that what your enraptured young men would say?
I think they might.
What do you say, Mr. Slade?
- I am going to work.
- Oh? Where's that?
Everyone is so curious about me.
Very well.
I am going to the university hospital... where there are laboratory facilities that I use.
I may not come home until late... and then your charming aunt will become suspicious.
And soon, because I am not like everyone else, she will ask me to leave.
I've had it all before.
Poor Mr. Slade.
Walk with me to the cab across the square.
She won't ask you to leave, Mr. Slade.
If she did, we'd all object.
- Would you?
- Of course.
I'm afraid you've been alone too much.
That makes one quite broody, you know?
- I am broody?
- A little. And when you're like that, you miss things.
There's so much delight in the world.
The whole sky, with the sure sun in it.
The sound of laughter, and of music.
The sweet enjoyment of a man's kiss.
Do I shock you, Mr. Slade?
You are an astonishing woman,
Miss Bonner.
Oh, dear.
I don't know what to do.
Ooh. Where is William?
Why doesn't he come home?
But what is it, Mrs. Harley?
What is it?
Never mind, Daisy.
I can't tell you now.
I must see Mr. Harley first.
Oh! Lily is walking with him.
- Lily's walking with that man.
- What man?
Why, It's only Mr. Slade
she's wlth.
Daisy, Mr. Slade is the Ripper.
Oh, William, thank heavens you're home.
- You must stop them.
- What are you getting at?
Don't let her go off with that man.
Helen, you've been nipping at the sherry again.
Oh, please!
William, Mr. Slade is the Ripper.
Mr. Slade is the Ripper.
- Look at that.
- What is it?
The other morning when I took him his breakfast,
I smelled something burning.
He said it was his experiment.
It was his black bag.
He burned his bag, William, right after he found out...
- the police were looking for a man with a bag.
- I see.
- Oh, is that all you can say?
- Very sensible of him.
- What?
- I said, very sensible of him.
Nobody can afford to own a bag like that now.
Come here.
A man was mobbed this morning in Trafalgar Square. They nearly tore him to pieces.
Why? Because he was carrying a little black bag. This is my black bag.
I didn't burn it because
I didn't think of it. I just hid it in here.
Anyone who owns such a bag is under suspicion.
The whole city has become hysterical.
People are flocking to the police to inform on their neighbors.
Do we have to have this nonsense in our own home?
If Slade wanted to be rid of his bag... he wouldn't leave that around for you to find.
The man isn't a fool.
You're just a little overwrought, that's all, old girl.
How about a spot of sherry?
I think you better have one too, Daisy.
Oh, I don't mind if I do, sir.
I rather wish we could talk again sometime.
You've done something good for me.
Then perhaps you will have tea with me.
- Tomorrow?
- I'd be delighted.
Thank you, Miss Bonner.
Hello, Chief.
We're in trouble.
A meeting has been called.
The high commissioner resigned this morning, and Her Majesty accepted.
- Resigned?
- Too much pressure on the Ripper case.
If we could find a fingerprint-
Fingerprints?
That won't help.
I know that theory-
No two prints alike.
It's nonsense.
No, we'll have to do better than that, Paul, or we'll have no jobs.
Perhaps you could put aside your social life...
and help us do something
about the Rlpper, eh?
Yes, sir.
Must you stop?
If I must choose between music and you, l- I will choose you.
More tea?
Yes, thank you.
Do you enjoy
Robert Browning's poetry?
Sometimes.
Depends on my mood.
I read this author or that one as I feel like it.
I like to pretend that it was all written for me.
Perhaps it was.
Every so often, a woman lives for whom men do all things.
I'm only a woman like any other.
Not like any other.
You don't know, Miss Bonner, about the others.
Are you saying that you like me?
Miss Bonner, it has done me great good to know you.
It has? How?
Oh, I- I'm afraid it's a long and very personal story... and I should dislike troubling you with it.
I already know.
You are a man very much alone... and you need to find those who will love you.
And when you do, you won't be lonely anymore.
Those who will love me?
Is it really true that you dislike actresses?
I seem to have touched on an old wound. I'm sorry.
No!
Yes. I wlll tell you.
My mother was an actress.
She was one of the most angellcally
beautlful women who ever Ilved- exquisitely graceful, talented and captivating.
I loved her deeply.
Deeply.
She had the face ofheaven... and the wretched heart of Jezebel.
For every aspect of beauty she possessed... she contained a double portion of evil.
- I hated her.
- But I thought you said you loved her.
One can love the beauty and hate the evil.
Didn't you know that, Miss Bonner?
Come.
I will show you.
I didn't mean to do this, but now I've begun, I will finish.
I will show you this face, and you will see for yourself... that there was no way for my poor father to know... that she was cunning and faithless and rotten.
It's not difficult to understand that my father fell in love with her.
Perhaps she never met a man she didn't entice.
She knew no love, only lust.
She betrayed my father a hundred times... and when she finally left him for a young, rich Frenchman...
- my father killed himself.
- Oh.
Not with a gun, with absinthe- with a thousand green glasses of absinthe.
Part of my growing up was spent with a drunken man... who searched the face of every passing girl in Paris- who spent 10 years dying of a broken heart.
And your mother?
Did you never see her again?
Yes.
Yes, I saw her.
She had become a woman of the streets.
And it was in the streets that she died.
Then they must be
In Mr. Slade's room.
Lily.
Excuse me, Mr. Slade.
- Inspector Warwick is here to see Lily.
- I forgot.
I, on the other hand, did not forget, and here I am.
Mr. Slade.
We're going to the Black Museum at Scotland Yard. Would you like to come along?
Is it all right if Mr. Slade comes with us?
I don't believe Mr. Slade would really enjoy himself.
Do come.
Yes. Yes, I believe
I'd like to come.
I'll bejust a moment.
 And these are the death masks
of various murderers.
That one was publlcly hanged
outside Newgate Prison slx months ago.
You can see the rope marks on the neck.
You treat them like trophies- like a stuffed elk head mounted over the fireplace.
Yes, a little. But these were more dangerous than an elk.
- Man, unfortunately, is the most dangerous of all beasts.
- Man is not beast.
Murderers are beasts.
There are the ropes that were actually used to hang these men.
To me, it's the noose that's the wickedest looking.
It hangs so calmly, making a graceful loop, neatly tied-
a simple deslgn, by which
a man's breath Is caught...
and forfelted for his crime.
I'm afraid I'm making
Mr. Slade a little queasy.
If you'd prefer to wait for us outside-
It's not the rope. It's your policeman's philosophy, Inspector Warwick.
Perhaps I'm too used to murder.
I must seem callous.
Miss Bonner, I have
a question to ask you.
Just one?
I have dozens to ask you.
- You too?
- Yes.
For instance, what was that used for?
Oh, that was used in the Tufnell Park murder.
And would you come Friday
for tea at my home?
- I'd Ilke some frlends to meet you.
- Hmm, I see.
What was that used for,
Inspector Warwlck?
That is a poker, with which some poor chap beat his sweetheart to death.
- Why did he do it?
- We never found out exactly, but my belief at this moment... is that she failed to answer some perfectly simple question... like "Will you come to tea?"
Very well, Inspector. I'll come.
That table is expressly reserved for one murderer.
The Rlpper?
Those are plctures of the five victims.
Ah, there you are, Paul.
I wanted to pay my compliments to our distinguished and beautiful visitor.
May I present Chief Inspector Melville,
Miss Bonner.
- How do you do?
- How do you do, Miss Bonner?
- And Mr. Slade.
- Mr. Slade.
I've been to the palace,
Miss Bonner... where I heard Prince Edward say the most complimentary things about you.
- Why, thank you.
- Also, I was told that Her Majesty has decided... that the Ripper can't possibly be an Englishman.
Now I suppose we shall have to investigate all foreigners.
Not long ago, we were to investigate all bachelors... because he couldn't possibly be a married man.
Has Paul told you that he's our expert on Jack the Ripper?
He even clalms to be able to predict
the time of each murder.
There is a strange periodicity to the Ripper's crimes.
It's as if the need to kill surges inside of him up to a peak, is satisfied...
and then Is qulet untll the compulsion slowly
bullds up agaln to another cllmax.
- When do you expect another?
- Two days ago.
He's broken the pattern now.
Usually it's every five or six days.
It could come anytime. Perhaps he Is sated.
- Sated?
- If you're ready to go, Miss Bonner...
- I would be dellghted to take you home.
- Oh, not yet.
Then I hope you will forgive me if I go on.
I have seen all I care to see of Inspector Warwick's little museum.
Inspector Melville.
Inspector Warwick.
Your police methods will never trap the one you call Jack the Ripper.
You may be rlght
about the periodiclty...
but I doubt If the beast
you describe can be sated.
He must do his work agaln.
Good afternoon.
Them fellas on horses have a real cushy job of it, all right, huh?
Aye.
Five thousand of us.
We ought to lay our hands on that fella pretty soon.
Aye, soon.
And I hope it's me what does it.
To make up for-you know.
Oh, whoosh, man, whoosh.
It wasn't your fault that poor Katy got murdered.
How could you know that she didn't live...
- where she said she did?
- Aye, that's all very well.
Oh, for the love of Mike, will you cheer up?
You're depressin' the life out of me. Shh.
That's an Irish voice, I tell ya.
I'd stake me soul on it.
I suppose you wouldn't consider a little drop of somethin' to, uh... help guard ourselves against the cool of the night?
Come along, man.
- Thank you.
- Come agaln, Mary.
- Oh, good evening, sirs.
- Good evening.
- Good evening.
- It was like a breath of home to hear you, miss.
- Oh, you're an Irishman.
- Well, there's no denyin' that.
Well now, would you be averse to walkin' a girl to her home?
- Oh, I'd like nothin' better, miss.
- Oh, you're very kind.
I've only just come to London to seek me fortune on the stage.
And mayhap we'll get there if I don't have to be walking home alone at night.
Well, you'll not be walkin' home alone on my beat, Miss, uh-
Lenihan. Mary Lenihan.
Ah, it is the breath of home to hear you, Miss Lenihan.
Uh, would it be askin' too much to hear you sing again?
I heard very little of that song in the pub back there.
Why, sure, I will.
Me thanks to you, gentlemen.
Good night, sir.
- Good night.
- It was our pleasure, Miss Lenihan.
And... good luck to you.
Thanks.
Aye, she has a sweet voice, but we have our duty.
Come on, lad.
No. Please.
What's the matter?
What happened?
- How long ago?
- We just left her. Only a few moments.
- Did anyone come out of here?
- We saw no one, sir.
Then he might still be in the building.
Put a cordon around this block.
- Yes, sir.
- Search all these bulldings.
No one on the roof, sir.
He can't get out of this, if he's human.
I'm afraid he isn't human, sir.
Not and do what he did to that girl.
What are you doing?
I am burning my ulster.
Don't come too close.
Those-What are those stains?
They look like blood.
I was carrying a solution in a glass container-
I- Part of my experiment.
I fell and it broke.
My ulster became contaminated.
I- I must be quick, drastic... or the contamination could easily spread.
Contamination?
- You mean it may carry a disease?
- Yes.
- What happened to the dog?
- I'm afraid I hurt him.
He jumped up to greet me.
I didn't want him to touch the ulster.
Dogs can carry human disease.
There. It's done.
You were right about the Ripper.
You were probably busy and didn't hear.
- Hear what?
- There was another Ripper murder tonight.
You said he would do it.
How did you know?
I didn't know.
Your Inspector Warwick made me angry.
I don't know why I said it.
What is it?
Everyone distrusts me.
I feel it. Even you.
I work very hard.
I do what I must do.
I- I am myself.
I don't distrust you.
Forgive me.
I'm- I'm very tired.
Is there anything I can do for you?
We must each live with ourselves.
Yes.
What's happened?
What's that smell?
Anything wrong?
- No, Uncle.
- I'm sorry. I had to use the stove.
Hmm.
All this writing about investigations and not a single clue yet.
William, we must go to the police.
What for?
I don't believe Mr. Slade burned his ulster because it was contaminated.
He wanted to get rid of those blood spots.
Well, uh, Lily said she believed him.
- I'm sorry.
- Hmm? What's the matter?
Well, here's his breakfast tray... but I don't want to take it.
I don't know what to think of him.
I'll take the tray and settle this business once and for all.
Wllllam. Wllllam.
Don't do anything silly.
I never do anything silly.
Great heavens, man.
Don't you ever sleep?
This experiment is very difficult.
Any more danger of that contamination?
I think not.
You are suspicious too.
Well, I am a pathologist, Mr. Harley, and I am working on blood diseases.
You can check on my work at the university hospital.
Hmm. Of Course. Of course.
Did you come to ask me to move away?
It has happened before.
Move away?
No, sir. Certainly not.
Why, you're perfectly welcome here... and I'll see to it that you stay welcome.
And now then, you- you'd better eat some breakfast, what?
- Thank you.
- Eat hearty.
Come in.
Oh, do come in, Mr. Slade.
I came to thank you for your reminder.
- The theater.
- Oh, yes.
- I will come tonight.
- Splendid.
I'm so happy. I think it will do you a lot of good... to forget work for a while and really enjoy yourself.
I believe there's some tea.
- Now suppose you take off your ulster and stay a minute.
- I'm not disturbing you?
No. Of course not. I was merely writing a few thank you notes for flowers.
And most particularly to Inspector Warwlck?
I shall be able to thank him in person.
He's coming tonight too.
You don't like
Inspector Warwick, do you?
He thinks you are
a most Interesting man.
He asked me all sorts
of questions about you.
Wait here, Bates.
Yes, may I help you?
I wish to inquire if you have a Dr. Slade in your hospital.
Dr. Slade?
No, we do not.
Thank you.
We have a Mr. Slade who works in research.
He's a pathologist.
- Do you wish to see him?
- No, not immediately. Thank you.
Just as well.
He isn't here.
Have you seen him recently?
As recently as last night.
- Is he here very much?
- Almost every day and night.
He works late quite often.
He's a most respected member of our staff.
- Good evening, Daisy.
- Oh, good evening, Inspector Warwick.
Am I too early?
Oh, I think Miss Lily will be down in a minute.
Will you sit in there, sir?
- What's the trouble, Daisy?
- Oh.
I don't know.
I'm as jumpy as a cat.
What's the matter?
Well, it's the back and forth and back and forth.
Back and forth?
Well, first Mrs. Harley says he's the Ripper himself.
And then Mr. Harley
proves It's all nonsense.
What do you mean?
Well, first he burns his black bag... and then Mr. Harley pooh-poohs that... and show us his own hidden in the chest.
And then he burns his ulster, which had all the blood on it.
- Daisy, wait a moment.
What are you talking about?
- Well, Mr. Slade-
Oh, it's all mixed up.
And I'm not supposed to say.
Mr. Harley says it's just woman's hysteria.
Wait a minute.
- Good evening, Inspector Warwick.
- Oh, good evening, sir.
- You've come for Lily?
- Yes.
Perhaps a nip of sherry will help us pass the time.
Mr. Harley... what is this about Slade?
Helen's been at you, has she?
Well, no. As a matter of fact,
Daisy mentioned it.
Look here, old man. Everything about Slade can be logically explained.
Except one thing.
The dog's suddenly gone sour on him.
Still, that doesn't prove anything, does it?
You'd better tell me about it, Mr. Harley.
I tell you this, Lily.
No matter what you say...
I don't believe you ought to spend too much time alone with him.
Aunt Helen.
Dear, sweet Aunt Helen.
What if I were to tell you that it was
Mr. Slade who was in danger, not I?
Why, Lily!
I think this thing can be settled tonight.
This is a copy of a thumbprint the Ripper left in the room...
- of Mary Lenihan, the last victim.
- Thumbprint?
There's a theory that there are no two fingerprints in the world that are exactly alike.
- I happen to subscribe to it.
- Hmm.
Could you get me something that Slade has held in his right hand?
A glass or something?
Well, frankly, I don't know.
Mr. Harley, wouldn't you feel more secure if we cleared it up?
Yes, I suppose so.
The fact is, the fellow's gone out.
We might try looking about his room.
Well, that would be fine.
I rather hate to, you know.
Prying into a man's belongings.
Mr. Harley.
Yes.
Helen tells me Mr. Slade frequently reads the Bible.
Murderers don't read Bibles, do they?
There might be some prints here.
I'd like to take something smaller- something he wouldn't immediately miss.
Oh, this will do.
Now something more.
Locked, eh?
I say, should you do that, old man?
A policeman never knows what he should do... until it's proved to be the right thing.
Oh, this probably has both prints.
Handkerchief.
- I say-
- I'll bring it back... and your handkerchief.
Don't fuss, Aunt Helen.
Gentlemen don't mind walting for ladles.
They're qulte used to It.
- What do we do?
- Shh.
- Do you have everything, dear?
- Yes, Auntle. Stop worrylng.
Well, I can't help It.
There's something In the alr tonlght.
She's feeling things again.
I thought Mr. Slade had gone out.
There's a Ilght In here.
- What is this?
- I'm sorry, Miss Bonner.
You've been snooping through Mr. Slade's things.
Very well. There's been a mystery about this gentleman... and I wish to clear it up once and for all.
I'm quite tired of this.
Why don't you leave the poor man alone?
- He went out early to avold meeting you.
- Oh? Where did he go?
He'll be at the theater later to see me.
Perhaps you can hang him there.
I merely want
to ask some questions.
- What did you find ofhis?
- I found this.
- That's his mother.
- His mother?
Of course.
He told me about her.
Poor woman. She died an alcoholic in the slums of Whitechapel.
What else did he tell you?
He seemed quite confused about his feelings for her- love and resentment all mixed up together.
Please, Paul, leave the poor man alone.
You defend him with quite a lot of spirit, Miss Bonner.
I know him better than any of you.
I like him. I feel sorry for him.
As a friend, I should like to respect your fondness for Mr. Slade... but I am also a policeman.
You most certainly are.
You needn't bother to take me to the theater tonight.
Good night, Inspector.
- If I may say so, sir-
- And if I said you may not say it?
Then I wouldn't, sir.
- If I may ask, sir-
- Bates.
If it seems to you I'm in a nasty mood tonight, you're right, and I have cause.
No, you may not ask.
You may not say so.
You may do absolutely nothing except breathe quietly.
Yes, sir.
Nothing matches, and every print of his right hand is here.
- It's not Slade, that's all.
- Sir-
This print couldn't have been made by the Ripper's left hand.
Not unless every detective at the yard is wrong.
That's most unlikely, isn't it, sir?
The victim's cuts show that the Ripper used his knife... from right to left across the throat while attacking from behind.
That means he used his left hand.
He took his victims like this.
The cut of the knife was like this.
Sir, have you observed
Mr. Slade to be left-handed?
No, I haven't.
But he could still use his left hand... if he attacked from behind.
You know, for the first time it occurs to me... that the Ripper need not have attacked from behind.
In which case, he could make the same cut from the front with his right hand.
- Yes, sir.
- If that's so, we must find a left thumbprint... to match the print of the Ripper's.
About that portrait, sir-
I have a peculiar memory for faces.
- You do?
- Yes, sir.
I believe that to be the face of Ann Lawrence.
Even to the mole on the left cheek.
Bates, you're right. Slade's mother was the first Ripper victim.
Where is Slade?
Have you seen him?
Yes, he's right down there.
He's gone.
Lovely, lovely.
You were lovely.
- They liked us, didn't they?
- They worshipped you.
Excuse me.
- Am I under arrest, Mr. Policeman?
- Where is Slade?
Inspector Warwick,
I'm very sick of all this.
- He's the Ripper.
- Oh, do go away. You're out of your mind.
Lelah, I don't want you to let anyone in.
There's a gentleman in here, Miss Lily.
Hello.
May I... talk to you alone?
I have to make a change.
Uh, there isn't much time.
All right, Lelah.
Please.
Well, how did you like the show?
You are exquisite, Lily.
Good. For a moment, I thought you disliked the whole thing. You looked so glum.
I hated it. I hated your beauty being exposed for everyone to ogle.
I hated the looks on men's faces.
Well, without those looks on their faces, I'd be finished.
You're more wonderful and more- more sweetly beautiful than anyone I've ever known.
Everything in my life has changed because of you.
Help me.
Help me.
You pick the strangest moments.
I need you, Lily.
Only you can save me.
- Save you?
- Come away with me right now.
Come away with me- anywhere in the world you say.
I want to live close to you without sharing you.
Close. Close.
I think there's something you should understand.
I'm fond of you, but I'm not ready to be taken over.
I Ilke a man wlth passlon, but I don't want
a slave, and I don't want to be one.
Besides, I wouldn't dream of giving up the theater.
All I've said makes no difference to you.
I didn't say that.
You want to go on exciting men to wanting you... go on using your beauty to corrupt, to degrade.
- Please.
- You're mocking me!
Miss Llly?
The same as my mother.
The same as all of them.
- Miss Llly, are you all rlght?
- Mocking love, living for lust.
You are evil.
Your beauty is evil.
It must be cut away.
No. No.
You said you loved me.
Please.
Miss Llly?
Miss Llly?
Miss Llly, are you all rlght?
Lily!
Are you all right?
Halt!
Get a doctor.
Hey!
Yah! Yah!
Yah! Hah!
Yah!
- Can't you go faster, man?
- Hah!
Are you hurt, sir?
I am a doctor.
Take care of my horses.
I must hurry.
- Where is he?
- You mean the doctor?
He turned the corner too fast and crashed a wheel.
Quickly, man, that was the Ripper!
- Circle around that way.
- Here! Over this way!
- What is it?
- What are they after?
Shine your lights over here!
- It's the Ripper!
- He's in the river.
- There's something! Over there!
- Where?
Look! By the bridge!
It's too dark, and it's too deep.
We'll never get him now.
Not so dark and not so deep as where he's going.
The history of the Haymarket Strangler. It's all here.
Five unfortunates lured to their doom...
half-strangled and slashed to death.
Here you are. Only a penny.
The history of Edward Styles, the Haymarket Strangler.
He terrorized the metropolis.
Five young women murdered in as many months.
The life story of Martha Stuart.
Only a ha'penny. An eyewitness account of the Haymarket orgies.
Martha's last night atJudas Hole.
Only a hapenny.
The life story of Edward Styles.
Five lovely young girls slashed to death.
Only a hapenny gets the infamous history of the Haymarket Strangler.
It's all here.
Five unfortunates lured to their doom.
No! But I didn't...
I never knew Martha Stuart!
I'm innocent!
You can't hang me for the murder of Martha Stuart!
Listen! I didn't do it!
You're getting your just deserts!
Cover him well over.
Quicklime is cheap enough.
We therefore commit his body to the ground.
Earth to earth, ashes to ashes... dust to dust.
Doctor Tenant's fainted!
Quick, give us a hand.
I've been back over the records and given you at least a dozen cases.
Why on earth choose this one?
It's the one clear case that'll prove my point.
If Styles had had the money to buy an adequate defense...
- He never would have hanged.
- Very well. Let's take this to my offce.
- There's more fresh air up there.
- Right.
I don't know why you social reformers always want to play detective to prove your theories.
Because you detectives always leave such gaps in your investigations.
Well, that doesn't apply to me.
I wasn't on this case.
- Now, then, what is it you want?
- There was a Dr. Horsely, the police surgeon on the case.
I'd like to see his report.
Ah, yes.
Yes, here it is.
I don't know what you expect to find.
If ever a case was proved, this one was.
Oh, no, Burk. There's nothing in Styles's life to show that he was capable of such violence.
Except for this.
Here's positive identifcation of Styles.
A dozen people saw him that night in theJudas Hole.
Why, one of them, Cora Seth, she still sings there.
It's quite impossible for her to have mistaken a one-armed man.
Is the knife still in the box?
You nearly had me that time.
- You know it isn't.
- No, and it never was found.
That's one of the gaps
I was talking about.
Here's what I want.
A young doctor, named Tenant,
Horsely's assistant.
Horsely sent him to do the autopsy on Styles's body.
Well, the law demands an autopsy on anyone who's died an unnatural death.
Tenant collapsed at Styles's graveside.
- Well, you said he was a young fellow.
- Young, perhaps, but not squeamish.
Look, it's all here. Five young women brutally murdered in the neighborhood.
- And the autopsy on all of them was performed by Tenant.
- What are you suggesting?
Why, that he might know as much about the murders as anybody else.
But I can't find him.
He never went back to Horsely... not even to collect the salary that was owed him.
Why did he disappear so soon after Styles was hanged?
It looks as though you're concocting some far-fetched theory out of your imagination.
Is it so far-fetched? I wonder if he knew that Styles was innocent.
I wonder if he was hiding something.
My dear Rankin, I've known you for an awful long time.
Allow me to tell you
I've never heard such rubbish in my life.
How can you call it rubbish if you don't even know why Tenant disappeared?
But I do. Look, it's all here in Horsely's report.
Here. Tenant was admitted at Guy's Hospital seriously ill.
It was from there he disappeared.
Where are you going?
To Guy's Hospital of course, to concoct another far-fetched theory.
Yes, here it is.
The third.
"Dr. Tenant admitted.
Brought in from Newgate Prison unconscious."
Ah, yes.
"Suffering from hallucinations, loss of memory... and some form of paralysis of the left side."
Here is an opinion that
"if the hallucinations...
"and attacks of paralysis with accompanying violence continue... he must be certifed and confned to an asylum."
- Is that what you want?
- It makes no mention of the fact of his disappearance?
It says here, "Dr. Tenant missing from his room. Authorities notified."
- And that's all.
- Only a note.
"In the event of any person claiming Dr. Tenant's possessions...
I have placed them in the lost property room, pigeonhole number 602."
If they're still there,
I'd like to see them.
Well, it's strictly against the regulations, of course.
- But should we look in the pigeonhole first...
- Thank you.
Ah, here we are, sir.
Safe as the day it was placed there.
Now, let me test my memory.
That'll be Dr. Tenant.
Yes, that's the one.
Quite a scandal there was about it at the time.
- We old ones still talk about it.
- Scandal? What sort of scandal?
Well, the young nurse who ran away with him.
The doctors all said he was mad.
She thought she knew better.
And when the asylum van came, no patient, no nurse.
- I never heard what became of them.
- Do you remember the name of the nurse?
I'm afraid you've got me there, sir.
Very quiet.
Very quiet and reserved she was.
- Do you have records that go that far back?
- It would mean quite a search.
It would be a great help if I could have that information.
And if I could borrow these things.
I should have to consult my superiors of course.
But I think it could be arranged.
- Will you come this way?
- Yes, thank you.
- Ah, good evening, Hannah.
- Good evening, sir.
- Has Dr. McColl come yet?
- Yes, sir.
He's in the conservatory with Miss Lily.
Shall I tell him you've come back?
No, I'll find him all right.
By the way.
How's that young scamp of a brother of yours?
Oh, sir, he's doing very well. He's got himself a job as a porter at Covent Garden.
Well, good.
That will keep him out of mischief.
Ma and I will never forget what you did for him, sir.
Well, no need for him to go to prison simply because he had bad friends.
Is that you, Jim?
Aren't they beautiful?
Now, don't frown. I've been most careful not to touch any of your precious papers.
- Thank you, my dear.
- Did you have a good day?
Splendid, I made great strides.
How much longer are these investigations going on?
I'm afraid the end isn't quite in sight, Barbara.
But it's all past.
That man was dead and buried
20 years ago. Let him rest.
I know I can't bring Styles back from the dead.
But one could force a change in the legal system... so that a poor man would have a lawyer to defend him.
Styles's was a typical case, and there'll be plenty of others.
- Jim, I realize how much...
- I must find this young assistant of mine.
By the way, we're going out again.
We won't be back for dinner.
- I wanted to talk to you about Lily.
- Later, dear.
Ken, you must never return to Canada.
- I couldn't bear it.
- Unless you come with me as my wife.
But that won't be for years.
Not until you've completed your studies.
Psychological medicine seems such a big thing.
Darling, it's new. When I win my diploma, think of the prospect... a new idea in a new country.
With you at my side, nobody can stop me.
I can't wait.
- Ah, there you are, McColl.
- Good evening, sir.
I'm sorry, Papa.
I didn't know you were back.
Evening, Lily. My boy, just give me a hand with this table.
As usual, Burk was most helpful.
Showed me the complete fle on the Styles case.
The trail led to Guy's Hospital where I found these things.
They belong to Dr. Tenant.
First of all, a letter.
- From Australia?
- Yes, from a sheep farmer named Temple... saying he can give him work on his station up-country when he gets there.
Then another letter from a shipping company... offering him a berth on a grain ship... but saying arrival in Sydney can't be guaranteed under six months.
And here's the actual ticket, unused.
- He never left England.
- Exactly.
And that's not all.
The usual paraphernalia... stethoscope, surgical dressing... and an instrument case from which a surgeon's knife is missing.
- I don't follow you, sir.
- What was the last case... that he was employed on before we lost sight of him?
- You mean the autopsy on Styles?
- Exactly.
An autopsy on which a surgeon's knife would be an essential instrument... also the perfect instrument for murder.
Excuse me, sir.
There's a cab waiting.
- Says you ordered him.
- Thank you, Hannah.
Get your coat, McColl.
Come on, giddap. Giddap.
As you will see, the contents of
Tenant's notebook are most revealing.
Intimate details of the killings of all fve girls.
Details that go far beyond an ordinary, routine report on an autopsy.
Why was he so fascinated by these gruesome details?
Well, he was young. Perhaps he took trouble to follow through on the cases.
- I would want to myself.
- I doubt that very much, my boy.
I regard it more as the abnormal, morbid streak... that is quite lacking in everything we know of Styles... but could be used to build a case against Tenant.
There is a point
I think you overlook, sir.
- Tenant had the use of both arms.
- I know, I know.
And the women were only half-strangled and then slashed to death.
Of course it's perfectly true
Styles was a one-armed man.
But we mustn't overlook the word
"paralysis" in Tenant's case history.
I see we're getting close to our destination.
- Where is that, sir?
- The place where the last victim was killed... and where Styles was caught and identifed... and the place that is mentioned so often in Tenant's notebook: theJudas Hole.
Would you give this note to Miss Cora Seth, please?
Certainly, sir. Would you be good enough to wait up there?
- My girls are good, eh?
- Oh, very, but...
I really came to see Cora Seth.
Oh, well, give her time.
Twenty years is a long while to think back.
- Miss Seth will be with you in just a few moments, sir.
- Thank you.
- Give us a song!
- Cora!
Hiya, boys.
- This him?
- Yes, it is.
- You're not the police?
- Purely private business.
That's different.
Your billet-doux about the Haymarket
Strangler gave me quite a turn.
I was only about 1 7 when I helped send
Martha Stuart's killer to the gallows.
- Oh, you're drunk!
- I'm not drunk. I've never been drunk...
And I shall never, never be drunk.
Take this lout away from me.
I'm soaked to the skin.
I don't think a handkerchief will be suffcient.
Where can I take you?
Bring my fan.
Pearl may be your prodigy... but you'll have to teach her to handle a man better than that.
She's young. She'll learn.
Well, don't stand there.
Bring it in.
Come on, girls.
Out of the way.
Come here. I haven't thanked you yet for taking that lout off of my hands.
It was a pleasure.
There. That was nice, wasn't it?
Come on, ducky. Over here.
- Well, sit down. No need to be uncomfortable.
- Thank you.
Well, now, Mr. Rankin.
What can I do for you?
Well, I'm a novelist.
I'm about to write a pamphlet based on the Haymarket Strangler murders.
- You mean Edward Styles?
- It's not about Styles I want to talk.
There was a young doctor here the night of the murder... a certain Dr. Tenant.
- Dick Tenant. He was here.
- You knew him?
Yes, he was always about, pestering us girls.
- Why do you say "pestering"?
- Well, you know.
In and out. Night after night.
Bottles of champagne.
I never knew why a young doctor like him should want to go rampaging around the town.
He didn't seem cut out for it, if you know what I mean.
- Well, as a matter of fact, I don't...
- A fne thing, Cora.
He rescues me, and I offer to thank him.
And what does he do? Asks for his friend who's talking to Cora, he says.
- The gentlemen are here on business, Pearl.
- Business? A fne story.
- What business have you got?
- My business.
And you wrap yourself up and get back to yours.
- Well...
- Go on! Don't you sauce me, you little bit!
You old trull!
Little baggage.
She won't come to much harm, a girl with spirit like that, eh?
We were talking of Dr. Tenant.
Was he fond of anyone in particular?
- He'd have liked to have been.
- You, for instance?
No. I wouldn't let him lay a fnger on me.
Why do you say that?
I don't know.
You can't account for feelings.
It was just something in the way he looked at you.
When he touched you, it was...
Anyway, he didn't want me.
It was Martha Stuart he was after.
The girl who was murdered?
Poor Martha.
I'll never forget that night, not as long as I live.
I was in here, you know. When I heard that terrible scream, I went rushing out.
And I was just in time to see that one-armed creature running away.
Are you quite sure that it was Styles?
- Are you calling me a liar?
- The face, did you see the face?
I didn't have to see his face. I could tell that one-armed outline anywhere.
What sort of a girl was Martha Stuart?
Funny thing, that.
She was as like Pearl as two peas.
Well, I've gotta change.
If you two gents don't want an eyeful, you'd better get out.
Quite, quite.
That woman's identifcation of Styles is worthless.
Exactly.
But what she had to say about Dr. Tenant is quite another matter.
Now, McColl.
I want his whole history investigated. just as thoroughly as we did with Styles.
Yes, sir.
Barbara, you didn't wait up for me?
I told you, dear.
I want to talk to you.
So you did. I'm sorry, but in the excitement of the evening, I quite forgot.
- Jim, what I wanted to say is...
- I know.
- That I shouldn't go on wasting my time.
- No, it wasn't. But I will say one thing.
You shouldn't meddle with things that are outside your knowledge.
You mustn't, Jim.
You mustn't. I beg of you.
I'm sorry, Barbara, but a man must do the work in which he believes.
I'm sorry, dear. All I ask is that you don't overtax your strength, make yourself ill.
I won't. I've nearly fnished. And then I can turn the summaries over to McColl.
It's about him I want to talk.
He and Lily like each other very much.
Barbara.
You see a romance everywhere.
Now surely you didn't wait up just to tell me that.
I did. Lily's spoken to me about it.
- I think she's in love with him.
- Well, in that case...
I'll just have to give the young man enough work to keep him occupied.
And so far as I'm concerned, dear...
I promise you that very soon
I'll settle down again... and write another long, three-volume novel... suitable for the most genteel of young women.
And my last inquiry, sir, was at the medical school.
Tenant's examination results were brilliant, but he was an erratic student.
Well done, McColl.
So there we have it.
A father who beat his son unmercifully.
A mother who drank and didn't care.
Interrupted studies, but a brilliant mind... and carousing in places like theJudas Hole.
Where we find that at least one woman refused him...
- And another couldn't bear his touch.
- Yeah.
He'd have a need to revenge himself.
Five times over in cold blood?
Perhaps he had a compulsion to kill.
Afterwards, in his lucid moments... he might bitterly regret his actions.
He might even forget them altogether.
You mean he killed while he was in some sort of a trance?
I can only theorize, sir.
Yes, but it's a theory that applies to a man... who had intermittent attacks of paralysis and great fts of violence.
Well, I can't contradict you, sir.
He was trying to cut himself off from his old life by going to Australia.
Perhaps in an effort to rid himself of the compulsion to kill... he discarded the knife that had become the symbol of the murders.
- Well, it's an explanation, sir, but...
- Where was the last place that he would've had the knife?
Well, I suppose he had it at Styles's autopsy...
- Before the burial.
- Exactly.
So the knife must be hidden in the most obvious place.
- Where?
- You can't deny it, McColl.
In Styles's coffn.
I tell you, Rankin.
I can't accept your theory.
My commissioner would throw me out in the street if I were to present such fiimsy evidence.
In any case, it's pure supposition.
A lot of psychological hot air.
Give me that, McColl.
Is that supposition?
I ask you, where is the knife that should lie in that groove?
- Was this Tenant's?
- It was.
Again I ask you, where is the knife?
Well, it's not the first time a surgeon's lost a scalpel, is it?
How dare you disparage my opinions!
I'm going to find that knife and hold it under your nose and make you apologize.
I demand that...
- Mr. Rankin, don't.
- I will say it, McColl.
Burk, I demand the exhumation of Edward Styles's body.
I'm sorry, Rankin.
But please don't drive me too far.
And don't make a fool of yourself.
I'm going to make an offcial demand for the exhumation of Styles's body.
If you won't help me, to whom shall I make it?
Well, if you must, I suppose the governor of Newgate Prison. But I warn you...
Good day to you.
And I'm sorry I can't add thanks.
- You had no right to admit him.
- I gave you the letter, sir.
Well, let him wait.
Take it back with my compliments...
And see him off the premises.
This way, sir.
- Sir.
- Who are you?
- I sent you that letter in all good faith.
- I never read such nonsense in my life.
To exhume a prisoner sentenced and executed 20 years ago... for the whim of a scribbling novelist.
- I stated my reasons quite clearly.
- Reasons? That claptrap?
I tell you, I knew the man.
I had the privilege of seeing him go to the scaffold.
And if ever a blackguardly ruffan deserved his sentence, it was Edward Styles.
I'll not let it rest here.
I'll go to higher authority. I warn you.
Oh, you're warning me?
All we had was the condemned cell.
It isn't everyone what can stomach a whipping.
I was talking to the governor.
Where is he?
Now, now, take it easy, sir.
You've had a nasty turn.
You're free to go whenever you like.
The previous occupant wasn't so lucky.
His nibs instructed me to return this letter.
- He did, did he?
- Begging your pardon, sir.
The governor acquainted me with the contents.
Of course, he ain't a free agent.
He's hemmed in by rules and regulations.
- You follow me?
- I think I do.
Do you know the location of the grave?
Do I? I helped to bury him.
Packed him in quicklime, I did.
He was a lovely ft. We couldn't get him in till we got his clothes off.
- Not half an inch either way.
- Please.
They don't use that graveyard, not once in weeks.
Now if someone was to let you in the gate late at night...
- Someone what knew where the coffiin lay...
- Are you suggesting that you would...
Of course, there'd have to be a consideration for his trouble beforehand.
There'll be no trouble about the money, but how can I be sure that...
I thought we were speaking as gentleman to gentleman.
There's your letter.
Be off with you.
No, wait a minute. Wait.
Must you go on working, Ken?
Yes, darling. Your father expects these summaries by the morning.
You never seem to have any time for me anymore.
Now, darling.
You know that's not true.
McColl!
When I gave you the freedom of my house,
I expected you to observe certain decencies.
- Well, sir, I was going to...
- But, Father, we're going to marry.
Really? I thought it was customary for a young man to ask permission.
Father, you must have known. Mother said she tried to talk to you about it.
I've no real objection to your joining my family, McColl.
But I do wish you'd said something to me.
It's bad enough being blocked and frustrated by the authorities at every turn... without having you add to my anxieties.
We had no such intentions, Papa.
I'll see that he works harder than ever.
He'll have to if I'm successful tonight.
- Do you want me to come with you, sir?
- Thank you, no, McColl.
You can't help me.
Ken, I'm so happy.
I think he means to give his approval.
I'm not so sure. Since the day we went to Burk's offce, I've...
I've lost his confdence.
- I disagreed with him.
- Then first thing tomorrow morning...
- Tell him how sorry you are.
- Yes, I will.
- But I must talk to Burk again.
- Yes, but not now, Ken.
No, not now.
You've got three hours, so you'll have your work cut out.
Wait a minute.
I'll be back at 2:00.
And mind you're gone. You'll find a spade over there in the corner.
But, Mama, why should I wait so long?
Your father hasn't yet told me that he approves, Lily.
And in any case, dear, it was very wrong of you... to encourage Dr. McColl without speaking to me in the first place.
Now run along upstairs.
I'll come and talk to you presently.
Please, mum.
Shall I lock the front door?
No, Hannah, not yet.
Mr. Rankin isn't home.
- Did he say where he was going?
- No.
But I expect it's some meeting to carry his investigations further.
Did you see that young man sitting at one of the tables just near to us?
Oh, lovely.
Pearl! Pearl, where are you?
Pearl, can you hear me?
Oh, shut up, Cora!
What do you want?
Come and do me up.
I'm getting too fat.
All right.
I'll be over in a minute.
Open up, dears.
Where's this from?
Quiet. A present from Major Fortescue.
Yeah, he sends his compliments... and he said he wants you all to join him in fresh bottles...
When these are empty.
- Good night. Come again soon.
- I shall, my Pearl.
You give an edge to a man's inclinations.
Next time I shall bring you a stone to match your name.
Oh, two.
Set in gold.
I'll have one here...
And one here.
Pearl! I can't wait all night!
Oh, shut up!
You'd better go, otherwise Cora will miss her entrance, and then London will never be the same.
George, see His Lordship off.
- Good night.
- This way, sir.
And about time too!
Can't you learn to keep your big mouth shut?
Now, you listen to me, my girl.
Until you're a great deal older and I'm sure you can pick 'em right... you're gonna stay right here under my wing.
Not if you're gonna spoil the chances I do get.
You nearly lost me a pair of pearl earrings.
Pearl earrings.
Before I've fnished with you... it'll be diamond necklaces.
You be patient, my Pearl.
- I'll make you the toast of the town.
- You're a good sort, Cora.
With you looking after me,
I'll do all right.
My fan.
- Right. How do we look?
- Gorgeous.
If one day I can equal it,
I'll be very happy.
You will, my love. You will.
Tell George to put a bottle of stout in my room, eh?
All right. I will.
Now Cora is a lady
I'm a girl what's doing well
I deal in nothing shady
I've got too much to sell.
It's very plain for all to see
I've got a heart of gold
So, join the queue
Enjoy the view
I'm big, I'm bad, I'm bold
All the boys adore her
She's always ready for a little bit of fun
With a duke or an earl or a younger son
But if you've got the wherewithal
To treat her as you should
For a diamond bright
She'll cuddle up tight
And maybe a little bit more-a
Cora, Cora
All the boys adore her
She's always dining with the la-di-da
And makin' 'em pay for the caviar
But if you take her fancy she won't ask you for a sou
But play your part
She'll give her heart
And maybe a little bit more-a
Now, Cora likes a dandy
A chap what's doing fiine
I'm not averse to brandy
In fact, it's quite my line
Of course I wouldn't drink a lot
I'm such a careful girl
I wouldn't blot
My copybook
Not even for an earl
Who are you?
Who let you in?
Cora
How all the boys adore her
She's always ready for a little bit of fun
With a duke or an earl or a younger son
For a diamond bright
And maybe a little bit more-a
All the boys adore her
She's always ready
It's the Haymarket Strangler!
Stop him!
Stop him!
Pearl!
You should have stayed in bed, Jim.
You're not ft to be up.
I'm sorry I frightened you, Barbara.
It... It was a nightmare.
I didn't know I was shouting.
You must let Dr. McColl examine you, dear.
You're not well. I know you don't want to worry me.
I don't want to worry anybody.
But the proof of my theories is almost within my grasp.
I know now that Styles was innocent. jim, give it up.
I beg of you with all my heart. Don't go on.
I must go on.
I can't give it up.
The man may still be alive.
I know who he is.
I know his name.
It's Tenant.
I must go to Burk. I must make him believe me. They must all believe me.
I have the proof.
Sir, there's a man here from Inspector Burk.
He wants you to join him at theJudas Hole.
Last night a girl was murdered.
Half-strangled and stabbed.
Have him wait.
I'll go with him as soon as I'm dressed.
Yes, sir.
Jim... Are my pleas useless?
Do they mean so little?
I'm committed.
I can't turn back now.
Oh, Jim.
Terrible. A young girl like that.
Everybody in the place saw the man.
The resemblance was so marked that Cora started the cry of the Haymarket Strangler... and the mob took it up as they set after him.
What can I do to help?
This is your fault.
Why did you have to go stirring up the dead?
If you'd let Martha lie peacefully in her grave...
Pearl would be alive now.
This is your doing, Mr. Rankin.
Now, Cora...
Cora, come on. Pull yourself together.
These hysterics aren't gonna help anybody.
Come on, Cora.
Try and remember what the man looked like.
I don't know anymore.
I don't know.
It was just as though
Styles had come back to life again.
It was the same man.
The very same man.
I'd tell you that if you brought me face-to-face with him now.
It was the Haymarket Strangler.
Is she right?
Would I have been wiser to let the dead rest?
I have no opinions about that, but your theories have been proved right.
There's too much similarity for this to have been coincidence.
- Rankin, are you prepared to cooperate?
- In any way that I can. This man must be stopped.
I want you to come to my offce.
For 20 years, this man's been amongst us.
Something you've either said or done has stirred his brain.
It shouldn't be diffcult to point to him now.
Burk. Any news?
Have you traced them?
No, we've been over all the early ground, but we might just as well have taken your word for it.
I've been over these papers over and over again, but the trail always ends at Guy's Hospital.
I'm on my way there this evening to go through the records, see if we can find the name of that nurse.
- Might be able to trace her.
- How can you?
The authorities were notified.
They couldn't find the runaways.
I know, but it wasn't a matter of so much urgency then.
- Burk.
- Yes?
There's one more line of investigation that I must pursue.
- I'll come with you.
- No, go on with what you're doing. This is an intimate matter.
If I'm right, you'll know soon enough. jim, where have you been?
I've been waiting and worrying.
I've been working with Burk at Scotland Yard... trying to trace the murderer of that young girl.
Tell me about it in the morning, dear.
You must get some rest.
I haven't seen you like this since...
Since when?
When did you see me like this?
Barbara, I've never pressed you on this point.
You've made me content to live as a man who only knew half of his life, but now I must know.
You must tell me.
Who is the man you took from Guy's Hospital?
Don't ask me that, Jim.
Is it an answer that I know myself?
The inevitable end of my search?
That I myself am the man that I've been hunting?
Of course that's it.
I've known it for days and been afraid to face the truth.
Why did you do it?
My only crime has been to love you, Jim.
Then out of your love, pity me and tell me.
When they brought you to the hospital, I did pity you.
You were so young.
And in the periods when you were yourself... so gentle and kind.
Always when you were in my care.
I fell in love with you.
I was a young widow with a baby to care for.
Lily... thinks of you as a father.
- What else did you know about me?
- Nothing. Nothing at all.
You were to be certifed.
I couldn't believe that you were insane.
- You took me away?
- Yes, I did.
And I encouraged you to start a new career as a novelist.
It was a fearful risk, but...
I had to create another man.
Always afraid we might be discovered.
I didn't know then that you were a murderer.
Now that you do?
The decision's no longer in my hands, Jim.
I tried to warn you... begged you to give up these investigations.
Fate has a strange way ofbringing retribution, Jim.
Styles will avenge himself on me as... well as on you.
- But I'll not desert you.
- No.
Leave me alone.
I'm mad.
Styles, the poor wretch, would have no use for a surgeon's knife.
But... Tenant would.
He was a doctor.
They're crowding in on me.
Styles and those women.
I must get to Burk before... jim, what is it?
What's the matter?
No. Don't.
I don't know where on earth he could have gone.
He was in my offce till pretty late last night, then he left to carry out some inquiries of his own.
He seemed very upset. And how on earth are we gonna tell him about this?
And this on top of everything else.
I'd like Dr. Johnson to have a look at him.
Perhaps you can make him see reason.
- I'd be glad to, McColl.
- Excuse me, sir... but I've just seen Mr. Rankin coming down the street.
Well, thank you, Hannah.
Why, Burk, what are you doing here?
Rankin...
I've got something dreadful to tell you.
Your wife was found dead in your study last night.
She'd been strangled and... and then stabbed.
Hannah said she caught sight of the murderer as he was leaving last night.
So that's what happened.
Burk, I must talk to you alone.
- Not in there.
- What difference does it make?
That is where she lay?
I told you you shouldn't have come in here.
Doesn't matter.
Burk, you must arrest me.
I killed my wife.
Now, look, Rankin.
You've had a dreadful shock.
Now, we'll find Tenant before long.
I am Tenant.
I've suspected it for a long time... but last night my wife gave me the proof.
You must not make such preposterous statements, Rankin.
I killed her with the knife that was missing from the instrument case.
It was here... here on the desk.
But how could you have found the knife?
You wouldn't help me. I found it myself.
I found it in Styles's coffn.
That's just your writer's imagination.
How could you possibly have dug up a body at Newgate Graveyard without somebody seeing you? It's pure fantasy.
The turnkey.
The turnkey who let me in. He saw me.
And the people at theJudas Hole.
- And now it's theJudas Hole.
- They'll identify me.
- Except that it wasn't you they saw.
- Hannah.
Hannah saw me.
Let me face Hannah.
Where is he, Ken?
He's in the study with Burk.
- Lily. I want you to meet Dr. Johnson.
- How do you do, Miss Rankin?
He's promised to look at Mr. Rankin in the hope that we can persuade him to rest.
I hope you succeed, Doctor.
Hannah, will you come in the study a moment, please?
- I was just gonna get Mr. Rankin his breakfast.
- Afterwards, Hannah.
Yes, sir.
I don't understand.
Why should anyone want to hurt Mama?
What are you trying to do, trap me?
I'm not used to telling lies.
Nobody's trying to trap you, Hannah.
You're here at Mr. Rankin's own request.
That's so, Hannah.
Now, isn't it true that...
Now, Rankin, you mustn't put words into her mouth.
- Now, Hannah, who was it you saw?
- I don't know.
- Was it Mr. Rankin?
- It was too dark to see properly.
He was more like a beast than a human being.
- Not a gentleman like Mr. Rankin.
- Thank you, Hannah.
- Hannah, I know you think you're trying to help me, but...
- Thank you, Hannah.
There you are, Rankin.
A girl who knows you well couldn't identify you.
But the knife...
I had it here in my hand.
- Did you show it to anyone?
- No. You sent for me to theJudas Hole before...
The Newgate turnkey.
He'll know me. He must.
He let me into the cemetery.
Very well, Rankin, if it'll humor you.
Yes.
Why, sir, this is the gentleman what visited you in the house of correction.
- All I need...
- I'll ask the questions.
Did you admit him to the prison again?
What reason would I have, sir?
A respectable gentleman...
I want a straight answer.
Yes or no.
- Never set eyes on him since, sir.
- Th... That's a lie!
You took me in the side gate.
You led me to the cemetery.
You should remember.
I paid you well enough.
Are you accusing this man of accepting bribes?
Sir...
I came to you with an unusual but perfectly reasonable request... and you refused it out of hand.
I had to find the knife to prove that Styles was innocent.
And I did find it!
How can you deny that you let me into the cemetery?
I'm sorry, sir. I'd help if I could.
Upon my soul, I would.
- Why, you lying dog!
- That'll do.
Steady, Rankin. Steady.
I ask you, sir, how could I get him into the cemetery without my mates knowing anything?
- Just ask them, sir.
- The grave.
The grave where I found the knife.
The earth is still fresh.
Lie as he will, he can't explain that away.
There you are, sir.
Fresh earth.
See for yourself, sir. jim Moxon, the child murderer.
We buried him last week.
- Now you're satisfed?
- It's a trick!
You changed the headstones.
This is Styles's grave, I tell you!
Governor, I demand another...
- Leave him to me. Steady, Rankin.
- Burk! He did let me in.
- I did find the grave.
- Rankin, steady.
- You must help me!
- Rankin, steady.
- I thought it was...
- I've asked Mr. Rankin to remain at the Yard.
- He's excited and not at all himself.
- After what Hannah told me, I'm not surprised.
That'll do, Miss Rankin. He's under the impression that he murdered your mother.
And that's only the beginning of it.
Naturally I don't believe this any more than you do.
- Has the doctor seen him?
- He's with Dr. Johnson now.
I want you to return with me. We must get him into a private home before anything else happens.
Obviously a case for observation.
- Coldbath Fields?
- No, there'd be diffculty about that... because, see, he's not actually a criminal lunatic.
Besides, it was the request of the daughter and the assistant that I examined him.
But an obsessional type... and dangerous.
I'd certainly prefer to have him under lock and key.
I'm just as sane as you are!
My daughter had no right! You can't commit me!
You speak as if I was suggesting some hole-in-the-corner abduction.
Naturally the certifcate will be signed by a justice of the peace.
Anything we do is purely for your own good.
You... You'll never get me!
You'll never put me in...
Get a van from Coldbath Fields.
And I must get a message to the superintendent.
I'm signing the order for commitment.
The man's a maniac.
No, no.
Take your hands off me.
You've got no right to...
Send for the inspector.
- Let him go!
- What's the meaning of this?
- Release this man immediately.
- Burk, you know me better than anybody.
You can vouch for me.
Put a stop to this.
- Here's the committal order, sir.
Properly signed by the justices.
- But this is ridiculous.
I'm afraid this paper's in order.
- I'm afraid Johnson's within his rights.
- Burk, you can't let them!
- You're not going to...
- If he goes, I go too!
Lily, it won't rest here.
You stood there and watched while they dragged him off to that terrible asylum.
- He attacked the surgeon!
- And what had they done to him before that?
Miss Rankin, this is not helping.
I'll get the commissioner to revoke the order, and we'll get him into a private home.
- Now you get down to Coldbath Fields and see what you can do.
- Right.
Come on. Time to eat.
No! No! I don't want it!
I don't want it! No!
- Company to see you.
- Burk?
- No, it's that doctor friend of yours.
- McColl. What does he want with me?
- Come on. We can't just stand talking.
- No! No! No!
Don't do it. Don't.
- You had no right to put him in here.
- You're seeing him on his best behavior.
Mr. Rankin, it's Kenneth McColl.
- I'm arranging to take you away.
- Why bother? You and Lily wanted me put here.
Mr. Rankin, if I'd known this was going to happen, I'd never have agreed.
You both wanted me out of the way!
You see? You're frightened.
I'm dangerous.
I did strangle those women.
Pearl, Martha Stuart.
Mr. Rankin!
McColl, I curse the day I ever saw you.
If I ever get my hands on you!
You'll not get away just by slamming this door!
Where's Burk?
Send for Burk!
I must have Burk!
He'll believe me!
I am Tenant, I tell you! I am!
I strangled those women!
I must prove it to you!
I'm glad you're here, sir.
As medical superintendent of this asylum...
I want you to authorize Mr. Rankin's transfer to a private home.
My dear sir, the man is a certifed criminal lunatic.
I admit he's unbalanced, but he's not a criminal.
He attacked me. If that's not a criminal assault, perhaps you can supply a name for it.
Mr. Rankin is a friend and a collaborator.
I know the stress he's been working under.
He's suffering from a violent psychic upheaval... possibly a projective identifcation with the murderer.
Without a proper examination,
I wouldn't like to put a name to it.
- Words, man. Words.
- You have to take the whole case history into consideration.
- With proper treatment...
- I don't agree.
I only know that the so-called treatment he's been getting here may do him lasting harm.
Do you think you can cure a diseased mind by... by brutality?
What are you doing?
Get your hands off!
Well, here are the papers.
I had an awful time getting the signature.
There wasn't as much diffculty putting him into the asylum.
- Dr. Johnson raised the objections.
- Admittedly there was provocation...
- But it's not right to put a man in Rankin's condition into a padded cell.
- No.
Anyway, thanks, Superintendent, for all you've done.
I take it you've made arrangements with a private home.
- Yes. I'm taking him straight from Coldbath Fields.
- Good.
I'll convince him that Lily bears him as much love as if she were his own daughter.
When Lily White Sand he heard the news
His eyes ran down with water
Said he
In love I'll constant prove
For I'll not live very long after
They both agreed to married be
Upon next Easter Sunday
But ratcatcher's daughter she had a dream
She'd not be alive on Monday
She went once more to buy some sprats
And tumbled into the water
And down to the bottom all covered in mud
Sank the ratcatcher's poor little daughter
- Have you seen him?
- Seen who?
- The escaped lunatic.
- Course I've seen him.
He's hiding under the spuds.
Want to look?
You can wipe that silly grin off your face.
He's put paid to poorJack Billins.
Spoiled his looks for life.
- Straight he has?
- We were right on him. He was coming this way.
Well, I ain't seen no one, and I've been here all the time.
He's not in there.
There's only potatoes in there.
Well, if you hear anything, holler.
Come on.
Holler? I'll scream bloody murder.
For I'll not live very long after
So he cut his
- What will they do to him?
- They'll catch him, of course.
I only hope they'll let him enter this private home.
Then perhaps, with treatment, he'll overcome this obsession.
They won't. They'll take him back to Coldbath Fields.
- It'll kill him.
- Darling, there's little we can do.
He thinks we're responsible for putting him there.
But we can't turn our backs on him, Ken.
No, darling, we can't.
We'll do everything in our power.
But as soon as it's over...
I'm going to take you to Canada.
- Have you found him?
- No, we haven't. The search parties are still out.
- Hunting him like some wild animal, I suppose.
- Miss Rankin, this is a matter of public safety.
If I'm right, he may return here. You and
Miss Rankin may be in very grave danger.
- Where's the maid?
- She'll be here soon.
You guard the front.
Keep an eye on the road.
- You, come round the back with me.
- Right, sir.
I'm convinced that knife's in this room somewhere.
But I don't understand. Why should he want to return here to kill us?
My dear, this is something beyond all our comprehension.
I had a talk with that injured attendant... and it seems evident that Rankin underwent some actual physical transformation.
- You speak as ifhe were possessed.
- I believe that he is.
You mean that somehow he released some evil spirit from the grave?
No, not that.
A side of himself he can't control.
A dual personality that, without the knife, is incomplete.
I can understand all that, but how do you account for this paralyzed arm?
It's a physical manifestation.
A sort of paralysis associated with what is going on in his mind.
I don't understand.
He was always so kind and gentle.
But your men searched this room.
It must be here somewhere.
Stay here. Don't move.
Hannah, what happened?
It was him.
Quick! Into the house!
Get out!
Forgive me, Lily.
Those faces, they haunt me.
I tried to kill you.
Mr. Rankin... you'll have to come with me.
Yes.
The knife.
It must go back to the grave.
I must put it there.
It's too late, Rankin.
I charge you.
- Bury this knife.
- Shoot.
Hold it!
I'll see the knife's destroyed, Rankin.
No use, Burk.
It belongs here... with me.
Sync and corrections by Dan
- Coffee.
- Be with you in a second.
- Mm, another raid, huh?
- Yeah.
'Eight ten, five and a half.
'Six fifteen, four sixteen...'
Come on. Let's go.
- Stick around, Soldier.
- Come on, let's get out of here.
Just a moment.
Tell Danny to take care of this.
OK, mister, here's your coffee.
Don't bother,
I've lost my appetite.
- Hey, Bobby.
- Oh, hi, Danny.
- Wanna do me a favour?
- Sure.
Take this over to Fran Garland at Sammy's café.
- OK.
- Hey!
Gee, thanks!
- Come on, Soldier.
- All right, Danny.
The administration boys must be taking the election seriously.
Barney said for you to call and take care of everything.
I don't know why they always have to wreck the joint.
Second time in three months.
Barney must be sending the pay-off money to his grandmother.
Place is closed.
Barney said to give you this.
Mr Vincent?
It's Dan Haley.
We just got raided again.
I thought that last $2,000 was the clincher.
Mr Vincent, you stink.
No, just Barney and Augie, and the least you can do is get down there with the bail.
Me? Just lucky.
And a happy Easter to you.
We're shut down for repairs.
Just wanted to see if my boys have overlooked anything.
- Who are you?
- Who are you?
- Captain Garvey, Vice Squad.
- I'm Dan Haley.
This is Soldier. Soldier was welter champion of the 19th division.
Haley, you run this?
I got a piece of it, penny ante stuff.
Yeah, well, you hustle yourself a sucker, huh?
I haven't seen one lately.
Unless it's me. I paid for protection, didn't you know?
Look him over, Philly.
He's clean, Captain.
Are you clean, Haley?
Immaculate.
How'd you get in on this set-up?
You don't look like a hoodlum.
Neither do you, Captain.
OK, Haley, we don't have a thing on you yet.
But I expect I'll be seeing you.
Maybe he's right at that - there's no future around here.
That's right, Danny.
This joint's washed up.
Remember Swede, the old middle-weight champ?
I get a Christmas card from him every year.
He was smart, saved up his dough.
Got a place in Las Vegas.
Everything's legal there.

- Go ahead. Happy Easter.
Oh, isn't it darling?
Nobody's given me anything like this since I was in the eighth grade.
I guess I'm not the type.
I'm sorry about the raid, Danny.
What are you gonna do?
Well, the boys are out on bail, but we're closed down.
If I had enough money, I'd move on.
This is a dead end.
I suppose that means we break up, too?
- Where would you go?
- I'd go someplace. Anyplace.
Another dead end?
You know, I can almost read your mind sometimes, Danny.
Especially when you get that kind of funny look in your eye.
What are you looking for, Danny?
I'm not looking for anything.
- You just wanna be left alone?
- That's right.
Don't you ever get tired of being left alone?
No.
What kind of a girl was she?
The girl who took you over the jumps.
I knew there was one, I can tell.
What do you want me to say?
You could just say, "Fran, I love you."
Just once you could say it.
I told you from the beginning
I didn't want to get involved, Fran.
Danny, you can't live without getting involved.
I can try, can't I?
Saul's getting impatient.
That last number sounded OK when I came in.
We're a great pair.
I have no voice and you have no ear.
Thanks, Danny.
Take it from the beginning, Saul.
Let's knock 'em dead.
Don't knock, just tap a little, and try and keep that tune in your head.
If I had a head, I wouldn't be doing a lot of things I'm doing.

That ought to hold now.
It's a lot better with a chain.
- Give us more time.
- To do what? Jump out the window?
Hey Barney, you know what the doc said - you start that again, you'd split your gut wide open.
All right, Soldier, I won't touch it.
Come on, Danny, sit in for a couple of hands.
No percentage - playing cards with you two is like washing your feet with your socks on.
It'd kill some time.
He'd rather play with that dame down the street.
He's a music lover.
- It's time, Soldier.
- Never mind!
I'll get it, Punchy.
My name ain't "Punchy".
Well, it ought to be.
You're about the punchiest...
Shut up, Augie.
Why did I have to get ulcers?
The way we've been getting raided, it's a wonder we haven't all got them.
That's interesting coming from a little man who wasn't there.
- There's your medicine, boss.
- Thanks, Augie.
I have to drink it slow. The doctor says it puts a coat on my stomach.
Sure, sure, makes a good coat.
Look what I did.
Hey, there's a hole in it!
Party Fun, "Hole in One".
And you fell for it. Boy, are you a mess!

Cut it out, Augie!

Sure! He's got a nice thing down there.

You should've tasted the scotch they gave us in England. That was the real stuff.
Boy, they gave us everything.
Couldn't do too much for us then.
- I'll have another.
- Make me one too, George.
- How about letting me buy you one?
- Thanks.
This gentleman is from the air forces,
Mr Haley.
Defended England during the war.
Did a good job.
England's still there.
Ah, there'll always be an England.
- Hey, what is this, a rib?
- No.
George was a gunner in England.
I was with the 79th Bombardment at Steeple Norton.
Yeah? I was with the 364th
Fighter Group at Huntington.
I knew some of the guys in the 364th.
What's your name?
Winant. Arthur Winant.
1st Lieutenant.
What squadron were you in?
Well, I... I wasn't a pilot, really.
I was a special service officer.
Same war.
I guess maybe I was shooting my mouth off a little too much.
♪ Did I say, "I love you"?

Say, Danny,
Fran's been killing 'em tonight.
Is she your gal?
It's a free world. We go out.
I was just thinking, if she wasn't,
I'd sure like to meet her.
We could probably arrange it.
Where are you from?
- Los Angeles.
- What do you do?
Oh, about the same thing as in the Army.
I'm an athletic vendor for a club in L.A.
I came east to buy some athletic equipment.
I got a brother flying in from Montreal tomorrow night. He's gonna help me.
- Here you are. Keep the change.
- Thank you.
Hello.
Miss Garland, this is Mr Winant of Los Angeles, late of the Army's special services.
- How do you do?
- How do you do?
I enjoyed your singing very much,
Miss Garland - really terrific.
- Thank you very much.
- You have quite an admirer in Mr Winant.
You certainly have.
I, er... was just wondering,
Miss Garland...
Pardon me for interrupting you two, but I'll have to be running along.
- Got a little game of cards.
- A game? But I thought...
Private game.
Why don't you come up after the show tonight?
Anything you say, Danny.
See you around.
Keep 'em flying.
Oh, er, Mr Haley...
- Place far from here?
- Just around the corner. Why?
I was just thinking, er... if the game isn't too steep,
I wouldn't mind losing a couple of bucks.
You'd be in pretty rough company.
I've been in rough company before.
Usually hold my own.
I'm glad to hear it.
OK, you're over 21.
All right.
See you later, Miss Garland.
Let me take that, Lieutenant,
I'll hang it up for you.
Thanks.
What do you say, we start with $50 each?
- Fine with me.
- Cut for deal?
Oh, er... no offence, fellas, but what do you say one of you sits out the game and deals?
That way I only have to watch one dealer instead of three.
No objection.
OK, I think I'll pick my friend here.
You're a pretty cagey player.
Well, after all I don't know you fellas, you're strangers.
And this isn't exactly the first game
I've ever played in.
My brother taught me quite a bit about poker.
Your brother must be quite a guy.
Yeah, he is.
Let's make it interesting.
Oh, er... before I forget it, er...
Do you mind if we slot a two o'clock deadline? Got a big day tomorrow.
Yep, Sidney's quite a guy.
I used to go on fishing trips with him.
Then he let me carry his fish home and say they were mine.
Some brother!
Yep!
I remember one time
I ran into a guy with my bike.
I was about eight years old then.
The guy slapped me, and I told my brother about it.
The next day
I pointed the guy out to him.
Now, at the time, Sidney was only 17, and the guy was full-grown.
But let me tell you,
Sidney almost killed him.
They held him in custody until they were sure the guy was gonna live.
Some brother!
Hello, Miss Garland!
- I guess you're good luck for me, huh?
- Always glad to be of service.
He's won almost every hand the last three hours.
It's getting late, isn't it?
I'm sure it's past two o'clock.
That's our deadline.
Give us a chance to get even.
You're 120 bucks into me.
He's over 60 into me.
Last hand.
All right. Let's make it twenty.
Two.
I'll take two.
I'll take two cards.
All right. Twenty more.
I'll see you and raise you twenty.
He's too lucky for me.
Call you.
Beat two pair.
- I thought you were bluffing.
- You can't do it.
OK.
Check me out.
All right.
That makes $325.
- Here's your coat, Lieutenant.
- Thanks.
Oh.
Buy yourself a cigar.
I hope you won't be offended, but, er... you know it's considered bad luck not to take care of the dealer.
Thank you very much.
Hey, er...
How about giving us a chance to get even?
Well, it's a little late right now, but what about tomorrow night?
- OK.
- About seven?
Fine. Er, Miss Garland...
Would you have dinner with me tomorrow night before the game?
- I'll have to think about it.
- All right.
First he takes all our dough, now he wants to take Danny's girl.
I guess that's what they mean by "special service".
- All right, I'll see you at the club, then.
- You sure you won't forget about the game?
Oh, no, I'll be here.
I gotta pick up my brother at the airport, so I have to quit 11:30, win or lose.
Win or lose - it's all the same to us, as long as we're having a good time.
Sure, that's all that matters - having a good time.
Well, good night, all.
Good night.
Soldier, my cream.
In the bottle.
Suppose he don't come back.
- We're out all the dough we got in the world.
- He'll come back.
Won't he, Danny?
Yeah, he'll come back.
Come on, I'll take you home.
I hope he doesn't show up.
He will. That kind of sucker always shows up.
What's worth such an elaborate set-up?
A $5,000 cashier's cheque.
Poor guy!
He took our money.
He was willing to win from us.
This set-up, it's dog eat dog.
I had to learn it the hard way.
I didn't get it in one easy lesson.
- Does that go for puppies, too?
- Record or Journal?
Both.
- No, keep it.
- Thanks.
Don't you wanna know what's going on in the world?
What's going on in the world stinks.
With your share of the $5,000 you'll leave, won't you?
You're going to walk out.
I don't know.
I think you know, Danny.
- I don't like to be needled this way, Fran.
- There are a lot of things I don't like either.
I don't like working in that place.
I don't like guys looking at me the way they do.
I don't like any part of this.
But I have to take it because I have to live.
What's your excuse, Danny?
I'm tired of talking and getting no answers.
I'm tired of making believe that everything's just fine between us.
I don't like it this way.
I don't want it this way.
There's no other way, Fran.
I thought that was understood.
Sure it was understood - you understood it, I didn't.
Everything for you, nothing for me.
I'm in the same boat with that dope Arthur.
Make it ten.
I'll call.
Three kings.
That's tough.
I've got a full house.
Gee!
I've, er... I haven't won a hand in over an hour.
You've just hit a bad streak.
Maybe he needs Fran around to bring him luck.
- She stood me up at dinner tonight.
- Never trust a woman, Arthur.
That's the way luck goes.
Bad for a while, all of a sudden it'll get good.
Twenty.
I'm out.
I'll take two.
Check to you.
- Twenty.
- I'll call.
- Two pair.
- Not good enough.
Well, that cleans me.
That's too bad. It's still so early.
If you wanna go on with the game, Arthur,
I could let you have $100.
No, thanks.
If I lost, how would I pay you back?
Who wouldn't lend money to a guy who's got a cheque for $5,000 in his pocket?
Hey, now, wait a minute!
Not that cheque, it's not mine.
I wouldn't use it no matter what happened. Thanks.
What time is it anyway?
Ten o'clock.
You still got a couple of hours to kill.
Yeah, and I got a feeling
I can still take you guys.
Danny, I'll take that $100.
Look, er...
This really isn't my money.
It belongs to the club.
What's the matter, Augie, couldn't you play it on the level?
Isn't the house percentage good enough for you?
What's your beef?
We got his dough, didn't we?
Danny, was the game on the level?
A guy like that cheats himself just by sitting down.
I'm sorry I got mad the other night.
It doesn't matter.
Everybody gets mad sometimes.
- Now that you've got your money...
- I haven't got it yet.
Barney thought he ought to clear the cheque through a friend of his.
When you do, you'll be leaving.
I'm not sure
I feel like going anywhere now.
Oh, Danny...
Don't close in on me anymore, Fran.
That's all.
- I won't.
- Good.
Hey, son. Let me have one.
Maybe we can catch a movie.
Danny! Danny!
- It says...
- Says what?
"Arthur Winant, identified as a resident of Los Angeles,
"hanged himself last night in his room at the Wellington Hotel.
"The body was discovered by the dead man's brother."
Yellow jerk, knocking himself off.
You shouldn't have brought him here.
Or maybe you shouldn't have crimped the cards.
You shouldn't have done it.
You shouldn't have cheated the Lieutenant.
- What's the matter with you?
- Let him alone, Augie!
I don't like him around here.
That dumb look on his puss all the time!
Guys like you ought to be put away.
Well, there's nothing we can do about the cheque now.
If they track it down, they'll say we forced him to sign it. I don't like it.
I don't care what you don't like.
I want my dough.
I talked to our lawyer, and he said not to cash it.
- This could be a tough wrap.
- Give me that cheque!
Barney's right!
The cheque's got dynamite in it now.
Maybe a little later we'll see what we can do about it.
This whole thing gives me the creeps.
All day long I've had the feeling
I was being followed.
What are you waiting for, Punchy?
Answer it.
Hello?
Yeah.
1752 Meredith Street, room 207.
- Who was that?
- I don't know. He didn't give no name.
- You told him the address.
- What did you do that for?
Because I was hoping it was the cops, cos I wish somebody'd come down and kill the whole murdering lot of you.
- Relax, jerk.
- The Lieutenant was a good guy.
- You didn't have no right to cheat him.
- Soldier, look...
You're worse than the rest of them, Danny.
They don't know no better.
You're worse than all of them.
- Who is it?
- Fran.
I've been calling all evening.
Did you just get in?
No, I've been here.
Why didn't you answer the phone?
There was nobody I wanted to talk to.
You want me to go?
No.
I know you feel bad, Danny.
I feel fine.
I'm glad you're here.
Are you?
Sure I'm glad.
- How long can you stay?
- An hour.
I go on again in an hour.
Hey...
That hurt.
You're a million miles away, Danny.
I don't know where I am.
You're here with me.
Yeah, OK, Fran. Yeah, OK.
Let it ring.
Maybe it's important.
What's important?
I don't know what's important to you.
Don't you ever need anybody, Danny?
- What for?
- Just to need.
Stop ringing!
Hello?
What do you want, Barney?
Danny, I couldn't sleep.
I feel awful.
My stomach is churning like a washing machine.
'Take your pills, Barney.'
Danny, you wouldn't come over?
Maybe it's just nerves, but... like I told you today,
I felt I was being followed.
It was the same thing tonight, all the way home.
- I'm tired. Call Augie.
- 'I tried. He's not home.'
Danny, I've got the shakes.
I thought I heard someone on the fire escape.
Go and look. You've got a gun.
'Not since the raid. You've got it.'
Look, Barney, you're imagining things.
Now take your pills and go to sleep.
'And don't call me anymore.
I'll see you tomorrow.'
If you'd just come over for...
Danny!
Did you lock that door?
- Oh, hello, Barney.
- You're late getting home, aren't you?
- Since when does that interest you?
- I just felt lonesome.
There wasn't anybody outside when you came in, was there?
Say, are you all right?
- What's the matter with you?
- You haven't got a drink, have you?
Any kind of a drink.
Your ulcers must have taken a turn for the better.
And don't forget the loan.
- You wouldn't let me come in?
- Good night, Barney.
Sit down, boys.
That's all, Sergeant.
Well, Haley, I didn't think we'd meet again soon.
Neither did I.
They transferred me to Homicide for this case because they knew that you and I were old friends.
Well, boys, how'd he look to you?
Same old Barney.
Yeah, that's how I always look at corpses, with my eyes closed.
D'you know any reason why Barney'd wanna hang himself?
No.
I mean, was he being threatened by anyone?
Did he owe any money?
He was sick.
He was always worrying about it.
The autopsy showed that he had one small bleeding ulcer.
Not enough for him to hang himself.
You see, the point is, he didn't.
The facts are, he died from strangulation, not from hanging.
When he was found, there was a small welt on his neck from this.
Right here.
And there was another welt a little lower down, right smack across his Adam's apple.
Somebody snapped this rope around his neck from behind, choked the life out of him and then strung him up.
Pretty?
Well, Augie, your alibi holds up.
You were at a crap game last night.
Are we under arrest?
No.
No, guys like you seldom get arrested.
You get killed first.
You still don't figure in this racket.
Your alibi looks pretty good, too.
This, er... This girl, er, Fran Garland swears that she was with you at the time of the murder.
Who do you think did it?
In the business Barney was in you make a lot of enemies.
Could've been any crank disappointed over a two-buck bet.
- That how you feel about it?
- Sure.
What about this ex-pug works over at your joint?
Soldier?
He couldn't have done it.
That guy couldn't last one round with Barney's ulcer.
Anyway, Barney's been feeding him for years. He loved Barney.
Augie...
You've been up three times.
And Haley, we don't have a thing on you yet, but, er, we get your fingerprints and your right name.
You got my right name.
It's funny how things happen.
Thirty-six hours ago, this young fellow from Los Angeles blew into town, and - you must've read about it - was taken to some gamblers.
He signed over a $5,000 cashier's cheque, money that wasn't his.
The he goes back to his hotel, he gets up on a chair with a rope around his neck, ties the rope around the chandelier and kicks the chair out from under him.
Twenty-four hours later, a gambler's found hanging.
Does that ring a bell?
It's a big city.
It's a dirty mess.
Mrs Winant is flying in from Los Angeles.
We expect her any minute.
- Cos he left a kid, too.
- Tough.
It's kind of a peculiar case.
A brother found the body and called the police.
Kept screaming that the guys who fleeced Arthur were guilty of murder.
Sounded like a nut.
The police went to the hotel, and... found the body all right, but no brother.
There was an open envelope addressed to Sidney Winant.
But there was no note and no Sidney Winant.
He just disappeared.
Tough.
No connection between Barney and Arthur Winant?
Never heard of him.
Yes?
'Mrs Winant is here, Captain.'
Bring her in.
That's all, boys.
Don't worry,
I'll get in touch with you.
Follow me, please.
- All right, you. Let's go.
- We've got names.
Yeah? How many?
Looks like the brother got Barney.
- I sure feel like a drink.
- So do I.
- Soft.
- Are you kidding?
Come on.
His brother Sidney must've been the guy that called Soldier and got the address.
Must've waited outside and seen Barney.
Barney thought he was being followed.
He saw all of us, then.
He knows who to look for.
I'd like to find that guy and talk to him.
Maybe he'll find you and he won't talk.
He doesn't sound like a guy that likes to talk.
Think he's still around?
He did it. Barney was just the start.
He sure is still around.
He came down from Canada, didn't he?
- Maybe he went back.
- Maybe.
- I'm spilling it all over here.
- Just like Barney.
Hey, look.
I bet she's gonna meet that brother.
Come on.
Well, it makes sense, don't it?
What are we gonna do, just sit here like a couple of pigeons?
If we follow her, we'll really be pigeons, all lined up for Garvey.
- Don't you know he's got us spotted?
- Since when did you start running things?
Look, Augie, I don't like you any more than you like me.
As a matter of fact, I hate your guts, but as long as someone's trying to kill us both, we're forced into partnership.
Unless you've got a better idea, we'll have to stick together.
Is that clear?

I thought you'd left.
I got worried.
I just wanted a breath of air.
Let's take a walk by the river and cool off.
I'd love to, Danny.
I wonder where it's going.
- Across the Styx.
- What?
In Greek mythology, the Styx was the river over which the souls of the dead were carried.
Also, even more appropriately, called "the river of the underworld".
I don't know what you're talking about.
But it doesn't matter.
I love you, Danny.
Why don't you tell Garvey about Arthur Winant?
Because the heat's on Garvey.
He's got to pin these hangings on someone.
It won't be me.
I know what I'm doing, Fran.
Please, let's not fight.
You need me almost as much as I need you, Danny.
I know I could make you happy.
Fran, look, you're a nice kid, but it wouldn't work out.
That's the way it is.
Is there somebody else?
No.
But there was.
And you wanted to marry her.
I did marry her.
And the next thing you knew, she'd run off with some other guy.
So now you won't even let yourself be human.
A girl walked out on you, and you couldn't take it.
But you take it out on me.
Now you think every girl's a tramp that...
Come on,
I'll take you back to Sammy's.
I'm sorry, there's no answer in Miss Miles' room.
May I take a message?
Thank you.
Can I have my key, please?
- What number, please?
- 224, Dan Haley.
I'm sorry, Mr Haley, this is my first night here.
It's not here.
Oh, I remember, I gave the key to 224 to a gentleman just a few minutes ago.
You gave out my key?
I was taking a call at the time, and this man just asked for the room number.
I'm terribly sorry.
- Shall I call the police?
- No.
I have an idea who it is, a friend of mine.
- I'll get a duplicate key.
- No...
There's a vacant room next to mine, isn't there? 225.
- That's right.
- Let me have the key to that.
And to the connecting door.
I want to surprise my friend.
We can forget your mistake.
- Thanks.
- That's all right, Mr Haley.
Augie.
I just dropped by to see what was doing.
I couldn't find Soldier.
The guy at the desk said you were out.
I thought I'd wait for you.
We're... We're in this together, Danny.
I sat around in the lobby...
I don't know, hours, I guess.
I saw a lot of funny-looking characters, and it made me kind of jumpy.
There's a new guy at the desk.
I figured if I could get the key,
I could wait for you in the room.
- With a gun!
- I didn't figure he'd ring.
Look what happened to Barney.
You're gonna be a great help! I'd better hang a bell on you, so I know where you are.
You don't have to get tough.
- You know what, Augie?
- What?
You're yellow.
I never saw you pick on anybody that wasn't old or sick.
This is no time for us to get in an argument.
Yeah, I know.
Get out, Augie.
Keep that gun in your pocket.
OK.
Soldier doesn't worry you, huh?
Soldier?
These guys just go nuts from punches in the head. You never know with them.
You never know with anybody, Augie.
I'll relieve your mind, Haley.
That, er... That was just Lt Jackson of the Homicide squad taking Mrs Winant's train.
We try to show courtesy to out-of-towners.
Come to think of it, this is the scene of the crime, isn't it?
It's one of them, anyway.
Now, you ought to be more careful.
You know there's an old saying about murderers returning to the scene of the crime.
Yours must be a fascinating business,
Captain.
I want to see you at headquarters in the morning, nine o'clock.
Nine o'clock sharp!
I asked you to come in, Haley, because we got a very interesting letter from the Adjutant General's office about you.
"Daniel H. Haley."
So that is your right name.
"Captain, US Army Air Corps."
You were court-martialled in England in 1943 for killing a man.
I was acquitted.
But even after the acquittal, you just couldn't keep out of trouble.
You were frequently unmanageable and drunk on duty.
You killed an officer from your own squadron. Why?
You have the letter.
It's all there.
In a fight over your wife.
Should also say it was my best friend.
Is that why you started hitting the bottle?
You know, a lot of your best friends die,
Haley, that's what interests me about you.
Where's your wife now?
She was English.
I suppose she's still in England.
I wish she were in...
- Are you divorced?
- Yeah.
You know, you never went home again after you returned to the States.
Why was that?
Do you have a bad transcript, Captain, or do you just enjoy the sound of my voice?
Your father was a West Point man, he wouldn't forgive the scandal.
I can see how you got to be a detective.
Cornell, 1937-41.
I'm sure with those references you had no trouble at all getting work in a bookie joint.
What did you do after college?
Sold insurance for a while.
Then the war came along, and my father got his wish - I signed up to be a hero.
Yes, according to the record, you did all right in that field.
That's the only reason you got off so light in the court-martial.
That was a long time ago, Captain.
Not so long ago.
And Barney's death was quite recent.
How'd you think you're gonna get it?
With your protection,
I feel perfectly safe.
This is not for laughs.
I get paid to protect people.
I don't have to like 'em, just protect them.
Now, Mrs Winant gave us some very interesting information about Sidney Winant.
There was an unfortunate relationship with his younger brother.
Sidney completely dominated him.
Protected the kid, and yet he'd demand that he be best in everything he did.
It was kind of a father complex.
He's gonna kill you unless we can stop him.
I don't plan to get killed, Captain.
What do you plan to do?
Stay out of trouble, keep out of his way.
Did you ever see a sheep in a slaughterhouse?
He's scared, panicked.
The smell of death frightens him.
He knows there's danger, but he can't tell what it is.
So he huddles with the rest of the flock, moving when they move.
He's a good little sheep, just keeping out of trouble, keeping out of the way.
Suddenly a gate opens, and it's a way out.
He's running down a long passage, because to the sheep, it looks like the way to freedom, but there's a man with a sledgehammer waiting at the end.
You may get an opportunity to learn how that sheep feels, because there's still no trace of Sidney Winant.
We, er... We had a letter from him that was saying that justice would be done if the police didn't interfere.
I got sixteen men out now trying to track him down because he's a homicidal case with one up and two to go.
And you and Augie are Sidney Winant's unfinished business, and unless we get him first, he's gonna get you just as sure as he got Barney.
I hope you find him.
You'd better hope.
What happened to that cheque, Danny?
Look, Captain, my present crime is dealing cards in a bookie joint.
Is that what I'm being questioned about?
I'm so sick of seeing you guys come in here, one after the other, I wanna throw up.
Every one a carbon copy of the one before.
Every one going to shake the world till it hollers uncle, not caring who gets hurt along the way, and every one ending up just like Barney.
Those are the kids out of the slums, out of the gutter.
They got two strikes against them before they steal their first apple.
But you've got no excuse for being here.
You killed a man. Why, I don't know, it's got nothing to do with this case.
But unless you get hold of yourself, you're going to end up like all the rest of them.
One day, you're going to lose that smile, Danny.
One day, you're going to hit bottom and break every bone in your body.
And when that happens, you'll be like all the rest of them.
You won't have the guts to do anything but lie there.
Now get out of here.
And get out of town fast.

No Soldier, no Sidney Winant, nothing.
- Bourbon. Double.
- Fine.
We got this guy on our tail, we don't even know what he looks like.
Anyone you met in this room might be Sidney Winant.
He know that, and he can see us - wherever we are, whatever we do.
We can't see him. It's like being followed by an invisible man.
I'll give him the cheque back and get him to lay off.
You can't reason with a man you can't find.
That's why Garvey wants us out of town.
He doesn't want another killing on his hands.
He's got a good point.
But I think I got a better one.
What?
This fellow Winant comes from Los Angeles.
Maybe somebody in his hometown knows where his brother is.
We can find him before he finds us.
- We can knock him off first.
- If we have to.
We'll go in separate planes.
I'll take the ten o'clock flight, and you come on a later one.
We'll meet at the Union Station in Los Angeles, noon Friday.
- And then what?
- I'll try and see Mrs Winant.
- The widow?
- Yeah.
You try to get a lead on Sidney.
You've looked up people before, haven't you?
Yeah. And I found them.
What about the cheque? I don't like us splitting up when you still got it.
If anything goes wrong,
I won't be hard to find.
No. I guess you wouldn't.

- What did you find out?
- Nothing. Nobody seems to know him.
Automobile Club, YMCA, a lot of places.
Nothing in any of them.
Everybody that knows Arthur clams up when you mention the brother.
- You know what I think?
- All the time, Augie.
OK, OK, but we're not getting anyplace here.
Look, the cheque's good.
It's got the jerk's signature on it, hasn't it?
It's just the two of us now, so we split fifty-fifty.
- I don't wanna look for this guy no more.
- We'll try it for a week.
We ought to be able to find a picture of him somewhere - a high school yearbook, someplace.
We can't afford not to try.
Remember what happened to Barney.
If we don't find him in a week, we cash the cheque and take our chances.
OK.
- Hello.
- Hi there.
Is this the Winant house?
Yep, but there's nobody home.
I'm watching the house.
I guess it must be pretty safe then.
- You want to see Mommy?
- That's right.
My mommy's shopping.
- What's your name?
- Mr Branton.
I'm Billy.
This looks like a pretty strong swing you've got here, Billy.
- It is. My daddy made it.
- He did?
There's Mommy.
- Mommy!
- Billy!
- Hello, Mommy.
- Let me help you.
How do you do, Mrs Winant?
I'm Richard Branton of the Empire Insurance Company.
I'm their investigator for this territory.
I tried calling you several times on the phone, but there was no answer.
Well, since you have the packages, won't you come in?
I'm hungry, Mommy.
When aren't you?
He's quite a boy.
Well, I think so.
Let me take your package.
Thank you.
- Now, Mr...
- Branton.
Mr Branton.
I've never heard my husband mention anything about having a policy with the Empire Insurance Company.
Well, the policy was taken out on him by Sidney Winant.
According to the report, he's your husband's brother.
He's the beneficiary, but my company's been unable to locate him, and we felt perhaps you could help us.
You're the next beneficiary, and...
I haven't heard from him in some time.
Well, you must have some idea where he is.
Your husband went east to meet him.
I had no idea that Arthur was planning...
I'm afraid I can't help you, Mr Branton.
But he must have some friends,
Mrs Winant.
- Could you give me the names of...
- No, Mr Branton, I can't. I'm sorry.
I've been through quite a bit recently.
The police back east asked me so many questions.
They're looking for Sidney, too.
They think he killed one of the men who robbed Arthur.
Robbed him?
Yes, robbed him.
Tricked him into playing cards.
Cheated him and robbed him of money that wasn't his.
Robbed him of his self-respect.
And made him take his life.
He didn't have to play, and... when he lost, he didn't have to kill himself.
If you did know Arthur, you wouldn't say that.
How can I be sure that you are who you say you are, Mr Branton?
How can I be sure that...
Please, I wish you'd go now.
I know how you feel, Mrs Winant.
If you should change your mind,
I'll be at the Wilshire Plaza for a few days.
Mr Branton...
Would my... Would my son and I have to be involved?
You wouldn't be involved at all,
Mrs Winant.
It's simply a matter of establishing identification.
Thank you.
- What is it you need?
- Any kind of a clue at all.
Letters or photographs.
My company is especially interested in getting a picture of Sidney Winant as proof of identity.
Well, we still have a lot of things stored at the Careys' where we used to live.
- There might be some photographs there.
- Could we go there now?
Well, it's a little late.
I have to prepare dinner.
Could you be back here at noon tomorrow?
All right.
Noon tomorrow, then.
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.
- Who is it?
- Danny.
Where were you?
I waited in that drugstore till ten o'clock.
I thought something had happened.
It did.
- I don't feel good.
- Give me that.
- What did you do that for?
- Shut up!
If I catch you with a bottle again,
I'll break it over your head.
- Did you find out anything?
- No, I didn't.
I think I talked to one guy too many.
An old friend of Sidney's.
He kind of gave me the fish eye.
I think he knows where Sidney is.
I think he'll tell him.
I hope he does.
By tomorrow, we'll be ready for him.
Not me.
I'm getting out of here.
First big city I come to,
I'm gonna cash that cheque.
Don't make me laugh.
Give it to me!
You listen to me, you stupid jerk!
That's the last time you ever pull a gun on me.
I said a week, and I meant it.
You'll do just what I tell you to do.
Please, you have to stop that noise in there.
You're waking everybody up.
All right, Augie, you don't have to do anything. Just sit there.
You'll scare yourself to death.
If I want you,
I'll get in touch with you.
If you want to do any more fighting, mister, go someplace else.
We got a respectable trade here.
What's this?
"Away for a few days - check me Monday. Mrs Carey."
Oh, no!
Oh, I'm terribly sorry about this.
I hope this won't upset your plans too much.
Well, it does leave me with a lot of time on my hands.
Yes.
I suppose I could do some sightseeing.
Oh, yes, there are lots of things to see.
Griffith Park, the Planetarium, Ocean Park.
Olvera Street is charming!
Well, I'm not much of a sightseer.
Unless I have company.
Well, I...
I have to pick up Billy at school
Children love me almost as much as dogs do.
You know, Mr Branton, since the moment I saw you,
I've had the feeling that I'd seen you before.
And maybe you have.
I've been lots of places.
What about it, Mrs Winant?
Well, since I got you here under false pretences, I...
I suppose I'm really responsible for you.
Fine, get in.
There he is! Hi!
- Oh, boy! Ice cream!
- Ice cream.
- What about you?
- No, no.
Oh, sure. Come in.
Nice, big smile, please.
Hold it!
- OK, darling. Go on.
- My picture.
Thanks, Mr Branton.
I had a neat time.
That's all right, Billy.
Maybe we'll do it again sometime.
I should thank you, too, for being so patient and so sweet to Billy.
I enjoyed it.
Well, I'll keep after the Careys.
Perhaps when I get the pictures, you would like to come out for dinner.
I'd like it a lot. You wouldn't consider making it tonight, would you?
Well, I... I haven't been going out.
To someplace quiet, and maybe we could go for a drive.
I am a stranger.
All right, give me an hour, huh?
The star Altair is just rising above the celestial horizon there to the east.
That point of light we see in the evening sky, travelling 186,000 miles per second, left Altair sixteen years ago.
And so the Griffith Planetarium concludes this section of tonight's demonstration
"The Stars of Spring".
Now, while the music plays, we will watch the stars pursue their course through one more night.
You know...
You forget how beautiful things can be.
It is beautiful.
Like the sky in Italy, the Riviera...
It's like a lot of things.
It's different, too.
You've been a lot of places for an insurance salesman.
You're a pretty unusual person yourself for a Los Angeles housewife.
Well, I...
I don't think things ever turn out quite the way we plan them.
Were you living here in Los Angeles when you married him?
No.
Arthur was headed overseas when I met him in New York.
I was working for the International Red Cross.
We were married after only a few weeks.
And Billy was three years old when Arthur came back.
It was really unfair to expect he'd be the way that I remembered him.
Arthur was a very understanding person.
Most war romances needed a lot of understanding.
Well...
It wasn't just the uniform.
People really are different during the war.
I guess the stars are the only things that never change.
That's only because we can't reach them.
Sometimes we think we can.
I'll check this last stack.
There won't be any pictures of Sidney in there, Mrs Winant.
Because you don't have any pictures of him.
No, it's true.
I destroyed them.
- You did what?
- I destroyed them.
But why?
Not because of the insurance.
For Billy's sake.
I've been afraid.
I've been afraid that... that Sidney might do something to Billy.
That he might take Billy away from me.
If I had the money, I would...
I would take Billy away from here.
I would...
I would go back home to Europe.
Where we'd be safe.
I hope he's dead.
Why are you afraid of Sidney?
Because he's psychopathic.
He's what?
He was confined in an institution for years.
Why haven't you told me this?
I didn't trust you then.
Anyhow, I didn't think you'd keep on insisting.
I destroyed all the pictures I had of him.
I didn't want my son to be brought up knowing that his uncle was insane.
I didn't want anyone to know.
And I am afraid.
Sidney was always jealous of me.
There's no way of knowing what he'll do.
Yet I... I can't feel sorry for him taking revenge on those men.
'Hiya, Billy.
'I just got in this morning and saw this recording place.
'Billy, I'm homesick already.
'I'd sure like to be back home with you and your mommy right now.
'Er, Billy, will you do me a favour?
'Will you kiss her for me?
And, er...
'Oh, the signal! My time is up.
'My time is up.
My time is up. My time is up.
'My time is up.'
You play it too often, Billy.
It's getting worn out.
Say good night to Mr Branton now.
It's past your bedtime.
- Good night, Mr Branton.
- Good night, Billy.
Back in a minute.
It was one of those
"send your greetings home" records.
I got it the next morning.
Are you still in love with him?
No, I... I don't think I ever was.
When Arthur came back from the war, we were strangers.
Do you have to sell this place?
Well, I still have two mortgages on it.
It was hard enough to manage when Arthur was alive.
Well, don't be in too much of a hurry.
I mean, you've had nothing but bad breaks, maybe you're ready for a good one.
- What do you mean?
- The policy.
I'm leaving for Las Vegas on another matter.
Then I'm going back to Chicago.
If we haven't been able to find Sidney Winant by then, the money goes to you.
I expect $10,000 would help.
It would take care of everything.
Well...
I'll call you before I leave.
Look, Victoria...
I have to tell you something.
My name isn't Branton. It's...
It's Dan Haley.
I'm one of the gamblers who played cards with your husband.
I remember now.
I saw you in Captain Garvey's office.
Sidney was determined to kill everyone who had anything to do with it.
He's got one of us already.
I came here to find him before he found me.
Get out, please.
- I thought the game was legitimate.
- Legitimate!
Arthur playing opposite three professional gamblers.
The way you used me to save your own skin was bad enough, but to come here and make friends with Billy after murdering his father!
Mr Branton, you didn't forget about the movies tomorrow?
Billy, you'd better go back to bed.
Mr Branton is leaving.
At least the club will get its money back.
I'm sorry.
Augie!
Augie?
OK, take him down.
Yeah, that's him all right.
The way they was fighting the other night,
I thought he was going to kill him then.
Hello, Danny.
Well...
- This is a pleasant surprise.
- Still the same case.
Come on, we're gonna take a little walk.
Er, get your coat.
I didn't do it, Garvey.
That's what I've been trying to tell 'em.
I think you would like to, but I don't think you did.
You came out here to find Sidney Winant, but he found you first, huh?
At least he found Augie first.
Well, Danny, all the things we talked about kinda coming true, aren't they?
You're getting closer to the bottom all the time.
I won't be alone.
That's where you're wrong, Danny.
You are alone.
And when a guy like you dies, he dies alone.
Come in.
This is Captain MacDonald,
Chief of Homicide.
We're letting you go, Haley, but don't come back here because you're an undesirable, and we don't want any more killings.
Look, you're only postponing the inevitable.
Sidney will follow me wherever I go.
The only chance is to stay here and bring him out in the open.
Well, you'll either have to get out of town or else stay in jail.
- Where are you sending me?
- Where do you want to go?
Erm...
- Las Vegas.
- Las Vegas?
I got some unfinished business there.
Taxi!
- Soldier!
- Danny!
- You look great!
- Sure, I feel like a preliminary boy.
What are you doing here?
I remember you used to talk about Swede all the time.
Yeah, I... I came here right after it happened.
I've been working for Swede ever since.
I read about Barney.
Was it the Lieutenant's brother who did it?
Yeah, he's crazy, Soldier.
Augie's dead, too.
I'm not sorry to hear it.
- Hey, what about...
- ...me? I'm OK, but I'm broke.
I got some dough, Danny.
Thanks a lot, Soldier, but I'd rather have a job.
I'll introduce you to Swede.
He's a swell guy.
Gee, it's good to see you, Danny.
- How's Fran?
- I wouldn't know.
Oh, I thought you two would get together.
You think you could put in a good word for me with Swede?
Lots of 'em, Danny, lots of 'em.
Good luck, folks.
Three winners and three losers.
Always looking for something, Danny.
What do you want, more customers?
Aren't you satisfied?
I've played here every night this week and never won yet.
Hit me.
You see? Broke.
Well, you did pretty well this week.
Hope you're planning on sticking around for a while.
Do you suppose you could let me have an advance, say a couple of hundred?
Sure.
I don't suppose you care what I do with my nights off.
No.
What are you gonna do? Take it over to one of the big places and blow it in?
I hope I don't blow it in.
There's something bothering you, Danny.
I don't know what it is, but I can tell.
Oh, I just owe someone some money for something I did once.
I know how it feels, too.
Come on over here.
- See that?
- He looks like a pretty good boy.
- He was pretty good.
- Was?
I killed him eighteen years ago.
Eighteen years ago this month in Memphis.
- In a fight?
- Yeah.
I keep wanting to take that picture down, but I never do.
He was a Mick with a mother and a half a dozen brothers and sisters.
He supported all of them.
I went to the funeral with 1,800 bucks in an envelope, every penny I had in the world.
Well, after the funeral was over,
I walked up to his mother and tried to get her to take the money.
She wouldn't.
I tried to push it into her hands.
- She spit in my face.
- Why?
You didn't owe her anything.
You didn't commit any crime.
The kid died. You didn't want it to happen.
It was part of the business you were in.
I don't get it.
I don't get it either, Danny, but that doesn't change anything, does it?
Good luck.
Three winners and three losers.
- I'm late tonight, Soldier. Sorry.
- All right.
I'll take it now.
- Missed you.
- Sorry.
Small one, please.
Three winners and three losers.
Hit me, please.
- Hello, Danny.
- Hello, Fran.
It's all in the cards, I guess.
- Did Soldier tell you I was here?
- Mm-hmm.
I suppose he thought
I was getting lonesome.
It was a funny thing, Danny, a guy like you getting lonesome.
I couldn't quite figure that.
- But I hoped you were.
- Are you going to stay a while?
I got a job.
Soldier arranged it with Swede.
Soldier's the most practical cupid
I've ever met.
- You're not mad, Danny?
- No.
- When do you start?
- Tomorrow.
Still tied up in knots, aren't you?
You haven't forgotten Arthur.
I'm sorry.
I keep crowding you all the time, don't I?
I'll stop it.
Did you ever forgive me for running out on you?
I never owned you, Danny.
I said, "Did you ever forgive me?"
You're not asking if I forgive you.
You want to know how much a woman will forgive.
You're asking if Arthur's wife would forgive you.
I thought you were going to stop crowding me.
All right, Danny.
Hello!
Who are you?
My mommy's not home.
Don't you remember your uncle Sidney?
Give that back, or I'll tell Mr Branton.
Where is he?
He went to Las Vegas.
Hello, Danny.
Good luck tonight.
I'll see you later.
- You're not going to catch my act?
- You're not nervous, are you?
This is the biggest audience
I've ever had.
- If only you were out there.
- You'll be all right without me.
I'm going over to the casino.
I think I can make a killing.
Good luck.
Good luck to you, Danny.
Three down.
'Mr Dan Haley, telephone for you.
'Mr Dan Haley, telephone for you.'
Thank you. Coming out.
Nine! And in the field, to light the field...
OK. Everybody down in time.
Seven, that's the winner. Seven.
Coming out...
Three, the loser.
Everybody down in time.
Back ten!
Seven, the devil!
Hard way eight, please.
Come on, dice!
Seven!
Put your bets down, folks.
All ready? Good luck!
Four-trey.
Seven!
♪ Your love is all that matters
♪ It's the world, not me
♪ My heart would be in tatters
♪ Without you, what would I be?
♪ So, darling, you love me with a kind of love
♪ That understands
♪ Although it isn't much
♪ My life is in your hands
♪ But what would I do
♪ Oh, what would I do
♪ If I didn't have you
♪ If I didn't have you ♪
Thank you, Soldier.
Well, Soldier fixed it all the way round.
- That was OK.
- Thanks.
- Buy her a drink.
- Sure, Swede.
- What'll you have, Fran?
- I guess this calls for celebration.
- Scotch and water.
- Scotch and water, John.
Soldier, do you know where I can find Danny?
There's an urgent long-distance call for him.
- He's off tonight.
- I'll take it.
Maybe it's important.
Mr Haley's call, please.
Hello?
Mr Haley isn't here.
Could I take a message?
This is a friend of his,
Frances Garland.
Who is this?
Mrs Winant?
Mrs Arthur Winant?
Please, it's urgent that you give a message to him right away.
I've put calls in all of Las Vegas.
Tell him that Sidney Winant was here, that he knows that Danny is in Las Vegas.
He left here almost two hours ago, so please hurry.
Two thousand, let it ride.
Come on, dice. Seven, four-trey.
Nine! Pay the field.
Put it on nine-dice.
Come on, dice.
Come on!
Come on, dice.
Any point but seven-dice, be there!
Eight!
Come on, dice, any point but seven-dice, come on!
Nine!
Danny!
Thanks.
How much have I got?
Will you cover it?
Give the gentleman the dice.
Seven!
- I'd like to cash these in.
- Verywell, sir.
Thank you.
I'll cash these in.
You can cash them tomorrow, he may be here any minute.
I've got a hunch he's here now.
Yes, sir, how do you want it?
Big as you've got.
Let me have an envelope.
- Danny, I'm going with you.
- No.
- I'm going with you.
- Look, Fran, this is important.
If I'm not here in the morning,
I want you to go to the bank, get a cashier's cheque for this made out to Mrs Arthur Winant.
- Mail it to her.
- Danny, I talked to her on the telephone.
From the way she talked, I...
I think she could forget about it.
She was so scared.
I think she'd forgive you.
Thanks.
- Soldier, where's your car?
- Outside.
I'd like to borrow it.
- Sure, Danny, anytime.
- Thanks.
Look after her.
Is there a plane out of here tonight?
Where do you want to go?
I don't care, just away.
Yes?
'Just a minute, Mr Haley,
I have a long-distance call for you.'
- 'Hello? Hello? Danny!'
- Victoria!
'Sidney knows you're in Las Vegas.
Please, be careful. You know he's insane.'
I got your message.
He's following me now.
'Please, Danny be careful, will you? Please.'
'Danny? Oh!
'Danny?
'Hello?
'Operator, give me the police.
Operator?
'Danny, what's the matter?'
That's all, Winant.
'Danny, are you all right?
'Danny, answer, will you?
'Please, Danny.'
Go pick him up, Jim.
Well, you're lucky we got here in time to get you a doctor instead of an undertaker.
- How are you, all right?
- Yeah, fine.
Well, Danny, we took your advice and used you as a decoy.
You certainly didn't leave us much margin of safety.
Nothing to worry about, Captain.
Whoever heard of a dead decoy?
Hello, Victoria.
'Flight 27 loading in Gate 2 for Los Angeles.
'Flight 27 loading in Gate 2 for Los Angeles.'
Fran!
Danny! You're on the same flight?
- You're going back to her?
- No.
Then what are you doing here?
I told you, Danny,
I think she could forget the past.
But I couldn't.
You're my kind of girl, Fran.
You don't want to be alone anymore?
No.
- I don't want to be alone anymore.
- Oh, Danny!
Miss Garland, will you board the plane, please?
Thanks, but we've got...
We've got other plans.
