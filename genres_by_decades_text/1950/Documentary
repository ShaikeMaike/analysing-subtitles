We'd give a lot to know what happened in Rimbaud's mind when he was writing "The drunken boat" in Mozart's mind when he was composing the Symphony Jupiter
To know this secret mechanism which leads the creator in his perilous adventure thanks to God, what is impossible for poetry and music is possible in painting.
To know what happens in the mind of a painter, we only have to follow his hand.
You'll see the strange adventure of the painter. 
He walks, he slips, balanced on the tightrope.
A curve leads him to the right,
A spot pushes him to the left.
If he recovers badly, all falls over, all is lost.
The painter gropes his way, like a blind mind in the darkness of the white canvas.
And the light which appears progressively the painter creates it paradoxally in accumulating the blacks.
For the first time, this daily and confidential drama of the genious blind man will be played in front of an audience.
Since Pablo Picasso agreed to live it today in front of you, with you.
So, what are we doing? we makes another one, don't we?
Unless you are tired
Tired, i like it. and carry on, all night long if you will
OK, let's go
Claude.
Yes?
What remains in the machine?
150 meters it makes 5 minutes
It's enough.
So, in black or in color?
In color, it's more funny.
Ok, what do you want to do?
Whatever.
As usual?
Wait, you'll see, i'll show you a surprise.
Ok.
Let's go..
Listen, we agree : whatever happens to you, you cut
From my side, whatever happens, i cut
Few films remain
NumBER? be careful. are you ready?
Action.
You stop when the black is finished.
Yes.
Well, it's finished.
Cut.
So, i prepare my inks. ok, quickly.
It's ok..
2 minutes only remain for the color.
Action.
Already 30 sec left.
You have no more than 45 sec
It's enough
LIttle more, ok?
OK, but hurry up, i cheated
What?
I cheated to let you more time.
8 seconds
It's alright
I need ink, so stop for a while.
I cut, stop.
Ready.
Tell me when you are ready.
I'm ready
We shoot.
I cut, stop.
6 meters still.
Shoot.
Well, i leave it like it is.
OK, don't move. we shoot again 6 meters.
Cut.
Is it good?
Come and see.
 - What do you think about it?
- and you?
I think i should keep on, make another, in another way, to got to the matter as much.
It's already very good, a very impressive show.
Yes, but it's still a bit outer
I would like to go deeper in the story.
I should take all risks. to see the painting piled up, as the are made 
You would like to show the pictures under one picture
You can't do this in transparency.
No but i could use oil paint, like every day at my working place.
We start with transparency and we'll manage later.
-Its dangerous 
-It will be dangerous
It's what I'm looking for. so, don't bother, go ahead.
We start again.
-OK
Action
Well, I leave it as it is.
Something embarasses me.
The spectators will believe that you made this in 10 minutes.
How many time did I work?
5 hours
So now, every body knows it.
Give me a large canvas.
We pretend i'm at home. 
I don't take care of the cinema, neither anything else.
I try with pieces of paper. all is going badly.
All is going very badly
All is going very very badly.
You are worried
Don't worry, it can end still worse.
Why have you this face? 
You wanted a drama, here is it.
-for the film, it's embarassing.
-Why? for the spectators.
I've never taken care of the audience
I'm too old to start now. 
And , especially, it is that i wanted to show.
The truth taken at the bottom of the well. 
The night is falling
It's falling more and more.
The moon
The stars a meteor
It's very bad.
I pull out all. 
I see an improvement.
Anyway, it's a picture.
Now i almost see where i am, 
I take a new canvas and i start all again.
Well, It's finished.
On this land nothing grew.
And all was desolation,
Wind and Sun.
All life came from the Sea.
And from the marriage of Sea and Sun,
Salt was born on this land.
One day,
some men set foot on this barren land
where nothing grew,
where all was desolation,
Wind and Sun.
And they called this land
It was around 1500...
And those men returned to Spain
with amazing news of an immense salt marsh
"larger than human eyes had ever contemplated."
In those days, salt was as precious as gold.
And Araya became so famous that the King
to protect it, built a fortress,
the second largest in the West Indies.
Pirates, slave traders,
pearl merchants, salt robbers
had made of Araya
the center of piracy in the Caribbean.
What effort to build this fortress
with materials brought from so far away,
in the sun,
without water, without food.
How many men died in that endeavor!
But the abundance of salt was such
that the governor wrote to the King.
"One thousand ships could be loaded at the same time,
"return in twenty days
"and start over again, the whole year round..."
Many years passed.
Costly and useless, the fortress was demolished.
More years passed...
More centuries...
Under the implacable sun,
under the harsh skies...
What remains of Araya?
What is left of its fame?
Of its past?
What became of the slave traders,
the pearl merchants,
the buccaneers?
What of them?
450 years have passed
between that day of discovery
and this breaking dawn.
Another dawn,
the same as so many others,
over the salt, over the wind,
over the dry land of Araya,
one more day is about to begin.
It's 6 in the morning.
And under the first Sun,
the men of Araya are already delivering their salt.
Already they are forming pyramids with the salt
brought from the lagoon the day before.
Today, just like yesterday,
with their hands, with their shovels,
with the strength of their arms,
they reinitiate the daily ritual of the salt.
They reencounter their same ancient gestures,
and start again endlessly under the same sun.
Today, just like yesterday,
across the centuries,
men continue to make their living from the salt marsh.
Today, just like yesterday,
Sun and Sea have not ceased to make Salt
and this,
is the only wealth of these men.
Their gestures always identical, ritualistic, exacting.
Gestures of the salt that rises in pyramids,
that is worked,
carried shoulder high,
washed until blood flows.
Gestures of the salt,
noria of salt and time, never ceasing.
White gold from the sea.
Salt washed with men's sweat.
Salt of the salt miners,
hard crystal of the wind.
Gestures always identical,
noria of salt and time,
never ceasing.
There was never more pure, more beautiful,
than the salt of Araya,
travelers would say.
Salt of the salt miners,
hard crystal of the wind.
Pure and white salt of Araya.
And these pyramids that corrode the skin,
men make and unmake unceasingly,
and time flows,
as if passing through an hourglass
endlessly turning over.
Salt of the salt miners.
Gestures for centuries repeated.
Pure and white salt of Araya.
And the salt leaves the pyramids forever.
For centuries, the salt boat
has been the only link with the outside world.
And the salt of Araya
begins its journey.
Day comes to La Puntilla.
Beltrán Pereda, born in Manicuare,
has spent all night extracting salt from the lagoon,
and now, in each "mara,"
he delivers 140 pounds of salt.
In the salt marsh, each family works as a team.
There are four Peredas.
Fortunato is 25 years old,
he has spent 15 years helping Beltrán,
15 years of nights without sleep.
After Fortunato comes César.
César is 9 years old,
and a future of salt awaits him.
Toñico is the youngest,
and this will be the sole memory of his childhood.
César and Toñico wash the salt
gathered during the night.
César spreads it to be dried by the sun.
Beltrán and Fortunato will deliver this salt tomorrow.
Today, they deliver yesterday's salt.
The round of the salt can not must not be halted.
One day, César will take
Fortunato's place,
and Fortunato that of Beltrán,
thus, the gestures of the salt
shall be indefinitely perpetuated.
Day also breaks on the other side of the lagoon.
Dámaso Salazar and his son, Nemesio,
leave at dawn, to go and "cut" salt,
as they say.
Dámaso and Nemesio are day salt miners,
and they will work from sunrise to sunset.
Some go. Others come.
The marsh is never alone.
On land, Benito Salazar,
the other son, delivers the salt that his father, Dámaso,
and his brother, Nemesio,
gathered yesterday in the lagoon.
Benito and his youth,
tracing and retracing the paths of the salt.
Benito and his arduous daily task.
Benito's "mara" was not the exact weight.
Florentino's watchful eye had noticed it.
Petra,
Petra Salazar,
Benito's and Nemesio's mother,
wife of Dámaso,
has made her life at the foot of the pyramids.
Petra, the salt packer,
for her, too, the weight must be exact.
And her look is dry and bright, like the salt.
And for Benito, salt and sweat, sweat and salt,
until the end of time.
And his day's labor has barely begun.
And once again, the inherited gestures,
the fragile architecture of salt
and its pathways.
Eighteen miles away,
the enclosed marsh is no more,
only the open sea.
Dawn also breaks on Escarceo's shores
for the fishermen returning from their long night at sea.
And ahead of them, too,
a day like any other is about to begin.
The men of Cruz Vasquez
all come from the village of El Rincón.
Hour after hour, under the rising Sun,
they will pull the "mandinga,"
haul on the ropes and gather in the nets
that they cast last night on the open sea.
Adolfo Ortiz is one of them.
He is returning from another night at sea.
Another night on that sea,
all of whose secrets he knows.
At dawn, from the village,
the women have spotted the returning boats,
and Isabel, Adolfo's wife, comes
as she does every morning,
to wait for the fish with her daughter, Carmen.
Adolfo has spent many years pulling the "mandinga,"
tracing the coast line, listening to the tides,
trailing the winds and steering home from the sea.
His boat is called
"La Sensitiva."
All sustenance in Araya
depends on these men,
for on this land nothing grows
and all life comes from the Sea.
The Sea... will it provide today?
And the same waiting, hoping, begins anew
each morning under the Sun.
Carmen,
she too, waits,
waits for the shells, the corals,
the starfish...
and everything the Sea wants to give her.
The morning advances white and hard
over La Puntilla, over the Peredas' pyramid, ever taller.
And already the Sun begins to beat down on Araya.
For Beltrán, Fortunato and the others,
the round of the salt has not stopped.
César and Toñico finish washing the salt cut during the night.
For them,
the day's work on the vast salt marsh is over.
On a crust of burning salt,
feet and legs ulcer quickly
and on open skin, salt is a deep wound.
For a long time, Fortunato, his feet gnawed away by the salt,
could not come to work.
For each "mara,"
Beltrán receives a token.
Each token is worth 50 cents.
And to earn it, the four Peredas have worked night and day.
For 40 years,
Beltrán has worked in the salt marsh,
and today he has carried
70 "maras" of salt.
Beltrán Pereda, 70.
Thus ends one more day
of salt delivery in Araya.
The borders of the marsh remain alone.
Alone remains,
the shimmering salt.
"Pillote 19," the Peredas’ pyramid,
was completed this morning.
Beltrán and his sons, after ending their night vigil
and their dawn delivery,
set off for their village,
Manicuare,
six miles from the salt marsh.
It's 9 o'clock.
And the Sun beats down
even more on Araya.
Dámaso and Nemesio approach the area where they cut their salt.
At 10 o'clock,
the siren concedes the packers a hard earned break.
At dawn, as soon as the salt boat appeared on the horizon,
the siren invaded the depths of every house,
shattered women's dreams and drove them to the foot of the pyramids,
to scoop, to stitch, to weigh.
At any hour of the day or night,
the boats that come to fetch the salt
rule the work and lives
of the salt packers.
Village of the Salazars.
Village of the daytime salt miners.
Once, where these houses stand,
under the same sun,
in the days of the fortress,
there was a time when splendor reigned of which only the name remains.
And Araya is the name of the village where the Salazars live.
The same name as the whole Peninsula.
And the Salt enters Petra's house
to become, at last, table salt.
Dámaso and Nemesio reach the place where they cut their salt.
The Sun is even higher.
Ever stronger.
Dámaso and Nemesio are just getting started.
A "salary"
is the salt earned for a day's work.
That was the first meaning of the word.
The Conquistadors paid their soldiers with salt.
In those days,
salt was as precious as gold.
The waiting will not have been in vain.
Today, the Sea has been generous.
And everyone will benefit.
Again,
the ritual gestures are reinitiated. And again,
the Word comes true.
In Araya,
all life, all sustenance,
comes from the Sea.
And today's abundance
allows other fishing tasks.
There will be food in every house
and surplus to sell.
The beach becomes deserted.
The first burst of excitement has subsided.
Isabel just received her husband Adolfo's share.
Now she can prepare what is to be sold,
and give Carmen the family portion.
Under the Sun, ever higher and more glaring,
Isabel and her neighbors will go from village to village,
selling their fish along the Peninsula.
And their lively hawkers' cries will be heard everywhere.
And the net will unite again the men of the fishing boats.
And again, they will rediscover the daily brotherhood
to live
and survive.
From Escarceo to El Rincón,
Carmen does not return straight home.
She wanders along, gathering shells,
playing with the Sea.
And Carmen, on the solitary beach,
in the clearness of the morning,
pursues her games with the Sea.
In El Rincón, the fishermen's village,
the water truck arrives at last.
El Rincón has 60 houses,
and the truck brings
1,850 gallons of water.
Angelica, hurry up, the truck's here!
I'm going!
Without springs,
without trees, without rain,
Araya is a desert,
and the water from the mainland
barely quenches an ancient thirst.
Geralda, the eldest women of the village
administers the water for the women.
From the Ortiz' house comes Angelica,
Carmen's elder sister.
She will spend all morning
coming and going
from the house to the truck, and back again,
storing water for the whole family.
Each family, depending on its size,
is allocated a certain amount.
There are 16 in the Ortiz family,
and this water
will have to do for everything and everyone.
Thus passes the morning in El Rincón.
Carmen returns with the family share,
and Grandmother is at home.
She is in charge of preparing the corn.
And Carmen,
what does she live on?
Some fish,
some corn,
...and her seashells.
Isabel and her neighbors from El Rincón
arrive in the village of Araya with the fresh fish.
The streets glitter under the hot Sun.
It's 11 o'clock.
Over the land, over the sea,
a steamy haze rises from the burned earth.
And again, the women’s songs are heard in the white washed glare.
Isabel will go from door to door,
and Petra Salzar, the salt packer,
is her first customer.
What have you got there?
Corocoro, chicharra, carite, tajali...
How much for the carite?
Two bolivars a kilo.
And the corocoro?
Three for one bolivar.
And the chicharrita?
Ten cents.
I won't buy your fish anymore.
First, pay what you owe me.
Give me one bolivar more in credit.
She buys five for one bolivar and sells them for six!
She doesn't care if I earn any money!
Keep your money!
Take the fish!
I'll go elsewhere.
And so, Isabel makes her way,
filling the Araya morning with her cries.
Chicharrita, carite, fresh corocoro!
Everyone, at every hour
of every day, carries out their own task.
In Manicuare, at the Peredas' house,
it is also time to buy the fish for Daria, the wife of Beltrán,
the man of the 70 "maras" of salt.
I sell it for 75 cents.
All right, two kilos of cazón.
The money from the salt pays for Isabel's fish.
It's a nice cabañita.
You're very ungrateful!
Five cents.
And the Sea is the only source of life
for the salt packer
and for the fish vendor.
Desideria!
Come and see the fish.
It was so they said
a land of fabulous wealth.
A land where nothing changes,
where the Sun beats more and more fiercely,
where dust burns drier and drier,
where nothing grows.
The Peredas have covered the distance
between La Puntilla and Manicuare.
Manicuare is a row of open houses facing the sea,
with the only cock fighting pit on the Peninsula.
At home, Daria prepares the meal for the salt miners.
With her, is Beltrán's sister,
Luisa, the potter, the best, so they say.
She knows the ancient secrets of soils and clays,
but has never heard of the wheel.
Here, it is still by hand, by fist,
that the "múcuras" are molded.
And daily life
endlessly repeats its same gestures.
After the salt,
eating in silence,
then... sleep.
What more is there?
Outside, the Sun burns down on the houses,
on the sea...
And on the same coast, but much further away,
at the entrance of El Rincón,
"La Sensitiva" also goes to sleep.
In the center of the village,
men and children
come together to finish the tasks of today's abundant catch
forever acknowledging the Sea as their only providence.
Anyway, there is no other choice.
Beneath this Sun, can anyone think of choosing?
From father to son, you are fisherman or salt miner.
And it has always been so.
Anticipating days of scarcity, the foreman has decided
to salt part of the fish.
Isabel returns from her long round.
They all come too soon,
the tears...
the hunger...
Noon.
And more than ever the Sun beats down upon Araya.
And yet, did not God say to men.
"I give you every herb bearing seed
"which is upon the face of all the Earth
"and every tree yielding fruit that bears a seed.
"They shall be your sustenance."
Sustenance, when the Sea gives it for it is not always given
rots in the heat.
It must be salted, and fast.
Salt is the only guardian of life in Araya.
The salt of Dámaso and Nemesio,
of Beltrán and Fortunato,
thus complements Adolfo's fishing.
Fish and salt, salt and fish,
in the closed economy of Araya.
The 3 o'clock Sun
has not stopped Dámaso and Nemesio
in their long day's work.
Nelita and the children
await their father and brother.
Upon Araya,
the sun, the heat,
the torpor, the silence.
And Nelita brings them
their only coffee of the day, sent by Petra.
All afternoon, Dámaso and Nemesio
will prepare the salt cut today
for Benito's delivery tomorrow.
In Manicuare,
the Peredas sleep under the village tree.
And Luisa's "múcuras"
slowly harden under the Sun.
In El Rincón,
Isabel, the fish vendor,
has not yet finished.
She must go back to the paths of sun and dust.
Amid the barren landscape,
the small wood of Guaranache, the only one on the Peninsula.
And the trees of Araya,
will they ever bear anything other than dry branches?
Will new trees ever bear
seeds and fruits?
Isabel waited for the fish,
washed it, sold it,
nursed her child.
Now she is chopping wood.
When will all this fatigue, all this effort, come to an end?
And the Fortress presides again over Araya's afternoons,
with its sun soaked stones, salted by the wind,
filled with nostalgia of sea and centuries.
In the village routine,
around Petra, the salt packer, and Benito, the delivery man,
life goes on beneath the brilliant light.
Dámaso and Nemesio go on working on the piers,
silently,
within their own shadows.
The Sun sets, to give way to the Wind.
2,000 "maras" of salt and sweat set sail today.
Leave?
Benito thinks about it.
But where to?
In Manicuare,
Fortunato follows the kites' path
to the brackish well
at the entrance of the village.
And the clean, the fresh Wind,
now sweeps over the vast peninsula.
The lovers of Manicuare,
what do they say to each other?
They say...
the simplest words,
the words of all times.
Luisa has not yet finished.
With her neighbors, she has come to bake the "múcuras."
And the dry wood from the ancient trees of Araya,
kindled by the strong breeze,
will complete the work of the Sun.
And in the Wind,
Luisa, the potter,
conducts the fire ritual.
It's 5 o'clock.
Evening falls on El Rincón.
Thus pass the days for Angelica,
Carmen and the Grandmother.
Isabel is still in the wood,
and all is renewed as it has been for centuries,
without anything having really changed at all.
Carmen’s shells
have torn the nets of "La Sensitiva."
After a day, like so many others,
Adolfo Ortiz will return again tonight
to cast his nets on the high seas.
Because here,
all life,
all sustenance,
comes from the Sea.
Tonight, there will be a fire to cook the corn at Isabel's house.
The heart of the fisherman's wife knows no weariness.
Her arms know no rest.
This is the marine cemetery.
And it's a date for the Grandmother and Carmen.
Here sleep those who have carried so many "maras,"
fished so many fish.
And in this faraway place,
where flowers refuse to bloom,
the seashells and the corals
those flowers of the sea
bloom in their stead.
The Grandmother and Carmen,
Carmen,
who gathered the shells
have come to make an offering
and to maintain the memory of their dead.
Already Ricardo, the foreman,
calls the fishermen of "La Sensitiva."
And the salt marsh
opens up to the night.
At Dámaso's house,
the night brings rest at last.
Watching her children sleep,
Petra no longer has her dry salt look.
The Peredas resume their nightly labor.
And back come the burns
and back come the open sores from the salt.
For Adolfo, too, the round starts again.
It's midnight.
The salt marsh is never alone.
And each one will reencounter yesterday's gestures.
Once more, the Peredas leave to cut salt.
And Beltrán Pereda,
born in Manicuare,
again becomes a salt miner
returning to his night shift.
And suddenly...
in the barren land,
in ancient Araya,
450 years come face to face.
Will the hardships of men disappear?
Could the ancient world change?
Will machines finally replace the arms of Benito,
of Beltrán and Fortunato,
and build the pyramids?
Are these the last "maras"?
Is this the end of the round of the salt?
And real flowers...
will they bloom here one day
for the ancient dead of Araya?

This is the story of a woman after a war... who lived and hoped... and struggled trough the anxious years, and now saw them end... and another peace begin...
It starts in London on VE Day, 1945.
'This was the day that it started.
'I wish I'd been with my wife that day,
'but I was not in London.
'It was a very special day, meaningful in more than one respect.
'Later, when Kay had told me how it all began,
'I felt how strange it was
'that after we'd been together through so much,
'sharing so many moments of happiness,
'danger, war and pain,
'she should have been all alone that day.
'I'd like to tell you something about her, if I may.
'I say something because
I don't know it all,
'and I'm her husband.
'I've been her husband for quite a long time.
'But does any man know any woman completely?
'You meet somebody, you fall in love with her, you marry her.
'You come to need her more and more,
'to love her more, too.
'And when you're not with her, you long for her with all your heart.
'I hadn't seen my wife for almost a year,
'but she'd been writing regularly, so I knew that she was well.
'This is her story,
Kay's story.
'Oh, and by the way, our name is Miniver.
'Our family was scattered around the globe.
'We hadn't seen each other for years.
'Judy, our daughter, was in Cairo.
'Our young son Toby was in America,
'and I was with the Army in Hamburg.'
This is London.
Please stand by.
The Prime Minister, the Right Honourable
Winston Churchill.
Yesterday morning,
At 2.41am, at General Eisenhower's headquarters,
General Jodl, the representative of the German high command, and Grand Admiral Doenitz, the designated head of the German state, signed the act of unconditional surrender of all German land, sea, and air forces in Europe to the Allied
Expeditionary Force.
The German war is, therefore, at an end.
Advance, Britannia!
Long live the cause of freedom!
God save the King!
Mrs Miniver.
You don't remember me?
Yes, I-I do.
Oh, you're Foley's boy!
Tom Foley, of course!
I'm so sorry, Tom, but after five years...
Six since I last delivered the groceries.
Are you on leave?
Just flew in from Cairo.
Oh, what a day to come home!
I'm so happy for you.
Does your family know?
Dad will be at the station.
Good.
Here, have half a suitcase.
Thank you.
Well, how are they,
Mum and Dad?
Oh, very good.
How's the shop?
Still there.
You had doodlebugs, didn't you, all around the village?
Uh-huh. But it's over now.
Yes.
How was Cairo?
Oh, hot as blazes.
My daughter's over there,
Judy, in the ATS.
I don't suppose you ran into her?
She saw me off.
Tom! Well!
How is she?
Judy's wonderful.
Still a corporal?
She's far too nice to be a brass hat.
We, um, we saw quite a lot of each other.
I'm glad.
It's a bit tricky, though, because of my three pips.
Officers not encouraged to mingle with the unwashed.
However...
I haven't heard from her for ages.
Now I understand why.
Oh, she...she sent this.
For me?
Oh! That's a nice change.
Tom, will you forgive me if I...?
Of course.
Go ahead. I'll smoke.
"Hello, Mother, darling.
"Tom Foley's just leaving for home,
"so I'm dashing this off in a mad rush in the middle of the night
"to let you know all's well on the Nile.
"The lights are out, and the girls are asleep,
"so I'm writing on my knee in the bathroom.
"Who do you think I've been driving around for the last month?
"Steve Brunswick.
"Wherever he goes, I take him and bring him back.
"It's wonderful to be with a man who's really lived life to the dregs."
All serene?
Yes.
Tom, do you know a man called Brunswick?
A brigadier?
Brunswick...
Oh, Steve Brunswick.
Commando Johnny?
Good heavens, yes, he's a marvellous chap. Why?
Oh, Judy mentions him.
He's out there now.
Careless talk.
She ought to be shot.
That's what she says.
Anything like her?
Tom, it's splendid!
Are you always as good as this?
I happen to know this particular subject rather well.
I hope to know her even better.
I'm so glad you were at the station,
Mr Foley.
I just couldn't have walked another step today.
Takes it out of you, doesn't it, all this history?
Thank you so much.
All alone here tonight?
Oh, no, I have my boarders,
Mr Farraday and Richard.
Oh, yes, well,
Mr Miniver will be home before long now, I reckon.
I hope so.
I'm delighted
Tom's back.
Tell Mrs Foley, will you?
I'll tell her.
I like your boy.
Good night.
Good night, Mrs M.
All the best.
Thanks, Tom.
Oh, could I...could I have Judy back?
Oh...yes.
Good night.
Thank you, Mrs Miniver.
Good night.
Anybody home?
Spike!
I'll be back in a minute.
Hi!
I just thought
I'd drop by and say congratulations.
Well, thank you.
Have I won anything?
Only a war.
From here in, Kay, you're a veteran.
You, too, Colonel.
Well, that puts me in nice company.
Let's shake on it.
We might even have a cup of tea on it.
Come inside.
I'm due back at the base right now.
But I was hoping you might care to look in at the
George with me later.
I guess most of the village will be there.
Kind of a farewell visit.
Farewell?
We're pulling out
Sunday.
Oh, no, Spike.
Oh, I am sorry.
I did want you and Clem to meet.
I know.
I sort of, er, wanted to say hello to that husband of yours myself.
He must be quite a guy.
Will you come?
Please.
I'd love to.
Swell. Pick you up at 8.30.
We're going to miss you in the village.
We're going to miss the village.
Somehow, I just can't believe that it's over.
It isn't.
Sure, some of the fighting's stopped.
A few generals have signed some documents on Lueneburg Heath.
For the rest of us, you can't just snap your fingers and say,
"Forget it, brother.
Go on home.
"Take up the old routine where you left off."
When a war happens, a whole new life happens along with it.
And you're a part of mine, Kay... a very important part.
Well, I know we haven't seen each other more than...how often?
A dozen times?
Tea in the garden after a mission, a couple of movies, watching a soccer match.
Probably it doesn't mean very much to you, but it's helped, more than you know.
I didn't stop loving Ellen when I started to love you.
Dear Kay, don't look so worried.
I'm not expecting you to say anything except maybe
"Here's a guy I knew in the war.
"Nice to have met him."
I know it's all on my side.
You're married.
You too, Spike.
Only I'm here, and Ellen's there.
Sort of a mess
I'm in, all right.
Oh, you'll snap out of it.
Very un-British, shooting my mouth off.
Only, this is our last evening.
And I just had to tell you.
You're not mad at me?
No, Spike, I'm not mad.
It's...it's nice to know that one's been of use, if I have.
Let's dance.
My friends!
Tonight, Europe is free!
To the British
I say, "Jolly decent of you!"
To the Americans,
"Nice work, kids!"
To my own country, I say
"God bless you."
Very soon now, I return to you and to my dear wife and children.
Don't worry, darling.
Not tonight.
And so to all of you, to all the people and armies of liberation, on behalf of all Europe, tonight, I say...
Wait a minute!
Wait a minute!
Won't you say something, Colonel?
Please?
Well, this isn't quite my line.
You go ahead.
Oh, no.
Come on, Spike.
Do it. It would be nice.
OK.
Thanks, pal.
American... here.
I guess some of us will be leaving soon.
So, maybe I'd better make this goodbye.
When we first came to England, we weren't too keen about the idea.
"It's murder," they told us.
"Rains all day, and the folks keep themselves to themselves."
Well, it rained.
They were right there.
We've had bad times and good times.
We've had an awful lot of war together.
So long, England.
Thanks for everything.
And have yourselves a good rest.
For he's a jolly good fellow
He's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow
And so say all of us.
'It was a beautiful summer,
'that first summer of peace.
'England had a new kind of government,
'the world had a new kind of a bomb,
'and the weather was perfect day after day.
'It was as if God were saying,
' "This is what life could be like if only you'd let it."
'It was still a beautiful summer when I said goodbye to Europe.
'The weather was perfect.
'Two hours later, we were home.
'I was the last of the family to come home.
'Judy had just returned from Cairo,
'Toby, from America.
'At long last, the four of us were home.
'And I was looking forward to a holiday of rest and happiness
'with Kay and the children.'
How long has this been going on?
About 12 months.
About 12 months?
There's one up in Toby's room, too.
Is that so?
And another in the kitchen, but that's over the sink, so that doesn't matter.
Nothing matters.
You're home.
It's about time.
Yes.
Listen to that, Dad!
Mary Lou gave me a dozen records the day I left the States.
Let's get this coat off.
Who's Mary Lou?
My girl!
She's super!
Super?
Yes! She cuts about the meanest rug in Morgan Falls.
Oh, she does?
Yeah, we were going steady until peace came and wrecked everything.
Mary Lou's 10.
Oh, she'll be 11 in March.
Well, that's different.
Sorry, Dad.
That's mine.
What is it?
Baseball.
No, no, not like that.
Let me show you.
Batter up!
What?
Batter up!
Home run!
Home run?
Yeah!
All right,
I'll answer it.
It's for me.
It's for me.
Hello, Steve.
I'm sorry.
I can't hear.
Who?
Oh, it's you.
Toby. Teddy Fathergill.
Excuse me, Dad.
She was easier to understand when she was younger.
< So were you.
Hiya, Teddy.
Yes, we just brought
Dad home.
No, I can't make it tonight.
I told you.
My father.
Back from the war and all that.
I have to stand by and look happy.
OK, bye, Teddy.
Who is, um...
Who's Teddy?
He's a friend of mine.
Teddy Fathergill.
He's English, of course.
Ah, that's too bad.
Say, Dad. You look kind of lost.
Why don't you give the body a break and go dunk yourself in the drink?
Uh...drink?
I mean, take a nice plunge in the dipper and have yourself a rubdown.
Well, thank you, Toby.
Thank you very much.
You're welcome.
I say, Dad! Will you get a load of that horn!
Batter...
Batter up.
Everything all right, darling?
Fine, fine. I'm about to dunk myself in the drink, get a load of a rubdown, and have myself a fine dip in the plunger.
I may also cut a few carpets if I have time.
Oh, and by the way,
I just made a home run.
Dee dee da something something something something
Goes in there
Then the lights go on again...
Come in.
Feeling better?
I feel fine, wonderful, magnificent. Don't I look it?
You look sweet.
Thank you. >
So do you.
Come here a minute.
Gosh, that's frightening.
What is?
You...grown up.
And really quite lovely, if I may say so.
You may say so.
Oh, it's wonderful to have you back again!
It's good to be back.
Believe me.
Hand me my socks there, will you?
Well, young lady, how's everything?
How many hearts have you broken already?
I don't know why it's a shock to discover you have a beautiful daughter, but it is.
You know, when you were, oh, six months old, you were the ugliest thing I've ever seen in my life.
Yes, you were.
You took after me then.
Whereas now you take after your mother.
Ah, yes, you do.
I can see we're going to have a lot of trouble with you.
Father?
Can we talk?
Just for a minute.
Seriously, I mean.
Alone.
Oh, well, I think that might be arranged.
I'm afraid I'm going to shock you again, and this time, I don't think you'll like it.
I want you to know right away.
There's no secret about it.
Mother knows, but I'd rather you heard it from me.
Father, you know
Steve Brunswick, don't you?
Well, I...I don't know him.
I've heard of him, of course. Why?
I'm in love with him.
He's a little old for you, isn't he, darling?
38, but that doesn't matter.
I mean, if that was all...
He understands me, and I think I understand him.
Is that so difficult?
Yes, it is, rather.
We met in Cairo at the end of the war.
He's home now.
We've seen each other several times.
Is he in love with you?
I don't know yet.
I think so.
I hope so.
Well, then, everything seems to be more or less satisfactory, as far as it goes.
No, it isn't.
You see, he's married.
He has been for 12 years.
His wife is Pamela Lyndon, you know, the pianist.
She's awfully nice,
I believe.
They used to have dreadful rows, but that was Steve's fault.
At least, he said so.
It's probably true.
And then he met me.
We have rows, too, but I don't mind it.
He's like that, you know, temperamental.
I love him so terribly.
I-I thought it was just the war, and I'd get over it, but it wasn't and I...
I haven't.
And now, it's worse than ever.
And I...
Thanks.
I suppose I should tell you all the wise and sensible things a father's supposed to have up his sleeve for these occasions, but I'm not sure that I know them.
And I'm not so sure they'd help very much.
Would they, huh?
I'm awfully sorry.
Food!
Life's quite a business, isn't it, then?
Uh...all right?
Very nice, darling.
A little tight around the middle.
I seem to have grown.
You know this is the first time we've all been together since 1940?
Yes, it is.
Why, it's quite an occasion, isn't it?
Shall I make a speech?
No? Well, all right, all right.
All together, huh?
Sorry, darling, what were you going to say?
Nothing. This soup, good stuff.
You haven't lost your touch.
Bits and pieces from yesterday.
Rather appropriate.
Dad?
Huh?
Have you got any souvenirs?
What of exactly,
Toby?
You know, Europe.
Scars of battle.
Mary Lou's father was on Guadalcanal.
Killed four Japs in 20 minutes.
Brought home a Samurai sword he stripped off one of the corpses.
Toby!
That's the kind they use to commit hara-kiri.
Push the hilt of the sword in the ground and jam your belly hard on the blade.
Works like thunder.
Splits their gizzards from top to bottom.
Like this.
Oh, Toby, shut up.
We'll all be sick.
Been like this for days.
America was a bad mistake.
Will you do me a favour? Collapse.
Toby, darling, would you do something for me?
Of course, Mother.
Anything.
Forget about those
48 states for 24 hours and try and make do with your unfortunate family.
I'll go!
You know, Toby,
I'm afraid I'm going to prove a grave disappointment to you.
No medals, no trophies, no scars.
I've still got both arms and both legs.
My eyes are a bit groggy, and I'm afraid I'm going to need glasses.
But that's the best
I can do for you.
As a homecoming warrior,
I'm a complete washout.
You're OK, Dad.
You went to Dunkirk.
It's Steve!
He's at the Majestic in Roxbury.
He's asked me over for dinner.
Darling, would you think it simply dreadful if...?
Oh, no, Judy.
Not tonight.
I know it's awful, but I won't be late.
And I haven't seen him for 10 days.
Oh, it's not that, it's...
As a matter of fact,
I'd be rather glad to get rid of the brat.
Then I could have you to myself.
All right, Judy.
She's all mixed up.
Can't eat, can't sleep, can't do anything.
I was like that with Mary Lou the first two weeks, but we came through OK.
You just have to adjust.
Yeah.
Gosh! If you really mean that about being alone,
I guess I'll go and see
Teddy Fathergill.
He's all mixed up, too.
Really?
His dad's a socialist.
Gotta straighten him out.
Go right ahead,
Toby, and leave the old folks at home.
OK.
Goodbye, boy.
Bye!
Bye.
Bye.
Hello, darling.
'I remember that evening for lots of reasons.
'The homecoming, the way
Kay looked, the kids.
'After they'd gone, we cleared the meal away and went out.
'The rain had stopped, and there was that strange light over everything
'that comes so often in England at the end of summer,
'when it's a little too early to put on the lamps
'and a little too late to see everything clearly and true.
'We made a sentimental journey around the garden.
'It was good to be alone... and together.
'This is Kay's story, not mine,
'but I have to tell that evening through my eyes, not hers.
'I don't think there's very much difference.
'It was full of all kinds of memories, gay and grim.
'Extraordinary, the wide swing from the fear and terror of those nights in the shelter
'to the utter peace of the river that night I came home.
'It was good to see the old lady once more.
'She was beyond repair, and we never used her again.
'We couldn't afford it, and we hadn't the petrol.
'But she, too, was full of memories for both of us.'
No petrol.
I wonder if...
I seem to remember that there was a...
Huh?
Yes.
There might be a drop in it.
Yeah, good.
Five years old, that stuff.
Dunkirk spirit.
Still works.
Let's hope so.
Hello, sir.
Hello, Captain.
I heard you were back, sir, so I thought I'd just drop by and say welcome home.
Thank you,
Captain.
Who is it?
Foley's boy.
Thank you, Tom.
Thank you very much.
Delighted to see you.
We've, er, just been to Dunkirk.
Come aboard, Tom.
Oh, thank you.
Well, Tom Foley.
When did you get back?
VE Day, sir.
Hm, lucky fellow.
Have a good war?
Oh, fair to middling, you know, sir.
Am, uh...Europe?
No, sir.
Desert mostly.
Cairo and the Middle East.
Cairo?
Well, our girl,
Judy, was out there with the ATS.
I don't suppose you saw anything of her?
Well, funnily enough, sir,
I did bump into her.
Did you hear that, darling?
Tom Foley here met
Judy out in Cairo.
Well, well! You must come over and say hello to her sometime.
She's home now, you know.
Yes, yes, I know, sir.
I'm afraid she's out for the evening, Tom.
Oh, really?
Well, goodbye, sir, and it's really great having you back.
Thank you, Tom.
Thank you very much indeed!
I'll tell Judy
I saw you.
Oh, don't bother.
I just dropped by to say hello to Mr Miniver, that's all.
Goodbye!
Goodbye, Tom Foley.
You know that I've hardly said two words to that boy in my life, and yet he takes the trouble to ride over here this evening simply to welcome me home?
I call that extraordinarily decent of him, don't you?
Yes, dear, I do.
There's some days you don't like to see go.
I'd like to put the clock back and have this one all over again.
The rain... roof leaking... everything.
Yes, it's been a lovely day.
Judy's not home yet.
Still striking.
Give Cinderella till the last chime.
There she is now.
Worried about her?
Yes...aren't you?
Yes.
I could talk to her.
I tried.
I don't think you can talk someone out of love.
What are we going to do about it?
Wait, I think.
Of course, we could ask Toby to straighten her out.
I wish she'd find someone like you.
Well, that's a tall order, rather like reaching for the moon.
I'm in.
Good night, darlings!
Judy? Did you have a good time?
You don't have a good time with Steve.
He's not like that.
What is he like?
Different.
Good night, Father.
Apparently that's the technique these days.
In order to be a success with the modern girl, you have to be different.
Uh...was I different when you married me, darling?
You were unique.
Unique?
Unique...
Of course it's nice to see you again, darling.
But...the real joy of coming home is to be able to stand in your own bathroom once more.
Brush your own teeth in your own hot water!
Don't know how lucky you are!
Hot water, soap... all the delights of civilization, right at your fingertips.
If I could have...found a bathroom like this,
I probably never would have come home at all.
Ahh, that was wonderful.
It's funny the pleasure you can get out of a simple...
Kay?
What is it?
Darling, you're... you're so pale.
Am I?
It's...light...
What's this?
Well, it's...just... it's something for when you feel faint.
Feel faint?
Don't look so worried, darling.
But I am worried.
I'm scared stiff!
It's...it's all right.
I just get a little... dizzy spell now and then.
When it happens, then I... take two of these little things, and...I feel fine.
You mean you've had this sort of thing before?
Occasionally, not for ages.
But why didn't you tell me?
Darling, it's just a giddy turn.
Had to happen tonight.
Haven't had one for months.
It's your fault... coming home, getting me all excited.
Now, do you...really feel all right now?
Of course, darling.
Now don't make a fuss, there's a dear.
You frightened the life out of me.
Oh, poor darling.
High time I got home. You've been overdoing it.
Oh, don't be an old woman.
I'm not.
But I'd like you to be, one day.
Don't rush me.
Anything else you haven't told me?
Any lovers tucked away that I don't know about?
Dozens.
Just what I thought.
And you?
Hundreds.
Dotted all over Europe, from Normandy to the Rhine.
They're going to be lonely tonight.
Nice talk,
Mrs Miniver.
Stop a minute, darlings.
I wonder, is the doctor in?
Yes, but have you an appointment?
No, not today, but
I did rather want to see him for a second if he could squeeze me in.
Well, I'm not sure.
Is it urgent?
Not urgent, but, well, important.
I wouldn't be more than five minutes.
Come in, won't you?
I'm Mrs Kanesley, and you're...?
Mrs Miniver.
Oh, yes.
Harry's really not seeing anyone today.
It's my birthday.
Oh. Oh, I am sorry.
Not that it's your birthday, but for disturbing you.
Doctors' wives see so little of their husbands, don't they?
We get used to it.
The children.
A children's party!
Oh, I couldn't spoil that.
Don't bother, I'll go.
I'll get it!
Mrs Miniver, hello!
I'm so sorry about all this.
Come in, won't you?
Thank you.
Let's see...you don't know my three offspring, do you?
The others are on loan.
Hello, where is everybody?
Hello, come here, come on, come and say hello.
Now, this is Michael.
Hello.
How do you do,
Michael?
That is Susan.
Hello.
How do you do,
Susan?
And that is Joanie.
How do you do,
Joanie?
She only does that if she likes you.
All right, darling, that'll do.
You run away and play with yourself.
Fall out, you two.
How about a cup of tea?
Oh, no, thank you.
I really do feel horribly guilty intruding like this on your one day off.
Nonsense. One of the few women I'd get up for in the middle of the night.
I see what he means.
Why haven't we met before?
I've never been ill before.
Oh, are you?
I'm sorry. You look splendid.
Let's go in here, shall we?
Just for five minutes.
How lovely the park looks today, doesn't it?
Yes, autumn.
Strange melancholy time of year.
Do you think so?
I rather like it.
I've been sitting outside there under the trees for the last half hour, watching the leaves fall and trying to screw up enough courage to come in and see you.
Why, was it so difficult?
You don't smoke, do you?
No, thank you.
Yes, it was...very.
I had no idea coming to see the doctor could be such an adventure.
Oh, it is always... especially today.
Today?
Oh! Today I'm less alarming than ever.
Do you like wildflowers?
They're rather a hobby of mine.
Limonium vulgare, what we call sea lavender.
Charming name, isn't it?
You know, flowers get called after all sorts of things, where they're found, people who find them.
It's fascinating sometimes.
Rosa canina, wild rose.
Rose...
Once a few years ago, someone...
Oh, nothing...memories.
Tell me, please.
Not just now.
You're going to tell me something.
Something I want to know.
You are, aren't you?
Well, that rather depends what it is.
You know what it is.
How long have I got?
Please.
It's all right,
I want to know.
I realise you're not supposed to tell me.
It's...bad for the patient.
Professional ethics, and all sorts of reasons.
A few months ago, when you first hinted that it might be serious,
I...I was glad of them.
I preferred to clutch at straws, and pretend to myself.
But I've changed my mind.
It's a woman's privilege.
Well...I'm right, aren't I?
Is your husband back?
Yes, two days ago, and the children.
That's the chief reason
I'm here today, the family.
There's so much to do, and there's just... so much time to do it in.
And so I...
I want to know how much.
Please.
You're not afraid, are you?
I'm not sure.
I mind, of course.
I love my husband very much.
He's going to miss me dreadfully.
That sounds vain and conceited, but it isn't, really.
It's been rather a perfect marriage.
No, I don't think
I'm afraid.
One's become accustomed to... to death these last few years.
So many went, the young ones.
It's a tragedy when the young ones go.
An older person getting an illness that can't be cured... well, that's just bad luck.
I say rather that's it's a pity.
I'm not sorry for myself, and honestly,
I don't want anyone else to be sorry for me.
Does your husband know?
Not yet.
Well, I think he should.
I'll tell him... at the right moment.
How will you know when that is?
I'll know.
Now, be a nice man and tell me... how long?
Not less than six months, not more than a year.
Thank you.
Sorry, that was hard, wasn't it?
Look. I'm the doctor, you're the patient, you remember?
I'll try.
10 out of 10 for you.
What's that?
Full marks.
Hello, darling.
Busy?
No, come in.
I didn't know you were in town today.
I've been shopping.
Quite suddenly I...
I thought I'd like you to take me home.
When you're ready, I mean.
There's no hurry.
I shan't be two minutes.
No hurry.
What is it?
You've changed.
Changed?
Yes. Since this morning.
Something's different. You, er...
Oh, yes... it's the hat. New, isn't it?
Like it?
Very becoming.
You do look nice.
It's the first new one
I've had for five...no, six years.
Why today suddenly?
I don't know... just felt like it.
Sometimes a new hat does something for you.
I know.
Only this morning,
I was saying to myself,
"Miniver," I said, "Why don't you buy yourself a new bowler?
"Might do something for you."
You had a good day?
Oh, so-so.
Somehow the prospect of starting in again on my own isn't wildly exciting.
You might take an apprentice.
Do you know of any good young draftsmen hanging about?
Foley's boy draws very well.
I saw some sketches he did of Judy, and they were excellent.
He's a nice boy, too, Clem.
I rather wish that Judy would...
Do you like nuts?
Yes...
Yes, I like nuts.
"We in Brazil have in mind a certain building project
"along modern
European lines,
"and our minister of highways and civil construction,
"Senor Jose
Antonio Campos,
"will be visiting Europe shortly to discuss this project.
"Tenders will be invited from the most vigorous
"and enterprising architects of the day."
I've just written to him.
Oh.
Aren't I vigorous and enterprising?
Yes, darling.
Wouldn't you like to go and live in Brazil?
What?
Wouldn't you like to get out and away from all this, miles away, where the sun shines and there aren't any ruins on your doorstep?
Kay...
I can't tell you what it was like going across Europe.
Through one country after another, the desolation and the emptiness, the sense of utter futility.
It got into me, somehow, and I just can't seem to shake it off.
England isn't Europe.
It's too close!
It belongs!
We could take the kids and clear out.
We still got a good few years together.
Other people are doing it. They're making a fresh start abroad.
What do you say?
It's out of the clear sky.
I...I wasn't expecting it.
You've only just come home.
I'm thinking of the future.
That's an old one.
What is it?
Let's dance.
Dance?
Where? When?
Here. Now.
'She meant it.
I didn't know why...
'only that she meant it, quite seriously.
'As I took her hands,
'I remember thinking she had changed.
'It wasn't just the hat, it was Kay.
'There was something... elusive about her suddenly.
'Something...intangible.
'So, there in the office, we danced.'
Hell's bells!
Very funny.
Darling, are you all right?
Maimed for life,
I should think.
There's a car coming.
Hello.
Breakdown?
Yes, ignition failure.
Coil's gone.
Oh, I'm afraid that's a garage job. I'll have a look if you like.
No, it's all right.
I've got help coming.
Tom!
Hello!
Oh, friend of yours?
Yes, sir! Foley, late captain,
Royal Engineers.
Oh, I'm Brunswick.
Yes, I know, sir. You gave us a pep talk in Cairo, before Alamein.
Was I good?
Well, you were short, sir.
Oh...pleased to meet you, Foley.
Demobbed?
Yes, sir. I got out under class C.
Lucky blighter.
Wouldn't have a cigarette on you, would you?
I think so.
Where are you off to at this ungodly hour?
Oh, it's market day.
Dad keeps the grocery shop in Belham.
Belham?
Steve, do get in.
You'll catch cold!
Is your van full up?
How do you mean?
Be a good chap and give Miss Miniver a ride home.
Surely.
No, Steve,
I'm staying with you.
You'll do as you're told.
You're with the Army now...right?
Right!
I've got a pig on board, but there's room for one more.
Out you come.
Steve, please let me stay.
I'd much rather.
Shut up.
You'll freeze.
Shut up!
Please, Steve, please.
Do as you're told and don't argue.
It's a man's world and you won't accept it.
Don't you agree,
Captain?
Oh, yes, sir, absolutely.
Come on, then.
If she makes any trouble, wallop her.
That's an order.
Yes, sir.
Steve, when will I see you?
Oh, your cigarettes.
Oh, keep 'em, sir.
Thank you, Captain.
You'd be a major for this if the war weren't over.
I'll see what I can do for you in the next one!
Go away!
Where on earth did you get that thing?
He's not a thing.
He's a noble beast.
Aren't you, George?
He smells.
Is he yours?
No.
All right,
George. Go on.
No, I'm collecting him for the Nesbits.
He's a breeder.
Have you known him long?
Who?
Brigadier Brunswick.
He's a general.
OK, General Brunswick.
Have you?
Yes.
How long?
Ages.
Like him?
He's a wonderful person.
In war or peace?
Both!
Does he, er, dance well?
He does everything well.
That's why I've seen nothing of you since Cairo.
You've seen me.
At the shop in the queue a couple of times.
You can't make love to a girl in a queue.
Well, don't look so shocked.
I used to, quite a bit, in the Middle East.
When you were just a dumb little corporal with a couple of stripes.
Yes, and you didn't mind it, either.
In fact, you liked it, didn't you?
Yes, Tom, I did.
I liked it.
Well?
Well, it's different now.
I'm not.
Well, I'm not either, really, only I...
Oh, what's the use?
Ha ha ha! You are miserable, are you?
No, I'm not.
I'm wildly, wildly happy, and I'm going on being happy with Steve and I don't care what anyone thinks.
No-one thinks anything, do they?
I don't.
Just wondered why
I hadn't seen you, that's all.
I like you.
I think you're a fool, mind, but I like you.
Thanks.
Don't mention it.
Here we are.
Tom...
Yes, Judy?
I...
I just wanted to say...
..thanks for the lift.
That's all right.
Thanks for coming.
That's all right.
Friends?
Friends.
Other Eden, demi-paradise.
Precious stone set in a silvery sea.
This blessed plot, this earth, this realm, this England.
What's all that?
Oh, I was just saying how much I love my country and the weather.
Winter's all right.
Nice and crisp and invigorating.
What's wrong with winter?
Nothing, when the bath water's hot.
Sorry, darling, it's only every other day from now on.
Oh, Clem, these cuffs will never do.
Shall I turn them?
Come in!
Morning, Mother, morning, Dad.
Morning, Toby.
Gosh, Dad! That's one of my handkerchiefs!
That was one of your handkerchiefs, Toby.
It's now performing a more important function.
What's that?
Keeping your father warm in a vital part of his anatomy.
What happened,
Dad?
Nothing happened.
If you must know the sordid details, my collar was frayed.
Life must go on, so we operated.
The tail of my shirt is the tale of England.
Here's the post,
Mother.
There's one for you from the States.
Can I have the stamp after you've read it?
Thanks awfully!
You know, darling, my wardrobe is gradually becoming nonexistent.
If somebody doesn't do something about it pretty soon, one of these fine days, well, I'm just going to disintegrate.
I'm afraid the only solution is to enter the black market in a big way.
Trouble is, I haven't the faintest idea how to set about it.
Have you?
Oh, sorry, darling.
Who's it from?
Spike.
Spike?
The American I met while you were away.
Ah, yes.
I've often wondered about that.
Have you, dear?
Of course he fell in love with you.
Of course.
Well, what's the news from America?
He sent us a food parcel about a month ago.
I wonder what's happened to it.
It takes six weeks.
Oh, oh, oh, he's accepted.
Senor Jose
Antonio Campos is coming down to lunch tomorrow.
Who?
The man from Brazil.
Uh, "Tenders will be invited from the most vigorous
"and enterprising architects of the day."
Don't you remember?
Well, I sent in a few ideas and asked him to come down and feed with us if he were interested, and he's coming tomorrow.
You did what?
I asked him to lunch.
Clem!
Clem, how could you?
You know we haven't enough of anything.
None of the plates match,
I have no cooking fat.
That's just what he wants.
He asked me to beg you not to put on a show for him.
Oh, nonsense.
Listen.
"Please ask your wife not to make any specialities for me.
"With the English today,
"it's an honour to eat bread and cheese."
We can't possibly have an important man like that down to the house and give him what we have to eat.
Well, that's the whole point.
He wants to see a typical English meal.
Well, he may want to see it, he won't want to eat it.
But he does.
Men like that are used to Brazil, where they have all those nuts and things.
He's just being polite.
Clem, really, it's too bad.
You women are fantastic.
264, please.
It's the same thing every time.
A foreigner comes to England, having heard tales of our austerity and want, and positively bursting with sympathy and understanding, and the minute he puts foot in somebody's door, what happens?
You women start a conspiracy.
You beg and you borrow, and you scrape together a full-size meal!
Don't ask me how you do it or where it comes from...
Go away.
All I know is the poor, unsuspecting visitor staggers out of the house, his stomach bulging with four people's rations for a month, convinced we're a nation of hypocrites and not half as badly off as we say we are.
I won't sh!
The tale spreads across the ocean.
Highly delicate negotiations are compromised and the foreign policy of the country is seriously undermined and it's all your fault!
Are you listening to me?
No.
Hello?
Sophie?
Oh, Sophie, I'm awfully sorry to trouble you, but Clem has been perfectly ridiculous and invited a complete stranger down for lunch tomorrow.
So I wondered, could you possibly...
Er, yes, dear, some marge and lard, and er... Oh!
And, er, oh, yes, yes.
And, er, Sophie...
..the Wedgwood?
Brazil? Do they play rugger?
We'll ask them when we get there.
If they don't, we'll make 'em.
Be swell to get back to America.
South America.
North, south, what's the difference?
The difference is considerable.
But don't worry about it because we shall probably stay here.
Seems kind of screwy.
I mean, we don't rate any longer.
We're a vanishing class.
Oh, we are, are we?
Well, who says so?
Teddy Fathergill.
Who?
Oh, oh, yes.
You know, he's a socialist.
But I thought you were going to straighten him out.
Oh, I had a go at him, but he had a go at me, too.
He won.
Bye!
Bye!
Judy not down yet?
No, she was rather late in, so I thought I'd let her sleep on.
Clem?
Are you serious about Brazil?
Thinking about it.
Thinking hard.
Be a big chance for you, wouldn't it?
That's not the point.
Would you listen to me for a minute?
I know you can think of a dozen arguments for staying put.
So can I, if I want to.
But there's one tremendous reason for clearing out.
You.
Me?
Do you really think you've been fooling me?
You had quite a war,
Mrs Miniver.
You're having quite a peace.
Cooking, washing, scrubbing, standing in queues, hunting for rations, finding the meals, reading the headlines and worrying about Judy, about Toby, about me.
No, Clem...
Will you listen to me for just a minute?
There are times, quite a number of times, when you feel so utterly and completely tired that you could sit down on the stairs and cry like a child.
It might be quite an idea to take you out of the fish queue.
Give you a nice hot meal cooked by somebody else for a change.
Sit you out in the sun for an hour or two.
So it's...it's all on my account, this idea?
No, it's not.
I told you, I want to get out of Europe.
And then there's Judy.
Doesn't it occur to you that to get her away at this time might not at all be a bad notion?
Yes, darling,
I know.
But there's...
I'll go.
Hello?
Uh, yes?
Yes, no, I'm sorry,
I'm afraid she's not down yet.
Who?
Who is speaking, please?
Oh, General Brunswick.
Yes, it is.
How do you do?
I've, er, I've heard a lot about you.
Oh, I'm sorry, that wasn't meant to sound ominous.
Your coat?
It's quite safe.
Shall I send it to you, or will you...?
Well, I...I'd like to meet you.
Uh, well, if you could wait two days,
I could bring it.
Friday at 12.30?
Well, I'd like that very much.
All right, I shall look forward to it.
'A a few days later,
Kay took the 10.40 to London.
'Judy wanted her mother to know this man who meant so much to her,
'and Kay was determined to meet him.
'Brunswick lived in Westminster, only 10 minutes from my office.
'I had offered to return the coat for her,
'but she was adamant.'
Hell's bells!
Yes?
General Brunswick?
Good grief!
Are you Mrs Miniver?
Kay Miniver, yes.
Good grief.
You're a surprise.
A pleasant one?
Decidedly.
That daughter of yours never told me.
You're a lot younger than I thought.
What were you expecting?
Oh, I pictured something nondescript, middle-aged.
You're quite a beautiful woman, in your way.
Not really.
This is one of my good days.
Here's the coat.
Oh, thanks very much.
I've got foul manners.
What are we standing here for?
Come in and have a drink.
Thank you.
I'd like a drink.
Ignore the chaos,
I'm on my way out.
Today?
No, tomorrow.
This is my wife's flat, really.
She gets back from
Canada Sunday night.
Your wife?
Pamela Lyndon.
Yes, yes, of course.
Do you like good music or jazz?
Uh, both.
Ever hear her?
I heard your wife give a Greek concerto a week before the war began.
First-class pianist, Pam.
Magnificent woman in many ways.
Impossible to live with.
Sherry?
Thank you.
Women are impossible for the most part, you know?
They get a bee in their bonnet about something and they won't let it drop.
They will go on and on.
I must say, you don't look as if you'd go on and on.
But you probably do, if the truth were known.
I'm worse than most.
Sit down.
Good grief, you're young to have a girl like Judy.
I suppose everyone says that.
Uh, it has been said before.
But I never tire of hearing it.
Cheers.
Cheers.
Do you fight a lot in your family?
Or is everything placid and respectable?
Oh, we tear each other to pieces all day long and half the night.
Hasn't Judy told you?
No, she hasn't said much.
To be honest, she hasn't had much chance.
When we're together,
I talk most of the time.
What do you talk about?
Oh, life, love, the world in general.
The world's in a mess, did you know that?
I had heard something.
Hmm. You look reasonably intelligent for a woman.
Why haven't we met before? >
It wasn't my doing.
You steered clear of us.
Thought it was best, considering.
You probably hate my guts, don't you?
I haven't had time to hate you yet.
You'll get around to it.
I'm starting the divorce as soon as Pam gets back.
Or rather she's starting it.
She cabled yesterday.
It'll take some time, of course.
As soon as it's through,
I'll marry your daughter.
Probably won't last, but I'll marry her.
Time.
How much time?
A year, 18 months.
There's a queue of people waiting to get separated.
You don't like that, do you?
You want to see your chick settled.
Every mother wants that.
But you're in a hurry.
How do you know?
I know women and I read faces.
It was my job in the war, to guess the other chap's move and beat him to it.
Why are you in a hurry,
Mrs Miniver? >
You must be a very difficult man to live with.
Oh, quite impossible.
I warned Judy, but she just laughed.
She thinks I'm worth it.
Are you?
No.
She's very much in love with you.
And now that
I've met you,
I'm beginning to understand why.
Are you?
Well, I can't.
I thank my stars for it, but I can't think what she sees in me.
You're...different.
You're blunt, almost rude.
You're honest.
That's rare.
And you're rather dashing and glamorous.
Oh, nonsense.
Oh, yes, that's your reputation, you have a name for bold deeds and wild adventures.
You fire the imagination.
Oh, yes, I can see what Judy sees in you.
Matter of fact, if I were her age,
I might...
You might?
That was very good sherry.
May I have some more?
Have the whole bottle!
Let's get tight.
I never get tight before lunch.
Let's have lunch together and get tight afterwards.
I'm a menace,
Mrs Miniver.
I love Judy,
I love her youth, her freshness, her naivete.
Her belief in all the things that
I no longer believe in.
But I'll probably make her a shocking husband, just as I did Pam.
Not that that was altogether my fault.
We used to throw things at each other, you know.
What sort of things?
Oh, anything that was handy.
Ornaments, books, gramophone records.
You have got a few of them left.
Are you saving those for Judy?
Ha! I hope it won't come to that.
Not yet, anyway.
Peace and quiet for a time.
Yes, but you're not a man of peace, are you?
I mean, you've no peace inside you.
That's why you're always fighting other people.
< You're really fighting yourself.
You really are an unusual woman.
Well, you're right, of course.
I've no peace inside.
That's why I make a soldier.
I don't give two straws if I die.
Oh, death can be easy.
It's living that's difficult.
That's been said before, too.
It's still true.
What did you fight about?
You and your wife.
Oh, please don't think that I'm just interfering or digging up the past, it's only that I'd like to be able to warn Judy about the dangerous topics so that she can keep off them.
Or perhaps she does keep off them automatically.
Does she?
As a matter of fact, she does.
That's because she doesn't know anything about them.
She's just a baby.
No, Pam and I used to fight about the maddest things.
Small things blown up into large ones?
No, large ones.
I thought I knew all about music.
She thought she was an expert on world affairs.
Who was right?
Both of us.
Always.
That's what made the whole thing so impossible.
She has a first-class brain, Pam.
And a wide catholic taste.
Her mind's as nimble as her fingers.
But she's the most infernally obstinate woman
I ever met in my life.
She's quite beautiful, isn't she?
The loveliest person.
But of all the obstinate, idiotic, pig-headed females!
You talked about the Greek, my Harry, the row we had about that!
You remember that cadenza in the first movement. Here.
The one that goes like this.
Lovely thing, isn't it?
You remember the theme?
That's the way it should be played.
The way it was written.
But that's not good enough for Pam.
She has to play it like this.
Now listen, listen to this!
See what I mean?
I'm afraid I don't.
They both sound the same to me.
All right!
You don't have to know the difference.
You're just a...
But Pam's an artist and a brilliant one, and to play the thing that way!
She adores Scriabine and Pergolesi.
I loathe Scriabine and Pergolesi.
And her taste in painting,
I ask you.
Raoul Mati.
Obscure French painter.
Picasso school.
Trash!
We paid 40 quid for that.
The second best art critic in town offered me 400 for it last week.
I still say it's trash.
These things are important to you, aren't they?
Music and painting?
Of course they're important!
There's nothing else left.
Then they're worth arguing and fighting about.
I mean, if you're lucky enough to find somebody who knows about them, who feels as strongly about them as you do, even if that person doesn't always agree with you.
Yes, it was exciting being married to Pam.
Never dull,
I'll say that for it.
Well, I don't think you'll have any trouble with Judy.
In fact,
I'm sure you won't.
As you say, she doesn't know the first thing about any of these things you've been talking about.
I don't mean that she doesn't like music and painting, but, well, you know, we're just an average family.
We like a painting to tell a good story.
Or music to have a good tune.
Something nice and simple.
So you see,
I'm afraid you will have to come down to her level, won't you?
Because she certainly won't be able to climb up to yours.
Well... goodbye, General.
It's been a fascinating quarter of an hour.
Shall I give your love to Judy?
Yes, thank you.
Thank you very, very much indeed.
Hello, Janet.
Mrs Miniver.
Oh, he's gone to lunch.
Just this minute,
I'm so sorry.
Perhaps I can catch him.
Oh, no, don't bother.
He's not expecting me.
It's a surprise visit.
He left early today.
He's taken the passports, you know, to the passport office.
Oh, then we're going?
I envy you.
Janet, tell me truthfully, is he doing this for me?
Well, he thinks you need a change.
Most people do, but they seem to manage without one.
You don't want to go?
No, no, I don't.
It's so far away from home and...
I'd rather...
I'd rather live here.
If you don't want it,
Mrs Miniver,
I think you should say so.
I mean, tell him the reason.
Whatever it is.
I can't do that.
That's the one thing that...
Besides, it isn't just for me.
He has a kind of desperate yearning to get away from this part of the world.
Oh, that? That's just the view from that window.
View from the...
Yes, I know it sounds silly, a little thing like that affecting a man, but it does.
I'm sure it does.
He comes in quite cheerful and bright in the morning, then he sits down over there, and within about 10 minutes, he sort of glooms over, if you know what I mean.
Of course we could look for another office,
I suppose, but I don't think he'd fancy the idea of moving.
Why, even when
Mr Blakner retired, he wouldn't move.
Janet.
Mrs Miniver.
It's all right, lady, it's a pleasure.
Thank you, lady, much oblige.
Ten bob each, OK?
All right with me.
How much did you get for it?
Old Blakie's office.
Well, it was just an old junk room.
You're not angry, are you?
I don't know.
I don't think so.
I've hardly had time to...
Hello. When did these come?
While you were out.
Are they good?
Are they good, Clem?
Yes. They're first class.
Somebody trying to put me out of business?
No. Somebody wants to come into the business.
Who did them?
You've been plotting.
The Foley boy, these are his, aren't they?
But they're good, Clem, you just said so.
You can't take that back.
I'm not taking it back.
No, well, don't try to.
Look, I can't take on an apprentice just as we're leaving.
We'll be out of the country within a month.
Good heavens, woman, if you loathe the idea so much, say so.
You want to get out, don't you?
Yes, I do, I do. The more
I sit here day after day looking out at that...
If you want to go, we'll go, darling.
Hey, come back here.
I want to talk to you.
No, not now.
Tonight at the dance.
Dance?
The sailing club dance.
Don't be late.
Judy?
Judy?
Darling, turn around.
I have something to show you.
Judy, it's for you for tonight.
No, thanks.
I'm not going.
Not going?
Darling, what is it?
Aren't you well?
Please don't touch me.
Judy.
Why? Why did you have to interfere?
It has nothing to do with you.
I loved him, he loved me.
We'd have been married but for you.
But for me?
Oh, don't pretend, please, don't pretend.
You were there today.
You went to see him.
Yes, of course
I went to see him.
You knew that.
I told you I was going.
I went to take his coat back.
That was just an excuse.
Yes, just an excuse to see him, but not to make you unhappy.
You've hated the idea of Steve from the very beginning.
I never hated Steve.
I liked him.
He asked me in and we talked.
And broke it off.
Darling.
Please, don't come near me.
I don't know what you said to him.
I don't care.
I only know that yesterday everything was gay and sweet and rather lovely.
And now it's over.
Finished.
Oh, how could you?
How could you?
Oh, Judy.
Oh, darling.
I didn't try to talk
Steve out of loving you.
I couldn't have, even if I'd wanted to.
Darling, he loved you.
He still loves you, my baby.
How could he help it?
But I'm afraid he loves his wife more.
That wasn't true.
Not till today.
I think it was true all the time.
He lost sight of her in the war partly because he found you in the war.
But the war is over, Judy.
"The war, the war."
Everybody blames everything on the war.
That's such a cliche.
A lot of cliches are true.
Well, I don't believe that one.
I do because I happen to know that it's true.
A lot of friendships spring up out of a war.
And they die when peace comes.
And it's right that they should.
What do you know about it?
I'd like to read you a letter.
It came two days ago.
It's from an American.
We had an awful lot of war together.
"My dearest Kay, this is the first time I've ever written to you with Ellen in the room."
Ellen is his wife.
"Kay, you remember our last evening together?
"Remember you said, you'll get the war out of your system sooner than you think.
"And when it's gone,
I'll be gone, too.
"I didn't believe you then.
"I've been home now several months and all that time
I haven't believed you.
"Because all that time, it hasn't been true.
"But now, quite suddenly, it is true, Kay.
"I'm home again with Ellen.
"Really home.
Home in my heart.
"Dear Kay, I know you never cared for me the way I cared for you.
"It was all on my side, so this won't be a hurt but a happiness.
"I love Ellen now as much as
I loved her before I met you.
"Maybe a little more because I did meet you...
"and love you.
"Goodbye, Kay, my dearest Kay.
"You were there when I needed you.
"I don't need you any more.
I'll never forget.
"I shan't try to now because now there's no danger in remembering.
"God bless you, always. Spike."
That's why I know.
I know what Steve felt for you, what he still feels for you.
It could happen and still not touch his love for his wife.
Spike never knew.
Never. And never will.
No-one will ever except you.
Will they, Judy?
Nobody!
Where is everybody?
What's this, a hen party?
This is just idle gossip, mother and daughter stuff.
Well, come on now, jump to it or we'll be late.
I promised Mrs Foley the first rhumba.
Second for you, Kay, and third for Judy.
That in order?
Well, er, Judy's going to bed.
She's got a headache.
I think I'll come after all, if you don't mind.
Mind?
Well, don't sit there messing about.
Come on. Somebody's got to tie my tie for me.
Hurry up, girls.
You know, there's something about a well-cut jacket you just can't mistake.
I was afraid the moths might have got into it.
New dress, isn't it, darling?
Oh, Clem.
It's six years old.
It can't be. Rationing hasn't been in that long.
Well, I wasn't entirely naked when it started.
I'd thought for a moment you might have stolen my coupons.
I did. And there's where they went.
And five of mine for the shoes.
Evening,
Mrs M. Evening, Mr M.
How about a sardine sandwich?
Mr And Mrs M, Mother.
Mrs Foley.
Hello, Tom.
What a lovely dance, Mr Foley.
And the food.
How did you manage it?
I suppose we'll all suffer for this next week.
Half a dollop of marge instead of the usual two mouthfuls.
Oh, no, nothing like that.
Things are looking up.
Everything will be back to normal any day now.
He's been saying that every day since peace was declared.
Well, there's no harm in hoping, Mother, is there?
She misses the bombs.
Well, at least they made you feel you were alive.
Oh, Tom,
I've got something for you in the car.
Don't let me go off with it, will you?
Something for me, sir?
Yes, your sketches.
What did you think of them, sir?
Well, I think that probably you'll put me out of business.
That is, if I don't take you into it.
How about it? Do you think you can spare him, Foley?
Aren't you leaving us?
I heard you were bound for foreign parts.
You mean you want to take Tom with you?
Yes. I want Tom to come with me, but only as far as London.
Do you think you can manage that?
Trains run every half-hour.
Then Brazil is off?
Hello, darling.
Oh, Clem.
Did you say something, dear?
Monday morning, 10.30.
9.30, sir.
I'll tell you how to get to the office.
I'll tell him, Father.
You've only been there once in your life.
I'll tell him.
Mother.
Don't forget our rhumba.
Happy about everything?
Completely happy.
Dance with me?
Kay?
Yes?
Where are you?
I'm here.
But you look miles away.
Come back, will you?
I'm here, darling.
I was just thinking.
I have to tell you something.
Now?
Yes, Clem, now.
It's hot in here.
Let's go outside.
All right, darling.
Our ninth anniversary.
Tenth. '18 to '28,
10 years.
'18 to '46?
28 years.
'46 to '56 to '66 to '76.
We'll be like old man river.
We'll just keep rolling along.
Clem, you don't mind about Brazil?
I belong here.
We both do.
Then you'll stay here? Always now?
Of course. If that's what you want.
We might slip away to the sea for a fortnight in the summer.
What do you think?
Yes.
As long as we're home by autumn.
I want to be home for autumn, Clem.
It's important.
Why is it important to be home for the autumn, Mrs Miniver?
Because next to the spring it's the loveliest time of the year.
And I...
I won't be here for the spring.
What does that mean, exactly?
My darling, my darling husband.
'She gripped my hands, gripped them tight till it hurt.
'And then, she told me, while the music played and the moon shone,
'and old man river, he just went rolling along.
'Kay told me that night that when the autumn was gone, she'd be gone, too.
'I heard her voice,
I knew what she was saying.
'But standing there I seemed more aware of absurd, irrelevant things -
'an owl hooting on the other side of the water,
'somewhere inside on the dance floor, the tinkle of glass,
'one of the little fairy lanterns overhead flickering on and off.
'She stopped speaking and looked up at me, waiting.
'I felt a touch on my sleeve and then her voice.'
The last dance, Clem.
'Somehow, I found my feet
'moving automatically back onto the floor.
'I remember thinking,
"They're playing that thing from Annie, Get Your Gun."
'Strange how music bridges the years.
'Showboat and Annie, Get Your Gun.
'20 years of married life.
'And so we danced.
We didn't speak. Not a word.
'What was there to say?
'We just looked at each other.
'And loved each other.
'And danced.'
Clem.
I won't let it happen.
It shan't.
We'll find something, somewhere.
We'll go on till we do.
There's America, the whole world.
We'll go all over the world to the ends of the earth.
I know there's something!
I've seen everyone.
The best.
The very best.
But there must be something, something we can do.
There isn't, my dearest.
There isn't.
I didn't tell you until I knew.
There's nothing that anyone...
They say that it was the war, and then after.
You have to be pretty tough these days, and I wasn't quite tough enough.
You know.
You do know, don't you?
How much I...
I've loved you?
Darling, I know.
We've had one of the rarest things in the world, a perfect marriage.
Nothing has touched it and nothing can break it, ever.
"Mr And Mrs Clement Miniver
' "request the pleasure of your company
' "at the marriage of their daughter,
Judith Diana Elizabeth
' "to Thomas Henry Foley at
St Margaret's Church, Belham." '
Take thee,
Thomas Henry...
Take thee,
Thomas Henry... to my wedded husband... to my wedded husband... to have and to hold from this day forward... to have and to hold from this day forward... for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer... for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer... in sickness and in health... in sickness and in health... to love and to cherish... to love and to cherish... till death us do part... till death us do part... according to God's holy law. according to God's holy law.
And thereto, I give thee my troth.
And thereto, I give thee my troth.
Well, Charles.
Thank you once again.
You did us proud.
They're a charming couple.
They go well together.
So, by the way, do you.
The first leaves.
You know, I often think that England is like a certain type of woman, at her loveliest in the autumn.
Goodbye, Mrs Miniver.
'He was right.
'As I put an arm around her and we walked back together into the house,
'I realised Kay had never looked more beautiful.'
I think it all went off rather nicely, don't you, darling?
I'm so glad it was fine for them.
It's been a beautiful day, Clem.
Something to remember.
I'll be down in a moment.
'Four years ago.
'Four years ago today.
'The house is still here.
'And we're still here, the Minivers, if you chance to be passing this way.
'Tom and Judy in our old room,
Kay's and mine.
'Toby, when he's not at school, and I.
'Kay isn't here any more.
'I mean, you can't see her.
'But she's here.
'For me, close to me, she'll always be here,
'in a thousand places, a thousand ways.
'In the house, in the garden...
'everywhere.
'It's like that if you love someone.
'If you love them enough, nothing can touch your love, nothing can threaten it.
'You go on together, for ever.'
Despite the Hôtel des Invalides originally being a retirement home... for the most severely injured war veterans, the makers of this film... have concentrated only on the part housing the museum.
They didn't feel able to deal in a single documentary, with the important social and medical issues raised by the veterans... in defence of their institution.
Hôtel des Invalides founded in 1675 by Louis XIV as a hospital and retirement home for war veterans.
Guarded by a "triumphal battery" of
12 cannons called the "twelve apostles" the edifice was built after the plans of the architect Libéral Bruant.
Designed by Mansart, we have here l'Église du Dôme, facing south.
Above the romanesque colonnade the dome is topped by a lantern with four sides.
The sparrows of the Invalides.
The pigeons of the Invalides.
The skylights of the Hôtel are surrounded by sculptured trophies.
The most important representing the coat of arms of Louis XIV's minister.
"Le Loup Voit"
"The Wolf Sees"
From this mansard we can see
The Place de la Concorde and the bridges over the Seine.
L'arc de Triomphe and the tower of the engineer
Alexandre Gustave Eiffel which surround the Hôtel des Invalides where are housed those gravely wounded and the illustrious fallen.
Legends have their heroes and war its victims.
Here the army has its museum.
The remains of the old artillery.
A beautiful yet... terrifying work of art, from the "Vert Galant" era.
Some of these poor looking devices amuse the visitors, however... if we measure the dangerous development of an industry which grows like a poisonous fungus we must realise that this is no laughing matter.
Here is the first section of the Musée de lArmée
The display of armour
This way,

His glorious deeds still exciting the fields of battle and illustrated in this painting by Éduard Detaille which has inspired the popular song
"La Rêve Passe"
Out on the Plain the weary soldiers now are sleeping
Lulled to slumber while the evening breezes blow
From the field the smell of new mown corn is creeping
And the sentinel is pacing too and fro
Then all at once the sky is filled with shapes of horsemen
Lit up by lightning as the dying day goes down
And the famous white horse is directing the course
To renown...
See them pass on, those hussars, those dragoons, and guardsmen
They all salute...
The Emperor who watches them
Ladies and gentlemen, would you follow me please

STATUES ALSO DIE
When men die, they enter into history.
When statues die, they enter into art.
This botany of death is what we call culture.
That's because the society of statues is mortal.
One day, their faces of stone crumble and fall to earth.
A civilization leaves behind itself these mutilated traces like the pebbles dropped by Petit Poucet.
But history has devoured everything.
An object dies when the living glance trained upon it disappears.
And when we disappear, our objects will be confined to the place where we send black things: to the museum.
PORTRAITS OF ANCESTORS
UTILITARIAN ART /
UNKNOWN ORIGIN
UNKNOWN ORIGIN
Black art, we look at it as if it had its reason for being in the pleasure it gives us.
The intentions of the black who created it, the emotions of the black who looks at it, all of that escapes us.
Because they are written on wood, we take their thoughts for statues and we find the picturesque there, where a member of the black community sees the face of a culture.
AFRICAN MASKS
It is its smile of Reims that she gazes upon.
It is the sign of a lost unity where art was the guarantee of an agreement between man and world.
It is the sign of this gravity which delivers her, beyong métissage and the slave ships, that ancient land of the ancestors,
Africa.
Here is the first division of Earth.
Here is the fetus of the world.
Here is Africa in the 11th century.
12th.
15th.
17th.
From age to age, as its shape slowly unravelled,
Africa was already the land of enigmas.
Black was already the color of sin.
Travellers's tales spoke of monsters, flames, diabolical apparitions.
The whites already projected onto the blacks their own demons as a way to purge themselves of them.
And yet, once beyond deserts and forests, which he believed to be bordering on the kingdom of Satan, the traveller discovered nations, palaces.
Which song cradled this little princess?
This little orange ripened in the caves of Benin?
Which cult presided over this little republic of night?
We don't know any more.
These great empires are now dead kingdoms to history.
Contemporaries of Saint Louis, of Joan of Arc, they are even more unknown to us, than those of Sumer and Babylon.
In the last century, the flames of conquerors turned this whole past into an absolute enigma.
Black upon black, black battles in the night of time, the sinking has left us only with this beautiful striped wreckage which we interrogate.
But if their history is an enigma, their shapes are not foreign to us.
After the Frisians, the monsters, the helmeted Atrides of Benin, all the vestments of Greece over a people of a sect, here are their Apollos from Aifé which strike us with a familiar language.
And it is fair that the black feel pride about a civilization which is as old as ours is.
Our ancestors can look at each other face-to-face without looking down with empty eyes.
But this brotherhood in death is not enough for us.
It is much closer to us that we are going to find the true black art, that which puzzles us.
The enigma begins right now, here, with this poor art, this art of hard wood, with this plate for divination, for instance.
It is not very useful for us to call it religious object in a world where everything is religion, nor to speak of an art object in a world where everything is art.
Art here begins in the spoon and ends up in the statue.
And it is the same art.
The wisdom in art and the ornament of a useful object like the head support and the useless beauty of the statue belong to two different orders.
Here, this difference falls apart when we look closer.
A chalice is not an art object, it is a cult object.
This wooden cup is a chalice.
Everything here is about cult.
Cult of the world.
When he makes the chair rest upon human feet, the black creates a nature in his image.
Hence, every object is sacred because every creation is sacred.
It recalls the creation of the world and continues it.
The broadest activity cooperates with the world as a whole where everything is fine.
Where man affirms his reign over things by imprinting his mark and sometimes his countenance upon them.
Animal shapes like the one over this weaving bobbin, plant shapes like the ones over these ornamented boxes, all of creation moves in formation under the fingers of the black artist.
God showed him the way, he imitates God and this is the way in which he invents man.
Guardians of graves, sentinels of dead people, watchdogs of the invisible, these ancestors' statues are not made for the cemetery.
We put stones over our dead in order to prevent them from escaping.
The black maintains them nearby to honor them and benefit from their power, in a basket overflowing with their bones.
It is the dead who own all the wisdom and all the security.
They are the roots of the living.
And their eternal countenance takes, sometimes, the shape of a root.
These roots flourish.
The unvoluntary beauty of animals and plants shines in a girl's face.
And we can take its light for a smile, or else its glow for a tear, and feel touched, on the condition of knowing that these images ignore us, that they are from another world, that we have nothing to do in this gathering of ancestors who are not our ancestors.
We want to see suffering, serenity, humor, when we know nothing.
Colonizers of the world, we want everything to speak to us: the beast, the dead, the statues.
And these statues are mute.
They have mouths and don't speak.
They have eyes and don't see us.
And they are not so much idols as toys, serious toys which have no value except for what they represent.
There is less idolatry here than in our saints' statues.
Nobody worships these severe dolls.
The black statue is not the God, it is the prayer.
Prayer for motherhood, for the fertility of women, for the children's beauty, it can be covered with ornaments which have the value of illuminations.
It can also be rough, like this earthen ball protecting the harvest, or, still, connected to the earth, to death, by means of shape and by means of matter.
This is the world of rigour, each thing has its place within it.
These heads don't have to be frightening, they have to be fair.
Look carefully at their scars, this magnetic field where every shape from sky and earth comes into being.
There's no need for the object to exist and to serve.
This overflow of creation, which deposits its signs like shells upon the smooth wall of the statue, is an overflow of imagination, it is freedom, turning of the sun, flower knot, water curve, fork of the trees, one after the other, the techniques are mixed, the wood subtly imitates the fabric, the fabric takes its motives from earth.
One realizes that this creation has no limits, that everything communicates, and that from its planets to its atoms this world of rigour comprises by its turning the world of beauty.
A god made these gestures.
The god who wove this flesh taught them by its turn to weave the cloth and its gesture sends back every second to the weaving of the world.
And the world is the cloth of the gods, where they received man.
Try to distinguish here which one is the Earth and which one is the cloth, which one is the black skin and which one is the Earth seen from an airplane, which one is the bark of the tree and that of the statue.
Here, man is never separated from the world, the same strength nourishes every fiber.
Those fibers, among which, the foremost sacrilege, lifting the Earth's skirt, has discovered...
...death.
Beast's mask.
Man's mask.
Mask which participates of both beast and man.
House-mask.
Face-mask.
Pierrot of the rivers.
Harlequin of the forest.
These masks fight against death.
They unveil that which it wants to hide.
Because the familiarity of the dead leads to the domestication of death, to the government of death by means of spells, to the transmission of death, to the charming of death by means of the magic of shells.
And the sorcerer captures in his mirror the images of this country of death, where one goes by losing one's memory.
But, winner of the body, death cannot do anything against the vital strength spread through every being and which composes its double.
Through life, this double takes sometimes the form of the shadow or of the reflection in the water and more than one man gets angry for being hit right there.
But death is not only something one bears, it is something one gives.
Here is the death of an animal.
Where has the strength which inhabited this hand gone?
It is free now.
It wanders.
It will torment the living until it has taken on its former appearance.
It is to this appearance that the blood of sacrifice is addressed.
And it is this appearance which is fixed in these legendary metamorphoses in order to appease it until these winning faces are done repairing the fabric of the world.
And then they die, in their turn.
Classified, labelled, conserved in the ice of showcases and collections, they enter into the history of art, paradise of the forms where the most mysterious relationships are established.
We recognize Greece in an old African head of 2000 years;
Japan in a mask from Logoué; and still India;
Sumerian idols; our Roman Christ; or our modern art.
But at the same time it receives this title of glory, black art becomes a dead language and that which is born over its death is the jargon of decadence.
Its religious requirements are followed by commercial requirements.
And given that the white is the buyer, given that demand outstrips supply, given that it is necessary to go fast, black art becomes indigenous handicraft.
Each time even more degraded replicas of the beautiful pictures invented by African culture are fabricated.
Here, the village is vulgarized, the technique is impoverished.
In the country where every form had its signification, where the gracefulness of a curve was a declaration of love to the world, one becomes accustomed to an art of bazaar.
These fake jewels, which the explorers offer to the savages in order to please them, end up being sent back to us by the blacks.
The particular beauty of black art is substituted by a general ugliness.
An art where the objects become bibelots, a cosmopolitan art.
An art of the flower-pot, the paperweight and the souvenir pen-rack, where one sees, transparently, the Tower of Babel.
Also an art of portraits.
Henceforth incapable of expressing the essential, the sculptor seeks after resemblance.
We taught him not to carve farther than the tip of his nose.
But that which we make disappear from Africa doesn't count for much among us compared to what we have in store.
That's because we are the Martians of Africa.
We disembark from our planet with our way of seeing, with our white magic, and with our machines.
We cure the black of his diseases, it is certain.
He catches ours, it is certain as well.
Who loses and who wins in the exchange has been of no concern whatsoever.
The magic devised to protect them when they die on their own account is powerless when they die on our account.
Against the Christian paradise and the lay immortality, the cult of ancestors evaporates, the monument to the dead substitutes for the funeral statue.
All of this dominated by the whites, who see things from their heights, which rise above the contradictions of reality.
From these heights, Africa seems orderly, rich, covered with people from modern cities, filled with its concrete igloos like white blood cells of civilization.
From such heights, Africa is a wonderful laboratory where it is possible to partially prefabricate the kind of good black dreamt up by the good whites.
Then all this protective apparatus which gave sense and form to black art dissolves and disappears.
It is the whites who intend to take on the role of the ancestors.
The true statue for protection, exorcism and fecundity hecenforth is their silhouette.
Everything unites against black art.
Caught in a pass between
Islam, enemy of the images, and Christianity, which burns idols,
African culture collapses.
In order to lift it up again, the Church attempts a métissage: the black-christian art.
But each of the two influences destroys the other one.
And this flawed wedding makes Catholicism in Africa lose its exuberance, its glow, everything that blacks, indeed, anyone had recognized in Europe.
Temporal power practices the same austerity.
All that was pretext for works of art is replaced be it clothing, symbolic gestures, intrigues, or talking.
One says "yes, yes, yes".
Sometimes, one says "no"!
There, that is the black artist who says it.
And so a new form of art shows up: the art of fighting.
Art of transition for a period of transition.
Art of the present time, between a lost greatness and another to conquer.
Art of the provisional, whose ambition is not to last, but to witness.
Here the problem of the subject is not posed.
The subject is this naturally ungrateful earth this naturally troublesome climate and inside work, at an unfathomable scale, the rhythm of the factory confronting the rhythm of nature:
Ford meets Tarzan.
The subject is this black man, mutilated from his culture and without contact with our culture.
His work is able to provide neither spiritual nor social sustenance, he works for nothing, his reward is nothing but a derisory salary.
Into this country of gift and exchange, we have introduced money.
We buy the blacks' work and we degrade it.
We buy their art and we degrade it.
The religious dance becomes spectacle.
We pay the blacks to give us the comedy of their joy and their fervour.
In this way, by the side of the black-slave, appears a second figure, the black-puppet.
His strength serves us, his prowess amuses us, on the side, he serves us as well.
Nations which are endowed with racist traditions find it all the more natural to trust to men of color the concern for the nation's olympic glories.
But a moving black is still black art.
And in sport the black can find, hoping for the best, a good terrain for mystifying the white's pride.
The white does not always appreciate the joke.
It happens that he cries "foul" when things are turning out bad.
If a black boxer manages to defeat a white one in a country marked by
Hitlerian racism they try to break him down with blows of menacing insults and projectiles: he had better stay in his place.
And when it's no longer for play, when the blacks, for instance, join the labor struggle, it's the blows of guns and batons that break up the demonstrations.
This climate of premeditated menace drives the black artist into a new metamorphosis and, in the ring, or in an orchestra, his role consists in returning the blows that his brother has received in the street.
And witness here, far from the appearances of black art: for the art of communion, the art of invention finds accomodations within this world of loneliness and the machine.
The man who had impressed his mark upon things accomplishes now empty gestures.
What we have is this, from the bottom of this loneliness, that which will create a new community.
Black art was the instrument of a will to grasp the world and also of the will which undertook to change its form.
Look well at this technique, which frees mankind from magic.
It presents sometimes with magic a strange relationship of gestures.
It is always against death which one fights.
Science, as magic, admits the necessity of the sacrifice of the animal.
The virtue of blood.
The harnessing of malevolent forces.
The sorcerer captures images every day.
And death is always a country where one goes forth at the cost of one's memories.
No. We are not redeemed by shutting off the blacks within their own celebrity.
There would be nothing to prevent us from being, together, the inheritors of two pasts if that equality could be recovered in the present.
Less remarked, it is prefigured by the only equality denied to no one...
...that of repression.
Because there is no rupture between African civilization and ours.
The faces of black art fell off from the same human face, like the serpent's skin.
Beyond their dead forms, we recognize this promise, common to all the great cultures, of a man who is victorious over the world.
And, white or black, our future is made of this promise.
THE END
"The producer, showing these documents to the public, without holding back nor hiding anything, would like to warn of the violence and cruelty of certain scenes.
It is all part of a particular solution to the problem of readaptation, the film shows, indirectly, how some Africans see our occidental civilization."

Film made during a mission (project) of the NATIONAL SCIENTIFIC CENTRE...
 - and the FRENCH INSTITUTE of BLACK AFRICA
Coming from the scrublands to the cities of "black africa"
- young men are confronted with mechanised civilisation.
Hence are conflicts and new religions born.
Hence, since around 1927, has developed the cult of the Haouka.
This film shows an episode of the life of the Haouka from the town of Accra.
It was shot by request of the priests.. proud of their art, 
Mountyeba and Moukayla.
None of the scenes is forbidden nor secret
 but open to those who want to play along...
And this violent game is nothing .. but the reflection of our civilisation.
Accra,
Capital of the Gold Coast, is the true Black Babylon.
Here, you will meet men from all parts of West Africa
Nigeria,
Niger,
Haut Volta, Sudan.
They have come to live the great adventure
- of African cities.
Here, traffic never stops.
Here, noise never stops.
The most interesting group in Accra may be the Abrama Community.
They are: Sonray; and Djarma, from the North , from Gao and from Miame.
They work as stevedores in the port.
"Smuguly", Smugglers.
"kayakaya", Carriers.
"Grass boys", Manufacturers of Tropical Lawn.
"Hygiene boys", Mosquito killers.
"Cattle boys", Cattle traders in the great Markets
- of Accra in Kumasi.
"Bottle boys", Empty beer bottle sellers.
"Tin boys", who sell and take petrol drums.
"Timber boys", Selling timber.
"Gutter boys", Who tend the gutters of the cities.
"Goldmine boys", Who work underground. and -
By day and by night, in the bars
"Weekend in California!", "Weekend in Havana!"
- you can hear the calypso, from the west Indies.
Every Saturday and Sunday there are.. people in the streets.
These are Yoruba's celebrating a wedding.
These are roused up prostitutes, protesting against lowering wages.
These are "Daughters of Jesus" singing their faith in the streets.
All this noise, all these Brass Bands, yet these men have come from the North, from silent savanas, to seek some peace in the suburb of a city.
And there, every Sunday night they go to ceremonies, not yet known to us.
They call on The New Gods.
Gods of the City, The Gods of Technology,
The Gods of Power: The Haouka.
The meeting place of The Haouka, in Accra, is in The Salt Market.
There, members of the Sect meet every noon after work.
They gather round Muykayla-kiri
Muykayla of the Salt.
They pretend to read a paper, by Guyeba, with his checkered shirt.
And those who have not been possessed for some time sleep on the couch, falling asleep to the guitar playing the tunes of the Haouka.
One Sunday morning, in many wagons,
Trucks, which pick up passengers, private cars or Taxis..
All the members of the sect leave the city.
They drive off the main road onto one, which is perhaps, the first tarmac road in West Africa.
These days it is overrun by grass.
Then they walked for an hour, to get to Muntyeba compound.
Muntyeba: A man from the Niger, a cocoa farmer and the High Priest of all the Haouka.
Coloured rags, flutter in the sky they are ... the 'Union Jacks'.
Just below is a statue of the Governor with his moustache, his sword..
..his guns and his horses.
The first part of the ceremony, is the nomination of a new member.
This man has been sick for a month.
For one month, he has one problem after another.
He sleeps in the cemetary and
- digs up the corpses.
Everybody knew:
That this man is possessed by The Haouka.
He is not yet entitled to wear a pith helmet.
In two or perhaps, three months, he will be initiated when he has to be.
But for the time being, he has simply been nominated.
He takes out two wooden guns which he strikes together to imitate the noise of gunshot.
He threatens the Elders.
Then begin the posessions.
Another one, confused, is rushed on him to beat him because that is the initiation.
They separate them, but the new initiate is hurt badly.
The nomination is over.
A new Union Jack is hoisted...by Muntyeba.
The second part of the ceremony is the Public Confession.
Around the concrete altar, the guilty Haouka must confess their wrong-doings.
One Says: 'I have had intercourses,
- with the girlfriend of one of my friends'
'-and for two months, have been impotent!'
Another Said: 'I never wash, I am dirty!'
'I am not elegant!'
And another says:
'I don't care about the Haouka!'
'Sometimes, I even feel they don't exist!'
One member is fined a Ram and a Chicken.
When the whistle blows, the Haouka's form two lines ...
The penitents on one side and the others facing them.
One of Muntyeba's assistants holding the sacrificial chicken swings his arm to and fro to tell the Gods:
'we give you this chicken, never in front, nor in back.'
The blood is poured on the concrete altar and on a termite hill, previously painted black and white to represent The Governors Palace.
The Penitents come before the blood drenched altar to take The Great Oath.
They swear not to do it again
'if we do it again, we ask our Haouka to finish us - by DEATH.'
Then the Penitents are sent outside the compound.
They will have to be possessed before they are allowed back into the Holy Circle.
In the spirit of purification,
Muntyeba makes a libation of Gin.
He pours it over the olive trees, the poles which holds the Union Jacks, and on the Governors Palace.
On the Governors Palace, a telegram.. movie poster for "The Mark of the Zorro" above, is the Secretary General.
Here is where Muntyeba keeps the Sacrificial eggs.
The sentries, Mountain Guard and Muntyeba break the eggs over the steps, and balconies of the Governors Palace.
It is ten in the morning, it rains.,
A one string fiddle is playing The Haouka tunes.
Men are waiting.,
And Muntyeba has gone to sleep... resting his head on the Governors Palace.
They are waiting for a dog.
Why a dog?
Because, it is a strict 'taboo' and if The Haouka slaughter a little dog.. they will prove, that they are stronger than you and me, whether black or white.
The guns and red sashes are gathered around the altar.
The guns are arranged, to get ready for the sacrifice.
Then starts the dancing.
Muntyeba is the first to dance for ALL the Haouka must be possessed.
The sentries surround the dancers, they carry the guns, and the whips -
(made out of Fan Belts).
Guyeba, one of the penitents, wants to join the dancers.. but he's not allowed to since he is not yet possessed.
Muntyeba chases him off into the bush.
The Impotent man has also ran out and sentries are placed all around the compound.
Striking their wooden rifles together and stopping the penitents.
Other sentries watch over those who are going to be possessed, aiming their rifles at them, in standing-up prone position... and the trance starts,..slowly.. in the left foot, then, in the right foot,. it travels upward..to the hands, arms, shoulders
- up to the head.
And the first man possessed gets up-
He is Capra Haidi, the corporal of the Guard.
He salutes everyone.
Then he asks for fire, fire to burn himself with to prove he is no longer a man
- but a Haouka.
When saluted, one of the other men shouts:
(It's Djerba, the one of the penitents
-who was in the bush)
Djerba is possessed by the Haouka known as 'Sankaki', -'The Train Engineer'
The Engineer pulls up his shorts and gathers all the rifles to carry them to the altar, for the sacrifice.
The Captain of the Guard is now wearing his red sashes.
And the third Haouka rises.
He is Captain Malia,
The Captain of the Red Sea, who does a slow march:
The parade march of The British Army.
Here, again the Train Engineer.
And here is the fourth man seized, he is Madame Lokotoro.
Acting coy, Madame Lokotoro, the Dr's wife, recieves a womans dress.
The corporal of the guard goes on, saluting everyone.
And the engineer shuttles back and forth between the Governors Palace and the altar.
This one is Lieutenant Malia -
The Lieutenant of the Red sea.
Breathing becomes heavy, eyes turn white.
Next, the Governor is reaching the climax.
The Lieutenant calls for help and the Corporal of the Guard comes to the assistance of the Governor.
The governor is standing, he speaks French and insults everyone.
He calls his Lieutenant and his Lieutenant makes a sign, meaning -
'I hear you, but I'm not here yet!' and the Lieutenant stands to salute the Governor.
A woman has fallen on the ground..
She is Magasia, the Queen of the Accra prostitutes
She is possessed by a she demon-'Madame Salma'
Madame Salma was a wife of one of the first
French officers to come to Niger at the end of the last century.
Madame Salma is now wearing a pith helmet and a dress.
She inspects the new statue of the Governor and the Lieutenant breaks an egg on the Governors head.
Why an egg?
To imitate the plume worn by British Governors on their helmet.
Here he is the real Governor, at
'The Trooping of The Colours' in the opening of the Assembly in Accra.
Guns salute and, amid the crowd,. there are Haouka dancers looking for their model.
And, if the order is different here, from there:
The protocol remains the same.
The Generals' staff are gathered together to inspect the Governors Palace.
The Corporal of the Guard stands at the entrance and the Governor and Lieutenant check the fresh coat of paint on the building
Muntyeba, the man in charge, is worried if the Governor complains he will be fined a sheep or even a steer maybe.
This man dressed in blue, is possessed by the General.
The Governor insults the General and the man gets into a rage and says 'I am going to bring the General back'
The General gets really furious and says
'It's always the same!
No one will listen to me: The General!'
Then the Governor invites him to a roundtable conference.
The General calls his Orderly Syobo Tuymuku, nearly knocks himself out, then he gets up and comes to pay his respects, with the General.
The other men who were in the bush are now possessed, and they come out.
The Secretary General,..
Maimota the truck driver, and Major Mugu (The Wicked Major).
The Wicked Major comes to pay his respects to the General,
Who then orders him:
Burn yourself! As the others did.
Show that you are really The Wicked Major
The Major takes a very small torch as the General insults him and asks for a larger one.
The Major takes it and sets fire to his rayon shirt!
Fire won't burn The Wicked Major.
Then the Governor calls together another roundtable conference.
It is a conference of the dog.
All the Haouka are now gathered and the dog is to be slaughtered, and eaten up.
The Captain would like to slaughter the dog
..but finally, Muykayla-kiri the White Priest cut the dogs throat in order to avoid accidents.
The Governer says: 'Keep Quiet!'
The General says: 'Keep Quiet!'
And hardly has the beasts throat been cut that the Haouka walk forward to drink the blood or lick it off the altar stone.
Madame Doctor starts cutting up the dog.
The Captain places Sentries and then demands a new conference.
The problem is: whether the animal is eaten raw or cooked?
'Nobody listens to me!' Says the General.
'It's always the same!'
He insults his soldiers and finally manages to get the meeting going.
The Captain tells the Governor -
'We must cook this dog, so that we can take pieces to those who could not come'
Maimota the truck driver suggests that he will transport the dog and the Governor says 'Haouka! Look!..'
'I shall teach you to carve a dog before you cook it'
The Wicked Major gives the Governor some tips
Then, the Major says to Muykayla-kiri, the White Priest,
'We must bring back bits of the dog, to those who didn't come'.
'And also some of the Dog Soup'
Meanwhile, the Train Engineer is pacing back and forth between the sacrificial altar and the Governors Palace.
As soon as the pot is boiling, the Haouka who are near the fire or boiling water, dip their hands straight into the cauldron to fish out pieces of stewed dog.
The Wicked Major obtains the best piece:
The head.
The train Engineer, eats an ear.
The most looked for pieces are also the vísceras
The Haouka are fighting... to get the best pieces.
Bits of cooked dog are wrapped in banana leaves and empty bottles are filled with Dog Soup.
It's getting late.
Trucks and Taxis have been hired for the day, and if the feast's not over soon,
'night fares' will have to be paid. so one by one, the Haouka move away.
The assistants guide them to the Governors Palace, where the trance is nearly over.
However, Guyeba the Engineer refuses to leave, they have removed his ceremonial garb but he stays on and calls out to Muykayla-kiri (The White Priest)..
He says 'Muykayla! Muykayla! This years festival was a GREAT SUCCESS INDEED!'
'The next year we must have TWO festivals!
..and we, The Haouka, will be very pleased'.
And thus, from one festival another is born.
And even the Train Engineer
...finally goes away and night falls on the red rags, dirty clothes and the Governors Palace.
The day after, we went to see the Haouka at work, in Accra...
In the salt market, the White Priest still rules (Muykayla-kiri) and one after the other the Haouka's join him.
Here comes Major Mugu (The Wicked Major) who maybe has resumed a conversation he started yesterday with Muykayla
But today, the Major is no longer Impotent! and his girlfriend is very happy.
And not far away.. another roundtable conference is being held here. but this time, the point is not whether to eat a dog raw or cooked, but simply, to play cards.
Madame Lokotoro (the Drs wife) is to be found in a Penjabi shop.
Madame Lokotoro, is a rather effeminate boy who uses a lot of hair vaseline but, as a shop clerk, is excellent.
The Corporal of the Guard owns three trucks and holds a Gravel monopoly of the Accra Traffic Department.
The Lieutenant is a pickpocket!
He awaits his 'customers' and also he hands out cards for the
West African Trading Company.
The General, in real life, is just a Private.
And by chance we find the Generals' staff from yesterdays ceremony in front of the mental hospital of Accra.
The Governor, the Train Engineer and the Truck Driver- all three work for The Accra Waterworks.
Those who, like Guyeba, were doing penance, have shaved off their hair and are no longer impure.
And when looking at these happy faces, and being told they are the among the best workers of the waterworks department.
When comparing the smiles with the contractions of yesterday, one really wonders, whether these men of Africa have found a panacea against mental disorders.
One wonders whether, they may have found a way to absolve our inimical society.

THE ONLY WAY OUT
Directed by:
The movie was filmed in
Postojna Cave (Slovenia).
During World War II, German occupying forces used the cave to store nearly 1,000 barrels of aircraft fuel, which were destroyed in March 23, 1944 by Yugoslavian Partisans.
This story was losely based on that event and any similarity with real persons was accidental.
For the first time, we have to be careful about the object we are about to demolish.
We have a strict order not to use too much explosive in the Cave.
Because it is a wonder of nature.
-It would make a nice tomb for us.
Seems that the fuel is stored in some unimportant part.
We are here.
The Germans have walled up the passage.
That's why they don't guard it.
But there is an underground river here.
Some parts, called siphons, are completely submerged.
The fuel storage is 4 miles away, at the tourist entrance.
Do we know the quantity?
-Approximately 50 wagons.
Has anyone of you been in the Cave?
I know only the entrance near the railway.
Maybe we have to go through the undercurrents. -Why through there?
Better that we go through this hallway. It is faster and safer.
Damn, this is a nasty action.
Four men in the dark with new commander.
We should think of men.
I've told you already that the passage has been walled up. -We will break through.
No one has ever passed through the undercurrents. -I know that.
I'm going to see the security officer.
We go as soon as I come back.
You shouldn't talk to the commander like that.
I just don't know what came over me.
Let's forget about it.
I was with Maria last night.
She asked me where I would go.
I didn't want to tell her.
She told me: "Watch yourself!"
Why would she tell me something like that? -She loves you.
Have you ever loved someone?
Not as much as I should have.
When you are with a woman, you wish the war is over.
You know, her fingers are...
...long, long as blades of grass.
I was a master shooter with marbles, when I was a kid.
This one doesn't count.
Let's go over there to smoke our cigarettes.
You go. I'll smoke here.
So, white bread diet again?
I wish it is white.
We have a little time left, let's smoke our cigarettes.
Let's wait for the commander.
Let's not!
Who knows what the new one is alike.
And this I will stash away.
This way, at least my tobacco would be dry.
Hand me the lighter.
It is reliable, but almost empty.
Down there, you have 50 wagons of fuel, you could use.
If we live in some other time, now it would be a proper time for a prayer and confession.
But, since we are, what we are, let everyone thinks what he wants.
Look at Jozha. He still smokes.
It must be that you come up with something. -Me?
This time - nothing.
I don't like this rain.
The undercurrent will raise up.
Rudy, you cigarette butt is the shortest and my the longest. It means something.
Means what?
-Nothing. I was joking.
Four butts - all grouped together.
Everything ready?
Yes, for now.
Our mission is crystal clear: the fuel must fly sky-high, or our asses are on the line.
Stay together.
If someone gets lost...
-...let him yells: "Ooya!"
Be careful and agile.
We must go through water.
Have you protected the explosive?
Silly me! You have been in many similar missions, haven't you?
Depends. Most of us have been in more than 30 missions.
And you, comrade commander?
OK, let's smoke a cigarette now.
We have done that already, comrade commander.
Is that so?
Now he knows about our cigarettes.
-Ah...
Good start!
Keep the necessary distance.
Jozha...
Come out, comrades!
I played this for you.
Are you insane?!
Acting like a fool!
I just wanted to check electric installations.
Don't be afraid.
They cannot hear us.
The fuel storage is a couple of miles from here.
So, this means that the Germans can turn on the lights in the Cave.
No, not the entire cave at once.
This switch, turns the lights on, 200 yards behind us, and this one,
200 yards in front of us.
The tourist bureau was thrifty, taking care about economical use of lights.
You mustn't do it again without my approval. Understand?
Yes, comrade commander.
They built a strong wall, as we predicted.
Let's try to break through.
Shorty, let's start!
-Wait!
Impossible. A concrete wall.
Who knows what's behind it.
And they could hear us.
Explosion could crumble the hallway.
Going through the underground river would be insane.
It has been raining for days.
The water level must be high.
Make a decision.
I was told that there was one siphon through which we might be able to pass.
It's our only chance.
Let's go.
This newbie doesn't want to hit the wall...
...with his head.
Let's go.
Take care about the explosive and protect your flashlights.
Jozha and me, we are going ahead.
You three wait here.
When you hear my whistle, you come along.
Wait here! Commander and
Jozha have gone to see around.
Give me the matches.
I don't have it.
I don't know where I put it.
Wait! The water is rising.
It has risen a lot.
We shouldn't go any further or we would drown.
Stop talking! Hurry up!
How would we go back?
The same way.
Only faster.
The Germans will chase us.
Come on, Rudy!
-Don't you see the water level?
We have a new commander.
What is he going to think about us?!
And now what?
And if that is 50 yards long?
You're insane! I won't go!
I won't commit a suicide!
Who doesn't dare, just go back.
Be my guest.
We've slipped through.
The shore is near.
Good work, comrades.
We've managed to get here for less than a half of hour.
I doubt that we would be able to penetrate the wall in that time.
Jozha?
-Huh?
What about the explosive?
- Everything is in order.
Tomo? -The same.
Even the cigarettes are dry.
We can smoke a cigrette now.
-I would prefer a snack.
Here, Rudy... Have a smoke.
If you have finished your cigarettes, we can move on.
Should I go ahead with a flashlight?
I would choose this way.
-I don't think so.
I don't see anything on this chart.
But I do not agree with you.
-Comrade commander...
This passage is narrow and has a dead end, I'm sure.
I think we should go that way. The
Germans has probably walled up this one.
Germans did not built another wall.
No discussion any more!
Follow me. We don't have much time.
Hollow and rings like a bell.
He pretends to be a wise guy, huh?
-He is sure that he knows.
You're gonna spent your flashlight, comrade commander.
We will try your way.
We are wasting our time. We should have broken through that wall.
What are you trying to say?
-Nothing.
Then stop talking!
If you have soiled your pants, don't go!
-I shouldn't have come!
Enough! Go back!
He's gonna destroy us, for sure.
Turn off that lamp.
Why are you looking at me?!
Let me be.
Turn off the light.
Jozha.
Jozha!
-Huh?
What is this?
-I don't know.
Probably some lights from one of the halls.
We are still far away from the entrance.
This is probably "Concert Hall".
Rudy and Shorty stay with the gear.
The rest of you, follow me.
Shorty...
Listen, Shorty...
"Turn off the lamp.
What are you looking at!"
Now we have turned off everything.
Tell the Krauts to turn off, as well.
There are 3-4 guards.
They have a kitchen there.
They have a radio, as well.
What could that be?
Some sort of a guard exchange post.
Maybe that is the storage.
Impossible. The storage is much deeper, behind the bridge.
Let's eliminate them.
Eh, Tomo...
Three Krauts doesn't worth 50 wagons of fuel.
Go back and bring those two and the gear.
Shorty, forgive me, please.
I don't give a damn.
Forget it.
I'm dreaming.
I see a bright sunshine of Africa.
-Why are you talking about sunshine?
No reason.
Just wanted to tell something.
I'm sick of all these rocks.
I wish I could see a daylight, just once more.
Don't worry.
You'll see it.
A man could be afraid of some weired things.
Could be, but mustn't be.
C'mon, the commander is calling.
According to this chart, we should go through this hall.
Yes, this is "Concert Hall".
It's a shorter way.
Now we have to take a longer detour.
We just have to reach the railway.
I recognize this part of the cave.
Can you...
Can you find the detour?
-Yes, I can.
We have to cross over a hill.
I think they call it... uhm...
They call it...
Calvary, or something like that.
We move. Absolute silence.
And now the Calvary!
In the name of the Father, the
Son, and the Holy Spirit. Amen.
Oh, Jesus Christ, your torment is upon us now.
Little fish...
Little fish.
Nice little olm.
What a nice little olm.
Don't be afraid. Come here now.
Are you a fish... or a man?
Little fish. Little fish.
Why are they shooting?
-Maybe they saw us.
Impossible. They would light up the cave and sound the alarm.
Forget it. Move on.
Come and get it!
Hey!
Put out the cigarette, now!
Calvary.
Shorty...
I've decided.
I can not stand this uncertainty any more.
As soon as we reach the target,
I will go into action. -Why you?
The commander will choose.
-He must choose me!
You mean, because of this.
What's he saying?
-Nothing.
Give him the lighter.
He doesn't have any matches left.
This one is not for everybody.
I'm gonna steal it, for sure.
After the war,
I will make a lighter like this.
Yeah, just go ahead.
I'll keep this one, for now.
Pay attention now!
What is it, Jozha?
I've found the detour.
And the railway is close by.
One route leads back to the bridge, and the other, straight to the entrance.
This has been like a tourist walk, so far.
Now it's over with tourism.
Keep quite and alert.
So, here you are, birdies!
And now the showtime.
What a beast's lair!
It's OK, comrades.
We predicted something like this.
It is the entrance, so there will be no significant damage if we blow it up.
This will make a nice little fire.
-Keep quite and get to work.
Jozha, keep watching the guards.
-Yes, commander.
Shorty, you will go and...
-...and me.
All right.
Tomo and Jozha will cover us.
In the case of a fight, we shall not retreat until Shorty and Rudy return.
I'll fix it to explode in a half of an hour.
Half an hour?
No. Two hours.
We need that much to escape.
I'm going to have a closer look.
A bit too cautious, our new pal.
He could say two days.
Who knows. Maybe he's right.
Yeah, why not...
I'm so tense, I could explode myself.
Stop whining!
If you had a britches, you would have soiled yourself.
Not that one!
Use a chemical fuse, you bungler!
You always think only how to fill your belly.
You're lucky to be with us, so no one would know.
No, not that one.
Use the other one, instead.
Their garrison is full of soldiers.
I don't know about this side.
Don't worry. When they reach the cave, we will be far away.
Are you planning to stay?
Taking your boot like that.
I wouldn't do that.
-Something pinched me.
Don't do that, bro.
They could smell your stinking feet.
-Quite!
If they spot me, you should eliminate the guards.
Don't worry, Rudy.
Light me.
Hey, gimme that!
Later. Now I know that you will cover us properly.
Here. Take this to comfort you.
Well... Ready?
We're ready.
Let's go!
Stay hidden and don't turn any light.
Yeah, now I wish to be a bat.
It is mined!
If they spot them, shoot in the searchlight.
See, it's only a cat.
-Yeah and we almost open fire.
Come, kitty, kitty...
If they spot me, I'll start to meow.
Come to me, kitty.
Someone is there!
We can forget the explosive now.
They will find it.
I'll light up the fuel.
Give me the lighter. -I'll do it.
Give it to me! -We'll go together.
-Go back!
Cover me!
Rudy will light up the fuel.
We have to wait for him.
Rudy!
It's burning!
Rudy! Over here! Rudy!
Here! Take this, Krauts!
Rudy!
Rudy! Shorty!
Shorty!
Rudy! Where are you?
Rudy!
We must go back!
Try to awake him.
The Krauts could be here any second.
Is he wounded?
-I didn't see any wound.
Probably just a concussion.
Strange that they haven't turn on the lights. Maybe damaged in the explosion.
What about him?
Nothing yet.
I hope that they would not cut us off.
-The flame has blocked the way for Krauts.
Nevertheless, we don't have much time.
What's going on? Where are we?
Shorty! Shorty!
Rudy!
Oh, it's you. Where is Rudy?
Shorty, can you stand up?
Are you wounded?
-I don't know.
What about Rudy?
-In such a flame, even stones burn.
What? You left Rudy behind?
-You called him. Did he answer?
I didn't see him fall.
-What do you think?
I thought I saw him running. And then it exploded, and I passed out.
Listen, Shorty...
Give me a straight answer:
Are you sure that he is alive?
Maybe he crawled under those moist rocks there.
We cannot hesitate any more.
We completed the mission.
Who did complete it?
He did complete the mission!
What could we do?
-Let's try to find him!
Wait!
Krauts!
Go back!
Here.
Get moving. Go!
Wait!
They go back.
-It's Rudy!
What are you trying to say?
He's alive!
-How do you know that?
You don't know that.
-How do you know that?
Take it easy.
We don't know why are they going back. -It is clear why.
Only five of us entered the cave.
Dogs can smell live and dead people.
So, this is how you think.
If the Germans don't start to shoot, then... -Then what!
To sit here and wait?
-Yes, damn it!
Or would you rather take us to attack them?
We did everything we could.
What sort of a man are you?
I haven't heard a single shot.
Would it be better if you did?
Maybe they have captured him.
Rudy would never surrender.
What if he was unconscious, like me?
We couldn't do anything about it.
-Why not?
We were sitting here like some old ladies. -I'm going alone! -Stop!
Stop right there! What makes you think that you are better than the rest of us.
We've been in trouble many times before and we never left a man behind.
Enough!
They are going to the bridge.
Why did they return to the storage?
-Why did they come here in the first place?
I don't know.
-I do.
Listen.
My orders were to complete the mission and to save the men. And you want to ruin us!
Retreat! That's an order!
Hurry up! Or they would cut us off.
They are coming. Fire!
Go cross over the bridge. Hurry!
Comrades! This is my fault.
Go, cross the bridge.
I will cover you.
Go now!
I'll shoot better if I'm alone.
Go after him.
I order you to go!
This is my fault. I'll cover you.
I give the orders around here!
-But, commander...
Go, when I'm telling you.
Soon, it would be too late for both of us.
This one is for Rudy!
Fuck you!
Shorty!
Watch yourself, Shorty!
Comrades...
I'm only holding you...
-Don't talk, Shorty.
Throw some grenades.
Keep them there.
This was all my fault.
Don't talk now.
Lucky for us, the siphon is not too long.
Maybe they are still here in the dark.
Sergeant!
Collect this as an evidence.
-Yes, sergeant.
Comrades!
Comrades!
Comrades!
The dawn is near.
The sky is clear.
This will be a beautiful day.
Yes, it's a daybreak.
Any moment now.
Go and bring a stretcher.
I regret...
I've kept Tomo's lighter and I wouldn't be able...
...to return it to him.
We'll put you on a stretcher.
You will feel better.
Stars...
Like marbles...
It is not good to remember...
Forgive me...
I was rude with you.
Well, you know...
New commander...
I understand. Don't talk now.
You need to rest.
It was my fault.
I put you all in jeopardy.
Forget it.
Don't talk about it.
Who knows who's fault was that.
Don't be angry with me...
...but I still think that Rudy is alive.
I would like to smoke a cigarette with you...
Shorty. Shorty.
Shorty!
Shorty!
Shorty!
Take him down to the checkpoint.
Leave the gun. I'll follow you.
Tomo...
He asked me to give you this lighter.
Thank you, comrade commander.
Rudy!
Rudy, it's me.
Hurry! They are going to the wall.
We will go through the understreams.
Finally!
Let me go first, this time.
What about the others?
-All out and safe.
I wonder...
What is it, Rudy?
You wanted to ask me something.
I wonder why Shorty isn't with you.
He couldn't come.
Is he badly wounded?
We carried him.
He didn't suffer for long.
It was during the night and he said:
"It will be a beautiful day."

The digital restoration of the Italian version was carried out using the best elements preserved by Cinecittà Studios and CSC - Cineteca Nazionale.
An in-depth analysis of the materials, along with the valuable contribution of film historian Adriano Aprà, allowed the identification of the most useful restoration elements.. the internegative for the picture, an intermediate for the opening titles, a positive copy taken from same colour internegative for the sound, and a vintage showing print for correct synchronisation.
The images were scanned at a resolution of 2K.
After scanning the images were stabilised and digitally cleaned to eliminate the marks of time - spots, lines, scratches and splice marks.
The colour correction process turned out to be extremely complicated, as the colour had greatly faded.
A vintage copy, preserved by, CSC
- Cineteca Nazionale and a copy printed by Cinecittà in the 90s were to be of high reference value during this phase in rediscovering the specific characteristics of cinematographer Aldo Tonti's work, as well as the various film used
(Gevaert, Ferania, Kodak, 16mm, 35mm).
Following its digitization, the film's soundtrack under went digital cleaning, as well as the reduction of background noises caused by wear overtime, maintaining the dynamic nature and particularities of the original sound.
All of the elements traced are lacking some frames in certain parts, thus it was not possible to reconstruct the entire film.
The restoration was carried out by
Cineteca di Bologna at L'Immagine Ritrovata laboratory in 2011.
For anyone coming from the West, Bombay has traditionally been the gateway to India.
On arrival one is filled with euphoria.
The first thing to astonish is the crowd.
Tens, hundreds, thousands tens of thousands hundreds of thousands maybe millions of people, who come together like the incessant current of a river which yet hasn't swept away the vestiges that the Muslims,
Parsis, English colonialists and others constructed.
Sun, shade, winds drought and monsoons have given a common appearance to these people of diverse races and religions. which thickens and swarms.
Farmers and city dwellers.
Then there are the old castes: the Brahmins, custodians of religion, the Kshatriyas, warriors, the Vaishyas, merchants, the Shudras, workers.
The castes were formed according to ethnic group - the indigenous, Dravidians and Aryans, as well as Persians, Muslims and all others derived from such a concentrated mix.
The hum of countless languages rises from the swarming streets -
Hindustani, Bengali,
Assamese, Oriya, Gujarati,
Marathi, Kannada, Relugu, Malayalam,
Tamil, Brahui, Sindhi
Punjabi, Rajasthani,
Pahari, Bhili, Kashmili, Bihari.
A confluence of peaceful peoples and of warriors become peaceful.
These men with gold, turbans are
Ismailis ancient Muslim warriors once known as hashishin from which the word "assassin" comes.
The Ismailis are now a hardworking, peaceful community.
This patchwork of humanity, this promiscuity of elements makes up the Indian people, the most tolerant in all the world.
They even tolerate this architecture.
But they do try to improve it.
This tolerance prepares their souls for all transformations and changes, without racial prejudice or sacrificing their various ethnic characteristics.
This crowd enjoys itself like all the crowds in the world.
Merry-go-rounds, spin toys, street performers, balloons windmills.
And they happily relax.
They are skilled craftsmen.
Whom this crowd lifts carries bears hoists up, loads holds up,
Moves transports, transfers and relocates.
It strolls ruminates sleeps, dreams builds works adopts the most modern methods or makes use of traditional means.
The Indian people are supported by millenniums of tradition, and openly prefer peace to war, tolerance to intolerance.
A people who don't want to convert anybody.
But the most authentic Indians live in its 580,000 villages.
On just one twentieth of the earth's surface lives one sixth of the world's population.
This dramatic reality is the motor of modern India.
The Indian is aware of nature.
He knows well he's part of it.
He knows the secrets, the laws the fruits and how to change them.
Here in the temples the images of life appear as a great celebration.
A full and delicious expression of a people's love for life.
A sacred city, Madurai shows off the majestic architecture of its temples.
This elephant was brought to the city for a religious ceremony.
It comes from this immense jungle of Karapur where it works, where it once lived in the wild where it was captured and domesticated.
The elephant is the bulldozer of India.
The Indian is so at one with nature that through kindness instead of force he was able to make the elephant into his work colleague.
An elephant works just three hours a day, from 7 to 10.
Then it becomes too hot for him.
Instead us mahouts the elephant drivers, don't get a moment's rest all day.
After work, bath time.
And believe me, it's quite a job.
I need to cool him off for two or three hours.
Splash him, rinse him, wash him down, cuddle him caress him, and finally pick the fleas off him.
After bath time, breakfast.
An elephant eats between
600 and 800 kilos a day.
Of course, it depends on the animal's height and size.
After he's been well fed we can finally have a bite to eat.
During breakfast one day we were joined by a company of puppeteers.
I remember it very well.
That was an important day in my life.
Sir, is there a guest house around?
We are from Mysore.
We are here to put on a puppet show.
We are looking for a guest house.
The guesthouse is on the other side.
- Where?
- Over there.
Thank you. Let's go.
We don't even have time for a little amusement.
At night he needs to be fed 100 to 150 packs of straw with rice or grain, and more caresses and cuddles too.
What a life!
The next day I saw her again.
These bellows for us who know elephants well, signify that they're falling in love.
I'd be so happy.
It's the only way I'm able to have some free time.
Hopefully it's serious.
At the beginning I'm always afraid.
The female elephants have somewhat less modesty. the males however are quite shy.
They have, I'm sorry to say, more dignity.
Early afternoon after bath and breakfast, they must be left alone in the jungle.
They're timid, very timid.
Modest, very modest.
I saw her again.
Next day I brought the elephant under the same tree for breakfast.
And again the following day.
I made an appointment with the teacher to have him write a letter a nice letter to my father, that he come ask my marriage to the girl.
- What do you want?
- I'd like some help.
What for?
To write a letter.
To whom?
To my father.
What do you want to say?
Something nobody must know...
...regarding the puppeteers.
The girl, isn't it?
Yes, it's a serious matter.
If you write it for me, it'll bring me luck.
Let's begin with -
"Dearest Father
I send you my fondest greetings.
I'd be very happy if you'd come here.
I must speak with you about my wedding. "
Yes, that's fine.
The letter must have been well written as a few days later, returning from work,
I found my father waiting for me.
I thought of my hat.
It's a Muslim cap worn by mahouts, but since I'm Hindu not Muslim
I said to myself,
"My father won't tolerate it. "
He's a man of principles and always treats me like an eccentric.
It's important to start a family, but one must reflect well first.
Come, be seated.
He met with the girl's father.
And respecting tradition, both spoke badly about their children.
This is the boy's father.
Tell me.
I want to talk about our children.
My son has seen your daughter and wants to marry her.
Both my son and I have jobs.
We have some land and do well for ourselves.
This is sufficient for our children's tranquility.
Let God's will be done.
We'll tell the priest about the ceremony.
The marriage was arranged in accordance with the rules.
And that night my father and I went to the temple to wait for the wedding.
Until that moment, as is our custom
I wasn't permitted near my fiancée.
She arrived at the temple on the morning bus.
Ten months have passed.
The female elephant's starting not to stand the male's presence.
This always happens when an elephant is ten months pregnant.
As you know, their gestation lasts twenty months.
Another female, sensible and patient, comes to protect and assist her.
As far as I'm concerned it's again the end of my freedom!
I had to ask a neighbor to accompany my wife to her mother's house.
I won't have time to look after her she too is expecting a child.
With her great rivers, all India has its roots in the feet of the Himalayas.
All the snow that melts on the roof of the world, represents for 400 million human beings... life.
From the water blooms the calm beauty of lotus flowers.
Everything particularly beautiful or useful is particularly sacred.
Toward death the common feeling is that each man dies but does not end because he's reincarnated as another.
But no one can say as whom.
Therefore, all men are brothers.
In "Shanti Parva" a Brahmin tells a man crying for his dead son,
"You are despair itself, for you don't despair for yourself, but for someone else. "
The canto also says,
"I think that my own soul does not belong to me, but all creation belongs to me, and in virtue of this certainty
I am never too happy nor too sad. "
The Ganges is the river that purifies everything, and dissolves into nature the ashes of the dead.
Benares the sacred city descends steeply to the sacred banks of the river.
Inside the city life swarms incessantly.
In front is the placid passage of the water indifferent to the buildings it is swallowing slowly.
This is the Mahanadi River almost parallel to the Ganges.
It's an example of the force of nature.
No bridge can resist the furry of its waters when the monsoons agitate them.
People have tried to control this furry.
In Mahabharata, the epic Indian poem, specifically in "The Gita," the book dedicated to the philosophy of life, it's said that every word one speaks and every action one makes remain forever before us like images reflected in a mirror, and judgement won't be pronounced till afterwards.
It's also said: "The wise and the ignorant are equally happy,
Unhappy are the mediocre people.
The truth is in everything, even, though partially, in what is not true.
Karma - action - represents the duty of man.
There's been constructed at Hirakud a dam 43 kilometers long.
They're constructing the access roads.
There's been formed an immense artificial lake whose level rises every day.
The treetops remind us that once the jungle reached to here.
At the worksite, there were about
35,000 of us.
It was hard, yes.
But we did it.
Seven years of work.
For me the time flew by.
Pick stroke after pick stroke.
Basket of earth after basket of earth.
One stone after another.
We dug, drilled, leveled, built.
So much!
And today:
I, Devi Chakravarty, am here waiting outside the foreman's office.
My wife's weeping because we have to leave.
Our son was born here and so...
Here the work is finished.
They've assigned me to another worksite.
They always need people like me.
Next!
- What's your name?
- Devi Chakravarty.
Ah, here are the papers.
You'll be working in Mandira.
Thank you, sir.
This is your certificate.
This is the letter of recommendation.
- You have done a good job here.
- Thank you. I'm very proud.
Next!
Stop, please!
Take this and go home.
Let's go.
Incredible how much stuff we needed!
We had the best of everything... tools, trucks, equipment.
It's incredible! So many things!
Yes, I think it's a real reason to rejoice, having constructed a dam like this.
Now it seems like nothing.
People say, "They built a dam. "
But no one imagines what it was like.
In fact I understand my wife.
It's sad to leave behind all this.
But she doesn't think about what we can do now.
After all, there's not just one dam to build in life.
175 dead.
Before however, with the floods if you wanted to build a monument to all the victims you'd have to make one as long as the dam to inscribe all the names.
Electricity, electricity.
Magic, magic.
Everything can be explained, everything.
You have to think, to think.
There's no more magic, no more miracles. Knowledge!
No more magic, no more mystery.
Knowledge. Knowledge.
Hirakud Dam.
One truly has a right to feel proud.
All done from nothing.
One basket of earth after another.
One stone after another.
And heart.
Yes, we put our hearts into it.
Poor brother.
Death is sad for those who stay.
Perhaps it's beautiful to dissolve into nature.
I, Devi Chakravarty, with my wife, found asylum here, when we were thrown out of East Bengal, due to the separation with Pakistan.
Here our son was born and here we set out to build this immense work.
This little temple will be swallowed up by the water too.
With all due respect, what, after all, is this little building compared to our dam?
Our sacred lake will now be lost in the big lake.
Who'd have thought then, when I took my ritual bath here, of the surprise destiny had in store for me?
Who could have thought that men like us would be able to create a lake where there was a little pond?
There she is.
Where are you?
What are you doing?
Let me alone!
What do you want?
What are you doing here?
I looked for you everywhere.
Your head is always in the clouds.
You come down here when we're about to leave?
I don't understand you.
Why not eat some more?
We're full!
We'll explode!
We're not the only ones...
No, thank you, we must get up early tomorrow.
Goodbye! We'll meet again.
Look after them.
Can't you see they're standing?
Please, have a seat.
How's your family?
Very well, thank you.
Write us. Don't forget us.
Stay a little longer.
- You're going?
- I must go home.
Write to us as well.
Remember us.
Why are you just standing there?
Let's tidy up a bit.
Careful not to trip!
Our farewell party went well, but now I must endure her whining.
Another town, who knows how it will be?
I'm fond of this house and the nice people here.
Suddenly I have to leave everything.
This is my destiny, never to have peace.
We left our village, our field and it's not over yet.
I told you many times to try to stay here.
But this man never listens to me!
He's cold as a rock!
He has no pity.
Where will I go live now?
To Hell?
I came here.
I had a child.
I raised him.
To leave this house this marvellous dam...
To end up where?
Oh, it's awful!
My heart is breaking!
Instead, this man has a heart of stone!
I told you to prepare our things!
Go! Move it!
And so, we leave.
Going up the west coast of India, one crosses vast plains, rich with water particularly favorable for cultivation of rice.
There isn't a square metre of land left untended.
India once had her fortresses.
Here's an old Muslim citadel with double walls and quadruple doors.
Nowdays nothing remains inside but a tiny village.
The old mosque is abandoned.
Strange geologic architecture.
I am 80 years old.
I've always lived here, and yet, this forest has still for me its fascination and its secrets especially at night when it resounds with the fantastic love songs of the tigers.
The jungle is the temple in which are celebrated their rites of love.
When I awake with the first rays of the sun, there's all around me a whole explosion of joy.
I and my wife don't need to exchange many words.
It's enough, our gestures, our looks, to express our unalterable, daily solidarity.
It's a long time, moreover, that our daily duties have been shared.
What more to say?
My two sons are married.
Every morning one of my daughter-in-law brings flowers for the habitual homage to God.
My wife, like all of us, is very devout, and every morning thanks God according to tradition.
Hey, Rama! What are you doing?
Come here.
Go to that cowshed, milk the buffalo and then clear the cowshed.
I can no longer work because of my age.
My place has been taken by my sons.
For me nothing's left but to give them some advice.
The only thing still left for me is need for the contemplative life and for this there's only one place in the world that can satisfy me, the jungle.
I love my cows, they're beautiful, strong beasts, and I always bring them with me.
The women always have the same jobs to perform.
I, alone in the jungle, feel intensely the presence of nature, and I feel little by little to be merging into it.
There's a fair in the village of Sume.
Can I go with Rakhma?
I've met often this tiger that lives here.
See how foolish men are myself first of all!
I can't manage not to be afraid, though I know she won't do anything.
She walks away indifferently.
One day I was in the jungle with my cows.
I remember I wanted to light a cigarette.
Smoking is the only weakness
I still have.
Suddenly I heard a strange noise.
There were three trucks.
Out of curiosity
I went towards the village.
What's going on?
They're getting iron.
There's lots of iron.
We'll get some work.
They were prospectors searching for iron deposits.
I'd often heard people talk about iron, but I think it's just a legend.
The next day the men with the trucks started up a motor, and it was a real disaster.
That din chased all the animals out of the forest.
Only the porcupines, stupid selfish animals, remained.
But the jungle changed face.
From then on I felt that the natural balance had been disturbed.
Very soon I had to realise how much that event had been dramatic.
I found the remains of a porcupine and the bloodied tracks of the tigress.
Not finding other prey, she'd pounced and been wounded by those terrible quills.
That discovery frightened me.
I know how dangerous wounded tigers can be.
That's the moment when they become man eaters.
That roar and that human scream during the night was a terrible sign.
What I feared had happened.
The tigress had attacked a man.
The next day in fact my sons told me the iron prospectors had decided to organise a tiger hunt.
Why kill?
The world, isn't it big enough for everyone?
The next morning I thought I'd get into the forest before the hunters.
I tried to convince the tigress to go elsewhere.
Yes truly, the world is big.
There's room for everyone.
Sometimes there are heat waves.
The temperature rises dizzyingly.
The only thing to do is take refuge in water.
The roads are abandoned.
The rivers become the paths.
In the villages, life is almost paralysed.
A sky of steel.
Certainly it was one of these heat waves that surprised Dulic as he travelled with his monkey Ramu, to the festival of Baghdedic.
Ramu the monkey has arrived alone in Baghdedic.
In the middle of the people she does what she's used to.
She collects coins she doesn't know the use of.
The wild monkeys threaten her because she smells of man.
The next day the pilgrims leave for their villages.
Ramu is left alone.
At the end of her strength, she's been picked up by a new master.
And Ramu starts now a new life.
And there continues the community existence which mixes in daily symbiosis: goats, multitudes of goats, sheep, herds cows people, trees fatigue, honors private life, collective leisures large crowds, crowds in movement machines trades.
Even the birds descend into the streets.

This is a story, simple but dramatic.
The story of the men who crew our ships: the seafarers.
Every seafarer will recognize in what follows, something of himself: familiar scenes, the faces of the men who share his calling, his way of life, and maybe something more - call it a dream fulfilled.
I'm Don Hollenbeck.
Joseph Conrad wrote a lot of things about the sea, and among other things, he wrote this:
"The true peace of God, begins at any spot 1000 miles from land."
And here's something else 
I came across the other day that interested me very much:
"Ever since the days of sailing ships, seafaring has drawn to it men of many different types.
And yet they have one thing in common, these men. 
It's the quality that makes men want to live not in a city, or in a town,
 but in the world.
It's a true spirit of independence, and it's always been
deeply rooted in the seafaring tradition."
And now to go on with this little essay, nobody knows better than a seafaring man,
that any man, however independent he is, isn't entirely independent.
He's a member of something larger: of a family, of a community, of a nation.
Or, bring it back to seafaring; he's a member of a crew, a crew of men like himself, banded together for one essential common purpose.
Now the picture you're going to see now, is the story of men who are banded together 
for one essential common purpose. 
This a vital story in their daily lives, and their achievements.
It's a proud story, made possible by the deeds of seafaring men.
 It's the story of the S.I.U.
From Vancouver, along the Pacific coast, around the great curve of the Gulf of Mexico,
up the rim of the Atlantic from Tampa to Halifax, in every major North American port, close by the waterfront, there is a headquarters of the of the Seafarers International Union.
This is headquarters for the 
S.I.U. Atlantic and Gulf district,
more than just a building, a solidly impressive symbol of what seafarers have achieved. 
And like every S.I.U. headquarters, the heart of this one is it's hiring hall, run by seafarers, for seafarers.
In this S.I.U. hall, as in others, seafarers can pick berths 
on ships of many types, going almost anywhere in the world: 
Antwerp, Cape Town, London,
Marseille, Singapore.
 You name it.
Picking his destination is the right of every seafarer, and sometimes, more than a right, a duty.
In the great seafaring tradition, a duty voluntarily assumed.
Every true seafarer respects courage, the courage of men of all national origins and religions, that has created seafaring tradition and built the S.I.U.
A seafarer coming ashore in any U.S. port, no longer needs to feel cut adrift, as many once did.
He has a place to go. 
A union hall, built by seafarers to meet the needs and suit the tastes of seafarers.
Big, modern, efficient and safeguarding the rights and interests of those who go to sea, but never forgetting that the machines and the files and the figures are there to serve the seafarers
and not the other way around.
Staffed by experts but under the supervision of men who know what it is to top a boom, to batten down a hatch, to weigh an anchor.
Financial statements posted weekly in every port for seafarers to read. 
And an S.I.U. printshop turns out regular bulletins and reports, airmailed to seafarers on S.I.U. contracted ships around the world.
A good seafarers headquarters has to begin where others leave off, for seafarers coming ashore in a port away from home it ought to be, and is, a second home, where no man off a ship is a stranger to the rest,
and where the things he needs are close at hand.
Like this S.I.U. cafeteria,
open to the public, but mainly for the convenience of seafarers.
Lots of space, lots of good, inexpensive food.
The galley, well stocked and well scrubbed.
A pleasant sight after any voyage is the S.I.U. barbershop,
another of the many conveniences at S.I.U. headquarters.
The S.I.U. sea chest, which meets S.I.U. contracted ships
in every U.S. port with ship and shore gear, takes orders, makes deliveries from
S.I.U. warehouses in S.I.U. trucks, maintains this headquarters store for those ashore with some refitting to do.
The S.I.U. is port of call, from the figurehead on the ship-shaped bar, to the faces of men you have shipped with.
A friendly spot for seafarers ashore to spend some time, to relax, to meet shipmates, or to bring some friends.
But the hiring hall, through which every job on every S.I.U. ship
in port is filled, is the center of it all. 
Here, seafarers get their jobs not as a favor, but as a right, in the order in which they apply for them.
When a seafarer registers for a berth he gets a registration card. 
The card, filled out right in front of him, is stamped with a number
marked with the date of his application. Then this information:
name, job classification, date and number, is typed onto list which is posted in full view. 
When two or more seafarers throw in for the same job, the one with the registration card showing the earlier date
and lower number gets it, and any seafarer in the hall can check these for himself.
What's more, a seafarer can pass up a berth because he would
rather work another type of ship, or one headed for his favorite ports, without losing his place on top of the list.
Shipping call is every hour, on the hour, but there's no standing in line or idling on a sidewalk in between.
A seafarer waiting for a ship, doesn't have to kill time in S.I.U. headquarters, he can enjoy it.
He can shoot a game of pool.
He can shoot the breeze, write a letter, read a book.
Or play some cards.
He can try his hand at one of these games.
Or take a look at works of art by fellow seafarers,
carvings and paintings done abord ship. 
Some good enough for any gallery.
And for those staying ashore a while there's a S.I.U. school.
Well, we've pretty much covered that subject. 
All of us have had our say, and we come to the next question, that is "what does a union mean to you?".
George.
I'd say protection on the job, security.
It means the boss can't shove me around.
Anyone else?
Denis.
The big thing is how you take home pay.
And overtime along with the penalty pay, buys a load of groceries.
Any other ideas?
Yes, Paul.
I look at it this way: 
I see other guys doing things together, I want to be part of it.
Being part of this group, the S.I.U. provides benefits of many kinds to the seafarer and his family, when he is likely to need them most.
All of them financed by company contributions required by 
S.I.U. contracts, and costing seafarers not a cent. 
You can sum these benefits up in one word: security.
The security seafarers gain by working together in their common interest.
For example there's a maternity benefit of $200 to help a seafarer and his family.
Plus a $25 dollar bond for baby.
And later on, the children of seafarers have a chance at S.I.U. college scholarships. 
Seafarers become eligible for vacation pay after every ninety days they've worked.
And in the S.I.U., as every seafarer knows, there is no red tape, this whole operation takes
5 minutes, or a little more.
The S.I.U. never loses sight of the fact that it exists to serve it's seafaring members in every way it can, wherever they may be.
That is why seafarers created the S.I.U..
Every hospitalized seafarer knows at least once a week an S.I.U. representative will come by to say hello, to fill personal requests.
And pay the S.I.U.'s weekly hospital benefit of $15 in cash.
And this goes on for as long as the seafarer is hospitalized; weeks, months or years.
For disabled seafarers or those too old to go to sea, the S.I.U. weekly disability benefit of $25, comes in handy.
Seafarer's gains through the S.I.U. have been won step by step in victories on ships of Isthmian,
City Service and other lines.
Through the solidarity of seafarers themselves, backed by the S.I.U.. 
Of one S.I.U. victory in a major tanker fleet, a senate committee said:
"It is amazing that any union could survive this heavily financed, lawyer-led attack."
But winning through the democratic process of collective bargaining is an S.I.U. habit.
As these headlines from its newspaper, the "Seafarer's Log", show.
The "Seafarer's Log", often called the country's best labor paper, is airmailed to S.I.U. ships everywhere,
keeping seafarers informed of S.I.U. progress.
Progress such as this:
Shipping lines under contract up from 8 to 84.
S.I.U. assets up from less than
$100,000 to close to $3 million.
Cash benefits to seafarers now running into millions.
Seafarers' earnings tripled through
S.I.U. contracts. Impressive, isn't it?
With the best contracts in the maritime industry, the S.I.U. 
makes sure that seafarers get the full benefit of those contracts.
An S.I.U. representative goes abord all incoming ships to represent the crew in ironing out all grievances, claims and disputes, before the payoff.
This S.I.U. representation assures every seafarer that he will be paid off in full. 
A seafarer's union, in doing its job, must meet and service its members abord ship.
The S.I.U. brings its services to its members, not waiting for the members to come to it.
Working onboard ship, every seafarer knows that his job, his rights on his job, and his rights and interests ashore are fully protected through his cooperation with other seafarers, 
not only in his crew, but in his union.
This explains why
S.I.U. organizers, when they approach members of unorganized crews, get a friendly welcome.
And real cooperation in providing S.I.U. support for those who want the benefits of S.I.U. membership.
Membership in the union that represents seafarers effectively
because it is controlled by seafarers in the democratic way.
 All officers of the S.I.U. are elected. 
No one can be a candidate for S.I.U. office unless he has spent at least 
3 years at sea, a guarantee that he will understand seafarers' problems.
On ship and on shore, all S.I.U. policies are decided by the majority vote of seafarers, with plenty of time for discussion.
Every S.I.U. meeting begins with a statement reminding seafarers of the rights guaranteed them in the S.I.U. constitution.
Calling on them to exercise those rights. 
The right of any seafarer to nominate himself or any other seafarer as a meeting officer or to any committee. 
The right of any seafarer to speak his mind on any issue.
The right to vote on every issue.
The right to straight talk from S.I.U. officers.
Listen to Paul Hall,
Secretary Treasurer of the S.I.U. Atlantic and Gulf district.
For the Chairman, Officers of the meeting, fellow seafarers. 
You have heard in the previous part of this meeting, our organizers made the report that we have petitioned a very large unorganized company for the purpose of representing their employees for collective bargaining reasons.
You know as I do, that the seamen of that particular company are going to vote in our favor.
Those men are going to vote in our favor because they know what kind of a union that we are.
They know the things that we represent, they know the things that we want to do. 
They know, for example, that in this union we have the most fair, democratic system of hiring ever known to any American industry.
They know, too, that we have in this organization the most democratic constitution in the trade union movement, whereby no decision can be made to affect our people, unless that decision is made on the floor of meetings just such as these.
They know too, that this organization has the finest agreements ever negotiated in the entire maritime history.
They know that the seamen under those agreements are the highest paid seamen in the world.
They know too of our many broad benefits that we have for our people, they know of the payments we make for hospital benefits, vacation benefits, they know too that disability, regardless of age, when you can't work in this organization you are put on a pension so that you will be taken care of.
They know of the death benefits, they know of the maternity benefits. 
They know too of the fact that we have scholarship benefits.
The men in that particular fleet also realize that we have a tremendous economic strength here, an economic strength that enables us to be protected against the boss, if such need arises.
They know too that while we do possess such large economic strength, that we do not abuse that strength.
The S.I.U.'s economic strength, used effectively but without abuse, has meant much to seafarers; security, a higher standard of living, a position of respect in their communities.
Today, every seafarer beginning a voyage goes up the gangplank
secure in the knowledge that he and his family can depend on the protection of a great organization. 
An organization the seafarers themselves, with their own intelligence and effort, have brought into being.
You've seen the story of how the seafarers, conscious of their rights, and their responsibilities, are working together for their common objectives: dignity, security, a better way of life for themselves and for their families.
   This is the story of the S.I.U..
Last day of my life.
Diary, 24th of September, 1916.
Near Combres.
I had spent the night in an old ruined cellar with its walls dripping green moisture.
And so now it was good to feel the warmth of the sun striking through the folds of my damp tunic.
And the morning was perfect.
There was nothing to be heard, save the occasional murmur of soldiers' voices and the crunch of boots on the loose soil.
And in the gentle lulling warmth, the war seemed very remote, for here was peace.
One time, I remember I slowly became aware of the sound of men digging on the other side of the bank near where I stood.
I don't know what they were digging for exactly, but I do remember that they sounded very cheerful about it.
Especially when somebody nearby started a phonograph going.
It was very comforting to hear those cheerful noises because, well, it was such a warm and peaceful morning, and it all helped me to forget about the war.
And perhaps, not only me for all around me in this desolate back area there were soldiers relaxing.
Soldiers quiet and easy in the sun, a whole army at rest, like an unwound clock spring, men released from a hell in a merciful peace that is suddenly shattered.
Shattered by the soft, but deadly voices of guns, an insistent clamouring from a heavy barrage at the front two miles away.
Start to feel the certain pangs of fear and the gentle breath of the morning turns sour.
But does any of this affect the other members of my section?
Seems not.
Pretzlav at the end is now concluding some coarse joke.
Other men appear to be quite unconcerned and relaxed.
I can't tell whether those men at the end are as scared as I am.
I don't know.
They maybe able to cover up well, for a couple of French soldiers from the front are passing them and the only reaction seems to be that
Pretzlav has some rude remark for them.
But to me, the sight of those dusty soldiers clumping away brings the physical feel of war close the first time.
And then suddenly I hear the rattle of rifle bolts and the clink of steel helmets and then the crunch of marching feet, as men all around me march off to the front...
Crunch! Crunch! Crunch!
Each seismic crunch of the boot draws the war closer and closer.
Oh God, soon it will be my turn and my feet, too.
Crunch! Crunch!
Dragging me forward towards those guns.
Those bloody blasted guns!
I suppose I must be making a melodrama out of all this.
There's something so unnatural, so horrible about the sight of those soldiers, plodding like soulless automatons through a desolate land.
It's all rather unnerved me.
Anyway, I must try to pull myself together like those other men over there who seem to be quietly relaxing in the sun.
Yes, Pretzlav there, who seems to spend almost every waking minute relishing one of the highly immoral and vulgar leaves he spent and of course solid, dour Bill Richards, who seems to spend most of his time listening to Pretzlav.
Then of course, there's dear old Tom Mason who has been in the war since early 1915.
He can be a little old fashioned at times.
Particularly where a young
Ginger Morris is concerned, who has without doubt the most active bowel system in the British Army.
He's always emerging from behind some bush or other.
And as he usually has some cheeky answer ready.
Poor old Tom ends up by being furious.
But Ted Crompton,
I've never really liked.
Probably because I feel he rather enjoys his war.
As for young Lieutenant Ferris,
I always think how awful it must be for him, for an offensive...
He's always got to appear calm and in complete control of his nerves, no matter what he really feels.
It's probably a lot easier for the experienced Sergeant Harman.
He's been in the front a good many times before.
Oh God, those guns again, they seem to be nearer now.
Louder and more insistent.
They seem to destroy every vestige of the peace and beauty of this morning.
Air is foul, the trees seem to become twisted and warped.
Branches jab at me, sharp, pointed and hard like steel, like a battle.
Oh God, a battle. I'm scared.
I'm so bloody scared.
I know what's going to happen.
I can see it all in my mind.
I can see it.
I can see the details of a battle in my mind.
I can... I can hear the noise.
I can see the blurred confusion.
Men running, men left to die.
I... Oh God! It's too awful.
Too bloody... Oh, I'm so scared.
Well, this...
This is what I'm going to go through.
Watch them cheering.
They've gained an area of about 200 square yards of mud, just heaving, stinking mud.
And in a short while, the game old
Bosch will win it back again.
In the meanwhile, let them cheer, it's a wonderful achievement.
And that...
That is howl shall probably die.
Left like some torn, screwed up rag on the battlefield.
When you know this is going to happen to you, your body suddenly becomes something terribly precious to you.
Your flesh, soft and warm, is yours.
Your personal belonging, not to be treated like some discarded piece of offal.
You find yourself thinking about this, realizing what a wonderful thing your body is and what an awful and wrong thing it is to maltreat it.
But all that is to come.
At the moment it's just the watching and the waiting.
Watching the lieutenant and waiting for someone, probably a brigade runner to bring him our movement orders.
Orders that will take us to the front, to those guns.
Oh, come on!
Why the hell doesn't something happen?
Time is just grinding by and nothing is happening.
Or perhaps...
Perhaps the runner won't appear.
Perhaps... Hmm.
Oh God!
I should have known.
Should have known that there'd be no escape.
The others must know it, too.
I wonder what they're thinking about.
What's going on behind that cold front of Crompton's.
Crompton, who has vowed to run at least three Germans through with his bayonet before the battle is over.
Is he really as hard and as cold as he would have us believe'?
Or is all this toughness merely a front to cover his real feelings?
Only he knows.
Now, don't envy poor old Tom, he's been to the front so many times before, he really knows what he's in for.
Must be awful for him.
Must be awful for all of them.
Just managing to control their feelings on the outside, they wait and watch in silence, impassive, expressionless.
But what's on the inside?
Fear'?
Resentment?
Bewilderment?
Or just loneliness?
If that officer had only the power to write down what each of his men really felt.
And could then make the people who start these wars read about it.
Then, maybe they'd... Maybe...
Oh, well.
Anyway I see now that we're about to start our little war.
So, let's pull up our equipment, pull it on and get ready to play at being tin soldiers and go and fight for a few yards of earth.
So, now I'm ready with my rifle and bayonet and steel helmet and ammunition.
I suppose I must be everything that those recruiting posters say I should be.
They don't tell you you can get so scared, so numb that even the rough canvas webbing, you can't feel it.
You just don't know it's there.
The whole body is a vacuum without feeling.
Except for the hands, their cold, clammy palm.
To be a proper soldier you've got to wipe your hand by making little furtive moves so that nobody can see.
There's...
There's an ache in your throat.
And your head hurts and your...
And your mind flicks from thing to thing.
You can't think properly.
Your hands remotely do odd little things without you knowing.
Oh God, my head hurts.
Why can't someone explain to me just why I've got to die'?
Soon... Soon there'll be nothing.
Just a void. Nothing.
And Tom...
Tom, please help me.
Give me some of your strength, so that I won't be scared, as you're not scared.
Tom, please help me.
And he didn't say a thing.
Didn't try to help me.
I just don't know why, or was he scared too'?
I shall never know. I shall never know.
So then it was time for us to leave.
Well, I suppose in years to come people will say about us...
"They went with songs to the battle."
"They were young, straight of limb, true of eye, steady and aglow."
God, if only they knew.
As we marched along the top of the ridge,
I saw below us a German prisoner.
He was the first German soldier
I'd ever seen.
As I looked at him, I saw the complete ridiculousness of the whole thing.
He was eating a bowl of soup or something and he looked so ordinary, so harmless.
He might have been
Pretzlav or Morris sitting there, just wearing a different uniform.
This man was meant to be our enemy, one of the soldiers of the hated imperial German empire.
One of the men we've been trained to kill.
And he looked so harmless.
But the most terrible thing about war is not just the fact that we have to kill men so much like ourselves, but that we have to hate them and keep on hating them.
And now, meanwhile, all that is left to us, to our section is to go forward and fight and kill men like him, like ourselves.
Seems so bloody pointless, we go forward to those guns and God only knows what'll happen to us.
God only knows.
We're told what a tremendous thing it is to die for one's country.
Well, tell it to those two.
