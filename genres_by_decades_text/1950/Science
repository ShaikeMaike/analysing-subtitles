Ladies and gentlemen, the hundred yards race has been won by the sports mistress of our local high school,
Miss Caroline Trewella.
- I lost my bathing cap.
- you won the race, though.
- That was just luck.
- Proud of you, Caroline!. Proud of you!
- Congratulations, Miss Trewella.
- Thank you.
Now you've won the cup for the third time, you've won it outright.
I know that I'm speaking for everybody here when I say...
- Caroline's lucky week.
- yes.
Jolly good show, her aunt leaving her that house in Cornwall.
Pity it's in such an outlandish place, though.
She's frightfully thrilled about it.
- If they don't hurry up, she'll miss her train.
- Uh-oh.
TANNOY.. The next train from platform 3 is for Penzance, calling at Westbury, Taunton,
Exeter, Newton Abbot, Plymouth,
Liskeard, Bodmin Road, and all stations to Penzance.
What a rush!
(Flatly) I hope you have a nice weekend at Smuggler's Rest. you sound as though you do.
It's a ridiculous waste of money to be travelling first class.
It's a long journey and I wanted to relax.
Oh, well.
Have you got sandwiches and things?.
- I'm going to have a meal on the train.
- Isn't that rather extravagant?.
Caroline, the more we save now, the sooner we can get married.
That is what you want, isn't it?. yes, Ronald.
Good. Here is the newspaper for you.
- Thank you.
- It's all right. I've finished with it.
I should hope so. It's yesterday's.
Goodbye.
Bye.
GUARD.. Pencarrow!. Pencarrow!.
I can manage.
Pencarrow. Pencarrow.
Passengers for Pencarrow get out here.
Thank you.
Tickets, please. All tickets, please.
- Is there a porter?.
- No, miss. No porter tonight.
- Could I have a taxi, then?.
- No taxi neither.
How do I get to a house called Smuggler's Rest?.
Smuggler's Rest is up along, about three quarters of a mile.
- Oh, dear.
- I'll carry it for you, miss.
Thank you.
I'll make it worth your while.
That's very kind of you.
Hello.
That's Smuggler's Rest up there.
Now, here we are.
Oh, yes, thank you.
Thank you very much.
Well, isn't it enough?.
Quite enough, miss.
- Miss Trewella.
- Ah, Mrs Forster. you're very welcome, miss, I'm sure. you've got a look of the Trewellas, bless you.
- Good evening, Mr Jeffrey, sir.
- Good evening, Mrs Forster.
I've just been doing my good turn for the day.
Very kind of you indeed, sir.
If ever you feel like a little fishing,
Miss Trewella, I shall be delighted.
Any time.
Thank you.
Thank you, Mrs Forster.
- Well, now, this is most attractive.
- Oh, I am glad.
Mrs Forster, who exactly is Mr Jeff...?.
Mr Jeffrey Saunders, miss.
One of the richest gentlemen hereabouts.
- I thought he was a fisherman.
- He does fish. It's his hobby, like.
I see. you know, I haven't been here since I was a child. you won't find things change much round about here.
It's funny. That picture's the only thing that I can remember.
She's the lady that enticed your great-grandfather down to the sea.
Was he drowned?.
Not exactly, but they do say he was sunk the moment he set eyes on her.
Ah. There's a lot of nonsense talked about mermaids in Cornwall.
Hello, boys. Thirsty?.
- Good evening, sir.
- Evening, Mr Jeffrey.
- Two more pints, Charlie.
- Right, sir.
- How are things?.
- Bad, Mr Jeffrey, bad.
Last night's catch was the worst this year.
I reckon there's a shark of some sort round abouts.
- Why?.
- No fish.
And the gulls won't rest on the water.
They always know, all right.
Besides, Old Rundle saw something funny out in the bay.
Oh, I saw it all right. I saw it all right, Mr Jeffrey.
A great big shiny tail.
Like nothing I'd never seen before.
- Was it after closing time?.
- (Laughs)
Now, have I seen everything?.
- yes.
- What's here?.
That goes down to the old smuggler's cave, but the steps are all fallen away.
- Have you been down?.
- No! I don't want to break my neck.
It ought to have been bricked up years ago.
- Is that the sea?.
- yes.
It makes strange noises sometimes.
At night, most particular.
- What do you mean?.
- Well, sort of eerie sounds.
Almost inhuman.
M- m-m-m-m-m-ruh!
M- m-m-m-m-ruh!
Gracious!
If you're nervous, you're welcome to sleep at my cottage.
It would take more than echoes to make me nervous.
I'm sick of playing this dreary trumpet.
It's no good being nervous. It's nothing.
It is! I've heard it twice.
Is anybody there?.
Hello.
But you're me! you can't be.
I'm Miranda. Who are you supposed to be?.
I don't know.
Oooh!
Berengaria, be quiet. Submerge. you're a Trewella, by the look of you.
I'm one, too.
The wrong side of the blanket, of course.
I was born on the ocean bed.
The ocean bed?.
But... then you're a mermaid!
Naturally.
Look.
- See what I mean?.
- But you can't be. There aren't any.
Is she a Trewella?.
Oh, no. Between you and me, she's a bit simple.
Her mother was frightened by an octopus.
Poor thing.
As a matter of fact, she's a silly creature, but she's always been my accompanist.
I think I'll come ashore.
We must have a mutual great-grandfather.
That's right.
Old Matthew Trewella was terribly gay.
He used to take my great-grandma on dry land sometimes.
As a matter of fact, I've been on dry land also.
How did you manage?.
I had a whale of a time!
I met the most lovely men. Do you know any?.
I'm engaged to one.
Has he got pretty legs?.
I don't think I'd call them "pretty".
Well, then, you must get another one.
Do you like being a mermaid?.
It's dull at the moment. All the men are away.
- The mermen, of course.
- yes. They've gone to a coral convention.
They go every year for two weeks.
Would you like to come into the house and have a talk and a drink, if your husbands or friends are away?.
Wouldn't you think it strange to have a mermaid in the sitting room?.
Not any more. It seems quite natural.
Rather fun to have a fish in the family.
I think you're a darling.
It must be lovely to be you.
Caroline, would you let me be you, just for two weeks?. I'm so lonely.
But how could you?. What about your...
I'd wrap it up and go as an invalid.
Well, I did half-promise a friend to go on a cycling tour.
I suppose you could take my place for two weeks.
But who would look after you?.
There's a nurse in London who looked after me last time.
She understands my little ways.
Nurse Carey.
- Come in.
There's a young lady to see you, Nurse.
- Put it on the table, please.
- I said a young lady, Nurse.
- What?.
- A young lady to see you.
Oh?. What's her name?.
- Miss Trewella.
- Miss Trewella! Miranda!
But you're walking. you've grown legs!
How do you do?. I'm afraid I'm not Miranda.
Not Miranda?. But your face, your voice...
We have the same family tree, it's just that Miranda is the underwater branch.
Incredible.
I've just come from her.
She needs your help.
- Needs my help!
- She wants to come on land again.
The darling creature!
She shall! She shall! She shall!
Hello, Mrs Forster.
I hear Miss Trewella's coming back.
Morning, Mr Jeff. Morning, George.
That's right. Tomorrow afternoon.
I thought I'd better give her one of these as a peace offering.
Ooh! What a beauty! This'll cheer her up.
- Here's one for you, Mrs Forster.
- Thank you very much, Mr Jeff.
Poor girl's had an accident. Did you know?. yes. She fell out of them parallel bars, whatever they may be.
- Is she badly hurt?.
- It's her legs.
She won't be able to walk for some time.
Well, if there's anything I can do...
She'll need someone to carry her round. yes. Thank you, Mr Jeff, but she's bringing a trained nurse with her.
Good morning.
- Hello, Mrs Forster.
- Oh, Miss Trewella! My poor dear!
Where are my boys?.
Where's the porter?. Ooh, there you are.
That's right.
- Just put the bags down there, will you?.
- No trouble, madam.
Thank you very much.
- One moment, my man.
- It's a pleasure.
- There we are. Thank you very much.
- Thank you, madam.
Oh! Take care! Take care!
Those are my dear, darling boys.
Are you sure you're going to be all right?.
Well, I shan't be quite myself for the next two weeks.
- (Tuts)
- Nurse Carey.
Coming, Miss Trewella. Coming!
- This is Mrs Forster.
- How do you do?.
Oh, dear. A pussy.
Where will our sanctuary be?.
- Well, your room's in there, Nurse.
- Thank you very much.
Naughty pussy! you mustn't!
I'll be going.
The meal's all ready. See you in the morning.
Thank you.
Does it shine?. I want it to look wonderful.
If I went on shore, I should have a perm.
But then I never shall. you're really much more fish than I am.
I know.
I've only to sit on a rock for ten minutes and I get landsick.
I only get lovesick.
I think men are so beautiful.
Huh! Men!
The only one I ever trusted tried to harpoon me.
Fabulous!
Oh, what a miraculous cavern.
Miranda! Miranda! We're here!
- How blue the sea is.
- We've come to fetch you.
- So, this is her home.
- Be careful, now.
I'm very sure of foot. Oh!
Thank you.
I'll get her rug.
Miss Miranda!
Miss Miranda! Here I am!
Nurse! I knew you'd come.
Of course I came.
Oh! you pretty thing!
- But where's the other young lady?.
- young lady?.
She's down there shrimping.
Berengaria!
Nurse Carey - Berengaria.
Oh! How do you do?.
How do I do what?.
Well, just how do you do?.
I like your bonnet.
Do you?.
Couldn't you make one out of seaweed?.
Would you wear a cabbage on your head?.
No, perhaps not.
Very interesting, of course, but not quite a lady.
Here comes Miss Caroline.
Ready?.
We'll wrap you up and get you up to the house.
Goodbye, Miranda. Keep your tail wet.
Bye-bye, Bere! oodbye!.
I'd better take a change of shoes.
Even if it pours, Viola cycles through.
Camping with the girls.
What a waste of a tent!
Miranda, you must behave. you're supposed to be me and you're engaged.
Come along, dear, come along. you've a long cycle ride ahead of you.
Miranda, please be good.
I'll be better than good.
I'll be the best they've seen here for years.
Nurse, you must look after her.
See that she doesn't get into any hot water.
(Laughs) She could hardly do that, eh?.
Don't you worry, you just look after yourself.
I should be clear of the village by daylight.
If only all our British girls were as brave as you.
See you in two weeks' time.
On! On, Britannia!
Well, she's gone.
The poor, buttoned-up creature.
Isn't it funny to think that
Great-Grandma was in this very house?. yes, yes, yes.
The dear, pretty soul.
What a pity Miss Caroline's having to sell the house.
Sell the house?.
Why?.
Financial reasons, dear.
Besides, very soon she's going to get married.
But why can't they come and live here?.
Her fiance is some sort of engineer, and he's got to work in London.
What's he like?.
Well, look.
- hardly bursting with sex appeal, is he?.
- None at all.
Still, I dare say he's very dependable.
Dependable, my tail!
I'll hook a better one than that for Caroline.
- Nurse!
- yes.
- Open up the wardrobe.
- yes, yes.
Oh, my!
How awful!
No wonder she only caught Ronald, with that for bait.
Let's see what else there is.
Ah, here we are.
Here's something a little less refined, rather more chic.
It's too hot and it wouldn't show enough of me.
- Now, Miss Miranda...
- We must buy some new ones. yes, yes, but what about the money?.
I've got plenty in the cave below.
Berengaria will give it to you tomorrow morning.
Oh, good, good, good.
Arise and shine!
Hello, old trout.
Old trout yourself!
I want Miss Miranda's breakfast.
Well, here it is!
Steady on! I'm not a seal!
She wants me to fish up her ditty box.
Catch.
Pandora's box.
Ooh, look at this.
That belonged to my great-granny.
Oh, poor soul.
- I fancy that.
- A little too big for you.
Perhaps it is.
This looks more like you.
Oh, how lovely!
For a grand occasion.
The cat's whiskers.
- Can I keep it?.
- Certainly..
Thank you.
Good gracious!
What are all these coins?.
- Doubloons.
- Spanish doubloons?.
But you'll never be able to spend them.
Can't we exchange them somewhere?.
I don't think there's a pawnbroker's in this village.
I don't want to get my clothes in this village.
We've got to go to Torquay.
Good, good, good.
Here we are.
I've never been inside one of these places before.
I'd like to go in alone, please.
Would you, dear?.
I do hope they won't cheat you.
Don't worry, I'm used to dealing with sharks. yes, very well.
Good morning.
Good morning.
What lovely curls!
Are they permanent?.
They've been with me ever since I can remember.
They must be such fun to comb. yes.
Er, what can I do for you?.
- Think of something nice.
- Is there something you fancy in the window?.
Not in the window.
I want to sell these.
Oh, yes, of course.
Old gold.
- Spanish?.
- They've been in my family for years.
Well, they're worth quite a lot of money.
Would you like ready cash or would you care for me to arrange a credit with your bank?.
They'd be most surprised if you did.
Oh, really. Which is your bank?.
- The Dogger.
- The Dogger Bank?. yes.
We must get on, dear.
We've such heaps to do.
He's bought them. Isn't he sweet?.
- Charming.
- Oh, it was a great pleasure.
- Bye.
- Goodbye.
I didn't think he'd take them.
He can't have seen anything like those before.
He can't have seen anything like me before.
Well, no, of course not.
Now, clothes!
Christopher Columbus!
She's off!
What delicious abandon.
- Thank you.
- It's been a pleasure.
- Are you having trouble?.
- yes, we are.
- Let me help you.
- Thank you very much. you're very strong.
It's a pleasure.
I knew the late Miss Trewella.
Oh, I'm always early. you never know what you'll miss if you're late.
My name is Sutton. Barclay Sutton.
- I shall call you Barclay.
- yes, please do.
May I introduce my fiancee,
Barbara Davenport?. We're distant cousins.
The distance is merely relative.
I was afraid you were his wife. you teach at St Hilda's, don't you?.
Kensington?.
- That's right.
- My uncle, Sir Felix, is one of the governors.
- you know him?.
- I'm his favourite mistress.
- We're going to be close neighbours.
- The closer the better.
The Hall is half a mile from your house.
- yes, you must come over and see us.
- Sometime.
- Is tomorrow soon enough?.
- By all means.
- Why don't you come to dinner?.
- I'd love to. How do I get there?.
I'll come and fetch you in my car.
- Oh, I love motoring.
- you can hardly call half a mile motoring.
- It all depends how fast you go.
- If you please.
Until tomorrow, then.
- Goodbye.
- Bye.
She's oddly ingenuous, isn't she?.
I should say she was just odd.
We must be nice to her.
She's having a rough time.
From what I can see, I should think she would like it to be even rougher.
I'm sorry to keep you waiting, but the most extraordinary thing has happened.
Someone's put six Spanish doubloons in the collection.
- They're pretty rare, aren't they?.
- Museum pieces, Colonel.
- Have you any idea who it could be?.
- I can only think it must be Miss Trewella.
- That's where we settle.
- Don't you love the Colonel's moustache?.
- yes. Very handsome.
- He reminds me of a walrus I once knew.
My late husband had a moustache, a ginger one.
I used to trim it with my surgical scissors.
- Did you like it?.
- It was rather ticklesome.
Sometimes it retained the froth from his ale.
- How lovely!
- Oh, no, it wasn't.
I hope Caroline likes them because the Colonel would make rather a good match.
He evidently thinks you most fascinating.
Shall we add him to our list of possibles?.
A very good beginning.
But he's not the only pebble on the beach.
Can you see that beautiful man there?.
- I should say so.
- I could fall for him hook, line and sinker.
- Hello!
- Miranda, please.
- Good morning, Miss Trewella.
- He knows my name.
- Isn't he beautiful?.
- yes, yes.
- I'm sorry about your accident.
- yes, it is trying.
If I could walk, I could come down there and see what you're doing.
I can soon remedy that.
Ooh! How intrepid.
Be careful! She's rather delicate.
Oh, don't take her down there.
Mind how you go! you might lose your foothold!
Don't slip on the mackerel.
Hello, old gentleman.
Hello, missy.
Would you be a darling and go and keep my nurse company?.
Aye, I would.
It's a long time since I kept company, but once you know how, you never lose the knack.
- How's that?.
- Perfect.
The young lady sent me up to keep you company, nursey.
- Oh, she did, did she?.
- But I came willing, all right.
- Do you mind if I sit down?.
- you seem to have sat down, don't you?.
I love your legs.
What's your name?.
But you know. Jeff Saunders.
I like you, Jeff.
- Does my pipe worry you?.
- Well, no. I like the smell of good tobacco.
Oh! (Coughs)
Perhaps you'd hold that skein for me, would you?.
- yes, ma'am.
- Thank you.
There we are.
By the way, who's that young fisherman down there?.
He's no fisherman. He's a gentleman.
What?.
And very rich, they say.
Oh, well, that's splendid. Is he married?.
No. I reckon he's too wise.
I don't know what you mean by that.
He'd rather make several ladies happy than one miserable.
Oh, yes, I see.
I suppose that's rather level-headed.
(Chuckles) I'm glad you like my tobacco.
I don't like it all that much.
It's not a brand I'd choose to smoke myself. you feel wonderful. you're different, somehow.
Different?.
From the last time we met.
Oh, yes.
Do we know one another very well?.
Hardly very well.
Don't you think it's about time we got to know one another better?. yes.
Another little titbit, Rupert, my love?.
Morning, miss.
Morning.
Thank you.
There. How are your legs this morning?.
I can't feel them at all.
Morning, Nurse. Lovely morning. yes, indeed.
- My boys are glad to be alive.
- your breakfast is in the dining room.
Thank you, Mrs Forster.
I'll be out in a minute or two.
Sausages and coffee.
Salt water and shrimps.
Lovely!
Thank you, Nurse.
Two lunches.
Two dinners. Two brekkers.
Very bad for my figure. yes?. yes?. All right, I'll hold on.
Operator, this is ridiculous.
I've been waiting 17 minutes for a call to Cornwall...
Good.
Oh, all right. Keep your wool on. yes?.
Hello. Is that Smuggler's Rest?.
Mr Baker here.
Must be Miss Caroline's fiance from London.
That'll be Ronald. I'll take it.
Hello, Ronnie.
"Ronnie"?. Now, Caroline, you know how I detest abbreviations.
Now, time is money, you know.
How are your legs?.
Fine.
What?. Well, I still think a nurse was quite unnecessary.
Oh, I see.
I really rang up to give you some good news.
I am coming down to Cornwall for a day or two.
Oh, you are! When are you arriving?.
9.49 this evening.
This evening?.
I just can't wait.
This evening you're dining at the Hall, with the Moustache.
That's why I can't wait.
If you're not back before Ronald arrives, what shall I say?.
- Tell him I'm dining out.
- yes, yes, of course.
Ooh! Look here!
If they should ask you about your accident, don't forget to tell them you fell between parallel bars.
That's right - bars.
I can't think what you are going to do about the food.
- Get rid of it.
- But where, dear, where?.
- In my sponge bag.
- Oh! yes, of course.
- That'll be the Moustache.
- yes, yes, yes.
- Good evening, Colonel.
- Good evening.
She's all ready for you.
Hello.
Well! Well, well, well, well, well. you look very cool and calm.
And waiting to be collected.
Up you come. you smell delicious.
- Bye, Nurse.
- Bye, love. Take this with you.
- Thank you.
- Look after her, Colonel.
The dear naughty thing!
It was sweet of you to fetch me yourself.
We can't have every Tom, Dick and Harry manhandling you, can we?.
Well, not all at the same time.
- I say, Miss Trewella.
- Call me M...
Caroline.
Caroline.
When you say Caroline, your moustache gives a lovely twitch.
Twitch it again.
Caroline.
Nurse Carey says it'll tickle. Will it?.
Goodbye! Have a fine frolic!
Miss Berengaria!
Miss Berengaria!
Are you anywhere about?.
(yawns) Hello, nursey.
Oh, there you are.
I was having a snooze.
What?. Under the water?.
- My gills still work.
- Of course, of course.
I brought my sewing down.
I thought you might be lonely.
- What are you making?.
- I'm embroidering a boudoir cap and a nightie.
- Whoever for?.
- For myself.
- Oh, show me.
- All right. I'll try them on.
I must do it properly.
It took me simply months to embroider this.
I must have the bows.
Is it funny?.
Now, how's that?.
I want it.
Naughty!
No, no. Mustn't touch.
If I had legs, I'd wear pyjamas.
Oh, yes.
Well, I do... on alternate weeks.
May I have some more?.
I'm terribly thirsty.
Delicious.
Do you find that champagne rather dry?.
No, it's lovely and wet, thank you.
Barclay was saying you don't look in the least like a schoolmistress.
Oh?. Why?.
Rather too charming.
Thank you.
What er... subjects do you take?.
- Games.
- Fun and games?.
There's plenty of fun out of school.
It's certainly fun having you so near us.
Barclay simply pines for female company.
He's so easily attracted.
I suppose he must be.
But his enthusiasm... never lasts for long.
How trying for you.
But never mind.
We always say where I come from,
"There are as many good men on dry land as ever fell in the sea. "
Mm. I dare say there's a great deal of truth in that.
- I suppose you swim well.
- Like a fish. Why?.
Barbara's very good in the sea.
I'm not particularly good in the sea.
How very extraordinary.
- Most extraordinary.
- Oh! Will you have some more chicken?.
No, thank you.
I haven't quite got my appetite back yet.
Most unfortunate about your accident.
It has its compensations.
How did it happeng?.
I was going from one bar to another, and I fell down.
I see you're engaged. yes, but I don't mind breaking it off.
Oh, really?. Why?.
I find my fiance rather repulsive.
Brandy, madam?.
Oh, thank you. I'll help myself.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Delicious.
That Miss Trewella.
- What?.
- Drinks like a fish.
Really?.
Half a pint of Napoleon brandy gone in one gulp.
She must have a strong head.
- It's as well she has a full stomach.
- But she hasn't. Look!
# I can't resist...
# Men
# Can't do without them
# Weak ones or strong, right men or wrong
# I don't mind
# Here in my arms, they all have charms
# I'm so fond of men
# Can't resist men
# I love them all, then...
# Easy to date, that's been my fate
# From the age of...
# Ten
# I can't resist...
# Men
Enchanting.
That was quite charming. yes, wasn't it?.
- Where were you trained?.
- The Canary Islands.
I studied singing once.
But I got so lazy about my scales.
Oh, really?. I've never had any trouble with my scales.
Why don't you ask her to sing at your concert next week?.
What concert?.
A charity affair I'm organising over at the theatre in Pennregis.
In the theatre! Oh, I'd love to.
I'm afraid we've got rather a full programme.
Some other time, perhaps.
- Shall I sing to you?.
- No, thank you.
Has Miranda said anything against my voice?.
No, no, no. She said you played a conch shell very nicely.
- I sing much better.
- Do you?.
My high notes are so high that only a dogfish can hear them.
Wouldn't it be a pity to waste them on me?.
Of course, Miranda has never really forgiven me for scaring away a very handsome lifeguard.
Oh?. How did you do that?.
By singing.
It was last year.
There I was sitting on the Needles.
Perhaps that was the trouble, dear.
Ten to one that's Miss Caroline's fiance.
And no-one to answer the door.
Now, be as quiet as a clam.
I'll be right down back here as soon as I've settled him.
Bye-bye.
What a hullabaloo!
Patience! Patience!
Oh. Mr Baker?. yes.
Do come in.
I'm afraid Miss Trewella is out.
But she's expecting me.
Will she be long?.
Well, I really don't know.
She's dining at the Hall.
She can walk again, I see.
No, no, no.
The young gentleman carried her.
I don't care for that at all.
She seemed to enjoy it.
Goodbye, Barbara.
Thank you for a lovely evening.
- your playing was perfect.
- Oh, thank you.
I do so like a musical background.
Excuse me, madam,
I think you left this in the dining room.
Ah! My toothbrush.
I never go anywhere without it.
It's a habit that I picked up from my great-grandfather, Old Matthew Trewella.
He always used to say,
"Where I dines, I sleeps. "
He was a very determined man.
Goodbye, Barbara.
Goodbye.
- Simes?.
- yes, madam?.
- Was that a sponge bag?.
- yes, madam.
- What was in it?.
- Miss Trewella's dinner, madam.
- Her dinner?.!
- yes, madam.
Very tiresome customer.
I'll settle him, all right.
Miss Berengaria! Miss Berengaria!
Oooh!
- Take it off at once!
- Try and get it, you old trout!
My nightie! My nightie! My... you naughty girl!
It's naughty of you, doing that!
I'll catch you!
I'll catch you!
I'll catch you!
# I can't resist men
# Bo-bo-bo-bo
# Can't do without them
# Bo-bo bobo-bo
Barclay, it's been wonderful.
Has it, Carolineg?.
Now, where will you kiss me?.
It doesn't tickle at all.
Caroline, your breath is like ozone.
What's ozone?.
A condensed form of oxygen emitting a pungent odour.
Ah, Barclay!
This is my fiance, Ronald.
- How do you do?.
- Not at all well, thank you.
I didn't know you were in Cornwall.
So it seems.
- Well, I expect you'd like to take over.
- yes.
- Right?.
- Right.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Sweet dreams.
And what do you mean by allowing that man to kiss you?.
He's a very beautiful man, and I liked it.
I don't think there's nearly enough kissing goes on.
Don't you want to kiss me?.
Well, I... I can't kiss you just like that.
Have you got another way?.
What's come over you?. you've never been like this before.
We did waste time, didn't we?. you know, you could be quite attractive.
Let's take your glasses off.
Perhaps not.
But you always seemed so sensible and level-headed, and...
Dull.
I don't want a wife who sparkles.
Just look at that dress.
It's lovely, isn't it?.
It's far too revealing.
I'd be ashamed to wear it.
I doubt if it would suit you.
And all those pearls.
If you go on spending at this rate, you'll be on the rocks in a fortnight.
I know.
Well, she's either a roaring drunk or a raving lunatic.
- She's just full of spirits.
- Overflowing.
She tossed a neat half-pint of brandy into the flowerpot.
I meant high spirits, Barbara.
I've done the same sort of thing myself.
- At the regimental dinner last...
- yes, dear. We know.
Did you put the regimental dinner into a sponge bag?.
- Dinner?.
- Or put doubloons into the church collection?.
Well, I... I can't help feeling sorry for her.
Oh! you haven't met her fiance. I have.
He wears glasses.
He comes from Beckenham.
I'm glad he's turned up.
It'll keep you out of trouble.
Everyone knows she hasn't a penny.
Old Miss Trewella left practically nothing except the house.
- you don't think she's after my money, do you?.
- I don't see what else.
Well, I'm bound to tell you, Barbara, there might be something else.
Oh?. What?.
My moustache.
Now, business.
I came down here to sell the house.
Not to see me.
Might as well be frank about it.
No time for slop.
Quite a nice little place, but give me a modern maisonette any day.
It's been in my family for generations.
The sooner it isn't, the better.
What have you done about selling it?.
Nothing.
Tomorrow morning you and I go to the house agent's together.
Tomorrow morning I am going fishing.
It must be wonderful being a fisherman's wife. you can have too much of a good thing.
I don't believe it.
This is a new line I've got.
Is it?. It's most effective.
Where do you live, Jeff?.
Over at Pennregis.
That's where Barbara Davenport's giving her concert. yes. What we suffer for charity.
I'd love to be in it.
I've got a bite!
It must be enormous!
Doesn't your fiance mind you being out with me?.
He's furious.
- Aren't you in love with him?.
- No, I'm not.
- Then what about...
- He was forced onto me.
Oh, you poor darling.
Jeff, you're so understanding.
Oh! (Giggles)
Only an old gull.
- Excuse me.
- Good morning, sir. Lovely morning.
Where could I find a fisherman named Jeff Saunders?.
Oh, he went out some time ago.
- That's his boat over there, look.
- Oh, yes.
I wonder if I might look through your telescope.
I don't suppose
Mr Saunders would mind.
Oh!
There. It's a very unusual recipe.
I hope it's to your liking.
That's lovely. Thank you.
- What on earth is it?.
- Mussel soup.
Oh. A very little for me.
Good.
But it's cold!
That's the way I like it.
And raw fish. I saw you this morning in the boat, with that man.
We didn't fish for long.
He wanted to kiss me.
- And you let him.
- I had to encourage him slightly.
Whilst you were out,
I put the house in the hands of the agents.
The sooner I get you back to Beckenham, the better.
Nothing would induce me to leave the coast.
And what about my career?. In a hole like this?. your career as what?.
Sanitary Officer, of course.
Sanitary Officer.
So you're one of those people that think it's a good idea to dump all sorts of horrid things into the sea.
What better place is there for refuse?.
I've always wanted to meet one of you. yes. For once, I'm ashamed of you.
It may have been ill-mannered, but it got rid of him.
- But the poor damp boy...
- He'll be dry by the time he gets to London.
- That's all very well, but...
- He should have brought another suit.
We haven't all got two of everything.
Think of my one lovely nightie, floating out there all alone in the bay.
Hello.
Barclay?.
It's me.
Ronald's gone back to London.
I've broken off my engagement.
What?.
Capital. That's really quite something, isn't it.
Very encouraging all round.
Look, er... shall I canter over to see you this afternoon?.
Oh, yes. Then I can ride with you.
I tell you what.
I'll gallop.
Here's the Colonel arriving.
This is where I go and feed my birds.
- Good evening, Colonel.
- Good evening.
- Hello.
- Hello.
I'm awfully sorry.
I'm afraid I got rather carried away last night.
Don't apologise. It was your turn to be carried.
- Has your fiance gone for good?.
- Yes.
And are you staying for good?.
I'm staying, Barclay.
I've er... I've bought you a present.
How sweet of you! What is it?.
Something rather personal.
They say a girl can't have too many.
That's right, Barclay. A girl can't.
I just thought that's what Caroline would like. yes, Barclay. Caroline would.
Ooooh!
Good afternoon, ma'am. you've swum a good way out, ma'am.
- you're not in trouble, I suppose.
- Oh, in trouble! you naughty old man!
I didn't mean anything disrespectful, lady.
I'm no lady.
The currents are very strong around here.
Mind you're not carried out to sea.
Would you like me to sing to you?.
Sing to me?. No, thank you, ma'am.
I've got a voice like a siren.
I reckon you might have, at that.
No, ma'am.
That'd upset the mackerel, that would.
After all, there's a time and place for all things.
What's that you're doing?.
If that's the way you're feeling, you'd better come aboard.
Argh!
I've always wanted to ride a horse.
Can't we go any faster?.
Faster?. you're an invalid, remember.
Hold on!
Barclay.
Darling Barclay.
I shall hate to leave Cornwall.
Must you?.
My lovely house is up for sale already.
Oh, Caroline.
Never mind.
I've got such sweet memories.
Caroline, stay.
How can I?.
As my wife.
Could I keep my house?.
Why, yes, of course.
Lovely.
May I think it over?.
Don't keep me in suspense.
Ask me again, Saturday week.
I feel in stamping good form. Do you?. yes. Stamping.
Good. Now, with any luck, we should reach Cheddar tomorrow, and Glastonbury the next day.
Good.
- Baker here.
- Hello. Ronald?.
If you have rung to apologise, you're wasting your time.
Apologise for what?.
You know perfectly well.
But I don't know what you mean. your deportment whilst I was down in Cornwall.
Down in Cornwallg?.
Making love to strange men right under my nose.
Throwing a tureen of soup over me.
I smell revolting and my suit is ruined.
Well, I must say, it does sound rather awful.
I don't know what I could have been thinking of.
Are you very scalded?. you know perfectly well the concoction was freezing cold.
Oh, it was! Oh, yes, of course it was.
And... I request the return of my diamond.
Immediately.
Certainly. By registered post.
Finished already?. yes, completely.
Has Miss Berengaria always pinched things, dear?.
- yes, and she's getting worse.
- Really?.
Kleptomania caused by depression,
I should say.
- Have you nearly finished that, darling?.
- Nearly.
That'll be Mr Saunders.
There we are.
Put it away, and curl up your tail.
- Good evening, Nurse.
- Good evening, Mr Saunders.
For me?. How charming of you.
Thank you very much.
Go in, will you?. you'll find her all agog.
- Hello.
- Hello.
I've brought you a present.
- Not a pair of shoes.
- Shoes?.
No, a pair of lobsters.
Oh, thank you.
I've come to say
I shan't be going fishing tomorrow morning.
Why not?.
I'm going out with the regular fishing fleet tonight.
They've been having a lean time.
I hoped I might change their luck.
If you cast your nets near the Durdle Rocks...
.. you will change their luck.
But everyone knows that's a rotten fishing ground.
Promise me you'll fish there tonight.
All right. But where do you get your inside information?.
I'm Cornish.
Perhaps I've got second sight.
I wish I didn't feel that
I'd double-crossed those mackerel.
- Terry Rundle.
- Hello, Miss Barbara.
- Why are the bells ringing?.
- Great news.
There's been a record catch down by Durdle Rocks.
Never saw so many fish in my life.
And all thanks to that Miss Trewella.
She showed us where to cast the nets.
A proper fish diviner she's turned out to be!
Oh, really. That's very interesting.
I reckon the Trewellas always had a way with fish.
Old Matthew Trewella had, anyway. you don't really believe such things, do you?.
I don't know, but...
My old father used to tell me of a very strange catch in the cave under Smuggler's Rest.
Oh.
Did he?.
Oh!
Oooh!
Pink pilchards for pale people.
# Oh, Shenandoah
# I love your brother
# Away, you rolling river
# Oh, Shenandoah,
I love your daughter...
Someone stole her clothes while she was swimming.
I wonder who that could have been.
Jeff, do you know where she was swimming?.
Somewhere down here, I think.
What was the time?.
About an hour ago.
She didn't say anything about me, did she?.
No.
Except that she wanted to ask you to sing at her concert.
Oh.
Will you be there?.
Not unless you promise to sing.
Darling Jeff.
I shall hate to leave Cornwall.
Then don't. Stay.
How can I?.
As my wife.
- Could I keep my house?.
- Why not?. We could live here.
How lovely.
Will you ask me again next Saturday?.
I changed my mind about asking Caroline to sing.
- That's very nice of you, Barbara.
- yes.
I think I'm going to enjoy launching her.
- you must admit, she's got something.
- Oh, yes.
Something no-one else has got.
Oh, Caroline?.
Erm, about my concert, over at Pennregis.
I was wondering if perhaps you'd like to sing, after all.
I'd love to, if you really want me to.
I suppose there's no hope of you being on your feet by then?.
None at all.
I thought not. Well, now... your song.
Suppose we have you perched on the pianog?.
We want everybody to see you.
Lovely.
Will the people from the newspapers be there?.
Oh, yes. The press will be there.
I think I can promise you quite a splash.
I must have the most lovely dress. yes, yes, yes.
Extra-long, since you have to sit on the piano.
And Bere must be there to hear me.
Berengaria, at the Pier Theatre?.
Underneath the pier. you can hear very well.
- Can you?.
- yes, there's a soft, seaweedy slab.
- We go there very often.
- yes, yes, of course.
- What are you going to sing?.
- I don't know. Have you got any ideas?.
I always used to fall back on the Mother's Song from The Merry Matador.
I don't know whether it's quite your style.
It's a song with action.
Do it for me.
Goodness me.
I'll have a try.
- I must have a mandolin.
- A mandolin.
Oh, yes, yes.
# I'm Maria, the matador's mother
# Ole!
# Ole!
# Hey-hey!
# There's nobody keener in all the arena
# To keep him out of the dirt
She really has a fish's tail?.
Oh, yes.
It's quite beautiful, rather like a whiting. you're sure somebody isn't playing a trick on you?.
Of course not. I've seen it myself.
Hm. Tail like a whiting, eh?.
I tell you what, I'll come down myself, tomorrow night.
- Good.
- What time?.
About 730. you'll bring a photographer?.
Of course.
What other personalities will be there?.
First of all, I'm getting onto Dr Fergus.
He's a member of the Zoological Society...
The mating cry of the chimpanzee differs from that of the...
Er, no. No, alter that.
.. the love cry of the larger ape. yes?.
Trunk call for you, Doctor.
Hello.
Barbara Davenport! How are you, my dear?.
A discovery?. How interesting.
A what, did you say?.
A what?.!
Are you sure it's not a seal?.
Catch her!
We must catch her at all costs!
On land?.
Masquerading as a woman?. yes, of course I'll come down. Sure.
Beautiful face?. Never mind the face.
What about her piscatorial extremity?. you've got a namesake down in Pendower.
Oh, really?. yes, another Caroline Trewella.
- What's she been doing?.
- Well, she hasn't done it yet.
What do you mean?.
It says.. "Miss Caroline Trewella, Pendower, will make her debut as a singer at the Pennregis Pier Theatre tonight. "
Miss Barbara Davenport, the organiser, says..
"Miss Trewella is to be my surprise item. "
Surprise item?.
- Good luck tonight, Barbara.
- Thank you.
I think we'd better have this down.
That's fine. Thank you very much.
Oh, Signor Mantalini...
Miss Davenport, who is this Caroline Trewella?.
- She comes from Pendower.
- An amateur?.
- A very exceptional one.
- I am exclusive!
I do not share a cage with a Cornish nightingale.
Cantare una canzone...
A great prima donna! Mantalini has been used as bait - a sprat to catch a mackerel! Hm!
There you are, my love.
Ready for the great moment.
Thank you.
One last little finishing touch.
Which flowers will you wear?.
Roses from the Moustache?.
Or Mr Jeff's orchids?.
Mr Jeff...
I'd be tempted, if they didn't clash. you don't think she'll get away?.
Impossible.
There are policemen all around the pier.
And seal trainers are on guard outside her dressing room.
And used to dealing with slippery customers.
Their mobile tank is ready to transport her to London.
Come in.
Hello.
Hello.
- you look beautiful.
- Doesn't she?.
She's going to be a sensation.
Are Marco and Zampa's performing seals in your show?.
- Performing seals?.
- What do you mean?.
They're in a tank at the stage door.
If I'm not mistaken,
Marco and Zampa are in the corridor now.
Nonsense. They're not in my show.
I thought they were, particularly when I saw old Fergus.
- Er, I think...
- Who is old Fergus?.
A professor of the Zoological Society.
Mad about aquatic mammals.
Jeff, you must go out front.
I don't want you to miss this.
- Can't I carry her?.
- No, Barclay will do that.
Good luck.
Thank you.
Good luck, dearest... Caroline.
She knows! She knows what I am.
- I'm in a trap!
- No, never.
- Let me have a look-see.
- Hurry! Hurry!
- We're imprisoned.
- Try the corridor.
What am I going to do?.
They shan't get you! They shan't!
Caroline!

- Good evening.
- Colonel Barclay Sutton.
- Good evening.
Hello, Barclay.
How very nice to see you again.
I've come to whisk you off your feet.
Whatever for?.
Nervous?. yes, a little.
I've never been on a public stage before. you'll be all right.
The audience will adore you.
This way, Colonel.
Now, love.
Hope it all works out.
See you one day soon.
Hello, Bonzo! Hello, Trixie.
There you are.
- Bye-bye.
SEAL: Bye-bye!
Hello.
Good luck.
Bere!
- Oh, Miranda!
- I've had a terribly narrow squeak.
Bere, they found me out.
They'll be after you in speedboats!
They won't. Caroline's up there.
She's taken over.
- Can she sing?.
- Not a note.
Signor Mantalini will now play for us the celebrated cello solo entitled La Violette.
The Violin.
Signor Mantalini.
- Infernal machine.
Woo-hoo!
Where are you, love?.
Wonderful, Catch it. you just sing into it like this.
# I'm Maria the matador's mother
They'll think you're singing up here.
All right?. I'll send it down.
Here it comes. Catch it!
Got itg?. Good!
Lovely!
Good luck!
If only Caroline could fall in love with one of the men, we'd keep the house in the family.
I do so hope it could be Jeff. you should worry. you'll be back in our nice semi-detached cave any day now. you're so cold-blooded, Bere.
It's just that I know which side my eels are jellied, that's all.
Think she'll break out our way, Bill?.
Can't say. Never handled one of these mermaid jobs before.
What's that?.
A blinkin' seal. I saw his whiskers.
Good evening, Sergeant.
Are you busy?. (Giggles)
Here, Bill. She's here. In a hat.
- What's that?.
- A mermaid! In a hat.
It was a seal, I told you.
Good evening, Inspector!
Coming for a stroll?.
Go away!
Go away!
She nicked my hel...

Ladies and gentlemen.
Ladies and gentlemen, please, I'm so sorry.
I must apologise for this awful upset.
But you have clear proof now of something
I have known for the past three days.
The extraordinary performance that you have witnessed is due to the fact that Miss Trewella is not a woman, but a mermaid!
- Mermaid, show your tail!
A regular red-hot mammal.
Barclay, what happened?.
I don't know.
The whole thing's extremely fishy to me.
I think you and I had better walk home.
What's the matter?.
Nothing. Why?.
For a moment, you seemed to be like you were before your accident.
I'll never be like that again.
Resync: Xenzai[NEF]
RETAIL Sub
I say there ain't no monster!
But we need men, and just to treat you fair and square, we're payin' double wages and a bonus from Frisco to Shanghai and back, all found.
All dead, you mean,
Don't sign with him, mates.
You can't buy off the monster with double wages and a bonus.
You'll never get back to Frisco to collect your pay.
I got a man here that sailed on the Golden Arrow and lived to tell about it.
Come on, Billy.
Tell 'em what you saw, Bill.
It was the monster, all right.
A cable's length long from beak to tail.
And it came a-bellerin' out of the night with one big eye like a lighthouse.
Whoosh,
We was throwed into starboard,
Ka-rumph,
We were smashed to port.
And then... it come up at midships and broke our backs and sunk us --
40 poor sailor men drowned dead.
The point is, this thing is a ship killer!
And it's a miracle old Billy's alive today.
Tell 'em about its teeth, Billy.
As big as a mainsail,
I swear it.
And its breath --
Ooh, its breath was like a furnace!
Ooh, you got a pretty strong breath yourself, my easy-talkin' friend.
You mind answering a few questions?
I'm a harpooner by trade, and monsters interest me -- all kinds.
Keep away from him, you noisy sea lawyer!
Just want to smell his breath.
I can already smell yours.
Phew!
Boiled down for his oils, lads, there'd be free grog for all hands!
If we could swallow it on top of his --
There! There they are!
- Here!
- Come on,
Stop it!
Come on, Casey.
This is no place for a clergyman's son.
Hey!
Hey, Daphne, come on,
Let's shove off!
- Oh,
- Oh,
Hey! What are you guys doin' to me?!
Don't bother unloading.
Sailing's been canceled.
Canceled again?
This is ridiculous.
We'll see about this.
Driver, you wait here.
Yes, sir.
Is it true about the sailing being canceled?
Unfortunately, yes,
Professor Aronnax.
The crew deserted this morning.
But we just have to get to Saigon.
Isn't there some other ship?
Not a thing.
I'm sorry.
Next.
Halfway around the world from Paris, and -- and now this happens.
There's nothing we can do about it.
No.
Except pack and unpack.
It's all I've been doing now for a month.
Oh, professor?
At any rate, San Francisco will have the honor of your company a while longer.
I'm from The Bulletin.
These gentlemen are from
The Globe and The Post.
- How do you do?
- Gentlemen.
We're interested in your opinion of this monster.
My opinion?
Frankly, it's rather low at the moment.
But actually, gentlemen,
I don't know any more about it than you do.
Oh, professor... uh, just a moment.
Yes?
Professor, what does the National Museum in Paris think about it?
I cannot answer that.
Professor, we heard this, uh, expedition of yours was to gather facts about the monster.
I'm afraid you were misinformed.
My reasons for going to the
Orient are purely scientific -- if I ever get there.
Professor, doesn't the giant narwhal reach a length of 80 feet?
Why don't you ask a fish?
If we could go deep enough, we'd all be surprised at the creatures down there.
Well, could such a creature destroy a ship or drag it under?
Well, it might if it were big enough.
Don't you print that.
Please be careful, professor.
Well, gentlemen, I shall prepare a statement later.
You do not deny, then, that such a monster could exist. ls that correct?
I'm not denying anything.
Are you sure?
Hey, what are you drawing there?
A sketch of the monster.
Thank you, professor.
- Good day.
- Back to the hotel, driver.
- Yes, sir.
- Good day, sir.
Now put the wings on it.
Look what they've done to me.
I made no such claims as these.
Look at this drawing.
I knew it.
"Living horrors of the deep were described today by Professor Aronnax of the Paris National Museum."
Why, this is the most far-fetched nonsense yet.
Far-fetched?
I think the proportions are about right on the monster.
Hmm?
You're not serious, professor?
Oh, I don't mean flying off with a ship in its mouth.
But the general size...
You know, come to think of it, it is a rather interesting conception.
Excuse me,
Professor Aronnax.
Oh, no.
No more reporters.
You've done damage enough.
Professor is very busy now.
But I'm not a reporter.
I represent the United States government.
United States government?
May I come in?
Will he come in?
Of course, sir.
Uh, please do come in,
Mr. Howard.
- Of course.
- Thank you.
I'll be brief, professor.
I understand that your destination is the Orient and that you've been delayed.
What would you say if we could get you there, but by a roundabout route, a cruise of three or four months through the South Seas?
Would you accept?
Well, uh, I would be interested, yes, naturally.
Uh, sit down.
Thank you.
I can see no reason why you and your apprentice shouldn't consider yourselves guests of the United States government until we can set you ashore at Saigon, do you?
May I ask, uh, why have you honored the professor this way?
Well, I think the honor is ours.
As the foremost authority on the sea and its mysteries, you can be an excellent observer.
Your observations will greatly influence public opinion, and we can either confirm or deny certain rumors.
I knew it -- concerns the monster. ls that true?
Very much so.
And according to the papers, you seem to believe the rumors, professor.
Oh, no. The professor has been misquoted outrageously.
Yes, I'm afraid
I was misquoted.
However, I have an open mind on the subject.
All the better.
Your reports would be unbiased.
You see, other nations besides ours are forming expeditions, but I like to think ours has the advantage if for no other reason than you might consent to join us.
Well, it's, uh, very kind of you, uh...
We accept.
Good.
And now, professor, if you don't mind,
I'd like you to come downstairs and meet Captain Farragut.
He's in command of the warship upon which you're sailing.
And I might add that he has some rather strong ideas on the subject of sea monsters.
You mean that his mind is not open?
Most emphatically not.
We headed south, and excitement ran high.
Every man aboard was on the lookout, and the watch was kept day and night.
Regardless of his own feelings in the matter,
Captain Farragut left nothing to chance.
With traditional thoroughness, the Navy plan was to cut the South Pacific into squares and search each square.
For the first month, we steamed in circles, crossing and recrossing our course.
There was no sign of our quarry.
False alarms were common, and they didn't help our morale.
Blow!
Off the weather bow!
For endless days and nights, we scoured the South Pacific.
Our hopes began to wane.
It came as no surprise when Captain Farragut, on the night of December 8, 1868, summoned us to the wardroom.
Gentlemen, I believe my obligation to this legend has been dispatched.
I offer these charts in evidence.
They represent an accurate record of 3 1/2 months cruising under steam in search of a sea monster.
In my considered opinion, no such monster exists or ever did.
Are you abandoning the search?
There's no other choice, professor.
If we've gained nothing else, we can at least give the lie to those rumors and make the newspapers retract their exaggerations.
It doesn't seem to me we have proved anything one way or the other, Captain.
Well, I don't feel justified in wasting further time.
My decision stands.
We'll set you ashore in Saigon.
Gentlemen.
Cheer up, professor.
You'll forget all about fishing when you see the gals in Saigon.
I thought they promised you a bonus if you harpooned this monster, Mr. Land.
Ah, knowing full well
I couldn't collect it.
When I get back,
I'm shippin' out on the first whaler that'll take me.
I won't get rich, but I won't be sitting around, picking my teeth with my harpoon.
Maybe we are lucky.
It might have sunk us.
You scare me.
Be a good loser, professor.
The fish that got away is always the biggest one.
What a pity, professor.
I know you had visions of that monster mounted in the National Museum.
There was Harpoon Hannah.
Had a face that made you shudder, lips like fishhooks...
And a nose just like a rudder.
Ahoy!
Ship off the starboard bow!
Hard over!
Head for that ship!
First mate, pipe all hands to rescue stations.
Aye, aye, sir.
All hands to rescue stations!
I'm thinkin' she went down with all hands.
Poor devils.
Not a living soul left.
What could have caused such a fearsome explosion?
Black powder and worse -- a whole shipload of the stuff.
What could've set it off, though?
She must've struck something.
Or could it be that something struck the ship?
Huh? What do you mean something struck her?
You're meanin' the monster, ain't ya, mate?
Aye, it might be the monster, all right!
The monster?!
I've seen more monsters in my Aunt Gussie's fishbowl than on this whole cruise!
- Sure, it's the monster!
- It is the monster!
Pipe down on deck!
I must insist, professor, that you keep these fish stories to yourself.
On deck! Floating object off the larboard quarter!
There's the monster!
Drummer boy, beat to general quarters.
Set compressors and prime!
Look alive, there!
Get your range and fire, Carson,
What's the matter?
She's showing us her heel, sir!
Well, hit her in the heels, then, Fire!
Aye, aye, sir.
Run her out smartly!
We hit her, sir!
She's turnin',
She's turnin' around,
Mr. Land, into the longboat with you,
Stand by to lower away.
Professor...hang on,
Hang on,
Hey! Don't leave us!
Help!
Help!
Help!
They are the same.
They cannot help.
But they must!
Help!
Help!
Help!
Can you see anything -- anything at all?
No.
Wait till this fog lifts.
I'm getting numb all over.
Look, professor.
T-There's something over there.
What is it?
I don't know.
It -- It looks like the monster.
I don't care what it is, as long as it floats.
Who could have conceived such a miracle?
A submarine boat.
You mean a submerging boat?
But this is incredible.
Men have dreamed about such miracles.
You know something?
I, I don't like this at all.
Ahoy!
Is anyone aboard?
It...It seems deserted.
I think we are asking for trouble, professor.
Why don't we wait?
Maybe -- Maybe somebody will come up.
No. If we wait, this thing is liable to sink under us.
Huh?
It's quite able to, you know.
Hello? ls anyone down there?
Why... it's as bright as day, and it isn't oil or gas, either.
There is great genius behind all this.
Yes, and great evil.
Don't forget this -- this is an agent of destruction.
Hello?
Hello?
Ahoy! Anybody there?
Ahoy, there!
Is anybody aboard?
Did you hear that, professor?
Somebody's calling from the outside.
Come on,
Wait.
Look at this.
Give me a hand with this line, mate.
Grab this oar.
Why, Ned, it's you,
Well, I'll be.
Anybody else get off?
Yes. The professor is down below.
Well, he really got his monster, didn't he?
You know, the ship seems deserted, but I have a feeling not for too long, and... and personally, I'm in no mood to meet the owners.
I'm not anxious to get in their company myself.
I'll take my chances in the open sea, if it's all the same with you.
My sentiment exactly.
Let me call the professor.
Here. Give me a hand first.
Grab that oar.
We got to flop this over.
Hold it.
Well, I'll be.
I've never seen a barge like this before.
Hey, this looks like the galley.
Cook's day off, too.
Let me call the professor.
Professor?
Professor?
Professor?
Can you hear me?
Professor?
Professor?
Professor?
Profess--
Professor, where are you?
Hello. I, I'm in here.
Where?
I...didn't think
I'd ever see you again.
What is it?
Burial ceremony... under the sea.
You know, Ned Land is here with a boat.
Yes, yes.
That tall one must be the leader.
They -- They'll be coming back any moment!
Go on,
Get away!
Help!
Help!
Search the boat.
Aye, sir.
Come with me.
Take him,
Sink that longboat!
All right.
Mind your shovin', mate.
You are from the warship that attacked me, are you not?
Yes.
We were under the impression that this was a monster, not a craft of human invention.
This is Ned Land, master harpooner; my apprentice, Conseil; and I am Pierre Aronnax of the Paris National Museum.
Professor Aronnax.
I've heard of you and studied your writings.
It is fortunate that your background differs slightly from that of your companions in crime.
You may remain.
Take the others on deck.
Wait a minute!
Wait a minute!
What do you want to do with us on deck?
I did not invite you here.
You came as an enemy to destroy me.
But that is not true.
They've done no harm.
Look, don't blame us because the warship shelled you.
I demand a fair trial,
You've had your trial.
The sea brought you.
The sea shall have you back.
Mind your shovin',
Easy, mate!
But you cannot do this!
This is not civilized,
I'm not what is called a civilized man, professor.
I have done with society for reasons that seem good to me.
Therefore,
I do not obey its laws.
But I am as guilty as they are!
But...
I will grant you that both of them and me, too, enlisted to track down what we thought to be a monster, but in that case, we are no more guilty than the rest of the world.
I would consider that guilty enough.
You have a great deal to learn, professor.
Your book is brilliant... but it lacks scope.
You have carried your work as far as terrestrial science permits.
The real story of the ocean depths begins where you left off -- wonders that defy my powers of description...
The secrets that are mine alone... but which I would be willing to share with you.
At the expense of my companions' lives?
I'm sorry.
You would have to choose between them and me.
Then I cannot accept.
Professor,
I regret your choice.
Take him up... and secure for sea.
Aye, sir.
But...
All stations ready.
Prepare for diving.
Yes, sir.
All stations ready.
Prepare for diving.
Ahead slow.
What's he up to, professor?
I don't know.
- Trim your forward ballast.
- Trim your forward ballast.
Three degrees down.
Three degrees down.
All engines stop.
Service and stand by.
Pick up those two men in the water.
Aye, sir.
What about the other one?
Take them all below and confine them to quarters.
I found out what I wanted to know.
Esmay.
There.
There.
There.
Now kiss.
Now off you go.
Off you go, Esmay.
Come in, gentlemen.
Be seated, please.
Thank you.
Professor.
You may serve them.
Your clothes are being dried and will be returned to you shortly.
In the meantime, avail yourselves of my humble hospitality.
"Humble," he calls it.
Hey, you do right well for yourself, mate.
You may call me
Captain Nemo.
I'd like to express our gratitude, Captain.
We are grateful to be alive.
I want none of your gratitude.
You're all under strictest probation, and I'd advise you not to attempt escape.
You understand your position?
Well, I don't know,
Captain.
Prisoner has a right to escape, hasn't he?
That is correct.
And a guest don't need to.
Say, I guess that makes us a little bit of both, huh?
Ha ha ha --
Consider that a fortunate compromise, then, Mr. Land.
I tolerate no guests aboard The Nautilus, and you already know the fate of prisoners.
The food is delicious, isn't it, professor?
Oh, very good.
Never tasted better.
There's a fork on your left, Mr. Land -- or aren't you accustomed to utensils?
I'm indifferent to 'em.
May I ask how you are able to set such a table as this,
Captain?
These dishes come entirely from my ocean kitchen.
There is nothing here of the Earth.
How remarkable.
This tastes like veal.
The flavor deceives you.
That is fillet of sea snake.
Hmm?
I suppose this isn't lamb, then.
That is brisket of blowfish with sea squid dressing, basted in barnacles.
It's very good.
In fact, it's better than lamb.
Yes, my cook excels in preparing these various products.
You're not finished, are you?
Well, uh, just the main course.
Uh, pass the cream, mate, huh?
The cream is, of course, milk from the giant sperm whale.
And those delicious fruits you are eating are actually preserves made from sea cucumbers.
Well, I'd never have guessed it.
They are excellent.
Eat your pudding, Mr. Land.
I ain't sure it's puddin'.
What is it?
It's my own recipe -- saute of unborn octopus.
Nothin' here's fit to eat.
Saute of unborn octopus.
Since we are nearing the island of Crespo, you will have an opportunity of selecting your own food.
Y-You mean we're gettin' off this submarine?
For a brief hunting expedition.
Well, that -- that suits me fine.
Me too.
When do we start, mate -- uh, Captain?
Almost immediately.
These two will join the expedition.
Will you prepare them?
Aye, sir.
Accept one of these cigars, professor.
Thank you.
Delightful smoke.
Different somehow.
Havana?
Seaweed.
Well, I cannot accuse you of not making us comfortable, Captain.
In a way, though, I feel like a condemned man who has eaten his last dinner.
And a very good one, too.
Thank you.
Uh, I am still curious as to the reason you spared our lives.
In your case,
I wanted to test your loyalty to your companions.
I may have use for such misplaced devotion.
Misplaced?
It comforts me to know that your life was not too dear a price to pay for love of your fellow man.
I'm afraid
I don't understand.
At the moment,
I don't intend that you should.
But I may have use for you.
And until I make up my mind, you should find ample diversion here.
You have literature, art treasures, my collections, and even music if you so desire.
Ah.
We're almost at the island of Crespo.
All this was once an island.
Although it has now sunk, it is nonetheless fertile.
We do our hunting and farming here.
Underwater?
The sea supplies all my wants.
Fine way to go huntin'.
I knew there'd be a catch to this.
Seems you can't do anything on this boat without getting wet.
Hey, I feel like I'm keepin' a fish out of work.
Ha ha ha ha!
Hey, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Where you goin' with this?
Hey, what are you gonna do with that, huh?
An expedition from The Nautilus.
The pair you see trying to keep pace are your companions.
It's a new experience for them.
They'll learn quickly.
Would you like to join them?
Indeed, yes.
I, I would like to meet these wonders face-to-face.
Very well.
I'll introduce them to you.
A strange twilight world opened up before me, and I felt as the first man to set foot on another planet, an intruder in this mystic garden of the deep.
Captain Nemo and I were not alone.
There were hunters and farmers from the submarine, gathering a harvest at the bottom of the sea.
I could only marvel at his ingenuity and envy him his rule over this forgotten reach of nature.
Here, in abundance, were various substances necessary to sustain life -- an underwater larder filled to overflowing, and all Captain Nemo's for the taking.
If I hadn't seen it with my own eyes,
I wouldn't have believed it.
Hey, Captain. Captain, we left a treasure out there -- a whole chest of gold, silver, and diamonds.
You were sent to get food, not treasure.
You can't eat pieces of eight.
Eat? I can eat anytime.
You place an absurd value on the cheapest of human commodities.
Aboard The Nautilus, we use such baubles for ballast.
Ballast?
Well, I could sure lighten this ship.
The greatest treasures of all, Mr. Land, are a sound mind and a full belly.
Henceforth, when you're sent for food, don't stoop to pick up pennies.
You've been pickin' 'em up, and picking 'em up good --
"ballast."
Ned, you forget yourself.
Don't try my patience,
Mr. Land.
Rather than watch your every move,
I know a much easier solution to the problem.
Cryin' waste!
Ohhhh.
Ned, the professor wants to see you.
Yeah?
Close the door, please.
Don't think for a minute that was an empty threat he made.
You are going to get us all killed if you keep on antagonizing him.
Look at the trouble you got into wandering off that way.
Why did you do it?
Ask him.
He went with me.
That was scientific interest.
I, I had no idea he was after treasure.
Oh, no?
Stop it!
You even helped carry the chest out, you liar.
We mustn't quarrel among ourselves.
We must stay together.
It's our only chance.
Chance? For what?
Oh, I know what you want, professor.
This crazy iron skillet's turned your head.
You want to play a waitin' game, hoping to learn ol' Nemo's secrets.
Well, I believe we owe the world that much, Ned.
Have you a better plan?
Yeah --
I want to get off.
Of course, I don't mind goin' with my pockets full.
I can't believe you could be so foolish.
Why not? He's got a king's ransom aboard here.
And don't call it stealin', because that's the way he got it.
If we could take this thing over, we'd be rich.
I'd have a ship of me own, and you wouldn't have to be starvin' along on a professor's pay.
Don't look at me with those soft-boiled eggs.
I caught the glint of gold in them when that chest busted.
Ned, listen to me.
I want you to forget this idea and promise me that you won't start anything on your own.
I won't promise that, professor.
But at least try my way first.
I know I can win the captain's confidence, but I need time and I need your help.
Can I count on you?
All right.
Well,
I'll go this far --
I won't try any one-man mutiny...yet.
It is the best way.
Believe me.
There's one thing you oughta know, professor --
Nemo's cracked.
I have yet to see the day you can make a deal with a mad dog.
So while you're feedin' him sugar,
I'll be figurin' a plan to muzzle him.
Fool.
He simply cannot grasp the significance of all this.
Here we are within reach of the most fabulous discoveries of all time, and he patters of gold, escape, trivialities, nonsense.
Well, that depends upon your point of view, professor.
What do you mean by that?
I just think that Ned values his life above scientific achievement, that's all.
His life means nothing.
Nor does mine or yours compared to what's behind all this.
We can't have him crossing Nemo.
Today we encountered a fearsome storm.
An ordinary vessel would've suffered heavy damage.
Safe and serene, The Nautilus cruised beneath the tempest.
There was much to occupy me, so I left my apprentice to deal with Ned Land.
Although he had apparently settled down,
I knew he bore constant watching.
Right, sir.
I'll check all decks below.
Ooh.
Cute, isn't she?
As the voyage continued,
The Nautilus and its motive power excited my utmost curiosity.
At my host's invitation,
I inspected the ship.
He seemed determined to show me everything.
We went to the very heart of the vessel.. the propulsion unit.
It was apparent that
Captain Nemo had discovered what mankind has always sought -- the veritable dynamic power of the universe.
This secret alone gave him mastery of the sea.
I can hardly believe how one could conceive and build such a craft and, in a single stroke, harness power beyond the wildest dreams of science.
Why, such a secret could revolutionize the world.
Or destroy it.
See how peaceful it is here.
The sea is everything -- an immense reservoir of nature, where I roam at will.
With seeming indifference,
Captain Nemo held the key to the future of the world.
As I studied him,
I became aware that powerful forces were at work within this strange man.
Think of it.
On the surface, there is hunger and fear.
Men still exercise unjust laws.
They fight and tear one another to pieces.
A mere few feet beneath the waves, their reign ceases, their evil drowns.
Here on the ocean floor is the only independence.
Here I am free.
Imagine what would happen if they controlled machines such as a submarine boat.
Far better that they think there's a monster and hunt me with harpoons.
After traveling 10,000 leagues under the sea,
I still had not solved the mystery of Captain Nemo.
But when one day he asked me to go ashore with him,
I felt, at long last,
I was to have my answer.
The prison camp of Rura Pente, the white man's grave.
But I thought it had been abolished.
Nothing is abolished that turns a profit to that hated nation.
You'll see better what I mean through this.
What is in those sacks they are carrying?
Nitrates and phosphate for ammunition -- the seeds of war.
They're loading a full cargo of death.
And when that ship takes it home, the world will die a little more.
I was once one of those pitiful wretches you see down there.
Look at it again, professor.
I don't want you to forget what you've seen here today.
I've seen enough.
It's burned everlastingly in my memory.
I did not escape from there alone.
There were others.
Most of them are still with me.
The crew of The Nautilus?
They're dedicated men with a plan for living, but also a plan for dying.
We seized one of their ships and fled beyond maps -- a place known to me simply as Vulcania.
Vulcania.
Sounds remote.
Remote and useful.
It was there that we built
The Nautilus.
You will have the privilege of seeing all this firsthand.
When our mission is completed,
The Nautilus is going home.
They're getting up steam, sir.
Very good.
That ship that flies no flag sails with the tide.
But the evil in its hold will never reach its destination.
You have your orders.
Aye, sir.
Go to your stations.
Go below, professor.
You are going to sink that ship?
I said, "Go below."
Stay in your quarters.
Stand by, engines.
Half ahead.
Collision speed, Full,
Collision speed, Full,
Professor...
Are you all right?
All those men -- they -- they didn't even have a chance.
They were sailors, same as me -- slaughtered by that monster you're tryin' to make friends with.
Ned, don't.
I don't know how you feel, professor, but I feel like a knife that's just stabbed a friend in the back.
Go to your quarters.
I've had a bellyful.
Damage report, sir.
Rudder and starboard diving planes disabled.
Muster a repair party.
We'll make temporary repairs here.
Aye, sir.
I asked you to leave, professor.
You also asked me ashore to show me man's inhumanity to man.
Why? To justify this?
You are not only a murderer, you are a hypocrite.
The proof lies out there.
You call that murder?!
Well, I see murder, too, not written on those drowned faces out there but on the faces of dead thousands!
There are the assassins, the dealers in death,
I am the avenger. ls murder a right reserved for that hated nation that has taken everything else from me -- everything but my secret, the secret of my submarine boat and the energy that propels it?
They tried.
They cast me in a prison, and when they failed...
When they failed, they tortured my wife and young son to death.
Do you know the meaning of love, professor?
I believe I do.
What you fail to understand... is the power of hate.
It can fill the heart... as surely as love can.
I'm sorry for you.
It's a bitter substitute.
Oh, the -- the explosions scattered everything all over the place.
I was just trying to tidy up.
Professor, I-I'd like to speak to you.
About what?
Well, I, I believe --
I believe things have gone far enough.
Murder means nothing to him.
I, I think he enjoys it.
You're sure of that, are you?
Quite sure?
Well, I, I can only judge him by -- by what I observed.
It is not your place to judge.
You don't know anything about the captain.
He's already said that he has use for me, but what's more important, the world has a use for him, and I must make him understand that.
And when he does,
I assure you that he will judge himself far more harshly than you ever can. ls that clear?
Whatever you say, Captain.
Now, please go out and leave me alone.
What did you call me?
Captain?
Yes, I did.
And I must say there is a certain resemblance.
Seen enough?
I want to talk to you.
You little spyin' hyena.
Did the professor put you up to this?
It's the professor
I want to tell you about.
You were right.
Nemo has won him over completely.
You bet I was right.
And I was right about you spyin' on me.
Look, Ned,
I, I've known all along that you were stealing food and treasure.
I didn't tell a soul.
I was glad you did it.
We may need it.
We? Since when do I need you?
- We need each other.
- Ha!
Ned,
I, I want to be friends.
"I want to be friends"?
I want to escape.
So do I -- with you.
And we have to save the professor, in spite of himself.
You once said you had a plan.
Have you?
Yeah, I got a plan.
Well?
Trouble is, it won't work.
I can't figure how they navigate this barge!
Nothing's written down -- no courses, no bearings, nothin',
If we can only figure where we're headin', we'd have a chance.
- That's no problem.
- Hmm?
When I was reading the professor's journal,
I, I learned about Nemo's plans.
We're heading for a place called Vulcania.
Vulcania?
Yeah, that's -- that's Nemo's base.
Well, why didn't you say so?
This is what I've been waitin' for!
- It was?
- Sure!
Vulcania...
Well, I gotta take a look at those charts.
Why not?
I'll need all hands.
You keep a watch.
Aye, sir.
Keep your eye peeled for the mate.
Aye, sir.
Hey, Ned. Ned.
Put them back.
He's coming.
- Shh, Shh,
- All right, all right.
Hurry up.
Hurry up. He's coming.
Phew.
That was close, mate.
Very.
Hey...
This is Nemo's cabin.
Yeah.
He does do right well for himself.
Maybe...
Ned, let's get out of here.
If they find us in his cabin, we --
What is it?
Quick, give me a pen and paper, quick.
- What for?
- I think I found somethin'.
Ned...
See? All the distances are measured from that point.
That's right.
It must be.
Get me those calendars, quick.
Let's see if I can work this out now.
Longitude...
Quiet. Quiet.
Quiet!
Please be quiet, will ya?
Don't bark so much.
Shh,
Here, here.
Have a cigar.
Hey, she likes 'em,
You want another?
Give me a kiss.
You have quite a way with animals, huh?
I do better with women, and they don't eat cigars --
Shh, Be quiet!
You feed her. Here.
All right.
I'll give you a cigar.
All right.
Here, have one. You see?
Yes, I love you, too.
I'll find you some more.
Yes. I'll find you some more.
Stop playin' with her.
- I'm not playing.
- Shh, shh, shh,
Here.
You just be quiet.
Be a nice girl.
Here. Eat them slowly.
You don't have to inhale them.
Here.
We'll complete repairs at base.
He's comin',
Let's go.
Resume speed at 50 fathoms.
Resume speed at 50 fathoms.
Esmay.
I've got to do some research.
I'll need some specimens.
Get 'em.
Specimens? What kind?
The ones in bottles.
Go on, beat it.
And don't get caught.
No.
Well, Ned, you've got everything here, from the rarest nudibranchs to oysters.
Oysters are out of season.
Dump 'em in the sink -- all of 'em.
I just want the bottles.
You can't do that.
These are priceless.
Ned, you're not thinking of putting messages into these bottles?
Why, that went out with Robinson Crusoe.
You've forgotten, this is the 19th century.
Somethin' else I forgot.
Ooh,
That's for spyin' on me.
Don't let me catch you paddin' the shadow of my stern again.
Remember that.
I don't like bashin' anybody, but you had it comin', lad.
And I thought we were friends.
Sure we're friends.
Go ahead. Hit me.
Hmm?
- Hit me.
- Do you mean that?
Sure, go ahead.
You can't miss it.
Ooh, 
Now we are friends.
Oh, all right, shipmate.
Ooh. 
Well, now I'll tell you what I had on my mind.
This may be old stuff, tossin' messages off in bottles and settin' 'em adrift, but I've heard of it workin'.
- Alcohol.
- Very pure alcohol.
We'll just drain the pollywogs out and save the grog.
But, Ned...
It's -- It's priceless.
Ohh.
Anyhow -- here, hold this, lad -- this chap I knew got shipwrecked in the Bahamas -- him and a lady passenger alone on an island.
Well, they had plenty of time on their hands, so they began writin' notes, puttin' 'em in old rum bottles, and settin' 'em adrift.
One of them got through, too, and they was rescued.
Oh.
Easy. What is it?
I swallowed it.
There was a flabellina oculina in there.
Poor thing.
Flabellina oculina.
She won't answer her helm, sir.
Astern full,
- What's happened now?
- We seem to have run aground.
Hey, what's happened?
An accident, Captain?
An incident. Our faulty rudders put us on a reef.
The tide will float us free by evening.
Professor, we're off the coast of New Guinea.
Would you like to go ashore?
No, thank you.
The last time we went ashore, it was a prelude to murder.
- Check for leaks.
- Aye, sir.
Throwin' away a chance like that -- the professor's losin' his ballast.
Smell it -- sweet as an angel's kiss.
Dry land, mate, coconuts, mangoes, and... native girls hungry for affection.
I'd give anything to shake hands with a tree again.
So would I.
And so would the professor.
I, I know how badly he wants to collect specimens, but he won't ask any favors from Nemo.
What's wrong with you goin' instead?
Nothing.
What about you?
Me?
I'm a collectin' fool.
There's no harm in asking.
No harm at all, mate.
Captain, I, I wondered, as long as the professor is not going ashore, if I could go in his place.
I-I'd like to collect some specimens and -- and take some notes.
You feel qualified?
Qualified?
Why, for years, the professor and I have been working together.
And I can row, sir -- got a strong back.
And a strong desire to escape.
Who, me? I'm no deserter.
Happy to be aboard, sir.
Very well.
Permission granted.
Thank you, sir.
But stay on the beach.
The natives over there are cannibals.
They eat liars with the same enthusiasm as they eat honest men.
Break out the skip.
Aye, sir.
Break out the skip.
Shove off!
I don't see any native girls hungry for affection.
Take it easy.
Hey, Ned, we're not supposed to leave the beach.
Who's leavin' it?
Hey! 
- Come here, quick!
- What is it?
Look -- a trail through the jungle.
You had this in mind all the time.
You want to escape.
What do you say, mate?
It's a cinch.
I don't think so, or Nemo wouldn't have let us come ashore.
Don't forget the cannibals.
Oh, belay the cannibals.
He said that to scare us.
Besides, I, I couldn't leave the professor.
I figured that.
Just look at me.
I can't get through that jungle.
You'll go faster alone.
Hope you make it, Ned.
I'll make it, all right, and I'll have every gunboat in the Navy huntin' ol' Nemo.
Just wait.
We'll be laughin' about this, havin' a drink together in Frisco.
Good luck, Ned.
Ohh. Give my best to the professor.
Hey!
Hey! Wait for me!
Hey!
Wait for me!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Natives -- cannibals.
Hundreds of cannibals.
Captain, Captain, scores of boats with cannibals.
- Captain, we're under attack!
- Naturally.
Since you invaded their privacy, they have every right to invade ours.
They're coming aboard,
Captain.
Get me a harpoon, quick.
Close the hatch,
I'll give the commands on this boat, Mr. Land.
Stand aside.
Aye, sir.
I gotta see this.
This is amazing.
Hey, Captain, that's one way to keep guests from dropping in.
A mild charge of electricity,
Mr. Land -- not very hospitable, but harmless.
And speaking of hospitality, may I say that you have abused mine for the last time?
Well, how's that?
You've continuously disobeyed my orders.
Who, me?
I told you once the fate of prisoners.
But since you insist on being treated as one,
I have no choice but to oblige you.
- Take him in charge.
- Aye, sir.
Now, wait a minute.
What's this all about, Captain?
You left the beach with the intention of escaping.
The only reason you came back is because the natives forced you to.
You're going to regret that choice, Mr. Land.
MAN #2 : Ship rounding the headland, sir.
When we clear this reef,
I'll see that you trouble my existence no longer.
I should have taken my chances with the cannibals.
A warship.
- A warship?!
- Put him under guard below.
Take him below.
All engines ready.
We must break free of the reef.
Aye, sir.
Lighten ship and drop all ballasts.
Get below! They'll be shelling us in a moment.
Aye, sir.
Astern full.
Astern full it is, sir.
Hold it! 
Let me out of this!
Let me out of this glory hole!
Professor, professor!
A warship, professor.
Warship?!
We're breaking out.
- Man the watertight doors.
- Aye, sir.
Man the watertight door.
Hey, they're -- they're shutting the door.
Wait!
Wait!
Let us out!
Wait! We are in here!
Wait!
Take the wheel.
How much water in the power compartment?
5 feet and rising, sir.
Break out a spare shaft.
- Break out a spare shaft.
- We must use leverage.
Bring it thwartships.
Put the aft end down to the leak.
And lift with the hoist.
Take up the slack.
Make a strain.
There's no pressure.
The dials are not moving.
We've gone too deep.
Stand by with braces.
Aye, sir.
Quick, braces.
Braces in place, sir.
Man your stations.
Start engines.
The air will clear now that the fans are operating again.
Are you all right?
Yes, thank you -- much better.
Have we stopped sinking?
Fortunately...
There are limits beyond which man and his puny efforts cannot survive.
We exceeded them by 5,000 feet.
We are deeper now than man has ever been before.
Giant squid astern, sir!
Emergency speed, all engines!
We're found,
Full repeller charge.
Aye, sir.
Try another charge.
Sorry, sir.
All elements burned out.
Then we shall have to fight on the surface.
Assemble all hands in the charge room.
Aye, sir.
Drop all ballasts.
Diving controls, full "out" position.
We'll be fighting at close quarters with the most tenacious of all sea beasts.
Stay clear of the tentacles.
They'll seize anything within reach and hang on to the death.
The only vital spot is directly between the eyes.
40 feet and surfacing, sir.
Stand by.
Stay back!
Quick, the stern hatch.
Take your men down the starboard side!
You men, come with me!
Give me a harpoon,
I'll work behind it.
Stay back here!
Stand clear!
Throw me another arrow!
Watch it!
Watch it! Aah,
Your hand,
No! No!
Aaah, Ugh,
Ugh, Ugh,
Ugh,
Ugh,
Well, I'll be --
Are you hurt bad, mate?
What's up?
What happened?
Aaah,
Mr. Land...
You saved my life.
Why?
That's a good question.
Well, there's only one thing a fella can do when he's made a mistake as big as this.
What?
Get drunk.
Huh?
Yep, glad to hear -- see you like music, too, huh?
We got a lot in common.
Thank you, baby.
How 'bout a drink, huh?
Okay. 
Hey, would you like a-a flabellina oculina?
I've tried 'em -- very good.
Ahh,
Try some?
Ahh,
You know, Esmeralda, you're the only one on this barge that understands me.
Give us a kiss.
Your whiskers tickle.
Let me see your whiskers.
Hey, you oughta shave, honey.
You're beginnin' to look like Nemo.
Let's try it again.
Oh, come on.
Let's try it again.
Huh?
Not so loud, Ned.
Not so loud.
Hey, she loves those flabellina oculina!
I am happy you're out of jail, Ned.
Yeah, I got the run of the ship.
Big-hearted Nemo!
Well, the professor's very happy, too.
After all, it's the first time that Nemo has shown any gratitude.
We don't want none of his gratitude!
We don't want none of his gratitude!
This is awful,
You can tell him that for the both of us!
Do we, Esmeralda, huh?
Come on.
We're gonna take a little nap here.
Here -- you lie down there.
Cover yourself up good.
I don't want you to catch cold.
My apprentice tells me you have taken my journal.
May I ask why?
I keep no log on The Nautilus, and I was frankly curious to read your account of the giant squid -- in particular, my narrow escape and rescue.
According to you,
Mr. Land is a hero in the best tradition of cheap fiction.
That can only be true if you consider your life cheap, Captain.
I might have expected you to say that.
Actually, he regrets saving my life as much as I would regret saving his.
The only difference is that I wouldn't have tried.
Then it is that difference that gives Ned Land the human dignity you no longer possess.
May I tell you something?
You seem determined to.
Go ahead.
You protest too much.
I know you were deeply touched by Ned's gesture, but you are ashamed to admit it.
You cannot tolerate the faith in humanity, because if you do, all this -- the structure of your very existence, which you built on hate and vengeance -- all this will collapse around the naked lie of your life.
You are a beaten man at war with the dictates of his heart.
And you are a very gullible man, professor.
- Gullible?
- Yes.
You're too easily swayed by sentiment, individual good deeds over bad, the crude extremes.
You oversimplify matters.
The world is more complex than that, and good must not be measured on a scale as small as Mr. Land's brash heroics.
What he would do one day, he would gladly undo the next.
To be of benefit, goodness must be constant, forever building.
It must have strength.
I'm afraid what you seek is perfection.
You will never find it.
I have already found it...
...here.
It is the world outside that is imperfect.
If men and nations had this goodness that I speak of,
I would be willing to share all this -- my records, everything.
Have you considered sharing it?
That's the only reason that you're alive today, professor.
From the moment that you came aboard The Nautilus,
I had hoped that you would be the key to a plan that I had in mind.
I had intended using you as an emissary.
But now I don't know. ls it that you don't trust me?
No!
But you are ever the optimist.
Do you really believe they would lay down their arms and abolish their slave camps?
Yes, I think
I could persuade them.
Let me try.
We're nearing Vulcania.
I want you to see the extent of these secrets for which they have hounded me, the knowledge which costs the lives of those dearest to me, the power which is still mine -- enough energy to lift mankind from the depths of Hell into Heaven... or destroy it.
Perhaps then you will feel less inclined to barter such a prize.
We will discuss it at that time.
We've raised the island, sir.
Why have we stopped?
There are warships ahead.
Bearing what flag?
No flag, sir.
Very well.
There's your answer, professor.
We've been ambushed by the very forces that you wish to trade with.
Their boarding parties have already landed.
This is a dark hour for history, professor.
They'll be over the summit in half an hour, sir.
I estimate 20 minutes.
Everything must be destroyed before they reach the lagoon.
Ready to dive.
Aye, sir.
Diving stations!
Ahead full,
Diving stations!
Four degrees down,
All engines stop!
- Break out the skiff!
- Aye, sir.
What's all the excitement,
Captain?
What is it, professor?
We are at the base, and the island is surrounded by warships.
By warships?
Warships!
Shove off!
Have everything in readiness aboard,
Aye, sir!
Take cover!
Look!
They're coming,
I'm gonna let 'em know we're here.
No, Ned, Don't!
Hey! Hey!
You up there!
We're friends!
Don't shoot!
We're friends, I tell ya!
We're the ones that threw the bottles over!
Hey! We're friends!
We sent the messages!
That's gratitude for ya.
After all we did for 'em.
Then it was you who decoyed those warships here.
Aye, it was.
Somebody had to strike a blow for freedom.
We did what we thought was right, professor.
Right?!
You fools!
This is going to cost the world the greatest discoveries of all time!
He's gone ashore to destroy everything,
Hey, professor!
Destroy everything?
That sounds like he's gonna plant a bomb or something,
Every man to his station,
Every man to his station,
Stand by engines!
Prepare for diving,
Aye, sir!
Prepare for diving,
Shall I take over?
Half ahead,
Four degrees down.
Ahead full,
Slow our engines.
All controls eight degrees down.
Lash the wheel.
Aye, sir.
Lash the wheel.
Captain.
We are taking The Nautilus down for the last time.
We understand, sir.
And we're with you.
Wait a minute.
I don't understand.
What's that got to do with us?
I am dying, and The Nautilus is dying with me.
Professor.
Yes?
In a matter of minutes, an explosion such as the world has never known will destroy my island... and all its works forever.
That is why I have brought
The Nautilus here... to its last deep resting place.
Here, at least we will die in peace.
Let every man go to his quarters and remain there.
Why do you take us down with you?!
Lock them in their quarters.
Aye, sir.
Take them out!
I don't want to die!
Don't let them do it, professor!
Captain,
Captain, you cannot do this.
There is more at stake here than just our lives.
Yours was a dream of the future come true.
I beg you to reconsider.
A power greater than mine makes that impossible.
But there is hope for the future.
When the world is ready... for a new and better life... all this will someday come to pass... in God's good time.
I'm sorry, Ned.
Don't give up, mate!
We're no part of any suicide pact!
Put him in his cabin.
Ugh,
Ohh,
Ohh, Ugh, Ugh,
Ugh,
Ugh,
Come on,
I've taken over the ship!
Let's get outta here!
We're on the surface, so stand by!
Let's get the skiff out and shove off!
Hey, professor!
Where are you goin'?!
- My journal,
- The island's gonna blow up any second,
I must get my journal,
Shove off!
What's the matter?
Is he hurt?
Hey, we forgot Essy.
Esmeralda, come on,
Quick, quick!
Come on,
Come on, hurry!
In the boat.
Come on, in the boat.
Thar she blows.
Sorry I had to wallop you, professor.
There wasn't time to stop for souvenirs.
Perhaps you did mankind a service, Ned.
There is hope for the future.
And when the world is ready for a new and better life, all this will someday come to pass... in God's good time.
Resync: Xenzai[NEF]
Holy mackerel!
Call headquarters.
Get the lieutenant.
Holy Christmas!
That thing's doing about 4,000!
But that's incredible, sir.
That can't be aircraft.
Must be a buzz bomb.
This is Luckton at Ferris to Charlie Baker.
I have a bogey at 2-0-0 thousand feet.
4-0-0-0 miles an hour.
Reports are coming in from all over the Empire, all over the world.
The government has not yet issued a statement, but there is no question that there actually is a large, unidentified object circling the Earth at incredible speed.
This is Elmer Davis again.
We still don't know what it is or where it comes from, but there's something there.
It's been tracked around the Earth by radar, travelling at a rate of 4,000 miles an hour.
This is not another
"flying saucer" scare.
Scientists and military men are already agreed on that.
Whatever it is, it's something real.
We interrupt this programme to give you a bulletin from a naval unit at sea.
A large object travelling at supersonic speed is headed towards the
East Coast of the United States.
This is HV Kaltenborn speaking.
Here in the nation's capital there is anxiety and concern, but no outward sign of panic.
As a matter of fact, there are signs of normalcy... the beautiful spring weather, the tourist crowds around the public monuments and other buildings.
They're here!
They're here!
They've landed! Over on the Mall!
They've landed!
- Get me the Chief of Staff.
- Thank you. Hold the line, please.
Hello. I want to speak to the President.
I'm sorry, but you'll have to interrupt him.
Good afternoon. This is Drew Pearson.
We bring you this special radio/television broadcast in order to give you the very latest information on an amazing phenomenon... the arrival of a spaceship in Washington.
Government and Defense
Department officials are concerned by reports of panic in several large eastern cities.
I am authorised to assure you that, so far, there is no reasonable cause for alarm.
The rumours of invading armies and mass destruction are based on hysteria, and are absolutely false.
I repeat, these rumours are absolutely false.
The ship, designed for travel outside the Earth's atmosphere, landed in Washington today at 3:47pm Eastern Standard Time.
We still do not know where it came from.
The ship is now resting exactly where it landed two hours ago, and so far there is no sign of life from inside it.
Troops have been rushed across the Potomac River from Fort Myer and have thrown a cordon around the ship.
They are supported by tanks, artillery and machine guns.
Behind the police lines there's a huge crowd of curiosity seekers.
The army has taken every precaution to meet any emergency which may develop.
Every eye, every weapon is trained on the ship.
It's been that way for two hours, and the tension is just beginning...
Just a minute, ladies and gentlemen,
I think something is happening.
We have come to visit you in peace, and with goodwill.
Gort! Deglet ovrosco!
It was a gift for your President.
With this, he could have studied life on the other planets.
Get that ambulance over here.
Take him to Walter Reed Hospital right away.
Mr Harley, sir, from the White House.
- General.
- Right in there, Mr Harley.
My name is Harley,
Secretary to the President.
I've been told you speak our language, and that your name is Mr... Klaatu?
Just Klaatu.
The President conveys his deepest apologies for what happened.
Sit down, Mr Harley.
Thank you.
I'm sure I need hardly point out that your arrival was something of a surprise.
Had you been travelling long?
About five months.
Your months.
You must have come a long way.
About 250 million of your miles.
Naturally, we are very curious to know where you come from.
From another planet.
Let's just say that we're neighbours.
It's hard for us to think of a planet as a neighbour.
I'm afraid in the present situation you'll have to learn to think that way.
- The present situation?
- I mean the reason for my coming here.
We're very curious about that, too.
- Would you care to talk about it?
- I'd be glad to.
Not now, of course, with you alone.
You'd rather talk personally with the President?
This is not a personal matter, Mr Harley.
It concerns all the people on your planet.
I'm not sure I understand.
I want to meet with representatives from all the nations of the Earth.
I'm afraid that would be a little awkward.
It's completely without precedent.
And there are practical considerations... the time involved, the enormous distances.
I travelled 250 million miles.
I appreciate that, but...
I want to be frank with you, Mr...
I mean Klaatu.
Our world at the moment is full of tensions and suspicions.
In the present international situation, such a meeting would be quite impossible.
What about your United Nations?
You know about the United Nations?
We've been monitoring your radio broadcasts for a good many years.
That's how we learned your languages.
I'm sure you recognise from our broadcasts the evil forces that have produced the trouble in our world. Surely...
I'm not concerned, Mr Harley, with the internal affairs of your planet.
My mission here is not to solve your petty squabbles.
It concerns the existence of every last creature on Earth.
Perhaps if you could explain a little...
I intend to explain.
To all the nations, at the same time.
How do we proceed, Mr Harley?
Well, we could call a special meeting of the General Assembly.
But of course, the United Nations doesn't represent all the nations.
Then I suggest a meeting of all the Chiefs of State.
Believe me, you don't understand.
They wouldn't sit down at the same table.
I don't want to resort to threats, Mr Harley.
I merely tell you that the future of your planet is at stake.
I urge that you transmit that message to the nations of the Earth.
I will make that recommendation to the President.
But I must tell you in all honesty,
I'm extremely dubious about the results.
Apparently I'm not as cynical about Earth's people as you are.
I have been dealing in Earth's politics a good deal longer than you have.
Good night, sir.
It is now 2am, and the giant robot still hasn't moved.
Engineers from nearby Fort Belvoir have failed to budge him, and metallurgical experts have found his huge body impregnable.
They're now concentrating on the ship itself, so far with no results.
Getting anyplace, Sergeant?
Oh, no, sir.
This beats me, sir.
I saw the ramp come through the side of the ship, right here.
Now I can't even find a crack.
Oh, Carlson.
What's the report?
No luck, sir. We've tried everything from a blowtorch to a diamond drill.
- What about him?
- He's made out of the same stuff.
- Has he moved, Sergeant?
- No, sir. Not an inch.
This is the toughest material
I ever saw, General.
For hardness and strength, it's out of this world.
I can tell you officially that's where it came from!
The skeletal structure's completely normal.
The tests show the same for major organs... the heart, liver, spleen, kidneys.
Yeah, and the lungs are the same as ours.
That must mean a similar atmosphere, similar pressure.
- How old do you think he is?
- Oh, I'd say 35, 38.
He told me this morning while I was examining him. He's 78.
- Well, I don't believe it.
- Life expectancy is 130.
How does he explain that?
Says their medicine's much more advanced.
He was very nice about it, but he made me feel like a third-class witch doctor.
I removed a bullet from that man's arm yesterday.
Well, what about it?
I just examined the wound, and it's completely healed.
What does he say about it?
Said he put salve on it, stuff he had on him.
What are you gonna do with it?
Take it downstairs and have it analysed.
Then I don't know whether to just get drunk or give up the practice of medicine.
- Afternoon, Mr Harley.
- Good afternoon, gentlemen.
Good afternoon.
I'm glad to see you up and around.
- Thank you. Have you any news?
- Not very good news, I'm afraid.
The President accepted your suggestion, and cabled the invitations for a meeting.
Let me read you some of the replies.
"The Premier wishes to inform the government of the United States that it will be impossible for him to attend the meeting suggested by the President, unless the meeting is held in Moscow."
"The suggestion of the President of the possibility of a meeting in Moscow would be unacceptable to His Majesty's
Government at the present time."
"Representation could be sent only if the meeting were held in Washington."
Well, there you have it.
Now you understand the situation more clearly, perhaps you'd like to discuss it with the President.
I will not speak with any one nation or group of nations.
I don't intend to add my contribution to your childish jealousies and suspicions.
Our problems are very complex, Klaatu.
- You mustn't judge us too harshly.
- I can judge only by what I see.
- Your impatience is quite understandable.
- I'm impatient with stupidity.
- My people have learned to live without it.
- I'm afraid my people haven't.
I am very sorry.
I wish it were otherwise.
Before making any decisions, I think
I should get out among your people, and become familiar with the basis for these strange, unreasoning attitudes.
Under the circumstances,
I'm afraid that's impossible.
I must ask that you don't try to leave the hospital.
Our military people have insisted on this.
I'm sure you understand.
- The man from the spaceship got away!
- What? Get every available man.
(reporter) Hospital authorities refuse to comment on how he managed to escape...
(reporter #2) The descriptions of the creature are denounced as rumour by the police chief.
He's not eight feet tall, as reported, nor does he have tentacles...
(reporter #3) There's no denying a monster is at large, and we are dealing with forces beyond our knowledge and power.
The public is advised to take ordinary precautions and to remain calm as we await...
(reporter #4) Officials have concluded that this ship comes from some other planet.
Thus far, scientists have refused to speak officially on just which planet, until they've had an opportunity to study the ship.
They seem to agree, however, that either
Venus or Mars is the most likely possibility.
Not only are these the closest planets to Earth, but all research to date indicates they are the only two planets capable of sustaining life as we know it.
However, all reputable scientists warn against jumping to hasty conclusions.
Professor Havemeyer of MIT, for example, points out it's possible, in light of our meagre knowledge.
The President has urged all citizens to be on the alert for any information about this man, and to transmit such information immediately to the police, the army or the FBI.
While the President made no effort to minimise the crisis, he urged people all over the country to remain calm.
And I might add, that though this man may be our bitter enemy, he could be also a new-found friend.
- Unfortunately, the only photos we have...
- Mom, do you think I could...?
- Hey, who's that?
-..do not show the man's face.
The President said the entire facilities of the FBI and every other federal agency are being brought to bear.
He pointed out, however, that this is no ordinary manhunt.
He warned "We may be up against powers that are beyond our control... "
- What is it you want?
- My name is Carpenter. I'm looking for a room.
- Oh, I see.
- Are you an FBI man?
No, I'm afraid not.
I'll bet he is, Mom.
He's looking for the spaceman.
We've all been hearing too much about spacemen.
- This is Mrs Benson, Mr Carpenter.
- How do you do?
And little Bobby.
- Mr and Mrs Barley. And Mr Krull.
- How do you do?
And I'm Mrs Crockett.
I have a very nice room on the second floor.
It gets the sun all day long.
Can I help you look for the spaceman?
I know what he looks like.
He's got a big square head with three great big eyes.
That's enough, Bobby.
It's late. Excuse me.
We mustn't annoy Mr Carpenter, or he won't want to stay here.
He's really a dear little boy, and quiet as a mouse.
- You're a long way from home, aren't you?
- How did you know?
Oh. I can tell a New England accent a mile away.
(radio) Now we take you to Miami Beach,
Florida, for a report from Gabriel Heatter.
Mr Heatter?
(Heatter) And now on this Sunday morning we asks some questions that have been haunting the entire nation for two whole days.
This creature: where is he?
What is he up to?
If he can build a spaceship that can fly to Earth, and a robot that can destroy our tanks and guns, what other terrors can he unleash at will?
Obviously, the monster must be found.
He must be tracked down like a wild animal.
He must be destroyed.
But where would such a creature hide?
Would he disappear into the north woods?
Would he crawl into the sewers of some great city?
Everybody agrees there is grave danger.
The question remains: what can we do to protect ourselves?
What measures can we take to neutralise this menace from another world?
Destroy it?
Of course, but how?
And if we do destroy it, what do we face in retaliation?
It's not a simple problem...
George, turn it off that radio,
I'm trying to concentrate.
Why doesn't the government do something?
What can they do?
They're only people, like us.
People, my foot!
They're Democrats.
It's enough to give you the shakes.
He's got that robot standing there, just waiting for orders to destroy us.
This spaceman, or whatever he is.
We automatically assume he's a menace.
- Maybe he isn't at all.
- Then what's he hiding for?
- Why doesn't he come out in the open?
- Like Heatter says, "What's he up to?"
- Maybe he's afraid.
- He's afraid!
Well, after all, he was shot the minute he landed here.
I was just wondering what I would do.
Perhaps before deciding on a course of action, you'd want to know more about the people, to orient yourself in a strange environment.
There's nothing strange about Washington, Mr Capenter.
A person from another planet may disagree.
If you want my opinion, he comes from right here on Earth.
And you know where I mean.
They wouldn't come in a spaceship.
They'd come in airplanes.
I wouldn't be too sure about that.
That fellow wants something, otherwise he wouldn't be here.
That right, Mr Carpenter?
I must be a little confused.
Oh, Mrs Benson,
Mr Stevens is here to see you.
Oh, thank you.
Excuse me.
George, finish your coffee.
I promised the Carsons I'd be there at 11.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
We're all set. I picked up some sandwiches,
I put gas in the car and the radio's still on the blink, so we can forget about the spaceman for a day.
There's one thing.
I haven't anyone to stay with Bobby.
- I don't suppose we could take him with us?
- Well... Well, we could.
There's always someone here, but today they've all got plans.
I haven't any plans.
I'd be happy to spend the day with him, if you'd let me.
Say, that would be great.
Wouldn't it?
It's awfully nice of you to suggest it.
Sorry. Mr Carpenter, this is Tom Stevens.
How do you do, Mr Carpenter?
Hello.
Bobby and I had a fine time yesterday afternoon.
We talked and listened to the radio.
I thought today he might like to show me around the city.
- Well...
- Suppose I ask Bobby how he feels about it?
Fine.
- You think it's all right?
- Sure.
That's my father.
He was killed at Anzio.
Did all those people die in wars?
Most of 'em. Didn't you ever hear of the Arlington Cemetery?
No, I'm afraid not.
You don't seem to know much of anything.
Well, I'll tell you, Bobby,
I've been away a long time. Very far away.
Is it different where you've been?
Don't they have places like this?
They have cemeteries, but not like this one.
You see, they don't have any wars.
Gee, that's a good idea.
- What would you like to do?
- Go to the movies.
- All right.
- No fooling?
No fooling.
Bobby, tell me, do you have to have money to go there?
- I've got two dollars. Mom gave it to me.
- No. I want to take you to the movie.
Do you think they'd accept these?
Gee, they look like diamonds!
In some places, those are what people use for money.
They're easier to carry and don't wear out.
I'll bet they're worth a million dollars.
Would you give me your
$2 for two of these?
Well...
Sure.
OK.
Let's not say anything to Mom about this, though.
- Why not, Bobby?
- She doesn't like me to steal from people.
Those are great words.
- He must have been a great man.
- Well, sure.
That's the kind of man
I'd like to talk to.
Bobby, who's the greatest man in America today?
I don't know. The spaceman, I guess.
No, I was speaking of earthmen.
I meant the greatest philosopher or greatest thinker.
You mean the smartest man in the world?
Yes, that would do nicely.
Professor Barnhardt, I guess.
He's the greatest scientist in the whole world.
- He lives here in Washington?
- Near where Mom works.
- Where's that?
- Department of Commerce. She's a secretary.
That man they call the secretary isn't at all.
My mom's a real secretary.
Mr Carpenter, now can we go see the spaceship?
If you like.
I'll bet that iron guy's strong and could knock down a whole building.
I shouldn't be at all surprised.
I'd like to get inside that ship, see how it works.
What do you think makes it go?
A highly developed form of atomic power, I should imagine.
I thought that was only for bombs.
No. No, it's for lots of other things, too.
Do you think it can go faster than the F-86?
Yes, I should think so.
- About 1,000 miles an hour?
- Maybe 4,000 miles an hour.
And outside the Earth's atmosphere, a good deal faster.
How could they make a landing?
There are several ways to reduce landing speed.
You see, the basic problem is to overcome the inertia...
Keep going, mister.
He was fallin' for it!
Thank you, Mrs Robinson. I'm sure we've all shared your fears during the past few days.
I see a gentleman here with his little boy.
What do you think of the spaceship, son?
It's the biggest spaceship I ever saw.
- And you, sir. Mind telling us your name?
- My name is Carpenter.
Would you care to say a few words, Mr Carpenter?
I suppose you're just as scared as the rest of us.
In a different way, perhaps.
I am fearful when I see people substituting fear for reason. In fact, I would...
Uh, thank you, Mr Carpenter.
Thank you very much.
I see another gentleman over here in the crowd...
Extra! Extra! Spaceman eludes police!
Army put in charge.
Read all about it!
Spaceman eludes police!
Extra! Extra!
Get your paper here.
Army put in charge.
Extra! Extra!
Read all about it!
You think they'll ever find him?
I don't know, Bobby.
I'm inclined to doubt it.
Mr Carpenter, what is inertia?
The property of matter by which it remains in uniform motion unless acted upon by external force.
Oh.
I'll bet that's just the way
Professor Barnhardt talks.
Bobby, I have an idea.
Let's go and see Professor Barnhardt and find out how he talks.
You're kidding!
- Wouldn't you like to meet him?
- Sure I would, but I bet you'd be scared.
Maybe we can scare him more than he can scare us.
I like you, Mr Carpenter.
You're a real screwball.
(newsboy) Extra! Extra!
Spaceman still at large.
Extra! Read all about it.
Get your paper here.
Maybe he isn't home.
Gee, I'll bet you this is where he works.
What's that stuff on the blackboard mean?
It's a problem in celestial mechanics.
I'll bet he's the only one that knows the answer.
He doesn't know the answer.
And he'll never get it that way.
We probably couldn't get to see him even if he was home.
Hey, where are you going?
If he's that difficult to see, perhaps we ought to leave a calling card.
Did he do it wrong?
He just needs a little help.
What are you doing in here?
How dare you write on that blackboard!
Do you realise the professor's worked on that problem for weeks?
He'll solve it in no time now.
- How did you get in? What do you want?
- To see Professor Barnhardt.
Well, he's not here.
And he won't be back till this evening.
I think you'd better leave now.
Would you give this to the professor?
I think he'll want to talk to me.
I wouldn't erase that.
The professor needs it very badly.
- Mr Carpenter come home yet?
- Yeah, he's inside.
- Tell him I'd like to see him.
- OK. Come on in.
- Your name Carpenter?
- Yes.
- Professor Barnhardt been looking for me?
- I've been looking for you all afternoon.
Thank you.
- It was a wonderful day.
- You still haven't answered my question.
You know how I feel, Tom, but I just want to think it over.
Boss goes to Chicago tomorrow.
If I could tell him I was getting marryed and had dependants...
You're a good salesman, but I've got to think about it.
A good insurance salesman wouldn't give you time to think about it.
- Good night.
- Night.
- Hiya, Mom.
- Hello, darling.
- Good evening, Mr Carpenter.
- Good evening.
- Uh, Mrs Benson, this is Mr Brady.
- How do you do?
Mr Brady's a government agent!
- Have a nice day, dear?
- We had a swell time, didn't we?
Yes.
We went to the movies and had ice-cream cones, and then we went to see Daddy.
- I don't know how to thank you.
- I enjoyed every minute of it.
We better get going, Mr Carpenter.
Aw, gee, you didn't finish your story.
I'll finish it tomorrow.
Good night, Bobby.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Come on, dear.
Time to go to bed.
Why did Mr Carpenter have to go with Mr Brady?
I don't know.
Maybe it was a mistake.
Oh.
We sure had fun today.
We saw the spaceship and we went to see Professor Barnhardt.
- Professor Barnhardt?
- Yeah, sure.
- Mom, do I have to go to school tomorrow?
- Yes, of course, dear.
Gee. I was hoping I could go out with Mr Carpenter again.
Oh, come in.
The professor's in his study.
Thank you.
This is the man you wanted to see, Professor.
- Thank you, Captain.
- I'll wait outside.
- You wrote this?
- It was a clumsy way to introduce myself.
But I understand you're a difficult man to see.
I thought you'd have the solution by now.
Not yet. That's why
I wanted to see you.
All you have to do now is to substitute this expression at this point.
That will reproduce the first-order term.
But what about the effect of the other terms?
Almost negligible. With variation of parameters, this is the answer.
How can you be so sure?
Have you tested this theory?
I find it works well enough to get me from one planet to another.
I am Klaatu.
I spent two days at your
Walter Reed Hospital, room 309.
My doctor's name was Major White.
If you're not interested or if you intend to turn me over to your army, we needn't waste any more time.
You may go now, Captain.
Please thank General Cutler, and tell him... tell him that I know this gentleman.
You have faith.
It isn't faith that makes good science,
Mr Klaatu. It's curiosity.
Sit down, please.
There are several thousand questions
I'd like to ask you.
- I'd like to explain something of my mission.
- That was my first question.
We know from observation that your planet has discovered a rudimentary atomic energy.
- And that you're experimenting with rockets.
- Yes, that is true.
While you were limited to fighting among yourselves with primitive tanks and aircraft, we were unconcerned.
But soon one of your nations will apply atomic energy to spaceships.
That will create a threat to the peace and security of other planets.
That, of course, we cannot tolerate.
What exactly is the nature of your mission, Mr Klaatu?
I came here to warn you that by threatening danger, your planet faces danger, very grave danger.
I'm prepared, however, to offer a solution.
Would you care to be more specific?
What I have to say must be said to all concerned.
It is too important to be entrusted to any individual.
I gather that your efforts on the official level were not successful.
I come to you as a last resort, and I confess my patience is wearing thin.
Must I take drastic action in order to get a hearing?
What... what sort of action do you mean?
Violent action, since that seems to be the only thing your people understand.
Levelling New York City perhaps, or sinking the Rock of Gibraltar.
Would you meet with the group of scientists I'm calling together?
You could explain your mission to them and they, in turn, could present it to their various peoples.
That's why I came to see you.
It is not enough to have men of science.
We scientists are too often ignored or misunderstood.
We must get leaders from every field - the finest minds in the world.
I leave that in your hands.
One thing, Mr Klaatu.
Suppose this group should reject your proposals. What is the alternative?
I'm afraid there is no alternative.
In such a case, the planet Earth would have to be... eliminated.
Such power exists?
I assure you, such power exists.
The people who come to the meeting must be made to realise this.
They must understand what is at stake.
- You mentioned a demonstration of force.
- Yes.
- Would one be possible before the meeting?
- Yes, of course.
Something to dramatise for them and their people the seriousness of the situation.
- Something to affect the entire planet.
- That can easily be arranged.
I wouldn't want you to harm anybody or destroy anything.
Leave it to me.
I'll think of something.
Maybe a little demonstration.
Something dramatic, but not destructive.
That's quite an interesting problem.
Would the day after tomorrow be all right, say about noon?
(radio) There are no further developments, but police and the FBI are tracing every possible clue and rounding up all suspects...
- Rummy!
- Oh, my.
Did it again!
- Take a hand, Mr Carpenter?
- Take a...? Oh.
No, thanks.
We don't... No, thanks.
- Are you going out, dear?
- Yes. Tom's picking me up.
Personally, I wouldn't go out after dark these days.
But then I'm not courting, am I?
Oh!
Oh, Mr Carpenter.
Everyone seems so...
"Jittery" is the word.
Bobby's the only person I know who isn't... jittery.
He has his homework to keep him occupied.
- He's a fine boy, Mrs Benson.
- Naturally, I think so.
Warm, friendly, intelligent.
Mr Carpenter...
This is none of my business, but why did that man come here last night?
They just wanted to ask me a few questions.
Bobby and I tried to see Professor Barnhardt in the afternoon. He wasn't in.
Apparently they thought
I was looking for secrets of some kind.
Excuse me.
- Hello.
- Hello. Are you ready?
- In a minute.
- The picture starts at 8:50.
- I was with Mr Carpenter.
- I hope he won't think I'm intruding.
- Sh!
- What...
Good evening. Excuse me,
I was just going up to my room.
- Good night, Mr Carpenter.
- Have a good time, both of you.
(both) Thank you.
Why don't you wait in here while
I get my things? Tom, that was awful.
- I'm just tired of hearing about Mr Carpenter.
- Tom!
I don't like how he's attached himself to you and Bobby.
After all, what do you know about him?
I'll go get my things.
All you have to remember is first find the common denominator, and then divide.
Thanks, Mr Carpenter.
- I'll say good night again.
- Mr Carpenter...
I...
- Good night.
- Good night, Mrs Benson.
- Bed now. You can finish that in the morning.
- OK.
Bobby.
I think it would be better if we didn't see quite so much of Mr Carpenter.
Gee, why, Mom? He's my best friend, and he's awful good in arithmetic.
He even helps Professor Barnhardt.
Did you really go to see Professor Barnhardt?
Sure we did. He wasn't there, but we went to see him.
And Mr Carpenter showed him how to do his arithmetic.
Mom, is something wrong with Mr Carpenter?
- What do you mean, dear?
- On account of last night.
You think he's a bank robber, or a gangster maybe?
No, dear, of course not.
He's a very nice man.
I just think that he might prefer to be left alone, that's all.
Now you go to bed and forget about it.
- Good night, darling.
- Good night.
Mom?
Why would he wanna be left alone?
Don't forget to brush your teeth.
- Bobby, have you a flashlight?
- Yeah.
- It's a real Boy Scout one.
- Fine.
- Here. All you gotta do is push up on it.
- Oh.
- What do you need it for?
- I've, uh... The light in my room went out.
Oh.
I must tell you sometime about a kind of train that doesn't need any tracks.
- Really?
- Really.
- Remind me in the morning to tell you.
- OK.
No tracks.
Gort! Baringa!
(Mrs Benson) Come in for a minute.
- Bobby, what are you doing up?
- I couldn't sleep. I had to tell you.
- Tell me what?
- After you left, I followed Mr Carpenter, and where do you think he went?
Right into the spaceship!
- Now, Bobby, wait a minute.
- Honest, Mom. I saw him.
It opened up and he walked in.
That big iron fella was walking around, too.
- Bobby, you've been dreaming again.
- No, I haven't, Mom.
Honest. I promise you, I saw him!
- Where'd you see all this?
- On the lawn down at the Mall.
- In that place with the soldiers out in front.
- Where were the soldiers?
That big iron guy grabbed 'em and knocked 'em out.
I like Mr Carpenter, Mom, but I'm kinda scared.
Don't be frightened.
It was only a bad dream.
Here, we'll prove it to you.
- Tom, ask Mr Carpenter to come down.
- Sure.
- He's in the room next to mine.
- OK.
Think back. You didn't follow Mr Carpenter at all, did you?
You haven't even been outside.
- Yes, I have!
- You didn't really see a spaceship,
- but you thought you did.
- I'd never call you a liar.
He's not there, but look what I found in his room.
- Is it real?
- It looks real to me.
Mr Carpenter's got lots of diamonds.
He gave me a couple of 'em.
- He gave these to you?
- Well, not exactly.
I gave him two dollars.
This doesn't make sense.
I think he's a crook.
I never did trust him.
Gee, you think he's a diamond smuggler?
- You're going to bed now.
- I wonder if we...
Bobby and I have had enough excitement for tonight.
- Do you think it's all right to stay here?
- I've got a good lock on my door.
Bobby's gonna sleep in my room tonight.
Come on now, up to bed with you.
Bobby, your shoes are soaking!
Yeah. The grass was kinda wet.
- I'm going now, Helen.
- All right.
- Hello.
- May I see you for a minute?
- Well, I'm just going to lunch.
- May I walk out with you?
- Well...
- (phone rings)
Mrs Benson speaking.
Oh, hello.
I'm getting an appraisal on that diamond.
Can we lunch together?
Can I talk to you later?
Oh, that'll be fine. Bye.
I saw Bobby this morning before he went to school.
- Yes?
- I'd like to know what he told you last night.
I really didn't pay much attention.
Bobby has such an active imagination.
Did you believe what he told you?
I have a reason for asking this.
A very important reason.
There's another elevator we can use.
- What is it you want?
- Before I ask you to be honest with me, perhaps I should be completely honest with you.
- What happened?
- What time is it?
Just 12:00.
We shall be here for a little while.
About 30 minutes.
- We can try pushing the other buttons.
- They won't work.
- Why not?
- You see, the electricity's been neutralised... all over the world.
Bobby was telling the truth, wasn't he?
Yes.
It's that spaceman.
That's what it is.
You should see it!
You should go out and see it for yourself!
Thanks.
I am enjoying it right here.
The city has stopped.
People are running around like ants.
What a brilliant idea.
I never would have thought of it.
The people who are coming to the meeting tonight, have they arrived?
Yes. I talked to them on the phone.
They're all very curious about the meeting.
Good. Did you speak to our friend Mr Carpenter?
He'll be there at 8:30.
Tell me, Hilda, does all this frighten you?
Does it make you feel insecure?
- Yes, sir. It certainly does.
- That's good, Hilda.
I'm glad.
As far as we can tell, power's been cut off everywhere, with a few exceptions.
And even these exceptions are remarkable... hospitals, planes in flight, that sort of thing.
I wish I could tell you more but, as you know, all communications are out - telephones, radio, cable, everything.
I can tell you the President is prepared to declare a state of national emergency.
- Eleanor, did you call the electrician?
- I tried, but the phone doesn't work either.
- Well, call the phone company.
- But the phone doesn't work!
- Is it worth anything?
- I have never seen such a stone in all my life.
- Will you tell me where it came from?
- That's what I want you to tell me.
But there are no diamonds like this anyplace in the world that I know of.
- Are you sure of that?
- Uh, would you like to sell it?
No. No, thanks.
- I'd give you a very good price.
- Thank you, no.
I've told you more than I told Barnhardt because, in a sense, my life is in your hands.
I thought if you knew the facts, you'd see the importance of the meeting tonight.
Of course. Of course I do.
- You hold great hope for this meeting.
- I can see no other hope for your planet.
If this meeting should fail, then I'm afraid there is no hope.
It must be 12:30.
Yes.
Just exactly.
- Where are you going now?
- The boarding house.
I'll be safe there for today.
I can watch Bobby.
He's the only other person who knows...
- No, wait. There's someone else.
- Who?
Tom. He was there last night when Bobby told me what he saw.
- Do you think he'd tell anyone?
- I think he'd talk to me first anyway, before...
Well, we can't take any chance.
I'll get in touch with him right away to make sure.
But I've got to talk to him. It's important.
When is he coming back?
I don't know, Mrs Benson.
He left before noon, before that awful electric business.
I'm scared to death, Mrs Benson. I...
No, he wouldn't tell me where he was going.
He said it was something personal.
Well, please ask him to call me the minute he gets in.
Thanks.
Before we discuss plans, I want a report from Colonel Ryder. What about the robot?
When it was discovered that the robot had moved,
I was directed by the Joint Chiefs to find a means of immobilising him.
We accomplished that this morning by encasing him in a block of KL93, a new plastic material stronger than steel.
- Isn't it possible he's broken out?
- No, sir. We just checked on that.
- He's locked up tight as a drum.
- All right. Now we concentrate on the man.
Up till now we've agreed upon the desirability of capturing this man alive.
We can no longer afford to be so particular.
We'll get him, alive if possible, but we must get him.
- Is that clear?
- (all) Yes, sir.
Honest, Mary,
I'm so scared I can't sit still.
I'd like to run someplace, but I don't know where to go. Bye now.
Margaret, call the Pentagon.
Find out who's in charge of this spaceman business.
- Whoever it is, I wanna talk to him.
- Mrs Benson called. She says it's important.
Get this other call first.
- Oh, Mrs Benson, he just walked in.
- Fine.
- Are you nervous, too?
- Yes, I am.
- Helen, come on in.
- I've been trying to get you all afternoon.
I have some terrific news about Mr Carpenter.
- What about him?
- He's the spaceman.
I had that diamond checked at three places.
Nobody's ever seen a stone like that.
After what Bobby told us, that's enough for me.
Why is it nobody knows about him?
Why hasn't he got money?
All right, Tom, it's true.
I know it's true.
- You... How do you know?
- Never mind about that.
- Promise you won't say a word to anybody.
- After what happened today?!
- You don't realise how important this is.
- Of course it's important.
- And we can do something about it.
- That's what I'm saying. We must do nothing.
- Believe me.
- He's a menace. It's our duty to turn him in.
But he isn't a menace.
He told me why he came here.
He told... He told you?
Oh, don't be silly, honey, just because you like the guy.
You realise what this'd mean to us?
- I'd be the biggest man in the country.
- Is that what you're thinking about?
- Somebody has to get rid of him.
- (phone)
I won't let you do it.
- Yes?
- This is important...
What's his name, Margaret?
General Cutler. Yes. Oh, all right, I'll hold on.
You mustn't. It isn't just you and Mr Carpenter.
The rest of the world is involved.
I don't care about the rest of the world.
You'll feel different when you see my picture in the papers.
- I feel different now.
- You wait. You're gonna marry a big hero.
- I'm not going to marry anybody.
- Helen, I... Hello, General Cutler?
No, I don't want to speak to his aide.
I want to speak to the general.
Tell him it's about the spaceman.
That's right.
That's where he's staying.
- Yes, of course I'm sure.
- Thank you, Mr Stevens.
I'll want to talk to you further, but I haven't time now.
Deploy all Zone Five units according to Plan B. Immediately!
- Hello, Mrs Benson.
- Hello, Sammy.
Attention, all units.
Attention, all units.
When deployed according to Plan Baker, maintain station and remain on radio alert until further orders.
I'm sure Barnhardt can hide me until the meeting.
- Where's the meeting going to be?
- At the ship.
Yeah, they got in a taxicab and went off down that street.
Thank you, son.
Attention, Zone Five.
Attention, Zone Five.
Yellow cab moving north on 14th Street from Harvard Street.
Man and woman in back seat.
Get licence number and report.
That's the one!
Right. Attention, Zone Five.
Licence number of target vehicle is H0012.
Hey.
Looks like something big's going on.
Attention Zone Five.
Attention Zone Five.
Report when target vehicle passes your position.
- It's only a few blocks to Barnhardt's.
- I'm worried about Gort.
I'm afraid of what he might do if anything should happen to me.
Gort? But he's a robot.
Without you, what could he do?
There's no limit to what he could do.
He could destroy the Earth.
If anything should happen to me, you must go to Gort.
You must say these words:
Klaatu barada nikto.
Please repeat that.
Klaatu... barada nikto.
You must remember those words.
(murmurs) Klaatu barada nikto.
Yellow cab, licence number H0012, heading west on 15th Street at Treasury Place.
The target vehicle is turning west into Massachusetts Avenue.
Yellow cab at
Columbia Road and Connecticut.
Repeat, Columbia Road and Connecticut.
Attention, all units, northwest area, Zone Five.
Block off all streets intersecting Connecticut
Avenue on a line from Wisconsin to the park.
All vehicles close in.
Let's go.
Say, what's going on here?
Drive...
Get that message to Gort... right away.
- Captain, hold these people back.
- Yes, sir.
See if they have a stretcher at the police station. Take him there.
Gort.
Klaatu barada nikto.
Klaatu barada nikto.
Yes, sir. Yes, we have the body here now, locked in a cell.
There's no question about it, General.
He's dead all right.
I understand.
I'll be right there, sir.
Bring in a squad of men.
Place a guard around that cell.
- Captain, don't let anyone in or out of here.
- Yes, sir.
Come along.
- Professor Barnhardt?
- Yes.
I'm very sorry, but I have to ask you to call off this meeting.
Call it off?
But I had permission from the army.
I know, sir, but the robot's on the loose, and it's not safe. You have to get your people out.
Hello.
I...
I thought you were...
I was.
You mean... he has the power of life and death?
No. That power is reserved to the Almighty Spirit.
This technique, in some cases, can restore life for a limited period.
But... how long?
You mean, how long will I live?
That, no one can tell.
Under the circumstances, the army people have asked us to leave.
And, since their concern is for our safety,
I can do nothing but suggest that we comply.
I am leaving soon, and you will forgive me if I speak bluntly.
The universe grows smaller every day, and the threat of aggression by any group anywhere can no longer be tolerated.
There must be security for all, or no one is secure.
This does not mean giving up any freedom, except the freedom to act irresponsibly.
Your ancestors knew this when they made laws to govern themselves, and hired policemen to enforce them.
We of the other planets have long accepted this principle.
We have an organisation for the mutual protection of all planets, and for the complete elimination of aggression.
The test of any such higher authority is, of course, the police force that supports it.
For our policemen, we created a race of robots.
Their function is to patrol the planets in spaceships like this one, and preserve the peace.
In matters of aggression we have given them absolute power over us.
This power cannot be revoked.
At the first sign of violence, they act automatically against the aggressor.
The penalty for provoking their action is too terrible to risk.
The result is, we live in peace, without arms or armies, secure in the knowledge that we are free from aggression and war, free to pursue more profitable enterprises.
We do not pretend to have achieved perfection, but we do have a system, and it works.
I came here to give you these facts.
It is no concern of ours how you run your own planet.
But if you threaten to extend your violence, this Earth of yours will be reduced to a burned-out cinder.
Your choice is simple.
Join us and live in peace, or pursue your present course and face obliteration.
We shall be waiting for your answer.
The decision rests with you.

Oh, dear, ...oh, dear.
- Good night, officer.
- Good night, sir.
Evening, dear.
Whoa, whoa.
Thank you.
He's so charming and elegant.
He has such wonderful taste.
Yes, he has, when it comes to models.
Now I shan't be seeing you again.
Of course you will.
Just because the statue is finished...
...that is not a reason why things shouldn't stay as they are.
But I shan't be posing for you anymore.
Surely we are past the stage where we need an excuse to meet.
We have but what about other people?
Have you...
Are you going to tell them about us?
Let's not think of other people, hm?
Let's think of ourselves.
Excuse me a moment.
Janine.
This is a surprise indeed.
- How are you, Georges?
- I'm fine.
And you look wonderful.
Thank you.
Oh, Georges, this is Dr Pierre Gerard.
- Georges Bonner.
- How do you do?
How do you do?
- Janine, it's getting late.
- Oh, no, we've plenty of time.
Pierre and I are on our way to the theatre.
I heard you had a reception here tonight so I asked him to bring me along first.
I'm glad you did.
I was just about to show a few friends my latest sculpture.
Please.
Georges.
This isn't my statue you're unveiling, is it?
No.
Did you ever start it?
No, I'm afraid
I left the sketches in Italy.
Shall we go?
I'm glad Mademoiselle Dubois brought you along, Doctor.
Oh, thank you. I've always wanted to see the inside of your place, Bonner.
- It has quite a reputation.
- A good one, I trust.
Very. Tell me, how many patients can you accommodate at one time?
Oh, not more than 15.
I have the house next to this one, which I use as the clinic.
There is room for more...
...but I find that the patients I get...
...require a great deal of individual attention.
- Difficult cases?
- Difficult people.
Their money gives them an overblown sense of their own importance.
- Yes, I've met them.
- Yes, I'm sure you have.
But now I think it really is time that we...
Excuse me.
- Well?
- No sign of him, sir.
I waited till all the passengers were gone.
He just wasn't there.
- What time is the next train?
- In about six hours, sir.
All right.
Make sure you meet it.
Yes, sir.
I am extremely sorry to have kept you waiting.
I would like to say at this stage...
...that any credit due for what you are about to see...
...should be laid at the feet of my charming young model.
An artist cannot form a thing of beauty...
...unless he has a thing of beauty from which to draw his inspiration.
And now there is nothing else for me to do...
...except to throw myself on your mercy.
- A most wonderful likeness.
- Yes, isn't it?
Oh, Dr Bonner.
But it's...
- It's...
- A very fine piece of work, Bonner.
- Thank you very much.
- It's extremely beautiful.
You wouldn't be interested in selling it, I suppose?
You can see I still have to cast it.
Anyway, sculpting is something I do for my own pleasure.
Having not yet reached the perfection I seek,
...I find it quite impossible to give up the completed work,
...so I'll keep it.
- Oh? Where?
- Oh, not here.
Somewhere I can go occasionally to look at it and...
...be reminded of my beautiful young model.
- Are you feeling all right?
- Yes, yes, of course.
It's just that I think we ought to go, Pierre.
- Would you mind getting my cloak?
- Yes, of course.
Erm... a remarkably fine sculptor,
Bonner, don't you think?
Yes, very fine.
I wanted to buy it but he wasn't interested.
Says he always keeps his stuff when he's finished.
- Really?
- Yes.
I wonder where...
Hello! What's this?
I thought there'd be something else here somewhere.
Mm, a torso. Oh, yes!
Oh, yes, a very beautiful woman she must have...
Terribly sorry.
Very clumsy of me.
Your cloak, Janine.
Thank you, Pierre.
You are leaving?
We are already late for the theatre.
I hope you have a very pleasant evening.
Yes? What is it, Roger?
It's half past six, sir.
Already? Are you sure?
- Yes, sir. I've checked with two clocks.
- My watch says ten past.
It must be slow, sir.
The time is definitely half past six.
I need a new watch.
I need absolute accuracy.
Good bye.
I am afraid I must ask you to leave now.
You all know that my main duty is the care of my patients.
Their needs must come before everything else.
I would like to thank you all for coming here...
...and...
...and I must apologise if I seem rude...
...by bringing this party to so...
...to so sudden a close.
Strange fellow, Bonner.
Did you know him well when you were in Italy?
- Why?
- Oh, I don't know.
It was just that he didn't seem too anxious to see you again.
Yes, it did seem that way, didn't it?
Well, apparently it doesn't worry you very much.
No.
No, it doesn't.
Oh, it was beautiful, Dr Bonner, but beautiful.
- Thank you very much.
- Good night.
If you change your mind about selling any of your stuff, do let me know.
Good night. It has been my pleasure,
I assure you.
What time is it?
- It's a quarter to seven, sir.
- Thank you.
Tell Roger, if he has any news for me when he gets back from meeting the train...
...he can come and wake me.
- Whatever the time is.
- Very good, sir.
- Good night.
- Good night, sir.
- I thought you had gone.
- I want to talk to you.
- Nobody knows I'm here.
- I'm sorry but you must go.
But I must talk to you, Georges.
Not now, later.
- I'm very busy.
- Not later, now.
I want to know what's going to happen to us, Georges.
Look, Margo, I'll talk to you tomorrow.
It's Janine Dubois, isn't it?
You're in love with her.
- Please leave.
- I'm not leaving.
If you think you can just forget me you're mistaken.
I won't let you.
You can't!
You know I love you.
You made me tell it to you time and time again.
You made me humiliate myself.
I'm not going to step aside so you can be with someone else.
Get out. Get out!
Your eyes.
What's the matter with your eyes?
All right, Georges.
We'll talk about it tomorrow.
Georges?
- I'm sorry.
- Too late.
Too late.
Margo.
I tried to make you go.
I tried...
...very hard.
Wait a moment.
Yes?
Hello, Georges.
I saw the statue last night.
Why did you lie to me?
Why didn't you want me to know that you'd started work on it?
Why did you start work on it?
I like to finish what I start.
Oh. Is that why you ran away from me in Italy?
Is that what you call finishing what you start?
My holiday was over.
I came back to work.
- So suddenly?
- Yes, so suddenly.
There was a case.
It was urgent.
I waited for you to come back to me.
I waited for you to write to me.
Then I realised that if I ever wanted to see you again...
...I had to be the one to make the first move.
Why? Why are you so afraid of loving me, Georges?
I watched you towards the end of the holiday in Italy...
...and you were like a man heading towards something...
...which he wanted to avoid.
I began to think that I'd won...
...and that you were going to admit to yourself that you really loved me.
Was I right?
All right, Janine.
I did fall in love with you in Italy.
This could not be so I left.
- Why couldn't it be?
- It just couldn't.
- But you knew how I felt about you?
- Yes, I knew.
And you still ran away from it.
I'm not going to give up so easily, Georges.
Oh, tell me you don't want me to give up.
No, I don't...
Oh, I knew I was right.
May I see your statue again?
Yes.
Yes, of course.
It's very lovely.
It's you who are lovely.
I only copied.
Is it finished?
Nearly.
Would you like to pose for me again?
When?
Now.
You still haven't accepted that we love each other.
Yes, I have.
But it doesn't make you happy.
That's because it doesn't alter things.
- What things?
- Oh, the... the impossibility of the situation.
Come in.
The gentleman's downstairs, sir.
Ludwig!
Oh, please excuse me, Janine.
I have been waiting so long for Ludwig to arrive.
You'll understand.
Ludwig!
Ludwig!
Let me... look at you.
Oh... it is so good to see you.
That's good. You look wonderful.
Just the same. I was worried.
- Worried?
- Because I am late.
I... I knew you... you wouldn't let me down.
You have found the ultimate answer.
Is that it?
Oh, we'll talk about that later, Ludwig.
- Aren't you forgetting something?
- Yes, of course, our little ceremony.
I haven't been too well.
It has affected my memory also, I think.
Ah, you have not forgotten how to live.
What is the point of what one is doing...
...if you don't enjoy life, what it offers?
What is the point, as you say?
The...
The usual toast.
- Ludwig, your hand.
- Oh, yes, my hand.
- Let me have a look at it.
- No, it's not necessary.
I had a stroke.
That is why I was not here sooner.
It has left me with this legacy.
- Why didn't you let me know?
- I was frightened to.
I hoped you would have found the answer by now.
- You have not found it, Georges?
- No.
No, I haven't found the answer.
The operation is still necessary.
I cannot do it.
- With your left hand.
- No.
We must find someone else.
- But that is not possible.
- Well, try.
We always knew if we didn't find the ultimate solution...
...there would have to be another surgeon someday.
- The stroke might have killed me.
- But it didn't.
Three weeks I have been waiting,
Ludwig.
Three weeks!
I have been taking this fluid every six hours now.
Six?
It is what keeps me alive.
So you see, you must operate.
You... you know what will happen if you don't.
Yes, I know. You will die.
You're old. You can see death staring you in the face.
But I can't... I'm not going to die.
Then you must find someone else...
...to do the operation.
But who?
Who can we get?
We need a young surgeon, that's all.
Just a surgeon.
We tell him just enough to satisfy him...
...and I'll be with him all the time he's doing the operation.
That's the best way, Georges.
For the first time I'll be with him to show him what to do.
Next time, if you still need the operation,
...I shan't be here.
I'll be dead.
Find someone else? Huh.
It's easy to say.
- There is so little time.
- You are a doctor.
You must have met other doctors, someone who will do it.
Mademoiselle Dubois is leaving, sir.
Janine.
I'm terribly sorry, Janine.
Let me introduce you to my oldest and dearest friend,
...Ludwig Weiss.
Ludwig, this is
Mademoiselle Janine Dubois.
It is delightful to meet you, my dear.
How do you do, Professor?
I'm sure that you have a lot to talk to the professor about...
...so I'll say goodbye.
- Goodbye, my dear.
- I'll see you at dinner.
Janine, why not bring
Gerard along this evening?
- Pierre?
- Yes.
Yes, tell him Professor Weiss of Vienna is here.
I'm sure he would love to meet him.
I thought we were going to be on our own tonight.
Ludwig is here only for a few days.
We'll have so much time together.
Oh, Georges, you don't know what it means to me...
...to see you again.
It means everything to me.
This Monsieur Pierre, is he a doctor?
Even better, a surgeon.
And... do you think he'll do it?
If he's convinced that you give the operation your blessing,
...then he'll do it.
Why should he be influenced by what I do?
Ludwig...
Ludwig, you're still the same.
You just cannot accept the fact that you are a great man.
One of the greatest in your own field.
There is no medical man in the world...
...who would miss the chance of meeting you,
...let alone work with you.
Half of what makes up this reputation belongs to you, more than half.
You and I know that.
No one else does.
Listen, Georges.
Why not tell them?
Publish our findings.
Please, Ludwig, allow me to decide when to publish.
Probably you are right.
You have invested more in this than I have.
Yes, indeed.
Nevertheless,
...I probably shan't be here to see the consequences.
I am tired, Georges.
As you said just now,
I can see death staring me in the face.
I'm sorry, Ludwig.
Believe me,
I didn't mean it that way.
Strange, getting old.
One suddenly has no future to look forward to...
...and is forced to look back and...
...survey the past.
Do you remember our original toast,
...the first time we knew we had succeeded?
Of course I do.
Say it.
- For humanity.
- That's right.
For humanity.
Not for me, not for you, Georges, but for all.
I know what it means.
Do you, Georges?
Sometimes I wonder a little.
You have changed so much since we have started.
That is hardly surprising.
I'm talking about our original ideas,
...bright, shining ideas,
...full of hope for a brave new world.
What happened to them?
Where did they get lost?
Why...
Why do you say they are lost?
I think they are.
The years have brought me an added insight...
...that enables me to see more clearly...
- ...the fact...
- Wait a minute, Ludwig.
You are forgetting something, aren't you?
I'm sorry, I don't understand.
- Do you still have that photograph?
- Photo... photograph?
- Our photograph.
- Ah, yes, of course.
- Give it to me.
- Mm...
Look at it, Ludwig.
And what do you see there?
I see the two of us.
- As we were at the beginning.
- Exactly.
So, remember,
...when you talk of this wisdom...
...and this insight that old age has brought to you,
...remember I too have this wisdom and this insight.
- How old are you?
Have another look.
Let it remind you,
...while you have the wisdom that comes with a life of 89 years,
...I have that...
...which comes with a life of...
Yes, sir, I know what you're saying is possible...
...but it's not proven.
Proven!
If we doctors waited until something is proven...
...before we moved,
...there'd be no patients left.
They'd all be dead.
Look, I have seen it done in three different ways,
...none of them completely effective.
- The first is to make an ingress through...
- Ludwig.
Just a moment, Georges.
An ingress through...
Ludwig, why not take Dr Gerard down to the study?
- It will be so much easier down there.
- Yes, of course.
Come on. Come on, Dr Gerard.
- You'll excuse us?
- Oh, of course they will.
Come on.
I'll get pencil and paper to show you what I am talking about.
You know, the incision must be made directly...
Pierre seems very interested in your Professor Weiss.
Yes, I told you he would gladly come...
...once you mentioned
Professor Weiss of Vienna.
He's a wonderful old man.
Have you known him long?
All my life.
We... used to work together.
Along time ago.
That makes you sound very old.
Janine, I can't tell you how much it means to me to have you back.
I missed you so much.
You needn't have. You know that.
Yes.
Yes, I knew.
Georges, you still haven't told me...
...why you tried to avoid falling in love with me.
You started telling me something this morning but you never finished it.
Because I had to go away.
Because I have to go away again.
Go away? Where?
Where is not important.
What matters is that I shall have to leave Paris very soon.
But you'll come back?
No.
Why?
I can't, that's all.
You can't just stand there and tell me you're going away and never coming back...
...without giving me an explanation.
My work makes it necessary.
Because you're a doctor?
Yes, partly.
I have to travel where no one has ever been before.
I want to lift the curtain of life and see what lies beyond.
To do this it is necessary for me to go away.
Is it necessary for you to go alone?
All right, you've convinced me but it's not something I'd care to try.
Ah, you lack the spirit of the pioneer, Dr Gerard.
Being a surgeon is a practical business.
It's necessary to make a living.
It doesn't leave much time for pioneering.
But if you had the opportunity of becoming one of the pioneers...
...by performing one simple operation,
...what would you say then, huh?
First I'd say that no operation is simple.
Then I'd want to know what this operation involved.
If it were impossible to explain it, if you were asked to leave it on trust?
Then I should have to say no.
Regardless of who was talking to you?
Professor Weiss, when we started this conversation...
...I was under the impression that we were speaking hypothetically.
Are we?
No.
We are not.
I see.
I suppose I should be annoyed at this verbal subterfuge.
I don't know why I'm not, really.
Look, suppose you tell me just exactly what it was you asked me here for.
See this?
My right hand.
The one I would have used if I were going to operate.
I came here for one single reason.
To save the life of Georges Bonner.
- What?
- Yes.
By performing an operation that only I know how to perform.
You see? I can't do it.
Therefore, I am asking you to take my place.
This operation, Dr Weiss,
...what exactly does it involve?
In spite of what you said, this one is really simple.
It involves the removal of the uter-parathyroid gland.
I thought you said this was to save Bonner's life.
I haven't finished.
To remove the gland and substitute an alternative.
An alternative? Why?
Is it necessary to know the reason just to perform an operation?
Physically, no, but morally, I think so.
Would you be prepared to leave the protection of your morals...
...in my hands?
I...
I'm not sure.
Look at it this way.
I am asking you to perform a very simple, straightforward operation...
...and I am guaranteeing to you...
...there can be no ill effects.
On the contrary,
...unless this operation is done,
...and very soon,
...Georges Bonner...
...will die.
I agree that the operation is simple.
I wouldn't exactly call it straightforward.
- It's never been done before.
- Actually, I've done it myself many times.
You've done it?
There are no moral or legal aspects involved.
I suppose not, as long as the patient is willing.
He is willing.
- You will be there yourself all the time?
- I will.
And will you lend your name to this?
Very well, I'll do it.
Good.
Now, come on.
I'll show you what's to be done.
Thank you.
This is Georges Bonner's laboratory,
...where we will do the operation.
Wouldn't it be better in a theatre next door to the clinic?
No, no, it's better here.
We don't want people to know the doctor is sick.
It's bad for the morale of the patients.
That's a fine piece of work, isn't it?
Oh, Georges, I love you so much.
And I love you.
I've tried not to.
I've tried very hard.
Is it so bad now you've given up the struggle?
I don't think I could have let you go.
I'm not going to let you, ever.
Georges,
Dr Gerard must go now.
Yes, coming, Ludwig.
It's late.
I think you'd better let
Gerard take you home.
Whatever you say, Georges.
It's been a very great honour to meet you.
My colleagues will be most impressed.
Please, Dr Gerard, I must ask you not to mention our meeting.
You see, I am old and tired.
If the medical fraternity knew I was here,
...they would request lectures, addressed meetings.
Oh, you understand of course.
As you wish.
I'm sorry about this, Bonner, but I have to go back to the hospital.
- Thank you for coming.
- Not at all.
- Will you see me home first, Pierre?
- Yes, of course.
- Dr Bonner, please.
- Yes?
I am Inspector Legris of the Sûreté.
I wonder if I could have a word with you.
Of course, Inspector. Come in.
Thank you.
- Evening, Mademoiselle, Messieurs.
- Evening.
- We were just on our way...
- I shan't belong.
Don't leave on my account.
Oh, we can wait a few more moments, can't we, Pierre?
- Come into the study, Inspector.
- Thank you.
- Sit down, please.
- Thank you.
What can I do for you, Inspector?
Just a couple of questions, sir.
Routine.
Relating to what?
Relating to the apparent disappearance of a young lady, one Margo Philippe.
Did you say Margo?
But that's impossible.
- You do know the young lady, then?
- Oh, yes. Yes, of course I do.
- When did you last see her?
- Yesterday.
I had a small reception here and she was the guest of honour.
You... you met her here, didn't you?
Oh, yes, the young lady you modelled.
Yes.
Did you see her leave?
I think so.
Why, yes. Yes, I'm sure I did.
What's happened to her, Inspector?
Well, we don't know, sir.
She has just disappeared.
It seems the last time she was seen was here at your reception.
But that's terrible.
What could have happened?
Quite a number of things could have happened, Mademoiselle,
...and it's up to me to find out the one that did.
This statue you did of her, could I see it?
- Why?
- I understand it's an excellent likeness.
As I have never seen the young lady...
...it would help me in my investigations if I knew what she looked like.
I...
I'm afraid, Inspector,
I no longer have the statue.
But I just...
Yes, Monsieur?
You were going to say?
Nothing, nothing at all.
It doesn't matter.
Perhaps you can tell me who does have it.
Nobody.
A stupid accident this morning.
It was broken.
I was touching up a section of the plinth...
...and I knocked the whole thing over.
I'm afraid it was smashed to pieces.
I see. Most unfortunate.
Well, thank you, Monsieur.
That will be all for the moment.
You will let me know if there's any news?
- I'll let you know.
- Thank you.
- Good night, Inspector.
- Good night, sir.
- And thank you.
- Not at all.
- What could have happened to her?
- You know the statue is in the laboratory?
- Yes. Yes, I do.
- He only wanted to look at it.
He would have wanted to take it away with him.
I know how the police mind works and, I'm afraid, I know myself.
It's probably very silly of me but...
...I simply cannot part with my sculptures.
I see your point.
Well, thank you for the dinner, Bonner.
Janine.
Good night, Professor.
- Good night, Gerard.
- Good night.
- Well?
- He'll do it.
Oh, good.
What happened to the girl?
When is he going to operate?
It is me, Ludwig, who is talking to you, not the policeman.
What happened to her?
What is the matter with you, Ludwig?
I will tell you what's the matter with me.
Ten years ago when I came to London to do the operation...
...a girl you modelled just disappeared and was never seen again.
Ten years before that...
...another of your models just disappeared.
Two could be a coincidence.
Three cannot.
What have you done to her?
You're very tired, Ludwig.
So am I. You should go to bed.
I'm not tired, I'm frightened.
Frightened for you,
...what you might have done.
Good night, Ludwig.
- When is he going to operate?
- Tomorrow morning.
I thought I told you to go to bed.
Are you going to take another dose of the fluid?
You'd better go to bed,
...unless you want to see what happens when the dose is overdue.
I have been examining the gland.
- What about it?
- You tell me.
What is the matter with it?
Oh, don't distress yourself.
It will do what is wanted of it.
- I am not referring to that.
- Then what are you referring to?
This gland is not like the others.
It was taken from a...
...from a living body.
- You're talking nonsense, Ludwig.
- Don't tell me nonsense.
I am not such a senile old fool that I have forgotten the difference between a revitalised and a living organ.
This gland has been taken from a living body.
All right, Ludwig.
As you say,
...it was taken from a living body.
But it was because of you that I had to do it.
Now it's my turn to say "nonsense".
You were due here three weeks ago.
As always, I had a uter-parathyroid ready.
As always, I had removed it and revitalised it, but...
...you didn't arrive.
I managed to keep that gland revitalised for four days.
Then another one.
Four separate glands
I've removed and revitalised,
...only to have them die, and still you didn't arrive.
I just...
I just couldn't get access...
...to any more cadavers.
No.
Oh, no, this...
This was the only answer.
The answer for whom?
For you?
Or for the poor man you have murdered?
But I'm sorry.
It was my fault, wasn't it?
You had to do it because of me.
No, Georges.
I can't see how this can be justified.
You would rather
I had not been able to get a gland at all.
You would rather this was the end.
Is that what you would have liked?
Yes.
It is.
Knowing how it would happen you still say that?
But I'm not afraid of death.
If I were,
I too could have remained young.
Do you remember how we talked about it and you tried to persuade me?
But what is death that it should be feared so much?
You don't know what you're saying.
Of course I know what I am saying.
Why should the death of the other man...
...be of less importance than your own death?
By what right can you decide a thing like this?
This is a thing that only God can decide.
Have you become God all of a sudden,
...to judge that you are more important than the other man?
Of course I'm more important.
He was nothing, nothing at all.
A nonentity.
He had just as much right to life as you have, more perhaps,
...because he didn't attempt to tamper with the progression of life.
While you are on this pedestal of moral indignation...
...you seem to have forgotten that you are as involved as I am.
No.
I do not forget.
That is perhaps because I am so sad.
I am sad for you too.
You have changed so much.
I'll tell you why I have changed.
It's being alone,
...so utterly alone,
...again and again.
Every few years having to sever all contacts, cut all traces.
Having to disappear and start a new life.
You knew this would be the case when you set out.
Knowing something and living with it are...
...are two very different things.
I often think I can't bear it any longer.
Georges?
We have come to a time where we must consider with great care...
...whether what we are doing should continue.
No, let me say what I have to.
No man can live alone all his life.
It's not natural.
It rebels against human nature.
But as long as you continue...
...you must remain alone.
No.
No, there is an answer.
Not to continue.
No, to continue.
But not to continue alone.
Georges, you're not being serious.
Of course I'm serious.
Do you think
I've never thought about it?
This must be the answer.
Georges.
What you are suggesting is monstrous.
But why?
Why is it monstrous to want to be with the person you love, always?
Mademoiselle Janine?
It is she you talk about?
Yes, Janine.
I will not hear of it...
...and I must ask you to promise me now...
...not to consider it again.
I cannot promise that.
Then you are truly alone now.
For I will have nothing more to do with it.
Ludwig.
No, Georges, you mustn't do it.
Don't be stupid, Ludwig.
Give me that key.
Give me that key.
It is past time already.
Yes, Georges, it's been many years past time.
Ludwig, that key, quickly.
All right, I promise.
Now, give me that key.
You're lying.
I can see it in your eyes.
You are lying to save yourself.
Give me that key!
Ludwig.
Look.
Please.
No.
It is better that it end here before further damage is done.
This must be the end.
No, you must...
You mustn't do it.
You fool! This...
- This is all I've got.
- Yes, I know.
And I know it will take you two years to make a fresh supply.
No, no.
No, don't.
Don't do it.
Dr Gerard, sir.
Oh.
- Good morning, Dr Gerard.
- Good morning.
Everything is ready, including the patient.
Where is Dr Weiss?
Oh, I'm afraid he had to leave late last night.
He received an urgent message from his home in Vienna.
He asked me to... to apologise on his behalf.
Monsieur Bonner.
Without Dr Weiss it is out of the question for me to perform this operation.
Last night you agreed.
The Doctor's reputation is such that under his patronage I agreed to do it,
...but if he is not here, it's... it's impossible.
You must or I shall die.
I recommend you to see another doctor.
Wait.
- I'll pay you well.
- That's of no consequence, Monsieur.
If you are in the critical condition that you say you are in,
...I advise you to go to a reputable hospital immediately.
It's possible that they may be able to do for you what I cannot do.
Good day.
Come in.
Inspector Legris to see you, sir.
Oh, yes. Show him in.
Good morning, sir.
- I hope you'll forgive this intrusion.
- Morning.
- Please sit down.
- Thank you.
- What can I do for you?
- This is a little difficult, sir.
Are you a particular friend of Monsieur Georges Bonner?
No, I'm not.
I only met him for the first time the day before yesterday.
Then there's not much you can tell me about him.
No.
When we met last night
I received the impression...
...that you wanted to say something.
Yes, that's quite correct, Inspector.
Remember that statue that he said was broken?
Well, he didn't break it.
It's in his laboratory.
That's strange.
I take it you haven't managed to find the girl yet.
No, sir, we haven't.
And you think Bonner knows something that will help you?
I don't know what to think.
The deeper I get into this case,
...the more complicated and unreasonable it becomes.
Unreasonable, Inspector?
How old would you say
Monsieur Bonner was?
- About 35.
- Yes, that's what I would have said.
Why do you ask that?
Look, sir,
...I need your help,
I don't mind admitting it.
- To find this girl?
- No, it goes deeper than that.
Far deeper.
I'm going to tell you something...
...and then perhaps you may be able to give me the help that I need.
Please do.
Ten years ago in London...
...a young woman disappeared,
...later presumed to have been murdered.
That's not very interesting, you'll say.
It happens all the time.
Well, exactly ten years before that...
...the same thing happened in San Francisco...
...and ten years before that, in Bern, Switzerland.
Three completely isolated cases.
Then, two years ago,
...the international files at the
Sûreté were being tabulated.
A fact was noticed that tied these three disappearances together...
...and pointed towards them all having been perpetrated by one man.
In each case...
...the girl in question had been posing for a statue prior to her disappearance.
In each case the sculptor was a doctor.
And in each case the doctor disappeared shortly after.
All this is carrying coincidence too far.
You see what I'm getting at, don't you, sir?
Yes.
I see what you're trying to get at.
But if Bonner is the man you suspect, sir,
- ...he'd be over 60 by now.
- Yes.
That's where the whole thing becomes unreasonable.
You said yourself that he was about 35, certainly not more than 38,
...and I agree with you.
I assume you haven't said anything to Bonner about this?
What's the point?
These statues of the women who disappeared,
- ...were they ever found?
- No.
That's another peculiarity.
The statues were seen by a small number of close friends of the sculptor...
...and remarkably fine pieces of work they were too by all account.
Then they were never seen again.
How can I help you, Inspector?
Well, as you've met Monsieur Bonner,
...I had hoped that you might be able to give me a lead.
I have checked his background thoroughly.
His movements seem all perfectly normal as far as I can trace back.
And then I reach a complete dead end.
How far back before you reach this dead end?
Ten years.
Look, I think I may be able to give you some sort of lead.
It may not mean anything but it's worth a try.
See what you can find out about Professor Ludwig Weiss.
- You've heard of him, of course?
- Weiss? Vaguely.
- He's a doctor, isn't he?
- He was one of the very greatest.
He was at Bonner's house last night.
You saw him there.
Try to find out if he was in London,
San Francisco and Bern...
...at the time that those girls disappeared.
You don't think Professor Weiss could have been responsible?
No, I don't, not directly.
But you will try?
Dr Gerard, I'll try anything.
Needless to say, you won't say a word about this to anyone, will you?
Naturally not, Inspector, if that is your wish.
Thank you.
I don't know your reasons for wanting me to do this, Monsieur Dumont,
...but whatever they are,
I must decline.
I'm sorry.
But you're not making sense, Pierre.
You come here with a story which you admit is mostly guesswork...
...and you expect me to believe it.
All I'm trying to do is to warn you against Georges Bonner.
I gathered that,
...but you still haven't explained why.
I can't give you all the details until I am sure of them myself.
But... the man's abnormal.
For heaven's sake, Pierre.
Try to talk sense.
Last night Professor Weiss asked me to perform an operation on Bonner.
I agreed, and today
Weiss isn't there anymore.
Well? What's so mysterious about that?
By itself, nothing, but added to other things that I have discovered...
Oh, not that idiotic story about those statues again.
I've never heard anyone talk such nonsense in all my life.
I admit it does sound far-fetched.
That is why I want you to wait...
...until I can get more information.
Spy on him.
That's what you mean, don't you?
You came to make an impression upon me with your story about Georges.
Well, you've done that.
But it was about you and not Georges that you made the impression.
You are jealous of him.
You're jealous of his work and about me.
Well, I love him.
And I'm going to marry him.
It's unusual, Monsieur Dumont.
You will grant me that.
So is the fee I am offering you.
Yes, that's true.
Very well, then. When is it to be?
I, er...
I think I could manage next Tuesday.
It is to be now, tonight, and at my place.
Very well, then.
I'll put my things together.
One needs many instruments for an operation.
What's this?
This is a scalpel, Monsieur Dumont.
You couldn't be expected to know what that is...
...but to us doctors it is the principal instrument,
...like a spade is to a farmer, you know.
And just about as filthy too.
Leave all this.
I have all the equipment you need.
You have? Very well.
I always have a small one before I operate.
My hand is not as steady as it was, you know.
Wait for me.
Oh... Oh, Janine.
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting.
I hope you don't mind my coming here like this.
No, of course not.
I was looking for you all afternoon.
- The clinic didn't know where you were.
- I have been busy.
Janine, there is something
I must tell you.
I...
Georges, are you ill?
No, no, of course not.
- Why?
- Oh, it's just that...
Pierre was here earlier this afternoon.
He said something about an operation.
He's got some fantastic story in his mind about you and Professor Weiss.
What sort of story?
Oh, it's too ridiculous for words.
Something to do with glands and statues.
I really didn't know what he was talking about.
Darling?
- Are you sure you're not ill?
- No, of course not.
I'm just tired.
Yes, just tired.
I was so worried about you this afternoon,
...thinking you were ill and not knowing where you were.
- Janine...
- Yes?
- Would you do something for me?
- Anything in the world.
Then come with me.
Georges, what a strange place.
- Is it yours?
- Yes.
There's my statue.
What's it doing here?
I'll...
I'll explain in a minute.
I love you.
But it's simply wonderful.
So many beautiful things.
- It must have taken years to do.
- Yes, yes, a long time.
Wait, I'll... I'll show you something.
This is the very first thing I ever did.
I was 12.
It's charming.
1798? Oh, Georges, you've got the wrong date on this.
If you modelled this when you were 12 then this date makes you... 104.
Georges?
Georges!
Yes, I heard what you said.
I don't believe it.
Whether you believe it or not is of no importance.
It is important that you do this operation.
My answer is the same as before, Bonner. No.
Wait a minute, Gerard.
Listen to me once more.
Then we'll see if you feel the same afterwards.
Weiss and I...
...were fellow students.
I was his senior by 15 years.
- His senior?
- Yes, his senior.
I met him when I returned to university for a refresher course on surgery.
Quite by accident we discovered...
...we were interested in the same line of research.
And then...
...finally we discovered the secret of immortal life.
But we had to prove what up till then had been only theory.
So...
I volunteered to be the first guinea pig.
Since I embarked on this experiment,
...I have never been ill,
...never had a blemish on my skin.
Sickness and disease have passed me by.
So you see,
...not only did we discover the secret of perpetual life,
...but of perpetual health as well.
Then why didn't you publish your findings?
We haven't published because to do so would bring disaster.
The balance of nature is such...
...that the population of the world is kept at a level...
...where the world can adequately provide food and living space for our people.
If it were suddenly made possible...
...for people to remain alive and healthy indefinitely...
...the whole structure of nature would collapse.
Within one generation...
...the population of the earth would be doubled, then quadrupled.
There would be famine on a scale never before dreamed of.
This is one reason we haven't published.
- One reason?
- Yes.
There is another.
Every ten years it is necessary to have the uter-parathyroid replaced.
In order to replace an organ you must first find a replacement.
With no one dying there would be no replacement.
You told me earlier on about a fluid that you have to take to keep alive.
Only in the latter stages of each ten-year cycle.
If, for any reason, the operation is delayed,
...it is possible to remain alive for four weeks...
...by taking this fluid.
Not desirable,
...for it has an unpredictable effect on the mental balance.
And you have none of this fluid left?
Enough to keep me alive for another six hours.
I shall become the inheritor of all my 104 years,
...of all the sickness I have never had,
...of every pain, blemish, disease,
...a lifetime of illness,
...in one moment.
That is why you must perform this operation.
I'm sorry, Bonner, but I still can't do it.
Why not? Tell me why not.
You are asking me to participate in an offence against nature.
You said so yourself.
An offence against God.
Nothing you can say will make me change my mind.
You're in love with Janine, aren't you?
Yes, I am.
You wouldn't like anything to happen to her?
What do you mean?
At this moment
Janine is somewhere only I know.
If you perform this operation and perform it successfully,
...I shall release her.
If you don't perform this operation,
...or if anything should happen to me while you are operating,
...Janine will not be seen by you or anyone else again.
You have two hours to verify the facts.
Then I shall expect you at my house.
Two hours.
Remember.
Here you are, dearie.
Drink it up.
Why? What's the hurry?
No hurry, no hurry at all.
But I'm a working girl, remember.
Time is money after all.
You'll get paid so stop nagging.
Cognac.
I'm sick of waiting here for you to fill your great fat stomach.
- I'm going.
- What are you doing? What about...
What, do you think I'm a girl who can be bought for money?
- I've never been so insulted.
- You said 50 francs.
It isn't safe for a respectable girl to be around on her own.
My escort's here now, anyway.
Mind the dustbins, dear.
Never mind, Roger.
You go to bed.
Yes, sir.
Good evening.
Everything is ready.
Please.
If I perform this operation you will release Janine immediately?
I give you my word.
It will be extremely unfortunate...
...if I don't survive this operation.
No!
No, no!
Drink this.
I am very grateful, Doctor.
You can show your gratitude best by taking me to Janine Dubois.
Of course.
You'll be strong enough to do that by the time I'm ready.
It means nothing to you that you saved me from an extremely horrible death?
Nothing.
Try getting up and moving around a little.
How does it feel?
I said, how does it feel?
- Did you see Bonner go out?
- No. I heard him, though.
- Have you any idea where he went?
- No, sir, I haven't.
Find Inspector
Legris and bring him here.
- Yes, sir.
- And hurry. It's desperately urgent.
- Where have you been?
- Later. Come on.
You said you wanted to be with me.
Always.
- Is that still true?
- Yes.
Yes.
Whatever it may mean?
Whatever it may mean, yes.
Janine,
...I'm going to tell you about myself.
It all started 70 years ago.
Those are Monsieur Bonner's private papers.
Never mind that.
You leave this to me.
Now, then, sir. What's the matter?
Bonner has abducted Janine Dubois.
He's hidden her.
Wait a minute, sir.
Please will you start at the beginning?
Earlier this evening
Bonner came to see me.
He asked me to perform an operation on him.
This has been my... existence.
Not life,
...existence.
Until I met you.
Now you're going to come with me, Janine.
But first you must become exactly as I am.
Think of it.
Never to grow old, always to stay as we are,
...as we are now, never to be ill.
To stay as beautiful as you are now.
- No.
- Always.
Through all time.
And this fluid affected his reason?
For the few moments before taking it he became without reason at all.
Homicidal, completely mad.
That's when he killed those three women.
- And at other times?
- At other times rational, sane,
...charming, intelligent.
Here's a carrier's receipt.
"Unspecified crate, 3x2x2, collect at this address,"
"...deliver to railway arches,
Gare Du Nord."
Today's date.
The statue.
It was here yesterday.
It's gone now.
We must try it.
It's the only clue we've got.
If what you say is correct...
...then he must be all right now that you've performed the operation.
I made the incision but I did not perform the operation.
It will be all right, I promise you.
- No, no!
- Janine!
No!
He didn't.
He didn't do the operation.
He didn't do the operation!
I am going to die.
I am going to die.
- Janine! She's in there.
- What?
Break that door down quickly.
Get out of here.
From the Earth to the Moon (1958)
The fantastic adventure began that night,
May 18, 1868, at an isolated area located at 97 degrees longitude west,
42 degrees 30 minutes latitude north, or a day's and night's journey from New York.
Welcome home, Victor.
Thank you, JV.
Good evening, Vernon.
Mr. Barbicane, sir.
Have all the guests arrived?
The entire membership, Victor.
Making them comfortable?
Oh, indeed.
They will dine on mountain trout, pheasant, then rack of lamb.
We are serving four wines, and of course, using the gold services.
Good.
Victory.
I never tire of coming back to it.
This is the only place in the world that I ever get lonely for.
All is waiting, Victor.
Excellent.
Midnight then.
Mr. Morgana, I'm so glad to see you.
The pleasure is mine, JV.
You know, whenever I see you,
I get the feeling that
Barbicane is up to no good.
Have you any idea what our friend has in mind this time?
Not the faintest.
Beyond the fact that it'll cost us a fortune.
Well, we shall soon find out.
Here he is.
Good evening, gentlemen.
Please be seated.
Permit me to welcome you to Victory, members of the International
Armament Club.
I thank you for setting aside the important work you all carry on and from the four corners of the Earth meeting with me here tonight.
It is my belief that we stand, this night, upon the threshold of a new era in the affairs of mankind, an era that will change the concept of the physical world.
For the first time, we are dealing with the secrets of the universe itself.
My dear Victor, if you have somehow got in league with the devil.
No.
I do not intend to share credit for my discovery with the devil.
Therefore, I shall get straight to the point.
With your permission, of course.
It has been but a short time since the end of the war between the states.
We, the members of the
International Armament Club, did not make that war.
We made only the weapons and ammunition with which it was fought.
And all of us, myself included, profited handsomely by making and selling the instruments of war.
Nothing wrong with that.
However...
Am I correct in stating that since the termination of that war, most of us have fallen upon evil and unprofitable days?
Here, here.
Which, uh, I dare say, is one of the reasons you have all responded so graciously to my invitation.
Not the only reason, Victor.
We had in mind the pleasant thought that your invitation might have something to do with the explosive you used against Nicholl.
I'm glad you brought that up, Morgana.
It proves that I am not the only selfish member of our club.
Gentlemen, gentlemen.
What I intend to propose will guarantee us all armament orders that will stagger our imagination.
Stagger our profits, as well.
Profits unimaginable.
What you now say strikes me as quite incredible.
I deal almost exclusively with the incredible.
Gentlemen, the reason I have asked you here tonight is because...
It is now possible for Power X...
Power X to be used in a projectile...
A projectile that can be fired from Washington...
And hit London.
A projectile that can be fired from Rome and hit Tokyo, fired from the smallest country in the world and explode over the capital of any nation which threatens us.
You are pulling our legs, of course, Barbicane.
But... if we could deliver such a missile, we would be rich beyond our wildest dreams.
Every government would have to have one, sold by one of us.
Exactly.
Every government would have to have one.
I admit that some of your ideas which sounded hair-brained you finally brought off.
But for the moment... what is Power X?
Power X.
Power X, you ask me what it is.
It's a process...
A process so deadly, so powerful, that placed into the wrong hands, it could mean the destruction of the whole world.
Look here, Victor.
If this power can destroy the Earth, how can it conceivably be tested on the Earth?
My dear Morgana, you have gone straight to the heart of the matter, as always.
You're right.
It cannot be tested on the Earth.
But it can be tested somewhere else.
I propose a completely neutral wasteland.
I intend to shoot a projectile to the Moon.
Now gentlemen, if you'll just seat yourselves comfortably on either side of the rotunda, please.
A projectile carrying within its warhead a sufficient reserve of Power X to produce an explosion on the surface of the Moon so powerful that it can be visible from any point on Earth.
It's 2 o'clock, gentlemen.
I think it's time we sleep on what we've seen.
I shall not consider this evening wasted...
If I have reduced somewhat your skepticism.
Skepticism we are bound to have, but, uh, curiosity, we also have.
I say, let us start this project tomorrow.
Many years ago, I learned the foolishness of discounting your ideas.
I paid rather dearly for that lesson.
I dare say I'm not the only one who had that unhappy experience.
How much money will it take?
Well, aside from your personal pledges for millions, more millions, and that may not be enough, we shall have to appeal to the whole world for money.
My personal fortune, everything I possess, is pledged to this enterprise.
Thank you, gentlemen.
Good night.
I wonder if there wasn't a gathering like this in 1492.
And if the experts at that time didn't have much to say in opinion of Columbus as we have of Barbicane now.
Very good.
We'll be ready to pour at midnight.
The castings were excellent, Mr. Hooker.
Absolutely first rate.
I was received yesterday by General Lee.
He said...
Mr. Nicholl!
Yes?
I'm Bancroft, editor of the syndicated press.
You, uh, wrote me a letter telling me of a challenge you sent to Victor Barbicane.
A challenge for a duel.
Ah, yes. You want to write a story about it?
Well, that's excellent.
I'll say whatever you like.
No, I didn't come for a story.
Uh... pardon my being so blunt, sir, but you are an honored figure in Virginia.
Not only Virginia, but the entire South.
I have to come to beg you for your own sake not to release that duel business to the press.
I challenged a man who's swindling widows and orphans the world over.
Oh no, my dear Bancroft, you're wrong.
That story must be published.
I must save the world from these fools and their folly.
I'm sorry, sir, I can't agree.
Publish this story,
Mr. Bancroft, I beg of you.
Then Barbicane will either have to fight me or admit publicly to cowardice.
And people don't contribute money to cowardice.
But the disgrace will lie on you?
Why do you want to carry this burden?
I made the hardest metal the world has ever seen right here in this plant.
But it wasn't hard enough to withstand the explosive force that Barbicane applied against it.
Now I don't mind being ruined by Victor Barbicane.
But to have carried the
Confederacy down with me, to have failed in my obligations to my country all because of one man named Victor Barbicane, oh, no. I must disgrace him or kill him before he destroys the world.
Do you really think there's any possibility of him bringing this moon business off?
I certainly do.
Victor Barbicane is one of the most brilliant men on the face of this planet and incontestably the most wicked.
Father, here's a telegram for you.
Oh, excuse me, this is my daughter, Miss Virginia.
My pleasure.
How do you do.
My vengeance is being deferred.
He's insolent.
Insolent.
Is that from Barbicane?
Yes.
There will be no duel.
Thank heavens. What a relief.
Good-bye, Mr. Nicholl.
Oh, Lord, deliver mine enemy unto me.
Arm me with the shining sword of thy great faith.
Give me strength, oh, Lord.
Give me the strength of lions and the guile of a serpent that I may destroy this wicked man and all his works and save thy blessed Earth.
The fraudulent claims of Victor Barbicane for his invention Power X which is supposed to be capable of destroying an entire city at a single blow, are dangerous and deceitful!
The mere rumor of such a fearsome explosive has already inspired morbid desires among certain powers of this wicked world.
Governments which formerly slew thousands on the field of battle can now look forward to the slaughter of millions, neigh, tens of millions!
And all this due to the insane greed of one man.
It has therefore become my life's mission to destroy this man and all his evil work.
To this end, I have forged, by secret process, a slab of metal armor stronger than any substance previously known upon his Earth.
And I now publicly offer to wager 100,000 that no projectile fired by Power X can penetrate my armor.
And I make this offer in the presence of one who is either the world's greatest deceiver or its most vicious apostle of mass murder, Mr. Victor Barbicane.
I accept.
Military attaches from all the great powers are present to observe the outcome of this amazing scientific news.
Victor Barbicane so far has refused all questions related to his Power X.
And in a nearby promontory,
Mr. Stuyvesant Nicholl is anchoring in place the armor which might revolutionize modern theories of warfare.
Mr. Barbicane asked me to make certain that you were satisfied in every respect with the placement, sir.
Yes, it's exactly the way I want it.
I'm not so sure that your Mr. Barbicane will like it this way, though.
Drop her, Doug!
Might knock down that cloth, all right, and even the scaffolding.
But that's all you're going to knock down.
Whatever happens now, Mr. Nicholl, it's been a privilege to work with you these past few days...
And to come to know you.
And you, Miss Virginia.
Thank you, Mr. Sharpe.
You're a good sport, anyway, aren't you?
But the explosive hasn't been made that can even dent that armor plate...
As you'll soon see for yourself.
Personal conflicts, almost fatal, between two brilliant intellects will be known in 20 minutes.
You got that?
Where to?
Over here.
That?
You call that a cannon?
You didn't specify that it had to be a large cannon, Mr. Nicholl.
Gentlemen, I'm afraid we're the victims of a practical joke.
I'm afraid my sense of humor is not large enough to afford a $100,000 joke, sir.
I estimate the wind at, uh... oh, 10 miles an hour south by southwest.
Final warning, Ben.
Final warning!
Clear the quarry!
Men and horses clear away!
Final warning!
To the bunkers, please!
To the bunkers, please!
Shall we proceed with this demonstration?
Proceed.
Well...
This brings us to the point of firing.
I must ask you all to repair to the bunkers.
Why this insistence on the bunkers?
Is there any reason why we should protect ourselves from the blast effect of that pop gun?
I take no further responsibility for your safety, but I do deplore your foolheartedness.
I am on my way to the bunker.
Ready, J.V.?
Yes.
Ben?
And you, sir?
Proceed.
The disk, it's gone!
May God forgive you.
What have you wrought?
We have power plants 1 and 2 up to schedule for the first time tonight.
Number 6 is still lagging.
I should like to see...
18 million cubic feet developed simultaneously.
Six plants operating at capacity equals zero.
Seven plants operating at capacity equal 100.
Don't talk to me about lags.
There's enough power concentrated in that little cube to obliterate
Manhattan Island.
When can you energize Power X?
I'll need a week, perhaps more.
You've got a week, no more.
Although we are honored here today by the presence of many important personages,
I wish to draw your attention not to our distinguished guests, but rather to yourselves.
And to the men who are building this great work...
I shall be eternally grateful.
Mr. Victor Barbicane?
Yes?
May I have a word with you, sir?
Of course, sir.
Ben.
Introduce the next speaker.
Mr. Morgana.
I have been instructed to inform you that the message contained in this envelope is confidential and of the most urgent importance.
I am to wait for your reply, sir.
I'm completely at your disposal, Major.
Thank you, sir.
Can you come now?
Of course.
Follow me.
Mr. President.
Mr. Victor Barbicane.
Thank you, Major.
That will be all.
I'm honored, Mr. President.
Mr. Barbicane, I am sorry to put you to this trouble.
But there is a matter I wish to speak about with you which is too urgent to await my return to Washington.
I quite understand, sir.
I know the tremendous work you're carrying on out there.
The world knows it, too.
Well, thank you, sir.
I like to believe that we of the 19th century are privileged to contribute to the greatest achievement in the history of man and proud...
That so many Americans are associated with the project.
Mr. Barbicane, that touches upon my reason for bringing you here.
Some of our friends, and some who are not so friendly, are concerned that the Americans are building a cannon which...
A cannon which may never reach the Moon.
I'm sorry, sir.
Other nations are concerned in what way?
Sit down, Mr. Barbicane.
Your demonstration of this explosive has caused a tempest...
In every war department in every country in the world.
You will look upon it as a new source of energy.
Nevertheless, every man in uniform must consider it a means of destruction.
Have you ever thought what might happen, Mr. Barbicane, if your cannon ball filled with the incredible explosive should be fired into the atmosphere.
For a variety of reasons, a shooting star crossing its path, some slight flaw in the casing of the shell, whatever.
If the cannonball should fall to Earth in London, Buenos Aires?
Sir...
In wartime,
I was proud to develop and manufacture the most efficient implements of war that I could.
Today we're not at war, the world isn't at war.
Am I to stop experimenting, discontinue research merely because my discoveries may have a military application?
Does the locomotive builder just stop building trains merely because they might carry troops?
Mr. Barbicane, the power of a cannon to escape the gravity of the Earth is not exactly the same.
Have you ever considered the possibility of failure?
The projectile won't fall back to Earth, that much is positive.
The only conceivable risk relates to whether or not it'll reach the Moon.
Mr. President...
The power I'm trying to demonstrate can make a paradise of this Earth.
Or a wilderness.
No matter how positive you are of your success, are you willing to involve your country in war?
What am I expected to do?
Fire your projectile if you wish!
Aim it at the Moon if it pleases you!
But no charge must be in that projectile.
No explosion when it hits!
Mr. President, if there's no explosion nobody will know whether
I've succeeded or failed.
I understand that.
I realize what a poor reward your country offers for the honor you have done them.
Nonetheless, I have no choice but to insist.
What about my colleagues?
There are hundreds of people, there are thousands who share my dream, who've sent money.
Mr. Barbicane, when I asked you to come here,
I asked it so that you could hear from me personally what no other man outside of my cabinet has ever been told.
22 nations have stated categorically that they consider the development of this engine of yours potentially an act of war.
A few have made it clear that they believe that this government is actually sponsoring you secretly, that no one intends to shoot to the Moon, that we intend to rule the world.
I know the added difficulty of what I am asking you.
But you may never reveal the reason for your decision.
Nothing that I have said must ever leave this room.
That is the reason some precautions were taken in bringing you here.
No one must ever know that...
You have even seen me.
Have you ever asked a man to commit moral suicide before,
Mr. President?
You'll be hated, reviled.
You will be called worse things than a man can be called.
And only I will know.
Only I in posterity.
Can your government count on you, Mr. Barbicane?
Well, you've seen the papers, you know what they're calling me.
A swindler, a fraud, a thief.
I've sold the explosive and... kept the money.
I ruined tens of thousands of people.
I've corrupted the very name of science.
Do you believe it?
No. Do you?
No.
I thank you both for that one word more than I can say.
We anticipated every contingency except...
The stupidity of men and their fear.
Impossible, Barbicane.
If you have no consideration for us, in God's name, think of yourself!
Listen to that mob.
They're howling for your blood, Barbicane.
Maybe they have a better method of getting the truth out of you than we do.
Why don't you come down?
What are you afraid of?
Listen to them, Barbicane.
This is happening all over the world.
In London, Paris, St.
Petersburg, Berlin, Rome.
A bomb was thrown in the embassy in vienna.
The flag was torn from the consulate's staff in cologne and burned in the streets.
Don't show yourself, you fool.
They have guns out there.
Victor, they're right to call you a thief so long as you keep silent.
What are you going to tell them?
Nothing.
Victor... we are your colleagues.
If you care to give no explanation, well and good.
But you are compelled to share with us the secret of Power X.
We at least have that right.
Victor, I won't waste words.
How much do you want?
I'm prepared to offer a million.
And I am willing.
I'm a partner, too.
4 million, Victor.
Plus royalties...
For a little piece of paper.
$4 million.
You gentlemen will form a syndicate to exploit this energy?
Correct!
Everything's arranged.
The members of the Armament
Club have first refusal on the exclusive right to the use.
Well...
It's not for sale.
I'm not for sale.
No one on this Earth will ever know the secret of Power X.
Victor, Morgana has written...
Morgana. I wondered how long it would take him to turn against me.
Better than the rest.
It took him 32 days.
Balls of fire, to be so close.
We didn't intend to shoot to the Moon, JV.
Didn't you read the...
We've wasted three weeks and six days.
Miss Nicholl.
You have no earthly reason to be here, Mr. Barbicane.
Good day.
Is your father in?
He has nothing to say to you.
Haven't you done enough to ruin him?
If he is in, I intend to see him.
Whatever we have to talk about, let's talk about it now.
When can you start working with me, Nicholl?
You don't believe in preliminaries, do you?
We haven't time.
We've only 119 days...
To create a miracle.
Where'd you get this?
It's incredibly light.
It's from your armor plate that you set up at the testing field.
The explosion fused it and that's the result.
When I picked this up off the ground, the composition of your armor plate became quite clear to me.
Steel fused with glass.
And why are you so interested in this ceramic?
I'm going to the
Moon, Nicholl.
And... I'm coming back.
You're mad.
How many times have you been called mad?
And it never stopped you for an instant.
Yes.
I understand that you had all your plans and specifications some time ago.
To shoot a projectile to the Moon, yes.
But to return... and
I have no desire to spend eternity on that bleak landscape...
I must have a substance that will not burn up from friction when it reenters the
Earth's atmosphere.
Steel will melt.
Any metal devised by man.
Now...
This will get me there, Nicholl, but it will disintegrate into nothingness when it returns within a hundred miles of the Earth.
But...
With your fantastic glass... ceramic... call it what you wish,
I can survive the heat, the friction.
I can land on Earth and I can tell what I've discovered.
You've got it all worked out, haven't you?
With the exception of the glass skin for the projectile, yes.
I have it all worked out.
Once you have a source of infinite power...
And I have discovered the secret to that power.
You saw its effect.
A speck of it no larger than a grain of rice when the mountain disappeared.
You, Barbicane?
You have discovered the source of infinite energy?
Believe me.
The power of the universe.
I'll use it to explore the heavens, visit the Moon, make man's oldest dream a reality.
Will you help me?
I thought the project had been abandoned.
Thanks to your glass, it's been reactivated.
I'll expect you at the project at 6:00 Wednesday morning.
And, uh, what makes you so certain that I shall be there, Mr. Barbicane?
Because you're a scientist.
There's the whole universe waiting to be explored.
Wild horses couldn't keep you away.
Father, what was that man doing here?
What was that, my dear?
What did he want?
Oh, Barbicane?
He's planning a trip to the Moon.
But...
Barbicane's a fool.
Yes. And as a matter of fact, though he doesn't know it yet,
I'm planning to go with him.
The Lord moves in mysterious ways his wonders to perform.
Now, do your puddlers understand that once we start to pour...
We cannot stop until we are finished.
We cannot tolerate a single join. No flaw.
The entire barrel of the cannon.
Must be completely smooth.
They understand that.
You have my word for it.
Every preparation has been made, Victor.
Good.
You may give the signal to pour, Mr. Von Metz.
I make the trip 96 hours and 18 minutes rather than 96.
How about the return?
20 hours check out.
20 hours...
7 seconds.
Father, Ben's going to take me back to the hotel.
Are you going to stay here again tonight?
No, I shan't be back to the hotel at all.
Will you pack my bags in the morning?
Yes, of course.
I just can't quite believe it.
I guess I don't want to believe it.
You will when it's all over.
This is the beginning of something that man has dreamed about ever since he dropped out of the trees and started walking about on two legs.
Yes, or the end of it.
Ben, there's such an awful chance that none of you will ever get back or even be heard of again.
Well, a man runs that risk every day of his life.
He walks across the street or he starts to climb a stair and...
All of a sudden some silly accident has taken his life.
We run that same chance.
But it won't be a silly accident.
This is something worth trading your life for.
Men are always trading their lives for something.
Women are left behind with nothing but a few heroic speeches to live for.
Well, I didn't mean to make an heroic speech.
Actually, I want very much to come back.
More now than... when we began this project.
Much more.
Why?
Because I've met you.
And I'd like to think that... when we do come back, and if we do, of course, that I could look forward to...
Knowing you better.
Know me better now, Ben...
While there's still time.
You shouldn't have done that.
Why not?
I christen thee Columbiad.
You may clear the field, Mr. Cartier.
And prepare for takeoff.
Very good, sir.
They've fired the red rocket.
Thank you.
Where's Nicholl?
Three minutes.
Nicholl!
Mr. Nicholl!
Gentlemen...
I think you should be coming aboard.
You may lower us into the cannon, Mr. Cartier.
Thank you.
Good luck.
Thank you.
Lower away!
Hope I didn't alarm you.
I thought you already knew I was onboard.
Quite all right.
We're ready, gentlemen.
In less than 10 minutes, we shall know.
Either we shall be staring straight into the heart of the universe and all its secrets...
Or else we shall be dead.
Thank you, Nicholl, for all that you have done.
Perhaps those thanks should be reserved for later.
Thanks to you, Ben.
Now, start the gyroscope.
We'll go below to the acceleration tubes.
Our life preserver...
When they fire the cannon.
These acceleration tubes revolve at a speed of
12,000 times a minute.
You mean we have to get into them?
Well, certainly.
Otherwise, we'd disintegrate at the instant of takeoff.
Just as the gyroscope will compensate for gravity.
Exactly.
The tube fills with gas, then our hearts slow down to less than 5 beats a minute.
That's to minimize the shock.
Then 3 minutes and
15 seconds later, or 720 miles above the Earth, we will regain consciousness.
See this little black button?
Yes.
Just turn that, and the gas will be sucked from the tube immediately.
Well, that's all there is to it.
Open the hatch.
Come out.
And what happens if we forget to push the clear button?
Well, you have just 8 seconds to, uh, brood over that error.
After that, you'll be dead.
Well, it's time.
Time to enter.
After you, Nicholl.
There we go.
1...Zero!
We've done it, Ben.
We've done it.
What went wrong?
Nothing.
We're on our way to the Moon.
But there's no evidence of movement.
Something... it must have misfired.
We're still in the cannon.
Nonsense.
You're just befuddled by the gas.
Come on up to the astrodome.
Exactly as I thought.
We're still in the cannon.
Not a sign of life.
On the contrary...
We're now in the upper regions... of eternal night.
It's true.
May heaven forgive us, it's true.
Don't trouble yourself about heaven.
Just look at it and be content.
How does it feel, gentlemen, to behold a sight no human eyes have ever seen before?
Ben, start the log.
Take off as scheduled, sighted the Moon 9 minutes after the hour.
On course.
Nicholl, Ben, we shall share a bottle of wine.
Now, sit right here, Nicholl.
Thank you.
My favorite vintage.
I toast to death,
Mr. Barbicane.
And now I drink to it.
That's one adventure we can all be certain of.
Some sooner, some later.
I admire you greatly as a scientist, Nicholl, but your sense of humor leaves a great deal to be desired.
Very well.
To death.
The gyro.
Feel it!
Feel the weight of the finger of God?!
Cut the switch.
Two way turn!
It's returning to synchronization!
Nicholl, have you any confidence to impart to me?
Yes.
I made certain that your flight would never succeed.
Just before we took off, when we couldn't find you... why did you let us get this far?
Why did you let us get off the Earth?
I didn't think that you would get this far, Mr. Barbicane.
And if you did, I had to convince the world that your mysterious source of power was too dangerous to use.
How long did you allow us to live?
Perhaps 12 hours.
You'll see for yourself.
Maybe just a moment.
There's a gas leak somewhere below.
First get the masks.
Virginia!
Mr. Barbicane!
As I was saying, once again, Barbicane has proved himself a wizard.
A very clever wizard.
Gentlemen...
The initial hours of the flight are according to
Barbicane's prediction.
A new age has dawned for mankind.
Victor Barbicane is on his way to the Moon!
Father, I'm all right.
All right? You don't know what you've done.
Yes, but I do.
But why? Why?
It's fabulous, Father.
You and Mr. Barbicane, you're the greatest men in the world.
Father, may I tell you something?
Yes, you tell me something.
Well, I... I wanted to be with you because...
Well, I thought that you and
Ben, you'd never come back.
But now I see how silly and foolish it was because... this is no more dangerous than riding on a train together.
All right. I'll just get out now and walk home.
Well... why is everyone so serious?
Deduct the power flow from 1 to 6.
Look at that.
I see you knew exactly where to look.
I shouldn't have let
Von Metz describe our firing device in such detail.
Credit me with the ability to have discovered it for myself.
With Von Metz or without him,
I shall have done you in.
Can't we repair it, Victor?
We can try.
What does it all mean?
It means that... it means we shall all be simply blown into eternity.
Ms. Nicholl...
This ship is propelled by rockets, fired in sequence.
This central mechanism was a tiny target no larger than these.
This little piece of steel...
Will cost our lives.
Your father destroyed it.
Why did you do it? Why?
To save the world, my dear.
You self-righteous, contemptible... fool!
If you won't get some rest, at least drink this coffee.
Thank you.
It sure looks big, doesn't it?
You could almost touch it.
So near...
Yet so far away.
Unless we can create a miracle, this is the closest we'll ever get to it.
If you two have the time, supper's ready.
It's been 9 hours.
Oh, when we have the time.
Since it... has been 9 hours, should we be more hopeful?
Well, we're doing everything we can.
Frankly, I'm amazed that we're still alive.
But by all means, be hopeful.
Hope for the best and expect the worst.
That leaves no room for disappointment in either direction.
Anyway, the most important thing for you is to have a first-rate supper waiting for us.
Thank you.
You will remain in these quarters, Nicholl.
Come on, Ben.
Regardless of your determination for self-destruction, let me remind you that the food supplies and oxygen are below.
I shouldn't think you'd care to starve or smother.
Especially knowing that Ben and I are quite comfortable.
You know very well that our deaths would be meaningless while you live.
Well, take hope. There's a strong likelihood...
That you'll never finish that soup.
All right, Ben, hand it down.
Got it?
Got it.
If we time this properly, we may bypass the firing device altogether.
Fool Nicholl.
Gets you, Ben.
It does.
I'll give you some more slack.
Picking them up now.
All set?
All set.
Are you all right?
Nicholl.
To the left... 2 inches!
Are you hurt?
Turn it!
I must leave.
The man is the devil himself.
It wouldn't surprise me if he managed to repair the damage.
Why don't you say what you're thinking plainly?
That you despise me.
I could understand blowing up the rocket and everyone in it if you really felt you were saving the world, but...
Killing one man because you're jealous of him is nothing but murder.
Do you think that I would stoop to jealousy at a time like this?
I don't know what I think.
Well then, let me tell you.
I am beyond jealousy.
Just as I am beyond good and evil.
It will not be my hand that kills, it will be the avenging hand of God himself.
You accused Victor
Barbicane yourself.
I know, I know.
Oh, I wish this thing would blow up right now if it's meant to.
Making any progress?
Well, I diverted the power flow through the four systems.
The safety fusing still seems to be in good condition.
What do you think?
You know what I think.
That's a nice girl you've got, Ben.
Makes me wish we were accomplishing something here instead of... making motions.
Well...
Making motions is something.
Do things seem to be looking any more hopeful?
It took 10 seconds to knock those controls out of commission.
It took 14 weeks to set them.
We won't have that much time.
I... presume it's foolish of me to apologize for my father, Mr. Barbicane, but... I'm sure he felt he was doing something noble.
I'm sure he did.
Most mad men do.
Well...
If we're all going to die,
I think I should know at least as much about how it's going to happen as you do.
Will there be any warning at all?
Perhaps.
The reactor will probably melt.
Then the entire system will short.
For one instant, Virginia, the Columbiad will be the brightest star in the heavens.
Then it'll dissolve into pure energy.
You know...
If this hadn't have happened, we... we should probably all die in our beds old and forgotten.
But now, we shall die like a star, like a flare of light against the sky.
If one must die, that's the way, isn't it?
Virginia...
If we should come safely back to Earth...
If there should be future voyages to follow this one...
I shall always insist on having one woman among my passengers.
One woman... for courage.
Our automatic direction has been broken.
But our hull stood up under the shocks.
It's a pity that the world will never know what a truly wonderful ceramic
I discovered, Mr. Barbicane.
Speak up, man!
Gentlemen, the Columbiad is no longer visible.
Obscured by a meteor shower.
It's probably our location.
Other observatories could still pick them up, couldn't they?
I'm afraid the
Columbiad is finished.
I'm not accustomed to giving up without a fight, sir.
If you're through,
I'll take over myself.
Go on.
That was close, wasn't it?
Very. Only a few hundred miles.
Ben.
Mm-hmm?
If that moment that Mr. Barbicane mentioned should happen, will you do something for me?
Glad to. Name it.
Will you leave whatever you're doing and come to me?
I want your arms around me when it happens.
Will you come to the control room with me,
I've got something
I'd like you to read.
Certainly.
What are we waiting for?
Von Metz has told us the first meteor shower wiped them out.
Well, that's good enough for me.
The rest of them are still watching.
Yeah. I think there's a bigger story here than any of us realize.
What do you mean by that?
I don't think that anybody went up in that projectile.
We all know they went in.
Yes, sure. But they could have been gotten out somehow.
And bang, off she goes, and Barbicane is lost in a meteor shower.
Maybe he and Sharpe and
Nicholl are off somewhere counting all that money.
Right?
Yeah.
And nobody'll look for them because they've vanished in a meteor shower.
Nobody, that is, except myself.
I'm gonna do a lot of looking.
Now do you see the point, my friend?
I most certainly do.
Mr. Barbicane has been good enough to let me study his plans for the disposition of Power X.
Former plans.
They were predicated on our returning safely to the Earth.
But since your father has seen to it that we shall not return, the plans are meaningless.
The plans, as he chooses to call them, are nothing more than a scheme to make himself rich.
Oh, I'd have gotten rich, all right. Nothing wrong with that.
As a matter of fact, I rather like being rich.
No human being has the moral right to gamble with the future of mankind and make money out of it.
Oh, calm down, Nicholl.
Certainly you see the point in what I...
Really intend to do.
Very clearly.
Since I have unknowingly sacrificed your life, Virginia,
I think that you have every right to know the reason.
Mr. Barbicane's plans are simply a scheme to sell his secret explosive to every government on this Earth.
Had I not done what I felt compelled to do, the next war would have resulted in the destruction of the entire human race.
On the contrary...
With the whole world is possession of Power X, there would have been no next war.
The world cannot be trusted with such a force.
The human race isn't ready for it. Not for Power X.
It wouldn't have mattered whether they are ready for it or not.
It would have been there just as gravity is there.
Mankind's basic instinct to live would have compelled them to use Power X constructively.
In destroying us, Nicholl, you have not destroyed Power X.
You have merely suppressed it.
The secret lies in nature.
And somewhere, sometime, perhaps a hundred years from now, some other man will stumble across it just as I have done.
How many human beings do you think will be killed during the next hundred years?
Millions.
Millions.
And their deaths will be on your soul, every one of them...
On your miserable soul.
Why didn't you tell me?
Why didn't you tell me before...
Before you sabotaged us?
Because you didn't ask me.
Because I didn't think you capable of such... treachery.
However, let us not concern ourselves with circumstances over which we have no control.
Actually, uh... we should all be dead already.
What's happened to the Moon?
It's gone.
Mr. Barbicane!
What's that?
I believe...
It's the Earth.
It can't be.
You mean like a good many other things that have happened on this journey, it shouldn't be.
Nevertheless, it is.
Well, what does it mean?
I would give an informed guess that we are...
Slowly revolving in space.
My watch has stopped.
What time is it?
That's odd.
Mine's stopped, too.
Yours, Ben?
Hmm.
Our watches have stopped, too.
All at the same time.
Wait here.
Ben! Ben!
Help! Ben!
Secondary control behind me!
No!
Cut the power, Mr. Barbicane!
Stop the reactor!
And run wild through space?
What's the difference now?
Father, no!
Oh!
Well, at least I did one thing right.
Something very odd's happening here.
We're positively within the gravitational field of the Moon, yet we're not falling.
We're approaching it at an oblique angle, which may cause us to miss it altogether.
How can we miss it?
Gravity always pulls down and the Moon is below us.
Then we're orbiting.
Precisely.
Although we appear to be approaching the Moon, we are merely orbiting it.
Well.
Confound you, Nicholl.
If it weren't for you, we could disengage the compartments, use our rocket systems for landing.
What's the difference?
We could never get back to the Earth anyhow.
We'd have done it.
That's the important thing.
We'd have done it.
Whether anybody else knows it or not, we'd know.
Centrifugal force is thrusting us away from the Moon while the Moon's own gravity is holding us nearer.
If we can't break this balance, we shall orbit out here, until we disintegrate.
And without the use of our rocket system, without any means of slowing our speed, we shall soon begin to feel the heat, the terrible heat of friction.
Then the red glow.
Then... nothing.
Now check my thinking.
Our only hope now lies in breaking the present deadlock between centrifugal force and gravity.
Clearly, I understand.
And the only way to produce that is in this wiring.
If we can bypass the firing device...
The magnets will disengage.
And at that point, the rockets will fire.
Well, that'd put us right back where we started.
All the rockets would fire in a single blast and we'd be blown to dust.
We have so little time.
Yes.
It's strange how one hesitates to destroy one's own flesh and blood, even when there's no choice.
If the explosion were heavy enough, this disengagement might separate all four compartments rapidly enough to avoid complete disintegration, at which event, the main cabin would be the safest point on the projectile.
It's worth a try.
Virginia, what are you doing here?
I'm sorry, Father, but I had to hear.
We're all in it together.
Besides, I can be useful.
Remember, I helped Von Metz put this system together.
You take Virginia back to the cabin and see that she stays there.
I'm sorry, sir, but I think I should stay here.
Father!
I'm sorry, my dear, but since this young man won't take care of you, it appears that you will have to take care of him.
Give me a hand, Mr. Barbicane.
Very adroit of you, Nicholl.
You're not fair at all.
Oh, he'll be all right.
Good-bye, my dear.
Well... that ought to take care of those troublesome intellects.
Oh.
Don't touch it.
Well, if they think they can get away with this.
They already have.
We're locked in.
Oh.
Nothing shows.
Not a single new pulse.
I wonder how soon.
All we can do is wait.
Nothing like a good cigar to relax a man.
What could be humorous under the circumstances?
When these rockets blast, they'll make a flash that's big enough to be seen by half the observatories on the Earth.
Can't you...
Can't you just picture the stampede to buy those... useless cannons?
The reactor's the same.
Nothing's happening.
It will.
When we get there, Nicholl,
I'll plant one of these on the Moon.
It's beginning.
What does it mean?
It means that your father has succeeded, at least in the first step.
It shouldn't be long now before we find out how he did in the second.
A signal! A signal!
We have received a signal!
Tell us exactly what you saw.
It's a signal.
They've made the splash.
Barbicane has reached the Moon.
No, gentlemen.
No! A flash in the sky was not
Mr. Barbicane's signal.
What else could it be?
It's disaster.
This could be it.
Barbicane made it.
A signal from the observatory.
There's a follow-up.
What's this about Barbicane?
The observatory got his flash.
He's on the Moon.
Here's the follow-up.
The flash observed was not... repeat... not the signal arranged by
Barbicane and his associates.
Projectile is presumed to have exploded with loss of all aboard.
Ah, that's better.
He had to arrange that blow-up so nobody could check the story.
Victor Barbicane's the greatest swindler of the century.
That man is alive and we're going to say so.
Couldn't the Armament Club sue us for libel if we're wrong?
How can they prove he's dead with no body?
By the time this blows over, there won't be any club.
I don't want any more questions around here.
I want leads on
Victor Barbicane.
Virginia!
Is... is it over?
Yes.
I don't even remember.
That's one of the nice things about explosions.
Often you don't.
What about my father and Mr. Barbicane?!
They're gone.
The projectile split into four segments, each with its own secondary rocket system.
So... so the chances are it...
Oh, no!
Father!
Whether he found the Moon or death, he'd know how to deal with it.
So would Victor Barbicane.
There's only you and me.
I think... whatever happens, we'll know how to deal with it, too.
I wonder if we'll ever see the right side of the Moon again, the side we're used to.
I think we will.
We're passing out of its orbit now.
Then won't we be falling?
If I'm right, toward the Earth.
And this time we can use our secondary rocket system to slacken speed.
We just possibly could make it.
Look!
Barbicane's signal!
Then they're alive.
They're alive and on the Moon!
Alive and working!
How did they make the signal?
Barbicane had three Power X flares in the storeroom.
They used the landing rockets on the secondary system just as we will.
They have enough supplies to last them for days, at least.
And they guarantee you they're happier now than they ever dreamed of being.
And the whole world saw the signal.
No. That's the wrong side of the Moon, remember?
It's just passing out of view.
They knew the world wouldn't see it.
They meant it for us.
Yes, but someday, just as Mr. Barbicane said, someone will discover it all over again.
And then when they reach the Moon, they'll know the truth.
The reporters out there are getting ugly.
This hoax rumor's got through to them.
I've received telegraphic queries on that from New York.
Apparently, the morning newspapers there replied that nobody was aboard the Columbiad.
So I heard, but the devil of it is we'll never be able to prove it.
Of course, we will.
They haven't even been sighted since that meteor shower.
You begin to doubt, too, Mr. Von Metz?
Yes.
I think Victor Barbicane is no longer alive.
Do you?
I am certain he's alive.
The trouble with scientists is, Mr. Von Metz, that they only deal with facts.
Oh.
And what do you deal with,
Mr. Jules Verne?
Something much more real than facts.
Imagination, Mr. Von Metz.
Your goal, gentlemen, Antarctica.
Five million square miles of terra incognita,
But your job, to make it just a little less incognita,
Amundsen discovered the South Pole in 1911.
Wilkins explored the coast in 1928.
And Admiral Byrd flew over the South Pole in 1929 and once again in 1947.
Now, gentlemen, it's your turn.
As officers of this great enterprise, you will facilitate our navy's geographical and meteorological mapping operations.
You will also investigate the phenomenon encountered by the Byrd expedition of 1947, a polar oasis consisting of a body of warm water completely surrounded by this vast desert of ice.
Now, at the time, this discovery astounded the entire scientific world, caused a great deal of speculation.
Now, there are other phenomena that you will investigate.
Ellsworth discovered fossil remains of ferns and petrified logs.
Amundsen discovered veins of coal
100 miles long.
There have been reports of iron, copper and nickel.
Now, there may be deposits of uranium under these vast polar ice fields.
Now, in addition, you may find that...
Gentlemen, this way is south.
Thank you.
Now in just a few moments, we'll show you excerpts from a film made by the Byrd expedition which'll give you firsthand information on many of the problems which you are apt to encounter.
But first, we'll take a short break.
Not bad.
She's got a head on her shoulders, too.
Oh, you know her?
Margaret Hathaway, Oceanic Press.
How do you do, Miss Hathaway?
Hello, Captain. I'm sorry I'm late.
That's quite all right.
I was thinking perhaps the OP had decided not to send you after all.
Oh, no.
Of course you're aware of the dangers of this trip?
I am. I've read a great deal about Antarctica.
I wasn't thinking of Antarctica exactly.
I was thinking more of your being alone with 800 men.
I've read a great deal about men, too.
Don't forget, once I was alone with half a million of them for three months in Korea.
In that case, Miss Hathaway,
I think you've had excellent basic training.
Now, would you care to meet some of the men you'll be working with?
I always love to meet men, Captain.
Miss Margaret Hathaway, may I present Commander Roberts, with whom you'll be spending most of your time?
I've heard about you, Commander.
How do you do?
I can do better than that.
I'm an ardent reader of your column.
How do you do?
This is Lieutenant Jack Carmen.
He'll be your helicopter pilot.
Hello, Lieutenant.
Hi.
I hope you won't mind having to fly the first woman over Antarctica.
Ma'am, you just say the word, and I'll fly you up to the moon.
In a helicopter?
You won't have to worry about him,
Miss Hathaway.
I'm sure he'll cool off as soon as he hits sub-zero weather.
Pardon me.
The film's ready, sir.
Thank you.
You'll excuse me.
Will you join us?
Thank you.
So you're a geophysicist, Commander?
That's right.
But you don't look like a scientist to me.
You don't look like Walter Winchell.
Give me time.
CAPTAlN: Will you take your seats, please?
In 1947, the use of Huskies as draft animals was still very much a part of any operation in the Antarctic.
And here we see some scenes of the careful training that both men and dogs underwent in the months prior to embarkation.
Finally, the ships are loaded,
Admiral Byrd boards his flagship, and the expedition is on its way.
Its main goal is the Bay of Whales in the Ross Sea.
But 800 miles of the Ross lce Barrier had to be penetrated.
But finally, in the winter of '47, which is just the beginning of summer in the Antarctic, the expedition arrives.
It finds the first Little America intact.
And its foodstuffs, bread and other perishables remain unharmed in nature's great deep freeze.
Now, at the edge of the Ross lce Barrier some 800 miles away from Admiral Byrd's base camp, huge transport aircraft for the first time are launched from an aircraft carrier and land in Little America.
Now, their mission, the greatest aerial exploration and mapping program of Antarctica ever undertaken.
Now, here you see the first pictures ever made of Antarctica's ice-free warm water region, first discovered by the Byrd expedition in '47 and which will be thoroughly investigated by a member of our own group...
How soon do we leave?
...Commander Alan Roberts.
In two months.
December 15th, we leave from Norfolk.
CAPTAlN: He will lead an expedition into this region.
It's overwhelming.
This tremendous force chewing up the ice.
Diesel oil.
What?
I was saying, this overwhelming force is caused by the sudden expansion of compressed oil vapor.
Oh, Alan!
Oil vapors, molecules.
Do you have to be so technical?
A few things I can be quite romantic about.
Name one.
Well, women.
Oh.
For example, although I know basically women consist mostly of water, with a few pinches of salt, metals thrown in, you have a very unsaltlike and nonmetallic effect on me.
I give in.
Let's talk about diesel engines, shall we?
Sorry for the rough treatment.
We'll have to put up with it for a while.
We've just entered the Ross lce Pack.
Thanks.
The heaviest since Sir James Clark forced his way through it in 1841.
It's going to hold us back more than we anticipated.
We've got about 700 miles of the stuff to plow through.
It'll put us about two weeks behind schedule.
And how will that affect my program,
Captain Burnham?
Well, we've got four weeks of precious daylight.
I'll have to ask you to take longer flights than I would permit under ordinary circumstances.
You'll commence operations as soon as we reach open water, which will be just about there.
The weather reports are satisfactory.
The sooner you get going, the better.
Are you ready, Lieutenant?
I think so, sir.
Steve?
Ship's all checked out, sir.
Engine's heated.
Provisions? Survival kits?
Yes, sir.
Fine. How about you, Commander?
All my gear's aboard, sir.
Good.
Miss Hathaway, you understand that if anything should happen out there, your chances for survival are limited?
I'm going.
All right, then. Good luck.
Thank you.
Happy landings.
Thank you, sir.
Look at those two.
Man and wife?
Nope. Both males.
Wanna say hello to them?
Maybe you can get an interview.
Looks like they're all wearing tuxedos.
Nope. All female.
40 below zero.
It's hard to believe that millions of years ago this region was subtropical.
In those days, on an excursion like this, you would have worn a bathing suit.
Born too late, I always say.
Unless Mount Erebus erupts again.
If she did, there'd be a lot of melted snow down there.
The latest weather report, sir.
Contact Lieutenant Carmen.
The helicopter is to return at once.
Yes, sir.
A sudden shift in the wind.
There's a storm moving in between here and the warm water region.
I hope we can catch them before they land.
We're getting closer.
Right beyond this range.
There it is!
Well, now I believe it, but there's still the big question.
Is it the beginning of a new heat wave or the tail-end of a million-year-old cooling-off process?
Just how warm is this water?
Warm enough to swim in. 68 degrees.
Base to Helicopter X-3, Over,
Helicopter X-3 to base. Over.
Base to Helicopter X-3. There's a storm front developing south of bay.
Wind velocity 45, direction south-south east.
Return at once,
Try to skirt it in westerly direction,
Do not fly through it! Over,
Received your message.
Am returning to base. Out.
Bad weather building up.
We've got to get back to the base.
There she is.
How high can we go?
Not high enough.
Lieutenant, I've gotta get home.
I've got a kid that's gonna be born in June.
What's your hurry?
It's only the beginning of February.
Are you going to fly around it?
And then refill at the nearest gas station to get home? No, can't do.
Couldn't we just land here?
Look down.
Even if we could, it would be a nice three-week stroll back to base.
Why don't we go back to the warm water lakes and just sit it out?
Ever hear of the point of no return?
It's back there.
Now, what we need is to find a break in this weather.
Over there.
That's what I've been looking for.
It's taking a chance, but there's no other way.
Okay, hold on to your parkas.
I hope to get out of this before we're iced up.
What's your altitude?
Three thousand.
Our collective control is damaged.
The only way I can go is down!
Helicopter X-3 to base.
Helicopter X-3 to base.
The aerial's gone!
Hang on!
We should break through any second.
I don't get it.
We dropped below sea level.
Lieutenant, look at the temperature.
What is it?
We've just gone through a temperature rise of about 50 degrees in less than two minutes.
It's still going up.
What's your altitude?
Twelve hundred feet below sea level.
We could be inside the crater of a volcano.
I hope it's got a bottom.
What's the temperature now?
91 degrees.
It's so hard to breathe.
It's the humidity. Must be close to 100%.
We're now 2,500 feet below sea level!
And the temperature's still going up.
We're breaking through!
Look out!
Hang on! We're gonna hit!
Now, can you see where we got hit?
I can't see anything from here.
I'll take a look up top.
Do you know what's wrong?
No. Not yet.
Steve, while you're up there, see what the antenna damage is.
Lieutenant, I'm gonna need some tools up here.
It's the push-pull tube assembly.
How bad?
Well, I won't be able to tell you till I take it apart.
But it looks as though all it is is a bent tube.
Tools coming right up, Steve.
Oh, Commander, you better take a quick look around.
We're not gonna be here very long.
That's all right with me, Jack.
Why?
Where's that inquiring reporter's mind of yours?
Come on, let's take a look around.
Here we are practically at the South Pole.
A few minutes ago it was 60 below zero.
Wait here.
Alan! Alan!
Maggie, over here.
Where are you?
Right here.
See this?
It's volcanic activity, all right.
Somewhere beneath us, hot gases under tremendous pressure have found a channel to approach the surface.
We'd better get back to the ship.
This is Helicopter X-3 calling base.
We are down.
Helicopter X-3 is down.
Our location, between grid 30 and 32.
We're invisible from the air.
Can you home in on my signal?
Do you read me? Over.
You got the radio fixed?
I'm not so sure.
I haven't been able to pick up a thing.
What about your transmitter? Do you think you're getting through to them?
If I was, they'd answer me.
There's nothing wrong with my receiver.
It could be atmospheric conditions.
Yeah. I'll try again a little later on.
Lieutenant.
It's the push-pull rod, isn't it?
Yes, sir.
All we have to do is straighten it.
Lieutenant, I just realized, this tube is a magnesium alloy.
What are we gonna do now?
Well, in the first place, within the next few hours there won't be a square mile of this area that won't be covered by search planes.
What good'll that do?
They won't be able to see us.
They can pick up our radio signal and home in on it.
They can get us out of here in a few hours.
Right, Lieutenant?
Right.
Steve, help me get out the survival kit.
We might as well make ourselves comfortable.
Commander, you're an excellent naval officer and a brilliant scientist, but you're a very poor liar.
Commander, would you give me a hand here?
Excuse me.
Well, we won't starve for a while, anyway.
Enough rations in here to feed a small army for a couple of months.
If we're not found within 30 days, we'll have to do better than that.
The expedition pulls out at the end of February, and there may not be another one for years.
Can I be of any help?
Yes. You can carry this water jug.
It may have to last us for some time, so be careful.
Well, come on.
Hello, hello!
This is Helicopter X-3 calling base.
Mayday! Mayday!
This is Helicopter X-3 calling base.
We're down and lost.
Please come in. Please come in.
This is Helicopter X-3 calling base.
Mayday! Mayday!
This is Helicopter X-3 calling base!
Mayday! Mayday!
Well, what about that scream?
Didn't you hear it?
I heard it.
I heard something.
Rising volcanic heat melts the ice on top of those cliffs and turns it into the clouds that hang over this valley.
It keeps the heat and the moisture sealed in permanently.
Climatic change, one of the main causes of evolution, doesn't exist here.
See that tree?
It's a species that disappeared from the Earth millions of years ago.
What are you trying to tell us, Commander?
We're liable to meet some ape men around here?
Even the apes are millions of years in the future.
It's my guess that this valley is still in the Mesozoic era.
Do you think there's any kind of animal life down here?
Yes, I'm pretty sure that there is.
Tastes like rotten eggs.
Listen!
Hello, navy rescue.
Helicopter X-3 down. Helicopter X-3 is down.
Calling mayday! Calling mayday!
Get a fix on us please.
We can hear your engines.
You're very close to us.
I'll keep talking as long as I can.
You won't be able to bring a plane in here.
It'll take a copter.
We're at the bottom of a deep canyon, about 3,000 feet below sea level.
There's a heavy cloud layer, some 1,500 feet that you'll have to break through.
We have a broken push-pull tube assembly.
If you drop us a replacement, we can fly out.
We have enough gas to return to base.
Our physical condition is good.
We have enough food for six weeks.
Hello, navy rescue. This is Helicopter X-3.
My battery is running low.
Am forced to discontinue.
Will try to contact you when you return to this sector. Out.
They're right over us!
Why can't they hear us?
I don't think our signal is strong enough.
Can't understand it.
We had enough power last night.
What're you gonna do, Miller? Wait!
A flare's only good for 400 feet.
Why don't we save them until they can see it?
Whoops.
Sorry, Maggie.
I just felt so darned messy.
I had to clean up a bit.
Where's Steve?
Out looking for some fresh water.
I told him to stay close to camp.
Give me a hand with this, will you?
Maggie, will you please bring the oars?
What's the matter?
There's... There's something back there. Awful.
There.
First of the flying lizards.
What a smell.
We better get back to camp.
It isn't safe here.
What's on your mind?
A dead animal is food.
I don't want to be here to meet its consumers.
Come on.
Steve, you go fire up the engines!
Maggie, go with him.
Come on!
Come on!
More throttle!
That sound! What is it, Alan?
Whatever it was, rex wanted no part of it.
You mean there's something that thing's scared of?
The tyrannosaurus that attacked us is the largest, most ferocious dinosaur of this era.
It's not only its size, but the structure...
Alan, no lectures now, please.
Obviously, the only place we've got a chance is right here in this helicopter.
In that case, we better keep our food supplies in here, too.
Right.
Come on, Steve. Let's get them.
We'd better all help.
I don't suppose there's any point in asking which one of us did this.
Come on, Alan, you're the scientist.
What did it?
What could be worse than that thing that attacked us?
Just people, Maggie. Just plain folks.
There weren't any humans in this age.
Fog's beginning to roll in again.
I don't think we'll ever find a way up those cliffs.
Well, whatever it is, at least it's keeping rex away.
Twenty-five more days and after that we'll be the only humans in Antarctica.
That calendar of yours could be wrong.
Besides, they wouldn't think of leaving without us.
Maggie, we gotta face it, they can't risk 1,000 men just for the four of us.
And once winter sets in, the ice pack would crush their ships like matchboxes.
We've still got 25 days.
That's just about how long my clothes are going to last.
You know, I got a name for this valley.
Hell's Chimney.
Fog really socks in, doesn't it?
Oh, Steve, isn't he darling! What is it?
I don't know. I picked him off a tree.
Was sure good to find something small and soft, something that wasn't ready to kill you.
Well, how do you do?
Know him?
Sort of a nodding acquaintance.
I think he's a tarsier, or a very close relative.
He's a mammal, but it's his eyes that tell the story.
Observe, please, they're on the front of his head and not on the side like reptile or fish eyes.
Yes. This little fella already has stereoscopic vision.
MAGGlE:
He certainly looks silly.
Not a very nice way to talk about one of your ancestors.
One of my ancestors?
Mmm-hmm.
Homo sapiens junior. Very, very junior.
At this moment, he can't make up his mind whether or not he should become a real monkey.
But you will.
In 50 million years, you'll be a monkey in a tree.
And then one day, you'll come down and walk on your hind legs.
Another 50 million years flip by just "pfft," and you'll be Aristotle,
Galileo, Michelangelo, Mozart, Shakespeare.
What are we gonna be, monkeys?
I'm gonna get Shakespeare a drink.
Maggie!
Alan!
Maggie, where are you?
Maggie!
Any luck?
No, not a trace.
Commander, here's something.
It's part of her outfit.
I don't understand it.
No animal tracks here. No sign of a struggle.
Here's your answer, Alan.
Look at this!
These footprints were made by a being physically very much like us.
That's all I can tell you.
Except whatever it is, it's got Maggie.
How do you know?
Where's the footprints?
She was being carried.
End of the line.
He used a boat.
He's on this river somewhere.
There!
That smoke's coming from a cave!
Here. Drink.
You're one of us. Who are you?
How did I get here?
I brought you here.
Where are the others?
Where are the others?
That's our food, isn't it?
It's mine.
The whole valley's mine.
Everything in it belongs to me, including you.
What happened to the others?
They're dead.
You killed them.
One of the beasts did it for me.
How long have you been in this valley?
Ten years.
A hundred years.
Time has no meaning when you have nothing to wait for.
How have you managed to stay alive?
Not on charity or pity or the nobleness of the soul.
I survived because I'm the fittest to survive!
Because I've learned how to kill efficiently!
You must be very strong.
It's my intelligence that keeps me alive and in control of this land.
The big beasts are stupid.
They kill when they're hungry.
But I plan murder ahead.
Do you know how?
No. Tell me.
Their eggs!
I destroy their eggs.
Why, that's...
That's very clever.
And those that I permit to live,
I control with this.
The sound frightens them.
Then it was you who...
Yes. That's how I rule them.
No! Don't!
Stay away from her!
Move away, caveman!
Caveman!
You won't call me that after you've been here for 10 years.
You'll be crawling on your belly like the rest of the beasts, if you live that long.
You're out of your mind.
Don't say that!
Hold it, Jack.
I'm sorry.
I'm sure that he didn't mean to offend you.
The fact that you've been able to survive in this terrible place proves you're a man of superior intelligence.
My name is Roberts.
Margaret Hathaway,
Lieutenant Carmen and Mr. Miller.
Now, who are you?
We crashed.
Four of us.
The '45 expedition.
A plane disappeared with four men aboard.
Four men.
Three are dead, but... Who am l?
I'm Hunter.
Dr. Carl Hunter.
After what he's been through, it's no wonder he's like this.
This is your trouble, isn't it?
That's from our ship. How did you...
After we crashed,
I stored some of the wreckage.
I think you could replace this out of it.
I'll tell you where it is, then the three of you will go, and the woman stays here.
What? Oh, you're really crazy.
You don't seem to understand.
I'm giving you a way out of here, the only way out.
What if we don't go along with your proposition?
You will, and sooner than you think.
Do you see this?
In case you don't remember, it's a gun.
If I have to, I'm gonna blow a hole right through your head.
We'll find the wreck without your help.
Maybe you will, if you aren't trampled to death first or eaten alive or die of starvation.
Wait till the Antarctic night comes and for nine months the black air hangs round you like a rotten rag.
And your eyes are blinded from the dark and from your own sweat.
And you'll lose each other!
And you're alone!
Alone! Do you hear me?
Always alone.
Maggie, get out of here, quick. That way.
Hey!
Hey!
Hey! Hey!
Hey!
Maggie!
Maggie.
I backed into it.
It was horrible! Horrible!
It's all right now.
Where's Hunter? He was here.
Oh, we'll never get out of here, Alan!
Never, never, never!
Stop it! Do you hear me? Stop it!
This doesn't sound like you.
We're not licked yet.
Three lives for one, Alan.
No.
Don't you understand?
It's the only way. I've got to go to him.
We'll find the wreck, I tell you.
We don't have time.
Oh, please, Alan, let me do it.
No, and don't talk anymore.
But why should three of you die...
They've given us up.
They're gonna leave without us.
Oh, shut up, will you?
You know something, Lieutenant, you're a dead duck just like all the rest of us.
You think I'm blind?
We're all gonna die because of her!
That's enough!
He's right, Alan.
We're not making any deals with Hunter, not the kind he wants.
Why don't you let Maggie talk for herself?
You, too, Jack?
What's the matter, Alan?
Losing your sense of humor?
Well, what are we waiting for?
Let's find that wreck.
We got two whole days.
Come on, Steve. Pick up where you left off.
I'll keep on working the south end.
I think, darling, we'd better try...
Maggie!
Maggie, where are you?
Get back! Get back!
Where's that wreck? Where's that wreck?
MAGGlE: Stop it! Stop it!
Not before he talks.
No!
No!
Where is it? Where's that wreck?
Tell me or I'll... Where's that wreck? Talk!
No!
You're gonna rot here.
Talk! Talk!
Get out of my way.
You've lost your mind.
Maybe you wanna stay here for the rest of your life, but not me!
You're not gonna touch him.
Go ahead, Steve.
We're not gonna dig our way out of here through human flesh.
Not Maggie's, Hunter's, not even yours.
Jack.
Get out.
No one asked you to come here.
We want to help you.
I don't need your help or your pity.
We all need pity, and we all need help.
Here. It's a map.
It'll show you where the wreck is.
Take it. And leave me alone.
We'll find it.
If it's true that you can't live among beasts without becoming one, then it's just as true that you can't live among human beings without becoming affected by their humanity.
Let's get started.
Come on, Maggie.
I'll stay with Hunter.
I'll be all right.
We must have passed this place 20 times.
It'll work.
Okay, Jack. Give it a whirl.
Well, if it doesn't run this time, we've had it.
The battery's just about shot.
Jack, is there anything we can do?
Let's check the ignition system again.
I'm going back to camp.
No! You stay here!
Something's happened to them.
Something's happened to them!
Well, she's running smooth as a watch.
Kick in the rotor and let's see what happens.
Yeah, here goes.
What is it, Steve?
The new rod needs adjusting.
We'll be all right.
How about it, Steve?
I need a little more time.
It's okay now!
Let's go.
Look! There's Maggie and Hunter.
Steve! Get the winch ready.
Oh, look!
Jack, get as close as you can.
Right.
Hello, Task Force W. This is Helicopter X-3.
We're airborne and trying to intercept you.
Give us a heading. We're low on fuel.
Repeat, give us a heading,
Hello, Helicopter X-3. Hello, Helicopter X-3.
Our radar has you spotted.
Take a heading of 51 degrees,
We will intercept you,
Proceed to flight deck on the north wind,
We've everything ready for you, Over,
Received your message.
We're coming in. Out.
Hey, there they are!
Probably will be another expedition next year.
Would you like to come along?
No, thanks. I've had it.
Anyway, the OP likes to rotate assignments.
I wasn't thinking of it exactly as an assignment.
Oh? What then?
Well, sort of a honeymoon, sort of?
At the South Pole?
Well, it's one way of keeping warm.
That's ridiculous, Alan.
Yeah, I guess it is.
Why, who'd stay home with the baby?
Sure, who'd stay...
What baby?
Ours, silly.
Why, by this time next year...
This is Sand Rock, Arizona, of a late evening in early spring.
It's a nice town, knowing its past and sure of its future as it makes ready for the night and the predictable morning.
The desert blankets the earth, cooling, resting for the fight with tomorrow's sun.
And in my house, near the town, we are also sure of the future.
So very sure.
Mmm. 12:00, sharp.
Trying to get rid of me?
'Cause if you are, it won't do you any good.
Well, I wouldn't want people to talk.
- Let them. They do it anyway.
- Mmm.
You know, I think it must be my money that impresses you.
What money?
Well, I got a check today.
- Johnny, you sold another article!
- Uh-huh.
Got enough to finish the outside of the house.
All the comforts of home.
To think of the time
I wasted living in the city.
It's nice out here.
Question is, would you keep this up if we were married?
Of course not.
As soon as I got your name on the marriage certificate,
I wouldn't have to do it anymore.
Let's go see what the stars have to say.
I already know your horoscope.
You know who the stars say a man born under your sign should marry?
No, who?
Me.
I'm a Scorpio, and a Scorpio always gets along well with a Sagittarius.
- Really?
- Mmm-hmm.
What else do they say?
Oh, a Sagittarius is philosophical and very positive.
And has a blithe, happy-go-lucky manner.
Would starve if someone didn't come along to make him a meal occasionally.
And is quite helpless in certain situations.
Come here, look at my stars.
Tell me if they say whether a Sagittarius could support a Scorpio.
"Starlight, star bright
First star I've seen tonight
"I wish I may, I wish I might
"Have the wish I wish tonight"
What was that?
A meteor.
One of the biggest.
- Can you see it?
- Yeah.
Yeah, there it is.
It's by the old Excelsior Mine.
You're crazy.
He's dead serious.
Didn't you even hear it?
I didn't hear nothing until you kept banging on my door.
Look!
Oh, it's beautiful!
Come on, come on, let's go down.
All right, all right, keep your shirt on.
Holy cow!
Brother, that's really something.
It's the biggest thing that's ever happened in our time.
I'm gonna take a closer look.
Oh, be careful, John.
Go ahead, be a hero.
We'll take our chances.
Who said anything about you?
You stay right here.
You look after Pete.
This is where Pete's going to be, right here.
Johnny! Johnny!
Wait a minute. You stay here.
John!
I'm all right, Pete. Down here.
Are you all right?
Yeah, I'm all right.
Come on, let's get out of here.
Maybe you'll listen to me next time.
John! John, are you all right?
Johnny? Johnny.
Yeah, I wasn't hurt, Ellen.
Well, then, what's the matter?
There's something down there.
Boy, you're not kidding. A couple of tons of earth that almost hit you.
No, that's not what I mean.
What do you mean?
What was it you saw down there?
I'm not sure.
Some kind of a ship, I think.
- A what?
- A ship.
What kind of a ship?
I don't know.
It's like nothing we've ever seen before.
Look, something must have hit this guy in the head. Come on.
It sounds crazy, but I tell you it was there.
Part of it was still showing.
Look, boy, you've been up in the stars too long.
Now, come on, let's get out of here.
It's like a huge ball, rammed there in the side of the crater.
Look, this is no place to hold a conversation.
Come on, let's go before it starts falling again.
All right, all right.
I'm not crazy, and I'm not imagining.
I tell you, I saw this thing.
Oh, brother.
I saw an open portway.
- So, what was inside?
- Well...
Something. Then the door slammed shut and started the landslide.
That figures. Come on.
- Pete, will you listen to me?
- I did.
I let maniacs drag me off in the middle of the night.
Now, on top of that,
I get rocket ships thrown at me.
Uh-oh.
Here they come to find out what happened.
Oh, please. Don't tell them what you told us.
Ellen, I tell you,
I was close enough to it.
I could have reached out and touched it.
Oh, Johnny, please.
You're not going to tell those people you saw Martians running around down there?
What would you say if I had found a Martian down there?
I'd say, "Hold him for a circus."
I'd say, "Wait and find out what they're doing here, first."
Ellen, you don't believe me, either.
Oh, I don't know.
That's Ellen and Putnam.
There's Pete's 'copter. Hi!
Hey, what's going on?
How long you been up here?
What happened?
- I'll tell you what happened.
- Johnny.
It's a meteor. Johnny says the biggest one that ever hit us.
It must've been.
I felt it clear down to my shoes.
Lit up the sky like the end of all creation.
It was no meteor.
No meteor?
What's the amateur astronomer's point of view?
There's some kind of a ship down there.
A ship?
Don't ask me what kind,
'cause I don't know.
You mean from one of those stars you write about?
Or the kind that Pete, here, operates?
I tell you, the evidence is buried right down there.
This may be the biggest thing that's ever happened.
If you're smart, you'll get this whole area sealed off until we know what we're up against.
You see it, Ellen?
No, but if John says he saw it...
He could be mistaken. You, Pete?
I tell you, from its size and its appearance, this thing came from outer space.
I even have reason to believe that there's some form of life in it.
Must've been traveling pretty fast to hit the Earth that hard and stay in one piece.
That's right.
And even if it was in one piece, would anyone still walk around after a concussion like that?
I'm just asking, Johnny.
I want to make sure
I quote you right for the paper.
I'll take you home, Ellen.
I don't mind, Matt. I'll be all right.
Don't tell me you're going back to Sand Rock.
When Loring gets through printing that statement of yours in his paper, they won't let you walk around out in the open.
Oh, you too, Pete?
We need help, not lecturing.
Come on, Ellen.
Isn't there anyone who would want to help?
What about Dr. Snell at the Wayne Observatory?
You've done a lot of work with him.
Yeah. I'll call him as soon as we get back.
Hey, slow down.
Johnny?
Those fools.
Oh, you can't really blame them.
But I did see it.
I even saw some kind of tracks.
I can't be just imagining it.
Oh, I'm thinking of you, Johnny.
And people talking behind your back and laughing.
Mmm. They've talked about me before.
Even your old friend, the Sheriff.
Matt didn't mean anything by it.
He's known me all my life.
You know how he looks after me.
I don't blame any of them.
Can I prove it? Even to myself?
Well, maybe if we really do find something...
You really have to, Johnny?
I have to, Ellen.
You'd better keep out of it for a while, though.
I wouldn't want them laughing at you.
Look.
What's that?
What was that?
I don't know.
Did you hit it?
I'll see.
Keep the motor running, Johnny, please.
Yeah.
You stay here.
Come on, let's get back.
What is it?
Thought I heard something.
It's just a Joshua tree.
Let's get out of here.
- Did you get any good shots?
- Pretty good.
The crater's about 1,000 yards around.
One of the biggest things that ever happened.
Look how far down it goes.
Sure covers a wide area.
Hey, here comes our stargazer now.
Come on.
Snell's here.
- So are the reporters.
- Uh-oh.
And here they come.
I'll try and steer them off.
- Good morning, John. Ellen.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
- Missed you out at the house.
Dugan, American Press.
Lober, Press Dispatch.
Gentlemen, this is Miss Fields.
How do you do?
Quite a show you started. Any statement?
Why repeat it? It's all right here.
"Star gazer sees Martians."
Well...
Stick around, I may really have something for you in a few minutes.
Look, this is private. Do you mind?
Not at all.
How about it, Miss Fields?
- You add anything to this?
- No.
- Hiya, Bob.
- Hi.
Well, well, John.
Hello, Dr. Snell. Glad you could get away.
I wouldn't have missed it for anything.
- How long you been here?
- About an hour.
Oh, you've just gotten started then.
Well, hardly. I've seen enough.
But you do believe me?
Look, John, last night you saw a meteor fall to earth.
That much has been substantiated by witnesses.
The presence of the crater itself, its formation and characteristics, all support the theory that it was a meteor.
But I tell you, I saw a ship.
You saw something that looked like a ship.
You can't prove it, John.
I can prove it if I can get you to help me dig it out of there.
I can't in good faith ask the University to do it.
We'd dig for months, and spend thousands, and maybe all we'd find would be these.
Look, note the black coloring, characteristic of the meteor.
The fusion from heat, the nickel and the iron. Facts, John. Facts.
Even the angle of contact with the earth.
Everything points towards it being a meteor.
All right, all right. I'll admit
I don't have all the answers...
And one more point, John. Come on.
Find anything, Bob?
No, Doctor. Not a thing.
There you are. See, there's no sign of any excessive radioactivity anywhere in the area.
Odd, wouldn't you say, for something coming in from outer space?
I don't know what's odd and what isn't anymore.
But I do know I expected you to be more open to the idea than the others.
You're a man of science!
And therefore less inclined to witchcraft, John.
Not witchcraft, Dr. Snell. Imagination.
Willingness to believe that there are lots of things that we don't know anything about.
Look, there was a time when people thought the Earth was a level plain between two mountains that were set there to hold up the sky.
And that the stars were lamps hung from that sky.
Then a better idea came along, and people were willing to listen.
Be realistic, John.
We've worked together before.
In the meantime, you can do an article for us.
Yeah.
Here. I already have.
An intense young man.
Yeah, and an odd one, too.
More than odd, Bob. Individual and lonely.
A man who thinks for himself.
"Report on the Arrival of Strangers from Outer Space."
I had been hoping I'd run into you, Putnam.
What's the matter, Matt?
Did I break a law or something?
Hey, you might call it that.
Ellen's supposed to be teaching school today.
I told her to stay out of this.
You know Ellen.
Yeah, I know Ellen. I also knew her father. I was his deputy.
And I mean to keep an eye on her.
Trouble is she keeps trailing after you.
See, this town doesn't understand you.
Poking around out here in the desert, squinting up at the stars.
And now you come up with this story.
"This town"...
The reason I came out here to the desert was to try and get away from that kind of thinking.
Putnam, you frighten them.
And what frightens them, they're against. One way or another.
Look, Matt. I'm frightened, too.
You want to destroy yourself, that's your lookout.
But leave Ellen alone.
She needs her job.
Come on, Miss Fields. Give us a story.
Smile, please, Miss Fields.
Joe, get her, will you?
What about this monster you ran into last night?
Come on, fellows, come on.
Stop bothering her, will you?
Just checking your story.
What are you trying to prove?
That's what I was going to ask you.
Maybe you're getting publicity for a new book you're writing.
John...
Don't get sore, Putnam. You're news now.
Just trying to get a story!
Snell agrees with the Sheriff, and the Sheriff agrees with the others.
- I'm crazy.
- Oh, I know.
Matt was at me before he found you.
"A teacher has responsibilities to the community."
I just wish we had found one of them, that's all.
Just one little monster to toss into the principal's bedroom.
An occasion to make the soul tremble.
Thank you, sir.
This is your local announcer again, and here's Major Benson, of the United
States Army, to give us his view.
Major, will the army attempt to dig underneath the crater?
Uh, probably not.
Well, Major, how do you feel about the report that a spaceship is buried there?
If there is, it'll have to wait until we can get around to it.
Then the army isn't afraid of any invaders?
Well, Not if they are buried under hundreds of tons of...
Look.
Seems like it'll reach out.
Hmm.
It's alive.
And yet it looks so dead out there.
Oh, no, it's alive and waiting for you.
Ready to kill you if you go too far.
The sun will get you, the cold at night.
A thousand ways the desert can kill.
Where are you?
What do you look like?
What am I supposed to be looking for?
I know you're out there, hiding in the desert.
Maybe I'm looking right at you and don't even see you.
Come on out.
But, John.
Hiya, Frank. George.
Well, where'd you two come from?
Why aren't you back at the crater?
I don't much like the show they're putting on over there.
Hear they got you going, John.
Are they riding you, boy?
They're trying to.
I read the morning papers.
Don't let them ride you too much.
Uh-huh.
Have you two seen anything unusual this morning?
You mean, like another meteor?
No, I don't mean like a meteor.
No, we ain't seen nothing. Have we, Frank?
- Have we, Frank?
- What?
I said we haven't seen nothing, have we?
No, I haven't seen anything.
But I'm sure hearing things.
Yeah?
What kind of things?
Well, I don't know. Darndest noise ever.
Never heard anything like it on the wires before.
Ah, you've been out in the sun all morning.
No, it's not the sun.
- Mind if I give a listen?
- Sure.
Put him on the ladder, George.
You're the boss.
Here, listen.
You hear it?
Yeah.
Any idea what it is?
I don't know.
It might be somebody up that way tapping the wires, or back that way, listening to us, like we're listening to him.
I wonder who it is.
I don't know.
After you've been working out on the desert fifteen years, like I have, you hear a lot of things.
See a lot of things, too.
Sun in the sky, and the heat.
All that sand out there with the rivers, lakes, that aren't real at all.
And sometimes you think that the wind gets in the wires and hums, and listens, and talks.
Just like what we're hearing now.
Still hear it?
No, it's gone.
Well, that's the way it is.
Comes and goes.
- Had enough?
- Yeah.
Me, too.
Well, what do you make of it?
I'm not sure yet.
Wish I could figure it out.
Why don't we drive up the line a ways and take a squint?
Anything you say, boss.
We'll have a look up the other way.
If you find anything, let us know.
Be glad to.
Got a big date with Jane tonight, boss.
If you're thinking of getting off early, the answer is no.
When are you gonna get married and settle down, George?
Soon as I find me a wife like yours.
You always say the right thing, don't you?
Especially to the boss.
- Look at that!
- What is it?
Did you see something, John?
No. No, nothing up here.
We'd better go back and find Frank and George.
Do you think they'll find something?
Could be.
- There.
- Yeah.
Wait.
Maybe they walked off in the desert.
Why would they leave the doors open?
They were in a hurry, all right.
Maybe they chased something.
Or something chased them.
Blood.
Look, Johnny.
They saw something, all right.
Whatever it was, it took them along.
George.
Hello.
- You gave us a start.
- Did I?
Where's Frank?
George, where's Frank?
He went off to look around.
There's blood on the truck. What happened?
I cut my hand. See?
Is it bad...
What's wrong?
Nothing. The sun, I guess.
Playing tricks on me.
Yes, the sun. Beautiful.
You...
You found nothing up here?
Nothing.
We may as well get along, Johnny.
Don't worry about Frank.
He'll be all right.
Yes.
Well, I guess there's nothing more we can do up here.
So long, George.
We'll be in touch with you.
So long.
What is it back there, John?
What's the matter with his eyes?
He's lying. I didn't want to start anything alone out here.
We've got to get into town and bring help.
Something's happened to Frank.
He's dead.
Are you all right?
What happened, George? Is the truck...
Don't be afraid.
It is within our power to transform ourselves to look like you, or anyone.
For a time, it will be necessary.
We cannot, we would not take your souls, or minds, or bodies.
Don't be afraid.
Your friend is all right.
- Mind closing the door?
- You're coming right out with us, Matt.
You wanted some proof, Matt?
Maybe we've got something for you now.
School principal was in here.
You've got to listen to him, Matt.
You're supposed to be teaching school.
Don't you hear us, Matt?
We've got some proof for you now.
I'm a busy man, Ellen.
And even if I wasn't, he's not going to make a fool out of me, the way he has of you.
If you don't listen to him, you'll be the fool.
He's got you so you'll believe anything.
All right, just what did you see?
Come on, I'll show it to you.
You better bring your gun.
The truck's gone.
It was right there, Matt.
This time I saw, too.
The tracks, Johnny. Show him.
- The tracks are gone.
- Mmm-hmm.
Right here. This is where I saw him.
I saw his hand.
Look. Blood.
Could have been a jackrabbit hit by a car, and crawled in through here.
I tell you, it was Frank. It had to be.
All right, it was Frank, and he's risen from the dead and gone off with his truck.
Now, I'm going back to town.
Thanks for the ride.
It's like beating against thin air.
No marks, no signs, no nothing.
And, Ellen, the pallor of that face.
Maybe it was the sun, just playing tricks on us.
Was it?
The way he kept looking into the sun without blinking.
How could George do it?
George couldn't.
What do you mean?
It's like some nightmare, where you're waiting and hoping for it to be over and then all of a sudden, you realize that it's just...
George? Frank?
Frank? George?
Wait! I want to talk to you.
George? Frank?
Keep away.
Where have you been?
We've been looking all over for you.
I want to help you.
What happened out there, in the desert?
Tell me, and we'll go to the Sheriff.
Stand back.
Whoever you are, whatever you are,
I want to understand you.
I want to help you.
Then keep away.
Keep away, John Putnam.
We don't want to hurt you.
You least of all.
We don't want to hurt anyone.
What have you done with them?
Your friends are alive.
They will not be harmed, if you do as we say.
What are we supposed to do?
Give us time.
Time, or terrible things will happen.
Things so terrible, you have yet to dream of them.
Is old Tom back with that grub yet?
I sure am getting powerful hungry.
Ain't seen him yet.
Ain't to my liking neither, hauling grub at this time of the night.
Come on, mule.
Sam and Toby will be hungry.
Why, you crazy mule!
That you, Tom?
What's going on in there?
Well, the way to tell is take a look.
It's just this poor old tunnel.
Needs more propping up.
Like a man gets old. Needs propping up.
Wouldn't have needed it, if that meteor hadn't stuck its nose smack in that lower level.
Yeah, we best check it in the morning.
Must be Tom now.
Well, it took him long enough.
That you, Tom?
No one has yet turned up any bug-eyed monsters threatening Earth, and so it must be set down as another one of those fantastic hoaxes.
This one by a young, publicity-seeking astronomer.
Of course, if he should turn up a spaceman or two, this network cordially invites them to address us, one and all.
And now, for some last-minute news.
I was trying to help.
- What do we do now?
- Nothing. We wait.
We sit and we wait and we trust them to make it clear for us.
Come on. I'll take you home.
You've got nothing to blame yourself about, John.
What else could you do?
But, Ellen, are we right in just sitting by?
We are right, and we're not crazy.
And if we've been seeing things, it's because we did see them.
Evening, Miss Fields.
What's the idea, Perry?
Sheriff wants to see Johnny.
Yeah? What are you made-up for?
I'm a spaceman, out of the crater.
Says for you to get over there, right away.
Okay, okay.
See you.
Matt.
You know Frank's wife, Mrs. Daylon.
Of course.
- How do you do?
- Miss Dean, a friend of George's.
- Hello, Jane.
- Hi.
Mrs. Daylon, tell John, here, what you told me.
Well, the minute he came home,
I knew there was something wrong.
It seems Frank took off under peculiar circumstances.
He came home and told her he was assigned to some sort of special job overnight, and left.
Something's wrong, I know it.
He was so pale, he had the queerest look in his eyes, and he never touched his food.
Same for George.
His landlady told me he skipped dinner.
And that ain't like George, not with his appetite.
Mr. Putnam, the Sheriff says that you saw both of them this afternoon.
Did they say anything about going anywhere tonight?
No, Mrs. Daylon. Not a thing.
Well, maybe they had an emergency call to make.
Telephone people say no.
And that truck we couldn't find this afternoon.
The phone company called up and reported it missing.
Were they drunk or anything?
I mean, did you get it on their breath?
Frank never drinks. He's sick, I tell you.
If you ask me, they ain't ever coming back.
Otherwise, what would they want to take their clothes for?
- Their clothes?
- Yes.
It seems natural to take a change of clothes, they said they'd be gone overnight, didn't they?
I know George. Always on the move, always wanting to go somewhere.
You best go home and get some sleep, the both of you.
I'll check around and call you later.
Ellen, Johnny and I have some things to talk over.
Would you mind taking the ladies home?
Of course, and I'll stay with Mrs. Daylon for a while, too.
- We're taking your car, Johnny.
- I'll see you later, Ellen.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Now are you ready to believe me?
I'm trying to, or I wouldn't have sent for you.
You've got to believe that there's a ship buried out there in the desert.
And that at least some of our visitors from outer space got out of that ship before it was covered over.
Go on.
Two of those visitors I saw today, and so did you.
It's true, Matt.
Oh, it's no use, Johnny.
I try to stay with you, but I can't.
You've got to.
I know what you're thinking, Matt.
But you've got to believe that what you saw today was only what looked like Frank and George.
They didn't, by any chance, tell you what they wanted?
They want us to trust them.
To believe that Frank and George are in no danger as long as we don't interfere with them.
To give them time! Time!
Did it occur to you that you might be gambling with their lives?
Yeah, what do you think you were doing when you refused to believe me?
Frank and George, that's crazy.
I tell you, I came face to face with them.
But how could they take over anyone else's form?
- And where's the real Frank and George?
- I don't know.
And why would they want to do that? Why?
Maybe to move about freely.
To come into town without being stopped.
So they steal a telephone truck, something that'll stick out like a torch.
Now, does that make sense?
It might. Suppose they wanted electrical equipment.
That truck was loaded with it.
As a matter of fact, things have been happening around here this evening.
The hardware store was broken into.
And they're missing a coil of copper wire and some metal parts.
Nothing else taken but electrical equipment.
There you are.
Yeah? Yeah, this is Sheriff Warren.
No, the last I saw of Dr. Snell and his assistant, they were out at the crater.
You let me know if you hear anything, and if I hear anything, I'll give you a ring.
What about Dr. Snell?
Would they have any use for him?
They might. He's an astronomer. Why?
That was his secretary calling.
They haven't seen him or his assistant.
Last I saw of them, they were out on the desert, working alone.
Let's go.
They're not around here and it's a cinch they just didn't leave without their car.
I'd give anything if things were back the way were this morning with me calling you a fool.
Is it reasonable for anything to stay alive, after hitting Earth that hard?
It's reasonable, because it's true.
Believing all this talk about taking over other people's forms.
That's crazy, I tell you.
Nothing would ever add up.
I couldn't even be sure that you're
John Putnam standing beside me.
That's right, you couldn't.
Wouldn't it be a fine trick if I weren't really John Putnam at all?
Something from another world, come here to give you a lot of false leads.
Frank, what are you doing here?
I have been waiting for you.
We've been looking all over for you.
- Are you all right?
- Yes.
I'll take you home.
No. Take me to the mine.
Oh, no. No, please.
Hello? Who is this?
Who?
It's for you.
This is John Putnam.
What?
But...
Yes.
They've got Ellen.
Ellen?
- Where?
- Come on.
How do you know we're supposed to stop here?
- I know.
- Well, let's go.
No. They want to see me alone.
You wait here.
I was thinking about Ellen.
So am I.
She's safe, but if you come along,
I don't know.
All right, I'll wait. How long?
As long as it takes.
Well, be careful.
Ellen?
Ellen!
Ellen, wait!
Ellen?
Ellen?
Ellen.
Here.
Here.
Where's Ellen? Where's Ellen?
Stay where you are.
Come out in the open.
Come out where I can see you.
No.
Let me see you as you really are.
What do you want? What are you doing?
We are repairing our ship to leave your world.
We need your help.
You ask me to help you.
How can I, when you've kidnapped and stolen?
For all I know, even murdered.
We have a long way to go.
By nightfall, we will have left your Earth.
You will not see us until it is time.
Time for what? Time to kill?
Time to take over?
We have souls and minds, and we are good.
Then why are you hiding?
We are not yet ready to meet in friendship.
Why not?
Because you would be horrified at the sight of us.
Had you fallen on our world, it might have been different.
We understand more.
All I understand is that you've taken my friends captive.
And now the girl.
We hold her hostage, as well as the others.
Keep your people away, or we will destroy them.
How do I know that your whole mission here isn't to destroy all of us?
Our mission was to another world.
You must believe me.
Only an error dragged us toward Earth.
Stand out in the sun.
In time, perhaps.
Then I can't believe you.
Let us stay apart, the people of your world and ours.
For if we come together, there will only be destruction.
I've got to see you as you really are.
Come out, or I can't take the responsibility of protecting you.
Very well, then. You asked to see this.
So you shall.
Where's Ellen?
- She's safe.
- Where?
What did they do to you?
Nothing.
Men don't look the way you look for nothing.
I saw them, Matt.
I saw them as they really are.
Horrible.
You left Ellen with them?
She's safe, as long as we don't interfere.
Maybe that's the way you want it, but not me.
I want Ellen and the rest of them out now.
You think I would've walked off and left her if I didn't have to?
They're leaving tonight.
They crashed here by mistake, and now they're fixing their ship to get out!
They can't get out.
They're buried under tons of earth.
Now take me to Ellen.
I tell you, she's safe as long as you don't interfere!
Then why don't they come out in the open?
Because they don't trust us.
Because what we don't understand, we want to destroy.
I kill only what tries to kill me.
That spider, why are you afraid of it?
Because it has eight legs?
Because its mouth moves from side to side, instead of up and down?
If it came towards you, what would you do?
This.
Exactly as you'd destroy anything you didn't understand.
Don't you see, Matt?
That's why they've been hiding behind other men's faces until they can clear out.
You're wasting time.
Are you going to tell me where they are or do I form a posse and run the desert with a net until we find them?
Once before you wouldn't believe me.
When are you going to stop being a badge and become a human being?
That's my job.
A thing is wrong, you set it right.
Matt, listen to me. They weren't fooling.
They need a few more hours.
If you go to them with men now, they'll kill Ellen!
Is that what you want?
All right, we'll wait.
But the responsibility is yours.
Now, where are they?
They're in the old Excelsior mineshaft.
Now, come on, come on.
Let's get back to town.
I want everyone out of the area.
No exceptions.
Reed, make it sound like there's nothing to it.
I think you're making a mistake.
This fellow Putnam, he's done nothing but talk you out of things and get his own way.
He runs you ragged.
Now he's got you sitting by, just waiting.
So far, we don't know any more than we knew at the beginning.
And Ellen's still missing. If I was you,
I'd get them rifles into the hands of some men and clean it up, whatever it is.
I gave you an order, now get going!
Okay, Sheriff.
But I wouldn't want the responsibility.
Well, I'm playing it your way, right down the line.
Even clearing everyone away from the crater.
That's the way you wanted it, right?
It's got to be right.
What are you doing here?
I thought you were going to sweat it out at home.
They paid me a visit, Matt.
They took some of my clothes.
- Why do you suppose they'd do that?
- I don't know.
Couldn't be that they've been lying to you, could it?
That old mine they've been hiding in.
There were three men working it.
They ever tell you what happened to them?
What do they want with so many of us?
What are they planning, Johnny?
- Are they telling the truth, or what?
- You keep throwing these questions at me.
All I can do is guess.
Now your clothes, too.
Could be any one of them.
Stop working yourself up, Matt. It's hot enough without raising your blood pressure.
Yeah.
Did you know, Putnam, that more murders are committed at 92 degrees Fahrenheit than any other temperature?
I read an article once.
Lower temperatures, people are easy-going.
Over 92, it's too hot to move.
But just 92, people get irritable.
That clock...
Don't do anything.
Look at him.
Walking around like he belongs here.
The sooner they finish, the sooner they'll clear out.
How do we know they're really walking around in our clothes or Frank's, or George's, or Ellen's?
We've come this far, we've got to see it through.
What do you mean, "see it through"?
How do we know they're not taking over?
They could be all around us and I wouldn't know it.
- Hey, you! Wait right there!
- Matt!
Stay where you are.
Sorry, Matt.
It was the only way I could stop you.
Johnny, come here.
You guys in the park, over there.
Sir, you in the truck. I need help.
All the help I can get.
Look, some guy's taking off in your car.
We'll get to him later. Come on.
All right, Bill, pass out those rifles, will you?
You head for the point at the highway and we'll cut off the truck by taking the east route.
- Mike, Harry, come with me.
- Okay.
Cut out into the desert here, and set up the barricade here.
All right, men, follow me!
All right, men, spread out across the road.
Throw some flares up in the front, and put some in the back, there.
There's his truck.
That's it, put another one over there.
All right. Check your guns and check your ammunition now.
He'll be coming any minute.
Here he comes now.
Hold your fire. Get ready.
All right. Let him have it.
Who's there?
Ellen?
Ellen?
No, you're not Ellen.
You're dressed in her clothes, but you're not Ellen.
They're on their way here.
You brought them.
Listen to me.
I came here to warn you.
I tried to stop them, you don't know how I tried.
You've got to get out.
Just a few more hours.
Listen to me.
You wanted me to fall into that. Why?
You can no longer be trusted.
Whoever you are, whatever you are, listen to me!
I'm sorry.
We did not want to use violence.
Now there's no other way.
Would you kill me, too?
So this is the end?
The grand total of all our dreams.
I came here to help you, not to kill.
Stay where you are.
Yes, look at its power.
Power to drive a ship through space.
Power to tear your Earth apart.
You know how long we've worked on this?
A thousand years of reaching for the stars.
Now, at last, we've conquered space.
Ah. The dreams we had of knowing other worlds.
Listen to me. There's still a way.
Is there? With a mob after us?
All we needed was time.
Let the others go.
I'll try and hold off the mob.
And if you fail?
No. We'd rather have it end here, than fall into their hands.
Wait!
You speak of how wonderful it was going to be to know other worlds.
A thousand years of work, and you're willing to see it all end here, abruptly, on this strange planet?
Is that the way you want it?
When there might still be a chance?
Then go and stop them.
Free the girl first. Show the mob you mean them no harm.
How can I trust you?
You can always reach out and destroy us with that.
Send them out.
Johnny.
Come on, quick.
Come on.
There's the entrance.
Clear away, everybody.
Clear away. Keep running, Ellen.
Hey. Hey. Any way to close off this entrance?
There's some dynamite back there.
Get it. Quick. Get it.
Hurry up. We've got to keep that posse away from them.
Were they in there?
Yeah.
I guess that takes care of them.
Yeah. That takes care of them.
What's that?
Wait. Listen.
Well, they've gone.
For good, John?
No, just for now.
It wasn't the right time for us to meet.
But there'll be other nights.
Other stars for us to watch.
They'll be back.
The strange, almost unbelievable, story of Robert Scott Carey... began on a very ordinary summer day.
I know this story better than anyone because I am Robert Scott Carey.
This is the way to spend a vacation.
I'm thirsty.
That sun feels good.
- I'm thirsty.
- Interesting.
- A cold bottle of beer'd taste fine.
- Why don't you get it?
Me?
- I'm on vacation. All week.
- Well, so am I, my friend.
Louise?
- I think we should get married.
- We've been married six years.
Really? Seems like six minutes.
I am not gonna get you that beer.
I provided the boat.
You provide the beer.
- Your brother provided the boat.
- I'll make you a deal.
What?
You get the beer, I'll get the dinner.
How's that?
Okay. You got yourself a deal.
To the galley, wench.
Fetch me a flagon of beer.
I'm sorry, Captain, but we're out of flagons.
It'll have to be a can.
Out of flagons? In the name of Heaven's, woman, how are we to make the Philippines?
We're not going, sir.
We're going home at the end of the week.
Mutiny.
- Make 'em cold!
- Like ice.
- Scott, what was that?
- I don't know. Some kind of mist.
Look at your chest.
But then, on an equally ordinary day, six months later.
- Morning, Joe.
- Morning, Mrs. Carey.
- Looks like a nice day, huh?
- See you tomorrow.
Here, kitty-kitty-kitty.
Here, kitty-kitty-kitty. Come on, Butch.
That's a boy. There you go.
- Scott? Scott, are you dressed yet?
- I'll be right there.
All right.
- Lou?
- Yes, dear?
You sure you got the right pants from the cleaners?
Just a second.
- You asked that yesterday morning.
- They still don't fit.
- They still too loose?
- The cuffs are draggin'.
They do look kinda big.
I dunno what that cleaner's doing, but tell him to cut it out.
You're just losing weight.
It's very becoming, so don't complain.
- You want one or two eggs?
- One.
One? Now that's why your pants don't fit.
- Lou?
- Yeah?
Hey, the shirt doesn't fit either.
It's your shirt.
It's got your monogram on it.
- What's that supposed...
- Eat your breakfast and forget it.
I know a lot of people who'd like to lose weight. What's your secret?
- Maybe it's the cooking around here.
- Well, thanks a lot. Drink your juice.
- Lou, do me a favour.
- What, honey?
- Pick up a bathroom scale today.
- All right.
Still get five foot eleven inches,
Mr. Carey.
I've been six foot one since I was 17.
- What's the weight?
- Still 174 and a quarter pounds.
I don't understand it.
That's a loss of almost ten pounds.
I told you, you're probably overworking yourself.
You told me that when you overwork you get nervous and lose weight.
But I've never lost that much weight.
Besides, I haven't been particularly nervous lately.
Not eating wouldn't make me lose height, would it?
Oh, I very much doubt if you've been losing height, Mr. Carey.
Why don't you put your things on?
You told me that you've been six foot one since you were 17 years old.
That's right.
How many physical examinations have you had since then?
Oh, the draft board, the Navy, a life insurance physical.
That's not too many.
It's possible there might have been errors made on all of them as regards your height.
It often happens. A number of things could cause such errors.
If you stood erect, you'd measure out as taller than you actually are.
Or if your height was taken in the morning, you'd measure out as taller.
Why's that?
Because people decrease in height during the day.
See, the body weight compresses the spinal discs, the bone joints and so on.
I see. Two inches, Doctor?
I wouldn't worry about it, Mr. Carey.
As far as I can see you're in perfect health.
Likely lost a little weight due to an insufficient diet but...
People don't get shorter, Mr. Carey.
They just don't get shorter.
What'd Charlie think about your idea for the ad?
Oh, he thinks it has possibilities.
- Well?
- Four pounds.
- Up or down?
- Down.
That does it, my boy.
You're gonna start taking vitamins.
I'm gonna get you so fat on ice cream and cake... you'll think you're living in a child's paradise.
- I don't think that's gonna fix it.
- Then we'll see a doctor.
- You're due for a checkup anyway.
- I've already seen a doctor.
- When?
- A week ago.
Well, honey, why didn't you say something about it?
Come here, Louise.
- Kiss me.
- You think that's gonna fix it, huh?
You didn't have to stretch.
You used to stand on your toes.
What? In your stocking feet?
I'm getting smaller, Lou. Every day.
Well, that's silly, honey.
People just don't get smaller.
Yeah. Yeah, you're right.
We'll go back to the doctor tomorrow.
I'm sure he's got a pill for it.
Don't worry, Butch. Everything's gonna be all right. Go to bed.
Well, that's the last of them,
Mr. Carey.
- This has been a long week, Dr. Bramson.
- I must have worn out your machine.
I needed two full sets of pictures spaced several days apart.
I had to compare them before I...
Before I could be sure.
Sure of what, Doctor? What is it?
Relax, Doctor, you can't tell me anything I haven't imagined.
You are getting smaller.
I... I don't profess to understand it,
Mr. Carey.
There's no medical precedent for what's happening to you.
I simply know that you're getting smaller.
The X-rays prove it beyond any doubt.
But that's impossible.
That's what we've always believed,
Mrs. Carey.
I'm gonna send you to the California
Medical Research Institute.
If there is an explanation for your phenomenon, why...
They'll find it.
Then began a series of intensive tests.
I drank a barium solution, and stood behind a fluoroscope screen.
They gave me radioactive iodine.
And an examination with a Geiger counter.
I had electrodes fastened to my head.
Water restriction tests, protein bond tests, eye tests, blood cultures...
X-rays and more X-rays.
Tests, endless tests.
And then one day in the third week the final examination.
A paper chromatography test.
Now don't be despondent, Mr. Carey.
At least we've found out what is happening to you.
Gradual loss of nitrogen, calcium, phosphorus.
- This test may tell us why.
- I hope so.
I think the strip should be dry by now.
We should find phospholipid... amino acids, cholesterol, creatinine, and protein.
These are the elements most commonly found on the strip.
Wait a minute.
This one doesn't belong.
It certainly doesn't belong.
Here, take a look.
Our analysis shows that it's a rearrangement... of the molecular structure of the cells in your body.
- You mean like a cancer?
- No.
No, more like an anti-cancer, causing a diminution of all the organs.
Then you know what's causing me to get smaller.
We think we do, Mr. Carey.
That's why I asked you here.
Now I want you to tell me something.
Have you ever been accidentally exposed to any kind of germ spray?
In particular, an insecticide, a great deal of it.
- Insecticide?
- Exactly.
Has there ever been a time when you were so exposed?
Do you remember that day
I told you about the truck?
Yes, about two months ago.
I was on my way to the store through an alley.
As I was walking a truck turned in.
It was spraying trees.
- Is that what's causing me to...
- No, that was only the beginning.
You see, something happened to that insecticide after it was in your system.
Something fantastic and unprecedented.
Something which, in layman's terms... so affected the insecticide that from a mildly virulent germ spray... it created deadly chemical reversal of the growth process.
Have you been exposed to any radioactivity in the past six months?
Oh, no, of course not. I don't come in contact with anything like that.
- I work in...
- Scott, wait a minute.
That day we were on the boat.
- The boat?
- Charlie's boat. Remember?
Well, yes, I remember.
The mist.
That mist!
You want me to drive, honey?
No, I'm all right.
Louise...
I want you to start thinking about us.
Our marriage.
Some awful things might happen.
There's a limit to your obligation.
Oh now, wait a minute.
Look, I love you. Don't you know that?
You love Scott Carey. He has a size and a shape and a way of thinking.
- All that's changing now.
- Not a darn thing's changed.
When I married you I meant what I said.
And as long as you've got this wedding ring on, you've got me.
Come on now, let's go home.
The truth is,
I just lost the Bannister account.
You know how big that account was.
Probably 40 per cent of my income.
It's gone now and I just can't afford to send you your pay cheques any more.
You've done everything that a brother possibly could do.
Look, I don't like to say this but there have been reporters over at the plant.
Looks like somebody at the medical centre talked about you.
I told them there was nothing in it, but one of the reporters stayed behind.
He was from the
American Press Syndicate.
He said they might pay for the story.
If it's true.
Scott, the story's going to break anyway eventually.
So whether you make them pay or not, they're going to make the most of it.
- So make them pay.
- No, Charlie.
Well, think about it.
All right. I'll think about it.
But really, was there any choice?
We owed a great deal of money and I had no job.
There was no choice. None at all.
And so I became... famous.
And still Robert Scott Carey... known to a nation as The Incredible
Shrinking Man, keeps getting smaller.
How long will this phenomenon continue?
I want to apply for an unlisted line please.
This is a special case.
My name is Louise Carey, my hus...
Carey. C-A-R-E-Y.
Now look, we've got to have an unlisted line. That's all there is to it.
I... I talked to you yesterday.
- Has he come out yet?
- How big is he now?
- Have you seen him?
- He's got to come out sometime.
Are they taking a movie of him?
What's the television truck doing here?
We return you now to Magic Melody.
Yes, thank you very much.
Scott?
Scott? Scott, I've...
- I've cancelled our phone.
- What?
I said, I've cancelled our phone.
They're gonna try to get us an unlisted line sometime next week.
- What do you mean, they're gonna try?
- They're just gonna try.
A lot of people are waiting for unlisted lines.
Didn't you tell them who you're married to?
The incredible Scott Carey, the shrinking freak?
- Stop it.
- Use your influence, Louise.
- I'm a big man! I'm famous!
- Please don't.
Those reporters out there.
Why don't you tell them about it?
Give 'em a new angle for their... for their papers!
Or will I save it for my book?
Yeah, that's what I'll do.
A whole chapter devoted to telephones... and one more joke for the world to laugh at!
Scott, people know. They realise.
They're not laughing at you.
- They're not?
- No.
Why not? It's funny, isn't it?
But it is. See how funny I am?
The child that looks like a man.
Go on, laugh, Louise.
Be like everyone else. It's all right.
Well, why can't you look at me?
Look at me!
Don't, Scott.
Will they just let us alone?
Will they just let us alone?
Lou, es tut mir Leid.
Lou, honey, I'm sorry. I must be losing my mind, talking to you like this.
No, honey. I'm all right.
- I know what you must be suffering.
- Do you?
Yes, I guess it's been a nightmare for you too.
Maybe we've forgotten how to hope.
But, Scott, there's so much to hope for.
Any day now the doctors say they may find the antitoxin.
Sure.
Lou, let's get out of this place before we both go crazy.
Somewhere where nobody can find us.
All right, Scott. I'll...
I'll look for something.
And try... Try not to worry.
No, I'll let the doctors worry.
I'm two days behind on my book.
October 17th.
Height: 36-and-a-half inches.
Weight: 52 pounds.
We haven't been able to find a new house and there still is no privacy... no relief, and no word from the medical centre.
I fear that what life remains to me...
Hello? Yes, this is Carey.
- Louise!
- Yes, Scott?
The antitoxin, they found it.
Oh, Scott. Are you sure?
Dr. Silver wants us down there.
Right away!
There's something you both must understand.
We're working with unknown factors.
Nothing is guaranteed.
We're 50 per cent sure this will be effective.
The other 50 per cent, we'll just have to pray.
How long before we'll know?
Mr. Carey will remain here under observation for a week.
We should have the answer by then.
- Are you ready?
- Ready.
Weight: 52 pounds.
Height: 36-and-a-half inches.
What was last week's reading?
Weight: 52 pounds. Height:
36-and-a-half inches. No change, Doctor.
It's all over, Scott.
You're gonna be all right.
How long will it take, Dr. Silver?
To be normal again?
Put on your robe now.
That'll be all, Miss Maltby.
Mr. Carey, we seem to have checked the degenerative process of your disease.
We've won that much.
At this moment the growth capacity of your body is as limited as any adult's.
Whether or not you grow again is another question.
To help you, we face a whole new set of problems.
Then I'll spend the rest of my life... like this?
Mr. Carey, I assure you, we'll go on working.
Every day we'll push our knowledge further until one day we might have the whole answer.
Thank you, Doctor.
My relationships with the world had ceased with everyone except my wife.
And I knew I was driving Lou from me.
But burning inside, adding its own hideous pressure to everything else... was my desperate need for her.
- You want the paper, Scott?
- No. No thank you.
Well I think I'll turn in.
Come on.
- Coming to bed?
- Yeah, soon.
Well, good night then.
Good night, Louise.
I felt puny and absurd.
A ludicrous midget.
Easy enough to talk of soul and spirit and essential worth.
But not when you're three feet tall.
I loathed myself. Our home, the caricature my life with Lou had become.
I had to get out. I had to get away.
For the first time since it happened,
I ran into the night. Alone.
Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Here it is, folks!
The greatest show in the Midwest!
Come on in and see all the freaks and curiosities!
See Dolly Dumpling, the fat lady!
She weighs 840 pounds!
When she sits down, she shakes and quivers... like a bowl of jelly on a cold and frosty morning!
See Flamo! Flamo, the Fire-eater!
Here is one of the greatest attractions you'll ever see in your born days!
You will remember these sights for the rest of your natural life!
Time for the big show.
I would like you to meet a few of the exhibits here on the platform.
First we have Tiny Tina!
Here she is. 36-and-a-half inches of feminine pulchritude.
You'll see freaks and curiosities assembled from every part of the globe!
The most unusual aberrations assembled under this tent!
Contrived by a tricky Mother Nature!
Here they are in all their glory!
This exhibit is not only entertaining, it's educating...
Hello.
- Mind if I sit down?
- No. Please do.
- Don't be late, Clarice.
- I won't.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Pass me the sugar, huh?
- Oh, sure.
I haven't seen you here before.
You with the carnival?
Oh, no, I... No.
- Just visiting then, huh?
- Yeah.
- I'm Clarice Bruce.
- My name's Scott Carey.
Hi, Scott.
Scott Carey?
I'm sorry, maybe you don't want any company.
No, don't go. I want you to stay.
Talk to me.
- All right.
- How do you live with it, Miss Bruce?
- What do you do?
- I was born a midget.
It's the way I grew up. And now it's happened to you and that's different.
Different? That's another way of saying alone, isn't it?
Oh, but you're not alone now.
Still, it must be hard to forget the way things were.
Yeah, I'd like to burn it out of my mind.
Maybe the best way to begin is to start thinking about the future.
- A future? In a world of giants?
- I've lived with them all my life.
Oh, Scott, for people like you and me the world can be a wonderful place.
The sky is as blue as it is for the giants.
The friends are as warm.
- I wish I could believe that.
- You've got to believe that.
- Don't you?
- Yeah.
Give me time, Clarice. I'll learn.
- Oh! I'll be late for my show!
- Oh, look, can I see you again?
- If you like.
- I would.
You know, Scott?
You're taller than I am.
May I?
Thank you.
That night I got a grip on life again.
I went back to work on my book.
It absorbed me completely.
I was telling the world of my experience.
And with the telling, it became easier.
- I think it's just fine, Scott.
- Do you really think so?
I'm not much of a writer.
Just tryin' to tell what it's like.
You don't know what it's meant to me, meeting you.
- Someone who understands.
- But you're so much better now.
Thanks to you.
Aw, not to me. Yourself.
You just stopped running, that's all.
All I know is I can wake up in the morning and want to live again.
Actually want to live.
It's a funny thing. Sometimes I begin to think it's the world that's changed.
- I'm the normal one
- That sounds like a good thing.
Everybody out of step but you and me.
Come on, I'll buy you a drink.
We can talk about another chapter.
What is it, Scott?
Two weeks ago I was taller than you.
You said so yourself.
- Yes, I remember, but...
- Well can't you see?
- I'm shorter now.
- Oh, Scott.
It's starting again. It's starting.
It's starting again!
Scott?
Scott?
Scott? Are you in there?
Do you have to make such a racket?
- I told you what happens in there!
- I'm sorry, Scott. I try to be careful.
Are you going out?
Yes, for a little while.
- Where?
- Just to the corner. To the store.
- You'll come right back?
- Well of course I will.
Why don't you try to get some rest?
Dr Silver wants to see you tomorrow.
All right, go ahead.
Be sure the doors are locked!
Every day it was worse.
Every day a little smaller.
And every day
I became more tyrannical... more monstrous in my domination of Louise.
Heaven knows how she lived through those weeks.
Only I had the power to release her.
If I could find the courage to end my wretched existence.
But each day I thought,
"perhaps tomorrow".
Tomorrow the doctors will save me.
Scott!
Oh, no.
No...
Oh, Scott...
Scott... drew deafening applause when he announced that if elected... he will do everything in his power to reduce taxes.
From Los Angeles today, a tragic story.
The passing of Robert Scott Carey.
The report of the death of the so-called
"Shrinking Man" comes from his brother.
Carey's death was the result of an attack by a common house cat... a former pet in the Carey home.
He was the victim of the most fantastic ailment in the annals of medicine.
Thus ends the life of a man whose courage and will to survive... lasted until the very end.
A man whose fantastic story... was known to virtually every man, woman and child in the civilised world.
- Mr. Carey?
- Yes?
And now for the sports...
- You may go up. She wants to see you.
- Is she all right?
The doctor gave her a heavy sedative but it's hardly working at all.
- I see.
- I'll get that prescription filled.
- I'll be back in a minute.
- Fine.
My return to consciousness was a plunge into a new level of pain.
I realised I had fallen into a box.
Its walls enclosed me like some gigantic pit.
I had to escape out of the box.
Somehow I had to reach Louise, to survive.
The stairs stretched above me as far as I could see.
Cliff rising upon cliff.
I knew I could never scale them.
Louise!
Louise!
The cellar! Look in the cellar!
Louise! Please look for me! Louise!
Eventually Louise would come to the cellar.
Until then,
I had to keep myself alive... with whatever resources
I could discover in my basement universe.
And in myself.
The cellar floor stretched before me like some vast primeval plain.
Empty of life. Littered with the relics of a vanished race.
No desert island castaway ever faced so bleak a prospect.
I had discovered a water supply, and even a dwelling place.
Now, the search for food.
I knew my ill-fitting clothes were unsuited to the exertions that lay before me.
- You can't stay here, Louise. Not now.
- I... I don't know, Charlie.
- I don't know what I wanna do.
- Lou, let me help you.
You can stay with us, but get out of here.
If I could just be sure.
Charlie, maybe he's hurt someplace.
- Maybe he's lost.
- We've looked everywhere. He's dead.
I'm his own brother. I wouldn't say a thing like that if I wasn't sure.
- You saw the cat.
- All right, all right.
Charlie, have you thought how horrible it must have been?
I just keep thinking that he needed me and I wasn't there.
- I wasn't there.
- Louise.
You've got to get it out of your mind.
I'll never get it out of my mind.
I'll talk to the real estate people.
I never doubted that sometime Louise would come.
I couldn't allow myself to doubt.
I had only to exist.
To search out enough food to sustain me.
I was driven by hunger.
And also by the horrible thought that without nourishment... the shrinking process was quickening.
I was weak and faint.
Yet I knew, in order to exist,
I must eat.
The food was still a long climb ahead of me.
But now, stretching endlessly before me,
I found a deep abyss.
It was only a box and the space between.
Yet to me it was the Grand Canyon and the Mammoth Caves combined.
Deep, dark, mysterious and dangerous.
There was no possible way to cross... no matter how inventive, how resourceful I thought myself.
This time, in sight of my goal, it seemed as if I must meet defeat.
Suddenly I saw an opportunity... if I could move the stick to the other side.
I cursed myself. If only I were a little bigger. A little stronger.
I realised there was just this one chance... and I had no choice, I had to take it.
If I could leap from the paint stick and reach the other side...
But there was no time to think.
Only to act.
MY prison.
Almost as far as I could see, a grave, friendless area of space and time.
And I resolved that as Man had dominated the world of the sun... so I would dominate my world.
In my hunt for food,
I had become the hunted.
This time I survived.
But I was no longer alone in my universe.
I had an enemy.
The most terrifying ever beheld by human eyes.
Charlie, there's a trunk I'd like to take with me if you don't mind.
- It's in the basement. I'll show you.
- I'll put these in the car first.
Oh, all right.
Oh no, it's flooded!
The water heater. I better have a look.
- Oh, this is terrible.
- I'll turn the water off.
Louise! Look for me! Louise! Charlie!
Charlie, I'm here!
Charlie! Louise!
The water! Here in the water! Charlie!
- I smell gas. Is that pilot off?
- I'll turn it off.
Listen to me! Louise!
Louise! Hear me! Please! Please!
- Can you fix it?
- There.
I'll get a plumber down here tomorrow.
Charlie!
- Where's your drain?
- It's there. It must be clogged.
Charlie! Look for me!
- Is that the trunk, Louise?
- Oh, yes, but don't bother about it.
- It's so wet. I'll pick it up later.
- It's okay.
I want you packed and out of this house tonight.
- Is that everything, Louise?
- Yes, that's everything.
I still had my weapons. With these bits of metal I was a man again.
If I was to die, it would not be as a helpless insect... in the jaws of the spider monster.
A strange calm possessed me.
I thought more clearly than I had ever thought before... as if my mind were bathed in a brilliant light.
I recognised that part of my illness was rooted in hunger... and I remembered the food on the shelf.
The cake threaded with spider web.
I no longer felt hatred for the spider.
Like myself, it struggled blindly for the means to live.
If I was to fight it, if I was to win the food... then it must be now while strength remained... while I was still of sufficient size to scale the wall.
It was not decision that drove me to the crate, but reflex... as instinctive as the spider's.
My legs trembled.
Not with fear, but weakness.
Yet somehow I felt within myself a new source of power.
A giant strength, urging me to the death struggle.
My enemy seemed immortal.
More than a spider, it was every unknown terror in the world... every fear fused into one hideous night-black horror.
Still, whatever else had happened, my brain was a man's brain.
My intelligence still a man's intelligence.
An idea came to me. The scissors.
Too heavy for me to employ as a weapon, they might have another use.
If I could impale the monster with my hook... fastened by a line to the scissors, then push the scissors off the ledge.
Whatever the risk, it was worth a try.
I knew, sooner or later, it would come charging down that web... skimming out blackly toward me.
One of us had to die.
Come on down!
Come on, you devil, I'm waiting for you!
Come on!
This was the prize I had won.
I approached it in an ecstasy of elation.
I had conquered.
I lived.
But even as I touched the dry, flaking crumbs of nourishment... it was as if my body had ceased to exist.
There was no hunger.
No longer the terrible fear of shrinking.
Again I had the sensation of instinct.
Of each movement, each thought tuned to some great directing force.
I was continuing to shrink... to become... What?
The infinitesimal?
What was I?
Still a human being?
Or was I the man of the future?
If there were other bursts of radiation... other clouds drifting across seas and continents... would other beings follow me into this vast new world?
So close, the infinitesimal and the infinite.
But suddenly I knew they were really the two ends of the same concept.
The unbelievably small and the unbelievably vast eventually meet... like the closing of a gigantic circle.
I looked up... as if somehow I would grasp the heavens, the universe... worlds beyond number.
God's silver tapestry spread across the night.
And in that moment I knew the answer to the riddle of the infinite.
I had thought in terms of
Man's own limited dimension.
I had presumed upon Nature.
That existence begins and ends is Man's conception, not Nature's.
And I felt my body dwindling... melting, becoming nothing.
My fears melted away and in their place came acceptance.
All this vast majesty of creation, it had to mean something.
And then I meant something too.
Yes, smaller than the smallest,
I meant something too.
To God, there is no zero.
I still exist.
In the final decade of the 21st century...
...men and women in rocket ships landed on the moon.
By 2200 A.D., they had reached the other planets of our solar system.
Almost at once there followed the discovery of hyperdrive...
...through which the speed of light was first attained...
...and later greatly surpassed.
And so at last mankind began the conquest...
...and colonization of deep space.
United Planets Cruiser C-57D...
...now more than a year out from Earth base...
...on a special mission to the planetary system...
...of the great main-sequence star Altair.
- When do we get a D.C. fix, Jerry?
- Half a minute, skipper.
Ship on course, sir.
We'll reach D.C. point at 17:01.
That's less than three minutes now.
- All right. Take it away.
- Aye, aye, sir.
Chief, we'll drop below light speed in about three minutes.
- Got your breakable gear stowed?
- Aye, aye, sir.
All right. Good.
D.C. set and punched on, skipper.
All right, attention.
Captain to crew.
All hands squared away to decelerate.
Ship's beeper will as usual sound 10 times after lights dim.
- Come on, Doc. D.C., Bosun.
- Aye, aye, sir.
D.C. stations. On the double.
Wanna bounce through this one?
All right. We're down to 0.3896 of light speed.
Warm in here, skipper.
Yeah.
Jerry, you--
There's Altair right on the nose, skipper.
Meanwhile this ship arranges its own eclipses.
Okay, Jerry, punch out an orbit on the fourth planet.
Aye, aye, skipper.
Ship in approach, skipper.
Helical vector oriented.
Attention.
Captain to crew, attention.
Our destination, Altair-4, is now visible on the main view plate.
As you recollect from your briefing lectures, this is an Earth-type planet.
Twenty years ago the spacecraft Belerephon landed here...
...with a prospecting party of scientists.
Our mission is to search for survivors.
That is all.
The Lord sure makes some beautiful worlds.
How do these continents check with the old charts?
It'll tell you better in a little while, skipper. Time for brakes.
Okay, take it away.
Astrogator to crew.
Stand by to change flux.
Another one of them new worlds.
No beer, no women, no pool parlors.
Nothing.
Nothing to do but throw rocks at cans, and we gotta bring our own tin cans.
Attention. Captain to crew.
Now, hear this.
We are now entering the atmosphere of Altair-4.
No survival suits will be required upon landing.
Oxygen content: 4.7 richer than Earth standard.
Gravity only 0.897.
Adjust your equipment accordingly.
That is all.
All hands, check equipment.
Let's go.
Not even any short-range radio signals yet?
Not so far, sir.
Jerry, can you make out anything down there?
I may be missing some individual structures...
...but there are no cities, ports, roads, bridges, dams.
There's just no sign of civilization at all.
Sir, we're being radar-scanned.
- Can you zero on it?
- No, sir...
...but it seems to emanate from an area of about 20 miles square.
- Twenty miles square?
- Yes, sir.
- Bosun, flash the alert.
Aye, aye, sir.
Combat stations, blaster men, activate your scopes.
Radio contact, sir.
There's a voice here.
- Human?
- Yes, sir. Sounds like it.
Boost it.
Spaceship, identify yourself. You're being tracked.
Cut me in, Quinn.
United Planets Cruiser C-57D,
J.J. Adams commanding.
- Who are you?
Morbius of the Belerephon.
- Who?
Edward Morbius.
Yeah, here it is.
Morbius, E. Ph.D., Lit.D...
- ...expedition philologist.
- Philologist?
What do you wish here, cruiser?
Well, you don't understand, sir.
We're your relief.
We're very glad to find you alive.
I, of course, appreciate your concern.
But absolutely no assistance of any sort is required.
Oh, the red-carpet treatment, huh?
Dr. Morbius, my orders are to survey the situation on Altair-4.
Let me repeat.
I'm in no sort of difficulty here.
Your best procedure will be to turn back at once without landing.
- Sorry, sir?
- If you set down on this planet...
...I warn you that I cannot be answerable for the safety of your ship or your crew.
If you'll just supply me with landing coordinates.
Dr. Morbius,
I require landing coordinates.
Very well, but I wash my hands of all responsibility.
- You have standard charts?
- Yes, sir.
You may come in at 83-17-4 North...
...148-21 West.
Thank you.
It's right back there in the desert.
Commander,
I strongly urge you to reconsider.
Please permit me to recommend--
Something funny down there, skipper.
Okay, Jerry, I'll take her in.
Aye, sir.
Attention. Captain to crew, stand by to reverse polarity.
Standard class-A security will be maintained upon landing.
And until further notice, all hands will wear side arms.
That is all.
- Artificial gravity off.
- Grav off.
- Half flux.
- Half flux.
- Cut primary coils.
- Primaries cut, sir.
All clear, sir.
Look at the color of that sky.
Yeah, but I'll still take blue.
I don't know.
I think a man could get used to this and grow to love it.
- Bosun.
- Aye, sir.
- You can assemble a tractor.
- Aye, sir.
- Better check the command mike.
- Hm?
The command mike, sir.
Oh, yeah. Good idea. Chief.
Sir?
- You're in command.
- You keep right at those instruments.
Aye, aye, sir.
Hey, what's this dust coming?
Looks like we're being met.
- Bosun.
Aye, aye, sir.
- Hold the tractor.
Aye, aye, sir.
- Quite a vehicle, huh?
- That driver must be a madman.
What driver?
Welcome to Altair-4, gentlemen.
I am to transport you to the residence.
If you do not speak English...
...I am at your disposal with 187 other languages...
...along with their various dialects and sub-tongues.
Colloquial English will do fine, thank you.
This is no offense, but you are a robot, aren't you?
That is correct, sir.
For your convenience, I am monitored to respond to the name "Robby".
Nice climate you have here.
High oxygen content.
I rarely use it myself, sir.
It promotes rust.
Hey, Doc, is it a-- ?
Is it a male or a female?
In my case, sir, the question is totally without meaning.
Will you get in, gentlemen.
Quinn.
Track this if I blink red.
I'll bring the tractor in a hurry.
- Right.
Passengers will please fasten their seat belts.
Looks after us like a mother.
If you gentlemen will go in, you're expected.
- I am Morbius.
- I'm Commander Adams.
This is Lieutenant Farman, my executive...
...and Lieutenant Ostrow, our ship's doctor.
How ironic that a simple scholar with no ambition...
...beyond a modest measure of seclusion should, out of a clear sky...
...find himself besieged by an army of fellow creatures...
...ail grimly determined to be of service to him.
I'm sorry, sir, if we're not welcome, but we do have our orders.
You must stay for lunch, gentlemen.
And do forgive the ill manners of an old recluse. Won't you come in.
Whatever that lunch was, it was certainly delicious.
Simply some of Robby's synthetics.
- He's your cook too?
- Even manufactures the raw materials.
Come round here, Robby.
I'll show you how this works.
Uh, one introduces a sample of human food through this aperture.
Down here there's a small built-in chemical laboratory where he analyzes it.
Later he can reproduce identical molecules in-- In any shape or quantity.
Why, it's a housewife's dream.
Plus absolute, selfless obedience.
Activate the disposal unit.
A household disintegrator beam.
Put your arm in there.
Order canceled.
Don't attribute feelings to him, gentlemen.
Robby is simply a tool.
Tremendously strong, of course.
He could quite easily topple this house off its foundation.
Well, in the wrong hands, mightn't such a tool become a deadly weapon?
No, doctor, not even though I were the mad scientist of the tape thrillers...
...because, you see, there happens to be a built-in safety factor.
Commander, may I borrow that formidable-looking side arm of yours?
Thank you.
Robby, point this thing at that
Althaea frutex out there on the terrace.
Fire.
- Do you understand the mechanism?
Yes, Morbius.
A simple blaster.
All right.
Now, turn around here.
Point it at the commander.
Aim right between the eyes.
Fire.
You see, he's helpless.
Locked in a sub-electronic dilemma between my direct orders...
...and his basic inhibitions against harming rational beings.
Cancel.
If I were to allow that to continue...
...he would blow every circuit in his body.
Doctor, how did you come by such a mechanism?
Uh...
I didn't come by him, doctor,
I tinkered him together...
- ...during my first months up here.
Coffee is ready, sir.
Gentlemen.
Doctor, do you mean that you made this gentleman?
A useful enough toy, lieutenant...
...but nowadays, I have no time for such things.
Dr. Morbius...
...you're a philologist, an expert in words and languages...
...their origins and meanings.
Yet this robot of yours is beyond the combined resources...
...of all Earth's physical science.
My dear commander, maybe you overestimate both Robby and myself.
Gentlemen, let me show you another bit of parlor magic.
Forgive me, I didn't mean to alarm you, gentlemen.
I had Robby install the steel shutters before I realized...
...how altogether safe I am here.
Well, gentlemen, this has been very pleasant.
You've seen how comfortable
I am here, no hardships...
...no special difficulties...
...and no need at all for military assistance.
Now, I dare say you're impatient to get back to base.
Yes, sir, the moment we've interviewed the other members...
...of the Belerephon party.
Others?
But there are no others, commander.
Before the first year was out, they had all, every man and woman...
...succumbed to a--
To a sort of a planetary force here.
Some dark, terrible, incomprehensible force.
Only my wife and I were immune.
And just how do you account for your immunity, Dr. Morbius?
My wife and I differed from the others only in our love for this new world.
In our boundless longing to make a home here...
...far from the scurry and strife of humankind.
I remember how when the vote was taken to return to Earth...
...she and I were utterly heartbroken.
How could we have foreseen the extinction...
...of so many coworkers and friends.
Skipper, there is no record of any wife in the Belerephon rolls.
Oh, Lieutenant, look under biochemistry.
Julia Marsin. She and I were married by the skipper on the voyage here.
I have the certificate.
I thought Robby had managed some very charming feminine touches.
I take it Mrs. Morbius isn't at home today?
My dear wife died a few months after the others.
Only in her case it was of natural causes.
I'm very sorry.
Dr. Morbius, just what were the symptoms of all those other deaths?
- The unnatural ones, I mean.
- The symptoms were striking.
One by one, in spite of every safeguard, my coworkers were torn...
- ...literally limb from limb.
- By what?
By some devilish thing that never showed itself.
- And the Belerephon?
- Vaporized...
...as the three remaining survivors tried to take her off.
And yet in all these 19 years...
...you personally have never again been bothered by this planetary force?
Only in nightmares of those times.
And yet, always in my mind,
I seem to feel the creature...
...is lurking somewhere close at hand.
Sly and irresistible.
And only waiting to be reinvoked for murder.
Father.
Alta.
Alta, I specifically asked you not to join us for lunch.
But, Father, lunch is over.
I'm sure you never said a word about not coming in for coffee.
Well, did you or did you?
Uh, this is Commander Adams...
...Dr. Ostrow and Lieutenant Farman.
- My daughter.
- How do you do?
I've always so terribly wanted to meet a young man and now three at once.
That's very kind of you.
- You're lovely, doctor.
Of course, the two end ones are unbelievable.
Could this end one get you some coffee?
Oh, I'm quite able to get it.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Of course, you must make allowances for my daughter, gentlemen.
She's never known any human being except her father.
I hope you'll make allowances too, sir.
We young men have been shut up in hyperspace for well over a year now...
...and right from here, the view looks just like heaven.
Sugar?
But you keep helping me.
After all, you're not Robby.
I wouldn't mind being Robby in certain ways.
That's only in certain ways, of course.
I can see that was probably very clever, but I don't seem to understand it.
Well, there's...
There's no rush.
Yes, I suppose one day I shall be obliged to make the trip to Earth with her...
...for the sake of her natural development.
I should say fairly soon too.
Your father wasn't too happy at first about your meeting us, was he?
Well, naturally not.
You're from Earth.
- Well, what's wrong with Earth?
- How lucky I am, though.
All three of you are such very fine exceptions.
- Well, you are exceptions, aren't you?
- Oh, sure, sure.
Well, that is, I am anyway.
Old dependable Jerry.
Of course the doc can be trusted too, in the daytime.
What about the commander?
Well, I hate to tell you this, Alta...
...but that man is notorious throughout seven planetary systems.
Oh, dear.
What does he do?
Well, I-- I don't feel free to discuss the shortcomings of a fellow officer...
...but any girl or woman who lets him get her alone, anywhere...
Yes.
Yes, I can see it now. There.
Just then when he looked at me.
Why, his eyes almost had fire in them.
I'm so glad you don't have any fire in your eyes, Lieutenant.
Well, I'm not that harmless.
Alta.
- Yes, Father.
These gentlemen have expressed a very kindly concern...
- ...over the amount of liberty you have.
- Liberty?
I've explained that you have permission to visit Earth whenever you choose.
Earth? I?
Then my little girl never feels lonely or confined?
Why, I don't know.
I have you and Robby and all my friends.
Friends?
Uh, yes.
- Perhaps you better call them, my dear.
- All right.
Come, gentlemen.
Felt something go right through my head.
Uh, Alta's whistle is above the pitch of human hearing.
I often feel it myself.
- What's up?
- Look.
No, no.
No, no, watch.
He's as tame as a kitten.
Outside of the range of my daughter's influence, it's still a deadly wild beast.
Just a routine checkup from the ship.
- Oh.
- What, chief?
Everything okay, commander?
- No problem.
- Would you mind activating the viewer?
Okay.
As you can see, we're under no restraint whatsoever.
Knock that off, Quinn.
If I can be of any help to you in your preparations for the homeward voyage...
Thank you, sir, but unfortunately...
...circumstances may keep us here for a while.
- Circumstances?
- You see, my orders don't quite seem...
...to cover the Belerephon fatalities. I...
I'm forced now to contact base for new instructions.
But, commander, suppose these new instructions...
...require my return to Earth for questioning.
Two years or more away from my work here.
Tell me, just what is involved in your making contact with Earth base?
Well, fundamentally, it's a question of crude power.
How to short-circuit the continuum on a five- or six-parsec level.
Of course, a transmitter of that sort isn't exactly standard equipment.
To build one, we'd have to cannibalize about two-thirds...
...of a ship's electronic gear, and then unship the main drive to juice it.
Just to construct a bunker to house a core would take about 10 days.
Disabled here for 10 days and nights?
Tell me, would 2-inch lead shielding do as well?
It'd be better if we were carrying
100 square yards of the stuff.
I'll have Robby run it off for you...
...and you'll get it not later than tomorrow noon.
That's very obliging of you, sir.
Obliging?
Look out there, commander.
The Belerephon party.
Nineteen years ago I dug those graves with my own hands.
And I have, believe me, no wish to repeat that experience.
Well, we'll see you again soon,
Alta, I hope.
- Thank you, doctor.
- Bye.
Excellent lunch, doctor.
To tell the truth,
I sometimes still miss...
...the conversation of such gentlemen as yourself, doctor.
Well, thank you for your courtesy and concern, sir.
Fasten your seat belts, gentlemen.
Easy with this core. Our M.G. coils won't take us home without it.
Come on, Cookie, get out of the way.
You wanna get run over?
Handle it gently.
It has to get us home.
Hey, you think it's far enough away from the ship?
Sure, no interference there.
What about the magnetic puller?
- Bosun...
- ...just drop the thing down over there.
- Aye, aye, sir.
Where do you wish the shielding stacked, sir?
Well, you can just put it right over there by the core, thank you.
Wait a minute.
That's solid lead he's carrying.
Common lead would have crushed the vehicle, sir.
This is my morning's run of isotope 217.
The whole thing hardly comes to 10 tons.
Hello, Alta.
- Hi.
Does your father know you're here?
He did tell me not to go near the ship.
After all, this isn't very near.
- All right, Cookie, out of here.
- Aye, aye, sir. Yes-- Yes, sir.
Commander! Put me down, sir!
- Commander. Commander.
What is it, chief?
If you'd like to check my assembly...
...for the monitor unit of the klystron transmitter...
What, already?
- Yes, sir.
Excellent.
Aren't-- ? Aren't these condensers out of my accelerator circuits?
Yes, sir. And I borrowed some solenoids from your gyrostabilizers too.
But here's the big deal, sir. I'll bet any quantum mechanic in the service...
...would give his life for a chance to fool around with this.
Better get this in by dark.
Won't do any good...
...to have some fool fall over it before we transmit tomorrow.
- Good work, Quinn.
- Thank you, sir.
Psst.
Come here. Over here.
Can I be of service, sir?
Look, never mind the "sir," mister, but I'm a stranger on this planet.
I was wondering if--
If you could tell me where I could--
A guy could get a hold of some of the real stuff.
- Real stuff?
- For cooking purposes, you understand.
I take a big pride in my duties.
Pardon me, sir. Stuff?
Oh.
Just about one jolt left.
Oh, genuine ancient rocket bourbon.
See here. Hey. Gi--
Why, you low-living contraption.
I ought to take a can opener to you.
Quiet, please.
I am analyzing.
Yes, relatively simple alcohol molecules with traces of fusel oil.
Would 60 gallons be sufficient?
Gallons?
I've been from here to there in this galaxy, and I want you to know...
...you're the most understanding soul
I ever met up with.
Ow.
It's nothing really personal.
It's just a kiss.
Hmm. But why should people wanna kiss each other?
Oh, it's an old custom.
All of the really high civilizations go in for it.
- But it's so silly.
- But it's good for you, though.
It stimulates the whole system.
As a matter of fact, you can't be in tiptop health without it.
Really? I didn't know that.
I'd be only too happy to show you.
Well, thank you very much, lieutenant.
No trouble at all.
Is that all there is to it?
Well, you-- You've sort of got to stick with it.
Oh.
Hmm.
- Just once more. Do you mind?
- Oh, not at all.
There must be something seriously the matter with me...
...because, honestly, I haven't noticed the least bit of stimulation.
Honey, let's do this thing right.
Now, here.
Are you giving me the treatment?
Are you?
- Lieutenant Farman.
- Don't say a word, sir. I--
I know there are a lot of pressing duties waiting for me back at the ship.
And rank does have its little privileges, sir.
And you can depend on it that...
...those privileges won't be stretched into taking your kind of advantages.
- Oh, but I--
- Dismissed.
What's the matter with him?
Why did he leave?
- Why did you both act so funny?
- Well, what do you expect?
Well, don't you understand, Alta?
No? Well, look at yourself.
You can't run around like that in front of men.
Particularly not a space wolf like Farman.
So for Pete's sake go home and put on something that'll...
Anything.
What's wrong with my clothes?
I designed them myself.
Stop looking at me that way.
I don't think I like it.
What do you mean, "Ha, ha"?
We were just trying to get a little healthy stimulation...
...from hugging and kissing, that's all.
Oh, that's all.
It's so easy for you, isn't it?
There's no feelings, no emotions, you...
Nothing human would ever enter your mind.
Well, it so happens that I'm in command of 18 competitively selected...
...super-perfect physical specimens with an average age of 24.6...
...who have been locked up in hyperspace for 378 days.
It would have served you right if I hadn't of-- And-- And he--
Get out of here before I have you run out of the area under guard.
And then I'll put more guards on the guards.
"And then I'll put more guards on the guards."
I don't like him.
I just don't like him.
The way he kept looking at me.
Then he shouted.
- What about?
- I don't know. I don't know, really.
It-- It was awful.
I was only trying to be nice about kissing the lieutenant.
Oh?
- How did the commander react to that?
- Well, he was furious.
He thinks all that about biology had something to do with me.
Personally, I mean.
Never been so nervous in all my life.
And I hope I don't see him again if I live to be 400 million.
Well, I dare say you won't have to.
I think the best thing you can do is go to bed.
I still have some work to do in my study.
- Good night, my dear.
- Good night.
Where have you been?
I've beamed and beamed.
Sorry, miss,
I was giving myself an oil job.
And what is it you require this time, Miss Alta?
Robby, I must have a new dress.
Right away.
- Again?
- Oh, but this one must be different.
Absolutely nothing must show, below, above or through.
- Radiation-proof?
- No, just eye-proof will do.
- Thick and heavy?
- Oh, no. No, Robby.
It must be the loveliest, softest thing you've ever made for me.
And fit in all the right places with lots and lots of star sapphires.
Star sapphires take a week to crystallize properly.
- Would diamonds or emeralds do?
- Well, if they're large enough.
Five, 10, and 15 carats, and on hand.
I will run the dress up for you in time for breakfast.
- Sleep well, miss.
Thank you, Robby.
I don't really care now whether I do or not.
Funny to see two moons in the sky, isn't it?
Funny how quick a guy gets used to it.
Yeah.
- Joe.
- What?
- Do you hear something?
- Like what?
Like a sort of big breathing.
No.
That's funny, I did.
Strong and Grey, last night, during your watch...
...this ship was entered and valuable government property was sabotaged.
Now, the two of you claim to have been at your posts and awake.
Yet the ship was entered, the heavy-duty hatch was raised and latched back.
And neither of you saw or heard anything.
Except you, Grey.
You heard breathing.
And Youngerford, let me see, you were asleep in your bunk...
...and you think you had a dream.
A dream.
Pending evidence, you're deprived of space pay and privileges.
Oh, me too, sir?
No, "me too, sir," will stand
20 extra watches.
I'll have less dreaming aboard this ship.
Dismissed.
Skipper.
- Come on. Well, Quinn?
Half of this gear we can replace out of stores.
The rest we can patch up one way or another.
Except this special klystron frequency modulator.
Now, with every facility of the ship,
I think I might be able to rebuild it.
But frankly, the book says no.
It came packed in liquid boron in a suspended gravity.
All right, so it's impossible.
How long will it take?
Well, if I don't stop for breakfast...
- All right, get on it, Quinn.
- Thank you, sir.
- Tractor's ready.
- Thank you.
- A minute, skipper, I'll change uniform.
- Stay as you are.
- I'm leaving you in command here.
- Oh, I see.
Establish a perimeter.
Set up a class-A alert.
- I want them in force by sundown.
- Aye, aye, sir.
Good morning, gentlemen.
We'd like to see Dr. Morbius.
Morbius is in his study, sir.
Never to be disturbed while that door is closed.
All right, we'll wait.
Is there any other way out of there?
This is the only door.
In case you require anything, gentlemen, use the beamer.
How could he have slipped past two sentries?
Nothing important, skipper.
Doc, you stay right there where you are and keep your eye on that door.
Okay, skipper, and if Morbius comes out, we'll call you from right here.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
Come on in.
Didn't bring my bathing suit.
What's a bathing suit?
Oh, murder.
Never mind. I'm coming out.
Now, Alta, listen, you mustn't--
You just wait right there.
It'll only take me a second to get dry.
Yes. Well, I'll...
I'll just turn my back here.
Well, if that's the way you feel about it.
Well, don't worry, you're not gonna have to look at me anymore from now on.
Hm?
You'll see.
- See what?
- You'll see what.
Now, wait-- Now, wait a minute, Alta.
Now, if you're planning on...
I didn't expect to see you today after the way you spoke to me yesterday.
Oh.
I'm-- I'm very sorry about the way
I spoke to you yesterday, Alta.
I-- I was sort of bothered.
Mm.
All right, you can look now.
Nothing shows through, does it?
Uh-uh.
I had it made especially for you.
Oh, I thought you weren't expecting me today.
I wasn't.
I don't know, I guess there's something about me personally you don't like.
Alta...
...you will always look just beautiful.
Then why don't you kiss me like everybody else does?
Everybody?
Hasn't your father taught you anything at all?
Well, he says I'm terribly ignorant, but I have had poetry...
...mathematics, logic, physics, geology and bi--
-- ology?
Of course, that's-- That's mostly on the theoretical side?
Well, so far.
Oh?
Well, what's wrong with theory?
This.
- Alta.
- It's all right, he's my friend.
I'm-- I'm sorry, Alta.
I-- I had to do that.
But he didn't recognize me.
He would have killed me. Why?
You really don't know, do you?
No, I don't.
Is he still in there?
Hasn't come out.
Now, wait a minute, skipper.
After all, it is his house.
What's the matter?
Doc, something new has been added.
Oh.
That's gonna complicate things a bit.
Yeah.
Not even a window.
The robot lied.
Morbius hasn't been in here.
Doc, he's up to something.
Look at this, skipper.
- Hieroglyphics?
- Maybe.
But it doesn't look like Egyptian, cuneiform or Chinese.
You'll find the household silver in the dining room...
...and my daughter's jewelry on her dressing table.
Dr. Morbius...
...last night our klystron monitor was sabotaged.
And you suspect me?
Then the time has come for clarification.
Sit down.
In times long past...
...this planet was the home of a mighty and noble race of beings...
...which called themselves the Krell.
Ethically, as well as technologically...
...they were a million years ahead of humankind...
...for in unlocking the mysteries of nature...
...they had conquered even their baser selves.
And when, in the course of eons, they had abolished sickness...
...and insanity and crime and ail injustice...
...they turned, still with high benevolence, outward toward space.
Long before the dawn of man's history, they had walked our Earth...
...and brought back many biological specimens.
I see, that explains the tiger and the deer.
The heights they had reached.
But then, seemingly on the threshold of some supreme accomplishment...
...which was to have crowned their entire history...
...this all but divine race perished in a single night.
In the 2000 centuries since that unexplained catastrophe...
...even their cloud-piercing towers of-- Of glass...
...and porcelain and adamantine steel...
...have crumbled back into the soil of Altair-4, and nothing...
...absolutely nothing, remains above ground.
What were they like?
No record of their physical nature has survived.
Except, perhaps, in the form of this characteristic arch.
I suggest you consider it in comparison...
...to one of our functionally-designed human doorways.
That recording was made by Krell musicians...
...a half a million years ago.
Now, if you will follow me...
...I will show you some of their other remaining artifacts.
Krell metal.
Try your blaster there, commander.
This spot should be molten.
It's not even warm, huh?
And no trace of radioactivity.
The molecules are many times more densely interlocked than in earthly steel.
Yet it drinks up energy like a sponge.
This is just one of their laboratories.
You will notice that much of the equipment is familiar...
...though designed for non-human technicians.
What's this?
On this screen may be projected the total scientific knowledge of the Krell...
...from its primitive beginning to the day of its annihilation.
A sheer bulk surpassing many million earthly libraries.
- You're able to read this?
- A Little. It's my profession.
Twenty years ago I began here with this page of geometrical theorems.
Eventually, I was able to deduce most of their huge logical alphabet.
I began to learn.
The first practical result was that robot of mine...
...which you gentlemen appear to find so remarkable.
Child's play.
I've come here every day now for two decades...
...painfully picking up a few of the least difficult fragments of their knowledge.
A thing like this, it's--
It's too big to evaluate.
- Think what a discovery of this kind--
- Dr. Morbius...
...what is this device over here?
I call it their plastic educator.
As far as I can make out, they used it to condition and test their young...
...in much the same way as we employed finger-painting among our children.
I often play with it myself for relaxation.
Although working here,
I sometimes wish I'd been blessed...
...with multiple arms and legs.
Now, you can see that this headset was designed...
...for something much bulkier than my human cranium.
Now, over here you see the electromagnetic waves of my brain...
...sending that indicator up about halfway.
I gather that one of their own young...
...comparable to a seven-year-old child, was normally expected...
...to send that all the way to the top...
...which by Krell standards classifies me as a low-grade moron.
Yet I have an officially recorded IQ of 183.
Now then, for the primary function.
Actually, to operate...
Well, I'll choose a familiar subject to start with to save time.
There now, gentlemen.
What's that?
What's happening there?
A statue.
That's Altaira.
Simply a three-dimensional image, commander.
But it's alive.
Because my daughter is alive in my brain from microsecond to microsecond...
...while I manipulate.
There.
Something of a strain.
Aladdin's lamp in a physics laboratory.
Would you care to take the Krell test of your intelligence?
- Yes, very much.
- You may be disappointed, commander.
Suppose we start with the good doctor.
- What do I do?
- Just sit down there, and I'll...
Move a little forward. That's it.
There now.
Now, doctor, you can read it here.
Well, there's something wrong here.
I have an IQ of 161...
...yet I don't register a third what you did.
Mm. Now the commander.
It's all right, sir. A commanding officer doesn't need brains.
- Just a good loud voice, huh?
- How do I make an image?
- Do I just pull this switch?
- Don't. Stop.
You'd never survive.
Our Belerephon skipper tried it...
...and it was instantly fatal to him.
Oh, I see.
So you're immune to this too?
In my first attempt at creating an image here...
...my brain pattern there was scarcely any larger than yours.
Afterwards, I lay unconscious for a day and a night.
And yet you came back for a second go at it.
It was a question of science, doctor.
But you can imagine my joy when I discovered that the shock...
...had permanently-- Permanently doubled my intellectual capacity.
Otherwise, my researches here would've come to nothing...
...poor as they have been.
Recently, I have turned up some rather puzzling indications...
...that in those final days before their annihilation...
...the Krell had been applying their entire racial energies to a new project.
One which they actually seemed to hope...
...might somehow free them once and for all...
...from any dependence on physical instrumentalities.
- A civilization without instrumentalities?
- Incredible.
Dr. Morbius, everything here is new.
Not a sign of age or wear on any of it.
Young man, these devices, self-serviced, self-maintained...
...have stood exactly as you see them for 2000 centuries.
Two thousand centuries.
And during all this time, what was the power source?
That's a very good question.
May I draw your attention to these gauges all around here, gentlemen.
Their calibrations appear to indicate that they are set in decimal series.
Each division recording exactly 10 times...
...as many amperes as the one preceding it.
Ten times 10, times 10, times 10, times 10, times 10...
...on and on and on, row after row, gauge after gauge.
But there is no direct wiring that I can discover.
However, when I activate this machine, it registers infinitesimally...
...you see, down there in the lower left-hand corner.
And then...
...when I activate the educator here...
...it registers a little more.
But this much is negligible.
Why, the total potential here must be nothing less than astronomical.
Nothing less. The number 10...
...raised almost literally to the power of infinity.
Gentlemen, would you care to see some more of the Krell wonders?
- Indeed, yes.
- Yes.
If you will step in this shuttle-car.
How often the Krell technicians have ridden in this little vehicle.
What now, Dr. Morbius?
Prepare your minds for a new scale...
...of physical scientific values, gentlemen.
Twenty miles.
Listen.
- Circuits opening and closing.
- And they never rest.
This is one of their ventilator shafts.
You can feel the warm air rising.
Look down here.
Look down, gentlemen.
Are you afraid?
Seventy-eight hundred levels...
...and 400 other shafts like this one.
Yes, a single machine.
A cube 20 miles on each side.
For 2000 centuries it has waited patiently here...
...tuning and lubricating itself, replacing worn parts.
I have reason to believe that 16 years ago...
...a minor alteration was performed...
...throughout the entire
8000 cubic miles of its own fabric.
But what's it all for?
Uh, sometimes the gauges register a little...
...when the buck deer fight in autumn or when the birds fly over in the spring.
Nearly a whole dial became active...
...when your ship first approached from deep space.
I'll show you a section of one of the power units.
These units are sunk in the body of the planet...
...50 miles right below our feet.
Now, be sure and look only in the mirror.
Man does not behold the face of the Gorgon and live.
Ninety-two hundred thermonuclear reactors in tandem.
The harnessed power of an exploding planetary system.
All hands, stand clear of fence area.
All right, Quinn, turn it up.
- Have you tested it yet, Bosun?
- Right away, sir.
- There you are, sir.
- Very good.
Lieutenant, having completed my washing-up duties after chow...
...I request the lieutenant's permission to take a walk outside the perimeter, sir.
- There's nothing out there.
- But there is, sir. I mean...
...I thought it might brighten the boys' mess a bit...
...you know, if I-- If I could find a few wild radishes or something.
I don't know what you're lying about, but get back...
...before the skipper checks in or we'll be skinned.
- Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Thank you.
- Quinn, this is Farman.
Kill the power on the fence.
All right, put it back on.
Four hundred and eighty pints.
As you requested.
Total, 60 gallons.
Genuine Kansas City bourbon.
It's smooth too.
Robby, I ain't never gonna forget this.
Anytime you're hard up for a couple of gallons of lube oil, you just let me know.
What's up?
Somebody coming this way?
No, sir, nothing coming this way.
Lieutenant, the fence is shorting.
- Shall I shut down the current, sir?
- No. No, it's stopped now.
Check the system first thing in the morning.
Aye, sir.
It's strange how that fence just shorted out.
Yeah.
You're too arbitrary, commander.
Perhaps I do not choose to be dictated to in my own world.
Dr. Morbius, a scientific find of this magnitude...
...has got to be under
United Planet supervision.
- No one man should monopolize it.
- For the past two hours...
...I've been expecting you to make exactly that asinine statement.
Just one moment, commander.
For close on 20 years now
I've been constantly...
...and I hope dispassionately, considering this very problem.
And I have come to the unalterable conclusion that man is unfit, as yet...
...to receive such knowledge, such almost limitless power.
Whereas Morbius, with his artificially expanded intellect...
...is now ideally suited to administer this power for the whole human race.
Precisely, doctor.
Such portions of the Krell science, as I may from time to time...
...deem suitable and safe,
I shall dispense to Earth.
Other portions I shall withhold.
And in this I shall be answerable exclusively...
...to my own conscience and judgment.
Dr. Morbius, in the absence of special instructions...
...you leave me in a very awkward position. I--
Commander.
Speaking, lieutenant.
Skipper, the chief's been murdered.
Quinn, murdered?
He was alone, working on the monitor.
The rest of us were all outside on guard duty. I--
- How was it done?
- Done?
Skipper, his body is plastered all over the communications room.
All right, leave everything as it is.
We're on our way.
It's started again.
Is that it?
I tried to make this plaster model from the footprints we found.
Thirty-seven inches by 19.
Why, it's fantastic.
Doc, I don't understand.
Whatever walks on this would be an opponent for a man with a club...
...but with our weapons,
Quinn could've--
No, skipper. This thing runs counter to every known law of adaptive evolution.
What do you mean?
Well, notice this structure here.
Characteristic of a four-footed animal.
Yet our visitor last night left the tracks of a biped.
Primarily a ground animal too.
Yet this claw could only belong to an arboreal creature...
...like some impossible tree sloth.
It just doesn't fit into normal nature anywhere in the galaxy. It's a nightmare.
Is that what you made out of that footprint?
I think it's fairly close.
Pardon me, commander, are you ready to hold discipline on the cook, sir?
Yeah, let's-- Let's have him.
I'm obliged to remind you, sir, that I gave him permission to go out last night.
Did you give him permission to get drunk?
Drunk, sir? Me, sir?
Well, ask Dr. Ostrow, sir.
Four pints of 120-proof bourbon without a trace of hangover.
Now, that ain't natural, sir.
Besides, why did that robot argue me into drinking...
...ail that whiskey in the first place?
- You were with the robot last night?
- Yes, sir.
Him and me, we kind of got to toasting each other's good health.
Just for cordial interplanetary relations, you understand.
And that's all the time?
Even while the chief was being killed?
Well, certainly, sir.
I hope you don't think I could have got that stiff in five minutes.
All right, dismissed.
- Well, I guess that washes the robot up.
- Where does that leave us for suspects?
Maybe it leaves us with the same one.
Maybe we ought to drop over to that lab...
...and get our IQ's boosted a couple 100 percent.
- Sir, the burial detail is ready.
- Oh.
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.
- All right, dismissed.
Company dismissed.
Fine technician.
A good shipmate.
And that's a good epitaph for any man.
Good day, Dr. Morbius.
I dare say neither of us slept any last night.
That's a pretty close guess.
I warned you while your ship was still in space.
I begged you not to land on this planet.
Believe me, commander, that is only a foretaste.
The Belerephon pattern is being woven again.
Remain here, and the next attack on your party...
...will be more deadly and general.
How do you know that?
Know? I...
I seem to visualize it.
I...
If you wish, call it a...
A premonition.
What do you make of that, skipper?
I'd say it sounded like an ultimatum.
- Bosun.
- Aye, sir.
- Bosun.
- Aye, aye, sir.
- I want a clear field of fire.
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Randall.
Sir?
How soon will radar be operational?
Operating right now.
- Good. You keep right on it yourself.
Aye, aye, sir.
- The M.A. alert is completed?
- Aye, aye, sir.
Fine.
Activate main batteries.
Alarm for test.
Fire.
Check, good.
Oh, Lieutenant, you got your trouble squad in hand?
Yes, sir, they're in hand, but they're trigger-happy.
They're sort of edgy to see whatever's out there.
Oh, Jerry.
Look, this may be a big deal coming up.
I'm sorry if I've leaned on you.
- You've got to understand--
- Stop knocking yourself out, skipper.
- She picked the right man.
- Oh.
What is it?
Radar picked up something.
- Where?
- At the head of the arroyo.
- Moving?
- This way, sir. Slowly.
Automatic control.
Batteries, fire.
Batteries, hold fire.
- Can you see anything out there, Doc?
- Nothing.
Batteries, fire.
Batteries, cease fire.
- Randall.
Dead on target, sir.
- Good. Give me audio-com.
- Aye, aye, sir.
Your attention.
This may be a ruse to divert us...
...from some other part of the perimeter.
You men will continue watching on your own immediate fronts. That is all.
What?
It stopped at the foot of the pass.
- You sure you got a real blip there?
Big as a house, sir.
We were dead on target with both bursts.
It's coming on again.
- Straight across?
- It shows here.
It's still coming.
Grey, Strong, set up a crossfire on those rocks.
Fire!
Skipper, the blasted thing's invisible.
Jerry!
Fire!
Father!
- Alta.
- Father!
- Altaira.
- Alta. Alta, where are you?
- Father.
- What is it? What's the matter?
- I just had a terrible dream.
There was blood and fire and thunder...
...and something awful was moving in the middle of it.
I could hear the roar and bellow.
Now, now, now, you know a dream can't hurt you.
Not me. Not us.
The thing I saw was trying to break into camp. It was gonna kill--
You'll take care of him for me, won't you, Father? You'll protect him.
My darling,
I'm completely helpless...
...as long as he remains here so willfully.
Come now. Come.
Bosun.
Yes, sir.
- Get those graves dug. Keep busy.
- Right. The busier the better.
Randall, give me audio-com.
Well, men, whatever it was, our main battery stopped it.
You believe that?
No, it just went away for some reason. It'll be back.
Doc, an invisible being that cannot be disintegrated by atomic fission.
No, skipper, that is a scientific impossibility.
Hypnotic illusions don't tear people apart.
That's true enough, but any organism...
...dense enough to survive three billion electron volts...
...would have to be made of solid nuclear material.
It would sink to the center of this planet.
Well, you saw it yourself, standing in those neutron beams.
And there's your answer.
It must've been renewing its molecular structure...
...from one microsecond to the next.
- Bosun.
Aye, sir.
- I want the tractor.
Ready, sir.
We pick up the girl and her father whether they like it or not?
Section 86A, evacuate all civilians from disaster area.
You Left out two very important words:
"Where feasible."
Now, if you'll remember the Belerephon expedition...
...their ship was vaporized trying to lift off.
Which makes it a gilt-edged priority that one of us...
...gets into that Krell lab and takes that brain boost.
- Bosun.
Aye, sir.
I'm leaving you in command.
Get the ship operational.
Do your best to wait it out for me and the doctor.
But the second that fence shorts again, you Lift off...
...and report back to Earth base on conditions in this sector.
Right, skipper.
All right, get everything aboard ship.
We're pulling out.
No lights showing.
Yeah.
Look, Doc, in case we make it into that lab...
...I'll take the first go at the IQ booster.
- You hear me?
- I hear you.
I am monitored to admit no one at this hour.
Well, that sounded final.
Maybe if we reasoned with him.
My beams are focused on your blasters, gentlemen.
Hasn't he got a built-in rule against wringing our Little necks for us?
That is true, sir.
Yet I am monitored to admit no one.
Robby, Let them in.
Alta, this is your father's order.
- Now, get out of the way.
- Quiet.
Robby, emergency cancellation
Archimedes.
Why are you here?
We were attacked. Three more men dead, including Jerry Farman.
I don't know...
...it was just some kind of big outline in the disintegrator beams.
- And you can't explain it?
- No.
Well, anyway, we fought it, and we lost.
- I figure it'll be back.
- Then you must leave now.
I'm not going without you.
But I can't possibly leave him alone,
I just can't.
- Then we'll take him.
- By force? I can't agree to that either.
Can't you? You don't realize what's loose on this planet.
But I'm immune, like both my parents.
I don't believe it.
Nothing could be immune to that.
Oh, darling, darling, please go.
- Please, please, if you love me, go.
- Alta.
Doc, will you talk some sense to this girl?
I'm in over my head.
Doc?
Doc.
On the sofa, Robby.
So you took the brain boost, huh?
You ought to see my new mind...
...up there in lights.
Bigger than his now.
Now, easy, Doc.
Morbius was too close to the problem.
The Krell had completed their project.
The big machine...
...no instrumentalities...
...true creation.
Come on, Doc, let's have it.
- But the Krell forgot one thing.
- Yes, what?
Monsters, John.
Monsters from the id.
The id? What's that?
Talk, Doc.
Doc.
Oh, Doc.
Doc.
How romantic.
The fool. The meddling idiot.
As though his ape's brain could contain the secrets of the Krell.
Father, he's dead.
He was warned, and now he's paid.
Let him be buried with the other victims of human greed and folly.
Morbius...
...you wanted me to make a choice.
Now you've chosen for me.
- Alta.
- I'm ready to go with you, darling.
Altaira. No.
I will place him in the tractor.
- Thank you.
She mustn't do this.
She must be prevented.
Morbius, what is the id?
Young man, my daughter is planning a foolish action, and she'll be punished.
- What is the id?
- Id, id, id.
It's a...
It's an obsolete term...
...I'm afraid, once used to describe...
...the elementary basis of the subconscious mind.
- Monsters from the id.
- Huh?
Monsters from the subconscious.
Of course, that's what Doc meant.
Morbius, the big machine,
8000 cubic miles of klystron relays.
Enough power for a whole population of creative geniuses.
Operated by remote control.
Morbius, operated by the electromagnetic impulses...
- ...of individual Krell brains.
- To what purpose?
In return, that machine would instantaneously project solid matter...
...to any point on the planet. In any shape or color they might imagine.
For any purpose, Morbius.
Creation by mere thought.
Why haven't I seen this all along?
But like you, the Krell forgot one deadly danger...
...their own subconscious hate and lust for destruction.
The beast.
The mindless primitive.
Even the Krell must have evolved from that beginning.
And so those mindless beasts of the subconscious had access...
...to a machine that could never be shut down.
The secret devil of every soul on the planet...
...ail set free at once to loot and maim...
...and take revenge, Morbius, and kill.
My poor Krell.
After a million years of shining sanity...
...they could hardly have understood what power was destroying them.
Yes, young man...
...ail very convincing, but for one obvious fallacy.
The last Krell died
2000 centuries ago...
...but today, as we all know...
...there is still at large on this planet, a living monster.
Your mind refuses to face the conclusion.
What do you mean?
Morbius.
- Morbius.
- What?
Something is approaching from the southwest.
It is now quite close.
- Could Robby be wrong?
- No, never.
There it comes.
I feel sorry for you, young man.
Feel sorry for your daughter, Morbius.
It's listening.
Alta, go into my study.
- You still refuse to face the truth.
- What truth?
Morbius, that thing out there...
- ...it's you.
- You're insane.
How else would you have led it here where Alta must see you torn to pieces?
Still think she's immune?
She's joined herself to me.
- Yes, and whatever comes, forever.
- Say it's a lie.
Let it hear you.
Tell it you don't love this man.
Not even if I could.
Stop it, Robby. Don't let it in.
Kill it, Robby.
It's no use.
He knows it's your other self.
We're safe.
Why did you jumble that combination?
Whatever you know in here, your twin self out in the tunnel knows too.
I'm not a monster, you--
We're all part monsters in our subconscious...
- ...so we have laws and religion.
- Let me go.
You've got to listen.
We don't have much time.
Here. Here's where your mind was artificially enlarged.
Consciously it lacked the power to operate the great machine...
...but your subconscious had been made strong enough.
- I won't hear you.
- You've got to listen.
Twenty years ago when your comrades voted to return to Earth...
...you sent your secret id out to murder them.
Not quite realizing it, of course...
...except maybe in your dreams.
What man can remember his own dreams?
At least when our ship was approaching, you remembered enough to warn us off.
But then when you thought we were threatening your egomaniac empire...
...your subconscious sent its id monster out again.
More deaths, Morbius.
More murder.
And now this too.
Harm my own daughter?
But now she's defying you, Morbius...
...and even in you, the loving father, there still exists the mindless primitive...
...more enraged and more inflamed with each new frustration.
So now you're whistling up your monster again...
...to punish her for her disloyalty and disobedience.
And if you don't do something about it soon, Morbius...
...it's going to be coming right through that door.
Solid Krell metal,
26 inches thick.
Look at your gauges. Look.
That machine is going to supply your monster...
...with whatever amount of power it requires to reach us.
Look now.
Red-hot. Soon it'll be white-hot...
...then it'll soften and melt.
Alta, say you don't believe this of me.
Tell me you don't.
Then it must be true.
Yes, I must be guilty.
Then help us, darling.
I've known you. I've known you great and noble Like the Krell.
Guilty. Guilty.
My evil self is at that door, and I have no power to stop it.
Stop. No further.
I deny you, I give you up.
Father. Oh, Father.
Son...
...turn that disc.
The switch, throw it.
In 24 hours...
...you must be
100 million miles out in space.
The Krell furnaces, chain reaction...
...they cannot be reversed.
Alta...
Oh, no.
Ninety-eight million point six.
We're clear now.
What an astrogator.
A genuine privilege, commander.
Activate main view plate.
Aye, aye, skipper.
That's Altair-4, the bright speck below the star.
Fifteen seconds.
Yes, Alta, your father, my shipmates...
...ail the stored knowledge of the Krell.
Five seconds, four, three...
...two, one.
Alta, about a million years from now...
...the human race will have crawled up to where...
...the Krell stood in their great moment of triumph and tragedy...
...and your father's name will shine again...
...like a beacon in the galaxy.
It's true...
...it will remind us that we are, after all, not God.
On tests in Northern Australia,
a prototype of the nuclear motor designed to power the Quatermass II rocket
has gone into a runaway reaction,
ending in a disastrous explosion.
In the rocket research station in England, its twin reveals the same latent faults.
Professor Bernard Quatermass and his staff, now including Doctor Leo Pugh
and his own daughter Paula,
realise that the extensive project to colonise the Moon may have to be abandoned.
Then an interruption. Captain John Dillon has tracked falling meteorites by radar
and, against orders, has managed to recover one.
Reassembled, the object proves to have been hollow. Visiting the scene of the incidents,
Quatermass and Dillon come upon a closed area and a vast government plant
that is said to be heavily guarded.
Its appearance disturbs them.
Then, as they venture closer to the place, another meteorite falls.
They are able to locate it, still in one piece.
Can you smell it? Ammonia.
Dillon! There's something on your face!
Dillon!
It's gone, but there was something, I swear.
Are you all right?
All right? Don't know.
Uh... don't know.
Whatever else came out of that, there was certainly ammonia. You got a lungful.
Take some deep breaths. Try!
Similar to the first one.
Hollowed in the same way.
Thistledown.
What I saw...
What I thought I saw was transparent.
Just for a moment it shone and then...
Is your face still sore? Let me see. Look up.
Look to the light.
Yes, there is something there.
A kind of... Just on the hairline.
A discoloured indentation.
Don't touch!
Keep back!
Tell them. Tell.
All right, Dillon. If you won't start talking, I will.
Take a look at this.
Be careful - it needs expert examination.
It's some sort of meteorite.
We saw it fall and came to examine it.
- Who are you?
- That doesn't matter.
- You are in a restricted area.
- Let me talk to somebody in authority in there.
- I'll explain when we get there.
- Explain.
It was intact when it fell.
That's almost unknown for a meteorite.
It broke up as we looked at it.
This man was affected. Something came from it.
Gas, at any rate. Is this a military establishment?
Get those pieces.
No! Don't you realise the importance of observations?
- Take him.
- Wait a minute.
- He will be given treatment.
- There?
- He must come.
- Are you arresting him?
- He must.
- Yes...
- I'm sorry, Dillon. I'll explain.
- You will go. Now. While you can.
- But I will tell them that I am responsible.
- Do not try. Go.
Dillon, I'm sorry I got you into this mess.
I'll find some way.
No, don't follow. Don't try to follow!
- Dillon!
- Go now. Go.
Psst!
Hi there.
- Who are you?
- I got no business here, same as you.
Have they gone?
Yes.
Lucky they didn't pinch you, too.
You were watching?
- Through there.
- Did you see that thing fall?
- What thing?
- That... that stone.
Stone? Nah. I was asleep until all the whistles and shouting.
I come here last night, after dark.
Woke up and seen all them fellas around with guns all over the place.
So I lay low all day.
- Soon be dark again.
- Why are you here?
Got a gasper?
I reckon to pass by this way once a year.
- There used to be a village here.
- Yes.
Winnerden Flats. Ta.
I heard tales of this coming along the road, but I didn't believe it.
They must have smashed the whole place flat with them bulldozers.
Why?
There was nice people about here.
Open-handed.
When you were here a year ago, the place was normal?
Thriving.
Woman gave me a brace of chickens.
Give 'em to me.
But there was a government research unit?
Only a few little huts. I didn't mind them.
They didn't bother me very much.
A bit different from that.
It's not finished yet.
All day long, banging and riveting.
And the men they've got working in there.
Thousands of them.
Like an army.
I've seen 'em come, I've seen 'em go.
In big lorries.
- Where? Do you know?
- Look...
- On the horizon?
- A whole town. New-built.
I come through there.
No good. Not all these prefab estates.
They've got no time for trampers.
"Dig the garden and I'll give you your dinner."
"I'm going on," I said.
Somewhere I can get proper treatment.
Winnerden Flats.
What have you got there? A flint?
Plenty of them about.
- Too many.
- It's not a flint.
- Of course it is.
- It's worn and weathered by long exposure.
What else could it be?
Look, they're all over the place.
You're a funny fella with stones, aren't you?
What do you do? Collect them?
You'll bust your pockets.
You'd better get going.
How far to that prefab town?
- Turn north by the sea, then about five miles.
- Thanks.
Here. Don't hang around.
Gone down to the boozer for a quick one,
I suppose.
Yes. Yeah, keep an eye out for him.
And chase the mother up here, will you?
Tell them...
Tell them she's been wandering again.
Yes. Yes, thanks, Bob.
I was right. Why these people can't look after their kiddies, I don't know.
- Hello. What can I do for you?
- Are there any police in this town?
- Police?
- There are none?
Well, we're the police. The Camp Committee.
- What if you can't handle something?
- Doesn't often happen.
- With construction teams and labour gangs?
- Look, mister, if we need police assistance, we get it from outside. Now, what's your business?
I'm worried about a friend of mine.
We were near that plant where your men work.
- He was taken ill, the guards took him away.
- It's a prohibited area. You must have known.
This is a free country in time of peace.
I have rights and will use them.
Right. You've used them.
Happy?
What are you supposed to represent?
A publicly appointed committee?
We represent the workers on that project.
We're doing all right.
A lot more than all right.
We're asked to co-operate by keeping our mouths shut. Just like in the war.
- We try to do our best.
- You succeed!
We don't like people who make it difficult.
I have trodden where some bureaucrat didn't wish me to tread, but does that put me beyond your aid?
Look, mister, your friend will have been taken to the infirmary.
He wouldn't have come to any harm.
Let's check that, shall we?
- Shall I ring?
- Telephone the police.
I'll make a full statement of what happened.
What are you grinning at?
- You said you call in police help sometimes.
- Yes. Their police.
Those guards. It's a security arrangement.
Shall I ring?
Now, look, don't worry about your friend.
- They'll take him to another hospital.
- I'll ring the county constabulary.
No!
Honestly, they wouldn't deal.
Wouldn't deal? What IS this place?
Oh, really, mister. Can't you read?
Excuse me... Oh, there she is. Poor little love.
Mr Dawson, I'm ever so sorry about this, about all the trouble you've had.
I've told her a hundred times, but it makes no difference.
- Where was she?
- Heading up there. Bob Rigby found her.
- You naughty girl.
- There'll be trouble.
- I know, I know!
- No one's allowed there.
Yes, Mr Dawson. I don't like to blame her.
Since she was sick, she's not been the same.
- Sick?
- Are you still here?
- Tell me about it. When did it happen?
- A few months ago, just after we moved here.
She was out playing somewhere and was taken queer.
She seemed to get over it, but since then... she wanders.
- Where to?
- Only up there to the place. Eh, Mr Dawson?
Did you ever see anything like this?
Did you find something once?
When you were playing?
That broke into pieces like this?
And then you were sick?
And then there was this mark?
I seen it a long time ago.
It's never given any trouble.
Are you making out I neglect her?
- Was anybody else sick?
- Nobody! Is he some sort of inspector?
No. I'm putting a stop to this. A little while ago,
I asked you to leave. Now I'm not asking.
- Don't be a fool, man.
- Fool?!
I think there's something wrong. Danger.
Tell me!
- Tell you what?
- Oh, I don't know the full facts.
- What is this place? What's being made there?
- You're mad.
For heaven's sake, forget these posters for just five seconds!
Get on your way.
You want to meet those guards again?
I'll give you a count of three.
- That got rid of him.
- Well! You were right. He must've been mad.
The things he was saying. Why...
This isn't nothing.
Look, Mr Dawson. Is it, now?
- Dr Pugh?
- Yes?
- Ready for the test.
- Oh, good.
Mm, not a bad section.
It's difficult to find a decent one from one of these fragments.
That's a trace of metallic mineral, isn't it? There.
Yes. Let's see.
If that etches into the standard pattern, this must be a normal meteorite.
- Yes.
- Leo, am I interrupting something?
Oh, not at all.
- Is your father back?
- Not yet.
- What are you looking for?
- An etched pattern. A Widmanstatten shape.
A test for a genuine meteorite.
No, nothing.
- It isn't one?
- No.
- It may not be.
- What about the fact of it being hollow?
A small cavity is not unheard of.
But according to the ploughman there was a smell of gas.
Seven different gases can occur in stony meteorites. We've nothing positive to go on.
- Father, did you find out anything?
- Some.
- Where's Johnny?
- He's not with me.
- I'm afraid he's in some sort of trouble.
- Trouble?
Yes, he's not well. He's being looked after.
- But where is he?
- In a strange place.
- A very strange place.
- For heaven's sake, tell us!
We went to the ploughman as we intended.
He wasn't very co-operative.
No, there was nothing more you could have done. I see that.
I didn't leave it at that.
I went to the county police.
They were polite, but said they had no jurisdiction.
How do you connect these meteorites with this mysterious production plant?
- Think they came from it?
- No, I'm certain of that.
- What do you think is wrong with Johnny?
- He was affected with this gas.
- How about phoning where he is stationed?
- He's at a temporary training post.
The base camp. They may know something.
Yes, I'll do that.
- Leo, there's more to it.
- I thought so.
It wasn't only the gas that affected Dillon.
There was something... else.
- You saw it?
- Just for a minute, clinging to his face.
- What?
- I may be wrong, but just for a moment...
It was like a soap bubble that burst.
It wasn't unlike a bubble.
Perhaps I'm imagining it.
But ever since that time, so long ago...
- Perhaps I'm too ready to... to expect...
- Take a look at this.
I got a plaster cast made of the first meteorite.
Now, assuming that the shape suffered from ablation in the higher levels of the atmosphere, with a little reconstruction...
...the original might well have been like this.
- You've been busy.
- It's more than a guess. We worked it out.
Something like this, travelling at the correct angle, not too fast...
Could skim through Earth's atmosphere before breaking itself up, gradually losing speed through braking ellipses and even land in one piece.
- The same principle as rocket descent.
- And that, of course, implies a great deal.
Rocket descent. The result of knowledge.
Mathematics. Precise planning.
Intelligence.
Now, we know the weight, the approximate speed of descent, mass...
- I've got some further data.
- Excellent.
How do you feel? Up to making a start?
If we can find some sort of a source...
- Any news?
- He couldn't return to his unit.
He's being transferred.
- The radar post? Moved from that position?
- Could that be significant?
Probably not. I'm going up to London tomorrow.
I'll probably get the answers then.
Paula, you must leave us. We have work to do.
Oh, don't worry about that.
It's just some idle speculation of Leo's.
No...
No!
Come in, sir.
Do sit down.
You've come at a most awkward time.
I'm just tying up a very difficult case.
- You asked to see Inspector Lomax.
- I know him.
I'm afraid he's no longer with us.
- I hope I won't embarrass you with this query.
- It won't be easy, sir. Try.
Last night I... happened to trespass upon a prohibited area.
Really? An army range?
Excuse me.
Inspector Clifford. Uh-huh?
Yes, I know. The embezzlement case.
You've got him there?
I suppose there's no doubt that he was a witness?
Right you are, Sergeant.
Well, keep him there for a moment, will you?
- Now, sir, about this prohibited area.
- I admit it's a technical offence.
We shall assume you did not go there as an enemy agent.
When we were near the plant, my friend was taken ill. The guards arrested him.
- The plant. Where exactly was it?
- At a place called Winnerden Flats.
- I'm afraid I can't help you.
- There are matters needing investigation.
- I can do nothing. It's under special authority.
- What authority? What's its purpose?
- Now you do embarrass me.
- This man was ill. He was affected by...
I've got to know his condition. Great Heavens!
I didn't expect to find bureaucratic idiocy here!
I know my duty, sir.
If you must have special favours, go to your own contacts at the Ministry.
Ministry?
I must ask you to leave now. I have things to do.
- The same Ministry that handles my research?
- Good morning, sir.
Tell Sergeant Best to bring that man up right away. The embezzlement witness!
We've a great deal to get through.
Pompous, self-important people coming here...
Well, there you are.
You've got all the evidence I can produce, all the facts as I know them.
Now, Fowler, it's up to you.
Man, haven't you ANY reaction?
I want you to get in touch with Mr Vincent
Broadhead. In the lower conference room.
441, isn't it? Find out if they're in recess.
Ask him to come up here as soon as he can.
- Was that a sufficiently dramatic response?
- I hope you're not taking this lightly.
On the contrary. I'm going beyond the limits.
Quatermass, we've had dealings for a number of years, you as a driving force of an enterprise of the future,
I as one of the obstructive civil servants you have to contend with.
- My dear Fowler...
- How's it going?
- I haven't referred to that.
- How is it?
- Badly, since that trouble on test.
- You'll want extra funds?
And you'll refuse them?
We've been cutting you down.
The decision lies elsewhere.
- It always does.
- It's policy to support a number of projects.
- That makes them, in a sense, your rivals.
- What are you getting at?
Well, it could be said that to come with such a curious account about a rival project...
- Are you serious?
- I must put it to you.
But I didn't know it was yours!
- Thank you. I accept that.
- Now, what is it?
- Strictly between these walls?
- Of course.
The place at Winnerden Flats is harmless.
It's to make synthetic food.
Synthetic food?!
Guards and guns?!
Oh, I have no personal knowledge.
It's an entirely different section, a new special section.
- You don't like it either.
- Like it?
Oh, I expect I'm hidebound.
Nothing you can pin down.
A face in the corridor.
Yes...
Petty mysteries.
An overheard phrase.
Altered routines. Changes.
Hello. Yes?
The recess? And Mr Broadhead?
- Thank you. On his way up.
- Who is he?
You don't read the newspapers?
He's usually a rugged individualist or a damned troublemaker.
- An MP?
- Quite a new boy. I knew him years ago.
He's a talker.
Just now he's engaged in a sort of one-man inquiry that he's managed to force.
- Inquiry?
- He's ahead of you.
It's into Winnerden Flats.
- Mr Fowler's expecting me. Broadhead.
- Oh, yes, sir.
Somebody with him?
What's this about, Fowler?
I hope you realise how little time I've got.
Here's someone I think you ought to meet.
Don't take any calls for the next few minutes.
Yes, sir.
- And all this happened last night?
- All that I was personally concerned with, yes.
I don't know what to make of it.
There's oddness enough.
- At the inquiry?
- Aye. I resume in five minutes.
- What sort of oddness?
- Confine yourself to giving information.
No, it's too much.
All this stuff you're telling me is speculation.
- It's true. I have expert knowledge.
- You specialise in rockets and things.
- The specialist sees things in his own light.
- A stupid generalisation.
There were those armed guards...
A sick man arrested. I'll try to use that.
- Who are on this inquiry?
- Please, please.
No, let him ask it. I've been sickened with damn secrecy this morning.
Members of the Commission and me.
It's to be a one-man confidential report.
Silly, isn't it?
More secrecy, but the fight I had even for that and, in the end, through a technical loophole.
How's it going? Finding what you wanted?
They're beating me, I admit it. Evasion!
Never once an answer that means anything.
And this is the joke - I'm trying to help them!
- Do you know what Winnerden Flats is?
- Synthetic food.
A revolutionary process. Years of vain experiment. Suddenly, bingo - they've got it!
- When?
- About a year ago.
A headlong rush then to get a factory built.
Tremendous costs.
- What was the hurry?
- To beat the rest of the world to it.
- Now they're ready to go ahead.
- Production?
- Any day now, apparently.
- I see.
There's no signs of a distribution set-up.
No sales organisation, nothing.
They're trapped in their damn secrecy!
And now this.
- A production plant.
- Aye, an aerial photograph of it.
- Here's another. The same?
- Seems to be.
That one was taken on an inspection flight over Central Siberia.
- What?!
- And this.
Brazil.
Not much doubt about it, is there?
Other people are in on this "revolutionary process"!
- They've got competitors before they start.
- No, that's not it.
- How long since those were taken?
- All very recent.
Broadhead, get me into that inquiry.
As a witness.
I've got to get in there!
All right. Come on.
Here you are. Sit down.
All here?
This is Professor Bernard Quatermass.
I've asked him to attend.
He has certain information
I wish to bring forward.
But, first, have you considered what I put to you before the recess?
A leakage of information.
In spite of all precautions.
In spite of what seemed excessive precautions.
Will you look at these aerial photographs again?
You, sir, Mr Stenning.
As Chief Biochemist to the Commission, can you give me an expert opinion?
Pick 'em up and look at 'em.
There - the mark.
We've gotta figure out where that power fade comes from.
Okay, I'll see you later.
Bye.
You ever think of trying sleep instead of benzedrine?
You know, you might like it.
Brother, I've had some tough nuts to crack in my time.
Thanks.
But nothing like this.
And to top it off, this guy has to go and get himself killed right outside.
- If he was killed.
- What do you mean?
Well, he could have died from natural causes, you know.
Oh. That's a switch coming from a base security man.
You fellows are usually suspicious of everything.
Here's the sentry's reports, and, uh, this just came in from the FBI.
- That's what they have on the dead man Griselle.
- Oh, yeah?
"Jacques Griselle, 35.
French Canadian.
"Graduated Toronto University.
Specialized in scientific farming.
"Good war record.
Born in Toronto.
"Went north for farming after the war.
Has sister Barbara, age 24, living on the farm with him."
Well, both the Griselles got a clean slate. There's nothing suspicious.
Yeah? What was Griselle doing in the woods at 3:00 in the morning?
- Farming?
- Cigarette?
No, thanks.
What are you gonna do now? Get yourself all involved in this business?
Let the local authorities figure it out, Jeff.
The colonel doesn't think it's that easy, and neither do I.
Besides, who can forget the look on that dead man's face?
There's probably some simple explanation.
Hmm. I don't know.
Maybe Doc Warren has the answer.
He should be finished with the autopsy by now. Let's go on over.
Okay.
- Morning, Doc.
- Morning, Jeff, Hal.
- Hi, Doc.
- I've just been trying to get you.
- Well, what's the story?
- Sit down.
- I wasn't able to perform your autopsy.
- Why not?
Because the mayor of Winthrop and a local doctor named Bradley, who's the coroner too, came up and claimed the body this morning.
- Why didn't you call me?
- The mayor had already talked to the colonel.
- Oh, that's ridiculous.
- They've got the body, so it's finished.
Finished?
I wouldn't bet on it.
They'll probably blame the death on our atomic reactors.
Mmm, it's this fear of radioactive fallout.
We're not exploding atom bombs.
We're just using atomic power for our radar experiments.
Go out and tell him that.
You know, we're 1,000 miles from the nearest decent-sized city.
What a bunch of backward people.
They've blamed us for too little rain, too much rain, the blight, the beetle, even Mrs. O'Leary's ailing cow.
We have to have an autopsy, so we can prove the death wasn't caused by radiation.
Well, the coroner said it was heart failure. That oughta do it.
He's one of them.
- Well, you can't figure their minds, though.
Excuse me, sir.
Colonel Butler phoned... to ask the major to report to his office right away.
All right, Mr. Mayor, if that's the way it is, no sense in asking you again, is there?
No, sir. There'll be no autopsy.
Come in.
Ah, Major Cummings.
- You sent for me, sir?
- Yes, Major.
I'd like to introduce
Miss Barbara Griselle and Mayor Hawkins.
- Major Cummings.
- How do you do?
- Major.
- If you don't mind,
I've made up my mind.
Just this one point.
You know that our governments,
Canada and the U.S.A., have set up this base as a joint protection for our people.
We know that, and we've told you that we feel that the refusal of an autopsy...
Sorry, Miss Griselle... Refusing to do it won't disrupt the effort.
Miss Griselle, Mayor Hawkins,
I'm no parley diplomat,
I'm an army man.
I'm straightforward, maybe even blunt.
But I'm afraid I must use stronger methods of persuasion.
Do you recognize this,
Miss Griselle?
It's your brother's notebook.
He's made some very interesting notations.
Major, take a look at this page here.
What's it look like to you?
It's a timetable schedule.
Do you note the times indicated in each line?
- What is it?
- Why, the schedule of our takeoffs and landings.
That's enough to give me what I want, Miss Griselle.
- May I have a look at that notebook?
- Give it to her, Major.
Thank you.
This schedule is a list of your takeoff and landings.
Our herds milk at four-nothing cream content, and my brother felt it was due to the jets flying overhead.
That's why he was gathering this information.
If you notice in the following pages, here's what it says:
"Helen: Less nervous today, quality low.
"Diane: Apathetic, quality poor.
Mabel: Very pert, general improvement. "
And so on with the other members of the herd.
This was a daily reaction of each cow.
Perhaps the colonel can tell us what he thought the items referred to.
I guess that's all we have to discuss.
Thank you for coming.
The colonel's a nice guy really, but he does have his problems.
- You don't have to apologize for him.
- Well, I'm not.
It's just that he has a job to do, a difficult one under the circumstances.
Please, I'd rather not discuss it.
Okay. I was only trying to...
- Trying to what?
- Oh, I don't know.
I guess I was looking for a way to say
I understand what you've been through.
- Do you?
- What the heck? We're all human here.
We're not monsters from outer space.
- Well, thanks.
- What for?
Oh, for the lift and the words of comfort.
I wish I could do more.
I have no hard feelings, if that's what you're thinking.
Well, I was, but not anymore.
So long.
Control ready, sir.
Green Dog, Green Dog, this is Pyramid.
Are you ready for Test Baker? Over.
This is Green Dog. This is Green Dog.
We are circling quite easily at 40,000 feet.
Standing by for Test Baker.
Over.
Okay, Green Dog, commence Test Baker.
Commence Test Baker.
Over.
Try starting out on the 500 mile range.
Set for the 500 mile range,
Sergeant.
Master scope set at 500 mile range.
Generators set.
Position six Charlie.
Start scanning, normal speed.
Scanning, normal speed.
Increase scanning speed 20 rpm's.
Scanning now, 20 rpm's.
Increase range to 1,000 miles.
Range increased to 1,000 miles, sir.
Steady on your sensitive control, number three.
Right, sir.
Increase range to 1,500 miles.
Range increasing to 1,500 miles, sir.
- Hold it steady now, Sergeant.
- Right, sir.
Okay, Sergeant, increase to 2,000 miles.
Increasing range to 2,000 miles, sir.
Range increased to 2,000.
Look, sir. Siberia.
Increase range to 2,500 miles.
Range increased to 2,500, sir.
If we can keep this equipment working right, we can watch those Russians 24 hours a day right in their own backyard.
We can spot any plane, any missile, anything that's airborne.
Image is fading, sir.
There it goes again.
Same trouble.
Green Dog, Green God, this is Pyramid.
Check your equipment.
Our image is fading. Over.
This is Green Dog.
This is Green Dog.
Our equipment is working okay. Over.
The signal's going out okay from here, sir. There's no drop in power.
- There must be some interference.
There's no other answer.
- Try increasing the power.
We're pushing the atomic plant as much as we can now.
We've got to lick this power fade.
Tell them to pour it on.
Peterson.
Pete, this is Cummings,
Master Control.
We want you to give us everything you've got.
But Jeff, we've already exceeded the designed limits.
Every time you take a test you ask for more power.
If I take any more rods out, the reactor's liable to go out of control.
Well, take some more out.
We'll have to risk it.
- We've got to have more power.
- Okay, it's your funeral.
Mine too, probably.
- Yes, sir?
- Remove ten more rods from reactor number three.
- That's crazy, sir.
- Yeah, I know, but it's an order.
Power's been boosted, sir, but still can't increase image further.
It doesn't matter how much we boost the transmitter power if it doesn't reach the plane.
You know, it's almost as if the power were being drained off.
Well, we'll just have to keep working on it.
And in the meantime, what new excuse do I give the Pentagon?
This is Green Dog.
This is Green Dog.
Standing by for instructions. Over.
Okay, Green Dog.
Okay, Green Dog.
Test Baker is completed.
Return to base.
Repeat, Test Baker is completed.
Return to base. Over.
- Roger and out.
- Okay, Sergeant, let's close shop.
Jacques Griselle's sum of good overshadows the other.
What has he marked up in the ledger for good... as against the ledger for bad?
He was a good and generous man...
And now we consecrate the worldly remains of our beloved Jacques...
to the good earth from whence he sprang.
- Closer and closer.
- Thank goodness the cows are getting used to them.
Aye.
Are we eating soon?
It'll be ready in a minute.
I just want to feed the chickens first.
Amelia! Amelia!
Amelia! Amelia!
What is it?
What is it?
What happened?
Amelia!
- Can I see you home, Barbara?
- No, thank you, Mayor.
I think I better go back with Professor
Walgate, keep my mind occupied.
Are you sure you want to?
My work can wait, you know.
Say, Mayor!
Ben Adams and his wife are dead, same as young Griselle.
- Where?
- Up at their farm.
At the edge of the air base.
But Mayor Hawkins, you're taking a great deal for granted.
There is absolutely no evidence... pointing to radioactive fallout... or radioactive contamination of any kind.
Yes, we'll do everything we can,
I assure you.
Yes. Yes. Good-bye.
In addition to our headaches with the Pentagon, we're now being accused of killing off the people in this town.
Perhaps they'd cooperate, sir, if we could explain more about our antimissile program.
- Not the secrets...
- You know that's impossible, Jeff.
Come in.
It'll be rough if the town turns against us.
Sir, we began a complete investigation of the Adams farm, but the local constable, a man named Gibbons, told us to get off the place.
Said it came under his jurisdiction, and we had no business being there.
What kind of cooperation do you call that?
They're nervous, upset. We've got to find out how those people died.
Suppose you get all of the Adams' relatives.
See if you can persuade them to let us do an autopsy.
- Yes, sir, I'll try.
- Reassure them. Promise them anything.
But get hold of those bodies.
I made a complete autopsy on both cases.
I called Dr. Bradley in to check my findings, and our opinions concur.
It's fantastic.
On examination of the skull of Mr. Adams,
I noticed two small holes on the base of the occipital region here.
They penetrated to the medulla oblongata, where the spinal cord meets the brain.
I opened the skull to investigate and found this.
The brain, it's gone!
Yes, sucked out like an egg through those two holes.
That's not all.
The entire spinal cord is missing.
But it... it's incredible.
It's as if some mental vampire were at work.
Where has the brain and spinal cord gone?
I'm a doctor, Colonel, not a detective.
There's nothing like this in the books.
Major Cummings had the best explanation so far... mental vampire.
That's rubbish!
Possibly some animal...
Colonel, Colonel, I've lived in these backwoods all my life, and I can assure you there's no animal in these parts that could do that.
Maybe that guy Gibbons was right about the supernatural.
Well, whatever the explanation, we'll find it.
We must find it.
In the meantime, Doctor,
I trust I can rely on your discretion.
Not to tell the mayor or the townspeople?
Of course. I've got an overworked practice as it is, Colonel.
Thank you.
Dr. Warren, I want you to get on the phone.
Consult the top medical specialists, wherever they are.
- Yes, sir.
- Captain, contact the best authorities.
Tell them what the problem is.
Find out what they have to say.
Jeff, the townsfolk know you.
Talk to them.
Check on anything that seems to be extraordinary, no matter what it is.
Hello?
Anybody home?
Uh, Miss Griselle?
Oh, Miss Griselle, I, uh...
Great.
Look, um, Miss Griselle,
I'm sorry for, um, barging in like that.
But, well, I knocked and there was no answer.
The door was open, so l...
Make yourself at home, Major.
I'll be out in a minute.
Uh, thank you.
Found something interesting?
Oh, I was just glancing around...
That's all right. Prof. Walgate was preparing these for publication anyway.
- Are you collating his material?
- I do most of it.
He dictates on this.
I edit the tapes and prepare the draft manuscripts.
- That's some job.
- Mmm, but interesting.
The professor must be quite a guy... thought control, sibonetics, all that stuff.
That's only half of it.
Strange, isn't it, finding a man like that here in Winthrop?
In these uncivilized backwoods,
I think you were going to say.
Well, I'm afraid so.
The explanation is quite a simple one.
Prof. Walgate had a stroke about five years ago.
- He's retired now.
- Well, he still works.
- And at odd hours.
- Odd hours?
He thinks nothing of starting work at 11:00 at night... and working until the small hours of the morning.
The mayor mentioned that Walgate was an authority on psychic phenomena.
- Is that still a hobby if his?
- I don't know.
If it is, he'll have
Dr. Bradley after him.
Dr. Bradley said no more overwork or excitement.
- What about you?
- What do you mean?
Don't you ever get some time off?
Well, sometimes.
Hello, Howard.
Come on in.
Oh, this is Major Cummings from the base.
Yeah, I know.
We've met.
Well, I guess
I'll be running along.
You've only just been here a few minutes.
I was just passing on my way back to the base.
Quite a roundabout route.
The new airfield extension covers a lot of ground.
- Too much for Winthrop's liking.
- It must keep you busy.
Yes, yes, there's a lot to do.
- I'll bet there is.
- Come again?
You found that G.I. Killer yet?
You'd be far better off huntin' him down instead of tomcattin' around here.
I should bust you...
Cut it out, the both of you!
Come on!
Sorry. I hope
I didn't break anything.
I think you'd better leave. You've done enough damage for one morning.
- Good night, sir.
- Oh, good night, Sergeant.
When you tell me you haven't known me long enough...
Oh. Yeah, okay.
Okay, I'll see ya later.
How do you like that? She says we haven't been properly introduced.
And she's a nurse.
I hope you made out better with the museums and stuff.
- They all think I'm crazy.
How'd you make out?
- We've got work to do.
Uh-uh. You're the guy who works after 5:00, not me.
This is serious. I want you to get me all the information you can on Prof. Walgate.
Everything he's ever written... books, articles, everything.
Don't worry. I'll have this guy in check by tomorrow night.
So long, Mayor.
All right, fellas, all right.
Let's stop this nonsense.
No fancy atomic radiation caused these deaths.
What about the mayor?
What killed him?
Who are you trying to fool?
It's the atomic fallout.
Hold it, fellas! Hold it!
Someone murdered the mayor.
The same maniac that killed Jacques
Griselle, Ben Adams and his wife.
- Where is he?
- If you'll shut up, I'll tell you.
Quiet there. Let him talk.
Now, the fellow we're after is out there in the woods.
Probably some mad G.I.
That's gone wild.
He can't move far if we move fast.
- Let's stop jabbering and get after him!
- Let's get him!
All right, now. Let's go!
Right, fellas.
Let's find this guy.
- Keep a sharp lookout, okay?
- Yeah, Gibbons.
Okay, let's go.
Excuse me, sir.
This just came in from the FBI.
Hmm. "Walgate. Brilliant scientist.
Recluse. Considered highly eccentric."
That old guy Walgate sounds like a cross between Einstein and Robinson Crusoe.
It gets more interesting all the time.
Okay, Sergeant,
I'm going out for a while.
Well, hello.
Nice to see you again.
I'm very busy.
Well, I'd like to see the professor.
Oh. Yes, of course.
Thank you.
Come in.
Prof. Walgate, Major Cummings from the air base to see you.
- Sorry to barge in like this, Professor.
- Not at all.
These days I welcome any excuse to stop work.
Isn't that so, Barbara?
Please take a chair, Major.
Thank you.
I came to see you about this business with the mayor.
Oh, terrible tragedy.
Really terrible.
- I need your help.
- Anything you say. Just name it.
This is the fourth death in the space of a few days.
Not only are they terrible tragedies, but they're turning the townsfolk against us.
It's just ignorance, my dear fellow.
These people are simple, one might say.
Narrow in their outlook.
Of course, the very secrecy of your activities doesn't help.
This development of radar boosted by atomic power.
What gave you that idea, sir?
There was a piece in the Patents Journal about your work on reactors.
It wasn't a year ago I read somewhere about the new radar patents.
Wasn't this territory's idea for that kind of work.
I put two and two together.
- And made five?
- Shall we say four and a half?
But you don't have to worry, Major.
What I surmise I keep to myself.
- Well, I hope so, sir.
- Let me offer you a drink. Whiskey?
Uh, yes, please.
Straight.
- Barbara?
- Uh, no, thank you, Professor.
I'll have the last chapter finished tomorrow.
That's fine.
That's real progress.
I've already begun on volume two.
My mind is really buzzing with these strange words.
Just a few elementary ideas on the subject, Major.
Not so advanced as present-day developments.
I'll transcribe these while you talk. Excuse me.
That business with her brother...
She was devoted to him.
Yes, it was a tough break.
I don't want to seem morbid, but did you see his face after he died?
- Yes.
- What was it like?
I have a reason for asking.
Well, it was an expression of complete horror.
Fright.
Almost insane, I guess.
- What is it? What gives?
- Did you get him?
- Okay, fellas, okay.
- Was it him?
No, just a false alarm.
That's all.
As you said yourself, sir, the people here are simple and superstitious.
- Maybe they're not so wrong after all.
- What do you mean?
Mmm, about the supernatural.
Something unreal, something never seen by anyone before.
I can't accept that.
I've always disproved such theories.
- What is it, then?
- Nothing supernatural, I'm sure.
I can't believe that.
I'm a scientist.
You've made a study of psychic phenomena, haven't you?
It can't be that!
It can't be!
Professor, you know what Dr. Bradley said.
Was it absolutely necessary to upset the professor?
It's nothing, nothing, Barbara.
The major and I were just having a quiet talk. I got dizzy.
Well, your quiet little talk is over, Major.
First Howard Gibbons, now the professor.
Do you have to go around making trouble?
- You really believe that, don't you?
- I can believe my eyes.
I'm sorry, Professor.
I didn't mean to disturb you.
No, not at all.
Forgive me if I don't rise.
Yes, certainly. Excuse me.
It's me! It's Frank!
Have you finished searching the quarry yet?
Yeah, and the men are tired.
They want to go home.
But they can't quit now!
We've almost reached the air base.
Well, you better tell 'em.
They won't listen to me.
Okay, fellas, you spread out again.
We'll join up at the Adams' fence.
- Say, you hear something?
- Yeah. Funny sound.
You take that path, and I'll take this one.
- If you see anything, shout.
- You said not to let each other out of sight.
These parts run almost parallel to each other. We'll meet up a ways.
The dawn's beginnin' Let's wait a little. We'll see better then.
Oh, we're close to it.
Now come on, boy.
Go on, fella.
You take that way.
Gibbons! Gibbons!
Where are you?
Gibbons!
Where the heck are you?
Gibbons!
Gibbons! Gibbons!
Where are you?
Gibbons! Gibbons!
Gibbons!
I think you should go home,
Mrs. Gibbons.
No. I'm all right, Doctor.
I'll wait here for my boy.
Don't worry.
We'll find him.
Oh, where is Howard?
Where is he?
- We've searched everywhere.
- He just disappeared.
Oh, I don't believe it.
He must be there.
- I'm gonna look for him myself.
- You can't go in the woods alone.
Oh, but I've got to find him.
I've got to find my boy!
You'd better see that she gets home.
Get your wife to look after her.
- Have you searched the woods thoroughly?
- We kept calling for him.
If Gibbons is out there and alive, he would've heard us.
No point in searching any more.
I reckon we ought to call a council meeting... and decide what we're going to do.
- What about it, Bradley?
- Well, let's get Melville.
He's the deputy mayor.
I suppose it's up to him.
I think that's a good idea.
Good evening.
Everyone quiet, please.
You all know why we're here.
We've had four deaths, and now our constable has disappeared.
The cause of these deaths is still unknown.
Everybody seems to have their own ideas, and they all seem connected with the new air base.
- Now you're talkin'
- For this reason,
I've asked Major Cummings to this meeting.
He's going to help us in any way he possibly can.
That goes for his commanding officer, who is very concerned about what's happened.
Cut out the soft soap, Melville.
Let's get down to brass tacks.
All I know is, before this air base came here, we were doing fine.
Now you and these Air Force fellows tell us that it's not radiation at all.
Well, maybe you're right at that.
I don't know.
But forgetting about the deaths, how do you explain the change in quality of the cows' milk, even the quantity?
Let the major tell me about that.
Go ahead, Major.
No one can make anyone believe something if they don't want to believe it.
But it has been proven that there has been no radiation affecting anyone in Winthrop.
- Hmm.
- Not even the cows.
As for the milk... I don't know enough about farming, but I would assume...
Griselle did.
He knew his business.
So do I. It was the noise of the jets that did it.
It frightened the herd.
But I can tell you that the herd is normal again.
They've got used to it.
Thank you.
As for the deaths, gentlemen, we are equally at a loss to give an answer.
Now, there's been some talk of a mad G.I. On the prowl.
This, I can assure you, is not true.
We've checked and rechecked our personnel.
We know how you feel, but we're trying to protect our countries from a guided missile attack.
If you'd only help us instead of fighting us.
Ah, it's all a waste of time.
Let's get rid of the base.
We had no trouble before they came here.
I think that's rather extreme...
Gibbons!
It was terrible, Jeff.
What could have happened to him?
I don't know.
- Would you like a drink?
- No. No, thanks.
Barbara, I think Prof. Walgate is involved in these deaths.
- I don't understand.
- Neither do I. Maybe it's just a hunch.
But his background, his training...
- Oh, Jeff!
- Look, Barbara, I checked on Walgate.
This research of his...
Somehow I think it ties in with what's happened in Winthrop.
- Oh, that's crazy.
- Is it?
- Mind if I borrow this?
- Where are you going?
I'd like to take a look at your cemetery.
Hey! Hey!
Anybody out there?
I'm locked in here!
Hey!
Hey!
- Any word yet from Major Cummings?
- Not a thing yet, sir.
- Well, keep trying.
- Hello?
Hello, Miss Griselle.
This is Captain Chester.
I've been trying to locate Major Cummings.
- He left here about 7:30.
- Well, did he say where he was going?
Yes. He borrowed a flashlight and said something about going to the cemetery.
Look, I don't like the sound of all this.
You wait there.
I'll be over right away.
Are you sure this is the place?
Oh, this is the place all right.
Hey, listen.
- Huh?
- Listen.
I don't hear anything.
Wait a minute.
Over this way.
There's someone inside all right.
It's jammed.
Here, hold this.
- Oh, hurry! Come on!
- Hold the flashlight closer.
There, it's coming.
Here he is!
Jeff! Jeff!
There's no air in here.
Keep the door open.
- He'll be all right.
- Jeff, it's me... Barbara.
- Are you all right?
- Barbara.
Yeah, you're not dreaming, buddy, it's Barbara.
- I was locked in, no air.
- Take it easy now.
Come on, we'll get you back to the base.
- I gotta see Walgate.
- You're in no shape to see anybody.
I've got to see Walgate.
Come in.
Good evening.
Major Cummings.
Oh, Barbara...
It's very late.
I hope you don't mind, sir.
Oh, on the contrary,
I'm glad to see you. Sit down.
We missed you at the town council meeting.
I saw Gibbons afterwards.
His mind was gone completely mad.
- It was dreadful.
- I was hoping maybe you could help us.
- Me? How can I help you?
- You're an atomic expert.
- Who told you that?
- Our files in Washington.
- Have you been checking on me?
- Yes.
- Oh.
- Here, would you care for a cigarette, Professor?
No, thanks.
I'm attached to my pipe.
Uh, Professor,
I read one of your books... on the materialization of thought.
You denied that it was possible, but the thought was intriguing.
Yes, if it could be done, why, man could create power by thought.
He could will a door to open.
He could perform useful work without moving from this chair.
- Practically anything.
- I said it was impossible, didn't I?
Is it? Perhaps with atomic power it could be done.
Oh, please. I'm tired and sick.
Stop badgering me.
I will if you'll answer me a few questions.
- Jeff!
- I'm sorry, but I've got to go on.
What were you doing in the cemetery tonight?
Were you, uh, looking for this?
I didn't mean to shut you in, close the door on you.
I was frightened when I heard you.
I only wanted time to get away.
I only realized later that you might be shut, trapped.
- I called Barbara, but...
- If she hadn't rescued me,
I wouldn't be alive.
- Jeff!
- What were you doing there, Professor?
I had to examine the mayor's body.
I had to find out the truth.
What was that?
Professor, what's the matter?
- Here, sit back.
- Professor, can you hear me?
It's a terrible story.
Shut down your atomic plant, Major.
Call Dr. Bradley right away.
I'm going back to the base.
Jeff... be careful.
I'm afraid.
I'll be back right away.
I'd like to try that again when I have more time.
But the thing's fantastic.
You can't shut down a whole atomic power plant on such a wild theory.
We can't deny the facts, sir.
Griselle, the Adams couple, the mayor.
They all died a few minutes after the peak of our radar tests, right after our atomic plant was operating under full power.
But it'll take months to get the plant operating again.
That's better than risking any more lives or madmen like Gibbons.
Okay, let's put it on ice.
How soon will you be ready, Pete?
We'll shut her down in five minutes.
- The rods are all smashed!
- What happened?
- I don't know.
- We'll never be able to shut her down now.
- What about spares?
- We have no extras of anything.
There must be some way of controlling the reaction.
Without the rods, we don't stand a chance.
The nearest supply would be at the Hanford Works on the Columbia River.
- How soon can we get a shipment flown in?
- Four to six hours.
Get me the Hanford Works on the Columbia River right away.
Well, Doc, how is he?
Oh, there's no question.
It's another attack, a little more serious than the last.
- He'll be all right?
- Oh, sure, sure, sure.
See he gets plenty of rest.
Call me if there's any change.
For goodness sake, get somebody out here to stay with you.
Jeff... Major Cummings said he'll be back soon.
Jeff? Major Cummings?
Mm-hmm.
Obviously, those rods were destroyed.
How and for what reason we don't know.
But we do know that we're in trouble up here.
Serious trouble.
Hello. Yes, put her through.
It's for you, Jeff.
Barbara Griselle.
Thank you.
Hello, Barbara.
Okay, good.
We'll be right over.
Right. Bye.
Walgate's regained consciousness.
I think we better get over there.
- Right.
- Al, we better get some sidearms.
Kasper, get hold of Dr. Bradley and Melville right away.
Have them meet us at Walgate's house.
I should feel better after I've told you everything.
Maybe you can help me to clear up this ghastly business.
But no matter what you do to me, remember those horrible deaths were beyond my control.
Go on, Professor.
For many years now,
I have been working on a theory of thought materialization.
The entire apparatus to give it the required boost... is in my laboratory.
Laboratory?
I didn't know you had one.
There are many things you didn't know, my child.
If you had, you'd never have come here again.
You can see it later.
I knew I could never succeed on the principles of telepathy.
I needed to stimulate my brain... to the extent that I could detach thought from my conscious... to give it a separate entity of its own.
I concentrated on the simplest experiment:
To turn the page of a book.
I designed an instrument to create...
a sudden and powerful electrical boost...
to help me free my thought.
But each application of the electric charge...
created a shock almost equal to electrocution.
It made me ill.
Dr. Bradley diagnosed exhaustion.
He thought my illness was caused by overwork...
in getting my papers ready for publication.
He introduced me to Barbara Griselle.
With Barbara as my secretary,
I was able to satisfy my publisher...
and continue my experiments to materialize thought.
For a long time, I persisted in this one experiment...
without success... until one night.
The lightning, in striking the house, gave my instruments a sudden violent charge of power.
And my thought was free, free to turn the page of a book.
I altered the design of my equipment...
to generate these violent power boosts.
But it was very dangerous,
and I could only undergo each experiment...
after a long period of rest.
Whenever I felt well enough to absorb the shock,
I found no difficulty in moving small objects.
Eventually, I developed a certain tolerance...
to the high voltages I used.
But what I really needed for regular experiments...
was a new form of power, something that was smoother,
something that would flow through my brain without causing collapse.
The new atomic plant at the air base provided me with this power.
I devised additional apparatus that enabled me...
to divert a portion of the atomic power...
that was radiating between the ground station...
and the radar aircraft circling 40,000 feet above.
It was power which I could control,
and I learned how to amplify my thoughts without hurting myself.
I was able to detach my thoughts...
and allow them to work on their own.
I began to devise a being...
into which the thought, once released,
could enter and preserve itself for all humanity.
I envisaged something akin to the human brain...
with life and mobility...
but without the limitations of man's body.
I concentrated my entire thought on its creation.
I succeeded!
But, like thought itself, it was invisible.
That night I entered my laboratory...
to take advantage of a radar test...
only to find the place in shambles,
my equipment wrecked beyond repair.
All of my notes about its creation...
and how I thought it could be controlled...
were destroyed.
I knew now that
I had created a fiend.
There was no other explanation.
I was helpless, but whom could I tell?
Who would believe such a fantastic story?
I could sense the presence of the fiend there in the room with me,
growing more powerful with each succeeding day.
My one desire was to destroy the thing,
but I possessed no means of projecting my thought to do so.
Then I could hear it.
Was it possible that there were more than one?
I was unable to stop them.
They were now drawing power from the atomic station.
Its intelligence had expanded.
It now knew how to escape.
And then followed these horrible deaths and Gibbons' madness.
I had to know what I had done.
I had to see one of the bodies.
I went to the mayor's tomb.
I now know that I have created a mental vampire, a fiend that needs to drain the intellect... to survive and multiply.
I'll get it.
Supposing you're right, Professor, how does it live?
How else but on the brains and nerve centers... removed from these dead people.
Then where are they, and why can't we see them? This is nonsense.
We're facing a new form of life... that nobody understands.
I believe it feeds on the radiation from your atomic plant, and that it's evil.
Professor, it's my opinion that the evil's all in your mind.
You're in need of medical assistance.
Doctor, I'm glad you're here.
This man's become a raving lunatic.
Hey, what's going on out there?
Hey, look!
Hello. Hello!
Professor, what's wrong with your telephone?
Nothing should be the matter, unless they've got enough intelligence to cut the lines.
Jeff, I want you to get over to the air base. I want emergency patrols.
He's dead.
Give me a hand with this.
Barricade those windows!
Have you got anything we can nail across that window?
There's some lumber in my laboratory.
- I've gotta get out!
- Oh, pull yourself together and help me with this!
Well, at least lock the door!
Oh, never mind!
- Hey, Captain, give me a hand.
- Yes, sir.
If we'd only see them, we'd know what to do.
- Is there any way to make them visible?
- Not that I know.
Unless it's a question of the amount of atomic radiation that's available.
Hello? Hello, Kasper?
I want to talk to the colonel.
Hello? Hello, Kasper?
Are you there? Hello, hello?
I've got to get out of here,
I tell you!
Oh, no, no.
Melville, no, no.
Get back. Get back.
Melville, Melville, get a grip on yourself.
- Get ahold of yourself.
- But l...
Why are they so quiet?
Maybe they're gonna leave us alone.
I doubt it. But they've just put out a burst of energy.
Perhaps they need to rest.
Colonel Butler, how long does it take to shut down your atomic plant?
- Why?
- If my theory is right, without the radiation of which
I was speaking, these things must die.
- Good grief!
- What is it?
What do you see?
Let me through!
Hey, Jeff, Professor, they're becoming visible!
Someone or something must have increased the power at the atomic plant.
What have I unleashed?
- It's ghastly! It's horrible!
- You can say that again.
It all ties up with what
Dr. Warren explained to us.
Look carefully.
Al, get those sidearms.
I'm sure it's the atomic plant.
So long as it goes on, they will multiply,
getting stronger and stronger.
Yeah, well, we'll see about that.
Well, anyway, they're mortal.
Hold it!
You'll hit him!
- He's dead.
- We've got to stop 'em!
There's only one way:
Shut down your atomic plant.
Unless we shut off the radiation, we'll all be destroyed.
- Heaven knows how many others.
- There's a dynamite shed between here and the plant.
If I can get through,
I can blow up the control room.
Well, if that's the way it's got to be.
- I'm afraid it is.
- Jeff!
Must it be you, Jeff?
- I know the control room layout.
- Be careful, Jeff, please.
Yeah, I will.
And be sure and lock this door.
He can't go alone. He won't last a minute amongst those fiends.
It's too late, Professor.
Somebody had to get through.
Then cover him as he leaves the house.
And shoot straight.
Don't waste the shot.
- Do you see him?
- No, not yet.
- You can't, Professor!
- It's suicide!
They're my creation.
Perhaps I can control them.
Give Jeff a chance.
Lock it after me.
- That was a brave man.
- What's gonna happen to Jeff?
Take it easy now.
I know that guy.
If anybody can get through, he can.
Oh, it's been so long since Jeff left.
Don't even think about it.
It's so quiet.
I wonder what they're up to.
We're almost out of ammunition.
Well, Captain, let's get started.
Doc, I'll send you some help as soon as I get over to the air base.
- Thanks, Colonel.
- What about Jeff?
He's been gone for hours.
Jeff! Jeff!
I thought that...
It's okay, honey.
It's all over.
Well, Major,
I'm leaving you in charge.
Report back when you have the situation well in hand.
- Good luck, Jeff.
- Thanks, boy.
Well, Doc, I hope now that we got this thing licked, you'll encourage your people to cooperate with us.
Well, I reckon we owe it to you, Major.
And it strikes me you are setting a very good example.
SPACEMEN APPEAR OVER TOKYO -Warning From Space-
- Dr. Kamura!
- Oh, Kimika.
I was hoping we'd get a chance to talk.
- Let me buy you a drink.
- Alright.
Thanks.
SAKE
RESTAURANT Utyu-Ken
- Oh, good evening doctor Kamura! welcome back.
- Madam Ohana.
Terrible weather, isn't it?
But even when it rains outside, the sun always shines in here.
Nothing to spoil your view of our sky!
Actually, doctor spends his days gazing at the skies through telescope...
So the rain gives his eyes a chance to rest.
I believe you're right!
- Doctor, shall I get you some hot sake?
- Yes.
Here's my latest newspaper article about the saucers.
UFOs SEEN OVER TOKYO.
Doctor, what do you think they are?
Sorry, I'm afraid I have no idea.
You must know something.
I understand your position that you have no definite answers, but...
At least give me some quote for my next article.
I'd love to, Hoshino, but I can say nothing.
Sir, please!
An interview with the Director of the
Observatory would be very important to me.
I suppose.
If I knew anything I'd tell you.
Could you at least make a guess?
Science doesn't work that way.
You can know 90% of something, but if you ignore the other 10% you don't know anything.
- Sure, but...
- Mr. Hideno!
Leave him alone!
He said he does not know.
A scientist is not like a politician who can answer every question.
Good evening.
Oh, you're here, Mr. Hideno!
Do I still have that assignment?
- What do you mean?
- What? You've forgotten already?
- The photos.
- Oh, yes, yes. Of course.
Thank you! Bye.
What was that he asked?
Sankichi's an amateur photographer.
If he gets pictures of a UFO,
I promised to publish them.
How about unicorns?
Oh, I almost forgot.
Dr. Kamura, I have a message.
Your daughter called.
She will be dining with her uncle tonight in Ushigome.
- Ah, thank you.
- Don't forget!
I didn't know you had a brother.
He's really my cousin.
The physicist Dr. Matsuda.
Oh, Dr. Eisuke Matsuda?
Everything looks delicious!
I don't know where to start.
- A little wine?
- Yes, thank you.
Do you have a favor to ask?
Not at all.
You know that's not my style.
Well, cheers.
You spoil me.
Don't laugh.
How long are you going to keep working in that nursery?
I love children.
So you say, but isn't it time to make your boyfriend your husband?
She has the look of love...
But maybe she's waiting for another's wedding proposal.
They seem like such a good match.
Transparency: 8 degrees.
Image...
What is that?
Well, that's odd...
What's wrong with my transistor radio?
How many payments behind are you?
Don't be funny!
It's never had any problems before.
What a strange signal...
- Thank you, madam.
- You're welcome.
- It must be a problem in the power station.
- I guess.
- Well, good night.
- Good night.
Look at these readings. It's crazy!
- Kimi, take over for me.
- Yes, sir.
Call Dr. Kamura and tell him I'm on my way over. It's urgent.
Right.
Yes, I'm Mikawa.
Dr. Kamura?
No, he was at Utyu-Ken.
Yes.
There's just no good fish in the market these past few days.
They say there are no fish in Tokyo Bay.
- It must be because of the UFOs.
- I guess so.
- Good evening!
- Hi. You're father just left.
- Has he eaten?
- Yes, he has.
Okay.
So you went to Ushigome for a marriage proposal?
- Yes.
- Congratulations!
- No, I did not accept...
- Taeko-san!
- Is your father still here?
- He just left. What is it?
Mr. Isobe needs to see him right away!
- Who? Toru?
- Yes.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
- Hello!
- Hi!
Taeko, please excuse us.
This meeting is quite important.
Yes, sir.
So you're convinced... this thing is a satellite from another country.
Well, that's what seems most logical.
If so, wouldn't we have known before?
Perhaps.
But if it's not a satellite...
Doctor, this may seem crazy but could there be any truth regarding the rumors of flying saucers?
A scientist should not jump to such conclusions.
A flying saucer!
San-Chan, where are you?
I'm here. Upstairs!
It's exactly what I saw with the telescope.
- It's not a meteor.
- You're right.
It was no meteor.
I saw it very clearly.
I need more data before I can formulate a theory.
You still don't think there are UFOs?
Well...
I guess I can no longer deny it.
I must get back!
UFO SIGHTED! COULD IT BE
A NEW FOREIGN WEAPON?
A FLYING OBJECT FELL
IN TOKYO BAY
ASTRONOMERS
KEEP SILENCE
We understand that you cannot deliver a conjecture but there were many witnesses and people are becoming afraid.
It's your duty to inform us.
We are doing everything possible to discover what it is.
We hope to give you an explanation soon.
- Have a little patience.
- For how long?
You said you saw it last night?
I got it. Thank you.
Tacabara at the
Observatory of Mexico
Saw the same luminous object last night.
Dr. Matsuda is here.
- Hello.
- Hello.
Yes, this is Tokyo.
- This is Kodaikanal, India.
- Yes...
Just last night we saw the same one over 200 miles. 
I got the same report from London. 
Yes, I got it.
Thank you.
India's Kodaikanal Observatory also saw it.
And, so...
Even our first step ia problem:
How to identify the object?
Perhaps...
We could used a rocket to take a photograph.
The University is making meteorological observations.
- I'll talk with Dr. Takashima.
- Good.
Yes, who is it?
Professor!
A call from Jyouhoku observatory.
Bait's still good...
What the... Look there!
What is that?
A monster!
A monster!
What the hell is that?
- I'll call Dr. Takashima.
- Okay.
- Have him stand by.
- Right.
Rocket range.
Rocket range.
- Ready for launch?
- Hold. 
Dr. Takashima, they're asking if you are ready.
Ready?
Give them the OK.
Ready.
Ready.
Ready!
Everyone take cover!
- Launch!
- Launch!
Launch!
Hello.
Thanks for coming.
As I said on the phone,
It may sound strange, but do not think this is a hoax.
There's an odd trace on the dock, as if the monster had risen from the sea.
- Let's take a look.
- Come.
Down there.
- Yoshida.
- Yes?
Bring a Geiger counter.
Without your help we could not have gotten those pictures.
Luckily it coincided with our launches.
What's taking so long?
The speed and distance
Will be noted in these pictures.
Here they are.
Is that it?
A tremendous energy release.
It can not be a satellite.
No satellite emits such an intense light.
That's right.
But it is hard to distinguish what's in these pictures.
- Sorry I could not be more help.
- It's okay.
I'll have prints sent to all the other observatories.
- Toru.
- Yes?
They sent your father to Banshu-Maru to investigate. Any news?
No. Since yesterday
I have not been home.
That's true.
"A Monster Invades The Earth!"
Sorry about your father.
He and your mother should be laughing at that right now.
- Hello, Mom.
- Hi, son!
I am so hungry!
- Dad isn't eating?
- I've called several times.
- Is he still working?
- He's analyzing specimens he brought home.
Has he found anything?
I don't know.
He hasn't left his office.
- When did you get back?
- Just now.
- Any news on the UFO?
- No, we did not find anything.
- Have you learned anything?
- Nothing at all.
Oh, it's so late!
Mama will complain that your dinner's cold.
You're right. I'd better go.
- Toru, come see.
- Yes.
Bring the Geiger counter.
Hello.
Did you stop at Utyu-Ken?
- No.
- Want a sake?
I do not feel like drinking.
What's happening?
The headquarters of the World Council announced
they are suspending all satellite launches. 
The Attack From The Sky. 
The National Council announced to the world
In case of air attack
Jet fighters will attempt to bring the saucers down. 
- Mysterious Luminous Bodies Disappear.
- Finally!
Oh. Come on.
NEW STAR,
HIKARI AOZORA
Doctor, they've reappeared!
The monster which appeared on the freighter in Shibaura, 
in Kawaguchi and Lake Biwa
appeared again last night at the Teito theater
during a concert by Hikari Aozora, creating panic in the room. 
End of news flash. 
It's terrible.
The whole world's going mad.
Everything is so strange.
Monsters, saucers...
I can't take any more.
So I guess Dr. Kamura is too busy to come tonight.
I guess so.
Here you are.
What are the results of your first mission?
Have you revealed the reason for our presence?
No, it was impossible for us.
Upon seeing us, they scatter in fear
As if they had seen something monstrous.
What?
Are we considered hideous?
Are they more beautiful than us?
No. Examine this.
This is what they consider a beautiful woman.
This is their concept of beauty?
It has a very large lump in the center of its face.
Yet, we can make immediate contact with them
If we assume the likeness of an Earthling.
We can not leave without saving the Earth.
It seems dangerous but time is desperately short.
Numbers 11 and 16, begin immediate surveillance of Dr. Kamura.
Number 18 will act as radio contact.
I request, sir, that I be allowed to carry out this project myself.
After all, it is my idea and I know the Earth better than anyone else.
Negative. The risk is too great.
Transmutation has never been attempted using a 2D pattern.
We don't know the effect it will have on you.
You are too valuable a scientist
To risk in such an experiment.
I believe it will be safe if the transmuter provides a covering of artificial skin.
Your sacrifice honors the Pairans and will be remembered throughout our history...
If we don't perish in the coming catastrophe.
Prepare yourself for the transmutation, then.
Mira.
Look at them.
Like to schoolgirls again.
It feels good to finally relax.
I believe the whole world has had quite an awakening.
Whatever they were, they were certainly not satellites.
It is terrible to think one of those creatures appeared in Bansyu-Mal.
I cannot stop wondering
What became of those UFOs?
Why were they here?
I wish I knew.
Maybe they came to invade.
What?
And what would have become of Earth?
We would have be swept from space in seconds.
You may have too much imagination,
But for now we need not worry.
There are no more flying saucers.
You seem to be having fun.
It's good to hear you laugh.
The way they're carrying on
They must be reminiscing about their schoolboy pranks.
Looks like the youngsters are enjoying themselves, as well!
Isn't it beautiful?
Look at the colors!
What a beautiful day.
Yes it is.
Should we head back?
What is it?
Let's see.
- What happened?
- We found a body.
Excuse me, please.
- What happened?
- A lady drowned.
Wait... Isn't that Hikari Aozora?
- Hikari Aozora!
- Yes
Miss Aozora.
A few questions, please!
- It's important.
- Who are you?
I am a journalist.
You just died in Nikkou!
- I died?
- Yes!
Like one?
Thank you.
Apparently the girl remembers nothing at all.
She's even forgotten her name.
Classic symptoms of amnesia.
I feel sorry for her.
How can we discover her identity?
It will be very difficult if she doesn't even know.
We have room at our house.
Suppose she stays with us
Until we find out who she is?
What do you think?
What do I think about what?
Where are you going?
Initial phase of infiltration is a complete success.
Miss Kamura!
Mr. Isobe has left a message.
Stop by the tennis court on your way home.
Thank you very much.
Mr. Isobe, call it your home!
Thanks, going now.
Do not look around.
Just listen to me.
I've been sent down to assist you.
Soon others will be, as well.
Signal if you need us.
Right, I understand.
- Is everything alright?
- It was my father.
- He made a weird request.
- What was it?
- That woman...
- Who?
- The Jane Doe.
- Ah, Ginko-san?
Yes, Ginko.
Did you forget her name?
It was you who gave it to her.
He asked me to bring him
Ginko's cap and tennis racket.
- Why would he ask that?
- Want a drink?
Juice.
I do not understand.
He told me not to touch the handle of the racquet.
How strange.
- Sounds like a detective novel.
- Here she comes.
- Let's go home, Ginko.
- Okay.
The cap also.
Isn't that Hikari Aozora?
No, get away!
No, back up!
What? Where is she?
Can I have your autograph, please?
Dad, is there a problem?
- Something wrong with the racket?
- No. With that woman.
- Did something happen?
- Yes, I came about Ginko.
Her cap, dad.
Something very strange happened today.
What?
What happened?
I hit a lob far over Ginko's head and she jumped incredibly high and returned the shot. .
- And then?
- And then I saw her go through...
- A closed door without even opening it!
- Without opening it?
Yes.
I was right.
How did you get in?
Through the door.
Is that so?
- I didn't hear anything.
- You were concentrating.
What are you doing?
Destroying this horrible formula!
That's part of my research.
It does not concern you!
Not me, but it is of vital importance to the future of Earth.
What?
Do you mean you understand that formula?
Yes. It is element 101.
Urium.
With enough of this element you could blow up the Earth!
Who are you?
Humans are already threatened by the atomic bomb, and now you are creating something much more devastating.
My formula is for peace.
And anyway, it's still only theoretical.
And what business is it of...
Mr. Isobe just called.
He needs you at the observatory.
It sounded urgent.
Thank you.
Is there something wrong?
He hasn't told me anything, but I think it's about Ginko.
I have called so sit back and relax.
I came right over.
What's going on today?
Everyone is here.
I just witnessed something... something I do not understand.
Did something happen?
She took one look at my Urium formula and understood it completely.
I only just completed it!
- You mean the Jane Doe?
- Yes.
- That settles it. She is not human.
- What?
What day is today?
April Fool's?
I started thinking about this after she was found in the lake.
The doctor told me she had too many white blood cells to be alive.
And yet, she was fine.
But we can not rely only on one test.
Of course not. Look at this.
Fingerprints taken from her racket.
What do you think?
She does not have any fingerprints!
And if that were not enough, look at this.
It is a sample of sweat from her cap.
And this substance was found at Shibaura Pier.
What do you say?
They are exactly the same.
So dad, who is Ginko, really?
- An extraterrestrial.
- What?
It comes from another planet.
But when we examine the Solar System: Mars, Jupiter...
We've never found a trace of other forms of life...
When my son played tennis with her... it... he saw it jump higher than even a trained athlete could.
The gravity of its planet must be different from that of Earth.
It must have reached Earth in one of those UFOs.
All clues point to that.
Then an alien Ginko can transform into a human being?
I can think of no another possibility.
What's that?
Where did that sound come from?
There! Over there!
It's you!
You surmised correctly.
I am not a human being.
Then it's true!
You are not of Earth!
True. I come from a planet called Paira.
I am a Pairan.
Paira...
What name do we know it by?
Paira is unknown to the Earth.
We are on the far side of the Sun...
Opposite the Earth's orbit.
Why did you come to our planet?
From our planet, we saw many atomic clouds on Earth.
From your planet?
This is impossible.
No. Our civilization is far older than yours.
Thousands of years ago our satellites detected the presence of your Earth.
That alone shows how much more advanced we are.
This is incredible.
I can hardly believe it.
When you saw my formula,
How did you know it was for element 101?
Our scientists discovered it long ago, but it was too dangerous even in microscopic quantities
So we destroyed our research.
You Japanese who have been victims of a nuclear disaster should understand.
We developed a safer nuclear energy after our physicists discovered the more stable element 102.
But why have you come here?
- To save Earth from destruction.
- Destruction?
I do not exaggerate.
Unless we cooperate to prevent it...
Both our planets are doomed.
Long ago we fought as you do.
Our weapons became powerful enough to burn our planet to ashes.
War and aggression were banned.
And with unlimited safe power
Thanks to element 102,
Our culture leapt ahead immensely.
We began to examine the depths of space
And we found something terrible.
What was it?
Was it the catastrophe you spoke of?
Yes it was.
A runaway planet
From a distant solar system.
On a collision course with Earth.
But we believe that if
Pairans and Earthlings cooperate,
There is a chance we can avoid the collision.
Well...
What does one say when he learns of the end of the world?
There is one possible way out of this.
If you could induce the countries with nuclear weapons to launch a barrage, you may alter the course of the rogue planet.
Could it succeed?
Theoretically it should work.
But if Earth is obliterated
The debris will destroy Paira, as well.
News flash.
Today, Doctors Matsuda,
Kamura and Isobe have sent a request to the Council of Nations.
That they deploy their entire stockpile of nuclear weapons
For the purpose of saving lives, 
Rather than destroying them, 
To protect our Earth from total destruction. 
A rogue planet called 'R'
Is on course to collide with the Earth. 
This collision will take place within 90 days. 
To avoid it, 
The warheads will attempt to destroy R
or to divert its path. 
This warning was delivered to us by the Pairans, 
The alien race who have recently been seen by many
as they entered our atmosphere in their spacecraft. 
The planet has yet to be detected from Earth
but is being tracked by the Pairans. 
Sounds like a joke, to me.
What is a Paira?
I don't know but it sounds delicious.
Let's contact them!
Paira, Paira!
Paira!
Paira!
Paira!
Attention, please.
May I have your attention?
Gentlemen...
Unfortunately, the
World Council has rejected our request.
The reason is that they do not believe Paira exists.
Now, wait. Patience, please.
You have all witnessed the presence of the Pairans.
But other countries, and even some Japanese,
Do not believe in the reality of Planet R.
So first we need to convince the Japanese, before resubmitting our request.
And I'm sure with our nation behind us, it will be accepted.
My Pairan informant estimates that we will be able, within 15 days, to see Planet R from Earth.
PLANET R
APPROACHING EARTH
IS PLANET R REALLY THERE?
THE COUNCIL OF NATIONS
SILENT
CAN WE PREVENT THE APOCALYPSE?
NEARING THE END OF THE WORLD
TOMORROW, R WILL BE VISIBLE
THROUGH TELESCOPES
Tomorrow the planet should appear.
Is there any other course of action?
There is only one solution, nuclear warheads.
- Any news from other the countries?
- Not yet.
I think that once they're convinced the planet exists,
They will realize that ours is the only option.
And what if they do not?
Mankind will disappear forever.
Are you certain nothing else can be done?
A Japanese scientist has discovered an explosive greater than the H-bomb.
The H-bomb?
It was to be used as an energy source, not a weapon.
- What is his name?
- Dr. Eisuke Matsuda.
Have you seen this?
You're in the newspaper.
What does it say?
You discovered a weapon more powerful than a nuclear bomb.
That changes nothing.
It's too late.
We don't have the technical capability to build it.
It's purely theoretical.
A gentleman to see you, sir.
I said I do not want visitors.
Yes, but he says it is very important.
Who is he?
- His card says George Saito.
- George?
- Very well. See him in.
- Yes, sir.
I just can't sit around here.
I'm going to the observatory.
Bring the car around, please.
Have a seat.
Please be brief, I haven't much time.
Okay, I'll try.
- What is it?
- It's about your formula.
I'd like to buy it.
What?
Buy my formula?
I'm offering a great deal of money.
Who are you?
- Consider me a friend.
- Why do you want my formula?
- Many countries want to buy it.
- You would betray Japan?
- I did not say that I was Japanese.
- Then what are you?
- I've already said, I'm a friend.
- Get out!
I do not need friends.
I have no time for you.
- If you refuse, you'll regret it.
- Get out of my house now!
We shall meet again.
- Who was that man?
- The devil.
Attention, please. 
The day has arrived. 
Stand by for a report from the Observatory. 
I see it!
They've spotted it!
Please, you cannot enter.
Isobe.
Attention. The body is moving at a high speed.
This is the proof we needed, Mom.
Yes, this is Tokyo calling.
Is this Sydney Observatory?
- Yes.
- Yes, I've got it. 
- How it's coming?
- Yes, we just saw. It's coming!
Yes. Yes, I've got it.
Yes.
Doctor, how soon before we collide?
Within 50 days. But the world will be scorched long before that.
Could we survive underground?
That would only delay the outcome.
Without those warheads there will be no survivors.
Why not use the atomic bombs?
It's insane to save for them war!
Do not abandon us!
Launch them now!
Get rid of them all!
News Flash. 
Foreign agencies have informed us
that the defense ministries have convened in emergency session
to reconsider Japan's proposal to use bombs against R. 
Two worlds are depending on their choice!
Attention! As chief of police,
I shall issue orders
To begin the evacuation of Tokyo.
The basement of the observatory is too small to accommodate the parents.
We understand, but thank you for taking our son.
We're grateful that he'll be safe.
- Okay, come with me.
- Thank you.
Heed the teacher and behave yourself.
- Thank you.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye. We love you!
- Goodbye.
Be careful.
Doctor!
Speed has increased to 200 km per second.
I think... within two days, it will be visible without a telescope.
- Any news from abroad?
- No.
- Soon we'll have to go down to the basement.
- Yes.
Let's begin moving all the important documents.
What do you want?
Who is it?
Let go. Let go!
Who are you?
Be quiet.
You!
Nice to see you again.
- What do you want from me?
- To reconsider my offer.
No way, you bastard!
This is kidnapping.
Kidnapping?
You misunderstand.
I'm trying to do you a favor.
Aren't you sick of being a poor scientist?
Accept my money and you will be rich.
Return me to my house.
I have work to do!
We'll return you once you've given me the formula.
Unless you can fly, you can not escape.
I will not give you the formula under any circumstances.
Do not want them to hurt you?
The formula is useless.
Soon we will all be dead.
Do what you want.
I do not think your formula is useless.
Nor do my clients.
Make him talk.
Carefully, children.
Walk down slowly, one at a time.
Really?
Right. I understand.
Matsuda left to come here hours ago.
Where can he be?
If the Council of Nations rejects the request again
Matsuda's new element 101 is our only hope.
But according to him, we lack the ability to actually produce it.
Quick, someone help me!
Hand me that!
Here!
Where can my husband be?
Do not worry.
He must be at another shelter.
That's it.
Okay, children, everything's alright now.
Let's pick up these papers.
Doctor!
- Come quick!
- What's happening?
It's accelerating again!
Quick!
Over here!
Radiation: - 15.
- How much time do we have now?
- We have only 20 days.
What do we do?
We can only wait until other countries are decided.
News Flash. 
The World Council has reversed its decision. 
Today at 20 hours, 
All Earth's nuclear bombs will be launched against Planet R. 
At last!
Listen! We're saved!
Tonight, all countries will they launch their warheads at R.
- Hurray!
- Hurray!
Hurray!
Alright, time for your nap.
What do you see?
Doctor, what have you seen?
The planet is too big.
The bombs did not work.
She was so beautiful that the prince kissed her, and suddenly she awoke.
The prince asked for her hand.
And they got married, and lived happily ever after
Until the end of their days.
Did you like it?
Ok, now time for sleep.
We have a big problem.
The atomic bombs did not destroy the planet.
Radiation has doubled.
How much time do we have?
Only 5 days.
Doctor, doctor! He's passed out!
Doctor!
- Are you all right, doctor?
- Yes, yes.
- What's wrong?
- Rats, there are rats!
OBSERVATORY
It's so hot!
Do not cry, be brave.
I'll sing a song, okay?
If only we had Matsuda's Urium.
Greetings.
Do not abandon hope.
Where is Dr. Matsuda?
He's been missing for days.
Never fear, Doctor. We'll find him.
Just how will you be able to do that?
Doctor Matsuda is wearing one of our rings.
The ring contains a communication device.
He will be visible on our radar.
Doctor, are you okay?
We need your Urium to save the Earth.
Please give us the formula.
Matsuda...
Where are you?
Don't cry, we'll be okay.
Matsuda!
- Dr. Matsuda!
- Doctor!
Matsuda!
They found him!
Sit.
People of Earth. People of Earth. 
The Urium bomb of Dr. Matsuda's has been built on our ship.
We are preparing to launch. 
The weapon is ready.
Please observe Planet R.
Come on!
THE END
Today, new dangers face mankind.
Dangers which challenges life, threaten it's very existence.
Sound frequencies have been found that can penetrate the human brain and destroy life.
Deadly isotopes of unknown elements have been discovered.
That can burn and sear the flesh.
Pilotless aircraft crashing the sonic barrier can gain complete mastery over the skies.
To meet this challenge to our existence a new agency has been formed.
O.S.I:
The Office of Scientific investigation.
The operatives of O.S.I are called A-Men.
A-Men, sounds like the final word of a prayer.
It is not.
"A" stands for Atom and "Atom" stands for power.
Power man has unleashed but has not yet learned to control.
Whirling in space, each atom is a solar system unto itself.
When studies separately, it's gamma rays yield information useful in the experiments carried on by the technicians at O.S.I
Our equipment covers the range of instruments
From the simple test tube to the complex 50,000 Volt Electron Microscope.
A-Men are detectives with degrees in science.
The criminals we seek are sometimes invisible to the human eye
Like radiation from outer space, or particles held prisoner deep in the heart of the atom.
Infinitesimal, yet within this tiny molecule there's a tremendous force that once unlocked can create or destroy planets.
Our Earth, is a planet.
July 18,
The morning, calm, quiet, peaceful.
I reported for work as usual at
8:55am.
My name is Stewart,
Jeff Stewart.
Class of 39, M.I.T, Boston, Mass.
I'm in charge of research at O.S.I.
The world seemed safe and good.
Bye, honey.
I'll pick you up at six.
Eh, what is this, a brush off?
Didn't I buy you dinner and flowers and breakfast?
Jeff, you're late, and I'm a married woman.
Are you?
You don't act that way at all.
There's lipstick on your nose.
Very undignified for a man of science.
Call me as soon as you've seen the doctor, will you?
It's nothing honey, just a routine check up.
I want to know why you're so skinny.
Other girls are fat in their 4th month.
- They aren't.
- And don't do any housework.
Heavens, no! The upstairs maid and the butler will do it all.
- I mean it! See you at six.
- Bye.
RESEARCH
Yes General, Doctor Allard's in.
I'm connecting you.
- Good morning Dr. Stewart.
- Morning Nelly.
Dr. Forbes is waiting for you he'd like you to come in to the lab, he says it's urgent. -Ok.
- Hey Nelly...
- Yes Dr Stewart.
- You've got children, haven't you?
- A boy and a girl.
Were you skinny in your 4th month?
I was never skinny.
Office of Scientific investigation...
- Morning Dan.
- Hi.
Jeff, when was the last atomic test at Las Vegas?
Couple of months ago, why?
Would you mind checking these here samples for me please?
Sure.
- What's the trouble?
- I'll show you.
2280 disintegrations per minute.
Much higher than yesterday's concentration.
- Could there be something wrong with the counter?
- No, I checked it.
Let's have another sample.
2360 disintegrations per minute.
Traces of radioactive dust.
Hand me that pad, will you.
Average disintegrations per minute 2300.
- What time is it?
- Exactly 9 O'clock.
- Good morning Mr. Simon.
- Morning.
Albert!
- Yes Mr. Simon?
- Look, the clocks.
I am an orderly man,
I'm running an orderly store.
It's 9 O'clock now and our clocks say it's 12 minutes past 12.
I don't get it.
You don't get a lot of things, like a raise for instance.
It's my duty to pay your wages, and it's your duty to wind the clocks.
But I wound them!
- Customers don't buy clocks that show the wrong time.
I wound all the clocks last night!
The electric clock has Mr Simon...
12 minutes past 12.
- There must have been a power failure.
- Try the lights.
- Well the lights are working.
- Well then the clocks ought to work too.
- Yes but they don't.
- Mr. Simon!
Mr. Simon!
- Mr. Simon!
- What's this?
- It's stuck!
- It's not stuck, it's magnetised.
Mr Simon, there are magnetised too!
- But I can't understand it.
- My wristwatch has stopped.
- Mine too!
- Mine still shows 9, that's the time entered the store.
Look!
Someone is wrecking my store with magnetic power.
- Magnetic power?
- We must call the police!
Hello operator?
Give me the Department of Power and Light.
Immediately! This is an emergency, do you understand, an emergency!
Engineer Watson speaking.
Yes, I'm the chief Engineer.
Simon's Hardware store,
918 Lincoln?
Yes, I know where that is.
What's that?
Well you must have a powerful magnet in your store. You haven't?
I can't have appliances sailing around my store.
Listen Mr Simon, I have no time for practical jokes.
But I am a taxpayer, do you understand? I insist!
Alright, alright Mr Simon, I'll have somebody over there right away.
918 Lincoln.
Office of Scientific investigation?
Connect me with Dr Allard please.
This is the office of power and light.
Watson speaking.
Say Doctor, directive 149, says that if anything unusual happens to contact your office immediately.
I think you'd better send a couple of your A-Men over to Simon Hardware...
Well I'm glad you got here, my name is Simon I am the proprietor.
I'm Dr. Stewart.
This is Dr. Forbes, my assistant.
What seems to be the trouble?
This.
When did you first notice these magnetic effects?
When I first entered the store.
All of the clocks stopped last night at 12 past 12.
I am answering the questions..
Could I have a piece of stiff paper please.
- Er thank you, and some small tacks.
- Er, Joy?
Thank you..
- This proves our point Mr Simon.
- What point?
See if we can find out where it comes from. Yeh, that's a good one.
That'll do it.
- The epicentre is up there.
- Epicentre?
What do you keep up there Mr Simon?
There's nothing to do with the store, they're offices.
What would you say Dan?
Paramagnetic forces, no doubt about it.
Get the prober for me, will you?
Could I use one of those fish poles?
- Albert.
- Yes sir.
No no, not a metal one, the bamboo.
Thank you.
There's a bomb in there,
I can hear it tick!
- This isn't a bomb, it's a Gieger Counter.
-Why does it tick?
The clicking noise shows the presence of radiation.
Radiation?
Small frequency indicates it's not dangerous, yet.
- We'd better put the badges on though.
- Alright.
What's this all about, where does the magnetism come from?
Radiation definitely emanating from the
2nd floor, wouldn't you say Dan?
Yes, I imagine just overhead.
- What are those things for?
- Photographic plates.
Any radiation will expose them.. We want to know how much radiation we absorb.
This store was founded in 1905,
Now we handle the most modern equipment.
But nothing like this has ever happened here before.
Nelly, connect me with Dr. Allard please.
- Yes?
- Dr. Stewart on 4.
Yes Jeff?
Well I don't see how that's possible?
Must be Para-Magnetism.
Have you found the source?
No sir, not yet, not definitely.
Well get into your protective clothing at once.
Yes sir, we have protective clothing in the car.
I'll get police help to you as soon as I can.
Now here's what I want you to do...
Yes, yes sir I understand.
Right chief.
- What did he say?
- To wait for the police to surround the block.
The Police?
We'll use every means at our disposal to recover the radioactive matter.
Police will be instructed to shoot to kill.
Come on, let's go.
- 320 milliroentgens.
- We're getting hot alright.
Beta rays increasing.
Jeff. You remember Newbold's theory of unipole magnetism?
Sure, heavy element out of equilibrium.
Only one pole, North or South.
Defies gravitation. Why?
You suppose that this could be it?
Stick close to me.
Sounds like a machine gun.
This place is really loaded.
Must be right here.
Come here.
Overdose of radiation.
Must have been dead for hours.
Wonder who he is?
Find out that out later.
Jeff the impulses don't seem to be dying down..
Emanations constant.
420 'MR'.
There must be another strong source of radioativity around here somewheres..
Here it is!
Empty. It isn't there any more.
It must have contained a very heavy element. Heavier than Uranium.
It must have been pretty close to an explosive stage too.
Strong enough to kill.
Or wipe out a few city blocks.
Jeff, being magnetic..
It must be showing up on TV screens, interfering with radar.
Right.
Whatever it is, it can't hide from us.
- Come on, let's get going.
- Right.
Forbes and I went back, checked the hardware store with special equipment.
Then returned to O.S.I.
We didn't know where the element was, but we knew it would strike again.
We tried to get ready for it.
Though our clues were pathectically few.
The Speed of an Alpha particle is between
9 and 20,000 miles a second.
Applying standard procedure..
We measured the speed and distance of the radioactive particles emitted by the empty container we'd found in the attic.
Next we analysed dust particles and finger nail scrapings taken from the dead man.
Without a sample of the element itself, we could only hope for the best.
From the film plate of the spectrum of an element
It is possible with amazing accuracy to obtain the isotopes' unit charge and atomic weight of a substance.
The Spectrograph of our dust particles was carefully examined
But the test yielded results we'd never seen before.
In desperation we decided to submit our findings to the Electronic Brain.
Our calculations were forwarded by long distance telephone
Received by the input unit and automatically recorded for assimilation by The Brain.
While our findings were being coded and the computations punched on cards
The extensive library of every basic element and radioactive substance known to man was systematically examined.
If a similar element existed it would be found among the thousands of facts available to the machines that comprised the system known as 'The Maniac'.
Finally the tabulations were double-checked against our mathematical description of the element that had already taken the life of one man.
Unless we were able to stop it,
It's radioactivity would remain a constant threat.
Our problem was fed to 'The Brain'.
An automatically sequenced computer employing a high speed cathode ray memory unit.
'The Maniac' sings with weird voices when it is working.
But even under skilled guidance
It faltered and was silent.
Frustrated by an unknown element that could kill.
1.15 pm
Every means of communication was used to inform the city that a dangerously radioactive element was at large.
The public, and all federal and civilian agencies were instructed to report immediately any disturbances in home appliances radio, television,...
Radar Screens and scopes,...
High frequency equipment,
Telephone service,
Western Union facilities, and all types of electrical equipment.
Every 15 minutes Dr Allard and myself took turns broadcasting on the radio
Ladies and gentlemen..
We are conducting a scientific test
Please let us know at once
If any of your watches or clocks have been magnetic.
Should you discover any magnetism coming from metallic objects like your car, your toolbox, or your electrical equipments,
Call Ogden 22-22.
Ogden 22-22.
Yes, thank you.
Yes, I heard you.
I wrote it down.
You'll hear from us.
He says the battery of his hearing aid burned out and he wants us to look into the matter.
Oh fun.
What are these, more addresses?
- About 2 dozen.
- I've already checked 3 dozen.
Oh I'm worn in, done out, beat.
Dr. Forbes, Dr. Allard told me to give this to you.
Have the police get in touch with those people, Let them check the addresses.
And ehm, sweatheart keep the intercom switched on.
Your Television set doesn't work?
Where do you live?
What do they think we are?
Repairmen for broken down equipment?
Office of scientific Investigation.
- White spots on your TV screen?
- White spots? That cars going by.
- Anything significant?
- No. All blind alleys.
Teletype from Washington.
No Radioactive matter reported missing from any, from any plant.
Well that settles that.
Office of scientific Investigation.
- I drive a cab and I heard your broadcast.
- Yes? Please go on.
Look. I just dropped a fare at the airport but my cab acts kind of funny.
She stopped on me, won't start.
Listen to this.
I just got a brand new battery
I know about cars, checked her.
But she deader than a mackerel.
But we can't fix your cab.
Please call your garage.
- They wouldn't know what to do, the motor's froze. My screwdriver sticks to the block.
- His Motor's become magnetic.
- Yeh.
- This may be it.
- Nelly, switch his call in here.
Hello this is Dr. Stewart, speaking.
Where are you located?
At the airport, South gate.
Your Licence number?
- 7-Z-1456.
- 7-Z-1456.
Stay right where you are.
I'm coming out.
Stay where I am?
Are you kiddin'. I can't move!
Take a look at this Jeff.
Air terminal reports extreme interference radar and radio communication.
- Well that's it alright.
I'd better get out there.
- Right.
I'll call the airfield and tell the office you'll be there in 20 minutes.
- Report back if you need any assistance.
- Right, Chief. Dan, bring a Geiger counter.
Right, with you.
Dr Stewart called, don't forget you have a date with her tonight.
Call her and tell her not to leave the house. Tell her to stay at home.
I'm sorry, Nelly.
Please give her that message.
AIRPORT SUPERVISOR
- Where'd you pick him up?
- At 7th and Hill.
- What time was it when he left your cab?
- I don't know for sure, my watch stopped.
- He didn't say which plane he wanted to catch?
- No, but I got out of here about 5 O'clock..
We've had about 14 planes leave during that hour. That's a lot of planes to stop.
What'd he look like?
Well usually I don't take a good look at my fares in the daytime..
Of course at night it's different.
But he was no kid.
How old?
Oh, about 60.
He carried a large brown suitcase.
You know the kind of a case that opens on top, more like a brief case.
- It was pretty heavy.
- Did you lift it?
No, he wouldn't let me near it.
But I could tell it was heavy by the way he carried it.
He seemed nervous.
He fumbled when he kinda paid me the money, he put the case between his feet.
He seemed to be afraid somebody would steal it.
- Thats about all can remember.
- Yeh, alright thanks very much.
- Eh, what'd the old guy do, rob a bank?
- No, thanks for your help.
You never can tell what you get in a cab now a days. Yesterday a fella got in my hack with a Kangaroo.
You know, I quit driving a gasoline truck,..
Thought it was too dangerous.
What'd you want me to do?
Can you instruct all planes to land at the nearest airport?
I haven't got the authority.
Then get permission. All the planes would have reached their destination before I got through.
- All except one.
- After all there's a chance he didn't take a plane?
Now look, look. Very soon the airplane that he's in is going to crash.
How soon?
It all depends on how far the briefcase is from the motors.
What do you mean?
If he's sitting in one of the forward seats, the magnetism is going to take hold at any time and the motors are going to conk out.
If he's sitting back towards the tail, there may be some delay.
Now will you please put that order through? My responsibility!
Alright, I'll order all planes to land at the next emergency field.
Get me the Control Tower please.
- Jeff.
- Dan!
- I think I know which plane our man is on.
- Yeh, which one?
- We'll find out in a minute, come on quick!
- Coming, Mr. Smith?
Cancel the call please.
Excuse me please.
Jeff, check the counter.
- Wow, definitely radioactive!
- Our man took out an insurance policy.
- No wonder.
- But how do you know?
- Whatever blank he signed will be plenty hot.
This little machine is tracking him down like a bloodhound.
Getting warmer!
There it is.
Howard Denker, Flight 17.
- 17 took off at 5-0-5.
- Can I get 17 back to the field.
- Howard Denker, I know him he's a research physicist at South western.
- Yes, I've heard of him, come on.
Thankyou.
I love to fly.
It's the only sure cure for my hay fever.
I often take a trip just to stop it.
I never feel as well as in a plane!
I wrote to the company and suggested they have special flights called 'Hay fever rides'.
They'd make lots of money.
Say, are you sick?
Its, its the altitude.
- Anything wrong sir?
- No. No.
- Let me take your briefcase.
- No!
Don't touch it.
Wouldn't you like to sit further back.
You could rest better.
Leave me...
Leave me alone, will you...
Airport's calling.
Flight 17.
This is Flight 17, over.
Return to the airfield at once.
Your engines might quit at any moment.
What does he mean 'engines might quit'?
That's the starboard engine.
Tell them we're coming back.
Captain, we've got a sick man onboard, his gums are bleeding.
Received message, returning.
Starboard engine cutting out.
Have sick man aboard, over.
He's suffering from radiation sickness.
Isolate him from the other passengers
His briefcase contains dangerous radioactive material.
Push it as far back towards the tail of the aircraft as you possibly can..
Don't touch it with your hands.
Repeat.
Do not touch it with your hands.
An ambulance and decontamination squad will standby at the airfield.
Hope your engines will make it.
Good luck.
Over and out.
Take over.
- Good thing we're not over the Rockies.
- I'll take care of that briefcase.
- This man here.
- Ok, get away from him till
I can move that briefcase.
Excuse me, eh, I've got to borrow your cane.
Just, just keep in your seats folks. Don't be alarmed, everything will be alright
Fasten your seatbelts please.
We're going to make a landing.
Everything will be alright.
Alright, keep your seats folks.
Keep your seats, you'll be told when you can leave the plane.
It'll be just a few minutes.
- Where is it Captain?
- Right back there Sir.
Come on.
- Now where's the sick man?
- Up in front on the right.
Doctor!
Folks you may leave now but please file out slowly.
And let the passengers at the rear of the plane come out first.
Ar, you first mamm.
Well, what's that for?
You'd better let the stewardess take you to the hospital mamm, for a check up.
- Hospital? I'm not sick!
- This way please.
Dr. Denker?
I'm Dr Stewart of the Office of Scientific Investigations.
Its, it's in my briefcase.
Just a minute sir, please.
I'm afraid we'll have to take this cane away from you sir.
- Would you help him out please?
- What is it Dr Denker?
Sereneum. A comparatively harmless matter when I received it.
What'd you do to it?
I kept bombarding it with
Alpha particles.
For 200 hours.
It changed it's properties.
It became unipolar, magnetic.
Why didn't you report it?
I didn't want to have any interference with my experiment.
I was afraid that others might share my discovery.
Why'd you take that laboratory on Lincoln Street?
I wanted to work unobserved with my assistant.
But that Sereneum...
Turned out to be, unstable.
When my assistant was killed...
I tried to take it back to the laboratory.
At the University.
I'm still in full possession of my mental faculties..
I still know what I'm saying.
Remember this, Stewart.
Keep it under constant electric charge.
Electric charge? Why?
It's hungry. It has to be fed constantly.
Or it will reach out it's magnetic arm..
And grab at anything within it's reach, and kill it!
It's monstrous, Stewart.
Monstrous!
It grows bigger, and bigger.
- How can it be stopped?
- I don't know.
Other scientists... will have to find the solution.
My contribution... is finished.
I know this:
In nuclear research there's no place for lone wolves.
Specially trained technicians from the State University prepared to receive the element being transported ascross the field under Police Guard.
Every precaution was taken by the men who would accompany the element on it's long journey, but even then, we failed to realise the power of
Denker's creation.
The element was reaching out with invisible fingers gripping metallic objects with terrifying strength
We had no time to consider the reason for
Denker's experiment or what he had hoped to accomplish. Our main concern was to remove the element from the airfield as soon as we could.
Working as quickly as possible the technicians opened Denker's briefcase.
Using non-magnetic tools
They carefully removed the cylinder containing the new element and transferred it to a case made of special alloys, designed to prevent the spread of radioactive particles.
The Guards had not been required to wear protective clothing due to their brief exposure to the element.
Yet they shared our relief in the fact that the element was in a double container.
For added protection, a special lead-lined truck had been provided to contain any stray radiation, while the element was en route to it's destination
The Cyclotron at the State University.
Denker was right.
In Nuclear research there is no place for lone wolves.
July 19th.
Forbes and I had installed the element in it's new home in the Cyclotron of the
State university,
It was early morning by the time we'd been checked through radiation quarantine and had made our report to Dr. Allard.
As I approached home, and Connie,
Denker's dying words kept ringing in my ears
"It will reach out with it's magnetic arms.."
"and grab anything within it's reach, and kill it."
Jeff, is that you Jeff?
Were you expecting somebody else?
You've been away for days.
Don't I rate a kiss?
What kind of husband are you?
The kind, kind. I wouldn't kiss any girl with these whiskers on my face.
Not even my own wife.
- Why didn't you call me?
- You know what time it is?
- No.
- 6.30 am.
Oh darling,
This is the most beautiful bedroom in the world.
Hey, what the doctor say?
When are you gonna start getting fat?
- He said not for a while.
- Yeh, how long a while?
He said some women never get fat until the last 2 days. I may be the type.
He doesn't know anything about babies.
Today, we're gonna look for a house.
What?
I'm gonna take the day off.
Jeff we can't afford a house!
Our boy is gonna have a real patch of grass and
Sunshine and a real tree to climb in.
I was brought up in an apartment and I was a very healthy child.
Skinny.
4th month and still skinny!
- I am not skinny!
- I ought to know.
He's gonna have a patch of real green grass.
You must be dead tired you poor darling.
From now on I'm the boss.
We're gonna buy a house and you're gonna be fed under my personal supervision.
- Medical science says in the 4th month...
- And I say..
Hot cakes, syrup, sausage, white bread
- If you say so.
- I say so.
Police cars with loud speakers, television announcements
I tell you for 24 hours I was the most important guy in this town.
Of course you're a very important person.
You've saved many many lives and I'm sure they'll give you a medal, but never a raise.
We can buy that house without a raise.
That element, that Dan and you recovered?
Where'd you take it?
To the State University for observation.
I'm through with it thank heaven.
Now let me see,
We've got 3,000...
- 3,000 in the bank.
Alright, alright, alright..
A 1,000 dollars for a down payment on a GI house.
- Money for the hospital.
- Yeh, I figure on 300.
Figure on 500.
And we need a nurse for a few days who can cook.
I can cook.
1,000 dollars for a down payment on the furniture.
But darling, we're not figuring on having twins.
Well, what about carpets, drapes?
We don't want the neighbours looking into our living room.
What we need is a patch of grass, a backyard with a few miles of sunshine above it. The rest will take care of itself slowly.
Very slowly.
Say, what happens if you're transferred to another place?
You're a Government employee.
And portable.
Darling, stop worrying.
Now look!
You've eaten all your pancakes.
We'll have a fat sassy baby.
You just let me handle things and everything'll work out.
- I married a genius.
- And a great lover.
Huh!
Don't answer it, please Jeff. Remember you're taking the day off to look for a house with a backyard..
A patch of grass and a mortgage.
Hello?
Oh yes Dr. Allard.
What?
Yes sir, I'll be right over.
There was an explosion at the University.
How bad?
Very!
Dr. Chase was killed.
- And Freddy Lipton. You know Freddy.
- Well that's terrible.
It was that same thing that killed Dr.
Denker.
- Oh Jeff...
- I know, I'll be careful.
I've gotta come back to both of you.
8:16 am.
The Score: 4 murders in 2 days.
Cause of death, the element was hungry.
When I arrived at the Office of Scientific investigation
The entrance was blocked
The autogates shut. There'd never been a reason to evacuate the entire area before.
Apparently the guard at the gate knew less about it than I did.
Inside the corridor was empty, the desks deserted.
It gave an eerie sombre feeling to O.S.I.
We received the element from your office and treated it as highly explosive matter.
Unfortunately the instructions we received did not prevent the disaster.
Gentlemen meet Dr Stewart.
Captain Dryer, of the department of civilian defence
- Dr. Serny, of State university
- Oh yes, how do you do.
Dr. Stewart,
Can you give us an explanation?
First I need an explanation Colonel.
Why the roadblock?
Why the explosion?
- It wasn't an explosion.
- That building collapsed on the Campus.
A Cyclotron that Government funds helped pay for out of tax payer's money was smashed to smitheerines.
- What do you call that if not an explosion?
- Nonsense gentlemen!
It was an inverted explosion.
An implosion.
The walls were pulled inward by some unbelievable force.
Girders were bent,
Rivets were pulled out...
All metal parts within a radius of 100 yards became magnetic.
Look, Colonel.
This is a bolt from one of the girders.
Now watch.
Why, I've never seen anything like that in my life!
What is that?
A piece of steel has been magnetised by some radioactive element.
So far, undefined.
We placed it in our vacuum chamber.
Forbes is watching it.
Oh it's quiet now but heavenly only knows when it will react again.
But you have no right to keep a highly dangerous substance in the centre of the City!
My instructions are to find out what it is.
What happens if it explodes again, while you do your research?
Then captain, it becomes the responsibility of our successors.
Dr. Serny,...
Did you, did you notice any difference in the element after the implosion?
Yes.
Its hard to say because it's so hard to believe.
It defies every law of physics.
It doubled it's size...
Then lost it's magnetism and it's radioactivity.
Denker was right.
It's unipolar magnetic.
Constantly growing, doubling it's mass.
Growing larger and larger.
But this is ridiculous, metal objects can't grow!
- Yes?
- This is Forbes. I'm ready with the samples.
We'll be over right away..
We'll examine the element under the electronic microscope. Will you gentlemen please follow me.
Turn out the light Captain, please..
Maximum vacuum, Dr. Stewart.
It's Extraordinary!
Look, they're multiplying.
They're forming rings of their own.
Adding new structure to the old.
Doubling their size.
Growing larger and larger.
You know what's happening?
Mass is forming in supposedly empty space!
I don't follow.
Energys' being drawn into space transforming itself into mass.
What does it mean?
They're like planets.
This process might have been the origin of the solar system.
Yes, gentlemen.
We're witnessing the secret of creation..
Diameter of the molecule:
45 thousandths of one millimetre.
Cycle of multiplication:
4 seconds and 4 tenths.
This growing process follows a straight mathematical progression.
- It's amazing.
- Amazing to me we didn't explode.
What's next?
We'll run the tests and communicate the data to "Maniac".
- Who's the 'Maniac'?
- M.A.N.I.A.C.,
Mathematical Analyser Numerical
Integrator and Computer.
- You mean the giant brain machine?
- 'MANIAC', in short.
With a sample of the element to work with at last..
We began a series of exhaustive tests.
Our first move was to check it's chemical composition,
Critical mass, density and point of saturation.
Measuring the emission of it's Alpha and Beta particles was almost beyond the scope of the
Geiger Counter's scaling unit.
But testing it under extremely high frequencies we were able to ascertain the exact strength of it's magnetic field.
The response of the element bore out Denker's statement.
It was of a highly unstable nature
Its wavelength yielded frequencies well above 2 million megacycles per second.
Intense heat enabled us to photograph it's spectrum, and three hours later we had compiled all the information possible.
Our next step was to consult the M.A.N.I.A.C.
At last we were coming close to a true picture..
Of the monster Denker had blundered into existence.
The problems are broken down in code..
You must feed them, to the computer as soon as possible and teletype us the results.
There can't be any delay.
The total problem, data as follows...
Energy: 0011.
Time of Cycle: 1001.
Atomic weight: 10011.
Radiation: 10100.
Last minute preparations were made.
Our coded results were checked, and re-checked.
Finally, everything was ready.
The computer was awakened from it's slumber, and the data fed into the brain of the M.A.N.I.A.C.
It was a matter of time, until whether we would know
Whether we had succeeded or failed.
This is worse than waiting for a baby.
It's almost 6. I've got to relieve Dan in the vacuum chamber.
I'll call you as soon as I get the information from the M.A.N.I.A.C.
Ok, chief.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Brought you some Java.
- Yo!
- Nothing yet?
- No.
- Any word from the M.A.N.I.A.C?
- Not yet.
Jeff, what do you think?
I don't dare say it.
- Afraid?
- Sure, aren't you?
What's that?
Dan, Look!
Magnetic field's increasing!
It's actually growing!
Jeff, that's alive thing!
If it's growing it's feeding on something.
And if it's not being fed..
It implodes and draws energy from surrounding matter.
And turns that into mass.
Nuclei and electrons form matter.
Let's feed that thing electrons, it's our only chance Dan, let's try it.
Increase the voltage.
Go on give it more.
Give it maximum output.
That's it.
Jeff, look.
It's quiet again.
Yeh, for the time being.
- Serny was right.
- About what?
It's doubled it's size.
And it's appetite.
Yes?
Right chief.
Allen's got the M.A.N.I.A.C on the wire, give me my coat.
Here it is gentlemen.
Energy gained per cycle
500 Million Hertz.
Unstable. Unipolar.
Cycles of Implosion: 11 hours.
It will double it's size every 11 hours.
The last implosion was at
7 O'clock this morning.
- The next one is due at 6 O'clock.
- 6.30 now.
There you are, the whole thing is a miscalculation.
No captain.
There was an implosion at 6, but we stopped it.
And there'll be another one at 5 in the morning, only double it's size.
Gentlemen we have 10 hours and 30 minutes.
While Forbes kept watch on the element, I attended an all night session at City Hall.
Scheduled implosion at 5 the next morning
Would be met with all the available power in the city
Radio and TV stations remained on the air
To inform the public that a special test was to be made the following morning.
Ladies and gentlemen,
In 10 minutes we're suspending our telecast for a period of 30 minutes.
The Department of Power and Light informed us that the City will go dark for a half hour.
We tried to contact the Mayor's office but we were refused explanation.
Gentlemen, as Mayor of this city,
You see what I'm up against!
Mr Mayor the City must go dark to supply the power we need.
And after 11 hours, what then?
Then we'll need the entire power of Bolder Dam to feed it.
We must make preparation to evacuate the city.
How can we evacuate 4 million people in a few hours?
What's the limit of it's growth?
There is no limit, General.
It'll grow larger and larger.
- Doubling it's size with each cycle.
- But what would happen?
Look.
As long as the earth remains in
Equilibrium, nothing will change.
But very soon, this element is going to make the Earth eccentric,
It's gonna fly out of it's orbit.
Into space!
You can't be serious?
Mr Mayor, we're stating facts.
How large is our supply of electricity?
600,000 kilowatts for the whole city.
Well let's shoot it into space.
Far as I know Sir, we don't possess a rocket that powerful.
What about dumping it into the ocean?
In a matter of weeks the ocean would turn into steam.
Isn't there some way to stop it's growth?
Yes, Mr Mayor, theoretically.
If we could use it's own power, bombard it with that power, over feed it until it burst, and fissioned into 2 stable elements
You mean elements that are not cancerous?
How many volts would it take to split it?
According to the M.A.N.I.A.C, ,
900 million Volts..
- There isn't a generator that powerful.
- That's right.
Wait!
The Canadian Government operate a top secret plant in Nova Scotia
They own the most powerful
Deltatron in existence.
When they realise the common danger, they'll let us use it
Nova Scotia is 4000 miles away.
The period between cycles is 11 hours.
How are we going to transport it there in that time?
Our jets travel at 600 miles an hour.
And what's more the new alloys we use in our jets are non-magnetic.
They'll not be affected by the cargo.
You Dr. Stewart and Forbes can follow in another plane, just in case.
Operator, This is General Behan.
Give me Washington,
Connect me with the
Secretary of Defence.
I like this world.
Let's keep it in one piece.
Or at least let's try.
July 21, 7.45am.
We had sapped the strength of the city to keep a monster alive.
The element had been fed, and for the time being was at rest.
The Air Command supplied us with Jet Aircraft,
One for Forbes and myself, and one for the element.
It had quadrupled it's size and due to it's increasing density, we were no longer able to extract a sample even for test purposes.
A new cylinder had been fashioned from a combination of special alloys.
We were able to contain the strength of the element's magnetic field and lessen the degree of it's radiation but like a chained beast it had the power to break lose in an unpredictable frenzy.
The element was loaded into the plane for the trip that we hoped would carry it to final and total destruction.
Forbes and I had already taken off in the jet bomber that had been placed at our disposal by the Air Command.
Ours was a fast ship, but no match for the pursuit job that was to carry the element to its destination.
By placing the element in the plane,
The technicians from State university had fulfilled their end of the bargain.
The rest was up to the pilot.
8:43 am, the element was airborne.
We'd made countless tests with the monster Denker had created,
But we didn't know how it would react to the sudden acceleration of a jet fighter plane.
Fortunately, or unfortunately,
The pilot would be the only one who could tell us.
The fighter had dropped it's wing tanks and prepared to take on fuel while in flight to save the one important factor, time.
If the element was hungry,
It would have to wait until the fighter quenched it's thirst.
Our bomber was next.
Finally our tanks were full.
Time: 11:51.
Destination: Nova Scotia.
What we'd do there we didn't know for sure.
If we got there, we had exactly
1 hour and 35 minutes to find out.
- They're here, the Americans.
- I hope they know what they're doing.
- Dr. Benton?
- Yeh, this way.
That's a hot potato you tossed us!
I read you report you sent over by Teletype.
- I must say I am quite at a loss.
- That's why we're here Dr. Benton.
- How far down are you taking us?
- 1700 feet.
This is an old mine. The Government put us down here in the interests of public safety.
I've studied the specifications of your Deltatron Dr.
I hope it's powerful enough to do the job.
What is the nature of your job?
What's the maximum output of your machine, your specifications didn't state it?
600 million Volt maximum.
That's all?
The insulators haven't been tested for more.
We haven't time left to run a test.
- It's cold down here!
- Yes, we're under the ocean floor.
It's the deepest mineshaft we could find. Just perfect for our purpose.
- Safety reasons?
- Only partly.
The sea water's almost at freezing point down here.
We need it to cool the Deltatron.
Nice to see the sun again.
Patch of grass.
For 11 years I've practically lived in this hole under the Ocean Dr Stewart..
Yes Dr. Benton I'm familiar with your work.
Then you can understand my apprehension, and curiosity.
How do you plan to use my Deltatron?
I'm going to try to kill that thing we sent you.
- How you going about it?
- Choke it.
- I don't follow you.
- It feeds on energy.
Our only chance it to over-feed it.
Ram all available, power down it's throat.
Choke it to death.
But if it can assimilate all the energy?
What then?
I'll leave that to your imagination.
Open the floodgate.
The Deltatron is beyond those doors.
Safety checks begin?
Just in case an explosion should blow through the floor of the Ocean sometime.
They're watertight.
She's a brute ain't she?
Took 11 years to build her.
You say the maximum load would be
600 million Volts.
That's the upper limit, although we've never been that high.
It's not high enough then.
The Deltatron has an output of 600 million Volts.
That will be the upper limit of your operating conditions.
- Mind if I have a look?
- Go ahead.
But I don't understand.
What's he got on his mind
How much voltage is he gonna use?
We consulted The M.A.N.I.A.C..
Here's the answer.
But this is preposterous!
This is impossible
I don't think the M.A.N.I.A.C made a mistake.
I don't question the M.A.N.I.A.C but at this high voltage, the...
Molecular movement can't be controlled.
There's no way of directing it.
Do you have a better plan?
What's up there?
It's the Tele-metering Control Room.
I'd better talk to the Defence Minister.
I won't take any responsibility for the safety of the people and the equipment.
But I must repeat their lives are in danger.
Very well Sir.
I understand.
- Cartwright here.
- Cartwright.
Yes Sir?
Tell the Crew that Dr. Stewart is in full charge.
- They'll take orders from him.
- Yes Sir.
Stewart,..
How can you take such a personal risk?
I'm gonna set the machine and leave in time.
- So are the men.
- But she isn't built to take such a load!
- She'll break up!
Dr. Benton,
Our only hope is that she'll break that element before she breaks herself.
Start your Generators.
Cut in Emergency Voltage when called for.
Stand clear of the machine.
I'm gonna see how much it can take.
I'm now going to set the Deltatron at it's maximum output, and close the flood gates.
I want you all to leave. You've got about 7 minutes to reach the surface.
- What about you?
- I'll get out in time too.
The flood gates will hold no matter what happens. You'll be safe the other side of them.
I'm now going to close those Gates.
You can't do that, you can't do that!
Benton, what are you doing up here?
This is about listening to reason, it's insanity what you're doing!
Get out of here Benton,
I'm gonna close those Gates.
But I implore you listen to me.
Lock the remote controls and come on down!
Come back cowards!
You know it can't be stopped now.
Come on, get out of here.
Now you'll have to stop the Generators!
You'll have to!
You'll drown.
You and 400 men!
All of you!
The doors won't close, stay alive!
Get out!
Give me your big cutters!
- Listen?
- Yeh.
Sill alive.
- It's the end.
- Come on.
We did it, Dan.
We killed it!
It's gone.
It's gone forever.
Hey! Not so skinny.
- I'm working on it,
I'm getting bigger and better.
- The Secret of multiplication.
- What are you talking about?
I'm not sure.
Excepting they both seem to have something to do with multiplication.
Done through love the result is a baby, a lovely thing.
But without love, and through hate or with fear,
The result is a Monster.
An element that grows.
Jeff.....

    WHERE HE WAS FOUND.         
WAS IT YOUR TRUCK               
THAT MADE THESE TRACKS?         
            MUST HAVE.          
        I HAD 2 NEW RETREADS    
        LIKE THAT ON THE REAR.  
UH-HUH.                         
CAME DOWN THE ROAD,             
THEN GOT STUCK.                 
            YEAH. THEN          
            WHERE'D IT GO?      
STRAIGHT UP IN THE AIR,         
IT LOOKS LIKE.                  
        LOOK, THAT TRUCK HAD    
        A RADIO AND A HEATER,   
            BUT IT DIDN'T       
            HAVE WINGS.         
        NOW, ARE YOU GONNA FIND 
        IT OR AREN'T YOU?       
LOOK, SEÑOR.                    
I AM JUST                       
A COUNTRY POLICEMAN.            
 I AM PAID                      
 TO KEEP THE PEACE.             
IF SOMEONE STEALS,              
I TRY TO CATCH THE THIEF        
AND PUT HIM IN JAIL,            
LIKE IT SAYS                    
IN THE BOOK.                    
BUT ABOUT THIS, SEÑOR,          
I DON'T KNOW.                   
THE BOOK DOESN'T                
SAY ANYTHING                    
ABOUT A THING

MR. SWANSON SAYS

TO KID ME?

        MY BROTHER.             
                HE GOT          
                A BAD DOSE      
                OF RADIATION    
                POISONING       
                IN THE COURSE   
                OF TESTING      
            A PLUTONIUM BOMB.   
            HE STARTED GROWING  
            AT THE RATE         
            OF 8 TO 10 FEET     
            A DAY.              
            YOU MAY HAVE READ   
            ABOUT HIM.          
SURE! COLONEL GLENN MANNING,    
THE COLOSSAL MAN.               
I REMEMBER.                     
        GLENN HAD REACHED       
        A HEIGHT                
        OF OVER 60 FEET         
        WHEN HE DISAPPEARED.    
WELL, DIDN'T                    
HE GET SHOT                     
AND THROWN OFF                  
OF BOULDER DAM                  
AND GET KILLED?                 
                THAT'S RIGHT.   
            BUT MISS MANNING    
            SEEMS TO HAVE       
            AN IDEA             
            THAT HE SURVIVED    
            BOTH THE ARTILLERY  
            FIRE AND THE FALL.  
            THAT IS WHAT        
            YOU'RE GETTING AT,  
            ISN'T IT?           
        I'LL LEAVE IT           
        UP TO MR. SWANSON.      
        WOULDN'T THAT ACCOUNT   
        FOR THE DISAPPEARANCE   
        OF YOUR TRUCK?          
LOOK, LADY, LEAVE ME            
OUT OF THIS.                    
I DIDN'T SEE                    
NO FOOTPRINTS.                  
 I DIDN'T SEE                   
 NO GIANT.                      
I DIDN'T SEE                    
ANYTHING.                       
I'VE GOT                        
ENOUGH TROUBLE

        ELSE WHO MIGHT HELP ME?

    GOOD-BYE.                   
        HADN'T YOU BETTER GIVE  
        HIM UP, MISS MANNING?   
        THE ARMY DID            
        SOME TIME AGO.          
YOU NEVER                       
FOUND HIS BODY.                 
        THE RIVER BELOW THE DAM 
        IS A MILE DEEP          
        IN SOME PLACES.         
        HIS BODY IS DOWN THERE  
        SOMEWHERE,              
        AND IT WILL SHOW UP     
        IN TIME.                
        YOU THINK GLENN         
        MADE HIS WAY            
        DOWN THAT RIVER SOMEHOW 
        AND REACHED THE GULF OF 
        CALIFORNIA, DON'T YOU?  
        BELIEVE ME,             
        IT'S IMPOSSIBLE.        
        I WAS IN CHARGE         
        OF THE SEARCH FOR HIM,  
        AND I KNOW.             
        THE MEDICAL AUTHORITIES 
        ALL AGREE               
        NO MAN, NO MATTER       
        WHAT HIS SIZE,          
        COULD TAKE THOSE        
        2 BAZOOKA CHARGES       
        AND A DROP              
        OF OVER 700 FEET        
         AND COME               
         THROUGH IT ALIVE.      
        WELL, THOSE ARE         
        THE FACTS.              
        TAKE MY ADVICE          
        AND FACE THEM.

     IN YOUR BROTHER'S CASE.    
I ONLY HOPE I CAN               
DO SOMETHING                    
FOR HIM,                        
MISS MANNING.                   
            THANK YOU, DOCTOR.  
            UH, DOCTOR          
            CARMICHAEL,         
            MAJOR BAIRD, THIS   
            IS SERGEANT MURILLO 
            OF THE MEXICAN      
            STATE POLICE.       
    WHERE WAS IT THE BOY        
    SAW THE COLOSSAL MAN,       
    THE GIANT?                  
         EL OGRO?               
        HE HAS NOT BEEN         
        ABLE TO TELL US.        
            THE SERGEANT        
            CAN SHOW YOU        
            WHERE THE TRUCK     
            DISAPPEARED, THOUGH.
         SÍ, SEÑOR.             
        WON'T YOU GET           
        IN MY AUTOMOBILE?       
    FINE.                       
    Murillo: THIS IS WHERE      
    THE BOY MIGUEL WAS FOUND.   
        THESE TRACKS WERE MADE  
            BY THE TRUCK        
            HE WAS DRIVING.     
        THE TRUCK APPARENTLY    
        SKIDDED INTO THE WATER. 
        IT NEVER DROVE OUT.     
            WHAT DO             
            YOU THINK, MARK?    
    IT SEEMS LIKE PRETTY MEAGER 
    EVIDENCE TO CONCLUDE        
    BECAUSE A TRUCK DISAPPEARED,
    THAT THE COLOSSAL MAN       
    IS STILL ALIVE.             
BUT THE BOY.                    
    OH, I'M SURE THERE'S        
    SOME LOGICAL EXPLANATION.   
                 SEÑORES.       
                 SEÑORES,       
                 COME QUICKLY.  
                THAT IS A VERY  
                BIG FOOTPRINT.  
    Joyce: MAJOR BAIRD, IS      
    THAT ENOUGH LOGIC FOR YOU?  
        THE FOOT THAT MADE      
        THAT PRINT IS ABOUT...  
        10 TIMES THE SIZE       
        OF A NORMAL MAN.        
        THAT WOULD MAKE HIM     
        ABOUT 60 FEET TALL.     
            GLENN WAS           
            60 FEET TALL.       
                HE MUST HAVE    
                GONE THAT WAY,  
            TO THE MOUNTAINS.   
YOU THINK HE COULD              
BE UP IN THOSE MOUNTAINS?       
            YES, IT COULD BE.   
            THERE ARE NO PEOPLE 
            UP THERE.           
WELL, LET'S DRIVE SLOWLY.       
MAYBE WE COULD FIND             
SOME MORE FOOTPRINTS.           
WHAT DO YOU SEE, LUIS?          
            THERE ARE NO MORE   
            FOOTPRINTS,         
             THE GROUND         
             IS TOO HARD HERE.  
            I SEE SOMETHING     
            OVER THERE.         
        LET'S TAKE A LOOK.      
    THIS MUST BE PART OF        
    SWANSON'S MISSING TRUCK.    
            NO, THIS IS ANOTHER 
            TRUCK, SEÑORITA.    
            SWANSON'S TRUCK     
            IS DARK GREEN.      
            BED STAKE.          
            TON AND A HALF.     
        [RUMBLING]              
        NOTHING BUT             
        A ROCK SLIDE.           
            IT IS GETTING LATE. 
            WE BETTER GO HOME.  
            IT IS NOT GOOD TO   
            BE HERE AFTER DARK. 
        THANK YOU.              
OH, NO, THANKS.                 
I HAVE PLENTY.                  
    SORRY TO BE SO LONG.        
    BUT I JUST TALKED           
TO THE MEXICAN MILITARY         
AUTHORITIES ON THE PHONE.       
THEY HAVE TROOPS                
AND ARTILLERY STANDING BY.      
ALL WE HAVE TO DO               
IS PINPOINT THE COLOSSAL MAN    
AND THEY'LL MOVE                
IN ON HIM.                      
        HE MIGHT COME WILLINGLY 
        IF WE REASONED WITH HIM.
HOW DO YOU REASON               
WITH A 60-FOOT GIANT?           
    IT'S POSSIBLE               
    HE'D LISTEN TO SOMEBODY     
    HE KNOWS WELL,              
    LIKE MISS MANNING.          
    WHY NOT TRY IT?             
NO, I--I DON'T WANT             
ANYBODY GETTING HURT.           
            PLEASE LET ME TRY   
            AT LEAST.           
NO, I'M SORRY.                  
            BE REASONABLE.      
            IF YOU USE          
            FORCE ON HIM,       
            SOMEBODY WILL       
            GET HURT.           
            VERY WELL THEN.     
            I'LL GO ALONE.      
WAIT.                           
 WAIT, MISS MANNING.            
            MISS MANNING...     
            I DIDN'T ASK        
            FOR THIS JOB,       
            I WAS ASSIGNED      
            TO IT.              
            AND IF I'M GONNA    
            GET IT DONE,        
            I'LL HAVE TO HANDLE 
            IT IN MY OWN WAY.   
WELL, IT SEEMS                  
TO ME YOUR WAY                  
IS GOING TO HURT HIM            
MORE THAN HELP HIM.             
        I HAVE TO THINK OF      
        THE SAFETY OF OTHERS,   
        AS WELL AS HIM.         
        THAT GOES FOR YOU, TOO. 
[SIGHS]                         
I'M TO FORGET                   
HE'S MY BROTHER                 
AND DO NOTHING,                 
I SUPPOSE.                      
        IT'S NATURAL FOR YOU TO 
        BE CONCERNED ABOUT HIM, 
        BUT CAN'T YOU           
        LET IT GO AT THAT?      
        WELL, YOU DON'T         
        EVEN KNOW               
        IF HE'LL                
        RECOGNIZE YOU OR NOT.   
LET ME FIND OUT.                
        WE'LL SEE               
        ABOUT IT TOMORROW       
        WHEN THE SOLDIERS       
        ARRIVE.                 
OH, TODAY, PLEASE,              
BEFORE THEY GET HERE.           
PLEASE.                         
        WHAT MAKES YOU SO SURE  
        YOU'RE GOING            
        TO FIND HIM?            
        WHY, HE HAS A WHOLE     
        MOUNTAIN RANGE          
        TO HIDE IN.             
BUT WE HAVE                     
SOMETHING TO GO ON,             
THOSE FOOTPRINTS.               
        ALL RIGHT.              
        GET IN MY CAR.          
            HE'S BEEN RAIDING   
            THESE TRUCKS        
            FOR FOOD TO LIVE ON.
            THIS WAS A RIFLE.   
MAJOR, LOOK AT THIS.            
IT'S HIS THUMBPRINT.            
            THIS WAS            
            SWANSON'S TRUCK.    
        [RUMBLING]              
        WHAT'S THAT?            
I DON'T KNOW.                   
            [GROWLING]          
             [GRUNTING]         
GET BACK, JOYCE.                
            [GRUNTING]          
            [GROWLING]          
        [CRASH]                 
            [GROWLS]            
I HOPE THEY                     
ARE BAKING IT                   
THE WAY YOU WANT IT, SEÑOR.     
            I THINK             
            IT'S ALL RIGHT.     
            WHEN WILL           
            THE REST BE DONE?   
THEY SAY IT WOULD               
BE READY SOON.                  
 THEY ARE ALREADY               
 LOADING THE TRUCK.             
            GOOD.               
            TRY IT.             
            CAN YOU TASTE       
            ANYTHING?           
TASTES LIKE BREAD.              
WHAT'S IN IT?                   
            CHLORAL HYDRATE.    
            ENOUGH TO PUT HIM TO
            SLEEP FOR 8 HOURS.  
            I'LL BE             
            AT THE BAKERY.      
WE HAVE TO CAPTURE HIM.         
AND THIS SEEMS                  
TO BE THE BEST WAY.             
DR. CARMICHAEL SAYS             
IT CAN'T HARM HIM               
IN THE LEAST.                   
        ISN'T THERE ANY OTHER   
        WAY TO HANDLE IT?       
WELL, IT'S THAT OR LET          
THE MEXICAN AUTHORITIES         
DEAL WITH HIM.                  
WE HAVE NO OTHER                
ALTERNATIVES.                   
        NOBODY'S TAKEN THE TIME 
        TO THINK OF ANY,        
        AS FAR AS I CAN SEE.    
THERE ISN'T TIME                
TO TAKE.                        
IF WE DON'T GET HIM             
BEFORE HE DECIDES TO MOVE       
TO ANOTHER MOUNTAIN,            
WE MAY LOSE CONTACT             
WITH HIM FOR WEEKS.             
        I SUPPOSE YOU'RE RIGHT. 
        HIS FACE.               
        I CAN'T FORGET          
        HOW HORRIBLE IT WAS.    
WHERE YOU FROM, JOYCE?          
        MY HOME IS              
        IN SAN FRANCISCO.       
DON'T YOU THINK YOU'D           
BE BETTER OFF BACK THERE?       
        DO YOU KNOW             
        WHAT IT WOULD BE LIKE   
        TO BE JUST SITTING      
        AROUND WAITING FOR NEWS?
YOU MIND IF I                   
SUGGEST A REMEDY?               
IT'S AN OLD ONE,                
BUT IT USUALLY WORKS.           
FIND SOMETHING ELSE             
TO OCCUPY YOUR MIND.            
DO YOU HAVE A JOB?              
        I WRITE COPY FOR        
        AN ADVERTISING AGENCY.  
WELL, THAT SHOULD HELP          
YOU FORGET YOUR TROUBLES.       
        I CAN IMAGINE           
        MYSELF GOING BACK       
        TO WRITING ALL THOSE    
        TIRED OLD ADJECTIVES.   
        TREMENDOUS,             
        GIGANTIC, COLOSSAL.     
        YOU KNOW WHAT           
        THEY'D MEAN TO ME NOW,  
        DON'T YOU?              
        GLENN.                  
        A COLOSSAL FREAK, MAJOR.
        AND HE'S MY BROTHER.    
            [DOOR OPENS]        
            Carmichael: WE'RE   
            ALL SET, MAJOR.     
        THIS IS NEAR THE AREA   
        WHERE HE ATTACKED       
        SWANSON'S TRUCK.        
        YOU THINK HE'LL EAT     
        THIS STUFF?             
ALL DEPENDS                     
ON HIS APPETITE.                
            THERE HASN'T        
            BEEN A TRUCK        
            THROUGH THIS ROUTE  
            FOR 2 DAYS NOW.     
            HE SHOULD BE HUNGRY.
            LET ME DRIVE, I KNOW
            THIS ROAD BEST.     
        ALL RIGHT.              
        THERE'S STILL           
        NO SIGN OF HIM.         
        IF WE DON'T             
        MAKE CONTACT,           
        WE'LL MAKE              
        THE TRIP AGAIN.         
        BECAUSE WE ARE          
        LOOKING FOR A GIANT,    
        IT DOESN'T FOLLOW       
        THAT WE DON'T           
        VALUE OUR LIVES.        
BESIDES, WE WANT HIM            
TO CATCH US.                    
AT THIS SPEED                   
HE'LL NEVER MAKE IT.            
            I DON'T             
            DRIVE THIS WAY      
            TO MAKE YOU         
            NERVOUS, SEÑORES.   
            BUT THE FASTER      
            WE GO,              
             THE MORE DUST      
             WE MAKE,           
            AND THE FURTHER     
            AWAY IT WILL SHOW.  
            BESIDES, GIANTS RUN 
            VERY FAST.          
            THEY HAVE LONG LEGS.
HE'S RIGHT BEHIND US.           
YOU BETTER STEP ON IT.          
HE'S GETTING CLOSE.             
            WHEN WE GET         
            TO THE CLEARING,    
            I WILL SLOW DOWN.   
            WE BETTER JUMP THEN.
IF WE MAKE IT.                  
            WE WILL.            
            GET READY.

    THE CASE OF ARMY COLONEL    
        GLENN MANNING,          
        THE COLOSSAL MAN        
        WHO WENT BERSERK        
    IN LAS VEGAS NOT LONG AGO,  
        IS IN THE NEWS          
        AGAIN TODAY.            
    MILITARY AUTHORITIES        
    LAST NIGHT ADMITTED         
    THAT THE EARLY ANNOUNCEMENT 
        HE HAD BEEN             
    ACCIDENTALLY DESTROYED      
        WAS AN ERROR.           
    HE WAS CAPTURED ALIVE TODAY 
            IN MEXICO,          
    AND PLANS ARE UNDERWAY      
        TO FLY HIM              
    BACK ACROSS THE BORDER      
IN A TROOP CARRIER TRANSPORT.   
        YOU MAY QUOTE ME        
        AS SAYING               
        THAT THE NATION         
        AND ITS REPRESENTATIVES 
        IN CONGRESS             
        HAVE NOTHING

        FOR OUR SISTER REPUBLIC 
        SOUTH OF THE BORDER     
         FOR THEIR UNSTINTING   
         COOPERATION.           
        AND WE'RE PROUD         
        OF MAJOR BAIRD          
         AND THE WAY            
         HE HANDLED THE PROBLEM 
        OF THE COLOSSAL MAN.    
        IT WAS A GOOD JOB       
        ALL AROUND.             
WELL, NOW THAT                  
HE'S BEING BROUGHT BACK         
TO THE UNITED STATES,           
WHAT DOES CONGRESS              
PLAN TO DO ABOUT HIM?           
        UH, DO ABOUT WHOM?      
WHY, THE GIANT MAN.             
        OH, AS--AS FAR I KNOW,  
        THAT MATTER             
        DOESN'T COME UNDER      
        CONGRESSIONAL           
        JURISDICTION.           
        UH, I WAS GIVEN         
        TO UNDERSTAND           
        THE DEPARTMENT          
        OF MEDICAL RESEARCH     
        TAKES OVER              
        FROM THIS POINT ON.     
        THERE'S NOTHING         
        IN OUR DIRECTIVES       
        ABOUT THE DISPOSITION   
        OF A 60-FOOT GIANT.     
    NATURALLY WE'LL DO WHAT     
    WE CAN IN A SCIENTIFIC WAY, 
    BUT IT'S IMPOSSIBLE         
    FOR THIS DEPARTMENT         
    TO ASSUME THE RESPONSIBILITY
    OF HIS FEEDING AND CUSTODY. 
    WHY DON'T YOU TAKE          
    THIS QUESTION UP            
    WITH THE HEALTH             
    AND WELFARE DEPARTMENT?     
YES, THE MANNING CASE           
WAS REFERRED TO US              
HERE AT HEALTH AND WELFARE,     
BUT WE FOUND IT LAY             
OUTSIDE THE SCOPE               
OF OUR ORIGINAL                 
APPROPRIATION.                  
I HAVE AN IDEA IT WAS           
TURNED OVER TO CONGRESS         
FOR ACTION                      
DURING THE PRESENT SESSION.     
        I CAN'T IMAGINE         
        WHO TOLD YOU TO CALL ME.
        THE PROBLEM ISN'T ONE   
        FOR THE LEGISLATIVE     
        BRANCH TO SETTLE.       
        UH, WHY DON'T YOU       
        CALL THE PENTAGON?      
    TELL THE PILOT TO CIRCLE    
    THE FIELD ONCE MORE.        
            U.S. 1-1-0-3-4,     
            YOU ARE TO CIRCLE   
            THE FIELD AGAIN.    
        Pilot, on radio: ROGER. 
    HE HAS ENOUGH FUEL LEFT     
    FOR 5 MORE MINUTES, MAYOR.  
    I CAN'T UNDERSTAND          
    YOUR NOT GIVING             
    YOUR PERMISSION             
    FOR HIM TO LAND             
    UNDER THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES.  
        I THINK I'VE MADE OUR   
        POSITION PRETTY CLEAR.  
        WE HAVE NO FACILITIES   
        FOR A GIANT HERE.       
    WHEN THAT PLANE             
    RUNS OUT OF GAS,            
    IT'S COMING DOWN            
    WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT. 
        IT CAN'T SAY ANY LONGER 
        THAN IS NECESSARY       
        TO REFUEL               
        AND TAKE OFF AGAIN.     
    TAKE OFF FOR WHERE?         
    WE NEED TIME TO DECIDE      
    WHAT TO DO WITH HIM.        
    CAN'T YOU                   
    FIND US A WAREHOUSE         
    TO KEEP HIM                 
    IN TEMPORARILY?             
        OUR WAREHOUSES          
        ARE ALL LOCATED         
        IN THE HEART            
        OF THE CITY.            
        THIS CREATURE'S         
        PRESENCE THERE          
        WOULD CONSTITUTE TOO    
        GREAT A POLICE PROBLEM. 
        NOW, THAT APPLIES       
        TO EVERY OTHER          
        LARGE DOWNTOWN BUILDING,
        INCLUDING THE COLISEUM. 
        HAVE YOU CONSIDERED     
        THE HOLLYWOOD BOWL?     
    WE CAN'T LEAVE HIM          
    EXPOSED TO THE WEATHER,     
    EVEN IF HE IS A GIANT.      
        WELL, I CAN'T MAKE      
        ANY FURTHER SUGGESTIONS.
    THAT HANGER DOESN'T         
    SEEM TO BE IN USE.          
        WELL, THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.
        THIS AIRPORT IS ONE     
        OF THE MAJOR            
        TRAFFIC CENTERS         
        OF THE WESTERN WORLD.   
        YOU REALIZE             
        WHAT IT WOULD MEAN      
        IF AN UNCONTROLLABLE    
        MONSTER                 
        SHOULD GET LOOSE HERE?  
    I GIVE YOU MY WORD.         
    WE WON'T KEEP HIM HERE      
    A MINUTE LONGER             
    THAN IS ABSOLUTELY          
    NECESSARY.                  
        ALL RIGHT.              
        YOU MAY TELL THE SHIP TO
        COME IN FOR A LANDING.  
            TROOP CARRIER       
            U.S. 1-1-0-3-4,     
            YOU MAY LAND        
            ON RUNWAY 170.      
        [GROWLING]              
WHY ARE YOU KEEPING             
GLENN HERE AT THE AIRPORT?      
        WELL, I'M               
        HOLDING HIM HERE        
        TILL WASHINGTON DECIDES 
        WHAT TO DO WITH HIM.    
WHAT TO DO WITH HIM?            
HE OUGHT TO BE IN               
A HOSPITAL GETTING TREATMENT.   
        THEY DON'T              
        MAKE HOSPITALS          
        THAT BIG, JOYCE.        
        BESIDES, AS YET         
        THE DOCTORS             
        HAVEN'T TURNED          
        UP ANYTHING             
        THAT CAN HELP HIM.      
WELL, WHY DON'T THEY            
TREAT HIM WITH SULFHYDRYL?      
ISN'T THAT WHAT THEY            
SAID WOULD CURE HIM?            
        WELL, THEY FOUND IT     
        STOPPED HIS GROWTH,     
        BUT...                  
        I'M AFRAID IT           
        WON'T REVERSE IT.       
I SEE.                          
WELL, THEY CAN'T                
KEEP HIM HERE                   
AS IF HE WERE SOME              
KIND OF CATTLE.                 
            IT'S JUST           
            FOR THE TIME BEING. 
        I'M AFRAID THE WORLD    
        DOESN'T THINK           
        OF A 60-FOOT MAN        
        THE WAY HIS SISTER DOES.
    [GLENN GROWLING]            
        [GRUNTING]              
I SUPPOSE IT'S NECESSARY        
TO KEEP HIM TIED                
DOWN LIKE THIS.                 
        IF I COULD TRUST HIM,   
        I COULD LET HIM         
        HAVE MORE FREEDOM.      
        AS IT IS, I HAVE        
        TO PLAY IT SAFE.

        FROM 8 TO 10 FEET A DAY.
        AT THE MOMENT,          
        HE'S 18 FEET TALL.      
    TOMORROW HE'LL BE 26 FEET,  
        THE NEXT DAY 35,        
        MAYBE 40,               
        AND THE NEXT DAY...     
I JUST DON'T WANT               
TO GROW ANYMORE.                
 I DON'T WANT

            A 60-FOOT GIANT     
            IN THE STREETS      
            OF LAS VEGAS.       
             LOOK AT THE SIZE

    DO YOU RECOGNIZE US?        
    WE DO NOT WISH TO HARM YOU. 
        WE WANT TO HELP YOU.    
        WE WANT TO HELP YOU     
        TO GET WELL.            
        DO YOU UNDERSTAND?      
        WE CAN HELP YOU.        
        OK, HARRIGAN, LET'S GO. 
    DRIVE IT IN HARD.           
    WE HAVE TO                  
    PENETRATE THE BONE          
    ON THE FIRST INJECTION.     
    I DOUBT IF WE'LL

    FROM THE PLANES             
    WITH TEAR GAS.              
        ANESTHETIC WOULD BE     
        BETTER THAN TEAR GAS.

GONNA DO TO HIM?                
        I DON'T KNOW.           
        BUT I CAN'T             
        LET HIM LOOSE           
        AMONG A MILLION PEOPLE. 
ARE YOU GONNA                   
HAVE TO KILL HIM?

IS HE?                          
            WELL, HE'S TOO WEAK 
            TO BREAK LOOSE,     
            AT THE MOMENT.      
                    [SNORING]   
            HE LOST             
            CONSIDERABLE BLOOD  
            IN HIS ATTEMPT      
            TO ESCAPE.          
            BESIDES THAT,       
            WE'VE TAKEN         
            EXTRA PRECAUTIONS   
            WITH HIM.           
            LET ME SHOW YOU.    
            WE KEEP A WATCH ON  
            HIM NIGHT AND DAY.  
            THOSE MANACLES WERE 
            SPECIALLY WROUGHT   
            TO STAND 10 TIMES   
            HIS ESTIMATED       
            STRENGTH.           
            WE HAVE THEM        
            ANCHORED IN CEMENT  
            WEIGHING 2 TONS     
            AND SOME 12 FEET    
            IN THE EARTH.       
            GUARDS HAVE BEEN    
            DOUBLED, AND WE KEEP
            A RESERVE FORCE     
            ON STANDBY DUTY.    
            AND THERE'S NOT MUCH
            CHANCE HE'LL GIVE US
            ANY MORE TROUBLE    
            FOR THE TIME BEING. 
WELL, YOU CERTAINLY             
HAVE TAKEN MEASURES,            
BUT YOU CAN'T EXPECT            
TO KEEP HIM HERE FOR LIFE.      
HAVE YOU ANY IDEA               
WHAT'LL HAPPEN                  
TO HIM EVENTUALLY?              
        WELL, THAT DEPENDS.     
        YOU SEE ANY HOPE        
        THAT HE'LL EVER IMPROVE?
            WELL, I'D RATHER    
            HAVE YOU ASK

HOW DO YOU DO?                  
        AND GENERAL NELSON.     
    HOW DO YOU DO,              
    GENERAL?                    
        WHAT CAN                
        YOU TELL THEM           
        ABOUT YOUR PATIENT,     
        DOCTOR?                 
    WELL, THE BIG               
    QUESTION NOW IS             
    HIS MIND.                   
    HE MAY BE SUFFERING         
    FROM AMNESIA,               
    SHELL-SHOCK,                
    LOSS OF MEMORY,             
    WHATEVER YOU WANT           
    TO CALL IT.                 
    IN THAT CASE,               
    WE HAVE TECHNIQUES NOW      
    THAT WILL BRING             
    HIM OUT OF IT.              
    ON THE OTHER HAND,          
    IF HIS BRAIN TISSUE         
    HAS SUFFERED INJURY,        
    HE'LL BE                    
    A PSYCHOPATHIC CASE         
    AND A MENACE                
    UNTIL HE DIES.              
            IS THERE ANY WAY    
            OF TELLING?         
    AN EXAMINATION              
    WOULD DO THAT.              
            HOW SOON CAN YOU    
            PROCEED WITH IT?    
        [TELEPHONE RINGS]       
    ALMOST IMMEDIATELY.         
            PLEASE, DO SO.      
            WE'LL DECIDE        
            WHAT'S TO BE DONE   
            WITH MANNING        
            AS SOON AS WE HAVE  
            THE DOCTOR'S        
            FINDINGS.           
        WE'LL KEEP YOU POSTED,  
        GENERAL.                
            AND I'LL CHECK      
            WITH YOU            
            BEFORE I RETURN TO  
            WASHINGTON, MAJOR.  
        YES, SIR.               
        BUT I TELL YOU,         
        A MAN'S LIFE DEPENDS    
        ON THIS PLASMA.         
        I KNOW 10 GALLONS       
        IS A LOT,               
        BUT DR. CARMICHAEL      
        EXPLAINED THE CASE      
        TO YOU THIS MORNING.    
        I CAN'T SIT HERE        
        AND ARGUE ABOUT IT.     
        IT'S NEEDED RIGHT AWAY. 
        JUST A MOMENT, PLEASE.  
        DR. CARMICHAEL.         
        WILL YOU TALK TO THE RED
        CROSS PEOPLE, PLEASE?   
        THEY REFUSE TO SEND ANY 
        MORE PLASMA FOR GLENN.  
         THEY SAY WE'VE USED    
         TOO MUCH ALREADY.      
    MARK.                       
THIS IS MAJOR BAIRD.            
MY MEN AND I WILL SEE           
THAT YOU GET BACK               
ALL THE BLOOD WE USE            
FOR THIS CASE.                  
NOW, YOU SEND OVER              
WHAT WE NEED IMMEDIATELY.       
THANK YOU.                      
GOOD-BYE.                       
THEY'LL HAVE IT HERE            
IN HALF AN HOUR.                
        OH, MAJOR. WAIT.        
        I WANT TO THANK YOU.    
FORGET IT.                      
        I'M SORRY FOR WHAT      
        I SAID YESTERDAY.       
        I KNOW YOU'VE TRIED     
        TO SAVE GLENN           
        AS MUCH AS YOU COULD.   
YOU LOOK TIRED,                 
JOYCE.                          
ISN'T IT TIME                   
YOU WENT HOME?                  
        I SUPPOSE IT IS.        
THERE'S AN ARMY CAR             
WAITING OUTSIDE,                
IF YOU'D LIKE                   
TO GO HOME TONIGHT.             
        WITH A SOLIDER          
        TO SEE ME TO THE DOOR?  
THIS TIME                       
I'LL DO IT MYSELF.              
            [SNORING]           
    [CHAINS CLANKING]           
        THIS IS AN              
        ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPH.  
        IT RECORDS IMPULSES     
        SET OFF BY DIFFERENT    
        PARTS OF THE BRAIN.     
        IT RECORDS THEM         
        ON THIS PAPER,          
        MAKING THESE WAVY LINES.
        NOW, WE'RE GOING        
        TO TRY TO STIMULATE     
        YOUR BROTHER'S MIND     
        WITH VARIOUS IDEAS.     
        IF ONE HAPPENS          
        TO AROUSE A RESPONSE,   
        IT WILL CAUSE A TINY    
        ELECTRIC CURRENT        
        TO OCCUR IN HIS BRAIN.  
        AND THAT, IN TURN, WILL 
        BE GREATLY AMPLIFIED    
        BY THIS MACHINE.        
        SO THAT IT WILL         
        REGISTER ON THIS PAPER. 
WELL, WHAT WOULD                
THAT TELL US?                   
        IF HE RESPONDS          
        TO ANYTHING, IT MEANS...
            CURABLE AMNESIA.    
            IF NOT...           
I UNDERSTAND.                   
        WILL YOU GET THIS       
        NOW, PLEASE?            
    [GLENN SNORING]             
            THIS IS FAR ENOUGH. 
            DR. RICHARDSON?     
HOW'S THE                       
EXAMINATION COMING?             
            COMING ALONG FINE.  
                I'LL BE DOWN    
                IN A MINUTE.    
        I'LL GET                
        THE INSTRUMENT READY.   
        COULD YOU               
        HOOK THIS UP, PLEASE.   
        BILL, BRING A PROJECTOR.
        SET IT UP OVER THERE.   
IS THE SCREEN GOING TO BE       
ALL RIGHT UP THERE, DOCTOR?     
            YES, THAT'S FINE.   
        ANY OPINION YET,        
        DR. RICHARDSON?         
I'VE NEVER SEEN SUCH            
DREADFUL FACIAL INJURIES.       
HOW WERE THEY SUSTAINED?        
            WHEN HE FELL        
            FROM BOULDER DAM,   
            HE MUST HAVE HIT HIS
            HEAD ON THE ROCKS.  
        OF COURSE, THE WOUNDS   
        WENT UNTENDED,          
        SO SCAR TISSUE FORMED   
        AS YOU SEE IT.          
THE SHOCK OF SUCH               
A FALL WOULD INDICATE           
THE POSSIBILITY OF AMNESIA,     
WOULDN'T YOU SAY?               
            MM-HMM.             
WELL, THAT'S STANDARD.          
I GET A NORMAL                  
NERVOUS REACTION.               
THAT'S CERTAINLY NOT            
TYPICAL OF AMNESIA.             
LOOKS LIKE BRAIN TRAUMA,        
I'M AFRAID.                     
ARE YOU READY                   
FOR THE ASSOCIATION TEST?       
            YOU READY, PHIL?    
            LET'S HAVE          
            THE FIRST SLIDE.

            IN FRONT OF YOU.

            ANYTHING TO YOU?

            LOOK AT THIS FACE.  
            DO YOU RECOGNIZE IT?
        UNH...                  
            DOES THIS MAN MEAN  
            ANYTHING TO YOU?    
        HMM...                  
            LOOK AT IT, MANNING!
            DO YOU UNDERSTAND?  
            IT'S YOUR FACE!     
            WHAT DO YOU         
            THINK, DOCTOR?      
I DON'T SEE

                [SIGHS]         
GET YOUR ORDERS?                
        THEY'RE SHIPPING HIM    
        OUT TOMORROW MORNING.   
        THE NAVY HAS A SHIP     
        READY TO TAKE HIM       
            TO THE ISLAND.      
        IT'S A SMALL ONE ABOUT  
        60 MILES OFF THE COAST. 
THAT DOESN'T LEAVE              
US MUCH TIME.                   
            IT'LL TAKE ALL NIGHT
            TO GET HIM READY.   
TOLD JOYCE YET?                 
                NO.             
YOU'D BETTER.                   
SHE'S AT HER HOTEL.             
        I'LL SEE YOU BACK HERE  
        IN ABOUT A HALF AN HOUR.

PARACHUTED DOWN TO HIM.

WITH EVERYTHING HE NEEDS.       
            JUST THE SAME,      
            IT'S HORRIBLE.      
THERE'S NO PLACE                
IN THE CIVILIZED WORLD          
FOR A CREATURE THAT BIG.        
YOU SEE WHAT'S                  
HAPPENED TO HIM.                
HE'LL BE HAPPIER                
BY HIMSELF.                     
        OH, I SUPPOSE I SHOULD  
        AGREE WITH YOU, BUT...  
        I CAN'T HELP FEELING    
        TERRIBLY SORRY FOR HIM. 
LOOK AT IT THIS WAY,            
GLENN HAS BECOME                
A TOTAL STRANGER TO YOU.        
HE'S NOT YOUR                   
BROTHER ANYMORE,                
BUT A...MONSTER.                
WITH THE INSTINCTS              
OF A WILD BEAST.                
AND THERE'S NOTHING             
YOU AND I, OR ANYONE ELSE       
CAN EVER DO THAT                
WILL CHANGE HIM BACK            
TO WHAT HE ONCE WAS.            
        [CHAIN SNAPPING]        
        [GROANING]              
        WILL HE BE ALONE        
        ON THIS ISLAND?         
THE NAVY WILL LAND AN           
INSPECTION PARTY EVERY MONTH.   
            I'D LIKE TO GO      
            WITH THEM, IF I CAN.

        BEFORE ANYTHING COULD

            OH, OFFICER.        
        THERE WAS A SCHOOL BUS  
            FROM WESTMONT       
            JUNIOR HIGH         
        UP AT THE PLANETARIUM   
        TONIGHT.                
            DID YOU SEE IT      
            COME DOWN?          
ALL CARS WERE CHECKED OUT       
OF THE PARK SOME TIME AGO.      
            ARE YOU SURE?       
            MY DAUGHTER         
            LAURIE WAS ON IT.   
            I'VE BEEN WAITING   
            FOR HER             
            DOWN AT THE CORNER. 
            YOU SEE, WE LIVE    
            IN GLENDALE.        
            AND I THOUGHT IF    
            I PICKED HER UP HERE
            AND DROVE HER HOME, 
            SHE COULD           
            GET HER SLEEP.      
            SHE HAS TO GET UP   
        SO EARLY IN THE MORNING 
        ON SCHOOL DAYS.         
        WELL, I BROUGHT HER COAT
        IN CASE SHE'S COLD.     
WAIT A MINUTE,                  
AND I'LL CHECK.

        THE BUS IS STILL        
        UP THERE,               
        BUT IT SEEMS TO BE SAFE.
CAN'T I GO THROUGH?             
LET ME GO TO                    
LAURIE, PLEASE.                 
 SHE OUGHT TO                   
 HAVE HER COAT.                 
I WANTED HER                    
TO TAKE IT                      
WHEN SHE LEFT                   
THE HOUSE THIS MORNING.         
ONLY I FORGOT                   
TO REMIND HER.                  
        SHE'LL BE ALL RIGHT     
        WITHOUT IT.             
        JUST YOU TAKE IT EASY   
        AND WAIT RIGHT HERE.

This is a story of the future.
It is a story that might have taken place the day after tomorrow.
Like all stories of the future, however,
its beginnings lie far back in the past,
as far back as the first man on Earth
to gaze at the stars and wonder,
someday, somehow, he might travel to them.
Travel through space.
In the years following the Second World War,
two basic patterns began to influence
the growing science of space travel.
Rockets, or guided missiles, grew larger and larger.
Atomic power plants grew smaller and smaller,
compact enough to be contained in a submarine.
And finally, in a rocket ship.
Immediately, by special order of the president,
a new agency was formed.
Civil interplanetary Flight Commission.
So, with almost unlimited funds voted by Congress,
this commission began its task:
research in new fissionable materials...
more research in non-fissionable metallic alloys
to make rocket tubes that would not be melted like wax
by their own atomic blasts.
Sometimes mishaps occurred.
And men paid for them with their lives.
But the work went on.
Experiments in celestial navigation...
astrophysics, aerodynamics,
until, finally, only one obstacle remained.
That, as our story begins, turned out to be
the oldest obstacle in the history of mankind...
the human factor.
Down! Down!
Start to reduce speed!
Not too fast!
- Now see here, Dr. Harrison.
- You have no right...
Steady. Slower, slower.
Really, Dr. Harrison, this is intolerable.
Dan! Dan, are you all right?
Dan, snap out of it!
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.
Dan, how do you feel? Okay?
Yeah, I guess so.
Must have blacked out.
Sit tight and take it easy.
Now get him out of there and over to the hospital.
You see, Doctor, he wasn't in any real danger.
Under other forms of government, men are deliberately killed or crippled every day in experiments like this.
Well, I won't stand by and see manslaughter become policy here.
I resent that implication.
- These men are volunteers!
- And that's too bad.
The commissioner was most anxious to have this test carried out to the extreme so that he could discuss the results with Professor Nordstrom.
Well, you can tell the commissioner and Professor Nordstrom-
Never mind, I'll tell them myself.
The commissioner's office.
Good morning, General.
Yes, Professor Nordstrom's with the commissioner now.
No, I'm sorry.
Dr. Harrison, what's the matter?
I want to see the commissioner.
I'm sorry, he's with
Professor Nordstrom.
Ms. Baker, make copies of these for Professor Nordstrom, please.
- I want to see you.
- In just a few minutes, Harrison.
I can't talk to you at the moment.
You don't have to. Just listen.
I resign as of now.
Harrison, what in the world's wrong with you?
I told you once before that I'm not going to stand by anymore and watch human beings being turned into guinea pigs.
My dear Harrison, the uncovering of knowledge must always involve risk for pioneers.
Fortunately, there are always men and Women ready to take those risks.
Now, you know that as well as I do.
That's not the point, and you know it.
We shouldn't even be considering the use of test pilots in this first experimental ship.
It's not only inhuman, it's unscientific and unintelligent.
That's quite enough.
We'll resume this discussion later on.
Why, you are in a state.
There's my pass, staff card, and the badge.
You can send my papers down to the hotel.
Just a moment, Doctor.
You can't leave the building without your exit pass, you know.
- Yes?
- Dr. Harrison?
This is Gilligan of Transglobal News.
I'm down in the lobby.
As far as I'm concerned, you can stay there.
Now, hold on, Doc.
All I want to know is what's going on
between you and Professor Nordstrom.
Nothing!
Yes?
This is The Washington Globe,
Dr. Harrison.
We're trying to contact
Professor Nordstrom.
Look, if this is a gag, it's not very funny.
I've never even met
Professor Nordstrom and there's no reason to suppose that I ever will.
- Dr. Harrison?
- Yes.
Are you, by any chance, going to talk to me about Professor Nordstrom?
Why, yes, in a way.
Well, let me tell you this.
A, he isn't here,
B, I don't know where he is,
C, I've never met him, and D, I don't want to.
Three misstatements out of four, Doctor.
That's a bad average for a man of science.
You see, I am Professor Nordstrom,
- and I'm very glad to meet you at last.
- You are?
- Yeah.
- Why?
Because I've followed your career with interest, and we see eye to eye on a subject with which I'm particularly concerned.
We do? I don't get it.
Well, perhaps a little more seclusion might be a good idea.
Do you mind if I make myself comfortable?
No. Go ahead.
Well, the fact is, Doctor,
I overheard your little interview with the CIFC director this morning.
As I had just spent an hour telling him exactly what you told him so much more cogently in a couple of minutes,
I was, well, interested, to say the least.
You mean to tell me you think they're wrong in trying to use human beings?
I know they're wrong.
Before we can prepare men for the conditions they're going to meet in extraterrestrial space,
We've got to know what those conditions are.
Not guess, but know.
That's what I've been telling them all along.
But the problem of getting there and back to collect accurate data without the use of human pilots and observers is going to be a back-breaker.
On the contrary,
I can almost say now that I have it solved.
With your collaboration,
I think I can convert that "almost" into an unqualified fact.
Skyliner Flight Number 1 for Los Angeles
will board at South Concourse,
Gate Number 5 in 15 minutes.
So we can start work the moment we arrive, without all of those coils of red tape hampering us all the time.
Yes. I know what you mean.
I suppose that sprang from the secret nature of the project in the first place.
Top secret?
Someday, before I'm too old,
I look forward to working on a job
Where I don't have to burn the contents of my wastebasket every night.
You never can tell who might be hiding in a wastebasket.
Don't tell me you're a security regulations quoter, too, my boy.
Okay.
You were saying you'd be able to show me what you're working on as soon as we arrive.
I'll have to.
Every minute counts now because we have to perfect my innovation before the commission is ready to send out its first ship.
Now, if we'd...
Well, well, if it isn't
Professor Nordstrom.
I don't know whether you remember me or not.
Uh, Gilligan, Science Editor of Transglobal News Service.
You'll have to forgive me, Mr. Gilligan, but I've met so many journalists here in Washington.
All you scientists are supposed to be absent-minded.
Me, I'm trained never to forget a face.
I'm afraid we're talking shop, Gilligan.
That's what I figured.
You're Harrison, aren't you?
Of the Civil interplanetary
Flight Commission.
No comment.
Well, you were until you quit this morning.
And what was that all about, Doctor?
You two being together here at the airport...
This anything to do with the trouble you've had with the commission, Professor?
I'm afraid I have no comment for that, either.
Now why don't you leave us both alone?
Oh, take it easy, Doc.
Never can tell what kind of a story will gel when you big brains huddle together.
Like the one your syndicate released prematurely about the hydrogen bomb drops in the Pacific or the atomic aircraft carrier engine?
Look, you're in the business of smashing atoms.
I'm in the business of selling newspapers.
If Uncle Sam doesn't know how to keep his own secrets, that's his tough luck.
It doesn't matter how much aid or comfort you give our potential enemies or how many of our side eventually get killed.
Hold it, Ralph.
Now, listen, Mr. Gilligan...
You listen to me, Professor.
You fellas can't go on dummying up like this indefinitely.
Sooner or later you've got to talk for the record.
Look at it this way.
The prospect of space travel in the immediate future is the biggest news story in the country today.
Years and years of research, millions and millions of taxpayers' dollars have been spent building that first spaceship.
Now, when it's just about ready to take off, what happens?
One of the greatest scientific minds in the world...
That's you...
Comes out and disagrees about how the ship's to be worked.
I was about to say, Mr. Gilligan,
I'd be willing to make a statement...
I don't want a statement,
I want facts.
It's no secret in Washington that the row was over your not wanting to use men on the first space trip.
What the people of the United States want to know is what you propose using instead.
If I were prepared with the facts you're talking about now, I'd tell you.
Only right now, I'm not.
However, I will tell you this.
Just 30 days from now, at my home in California,
Dr. Harrison and I will tell all, or at least as much as circumstances at that time will allow.
I'll be there, Professor!
So will the science editors of, say, 11 other press services.
Well, I thought this was an exclusive.
It ought to be.
Do the people of the United States read only Transglobal news releases, Mr. Gilligan?
Your attention, please.
Skyliner Flight Number 1 for Los Angeles
now boarding at South Concourse,
Gate Number 5.
That's our call, Professor.
I'll, uh, see you in California, Mr. Gilligan.
Okay. Okay.
Skyliner Flight
Number 1 for Los Angeles
now boarding at South Concourse,
Gate Number 5.
Well, here we are.
Yes, but where are we?
You'll see in a minute.
You made good time, Karl.
The car runs good.
This is my own invention.
A combination of sonic beam and photoelectric cell.
The chance of anyone else hitting on the same code of light and sound impulses is practically non-existent.
I have a whole series throughout my premises.
You sound as proud of them as if they'd won the Nobel.
- Darling.
- Dad, it's so good to see you.
This is Dr. Harrison, Janice, my new colleague.
My daughter Mrs. Roberts, who runs this household with a rod of iron.
Dad.
- How do you do?
- How do you do?
Gramps! Gramps!
Gee willikers, you got here just in time!
Come on in the house, Gramps.
I've got it all figured out.
Gee, I'm glad you're here.
Come on, I gotta show ya!
We have company.
This is my grandson Brian, better known as "Gadge."
He likes gadgets, too...
Perhaps too fondly.
Dr. Harrison, who's going to work with me.
How are you, Brian?
Or may I call you Gadge?
How do you do, sir?
Come on, Gramps, I gotta show you.
- Come on!
- You'll have to excuse me.
This sounds urgent.
He's the grandson.
The father of the boy was killed in Korea six, seven years ago.
The boy is impulsive, but what a brain.
He'll be a greater man than his grandfather.
Look, Gramps.
I told you I had it figured out.
Only first, I gotta make myself as tall as you are.
Up until this moment
I thought I had invented the only burglar-proof lock, with only two people in the world...
Karl and myself...
Sharing the secret of the combination.
And how did you work it out, young man?
Oh, logarithms.
But I never went down there,
Gramps, honest!
Not without you around.
Are you sure, Gadge?
Okay, Gadge. Come on, Ralph.
As long as he has it open,
I may as well show you what's down there.
Can I come, too, Gramps?
No, my friend, you cannot.
And I think it's time you were getting to school.
I'm afraid it is, Gadge.
What's the time?
The time is now
21 and a half minutes past 8.
Okay, okay.
Gimmickses.
Always gimmickses.
Let's get out of here.
Wish I were down there with them.
I wish I knew what Gramps was doing.
I mean, this big job, why won't he tell me?
I guess it's just too important, Gadge.
Nobody knows but Karl.
And now this Harrison guy.
Must be a pretty big job for him not to tell me.
- He never...
- What's that?
Listen.
What is it?
What is if?
Are you sure you Won't change your mind, Gramps?
I'm sorry, Gadge.
You know how much I'd like to have you down there tonight, but I just can't.
But why?
I know just as much about electronics and stuff as those old guys from the newspapers.
They're not just old guys from the newspapers, Gadge.
They're very distinguished scientific journalists representing the most important news services of the world.
I will grant you this.
You do know as much about electronics as they do.
But I still don't see why.
Well, although you have a searching mind and the courage of a grown-up scientist, you look like just what you are...
An 11-year-old boy.
And I'm afraid the people we've invited here tonight under such secrecy might not be adult enough to understand your presence here.
That's why I have to pack you off to bed.
I understand, Gramps.
Good night. Thanks, Gadge.
Well, I guess I won't be needing this anymore.
Well, I see no reason
Why you shouldn't hear what's going on.
Gee willikers! Thanks, Gramps!
Go ahead.
Hey, this is worse than crashing the Pentagon.
When do we get in?
When I've checked all the papers and written down all the numbers.
Go ahead.
All is in order.
Thank you, my friend.
Your place certainly has a lot of charm, Professor.
It certainly does.
It's an amazing location for a laboratory.
How'd you ever find it?
This old wine cellar
was precisely the reason that I bought this place.
It's ideal both for security and to protect our delicate equipment from surface vibrations.
And now I think we'd better get started.
Won't you be seated, gentlemen?
- Mind if I sit here?
- No, please do.
As you know, gentlemen, it is my contention, as well as Dr. Harrison's, that to man the first experimental space ship with a living crew is a useless and unwarranted risk of human life.
The research program so far conducted by the Armed Forces and the Civil interplanetary
Flight Commission have been well planned and executed as far as they go, but they deal only with the easily deducible, obvious hazards of what we call "space"-
cosmic rays, disorientation, weightlessness-
but they cannot guard against the unknown hazards.
Without the results of actual observation and recording of data, no man can possibly know the conditions existing outside the atmospheric envelope of this Earth.
He can only guess.
And to me, the word "guess" cannot, in any circumstances, fit with the word "science."
Now, you say you must have the results of actual observation, yet you're opposed to sending human pilots to get them.
Aren't you talking in contradictions, Professor?
No, Mr. Gilligan, as you will see for yourself.
Well, gentlemen, meet Tobor.
A childish joke of mine...
"robot" spelled backwards.
Well, since this is your invention,
Professor Nordstrom,
I suppose we can be sure this isn't just another movie Frankenstein.
You certainly can.
In fact, the term "robot" is hardly accurate, in spite of my joke.
I would prefer to say an electronic simulacrum of a man.
Oh, gosh! Oh, gee willikers!
Are you trying to tell us that this...
This pile of tin could actually pilot a space ship?
Exactly.
Now, you control this...
This thing from that box by some sort of electronic wavelength or something, right?
At the moment, I do, Mr. Johnston.
Well, how do you know that the wavelength will be powerful enough to work outside the Earth's atmosphere?
I don't, sir.
But that doesn't matter very much because I'm not going to need them there.
You see, Mr. Johnston, this control system is only a temporary expedient to activate Tobor during the early stages of his development.
From this point on, he will be guided by a totally different method.
How about a little fill-in on that, Professor?
You mean something new?
Something we've never heard of?
On the contrary, gentlemen,
I'm sure most of you have heard of it, although I imagine few of you will believe in it.
ESP...
Extra-sensory perception.
You mean that stuff about projecting thought images by telepathy?
Mr. Gilligan, you're not too far off.
In here, gentlemen, is the most intricate part of what I assure you is a highly sensitive mechanism.
When that is activated, like this...
Oh, he looks alive.
That is an illusion, my dear, caused by reflected light in the eye tubes.
And yet, in a way, Tobor is alive, for even though much work remains before he's completed, he is already a sentient being.
The sentience may be synthetic, but it's there nonetheless...
A necessary adjunct to the recording of all experiences our human space crews may later encounter.
A sentient being?
You mean this-this thing can feel?
Well, let me put it in another way.
Even in his present unfinished state,
Tobor will react to emotional stimuli.
Janice, help me with a little experiment, will you?
Gentlemen, I assure you there's no collusion here.
I'm merely going to ask Mrs. Roberts to approach Tobor and feel friendliness toward him...
Think goodwill, as it were.
You can do that, can't you, Janice?
I'll try.
All right, then. Go ahead.
Just don't make any gestures.
Just hold the friendship thought.
I think he does look almost kind, doesn't he?
Thank you, Janice.
Could you get a reaction from some other emotion, Professor?
And from a stranger.
Say from Johnston, here.
I think we could manage to do that.
But Why don't you make the experiment, Mr. Gilligan?
Do you suppose you can contrive to... feel enmity toward Tobor?
Yeah, I suppose so.
Yeah, sure I could.
Very well, then.
Suppose you'll get up and... take one of those fire axes from the wall.
Now, if you will, walk around behind Tobor.
And hold the thought of enmity all the time.
Deadly enmity.
Well, there you have it, gentlemen.
This time, the emotional stimulus was danger, the reaction fear, instantly followed by anger.
You have just witnessed the complete cycle of a synthetic instinct-self-preservation.
I have a question, Professor.
Now, you've persistently referred to the fact that this... this robot...
Tobor, Mr. Johnston.
You'd better use his name or he might resent you.
Well, I'm sorry.
I'll rephrase that.
Why do you keep saying that Tobor is still incomplete?
For the simple reason,
Mr. Johnston, that we have not yet perfected his long-range communication system.
As you know, gentlemen, at each end of such a system, there's a power unit...
A transmitter and a receiver.
Here is our receiver, Tobor himself.
When he is switched from direct to infinite control, he's capable of receiving thought impulses over any conceivable span.
It is only the transmitter which Dr. Harrison and I are in process of perfecting.
How about giving us a look at his innards, Professor?
Oh, or are they top secret, too?
I don't mind if Tobor doesn't.
And now, gentlemen,
I think I've said everything I can say of importance tonight.
And it's certainly Tobor's bedtime.
I gotta see Tobor.
I just gotta.
Just a minute, Mr. Gilligan.
I'm not questioning your integrity as a journalist, Mr. Gilligan.
I'm simply requesting again that you confine your coverage to the facts contained in Professor Nordstrom's handout.
Now, look, Doc, we don't tell you how to run your job.
I realize that, Mr. Gilligan.
But your papers aren't exactly famous for their conservative handling of the news.
Now just a minute.
That's the trouble with you scientists.
You won't face up to the facts of life.
Ralph, I have to put my car away.
Would you give me a hand with the garage door?
I'd like to.
Very much.
Gee, Tobor... you're beautiful.
Glad you could make it, gentlemen.
Good-bye.
Okay. They're all out.
Very good.
I gotta figure it out.
I Just gotta!
It's Gadge! I'll bet he's doing it!
Gadge.
That little so-and-so.
Do you realize what he did?
He actually worked out all those controls and got Tobor back in his box all within five minutes.
Oh, Dad, you're wonderful.
But he was bad, very bad.
You go to bed, Janice.
Ralph and Karl and I will get this rubbish all squared away.
- Good night.
- Good night, darling.
Beats me how that kid worked out those controls.
I'd hate to try it with a slide rule.
I told you that boy's a genius.
Hey, Wait a minute.
9, 10, 11, 12, 13.
How many news services did we ask to send representatives tonight, Professor?
Twelve, as you know.
Why?
Because there are 13 empty chairs, and tonight every one of them was filled.
A 1953 black Ford sedan.
License number 9Y-33-26.
That's the last number on the list, Sheriff.
Professor Nordstrom's man was instructed to admit all newsmen showing a proper letter of accreditation.
Unfortunately, the professor omitted to tell him just how many were expected, so that 13th letter must have been a forgery.
Incidentally, Sheriff,
I'd appreciate it if you'd pass those license numbers on to the FBI.
No. No, we won't be needing your deputies to guard us.
We're taking our own precautions, and Professor Nordstrom assures me that they're more than adequate.
Thanks again, Sheriff.
Good-bye.
Twenty-two university degrees and I forget to tell Karl the number of letters.
No Wonder they tell jokes about absent-minded professors.
Well, that's spilled milk now.
At least we're alerted that somebody is mighty curious about Tobor.
Let's hope that those precautions of yours are rugged enough to keep them out.
Well, that, at least, I can guarantee.
Come on, Karl.
Let's check the wiring.
Gimmickses. Always gimmickses.
I wish someone would tell me exactly who or what
We're guarding against.
Well, we built the basic emotional patterns for a constructive mission into Tobor.
Just think what would happen if someone else...
Some potential enemy...
Built destructive patterns into a few thousand like him.
What a terrifying thought.
Anything new?
They still haven't posted a guard.
Hmm. Are you sure?
It's been four days now and I haven't seen a soul.
You must have got away with it.
Might be a trap.
Well, how do we play it, then?
Wait for a break?
Unfortunately, my friend, we haven't much time.
The highest party officials are concerned.
They fear that once Nordstrom has perfected his control system, the federal government will take over.
It will be considerably more difficult for us to get at it.
- And so?
- So we get into the house...
That's better.
See, I... I rigged the telepathic pickup so that it fits behind the ear
Where it's close to the sensory brain centers.
It conveys every impulse to the control device here
Where you can increase or diminish the vibrations.
The whole thing fits as comfortably as a hearing aid.
Excellent, Ralph. Excellent.
Now, here's the transmitter receiver.
I moved the tuning band to this end.
Beautiful.
Now it's all set. You want to start?
I think you ought to operate these tests, Ralph.
This whole new system is your work.
- No, no. You go ahead.
- All right.
I worked on a series of reaction tests.
Here they are.
Here we go.
All right.
That's all I could think of for him to say.
Who the devil's that?
Gadge, what are you doing down here?
I heard you Working Tobor.
Can I come and watch?
You seem to be here already.
All right.
Okay, Ralph, black out the screen.
Let's see how he adapts himself to the sonar compass.
Attaboy, Tobor.
That's using your coordinator.
So far, so good.
I wonder how he'd take to the white hot meteorites.
This is a tough one, Gadge.
They're coming at him fast now.
I hope he can take it.
I don't like this.
Watch 'em. Watch 'em.
The thing's gone berserk.
Cut it off.
No, stop, Tobor!
Gadge!
Are you all right, boy?
There's no fracture, just a bad bump.
Come on, son.
Easy, Gadge.
There you are.
You darn old Tobor.
You better Watch out.
Easy, Gadge.
Tobor can't hurt us now.
I wonder exactly what happened?
I think Tobor suffered what in a human being would be a nervous breakdown.
Those meteors came at him so fast that he couldn't take it.
I think you're right.
I think all we have to do is to insulate against overloading the receptors.
If we do that, maybe we'll jump the last hurdle.
What are you doing now?
I'm switching him on again.
His receptors must have cooled off by now.
Let's see if he's still functioning.
You're all right now, Tobor.
Next time, you better watch where you're going.
There's another one of
Tobor's synthetic instincts, concern for the young, race preservation.
Or to put it less academically, human love.
Okay, Tobor.
I guess you didn't know what you were doing.
2.50 even, lady.
Thanks.
Okay, just another customer.
Will you be through shortly?
Another half hour oughta do it.
Good.
Soon I'll have to leave to fetch Dr. Gustav.
When do we make our move?
Not before midnight.
Perhaps later.
Depends on the house being dark.
Great, works fine.
Everything is ready, Doctor.
I am a man of science, not of action. I...
This is your duty.
All you have to do is to inspect and photograph this work of Nordstrom's.
Leave everything else to us.
Paul, you go first.
Max, you follow us.
Intruders now inside electrified fence.
North boundary.
Intruders now inside electrified fence.
Gramps! Ralph! Karl!
I brought my.22.
Hit camera number 6, Karl.
That oughta show 'em up.
It's amazing how this television camera of yours can photograph at night without lights.
Not television, infravision.
Hit camera number 8, Karl.
Now.
What is that?
Who's shooting?
No one is.
That's a recorded soundtrack from a movie studio...
Right out of
The Sands of Iwo Jima.
Let's go.
Come on.
Gadge. Gadge, come back here.
Gadge!
Too bad. They got away.
You shouldn't have pushed me, Ralph.
I would've had him.
A smart cookie, that Nordstrom.
Too smart for us, maybe.
He mustn't be.
I needn't remind you our employers will not tolerate any more failures on your part, nor mine.
Well, what do we do now?
We think, my friend.
Or, rather, I think.
And this is what I think.
Since we cannot get in to see
Nordstrom's secrets for ourselves, we must induce him to come out and tell them to us.
It's a tall order, I would say.
Not necessarily.
There must be a vulnerable spot.
Of course.
Nordstrom worships his grandson.
The grandson worships...
Gee willikers.
Mom! Hey, Mom!
Hey, Watch it.
You better blow your horn at those intersections, Gadge.
Gee, I'm sorry, Mom, but look. Lookit.
Oh, wonderful.
What day is it?
Let's see...
It's Tuesday.
And who's going to be your friend?
Well, I'd like to invite you, Mom, but I doubt if you understand this sort of thing.
Oh, no, I suppose not.
Well, guess Gramp's my only man.
I'll go see him right away.
Good. Now Tobor can turn his own switch on or off when he's called.
Better he should learn to clean the house and drive the car so I can spend all my time making toys for you to play with.
It's all finished.
A new transmitter rod built inside a pencil.
You made it beautifully, Karl.
But for what?
That you can play schoolboy tricks on very important people when you show Tobor off tonight.
Gimickses.
Sorry to disturb you, Professor, but I thought you'd want me to remind you about your date with Gadge for the planetarium.
What's the matter with me these days?
Gadge. Gadge, Where are you, boy?
We oughta be going.
Right with you, Gramps.
Now, don't be late.
Your very important persons will be here at 7:00 sharp, remember?
Oh, we'll be back an hour before that.
You mark my Words.
Ah, here you are partner.
Come on, let's hit the trail.
Funny. Where... Where's everyone else?
Probably inside. Come on, Gramps.
Well, Gramps, I think there's something Wrong.
You think so?
It's the right day.
Yes, young man.
The right day... for us.
If you please.
But something must've happened.
I know Dad's careless about time, but he wouldn't be an hour late, not tonight.
I still think he had a flat tire, or he ran out of gas.
No, you don't.
That's what you hope happened.
Oh, Ralph, I'm Worried.
All right, I'll phone the sheriff's office.
That's the press.
I'll phone from down in the lab.
You meet them and just tell them he'll be a little late.
Come on, now, snap out of it.
I'll be all right.
- Good evening, General.
- Good evening.
- Good evening, sir.
- Good evening.
- How are you?
- How are you?
How do you do?
Gramps. Gramps. You all right?
Yes, I'm fine. How about you?
I'm okay.
Have you quite recovered, Professor
Nordstrom?
I'm fully conscious, if that's what you mean.
And, therefore, able to understand your position?
Completely, I assure you.
Perhaps not as completely as you think.
Of course, as a man of intelligence, you have realized that you are obviously here to talk.
But you may not have anticipated what happens if you don't.
I'm sorry, but you'll have to raise your voice a little.
I said you may not have anticipated what happens if you don't.
Something very unpleasant,
I should say, judging by the look of you and your friends.
Yes, very unpleasant.
But to whom?
That's my point.
Don't you tell 'em, Gramps.
Please, don't you tell 'em.
You shut your mouth.
Don't look for trouble, Gadge.
You seem to have me over a barrel.
I take it you want the formula for my extra sensory transmission method.
Very well.
Do I tell them to you or write them down or what?
You will not have the opportunity to give us double-talk, Professor.
You will have to relay your discoveries to a colleague almost as distinguished as yourself.
How do you do, sir?
I'm sorry I can't get up to greet you.
How do you do, Professor?
Oh, please forgive me.
My doctor told me only this week that I was getting a little deaf.
Uh, my pocket, if you please.
Put that over my head, behind my ear, please.
Ah, that's much better.
And so, gentlemen,
I'm afraid the question of Whether Tobor is capable of guiding a multistage rocket across interstellar space is highly debatable, let alone his being able to deal with all the emergency situations of such a journey.
I don't know, Mr. Commissioner.
After all, We've had automatic pilots on both conventional aircraft and guided missiles since the middle of World War Il.
What do you think, Congressman?
Well, all I can say, sir, is the motto of one of the greatest states in our union is "show me," and that's exactly what
Professor Nordstrom will have to do.
I couldn't agree with you more.
Automatic pilots are one thing.
Intelligent direction of a billion-dollar space cruiser is something else.
Yes?
Yes, I see.
Thank you, Sheriff.
Let me know if you hear anything.
A moment, please, gentlemen.
It's no good trying to keep it from you any longer.
About Professor Nordstrom's failure to be here...
Frankly, we don't know where he is.
He and his grandson left early today, presumably to visit a science show at the Planetarium in Los Angeles.
They were to be back at 5:30.
That was the sheriff's office on the phone.
They have no news of Professor Nordstrom, or the boy.
Neither has the Los Angeles Police
Department nor the FBI and there was no science show scheduled at the Planetarium today.
Well, isn't there something we can do instead of just standing around?
Afraid not, except wait.
Now, these principles, you must understand, had to be reduced to a Working form.
If I could jot down the basic equations, it would save us a lot of time.
Is that correct, Doctor?
Most certainly.
Very well. Paul, release his hands.
I strongly advise you, Doctor, to confine yourself to the matter in hand.
Pencil and paper.
Gramps, don't you do it!
Please, don't you tell 'em!
Lie still, Gadge. Don't try to get up.
If you please.
Certainly. As soon as I can Write.
Another pencil.
I have another one right here.
Let's see, there'll be six cars altogether.
We'll assign one square to each car.
What's the matter?
- What is it? Anything Wrong?
- Listen.
Well, Dad must've come back.
No, I don't think so.
I don't understand this, Harrison.
What's operating the thing?
Somehow, wherever he is,
Nordstrom's controlling Tobor.
It's the gimmick I fixed.
The pencil.
Let's follow him in the cars.
Something wrong, Doctor?
Yes, I think so.
This figure, it cannot be correct.
Oh, I'm sorry. Just a slip.
This is the third slip you've made, Nordstrom.
I'm very sorry.
I am trying to remember an extremely complicated formula.
I should have my notes.
Of course, I could stimulate your memory with artificial methods.
Come.
Open up his shirt.
So far it is good, Professor, but it's only a promise.
Now we come to the big step, yes?
Yes, in a minute.
But first, hadn't we better go over the data again, to make sure?
Professor, you seem to forget that I was present when you said that you hadn't yet perfected the long distance transmitter for Tobor.
Could it be that you've solved that problem so soon?
You better use mine and use it quick.
I Won't stand for this any longer.
You'll give the required information immediately.
Wait! Wait!
Don't, Gramps! Don't!
All right! You win.
The transmitting power's been out off.
Isn't there anything you can do?
I don't know.
Maybe one chance.
If Gadge and the professor are near this spot, they may be able to reach him on a direct telepathic impulse.
Tobor, please come get us.
Please come and get us, Tobor.
Now he is cooperating.
What's that?
Come on, Tobor! Come on!
- Are you all right?
- Yes.
Where's Gadge?
Over there.
You were saying, Mr. Commissioner, just as that phone rang, that you doubted that Tobor was capable of reacting to emergency situations.
I'm afraid I was, but I Withdraw my observation.
Gee, Tobor, you're wonderful.
Good-bye, Tobor.
And good luck.
For centuries the prayers of Mexico's peasants...
...have been their only shield against the devastating furies...
...that have wrecked their homes and destroyed their lives.
And so today, again, they kneel...
...terrified and helpless as a new volcano is created...
...by the mysterious and rebellious forces of nature.
The earth has split a thousand times.
Whole acres of rich farmland have cracked and dropped from sight...
...and millions of tons of molten lava are roaring down the slopes...
...in a quake recorded on the seismograph of the University of Mexico...
...as the most violent of modern times.
To the benighted citizenry of this remote countryside...
...the most alarming aspect of the phenomenon...
...is the fact that its unabated hourly growth is without precedence...
...having reached a towering height of 9000 feet within a few days...
...and with each added foot, it spreads its evil onslaught into a wider circumference.
But what is now most feared is that rescue work will be severely hampered...
...by the hazardous inaccessibility of the terrain.
Well, there she is.
Yeah.
How much further do you suppose, doc?
Three days on this washboard and that volcano looks as far away as it ever did.
Nobody stuck a gun in your back to make you become a geologist.
Yeah, but you don't have to rub it in.
"San Lorenzo, 12 kilometers."
If there was any other village within 50 miles...
...a sign like this could confuse people.
It looks like somebody else has been here.
Yeah, army truck, maybe. Police.
Don't get me wrong, doc.
I love this Mexico of yours...
...but up around here,
I think I could stand a little company.
For my information, Hank, how did you get permission so fast?
From my group, I mean.
After all, red tape and that sort of thing.
Simple. I just told them the truth:
That you needed me along as an interpreter.
That may be true, but I think the language you really spoke best...
...was with our secretary who secured all the documents for you.
I didn't use Spanish with her.
That was sign language.
Incredible. Truly, isn't it?
If these estimates are right, this quake may be as severe as Mount Pelée...
...Vesuvius, San Francisco.
Lucky there are so few people up here.
Well, there were enough.
- Hello.
- Hi.
- How far you come, fellas?
- Mexico City.
- We left on Monday.
- Where do you want to go?
San Lorenzo. How far is it?
Do you know?
Who knows how the bridges are.
Maybe a couple of hours.
A police car went by just before sundown.
They didn't come back, so maybe they got through okay.
Was San Lorenzo hurt badly?
Who knows? The telephone lines are down since the earthquake.
- Thanks a lot. See you later.
- Take it easy.
- What the devil was that?
- I don't know.
Ordinarily, I've got nothing against moonlight nights...
...but I'll be glad to get by this one.
It looks like a farmhouse up ahead.
Maybe we can get some water up there.
I hope so. I'd like to save those last two bottles of beer.
Well, no gas station ever looked better.
- Hello?
- Anybody home?
I'll see if I can find a well.
Hey, hello in there.
I wonder if we can have some water for our jeep.
- Hey, Hank!
- Yeah?
Come here!
Look at this.
Over here too.
What do you suppose...?
Look at that!
What do you make of it?
It must be that patrol car those telephone men saw...
...but I certainly have no idea what could have happened or why.
What could do this to a car out here?
You don't suppose they're trying to walk to San Lorenzo?
511. Calling 511. Do you read me?
Sergeant Vega, do you read me?
This is headquarters calling 511.
Hello. Hello, do you read me?
511, I read you, Sergeant Vega.
What's your location? Sergeant Vega?
Here, you better take this.
You're head man down here.
- Hello.
- Go ahead, please.
This is Arturo Ramos, professor of geology from the university.
My associate and I came upon this patrol car. There has been an accident.
I believe we're a few kilometers south of the village of San Lorenzo.
- Where's Sergeant Vega?
- He's not here. No one is here.
The car is badly damaged, but there's no blood.
- Did the car run off the road?
- No. Frankly it...
Didn't the sergeant make a report after the accident?
- The radio's working.
- We have heard nothing.
Thank you, professor.
Leave the patrol car as it is.
We shall order military intelligence to send a unit to San Lorenzo immediately.
We will.
Well, we're not doing any good here, pal.
Hank, some of my countrymen may like rattlesnakes in the house.
- I can do without them.
- Let's take a look.
That rattlesnake is the worst kind of them all.
Come on, fella. There you go.
You've had practice, Mr. Scott?
I guess so, with four brothers and two sisters.
What do you suppose caused this wreck?
That police car out there?
It could've been a bull.
If it was, it had to be the grandpappy of the biggest bull that ever was.
Hank?
You did notice the beans were still hot on the stove?
- Yep.
- So?
When I've already got a dozen questions
I can't answer...
...I try to ignore any new ones.
Do you think we ought to radio them about the kid?
Nope, I think we ought to get to
San Lorenzo as quick as we can.
Look at that kid.
Not a peep out of him.
If I ever have any of my own,
I'll feed them beans and tortillas too.
Then I'll be able to get some sleep nights.
Hey, wait a minute.
Every cartridge has been fired.
Hello. Hello? We only found
Sergeant Vega and the baby.
I have that, professor. Right. You said
Vega's revolver had all chambers fired.
Yes. All.
- At what?
- We wish we knew too.
Thank you again. The emergency unit will be in San Lorenzo tomorrow.
- Right.
- That's all.
We're from Mexico City. We're from Mexico
City. We're scientists. Is the mayor here?
Hernando, rest for a day or two.
Rosa, don't let him try to do too much.
Father! Father! They come.
Padre Delgado, the road is open.
- Help is here.
- From Mexico City.
At last, thank God.
Ask them in Spanish.
Welcome to San Lorenzo.
I am Father Delgado.
Arturo Ramos, of the university.
Dr. Henry Scott, from the United States.
- I'm afraid I can't introduce this one.
- Manuel Tiburcio! And the parents?
They weren't there. I think it might be better if we discuss this inside, Father.
Dead! They were dead!
And now, Father, do you believe there is a demon bull...
...killing us all one by one?
- Perla!
I'll take Manuel. I'll take him with me.
But I will not protect him from the devil just by lighting candles!
Gentlemen, I know you are weary after your journey.
Can I offer you what hospitality the village may provide?
Thank you, Father.
That car, Father, just pushed in as though it were paper.
And finding the sergeant with a look of death none of us had ever seen before.
- Then this isn't the first time?
- The first Sunday after the eruption...
...various of the congregation were not in church.
This is understandable, you realize, travel might have been impossible.
Then the Tiburcio family simply vanished.
The farm, as you have described, ravished as by some giant being.
- But there were no bodies.
- None until last Thursday.
Since then, a young girl.
She was crossing the field to spend that night...
...with cousins, was found in the morning.
Horrible.
And the Dominguez brothers, ranchers...
...were discovered in a gully with that look of horror on their faces...
...and no blood.
It's small consolation, Father, I admit...
...but as a scientist, I know where the effects are so similar...
...there must be a simple, logical cause.
I wonder how simple, Dr. Ramos, or how logical.
Father, what about that story about the demon bull?
That seems like a strange superstition.
Oh, the demon bull is a symbol of evil among many ancient civilizations.
About two days ago, all the workmen on the big Miraflores ranch...
...that's a huge estate on the other side of the foothills...
...decided to leave their work and come here to San Lorenzo.
Now, these men, usually frightened of nothing...
...said they wouldn't work there a day longer.
- They brought the tale of the demon bull.
- Has Miraflores been attacked also?
Cattle had been found dead in various areas of the ranch.
They hadn't been rounded up yet this year.
And for miles around, cowboys came upon one dead steer after another.
One of them had heard the tale of the demon bull of the Maricopa.
Now, gentlemen, I do not believe it, but it is as good an explanation as any other one.
Well, I'd like to think that our research up here might be of some help.
As do I, but this is no time to begin.
I know you're exhausted from your journey and listening to me.
Tonight you'll stay here, and maybe in the morning, things won't seem so mysterious.
Indeed, I hope so.
Here we are isolated, almost cut off from civilization...
...having lost family or friends to something absolutely unknown.
We could be in another world.
- Good night, Father.
- Good night.
Thank you for everything, Father.
- We really appreciate it.
- That's all right.
See you later this afternoon.
Dr. Ramos, Dr. Scott...
...I will ask you one more time not to begin this unnecessary expedition.
Major Cosio, we have answered all your questions.
- I don't see how we can be of any service.
- No, I don't require you for my work here.
I only know that if you start for that crater and find yourself in any difficulties...
...men who are much more badly needed here will have to go find you.
I'm sorry.
So that's why you must come back safely, and before sundown...
...with all the answers to your questions and mine.
Now you've got me.
What do you say, doc? Shall we try around over that side, or over here?
Neither one of them looks exactly like a Pan-American highway.
Everyone's always said that the best fissures are on the eastern slope.
You can see the lava there.
Maybe we can get close enough to get some pictures and plan our best approach.
You see a trail up around those rocks?
I don't know about that, but I've found something a lot more interesting.
- So?
- So?
Sí, sí, señor. Here, have a look.
It'll do you more good than that bottled water.
Ah, yes. Now I see him.
Doc, you haven't got that thing in focus.
They're focused...
...and it's a handsome horse, and I'd like to get started.
Horse?
There was a girl on that horse!
Come on, we've gotta get started and find her.
Now, don't move too much.
I said don't move.
We've got to find out if you're all right first.
Oh, I'm all right, really.
Except I could have been more graceful if I'd known spectators were around.
- Don't worry about that.
- Gently, now.
No broken bones, señorita? No sharp pains?
No, really, I'm all right.
I've fallen off Lucero before.
Not for many years, but...
I really can ride, gentlemen.
I'm Teresa Alvarez, of Miraflores.
Hank Scott.
Dr. Arturo Ramos.
The luck of the Alvarez. Tumble off a horse and land right next to a doctor.
Doctors of geology. We operate only with little hammers on rocks.
How about the horse?
I saw him gallop off.
Oh, don't bother.
Lucero always goes back to Miraflores...
...but, the saddle, I don't know...
- I'll get it.
- You're very kind.
- No bother at all.
- Do you happen to have a canteen?
- Oh, sure. Right on the jeep. Come on.
- There's a mirror you can use.
- Great.
Well, we'll be here several weeks at least.
We're conducting a sort of preliminary survey...
...and then the other boys will join us here next month.
You make it sound like a very intriguing occupation.
Oh, it is. You meet such interesting volcanoes.
Hey, Hank!
Thank you, doctor.
I ought to thank you.
I found this near the saddle.
- Oh, is that good?
- I'll say it is. It's obsidian.
That's lava that's cooled.
Well, I wouldn't know.
Cattle, yes, but rocks...
- Could I ask another favor of you?
- Well, sure.
Would you mind taking me back to San Lorenzo?
- Be glad to.
- Thank you.
I must get there today.
The telephone isn't working, and I have to hire some riders to help with my cattle.
That old volcano is really causing a lot of trouble this time.
Yeah, we heard in the village about your cowboys.
Well, if I lose my cattle, I lose everything.
- How are things in San Lorenzo?
- Oh, so-so.
I don't know what's gotten into my vaqueros at Miraflores.
So there was an earthquake...
...and the cattle started eating some poisonous weed we haven't learned of yet.
Is that any reason to act like frightened children?
I don't think it's just a poisonous plant, señorita.
You don't grow them that can push in the side of a building and wreck a car.
Oh, don't forget. You've promised to use Miraflores as your headquarters.
It will be a great convenience, señorita.
- Then we'll meet later?
- Right.
Chamoco, Felipe, Jose.
All of you.
Let me ask you this.
If your patron, my father, were alive today...
...would you be frightened of sounds in the night and run like children to the village?
- Señorita Teresa, I understand you need us.
- I say only this, muchachos.
I have known you all for all my life.
We have always worked together.
- Many of you were born at Miraflores.
- That's right.
If you don't wish to return just to help me save my cattle for me...
...then return to save Miraflores.
- We'll return.
- Gracias.
Dr. Ramos. Dr. Scott.
- Major Cosio wants to see you.
- Where is he?
- In the laboratory with Dr. Delacruz.
- Laboratory?
You'd be surprised at the experiments that go on there.
- Where is it?
- This way.
Doctor, is that the patrolman?
Yes, Sergeant Vega...
...who lived doing his duty and who may perform a greater one now.
Please.
Well?
Looked like subcutaneous cells that had just burst or run rampant.
My analysis also, Dr. Scott.
Not from any poison I can identify with this equipment.
Lopez, your help again, please.
In this, pure alcohol.
In this, distilled water.
In this, tequila.
In this, water with so much salt.
- You think it is a poison, then?
- I do.
Not a chemical poison, doctor?
No, but I believe for many reasons that this is an organic poison.
I have had a little experience with them:
The venoms of the snakes, the wasps, the spiders.
But I will prepare the slides and the specimens...
...and take them to a man in Mexico City who will be sure to know.
- Velasco?
- You know Velasco?
Who doesn't, doctor?
Well, as you say, if it's an organic poison...
...anything from nature, the great Velasco will identify it.
You said for many reasons.
What other reasons?
Well, there was only one wound. Here.
But no blood.
Then the situation of the tissues, the strange bacteria...
...bacteria I think, found in the soil samples near the footprints.
- Footprints?
- Footprints?
You are amazed.
Where something knocks down dwellings, flattens corn fields...
...it would be amazing if there were no footprints.
I never saw a moulage of a print this size.
Whatever it is, my friends...
...I don't believe anyone has ever seen a foot, a claw this size...
...except those poor unfortunates who wish they never had.
- One question, doctor.
- I hope I can answer it.
Well, the alcohol, the distilled water, the salt solution, I can understand that...
...but what's the tequila for?
Well, in your country,
I believe you call it a coffee break.
- There's the hacienda.
- Hey, that really looks like quite a place.
It looks like you were pretty lucky.
That thing really came close.
Yes. We were blessed that it didn't go any further...
...or our plantation would have been ruined like the rest of the land.
Señorita, thank heaven you're safe.
When Lucero came back to the stables without you, I began to search the hills.
Oh, Pio, I'd already been found by someone else.
This is Dr. Scott and Dr. Ramos.
- This is my foreman, Pio.
- Hi, Pio.
This way.
Not only comfortable, but cool too.
Yes, sometimes I think being cool is by far the most important on days like this.
Well, I know you'll want showers.
Florentina, show Dr. Ramos to the Blue Room.
Sí, señorita.
And Juanito, you show Dr. Scott to the left wing.
I'll take care of them.
Well, I'll see you later, and you can tell me all about your expedition.
Not bad, doc.
For half a day's work, Chamoco, not bad.
- Tell the boys.
- Yes, Pio, yes.
We get them all brought in by Thursday.
Why put on such a face?
We will do it if I have to stay in the saddle without sleep myself.
Pio, don't you understand?
Can't you see the cattle know that something evil is carried in the wind.
- Let us wait, Pio.
- Old women, Chamoco.
Now let us have a good supper and forget these superstitions.
Would you like some brandy, sir?
- Yes, thank you.
- Just a minute.
Juanito, hurry with the brandy.
- Would you like some too?
- Please.
I'll take care of them.
Muchas gracias.
May I make a complaint, Teresa?
Oh, I'm sorry. What was not done suitably?
Well, that's just it.
Everything was done beautifully.
You know, you're making it very difficult to think about settling down to work.
- Well, is that so bad?
- That all depends.
It might be very bad if I stopped thinking about work altogether...
...and just started concentrating on pleasure.
Hank, those volcanoes have been there for hundreds of years.
I'm sure they wouldn't mind waiting just a little longer.
I didn't expect you two to be discussing volcanoes.
I've got something to show you.
I noticed it last night at the village.
See anything? Hold it up against the light.
That's fantastic, doc.
Why, there's a scorpion trapped in there.
I think so. A few hundred years old, but there he is.
I wanted to show it to you before I broke it open.
Alive!
Lmpossible! Juanito, bring a jar.
- Life enduring for centuries like this.
- And under all that heat!
Velasco will certainly be interested in this.
Here, Juanito.
Pardon me, señores.
Do you like to keep scorpions?
I know a place where there are millions.
Not like this one, Juanito.
Pancho.
Pancho, if you don't know how to behave,
I have to send you out.
I want a magnifying glass to watch this little monster.
I could throw this scorpion out the window, and we'd really be alone.
It's simpler than that.
Why don't we go outside?
Why don't we?
Oh, excuse me, the line's been fixed.
- Hello. Hello.
- Hacienda Miraflores? Just testing the line.
- Oh, is the line all fixed?
- All clear, ma'am.
Miraflores was the last one, señora.
- Gaetano!
- What?
What's under the bridge?
No, in the arroyo!
Hank, come here.
Listen to this.
Hello. Hello.
- Hello, what's wrong?
- Look out!
Run, Gaetano. Get to the truck.
- Where's the arroyo bridge?
- I'll show you.
Pancho, what's happening to you tonight? Keep quiet.
Doc, we have to go to the bridge.
There's some trouble.
And you be a good boy.
Come back here! Pancho!
Pancho, come back here.
Pancho! Pancho! Pancho, come back here!
Pancho, what's the matter with you tonight?
Pancho, come back!
I'll get you.
Señorita.
- What's wrong with the cattle, Pio?
- I cannot say.
- Help, Mr. Hank!
- That's Juanito.
Run, Juanito!
Give me your gun. Call for help.
- It's a gigantic scorpion.
- Where is Juanito?
He's safe.
Operator. Operator. Operator!
Please, hurry, operator!
- I shot at that thing a dozen times.
- Must be after the cattle.
- Mr. Hank.
- Juanito, come on, quick.
Teresa, Florentina, come on into the jeep. Quick.
- Dr. Velasco.
- Dr. Ramos, I hoped I'd find you here.
This is fantastic.
- Dr. Velasco...
- Thank God, Father.
We thought you were all dead.
This is all that remains.
Even the animals.
I cannot speak of this night.
Eaten. Devoured.
I have been sent here in charge of emergency arrangements.
- All that are left will be moved to safety.
- Certainly.
Tell everyone to be ready to leave San Lorenzo.
Father, they may only take what they can carry in their arms.
- Very well.
- Where is the laboratory?
It's over there.
As soon as I received the samples,
I identified the poison...
...as that of a scorpion, but I had no concept of the creature's size...
...until I saw this.
And this.
This specimen found by Dr. Ramos...
...is of a species thought to be extinct since the Triassian era.
We have known it in a fossil state, but never alive.
Now from the bowels of the earth, it has come forth again to plague the earth.
What can we do? I emptied the machine gun at one of them.
I beg of you all, not to lose your head...
...in any sense of the word. But we have a few advantages against this enemy.
First, they come out to eat only at night.
Thus we have the daylight hours to try to find and destroy them.
Secondly, they are somewhat slow and lethargic...
...until inflamed by the smell of blood.
- I still ask one question, sir.
- Yes?
- What weapon do you intend to use?
- Gas. Poison gas.
It has been proved effective against normal species.
Let us pray it works against the Scorpionida rex.
If it does not...
...may God help all of you.
- Be ready at dawn.
- Is that all of them, lieutenant?
I want to do what I can too.
Señorita Alvarez,
I understand your emotions.
Believe me,
I'm not trying to be emotional.
- I wouldn't ask if I couldn't help.
- You don't know the hardships.
Dr. Velasco, Major Cosio, I know this area like the palm of my hand...
...better than any man here.
I'm a good shot.
You said yourself, you needed all the help you could get.
Señorita Alvarez, I think you have found yourself a job.
Gentlemen...
...Major Cosio and I are planning this.
Note where the various incidents have occurred.
I want to go with you.
I want to do a job.
Don't worry, Juanito.
We'll get together again.
That's a promise.
See if you can find my boots for me, will you?
I know where they are.
- Here they are.
- Oh, good.
They are very, very fine boots.
You kind of like those, huh?
Tell you what, Juanito...
...when you get to be a big man,
I'll get you a pair just like these.
- I thank you, Mr. Hank.
- You like that, huh?
I know how to ride very good.
I know how to shoot very good.
I'm 7 and 1/2 years old.
That's almost a half a man.
"A half a man"?
Oh, Juanito, you know sometimes even a half a man...
...has a lot of different jobs to do.
The most important job for you to do is to take care of your grandmother.
She can take care of herself.
I know, but you've got plenty of time to do more exciting things.
And you. You be very careful and don't get hurt, won't you?
Don't worry, I promise.
And a full man never break his promise.
Okay.
Oh, I don't see a thing, Dr. Velasco.
Might as well go on.
All right.
Major.
- Yes.
- Tell your captain to hold...
...all the heavy equipment until we call for it.
Okay, doctor.
- Here it is, a great big opening.
- I guess he found it, Dr. Velasco.
Yes.
Look, there's something wrong with his horse. He's falling in!
Let's hurry up there, Hank.
Come on, let's go.
We must get down to the lower level.
This crevice is new. It must have opened during one of the earthquakes.
- This looks like a job for us, doc.
- Of course.
No chance for Mendoza?
How deep do you say it is?
Doc and I have been down many a cave...
...but there's no way of really telling until you actually hit bottom.
The only way we can find out is to go down there ourselves.
- What do you say, doc?
- Right.
Will that poisonous gas work in a crevice this big?
I could not anticipate such a void as this.
It may dissipate.
Major, I think you better bring all your heavy equipment up here:
Crane, tanks and all.
Captain, bring the crane and all the heavy equipment.
You want my men to go down there?
- It's suicide.
- Don't worry about it.
Doc and I haven't had a decent elevator ride in a long time.
Hank, please, no.
- What are you doing here?
- I'm a stowaway.
Juanito, do me a favor, will you, and just stay out of the way?
- Yes, Mr. Hank.
- Good.
And just sit in the jeep like a big boy, okay?
- Put these in the cage.
- Why the birds, professor?
If the birds stop singing, that means there's poison gas in the cave.
Hank, you don't have to do it.
Neither of you. It's not your responsibility.
Whose responsibility is it?
The police, the army, the people who live here.
Now, look, doc and I know more about caves than anyone else here.
- Why did you do that?
- Maybe I just wanted to see what you'd do.
- What did I do?
- You did all right.
Señorita...
...you can help keep the log of the descent.
How many meters down, the reports which are made...
Sure, keep yourself busy. That's my theory.
Oh, and don't forget to take care of little Juanito.
All right, take it down.
Doc, look down there.
Stop. Stop the cage a minute.
Stop.
Hank, are you all right?
It's the head of a scorpion in the wall.
Hold on a second.
- Okay, I got a picture of it. Lower on.
- All right, lower them down.
We've just hit bottom.
We're in a huge cavern.
I've never seen a cave so big in my life.
- Can you see any signs of Mendoza?
- No, not from here.
We'll take a look around.
- Well, the birds seem all right.
- Yeah.
Are you there, Hank?
Hank, answer.
Are you there, Hank?
Dr. Ramos. Dr. Ramos.
Hello. Hello.
Hello.
- Hello.
- Yes.
Mendoza's dead.
- We just saw a worm 30 feet long.
- Hank, please come up.
- Hank.
- No, we wanna look around a little more.
Hey, doc.
Over here.
- There must be a nest full of them.
- Yeah.
- It doesn't even penetrate it.
- Try another one.
No, wait.
That must be the granddaddy of them all.
That's how they kill each other, that spot in the throat.
That must be it.
Mr. Hank!
Help! Help!
Help!
Help!
Mr. Hank!
- It's Juanito.
- Help!
Help.
Mr. Hank, help!
Help!
Mr. Hank!
Stay back in the cave, Juanito.
All right. Come on, Juanito.
I told you to stay in the jeep.
What are you doing down here?
- I came to help you.
- To help us.
Oh, come on.
Mr. Hank. Mr. Hank, look.
- What's causing that?
- Dr. Ramos, are you there?
Are you there? Are you there, Dr. Ramos?
Hank, answer me.
- Block the crane, or it'll be pulled in.
- Throw some blocks under that crane.
There goes our cage, gas tanks, everything.
There's no weight on the cable.
Oh, no.
Take the cable, and send it back down as fast as you can.
Bring it in slow.
- Maybe they are on it.
- Oh, pull it up. Please.
Keep bringing it in.
- Keep going, doc.
- Hang on, doc. You can make it.
- Keep going.
- Come on, hold on.
- What happened to Hank?
- Hank and Juanito are down there.
- Get a loop on the cable. Send it, quick.
- Make a loop on the cable.
Oh, Juanito.
Oh, Juanito, why did you do it?
I tried to help them.
It'll be dark in an hour, and those scorpions'll come out again.
- You couldn't use the gas?
- No, we lost it in the molten lava.
There must be 50 of those things down there.
Can't we close and seal that opening with dynamite?
You have no idea as to the size of that place. Wait till you see these pictures.
I want those pictures.
I even hoped to get a specimen.
Why, you couldn't get one of those things out even with this crane.
Major, we must try to seal it shut with an explosion. We must try before nightfall.
I thought you said scorpions could go for months without food.
The giants don't last long. They eat their own weight every three or four days.
But suppose they find another way?
Those passages down there.
This is the only place they have appeared.
This probably is their only exit from the cavern.
- Major.
- Yes, doctor.
Let's close it.
Ready?
Let her go.
I guess that does it.
Midnight, and everyone goes back to what he was before.
This isn't the end of anything, not for us. It's the beginning.
Hank, all of us have done our work now...
...and thank heaven it can be done without any more tragedy.
You have your survey of the volcanoes to make.
Well, that's fine.
I'll be home every night for dinner.
I have to leave at once.
I should have left for the States two months ago to buy cattle for the herd.
- You'll be in Mexico City for a week first?
- Yes.
Then I'll finish up my work here with doc.
I'll meet you there, and you can show me the town.
Oh, but even if we do have, what, a day, two days...?
I don't want to settle for just two days, Hank.
I don't want just two days either.
I don't fool people.
I don't want them to fool me either.
I'm not, darling.
I like you very much indeed.
And I want you very much.
- Dr. Scott.
- Hello, I can hardly hear you.
This is Dr. Velasco.
Oh, Dr. Velasco. How are you, sir?
Well, we're just getting started, finally.
Yeah, right now.
I regret to have to complicate the plans you and Dr. Ramos have made for so long...
...but some of my colleagues here in Mexico are very anxious to talk to you both at once.
I don't really think there's anything we can add to what you already know, Dr. Velasco.
I'm with the director of civilian defense and high army officers right now, Hank.
It is imperative you both return here at once to complete your report.
I don't like to say that you can be ordered.
What's the trouble?
Everything is under control, isn't it?
There's no cause for alarm, not at all.
But a request for cooperation has been made by...
By a good neighbor of the South, and we feel that...
Well, if you put it like that...
Look, we've already postponed the trip five times. I guess once more won't matter.
What? Oh, a plane?
Yeah, sure, that would help a lot.
Oh, Dr. Velasco, do you suppose there'd be room for three on that plane?
Of course there will.
All right, sir. Yes, sir, I understand.
Right, see you then.
- Did he suspect?
- No, I don't think so.
- He assumes that the danger is over.
- That's fine.
You seemed willing to postpone our trip...
...once you learned Teresa could ride on the plane.
Well, at least it was some sort of an inducement.
My friend, remember, this is not the balcony of the neighborhood movie theater.
This is Mexico. When a man shows as much attention to a girl as you have...
...suddenly, he's in a cathedral and wondering how he got there.
So? What have you got against marriage?
I try to remember what my father told me one time.
He said, "Arturo, every child in the world is born single.
Please try to profit more than
I did by the experience."
- Dr. Ramos, Dr. Scott.
- Yes?
I am Victor Esteban. Dr. Velasco has asked me to take you to him at once.
Right away?
But what about Señorita Alvarez?
I have orders to take her wherever she wishes.
But you gentlemen must then accompany me to the university.
All right.
Follow me, please.
Gentlemen, we are grateful that you have given up your own plans to help us.
And we must apologize for bringing you here under false pretenses.
It is not a neighboring country which needs your help. It is our government.
Señor Moreno, of course there's always a possible danger again.
Twenty years from now, another earthquake.
It is not a potential danger, gentlemen.
We feel it is all too real, and not 20 years from now. Perhaps in less than a month.
- You better fill us in from the beginning.
- Yes, of course.
I'm in charge of an aerial mapping project for our government.
Recently our planes were photographing the area near San Lorenzo.
Gentlemen, perhaps if you would sit down and take a look.
Turn off the lights.
No. Not near the city.
It is one of them.
Now you're convinced our fears are justified?
I don't like to disagree...
...but merely because a dead scorpion was found coming to the surface...
...doesn't mean we didn't destroy them all when we dynamited.
This scorpion may be one that...
Excuse me, sir. Naturally, the same thought had occurred to us.
We rechecked our photographs.
On the 21 st, two days after the earthquake, the scorpion was not there.
He was not there until the day after you exploded the dynamite.
And you thought you destroyed the scorpions.
It is obvious at least one survived that explosion...
...and almost succeeded in reaching the surface.
Switch the lights on.
And gentlemen, we must proceed as if there are more of them left.
Exactly where is this area where it was photographed?
Southwest of the volcano.
Almost directly across from the fissure where you and Dr. Scott descended.
You will see, here, is the fissure.
This is San Lorenzo.
It was here, exactly here, that the photograph was taken.
I think you're making a mountain out of a molehill.
Dr. Velasco knows how that mountain went when we blew it up.
Nothing could live under those tons of rock.
- Not if they were under the rocks.
- I don't follow you.
From your description, what Dr. Velasco told us...
...it is obvious that the cavern into which you two men descended...
...is part of Chamilpa Caves...
...huge tunnels that run under the earth at depths up to five miles...
...many of which have been mapped in the region around Mexico City.
Some are flooded, parts of the underground lakes.
Yes, I've heard of them.
Here they are. Notice how this large fissure here...
...is directly above this arm of the system.
This large pocket, here, is exactly the place where you took your photographs.
Now, also note that here...
...where the scorpion was photographed from the air...
...is also part of the connecting system.
The scorpions could have fled underground to one of many underground shelters.
As you thought at the time could happen, Hank.
What is that long arm there?
That is a cavern which extends southward to within 20 miles of Mexico City...
...there, where it lies under the railroad.
This is what we wonder. How many of the scorpions might have decided to rush here?
And when will they decide to come to the surface after blood?
So that is why we brought you here.
The day after tomorrow, we want you to address a group...
...of scientific and military experts so that we may plan for any emergency.
What kind of rifles were you using?
How powerful?
The cartridges I was using are supposed to penetrate two inches of steel.
But they didn't stop the scorpions!
How do they kill each other?
The throat. There's a small spot right here that has no armor. That's its weak point.
When they attack each other, they have poison to inject into their enemy's throat.
- Can you duplicate the poison?
- Nope. Not without a giant scorpion.
What we need is something that'll penetrate that small area exactly...
...and then send some sort of poison into the circulatory systems.
What it could be, I have no idea.
We're all in the same dilemma.
With the meeting on Friday,
I'm sure we'll reach a solution.
Gentlemen, I do not have to tell you that...
...everything we have discussed here is absolutely secret.
This is a city of four million people.
If word of this leaks out...
...the panic of the population would be worse than the scorpions.
Nice dress, nice girl.
Well, thank you.
I'm glad you could see me in something besides the clothes I wear at the ranch...
...for two days at least.
- So am I.
Hank, what's the meeting on Friday about?
Oh, some geophysical conference
Dr. Velasco roped us in on. Cigarette?
Not right now.
After you finish that, where am I taking you for dinner?
Hank, it's only 9:00.
That's what I mean.
Do you realize this is Mexico City?
And no one has dinner before 11:00 at night. Sometimes midnight.
Why, it's practically afternoon right now.
Lots of men are just leaving their offices.
Am I going to have trouble with you.
Well, you work on it, teacher.
I think you can solve me.
Nice work.
Caviar. Aren't you overdoing it a bit, Hank?
Well, I've gotta make an impression on you in 48 hours that'll last for two months.
Don't you like caviar?
Oh, I love it, but I must say I could never understand why it's so expensive.
Well, it's a whole year's work for a sturgeon.
It's been wonderful these past two days. I wish they'd never end.
They don't have to.
For a while, they do.
I wish you'd change your mind.
You don't have to go away.
That volcano can wait.
No, you'll get through with your speech tomorrow and your silly expedition...
...and I'll do everything I have to do.
When we come back we won't have a worry in the world.
We interrupt this program to bring you a news bulletin.
The train from Monterrey was derailed outside of Mexico City.
Early reports indicate an appalling loss of life.
Eyewitness accounts state that monstrous scorpions...
...have swarmed around the wreckage.
One moment, please, we're trying to get through to the emergency area.
Reports to this moment from available hospital and emergency field units...
...indicate many of the victims are so badly injured there is little hope of their survival.
All ambulances, cars, trucks and other vehicles...
...have been commandeered by the authorities in this emergency.
We've received a report from the scene confirming that 129 persons...
...are killed and hundreds missing.
Survivors report...
...a giant black scorpion killed the smaller scorpions and is headed for Mexico City.
We were trying to find you.
- What can we do?
- You can help us soon enough.
We're not sure how many of them are left, but the largest may be the only one.
With the lust for blood after the wreck, the scorpions went mad.
The largest killed four of them, and may have killed the rest of them.
- Where is the scorpion?
- We lost it in the hills 10 miles out of town.
But it's approaching the northwest area of the capital.
Yes. Yes.
It has been seen. Let's go.
Attention. Attention.
The city is under martial law.
All inhabitants living north of Tacubaya and west of Guadalupe must leave their homes.
Follow the orders of the police.
Listen, darling, you get in that building and stay there!
The scorpion has not reached the city.
It has been verified that only one giant black scorpion is alive.
The public is warned that the city will have a blackout.
A defense ring is being set up surrounding the area where it was seen.
Authorities are taking all protective measures. Observe safety precautions.
Protect your homes from fire hazards.
Sections of the community are in a state of panic...
...adding to the burden of the authorities and threatening...
...to disrupt communications vital to the defense of the city.
If rifles and cannon won't stop it...
- Major Cosio here.
- Yes.
We have narrowed the ring one mile along
Insurgentes. Operation is proceeding.
That's fine. Have Major Ortega meet us in front of the stadium with the weapon.
Major Ortega, Major Ortega.
Meet us in front of the stadium with the weapon and generator.
With what kind of weapon?
I hope it is a weapon.
Just now it is only a prayer.
- Dr. Velasco?
- Yes?
Tell Col. Sanchez to move the heavy equipment into the stadium.
Col. Sanchez, Col. Sanchez.
Dr. Velasco here.
Move all the heavy equipment into the stadium right away.
The projectile enters the throat.
If I'm lucky, Dr. Velasco, but I have never used a weapon like this before.
Attached to the projectile is the copper wire...
...then the insulated wire which leads to the cable and the generator.
It should give 600,000 volts.
- This meat should bring him in here.
- I hope so.
It's about the only way we can corner it.
You might need more than one shot, major.
- Señor Moreno.
- Yes, yes.
The scorpion is following the meat wagon.
There it is.
The throat, major. Remember, the white area on the throat.
The head comes back just before it strikes.
Right.
You missed!
I won't miss this time!
Turn it off! Turn it off!
Turn the switch on!
Turn it off!
Now we can secure some of the actual poison from the Scorpionida rex...
...analyze it and create a simple protection against them if ever again...
- Hank, Velasco wants to...
- Gentlemen, we must not waste any time.
If we could all meet tomorrow at my laboratory for a recapitulation.
Hank, Señorita Alvarez!
We have not yet finished.
Neither have we.
[Rip by Talorg]
- Hello, sir.
- Hello, Bob.
LARRY:
It seems okay, Lefty.
It ought to be.
It's the 23rd test with the new fuel.
No overheating?
- Not anymore. That's all, Bob.
- All finished.
- Any misfiring?
- None at all.
Would you say it was perfect now?
I'd never say anything was perfect.
Anyway, we'll know this afternoon.
- Sounds like Mike's plane.
- Yeah.
- Let's go and tell him.
- All right.
[ENGINES STOP]
- Tell Larry to pick me up at the locker room.
- Okay.
ROSS: Will you all please be seated, ladies and gentlemen?
- Good morning, sir.
BLANDFORD: Good morning.
ROSS: Everything's ready now.
BLANDFORD: Wonderful.
We'll answer your questions, providing they don't violate security regulations.
REPORTER 1: I hope that doesn't mean you'll sit in deep official silence.
Not at all. Operation Stardust is a purely scientific venture.
Mr. Blandford, we have heard a lot of rumors about Operation Stardust.
What is the main object of this flight?
We hope to show that man can break away from the Earth's pull.
Get outside the force of gravity.
Oh, then the spaceship will actually...
No, no, the Stardust is not really a spaceship.
We're not at that stage yet.
But you believe the Stardust can get outside the field of gravity?
Yes, she should reach a height of over 1000 miles...
...and a speed of about
5 miles per second.
- For how long?
- Theoretically, forever.
Once the Stardust has passed the upper stratosphere...
...there will be no frictional resistance or gravity to stop it.
Oh, here is Commander Hayden, the chief test pilot.
- Good morning.
REPORTERS: Good morning.
Gentlemen, this is Larry Noble, my chief officer and navigator.
- Morning.
REPORTERS: How do you do?
Take over, commander.
Captain Ross will watch the questions, which are under security.
Commander Hayden, can you tell us exactly what you intend to do today?
At 1500 hours this afternoon...
...l'm going to take a jet fighter up 80,000 feet.
Once up there, I'm going to give the plane all I know.
Is this the test we've been invited to see?
That's right.
The biggest obstacle in these tests has been fuel.
Fuel to boost rocket turbines to the tremendous power output required.
We've already lost two planes and two good men.
You think you've got it?
We hope the lives of two men have not been wasted.
What we've learned gives Hayden a better chance...
...for the plane he takes up.
If it stands up to the tests he will give it...
...then...
- Then?
Operation Stardust will proceed as scheduled.
REPORTER 2:
What is the schedule?
If the test is a failure, we start all over again.
But if it succeeds, the Stardust will take off tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?
- Yes.
Everyone is standing by and the weather is perfect.
We've prepared releases for you.
- Larry, help me.
- Yes, sir.
They contain all the technical details for your story.
REPORTER 2:
Can we use these?
Yes, of course, we put them there for you.
Thank you.
Commander, just what do you hope to accomplish?
This is the first step, the first attempt to get beyond the stratosphere.
Away from the Earth's force.
- And then what?
- Come again.
Supposing you get beyond the stratosphere, what will man have gained?
Well, we'll know a little more.
Be less ignorant about the universe and our place in it.
Don't you think first we ought to find out what's wrong with our own world?
Why give the whole universe the benefit of our ignorance?
REPORTER 2:
Commander Hayden?
This spacecraft, Stardust, what potential does it have in time of war?
I'm afraid, gentlemen, that question is out of order.
Commander, how will the human body react to the acceleration...
...needed to reach the speed of 5 miles per second?
Eighteen thousand miles per hour.
It sounds like a lot, but the acceleration should be fairly gradual.
If you want figures, it should be about
128 feet per second per second.
What's that in simple language, commander?
In simple language, that's 6 miles up in 24 seconds.
Ladies and gentlemen, if you'd like to see the rest of the building...
You've got it all down pat anyhow.
I have a feeling you don't approve of this project.
Is that so strange when the whole thing is completely unnecessary? In fact, suicidal.
You said you'd already lost two men.
They were aware of the danger and thought it worthwhile.
What if the Stardust blows up, as she probably will?
Then we'll know... The designers will know that the fuel or the design was imperfect.
Some people find it impossible to be quite so impersonal, commander.
If I may be personal,
I'm glad I'm not your wife.
And if I may be personal, so am I.
Control testing. Control testing.
One, two, three...
...four, five, six...
Here's your microphone.
The lead's long enough.
You'll get an excellent view from here.
- Have we got contact with the hangar?
- Yes, sir.
REPORTER: When's it start?
- Takeoff in two minutes.
BLANDFORD: Blandford to Skytest.
Are you receiving me? Over.
And, please, no more photographs.
MAN [O VER RADIO]: Skytest to Blandford,
receiving loud and clear.
- Can we mention the name of this place?
- Yes.
BLANDFORD:
Thank you. Switching off.
- Who is that girl?
- Kim Hamilton.
Special correspondent of the World Press Service.
I should've said something to Hayden.
- She represents the opposition.
- Opposition?
Public opinion is divided. Most people think it's a great experiment.
But there is the other point of view that Hayden is committing suicide.
The suicide idea would be enough to stir up plenty of opposition.
- It's nonsense.
- Is it? Simms?
- You think...?
- It's not a question of what I think.
- You and I know the more important story.
- The bomb.
Even without knowing about that, you can't blame people for feeling opposition.
Dr. Blandford, message from Control, sir.
- Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen.
ROSS: May we have your attention, please?
BLANDFORD:
Hayden will be taking off in 30 seconds.
I've had radio equipment installed...
...so you can hear Hayden's firsthand impressions...
...while he's in the air.
[ENGINES WHIRRING]
MICHAEL:
Skytest to Control. Skytest to Control.
- Skytest to Control. Over.
OPERATOR: You're on. Over.
Hello, Mike. This is Blandford.
How is it? Over.
MICHAEL:
Everything's fine. Responding well.
I'm now cruising at 9000 feet.
Airfield looming up.
Airfield gone. Over.
You're on your own, Mike.
Commence test when ready. Over.
Pulling her up to vertical climb. Over.
BLANDFORD:
He's taking her up to 80,000 feet.
- And then what?
- He'll bring her down again.
- In one piece?
- Skytest to Blandford. Over.
- Sorry.
- Go ahead, Mike. Over.
I'm leveling out.
Coming down at maximum velocity now. Over.
Pull her out, Mike, pull her out!
- He's left it too late.
- He's overshot.
[ENGINES RO ARING]
[ENGINES STOP]
Blandford to Skytest.
Blandford to Skytest.
Mike, for heaven's sake, answer.
That was the sound barrier.
And right now I'm about 80 miles away,
so you wouldn't hear me.
I'm riding along the rim of the coast.
Everything responding. Everything okay.
Quite a joy ride. Over.
How about fuel pressure? Over.
Everything normal.
Now returning to airfield. Over.
Well, ladies and gentlemen, we have what we wanted, a successful test.
- He's finished? It's over?
- Not quite, Miss Hamilton. Not quite.
- We have to go through that again?
- Receiving loud and clear, Miss Hamilton.
It's nice to have you worry about me. Just
a few routine aerobatics before I come in.
Very pretty to watch.
And who knows, I might even
provide you with a suicide. Over.
Nice work, Mike.
Thank you, Simms.
Ladies and gentlemen,
Operation Stardust will go ahead tomorrow.
I still bet we don't take off tomorrow.
There's nothing to stop us, is there?
I'm getting to a state
I don't believe anything anymore.
Well, everything's set.
- What time?
- Start warming up at 0915 hours.
- Take off 1000 hours.
- All right, I lose my bet.
I suggest you both take it easy.
Try and get some sleep. You'll need it.
Dinner at home for me.
Anything else, Mike?
No. Don't keep that dinner waiting.
Barbara's gonna be thrilled it's happening.
- Good night, sir.
- Good night, Larry.
There's a great deal to be done.
Where will you be if I want to speak?
I'll be around. I could do with a drink.
- I wonder if the press left any free stuff.
- Why not go and find out?
By the way, you might let Ross know exactly where you are.
Yes, of course.
KIM:
Okay, I'm finished.
All right.
- Will you have those photographs ready?
- Yeah, as soon as I get back to the office.
Good.
Oh, Bill.
Put this on the editor's desk for me.
You'll be in later?
You really do believe in all this, don't you, commander?
You don't spend five years of your life on this if it means nothing to you.
Someday men are going to explore the universe.
- And when they do finally...
- But that's just it. Do what?
What are you gonna find that's worth so much?
Perhaps a new world.
The better world they're talking about.
Anyway, it's important to find out.
I know that some people can't understand.
- You don't see it either, do you?
- Well, I can't say I agree with you.
- All the same, will you do me a favor?
- I don't know. It depends what it is.
Let me see the Stardust.
Why?
So you can write a sarcastic story about something you don't understand.
"I saw the Stardust last night...
...the plane that's being launched into nowhere for no reason.
And what is it? Just a mass of metal.
Plain, ordinary metal."
- That's what you want to write.
- It has nothing to do with what I write.
I have a very special reason for wanting to see it.
If you use this to ridicule the project,
I promise to come back...
...just to pay you back.
I only wanna look at it. Can we go, then?
All right. Let's use this door.
MICHAEL:
Jimmy, have you checked your equipment?
Yeah, everything's checked and stored.
Oh, this is Jimmy Wheeler.
He's our telescreen operator and photographer.
- Miss Hamilton.
- How do you do?
- Quite a tie you got, Jimmy.
- Yeah.
Pretty smart, eh? There's nothing like a new tie to give a guy courage.
- Especially when he's got a problem.
- Problem? Like which girl to take out?
I'm a one-girl man now.
I'm shooting the works.
- Oh, it's that serious?
- It sure is.
- Say, Lefty?
- Yep.
- Can you keep a secret?
- Oh, I think so.
Look, if you were a girl, a really beautiful girl, would you marry me?
If this is a proposal, Jimmy, save it for the girl.
- Best of luck anyway.
- Thanks. I'll need it.
- I don't think I'm...
- You're not worthy of her.
If I didn't know you better,
I'd say you were kidding me.
Look, Lefty. Why don't you come up to London with me?
Maybe Ellen's got a girlfriend.
We can have a ball.
You know, if this crew's ever gonna have a night out, this is it.
I don't think so.
No, I didn't think so either.
I don't see you celebrating anything.
No offense. Be seeing you.
MICHAEL: Good evening, Thomas.
THOMAS: Good evening, sir.
KIM: Good evening.
THOMAS: Good evening, miss.
KIM: Tell me, Mr. Thomas, do you wanna go up tomorrow?
Me, miss? No. I'm comfortable down here on the ground.
Practically retired. At least Thomas has his age as an excuse.
I remember when a bike was the fastest thing.
See what I mean? Come on. Let's go.
THOMAS:
Let me, sir.
I've never seen anything so overpowering, so beautiful.
MICHAEL:
It's beautiful, all right. Even down here.
KIM:
Yes, it's beautiful but evil.
MICHAEL: Why evil? Oh, I admit that power can be used for evil purposes...
...but there's nothing evil in this.
We're just doing something that's never been done before.
KIM: You mean because it's never needed to be done.
Is there any point in trying something just because it's never been done?
Your trouble is that you want to stand still, and the world can't and doesn't.
I'd like to go now.
THOMAS: Good night.
KIM: Good night.
MICHAEL: Good night, Thomas.
THOMAS: Good night, sir.
It's a wonder you don't have more guards.
There are plenty of guards, but they watch the outer areas.
What do these guards do?
There are no gunfights, if that's what you mean...
...but they stop a few souvenir-hunters and fanatics...
...who want to blow up the Stardust.
Like you, for example.
- Do you hate me for feeling like this?
- I don't hate you at all.
There'll always be people against progress and you have every right to be one of them.
- I'll turn the jeep around.
- And you're a stubborn idealist.
It's what you're doing I dislike, not you.
Is there any difference between what a man does and what he is?
I knew two other men like you.
They're both dead because of what you call progress.
[WHISTLING]
Barbara?
Barbara? Oh, hello, dear.
I got away as quickly as I could.
I was afraid something might come up.
And having nothing better to do, you came home.
Barbara, you know tomorrow's the big day.
- Another big day?
- Do try and understand, dear.
I thought we paid this bill.
All I can understand is that
I've had five years of waiting...
...for one big day or another, after which everything will be wonderful.
- But this one really is...
- I know, this one is going to be different.
- Well, don't let's quarrel.
- You won't have a chance.
I'm going to Myra's party.
- Will it be all right if I come along too?
- You can if you want to.
- I'd hoped that we could be alone tonight.
- You did?
You suddenly remembered you had a wife.
Don't let's bicker all the time.
- I'm sorry I've been a bit busy lately.
- "A bit busy"?
Well, that's a laugh.
Even when you're with me, you're not really with me at all.
You're thinking about some problem on that rocket of yours.
You knew my job when you married me.
You knew it then, the sort of life we'd lead together.
I didn't really expect anything like this.
And besides, you've changed.
You don't really need me anymore.
Oh, Barbara, I do need you.
Anyway, this job's nearly finished.
I promise after tomorrow we can have all the time we want.
And you're sure that after tomorrow there won't be bigger and better rockets?
Barbara.
That wasn't fair.
I thought it was pretty good.
[CAR ENGINE STARTS]
[VEHICLE DRIVES AWAY]
[FOOTSTEPS]
- Must be about time for our relief.
- Yes.
- Larry, will you promise me one thing?
- Certainly.
Tonight let's forget about everything except us.
That'll be easy. I promise.
[PHONE RINGING]
Mr. And Mrs. Noble are out.
- Well, perhaps...
- Oh, Larry, please don't answer it.
Larry.
Hello?
Oh, yes, sir.
Tonight? No, I can't.
Won't it keep till the morning?
Oh, I see.
Yes, I'll be right over.
[PHONE HANGS UP]
- That was the chief.
- I heard.
Well, it's important.
Of course.
The rocket is always important.
They wouldn't call me if they didn't need me.
And they can have you.
But this time, I'm not waiting for the rocket to let you come back.
[DOOR CLOSES]
- Oh, hello, Michael. Come in.
- Hello.
Did they find Miss Hamilton?
No, sir. I imagine she left without handing in her pass.
- I don't know how.
- I wouldn't worry about it, sir.
Blandford, let's get down to the task in hand.
We should wait until Mr. Noble gets here. He's on his way now.
I thought the crew would have been sleeping here.
If I had my way, the whole project would have been handled as a top-secret.
That would have drawn more attention to it. We wanted to avoid that.
May I introduce Commander Hayden, the chief pilot?
- How do you do?
- Professor Merrity, War Office.
Glad to meet you, professor.
All this sounds very mysterious, sir.
[KNOCKS ON DOOR]
- Come in.
- I didn't know that the War Office...
...were interested.
- Professor, this is Mr. Noble.
Good evening.
Hello, Mike, it's a bit late.
- Sorry.
- Let's get to the point, shall we?
All this is in absolute confidence.
Blandford, will you tell them?
Michael, we all know the scientific object of your flight tomorrow...
...and the observations you're going to take...
...but there is another project even more important.
When you take off, you'll be carrying a bomb.
- A bomb?
- Not an ordinary one.
The first Tritonium bomb to be made, T-1.
It was perfected at the atomic research station in New Mexico.
Look, wait a minute.
I thought we were on a purely scientific mission.
Michael, it took many millions to finance and build Stardust.
That money would never have been made available for research alone.
Blandford, let's stop beating about the bush.
Your ship was built to take T-1 up beyond the stratosphere.
Why can't the new jet bombers take it up? What's the point?
T-1 is a new type of atomic weapon...
...far more powerful than the hydrogen bomb.
- More powerful than the H-bomb?
- Yes.
That's why it cannot be tested on Earth.
Up there beyond the atmosphere, the explosion will exhaust itself in space.
On Earth it would cause destruction beyond anything that you can imagine.
That's why it cannot be exploded on Earth.
Let's hope it's the only Tritonium bomb ever to be exploded.
The test will be recorded and its effects observed all over the globe.
When the destructive power of T-1 is made evident in this way...
...it should be a convincing demonstration of the futility of any future war.
If I say that the bomb should never have been made...
...l'd only be trying to turn back the clock.
The bomb exists now.
- How do I explode it?
- I shall do that.
It'll be released automatically up there...
...to explode at 2100 hours tomorrow.
What happens to the bomb if Stardust crashes on takeoff?
The bomb has a specially designed fuse.
It can't explode until the fuse is set.
Merrity will set the fuse when you reach the required altitude.
Until then, the bomb is harmless.
The reporters are going to be here tomorrow.
How do we explain Professor Merrity?
Officially, he will be described as a meteorological expert.
- You carry on, Ross.
- Right, sir.
- Good night, gentlemen.
ALL: Good night.
I'm afraid I must ask you and Mr. Noble to stay here tonight.
- The War Office insists.
- But I promised my wife...
- I'm sorry.
- It won't take me more than a few minutes.
I'll phone her and tell her I won't be home.
Of course. I hope you don't mind, but I must ask you...
...to telephone her in my presence.
All right.
It's a shock to find that what we thought was the purpose of this project...
...is just a blind for something else.
Have the rest of my crew been told?
No, and they won't be.
We in this room are the only people who know.
Is that fair? You're making
Jimmy and Lefty take part...
...in something they know nothing about.
No chance to back out.
LARRY:
Yes, Birchley, 2592.
- Why should they back out?
- I'm not saying they will.
- They should know what they're doing.
- Sorry. It's impossible.
- Anyway, they both still have the same job.
- Still l...
Are you sure you're ringing the right number?
[RINGING]
- Darling, can you lend me some stockings?
- Yes, in just a moment.
[DOORBELL BUZZES]
Okay, I'll get it.
JIMMY: Hi, Pat.
- Hello, Jimmy.
ELLEN: Who is it?
- It's me, honey.
You set for soft lights and sweet music?
Well, I was.
Jimmy, I'm terribly sorry, but I'm...
What do you mean?
Don't we have a date?
You're not the sort of girl to run out.
- No, but Pat and l...
- It's the fashion show at the Grand Hotel.
- You said you'd got out of that.
- I thought I had.
- Stockings.
- Oh, yes.
My boss just called.
One of the girls is ill.
You can call your boss back and tell her you have an important date.
No, I can't.
Supposing you'd been told to stay at
Thunder Hill tonight. You'd have stayed.
I've got a job too.
I've got to do what I'm told.
- Great, tonight of all nights.
- It's how things happen.
- They're coming for me. I must be ready.
- Sure, I get chucked out, just like that.
There'll be other nights.
Not for me, honey.
- Jimmy?
JIMMY: I'm sorry, honey.
[MAN SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY]
[PIANO PLAYING]
BARBARA: He was going to take me to the south of France, but we didn't go.
You mean he neglects you?
- Perhaps he doesn't mean to, but...
- He does, doesn't he?
His work always seems to be much more important to him than I am.
Well, it's hard to understand when a man has a wife as lovely as you.
Excuse me a moment.
- Got a light, Jerry?
- Sure.
- How's Larry?
- He's fine. Thank you.
Barbara, let's put these away.
And then, if you feel like it...
...let's go somewhere and dance.
Well, yes, I'd love to.
Same again, Jack.
You can't drown it, you know.
- No?
- No.
- Make it a double.
- A woman?
Yeah. Yeah, she stood me up.
For another man?
No, a fashion show.
I ask you, a fashion show.
- She's just like all the others, I suppose.
- What do you mean, "like all the others"?
- Listening to you talking, I thought...
- Well, don't.
Maybe you're giving up too easily.
- How much do I owe you, Jack?
- That's the one.
I shouldn't have thought a fashion show would give you any competition.
- Do you have a telephone here?
- Yes, over there.
- Well, give me some change, will you?
- Here you are.
[SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
Tell Mr. Miller we'll be up in a few seconds.
Ellen? Oh, Ellen, someone wants to talk to you on the telephone.
He was very insistent.
You can take it outside.
Hurry up, you're on in a few seconds.
Thank you.
- Hello?
JIMMY: Hello, Ellen?
Oh, Jimmy, I'm so happy.
I mean, I'm so sorry.
The show will be going on for hours and hours.
Yeah, listen, Ellen. I brought you a present but I forgot to give it to you.
- Oh?
- In fact, it's a ring.
A ring?
Can't you see it? It's a very pretty ring.
Imagine you're standing with me.
I'm taking your hand and saying:
- "Ellen, will you marry me?"
- Darling.
- Well, I can't go on till you say "yes."
- I'm saying "yes" right now.
- You... You are? You mean you really are?
- Yes.
Well, that... That's wonderful.
Look, I'm putting it on your finger.
See it?
Of course I can see it, Jimmy.
It's beautiful.
- It's the loveliest ring in the world.
- Ellen, please.
Bye, Jimmy.
Well, you're home.
I'm glad you took me out tonight.
This is the first time
I've really enjoyed myself for ages.
I've enjoyed it too.
Barbara, can I call you tomorrow?
All right, Tony.
Good night.
- And thanks again.
- Good night.
There it is, George.
Everything the well-dressed man needs for a stroll above the stratosphere.
- Including its own jet propulsion.
- Pretty smart.
Well, pal, I hope they never have to use you.
All right, stand clear, you guys.
I'm gonna bring her up.
GALLOWAY:
Careful now, guys, how you stow this.
- Be sure you check all the shackles.
- Okay.
- Get off the ship as soon as you're finished.
- Yes, sir.
It's heavy.
I wonder what it's supposed to do.
Put the photisms in the gammas and the flow, I think.
Size tech the photisms in the gammas and the flow with fine goggles.
Very funny.
Well, Michael, it's two minutes past 9.
After completing your scheduled flight...
...you will release the T-1 at the position and height marked on this chart.
Pilot rockets are attached to the bomb to propel it...
...beyond the magnetic field of the ship.
The bomb's orbit has been worked out...
...so instruments all over the world will be trained on the exact spot of the explosion.
- Anything else?
- I think that covers it, sir.
Let's go. I want to see that the T-1 is secured.
Don't worry, professor, it will be.
What about your special fuse?
It's due here under armed guard at 9:15.
- Goodbye, Blandford.
- Goodbye, professor.
Well, Michael, good luck.
We'll try to see that everything goes according to plan, sir.
MERRITY: Bye.
ROSS: Goodbye, professor.
Heroes face death with a smile on their lips.
What's the fare, Mac? Cheer up.
- You're all heroes.
- I never felt less like a hero.
The air smells good.
Where we're going, they don't have any.
JIMMY: What are you beefing about?
- What are you happy about?
I'll let you in. Last night, I got engaged to the most wonderful girl in the world.
I don't wanna spoil your illusions, but you'll be surprised...
...how soon the most wonderful girl turns into the old woman.
How about last night?
Did you paint the town red?
I didn't go anywhere last night.
I was here. By order. Hello, Mike.
MICHAEL:
Larry, better get aboard. It's nearly 9:15.
MERRITY:
I must wait for the delivery of this...
MICHAEL: It takes 45 minutes for the turbos to warm up. There's plenty of time.
By the way, this is Professor Merrity.
He's coming as meteorologist.
- How do you do?
- Good morning.
This is Blake. We call him Lefty.
He's our turbo-jet engineer.
This is Jimmy Wheeler.
He looks after our telex apparatus.
I'd better get back to the control tower.
Your box of tricks will be here any minute.
It's probably been delayed by the crowds.
That looks like it, sir.
A five-eighth, Jim.
Commander, the extra acceleration couch. We had to move it up.
That's okay. Have you tested the compression yet?
- We're doing it now, sir.
- Right.
All okay, Lefty?
Stand by.
Main circuit in.
Fire all jets at minimum charge.
[JETS THRUSTING]
Jim, get ahold of this.
MAN:
Special delivery for Professor Merrity.
MERRITY: That's me. Be careful of that fuse box. It contains acid.
MAN: I can take it for you, sir.
MERRITY: No. I'll take it myself.
MAN:
Okay.
Let's go.
We're all finished now.
Stay clear of the jets as you go.
They're radioactive.
- Good luck.
- Thank you.
Okay.
Do we need these masks?
- No, professor, the cabin is pressurized.
- Thanks.
Stardust to Control. Stardust to Control.
Do you receive me? Over.
Thunder Hill to Stardust.
Receiving you clearly.
Switch on your telex radar.
Switched on.
Okay, Stardust, your telex is being received.
Don't forget to alter your frequency at 90,000 feet and again at 32 miles.
I'm the telex operator.
T for Tommy, E, Edward...
...L, London, E, Edward, X.
I know my job.
Only thing worrying me, do you?
Thunder Hill to Stardust.
No cracks, please.
A lot of important people are hearing you.
Say, that's great.
Maybe this is my big chance.
Do I get to sing now?
[MEN LAUGHING]
[SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
COMMENTATOR: A takeoff of the first piloted rocket ship in history.
There must be thousands of people here...
...who have come from all over to see this great event.
At 10:00, in just over nine minutes...
...the rocket jets will slowly increase their power...
...until the ship is projected from its underground hangar.
No more inside.
You'll have to watch from here.
Don't push. The whole thing will be perfectly clear for miles from here.
ELLEN: You must let me in.
It's terribly important.
I'm sorry, there's too many inside already. Send that car back.
- But there's somebody I must see.
- Who?
Jimmy Wheeler. He's one of the crew on the rocket.
- Please let me see him.
- I'm sorry, miss, it's too late.
Thirty seconds to go.
- Twenty seconds, Mike.
- Okay.
Try and relax as we take off.
Just sink into the seat.
- It shouldn't be uncomfortable.
- Fifteen.
Stand by.
Ten, nine, eight, seven...
...six, five, four, three, two...
- Cut in fuel.
There she goes. She's gathering speed up the launching ramp.
[ROCKET PASSES O VERHEAD]
Larry, course okay?
Dead on.
Here we go.
[JETS ACCELERATING]
This bomb is gonna be exploded
1000 miles above the Earth?
Yes, at 9 p.m. Greenwich Mean Time tonight. Her Majesty's government...
...and the United States have advised every country in the world about this.
REPORTER:
What is the purpose of this experiment?
Is it a demonstration of force, a threat?
No, gentlemen. It is a scientific demonstration of destructive power.
After this explosion, the futility of war...
...should be even more apparent than it is at present.
[PANTING]
Get ready to cut six jets, Lefty.
Set, skipper.
I can't stand this much longer.
- Quiet, please, professor.
- But l...
Shut up.
Cut to Jets 1 and 8.
[JETS DECELERATING]
You've no right to talk like that.
- Sorry, I'm in charge. Here.
- You'll discover when we get back...
If you don't stop gabbering when I work out force and velocity corrections...
...we won't get back.
- Is it all right to move?
Yes, you can do what you like now, professor.
We lost two points to starboard on takeoff.
We cut the motors a little early.
- Get the figures as soon as you can.
- Okay.
I've established contact with Thunder Hill. Message?
- Not yet.
- Mike.
Who is this guy Merrity?
I think I'll go and have a look at the gyros.
Yeah, who is he anyway, Mike?
I'm sorry, I wasn't allowed to tell you until now.
But the main object of this flight is to release a new bomb known as T-1.
Purely as a demonstration, and Merrity is here to do it.
- You mean the bomb's aboard the ship?
- That's right.
- I'm glad I didn't know that.
- The bomb is harmless until the fuse is set...
...otherwise they'd never let those crowds watch.
They might have told us...
If you'd been told, you'd have had to stay at Thunder Hill last night.
Ah, well, in that case... Eh, Lefty?
Well, where is she?
She said she'd be here.
- Like I told you, she didn't show.
- Now we got no story on the takeoff.
- We got the pictures...
- Get Mac.
- Where are you going with those?
- Sorry.
And so we carry on according to plan with this one additional job.
MERRITY: Commander Hayden.
- What's the matter?
Are you aware we have another passenger onboard?
Larry, take over.
This is more like a bus service than a spaceship.
Yeah, you can say that again.
I might have known it'd be you.
You're lucky to be alive.
You know this woman?
This is Kim Hamilton.
She doesn't approve of what we're doing...
...but opinions don't matter when it's a question of getting a story.
This is an outrage.
I'm surprised you take it calmly.
No point in doing anything else.
I can't drop her outside, much as I'd like to.
- You take it very sensibly.
- Sensibly?
I'd like to point out that this crazy adventure...
...might have killed us all.
- What do you mean?
We might have precise limits in the weight the ship could lift.
Any additional weight, we might never have got clear of gravity.
- I didn't think of that.
- Of course not.
You storybook heroines never think of things like that.
You only think of how clever you're being and impose on others to save your necks.
- You need any help?
- Get a message away.
- Kim Hamilton aboard.
- Okay.
Make it clear she has no right to be here.
- Tell them she stowed away.
- Sure. I'll see it gets through.
Make sure you cover yourself, whatever you do.
They should be in their orbit very soon now.
What's the matter?
I'm just thinking.
You know what we've started?
The first step into space. Now that we've taken it, we'll have to keep going.
- Would you want to stop?
- Of course not.
Yet as that Hamilton has been saying,
"Here we are, dashing out into space..."
[KNOCKS ON DOOR]
Come in. "...before we've thought about the problems we might meet."
Dr. Blandford, from the Stardust, sir.
Thank you.
- Good heavens.
- What's the matter?
Read it.
"Stardust to Control.
Maneuvering into free orbit. Stop.
Kim Hamilton stowaway."
How are we gonna explain this to Security?
I better get on them right away.
I'd better go and see if I can get a message to Hayden.
- Security. But what can you tell him?
- That's right. What can I tell him?
Ross. The chief of security's gonna chew my ears off over this.
But I can't help admiring that girl.
Yes, put me through, will you?
- How do we stand?
- According to the instruments, we're there.
If you cut the power now, we'll just float in space forever.
- Would you like to try it?
- We need power to maintain gravity.
- Lefty.
- Yes, skipper?
Set two jets firing at minimum.
I'd rather like to have tried free fall.
Remember to alternate every five minutes.
KIM:
Coffee, gentlemen?
You have enough provisions to last a week.
Weight doesn't seem to be of vital importance after all.
I said it might have been.
Professor, we're in our orbit now.
I'm on a ship that is, not that might have been.
You take this matter lightly.
What you've done is little short of criminal.
I don't know under what breach of regulation you'll be charged.
- Coffee, professor?
- But you will be.
You attractive women think you've nothing to do...
...but wave your hips and everything's forgiven.
- Commander, coffee?
- Thank you.
I'm glad you think I'm attractive, but I assure you I wasn't waving my hips.
- Mr. Noble?
- Thank you.
- Lefty?
LEFTY: Thanks.
You haven't asked me yet why I came along.
I'm not the least bit interested in why you came.
Another slap in the face.
I'm getting used to them.
I get the impression you're not welcome around here.
- Are we still in contact with Thunder Hill?
- No. I think our last message got through.
Well, I certainly hope so.
Then they'll know that I'm on the job.
EDITOR: Well?
- Sorry, no news.
She didn't even get home.
There's no sign of her at Thunder Hill.
When I let her cover this story...
...I must have been crazy.
- Courier.
Women, they've no nose for news, no sense of responsibility.
I don't like them. In fact, I hate them.
Oh, brother. I love them.
- Where are they going?
- To release the bomb, I guess.
What bomb?
You don't know much about that, do you?
It's some new atomic bomb called the T-1...
...and setting it off was what we really came up here for.
So it wasn't a scientific project, after all.
It's a scientific project. It's just that the money was put up for the other thing.
You should have stayed. The newspapers were given the whole story.
What did you think about it when they told you about the bomb?
Well, I guess I didn't think much at all.
What about you, Lefty?
Well, I'm an engineer.
But if it's got to be exploded, this is the place to do it.
MERRITY: The explosion will be felt over the world in a series of shock waves.
What damage will that cause?
It might cause strong wind, gales in certain areas.
The density of the air will break up the tremors before they reach the Earth.
Commander, it's 11:10.
The bomb, once primed, must be released immediately.
- Start priming it.
- I need assistance.
I can't do it by myself. Noble, help me.
- That's all right.
- Release the shackles...
...and remove the fuse plate.
- Right.
Signal to me you'll cut the jets.
You, Noble, will fire the pilot rockets.
They will propel the bomb away from the magnetic attraction of the ship.
- How long will it take?
- About two minutes.
I'll leave you to it.
So that's the bomb.
It's a pity so much time, money and intelligence...
...is wasted on making bigger and better bombs.
- For once I agree with you.
- Well, that's a pleasant surprise.
We're beginning to understand each other.
Maybe.
Hold it, mate.
Screw the plate on.
We used to think of the first space travelers...
...landing on planets and planting flags.
Now I suppose the first thing they do is explode an atomic bomb.
Exploding the bomb is not my job.
It's nothing to do with me.
Weren't you consulted?
Blandford was. Larry and I were only told about it last night.
Government officials give orders without understanding what they mean.
I don't think that applies. The project must have been carefully planned.
Supposing the explosion doesn't dissipate itself in space...
...this could be the end of the world.
Then that gives you something more to worry about.
Is that properly screwed down?
You do know how to fire the pilot rockets?
I know what I'm doing.
- Release it as soon as the jets are cut.
- Right.
Anyway, what can one do?
I'm told to release a bomb.
If I refuse, someone else takes the Stardust up, that's all.
I wish there'd never been a Stardust.
There had to be one.
If not now, in 10 years or 20.
It was only a matter of time. All set?
- Yes, all ready.
- Lefty.
Wait. Are you quite sure this bomb has to be exploded?
- It's too late now.
- It isn't. In a few seconds it will be.
Don't get hysterical, now of all times.
We know our business, you quite definitely do not.
- Control yourself, please.
- Stand by to shut off the jets.
Are you prepared to take responsibility for anything that might happen?
How can I take responsibility for everything that might happen? Commander.
As a scientist, how can you go on with it?
Okay, Lefty. Shut off the jets.
[JETS STOP]
Excellent.
Eleven twenty-one exactly.
I'm glad that's over.
It was a nerve-racking job.
Understand that things are not done without due consideration.
- I should hope not.
- Everything is taken into account.
Every phase is timed and checked in advance.
I wasn't worried about the timing.
What was worrying you?
The effect of the explosion?
That's been carefully calculated too.
Five hundred years ago it was carefully calculated the Earth was flat.
A ship sailing to the edge would go over.
You can't tell. You can't be sure of what will happen under new conditions.
- You can only guess.
- You lack scientific training.
- It's a waste of time talking to you.
- Professor.
Have a look at this.
The rockets have failed.
You blundering idiot!
They were ignited when the bomb left the ship.
Something has gone wrong.
If the rockets have failed, maybe the fuse failed too.
- That bomb can go off.
- Get the ship under way.
- Lf we're within hundreds of miles...
- Won't the jets detonate the bomb?
- Get clear of it.
- Stand by to blast ahead.
Wait. The ejection-bay doors are still open.
- Do you wanna wait till the bomb explodes?
- You don't have to be shouting.
Larry. Get back as soon as you can.
Don't wait. I'll hang on down here.
You'll need the extra chair.
- Larry.
- Watch for the signal.
All I want to know, is it safe to fire the outer jets?
In theory, yes.
Heat shouldn't detonate the T-1.
We must get clear. Fire the outer jets.
Get in your seats.
Miss Hamilton, take that seat there.
Lefty, try 10 seconds full dive,
Jets 1 and 8.
Same jets, minimum charge.
Right.
Cut.
[JETS DECELERATING]
What happened?
Are we clear of it, professor?
It's still there. It never moved.
I'm not surprised.
What do you mean?
I didn't think we would get clear of it.
Skipper, I don't understand.
Maybe you'd like to tell them, professor?
Then I will.
Up here, there is no gravity, no air resistance, nothing.
We could stay suspended in space forever...
...and that goes for anything outside the ship too.
Why does the bomb stick when we accelerate?
With no gravity or air resistance, the magnetic attraction...
...of two metal objects is enough to keep them together.
When we accelerate, we drag the bomb with us.
The magnetic attraction of the ship's too small.
It's a fact. Even Professor Merrity's colleagues recognized it.
That's why they gave the bomb its own propulsion.
Now that that's failed, we can blast as much as we like.
The bomb will still come with us.
Looks as if I had good reason to be concerned.
The way things turned out, you did.
- Commander, can't you think of something?
- It's not going to be that easy.
MERRITY: Well, don't just stand there and say it's not going to be easy.
Professor, if there's a way, we'll find it.
Contact Thunder Hill. They may be able to come up with some suggestion.
- What's the time, Lefty?
- Eleven forty-two.
That means we've still got more than nine hours. Come with me, Larry.
[PHONE RINGING]
[JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO]
Hello?
Oh, hello, Tony. I'm so glad you called.
Why, yes, I had a wonderful evening.
- I'd love a drink.
MAN [ON RADIO]:We interrupt this program...
- ... for news of the Stardust.
- What did you say?
- A bulletin announces that the bomb...
- Hold on a minute.
... due to be exploded
at 9 p.m. Tonight has been released.
The bomb, however, has become
attached to the rear of the rocket ship...
... and there appears to be
some difficulty in dislodging it.
REPORTER:
Doctor, all we want are a few facts.
Please, I'm not holding anything back.
- I don't know any more than you.
- Can't you give a simple explanation?
- Why does the bomb stick to the ship?
- Above the atmosphere...
...the magnetic attraction of a larger body from a smaller one...
...is greater than upon Earth.
But you must have known about this before the Stardust took off.
The bomb was fitted with its own propulsion unit to take it clear.
Something has gone wrong and the bomb cannot be cleared.
- May I quote you on this?
- Yes.
Now, please, gentlemen, you must excuse us. I'm sorry.
But can't you give us any more on this?
- Airlock's ready, skipper.
- Okay, Lefty.
There's only one thing to be done.
You must get us down.
Once we land, we can get away in time.
We might. What about everyone else in the area where we land?
The desert. We can land in the Sahara desert.
Radio them to have a plane ready.
No. You've been too convincing about the effect of this explosion.
Is there any way to render the bomb harmless?
Up here? Lmpossible. It's a waste of time going out there. We must land.
You seem to have forgotten something.
Once we get close to Earth's atmosphere...
...the bomb will be affected by gravity and drop to the Earth.
I'm going out to see what went wrong.
The helmet.
- He doesn't realize what's gonna happen.
- I think he does. We all do.
We go down, the bomb goes with us. That means the destruction of millions of people.
You fools. Don't you realize the bomb's going off at 9:00?
- Yes, we do. You've told us often enough.
- Lefty, go up and cut the jets.
You'll be too close to those stone tubes.
We don't know about the radiation.
- The suit will protect me.
- I hope so.
[CONSOLE BEEPING]
[BEEPING STOPS]
MERRITY: What's he doing?
KIM: He's pushing the bomb. It's moving.
Yes, it's moving. It's right behind us.
We can still get away. Start the jets.
- And leave the skipper out there?
- It's no good, look.
He can't do it.
He can't do it.
BARNETT:
So far we've had nothing but talk. Just talk.
The point is that the rocket ship must not come down with the bomb.
BLANDFORD: But we mustn't forget there are human beings up there.
BARNETT: We know that, but there are only six of them.
If they bring that bomb down, heaven knows how many will be killed.
MAN 1: It's impossible to calculate where the bomb will land. It might be anywhere.
ROSS:
Colonel, what's your opinion?
GALLOWAY: Gentlemen, I've been connected with the T-1 project for over three years.
To me it's the most important thing in the world.
But at this moment, I'm more concerned about those people up there.
BARNETT: If this bomb remains attached to the rocket...
...is there no way it can be made harmless?
GALLOWAY: It's almost impossible.
The primer operates by a process of corrosion.
Even if the detonator were removed, the process would continue...
...and would result in the explosion as planned.
MAN 2: Doesn't Merrity know this? Is there a chance he may remove the primer?
GALLOWAY: I can't say. I'd try it myself, but instead of stopping the process...
...it's possible that removing the detonator might explode the bomb sooner.
BARNETT: It looks as if the bomb must be exploded above the stratosphere.
Has anybody any ideas?
Professor Bechstein.
I'm an astronomer, not an expert in explosives.
All I can say is that the relatively small mass of the bomb...
...will keep on being attracted to the rocket's greater mass...
...unless something larger than the rocket takes its place.
GALLOWAY:
Do you think a meteor could do it?
Possibly. But the chances of a large meteor passing close enough to achieve that effect...
...are no greater than finding a particular grain of sand at the bottom of the ocean.
The only possibility is some method of propelling the bomb from the rocket.
But if such a method was available, there would be no difficulty up there.
No, gentlemen, I can't see any hope.
Professor Blandford, you must radio the
Stardust and order them to stay up there.
That means a death sentence for the crew.
We have no choice.
That's all, gentlemen.
MICHAEL:
Well, that's it, professor.
Metal fatigue and your precious propulsion unit split open like a bad egg.
- Any ideas, Mike?
- I'm afraid not.
What are you looking glum about?
Not everybody gets a chance...
...to go out the way we will. Personally,
I'm gonna get a big bang out of it.
- You all agree that we stay up here?
CREW: Yes.
I'm not.
I still say we can land in the desert.
We've been over that before. Pipe down.
- How dare you...
- Commander, we're all with you.
- I'm gonna be sorry that this lady...
- Don't get sentimental about me.
- I have only myself to blame.
- Well, I'm not prepared to die like this.
Start the jets!
Get him back.
- You all right, Mike?
- Start those jets!
MICHAEL: Let's get him in the chair.
- He'll be all right now.
- Of all the crazy things to do.
- He was hysterical.
- He didn't know what he was doing.
- Jimmy, can't I get a message through?
- Lf I could send a story I'd feel better.
- No, the atmospherics are terrible.
They lost contact for the time being.
Too bad. I wonder what they're thinking about us down there.
Dr. Blandford.
ROSS: Any news from them, sir?
- Radio report, no contact.
- Will you inform General Barnett?
- Yes, sir.
I'm trying to get through to the president's aide.
- Is there much chance even if...?
- Hello? Top priority.
Cross circuit 3, please.
Hello, Captain Carter?
Colonel Galloway here.
You've got to get the president's authorization...
...for YX-140 to take off. It's the last chance for these people up there.
At least there's a possibility that she'll reach the rocket ship and get off the crew.
Yeah. Yes, I'll leave everything to you.
Remember, there's only four hours left.
Right.
What is YX-140?
Our newest jet. Top-secret.
This latest model hasn't even been flown yet, but now's as good a time as any.
- But what's its range?
- Sergeant Kelly, please.
- Any hope of it getting up there?
- I don't know. Nobody knows.
Kelly, get my car around here right away.
It's the fastest thing we've ever had.
Well, it's nearly 5:00.
We haven't much time.
- What possessed you to stow away?
- Oh...
What do you mean, "oh"?
I tried to tell you a while ago, but you said you weren't interested.
I'm interested now.
Why did I stow away?
Because in spite of what I said, I couldn't see this happen and not be in on it.
What about the evil of science and the senseless waste of life?
- What's changed your mind?
- I haven't changed my mind.
My brother died testing a jet that was not a success.
He believed in it.
He talked just as you do.
I'm sorry, but I admire your brother's attitude more than yours.
- My father had the same attitude.
- Your father?
He knew that space flight was possible as soon as they found the right kind of fuel.
He spent his life searching for it.
Not that he got anywhere.
He was blown up in his own experiment.
- James Sheldon Hamilton.
- How did you know?
The fuel we're using is a development of his work.
If it hadn't been for his experiments, we couldn't have got up here.
It still seems to me that stowing away would be the last thing you'd do.
It wasn't planned exactly.
What about that story you wrote?
"Is it necessary? Is it worthwhile?"
Then you hide on the ship and come along and see.
It doesn't make sense, does it?
I expect it does, really. It's in your blood.
Your brother would understand it, so would your father.
You're not in such bad company after all, are you?
No, I'm not.
- Dr. Blandford. I must see him.
- I'm sorry, you can't without a pass.
Please. I'm Mrs. Noble.
My husband's in the Stardust.
Wait a minute, Mrs. Noble. I'll check.
BLANDFORD:
Memo, General Barnett in the War Office.
ROSS: Teleprint?
BLANDFORD: Yes.
"Unable to contact Stardust.
Last message received 1930 hours.
Blandford."
Atmospherics are bad. For a few minutes, we received their telex.
- Try again.
- Lf it clears...
- You'll keep on trying.
- Captain Ross, Mrs. Noble.
Hello, Mrs. Noble.
I'm afraid we haven't much news.
BARBARA: Is he all right?
- Mrs. Noble.
ROSS:
We nearly got through to them just now.
What are the chances, Dr. Blandford?
- Very small.
- But why can't they get down?
- What's wrong with the Stardust?
- Nothing at all.
They can't come down without bringing the bomb.
They could get down, but they won't.
- That is what I mean.
- There is a slight hope.
A plane has gone up.
She might reach the Stardust...
...although we don't exactly know.
- Any luck, Jimmy?
- No joy, skipper.
The static's sounding terrible.
Feeling better, professor?
Yes, thank you.
- I'd like to apologize, commander.
- That's all right. Forget it.
Anyone like some coffee? Sandwich?
- Professor?
- Thank you, ma'am.
I don't know about a sandwich, but I'll help you get the coffee.
You ever been in love, Lefty?
Yes, I have.
- Well, give. Who was it?
- My wife.
- Your wife? I didn't know you were married.
- She's dead.
- Oh. Oh, I'm sorry.
- There's no need to be sorry.
We were very happy together.
I've known you three years, but I've never seen you having a good time.
- We have different ideas of it.
- You can tell if a guy's having a good time.
Would you know
I was enjoying myself now?
- Are you crazy?
- No, I don't think so.
I've always wanted to achieve something, and I've done it.
To get up here.
What's happened now can't be helped.
Man, that's one way of looking at it.
- What do you make the time, Lefty?
- Just one hour to go, professor.
At least we know we've only got one hour.
What about the guy who just steps off in front of a bus, and bingo?
I met the right girl, got her to agree to marry me...
...and the story stops right there.
- Good place for it to stop, Jimmy.
Why so sour, Larry?
You and Barbara are happy.
Not really, Mike.
Barbara hated my work at Thunder Hill.
We were very happy once, but that was long ago.
- Coffee?
KIM: Here are the sandwiches.
Lefty, I want to go and have another look at that bomb.
- Will you come with me?
- Would it do any good?
We can try. It's better than sitting here waiting for it to go off.
Will you come?
KIM: What kind do you want, cheese or ham?
- I'll take cheese.
Okay. Thanks.
MAN [O VER RADIO]: Thunder Hill to Stardust.
Thunder Hill to Stardust. Can you hear me?
Hello, Stardust to Thunder Hill.
I am receiving you on Beam 3. Over.
BARBARA:
Larry.
This is Barbara.
Your wife, Larry.
Come back to me, Larry.
Please, you must come back.
MAN:
Hello? Hello? Can you hear me, Stardust?
JIMMY:
I'm still receiving you clearly. Stand by.
Tell Barbara everything's all right.
BLANDFORD: We will.
I have a message for your telex operator...
... James Wheeler.
It says, "I'm still wearing your ring."
And it's signed "Ellen."
Your message received and understood.
Thank you.
Blandford, can you relay a message to the
World Press Service from Miss Hamilton?
- My report will follow.
- Yes, just a minute.
Ready.
- Right.
- This is Kim Hamilton.
Now that I have shared this experience...
...I feel that the mission of the Stardust will be justified...
...if the explosion up here shows people the stupidity of a future war.
No matter what happens to...
They don't hear you.
I've lost them.
Five years of sweat and disappointments building this ship...
...just to have it blown to bits.
I don't mind going myself...
...but I hate to think of that bomb taking the Stardust with it.
Hurry up, before they find where we've gone.
Tell me something.
If things had turned out differently, would you have married me?
I think I would have.
Maybe it would've taken a lot more time to get around to it.
Mike. The airlock light's on.
MICHAEL:
Lefty? Professor Merrity?
LARRY:
Lefty?
Mike.
You can't. You'll break the vacuum.
I can't see them.
They're behind the stone tubes.
MICHAEL: What do they think they can do?
- They must have felt they had to try.
- They couldn't stand the waiting any longer.
- Yeah, well, the waiting's nearly over.
Mike.
There was a chance the fuse might have worked, but the acid's eaten through.
If we use our own propulsions, we can get it away...
...but it'll take both of us to do it.
- It's going.
- They've done it. Mike.
It's possible to get away now.
And leave them? Oh, Mike, you can't.
You mustn't.
That's why they went out there.
That's what they want us to do.
- Larry, take the turbos.
- Mike.
Jimmy, get in your seat.
Larry, switch on all jets.
Quick, man.
Something's wrong, Mike.
The jets won't fire.
The airlock door is still down.
Takes a few seconds to get the pressure back to normal. Keep the switches down.
[ENGLISH SDH]
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
This is KRKR-TV.
And now for the latest news.
Early tonight the captain of a Swedish icebreaker in the Barents Sea...
...reported seeing a strange red fireball come out of the sky.
Says the captain:
"It hovered above my ship for about a minute...
...and then headed south by southwest. "
Unquote.
Radio Cairo reports a herd of camels stampeded by a comet-like object...
...streaking southwest across the Sahara.
And in Cape Town, Africa, a Boer, no doubt...
...reports a similar flash across the sky.
And still one more, ladies and gentlemen.
A farmer in Auckland, New Zealand reported the strange glowing object...
...this time moving northeast.
Now, let's see.
Barents Sea.
Cairo.
Auckland.
Considering the time table of these reports...
...the stranger from space should be over our California desert in a matter of minutes.
No, no!
Harry! Harry help me!
Harry, help me!
Harry...
Harry, what will your wife say?
She'll say plenty, tonight anyhow.
Did you see the way she tore out of here in that big car of hers?
She only caught us nodding to each other.
She'll make up for all the things she hasn't caught us doing.
I'm so fed up.
I never should have agreed to go back to her once we were separated.
- Why did you?
- You know why.
I couldn't pry one nickel out of her.
That community-property routine only works for women.
A man hasn't got a chance.
Unless the wife dies.
I didn't say anything.
You were thinking it.
Not the same thing.
Didn't you say she was in the nut house for a while?
A private sanitarium.
What's the difference?
She was off her rocker, wasn't she?
I suppose so.
Probably got some fancy name for it.
Mostly she'd have these violent headaches.
And then she'd get falling-down drunk.
Still has them to this day.
What are you getting at?
Oh, come on, now, Harry.
Let's not be naive.
You've made a good start, now follow through.
- She's on the brink and you know it.
- I don't know it.
This Dr. Cushing seems to be helping her a lot.
She's tapering off on the bottle too.
Hardly took a drink all evening, you saw her.
All she needs is a little help.
Play the husband right to the end.
Once she's in the booby hatch, throw the key away.
That will put you in the driver's seat.
You'd make a wild driver, Harry.
With 50 million bucks.
Harry!
Harry!
Harry, help me!
Mrs. Archer. Mrs. Archer, what's the matter?
Here, somebody give me a hand.
We'll take her into the office.
Hey, chief!
Chief.
- Mrs. Archer.
- Harry.
Go on, folks, go on.
Go on, nothing you can do around here.
Go find Harry while I take care of Mrs. Archer.
- All right, let's break it up.
- Now, come on, Mrs. Archer.
Come on and sit down in the car.
I'll send somebody for some black coffee.
Black coffee?
You think I'm drunk, don't you?
- All of you! I'm not drunk, I'm not!
- Now, Mrs. Archer.
- You've got to believe me.
- Please...
It was right in the middle of the highway,
30 feet tall.
- It lit up the sky.
- I know that.
You don't believe me, do you?
Any of you.
I'll believe you, Mrs. Archer.
I'll believe you, just be calm.
Now, come on and sit down in the car.
Come on, take it easy and tell me all about it, slowly.
Hey, Mr. Archer.
Mr. Archer.
What is it, Charlie?
Oh, all right, I get the message.
She's over at the sheriff's office.
She's in kind of bad shape.
She's pretty hysterical.
You couldn't find me tonight, Charlie.
I took a cab home.
Sure, sure, I get it, Mr. Archer.
Thanks a lot.
So... So she's tapering off, eh?
Hardly took a drink all evening.
Must have been a bottle in the car,
I don't know.
- Did you find Mr. Archer?
- He took a cab home, chief.
Charlie, go get the riot gun.
We're taking a ride in the desert with Mrs. Archer.
Right.
Why the heavy artillery, chief?
There's a flying satellite...
...and a 30-foot giant a few miles out on 66.
A 30-foot giant?
Oh, no.
Hey, look. There it is.
Mrs. Archer's car, I mean, chief.
Where did you see it, Mrs. Archer?
You can think what you like.
It was right there in the middle of the road.
Yes, ma'am.
Come on, Charlie, let's look around.
What's up?
She off her rocker or something?
Don't look back, but as long as she's paying most of the taxes around here...
...we play along with her.
Let's spread out here.
You see anything, chief?
Come on.
Not a thing, Mrs. Archer.
No prints of any kind either.
Why would there be? I told you everything happened on the roadway.
I was standing right here.
It seemed to be reaching for my diamond.
That's another thing
I've been wanting to tell you, Mrs. Archer.
That diamond you're wearing would tempt the devil himself.
There are a lot of drifters in the desert...
...who'd commit murder for a well-cut piece of glass.
In other words, you're suggesting what I saw tonight was some desert tramp.
You're saying that, ma'am.
I'm only suggesting that you be more careful with that diamond.
I didn't run all the way to town just for a lecture, sheriff.
We'll be glad to escort you home,
Mrs. Archer.
No, thanks.
Boy, she's tearing out of here like she was heading for the moon.
Poor, mixed-up Mrs. Archer.
I feel kind of sorry for her.
Well, I feel a lot sorrier for her husband...
...if she catches him with that
Honey Parker he's got stashed at the hotel.
- What a doll.
- Yeah.
Well, come on, Charlie.
It's past midnight.
Town can't afford to be paying us overtime.
Good evening, Mrs. Archer.
Is there anything I can do for you,
Mrs. Archer?
Yeah.
Beat it out of here.
Don't talk to Jess like that.
Maybe you should marry Jess and hire me for the butler.
Hey. I said out.
You can go, Jess.
Yes, ma'am.
And as far as I'm concerned, you can go too.
Go back to Tony's and that woman you were mooning about.
Knock it off, will you?
Now, you pulled a boner tonight, and you know it.
Why, leaving me stranded at Tony's without a ride.
I wasn't in the mood for an argument in front of all those people.
I didn't feel like sitting there and watching you flirt...
...with that red-headed wench you call Honey.
For heaven's sake, Nancy.
Why, I hardly nodded to the girl.
Now, you listen to me, Harry.
I won't stand for any more of your two-timing.
You keep away from that girl in that hotel, you hear?
Your backdoor romancing split us up once already.
The next time there won't be any reconciliation.
You know, you're gonna flip your lid just one time too many with me, Nancy.
And you're gonna make one too many passes at some other woman.
My husband.
My gigolo, that's what you are.
You're a miserable parasite.
You're just after my money.
I was rid of you once.
Why did I take you back?
Why, why?
Why did you, Nancy?
Why?
Because I love you, Harry.
Why am I always fighting with you when I love you so?
I'm sorry.
But if you'd only show me once that you really cared...
...I'd do anything.
What's wrong with us, Harry?
I don't know.
Maybe it's me. Maybe I'm...
Harry, I've got to tell you something.
Only please don't make fun of me.
First, listen to the whole story.
Tonight while I was driving home...
You're going to think I'm crazy.
No, no. Go on, Nancy.
Harry, I saw a satellite tonight.
Oh, is that all?
You know, everyone's seeing satellites these days.
Not like this.
It came out of the sky and landed in the middle of the highway.
Harry, I almost hit it.
And a man, a giant of a man came out of it.
I could feel his hands at my throat.
I think he was after my diamond.
Well, I see you still have the diamond.
I ran in the desert, that's why I'm such a mess.
I told the sheriff and he didn't believe me.
I saw the look on his face.
He thought I was drinking.
Harry, you know I wasn't drinking tonight.
Oh, please, Harry.
You believe me, don't you?
Of course I do, sweetheart.
Now, you've had a terrible night.
I think you need some rest.
Now, it's late. Come on.
I'm gonna put you to bed and we'll go through this tomorrow.
Why can't you be nice like this all the time, Harry?
There.
Oh, now, I never meant to be mean to you, Nancy.
Any more than I wanted you to stay in that sanitarium...
...you know?
Well...
...things seem to worry you lately.
You know, like before.
I don't know.
Maybe it's my fault, huh?
For not making things easier for you.
Maybe it would be better if we separated again.
Now, I wouldn't want to cause another breakdown in your health.
Oh, Harry, I couldn't stand that.
I need you.
Oh, if you only knew how much.
You're all I have, Harry.
There you go.
That's why I've always liked this place.
We could be so happy here.
Just the two of us, no more arguments.
Here, Nancy. This will make you sleep.
I don't wanna sleep.
I feel much better with you here.
No more arguments.
Water.
There you go.
That's the girl.
Feel better?
Don't leave me, Harry.
Harry.
I need you, all to myself.
Hi, Mr. Archer. I was...
I was just saying arrivederci.
I thought you'd be waiting for me at your hotel.
You know I don't like you hanging around here alone.
You're not jealous of that clown, are you?
It's too early to go to bed.
Anyways, I'm sick of that fleabag you call a hotel.
And I'm tired of waiting.
All I do is wait, wait, wait.
Maybe you won't have to wait as long as you think.
She's cracking up again.
She's seeing satellites and giants.
Not only told me about it, but she spread it all over town tonight.
- Even had the sheriff out looking for it.
- Charlie was telling me about it.
This could be it.
When Dr. Cushing hears about it, he'll have her committed right away.
He's in Baker. I'll call him tonight.
Well, that sounds more like it.
I don't think I could take much more of this setup.
Well, anytime you get to thinking that way...
...remember this.
The Star of India.
It's the most famous diamond in the world.
And you play your cards right and it'll all be yours.
Someday.
Let's call Dr. Cushing.
- What do you think, Dr. Cushing?
- She's not well, Harry.
She's suffering from mental exhaustion.
And her drinking doesn't help her any.
You did well to send for me.
Jess.
Now, give Mrs. Archer...
...one of those every four hours, and two at bedtime.
Keep her very quiet and no alcohol.
There's not much we can do for her until she gets some rest.
You needn't come out, Harry.
Jess will see me to the car.
Doctor.
About last night...
Oh, that satellite business?
Probably overworked imagination.
- You think she's having a relapse?
- Mentally?
Well, let's hope not.
I'm afraid it'd kill her if she ever had to go back to that sanitarium.
She needs to be near you, Harry.
She seems to get a great deal of consolation from you.
Now, be patient with her, my boy.
And with the right understanding on your part...
...I have high hopes for her eventual recovery.
Oh, I'll be in town for a few days.
If you need me, just call.
Well, my faithful husband, no less.
You finally decided to come home.
What's the matter, Harry?
Couldn't you stand the suspense any longer?
Couldn't you wait another minute for the psychiatrist's verdict?
What did he say, Harry?
Does he think I'm crazy too?
No one thinks you're crazy, Nancy.
How nice.
Then you believe me.
You believe I saw the satellite.
It's not the first time someone has seen a satellite.
Right in the road, with a giant in it?
Don't be so condescending, Harry.
I know what you're thinking.
I know why Dr. Cushing was here,
I know who called him.
I called him.
He's here for your own good, Nancy.
And I know where you spent the night last night too.
You seem to have a lot of information.
Well, I don't like being tailed in my own home.
Here, your giant friend may come looking for this.
Harry, wait. Where are you going?
Ask Jess.
Wouldn't you like something to eat?
The doctor said...
Oh, Jess, quit mincing around and leave me alone.
Yes, ma'am.
Ladies and gentlemen, this is KRKR-TV.
And now, more news of high fliers.
Nancy Archer, the former Nancy Fowler...
... Heiress to the Fowler millions and owner
of the fabulous Star of India diamond...
... Has joined that ever-expanding
international society of satellite-seers.
From the Archers' palatial
home-away-from-home comes a report...
... That Mrs. Archer has not only been seeing
a sociable satellite...
... But its inhabitant as well:
A 30-foot giant.
Was he pink with big ears and tusks?
Well, maybe Mrs. Archer...
... who has recently been feuding
with her husband, handsome Harry...
... Has finally found a man
from out of this world.
A man who could love her for herself.
Come, come, now, Mrs. Archer.
A man can ignore $ 1 million,
but 50?
That's too much to ask
even from the man in the moon.
What happened?
So I'm crazy? I'm seeing things, am I?
Jess, get the car.
I'm going out to the desert and find that thing.
And you're going with me.
Well, don't just stand there, go on.
You're being ridiculous, Nancy.
There's nothing out there.
You don't believe me.
Well, you're wrong. You're all wrong.
You're drunk, Nancy.
Why don't you try to sleep it off?
Not until I've proved it to myself and to you.
We'll drive on the side roads.
I have a strange feeling it's out there somewhere waiting for me.
I'm certain of it.
And if it isn't?
Then I'm crazy and should be committed.
The car's out in front, ma'am.
Jess, get the revolver.
What's the gun for?
We're going hunting, remember?
Let's go.
Nothing.
Just sand and space.
Well, seen enough?
Keep driving.
There. Stop the car, Harry, there it is.
I don't see a thing.
I saw it flash behind those hills.
All right, all right, I'll turn around.
Hurry.
Well, now we've combed all through these hills.
You saw it.
There's nothing out here.
Just emptiness.
Well, shall we drive on a little further?
I'm sorry, Harry.
I'm sorry.
That's it. I did see it.
I told you. I told you!
I was right. I was right. It's real.
- It's real!
- Nancy.
Nancy, come back here.
Come back here.
Let's get out of here. Nancy.
It's real. It's real.
- Nancy, get away from it.
- I'm not crazy. I did see it.
- It's a satellite.
- Come here.
- Harry, touch it. I did see it.
- Nancy, come here.
Hurry, Harry!
Harry, help me!
Harry! Help me!
Help me, Harry!
Harry, help me!
Harry!
What have you done with Mrs. Archer?
Get out of my way.
You're not leaving this room until you tell me what happened to her.
You aren't gonna get away with it.
Give me the sheriff's office.
Get dressed and packed, quick.
What's the matter?
No time for questions and answers now.
Here, we're getting out of here.
What did you do?
Rob the First National Bank?
Shut up and get moving. Come on.
All right, all right.
Nobody wants to get out of this dump worse than I do.
Hey. Those are the only clothes I've got.
You finished yet?
You just got here.
If you saw what I saw, you'd have jumped out of your skin to get moving.
Here, zip me.
- Come on, come on, come on.
- All right, all right.
- Where we going?
- Out of here, but fast.
You going some place?
Miss Parker is leaving town.
It's kind of sudden, ain't it?
The night clerk here didn't know anything about it.
Well, she... She does now.
I'm sorry, Mr. Archer, but Sheriff Dubbitt wants to see you in his office.
The both of you.
You're making a mistake, Charlie.
Let's go.
Let me see, now. You got three sixes...
...you got the queen of hearts, that's the heart run...
...so safest card in the deck.
Hey, what do you want that card for?
And that's a gin.
I don't wanna play anymore.
Getting daylight already.
The chief's always worrying about the taxpayers' money.
Yeah? Oh, hi, Mary.
No, darling,
I wasn't dancing at Tony's Club.
I was out picking up a couple of guests for the sheriff.
Yeah, he's out in the desert now with a posse looking for the...
Oh, they did, huh?
On the pool house?
What do you know about that?
Yeah. They found Mrs. Archer.
I don't know how she got there.
Hey, maybe by a helicopter, huh?
Yeah, all right, Mary.
Will you take any messages that come in?
Yeah, we're on our way right now.
Yeah. Bye, sweetie.
We'll take your wife's Imperial, right?
Yeah, right.
Imagine your wife was home all the time on top of the pool house, loaded.
How serious is it, Dr. Cushing?
Too early to tell. But we should get her to a hospital as soon as she's strong enough.
Those hours of exposure on the roof didn't help any.
Especially the way she was dressed.
It's not the exposure that worries me, it's those scratches on her throat.
That's Mr. Archer now.
And Honey.
I never would have thought it.
Better let me do the talking, Dr. Cushing.
What's wrong with Nancy?
What happened?
I'll ask the questions, Mr. Archer.
- Now, suppose you tell me what happened.
- I'm in no mood for games, sheriff.
I wouldn't go up there if I were you, Harry.
There's some possibility she may have been contaminated.
There's evidence of some kind of radiation.
Of course, we can't be sure.
Now, tell me what happened out there,
Mr. Archer.
- Out where?
- Jess told us.
You drove Mrs. Archer out into the desert last night with his gun.
You came back alone.
Now, what happened to Mrs. Archer...
...and what happened to the diamond she was wearing?
He's lying. I left the house alone.
Right after you, Dr. Cushing.
That's right.
Harry was with me all evening.
We were stepping out for air when your deputy stopped us.
Dr. Cushing, it's time for that injection you ordered.
Thank you, nurse, thank you.
I wouldn't have believed it, Harry.
I'm very disappointed.
- There seems to be a difference...
- Be careful with that, nurse.
Exactly 0.75 cc.
One way or another.
When Mrs. Archer regains consciousness, she'll corroborate me, Sheriff Dubbitt.
Well, where does that leave us?
Nowhere.
Just don't try to leave town for a while.
And that means you too, Miss Parker.
We have nothing to hide.
We'll be around.
Come on, Honey.
I'll drive you back into town.
According to Jess...
...Mr. Archer drove his wife out into the desert last night...
...and came home alone.
One thing you can be certain about,
Jess is absolutely trustworthy.
He's been with Nancy since she was a little girl.
I know he's telling the truth.
What's the matter?
Our necks are way out if Nancy comes to and talks.
There is a way out if you've got the nerve.
Try me.
The serum that private nurse is using in her hypodermic needle, I...
I heard the doctor tell her that an overdose would be fatal.
Money certainly brings out the best in you, doesn't it?
Have you got the nerve?
Read the morning papers.
Slide over and drive to town.
I've got things to do.
Doctor. Doctor Cushing.
Something's happened to Mrs. Archer.
- Something's happened to Mrs. Archer.
- Astounding growth.
Meat hooks.
- Four lengths of chain.
- The chains you were expecting are here.
Good. I'll tell Dr. Loeb at once.
Meat hooks, four lengths of chain...
...40 gallons of plasma...
...and an elephant syringe?
The chains are here.
Well, Heinrich, what do you make of it?
Fantastic.
I've made every test in the book.
There's no diagnosis.
Look at this slide.
Dermal connective tissue.
Filaria?
If only it were filaria.
We'd have something to go on.
A beginning.
There's not even streptococcal infection...
...to incite the inflammation of the lymph channels.
What could it be?
I don't know.
I just don't know.
We may find our answer when we operate.
Giantism can result from an overactive forward lobe...
...of the pituitary fossa, as you know.
Then you think surgery is indicated?
Except for that one thing.
The blue-green color around the scratches at her throat.
I would venture to say...
...it is some sort of radiation...
...which we in medicine have never touched upon.
Fortunately, the dose she received was not deadly.
Then you... You feel there is hope.
With surgery? Yes.
We'll have to have the husband's permission to operate, of course.
There is always hope as long as there is faith, Raymond.
I almost gave you up, baby.
I've been reading the papers.
I told you what happened on the phone.
We've got problems again.
That new doctor, Von Loeb, thinks he can help her.
Bring me a drink, will you?
What's the matter?
Your conscience bothering you, Harry?
You know, the trouble with us is we've both got the same disease.
Money.
And happy ways of spending it.
I've missed you.
Has she talked yet?
She's still in a coma.
They're looking for me now to give them permission to operate.
That's great. That's wonderful.
You just hide out and let her blow up like a balloon.
You can pull now, Heinrich.
Steady.
Give me a boost, Charlie.
- Nothing.
- Yeah, I could see that from here.
Almost.
There's a ladder over there.
Charlie.
- What is it?
- I don't know.
But whatever it is, it wasn't made by a Japanese gardener.
Go get Jess.
Tell him to get down here pronto.
Excuse me.
Jess. Sheriff Dubbitt wants to see you.
Right away.
I thought you two might like a cool...
Did you ever see anything like this around here before, Jess?
A giant footprint.
Maybe Mrs. Archer wasn't so...
I've been thinking the same thing myself.
Hey, look.
There's another one over there.
- Hey, look. There's another one.
- Charlie.
We've got to keep quiet about this thing or everybody will think we're nuts.
Be dark in a half-hour.
We'll follow these, see where they lead.
- We will?
- Mrs. Archer has a station wagon.
Good. Run my car into town and get the riot gun, Charlie.
Bring a couple of grenades and some tear gas and flashlights too.
- Tear gas? Grenades?
- We'll leave as soon as you get back.
You better plan on being up all night tonight.
We've gotta have somebody in the office in case Jess and I wanna get in touch.
Sure. You know,
I'd like to go with you, chief.
There will be no charge for overtime.
Come on, Jess.
There's still some daylight left.
Let's follow these things.
Excuse me, chief.
Bring it up.
Amazing.
Here.
We'd better walk the rest of the way.
There's a radio phone in the car.
Shouldn't we call for help?
No use yelling for outside interference until we see what we got.
Harry must have brought her out here and left her.
And then this...
This giant must have taken her home and put her on the pool-house roof.
Amazing.
Look.
My gun.
He emptied it before he ran.
At what?
Over here.
Look.
The Star of India.
Mrs. Archer was right.
The thing was after her diamond.
Diamonds everywhere. Different colors.
Must be used to power this thing in some way.
Let's take this one and get out of here.
Charlie. Charlie.
The radio's shot too.
We might as well start walking.
We'll come back for all this stuff later.
It's gonna be a long walk.
I've known Nancy since she was born.
In those days, she was a beautiful child.
Fresh, young, full of the joys of life.
But in the last few years, after her marriage, she changed.
Her health seemed to rise and fall with the tide of her emotions.
A very sad case.
A case not infrequent in this supersonic age we live in.
I'm afraid I was unwise in advising her to take Harry back after they'd separated.
Who knows, my friend?
When women reach the age of maturity...
...Mother Nature sometimes overworks their frustration...
...to a point of irrationalism.
Like the middle-aged man of our age...
...who finds himself looking longingly...
...at a girl in her early 20s.
Harry!
What was that?
Harry!
Harry.
I'll get Dr. Cushing.
Harry. I want him here.
Nancy, Nancy, calm yourself. Morphine.
Harry's asleep in his room.
He'll be right here.
- Harry!
- Call the sheriff.
Harry.
Harry!
Sheriff's office, please.
And hurry, operator, it's urgent.
- Harry.
- Hello. Sheriff Dubbitt.
Have you found Mr. Archer yet?
No, ma'am, but I left messages everywhere in town.
Oh, she did, huh?
She is?
Yes, ma'am, I know it's an emergency.
All right, I will, right away.
Hi, Mary. I'm going over to Tony's Club and then I'm heading out to the Archers'.
If Sheriff Dubbitt calls in, tell him he'd better get out there too.
Thank you, baby. Bye.
No, there's no cutting in here at Tony's Club, buddy.
- Mr. Archer.
- Why, it's the deputy.
What can we do for you this time?
Your house has been trying to get you all evening.
- Didn't the bartender give you my message?
- He did.
And now you've delivered it in person.
Anything else?
No...
Well, yes, there is.
They say it's important. An emergency.
Well, thanks.
All right.
Let's see, now. Where were we, huh?
- Here.
- Oh, yeah.
Never should have kept this out of the papers.
The poor girl, she's had so much publicity all her life.
I'm afraid now there's no alternative.
We'll have to notify the authorities.
If you hadn't given her that sedative, there's no telling what would have happened.
Well, thank heaven we got the chains on her arms and legs.
- How long will the morphine be effective?
- No telling, with the size of her body.
But we'll have to keep her under sedation until the state police arrive.
I'll phone the authorities at Baker.
Operator.
Doctor! Dr. Cushing, it's her.
She's come to again.
- Dr. Cushing!
- Hither, nurse. More morphine.
Operator. Operator. Operator.
This is Mary, your operator.
What's going on there?
What's happening?
Hurry with that morphine, Cushing.
She's loose.
She'll tear the roof off.
Operator. Operator.
It's dead.
I know where my husband is.
He's with that woman.
I'll find him.
She's loose.
A tank couldn't have done a better job.
She... She's heading for town.
Hi, chief. I was just on my way over to the Archers'.
I think Mrs. Archer finally came to.
Say, they've been asking for you over there.
- Did you find anything out there?
- Get moving, will you?
Yeah, sure, sure, hop in.
Say, where's the station wagon, chief?
Doctor. Doctor, give us a hand with the door.
Here's the sheriff's car.
Holy Toledo. What happened?
Thank heaven you're here.
It's Mrs. Archer. She's on a rampage.
- We've got to warn the town.
- She's grown into a giant.
Never mind. Get into the car.
We'll explain as we go along.
Drive to town.
Uranium.
This is just make-believe.
A lot of junk to sell to the people.
It ain't like the old days when we could go out prospecting for gold...
...with a sluice box and water.
I can see it now.
Come on, Hazel. Come on.
Hey, hey, hey, Tony.
Something's happened to your lights.
I got eyes. I can see.
- Who needs lights?
- Well, I need another drink.
- Hey, Ton. Tony.
- Oh, you're a good fellow, Tony.
Attaboy, Ton.
- Mellow, mellow...
- Happy birthday, Honey.
Well, wouldn't you know it.
Can't you drive any faster?
What happened?
Was it a giant woman?
- Going toward town?
- Let's hurry.
Harry.
She'll tear up the whole town until she finds Harry.
Yeah, then she'll tear up Harry.
See if you can locate him and put him in the police car.
We'll try and draw her off.
I'll call Baker for help.
Come on, let's get out of here.
Let's get the sheriff.
- Hey, what's going on here?
- Harry!
It sounds like someone's calling your name.
Harry!
Harry!
It's your wife.
She's wrecking the town looking for you.
- Come on, I gotta get you out of here.
- No.
If she sees me out there, she'll kill me.
She's crazy.
Come on, Mr. Archer, we gotta get out of here.
You're a deputy. Do something.
I can't shoot a lady.
Give me the gun. Give me that gun.
No. No, no, Mrs. Archer.
Help me move this beam, Charlie.
She's dead.
No. No, Nancy. Nancy.
No! Nancy.
Nancy. Nancy, no.
Nancy, no.
Nancy, don't.
Oh, no.
- Don't, Nancy. You killed Honey.
- No.
Nancy, no. Put me down.
You killed Honey. Nancy, no.
Nancy, no. No.
You're crushing me. I can't breathe.
Hurry. Hurry.
She's got Harry. She's got Harry.
- Why doesn't the sheriff do something?
- She's squeezing him to death.
Put him down, Mrs. Archer.
Sheriff, you're not gonna use that on her.
What do you want me to do?
Put salt on her tail?
She's down.
Let's take a look.
Let's go.
All right, everybody keep back now.
Come on. Stand back there.
She finally got Harry all to herself.
Encode to Washington.
No signal from XRM since last reported at 0118.
- No further contact from XRM.
- That means trouble?
- Not necessarily.
- They cut off in the middle of a message.
- Could be radio trouble.
- What do people at White Sands say?
- No comment.
- Do you think they've crashed?
We don't think anything.
We just don't know.
- Excuse me.
- But, major...
Excuse me.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Jaffe.
Would you care to wait in my office?
- You'll be more comfortable there.
- No, thank you.
I'd better take the children home.
I want Daddy to come home with us.
He can't, Ginny. He's very far away.
Yes, very far.
Will you call me, please, if you hear any news?
Yes, of course I will.
The moment we hear anything.
Thank you.
Why would a guy with a wife and a couple of kids...
...wanna go on a crazy expedition like that?
Has man's first flight into space ended in disaster?
Dr. Eldon Galbraithe and his crew of adventurers...
...are unreported for many hours...
...and grave fears are felt for their safety.
Henry Jaffe, navigator of the spaceship XRM...
...last reported that the ship was approaching the planet Mars.
In the midst of a transmission in which he described...
...the fabulous ice-capped poles of the red planet, contact was suddenly lost.
All over the world, radio operators are trying to reestablish contact.
Dr. Galbraithe, I still can't get anything.
- Are you sure it's not the equipment?
No, no, that's okay.
We lost contact when we entered Mars' magnetic field.
Probably regain it as soon as we leave.
If we don't get it soon, people will be worried about us.
We'll head for home as soon as we complete the orbit, Henry.
John, look at this.
Ten degrees right, 15 degrees depress.
If only we knew what that green stuff is.
Perhaps it's a sort of moss or lichen.
If it's grass or a type of grass...
...there's no reason why there can't be life on Mars.
So near and yet so far away.
- I wish we could land.
- So do I, John.
But our mission is reconnaissance, exploration.
If we try to land now and crash...
...all the information we've gathered crashes with us.
We'll be back.
And next time, we will land.
Henry, lay out a return flight plan for 0200 departure.
Check.
- Herb.
Soon as your radio starts working again, tell them we made two orbits of Mars.
Equator at 30,000 feet, pole to pole at 20,000.
Complete photomapping all the way.
Tell them we've completed all assignments and we're coming home.
Right.
Here's your initial heading, John.
Good. Prepare for standard acceleration.
- Home and mother.
We're heading for the barn.
What a reception we'll get.
My creditors will be deliriously happy.
All rockets forward.
Rockets forward, check.
Cut off at 15 miles per second.
Cut off at 15 miles per second, check.
- All set?
Right.
Here we go.
Speed, 15 miles per second.
- Acceleration leveling off.
Good.
You all right, doc?
Okay here.
There it goes, the planet Mars.
- Sliding into the distance.
- It'll be there when we come back.
I'll drink to that.
Who's for a slug of coffee?
Hull temperature going up.
Acceleration increasing.
We've lost flying attitude.
We're spinning!
Reverse rockets.
Reverse rockets!
I can't. I can't make it.
Our speed has reached
30 miles per second.
Hull temperature above danger point.
Seventy-eight miles per second.
Hey. Hey, we've landed.
My head. I have a terrible headache.
Oh, I've never been knocked out like this before.
The acceleration must have been fantastic.
It was. Look here.
- What?
Over a hundred miles per second.
Over a hundred miles per second?
The indicator is knocked completely off the scale.
What do you make of it, doc?
- Where are we?
I don't know.
Mars was closest to us.
This could be one of Mars' polar snowcaps.
We can be grateful that we landed on snow.
It would have been a rougher landing without it.
Will we be able to take off again?
We won't know that until we get outside and check for damage.
I'll break out the oxygen helmets and pressure suits.
Wait a minute, we may not need them.
It feels to me as though we have plus-gravity.
Hank, will you turn off the magnetic gravity?
Check.
You're right. It's normal now.
So is the atmospheric pressure.
There seems to be plenty of oxygen out there.
- Well, this isn't Mars.
- No.
If it were Mars, the atmospheric density would be one-tenth of normal.
Well, there's one way to find out.
Wonderful.
Let's get some warm clothes on, it's cold out there.
Yes, sir. Thank you.
Hey, doc.
Doc, look at this.
A high background radiation count, about 0.5 milliroentgens per hour.
About three times greater than that of Earth.
Still not enough to be dangerous, though.
Some damage to control surfaces.
Not bad, but we'll need help to repair it.
Help?
How are we gonna get any help on this godforsaken planet?
Doc, do you have any idea where we are?
No, Hank, I'm afraid not.
At the speed we attained, we could be almost anywhere.
For the moment, let's say we're on a planet similar to Earth.
I suggest we do some exploring down below the snow line.
Herb, while we're packing some gear, suppose you try the radio again.
Mm-hm. Right you are, skipper.
- We're ready to shove off.
- Right you are, John.
You know, it's uncanny.
I've swept every radio band.
There's nothing.
It's as if radio waves had never been created.
Yeah, that is strange.
You know, if this is Venus or some other strange planet...
...we're liable to run into high-domed characters...
...with green blood in their veins, who'll blast us with death-ray guns.
And there we'll be with these.
These poor old-fashioned shooting irons.
- Let's rest a bit.
- Uh...
I can use it.
Uh...
I can still see the ship up there, above the snow line.
I'd say we've come about 12 miles.
Twelve miles in about four hours.
That's a dazzling speed of three miles an hour.
How fast were we traveling yesterday at this time?
Oh, we were only cruising,
38,000 miles an hour.
This is tougher, believe me.
See anything?
Forest, brush.
No sign of life anywhere.
- He's taking it hard, doc.
- Yes, I'm afraid you're right.
If Jaffe hadn't been the one man, the man we had to have...
...I never would have taken anybody with a wife and children.
Hey, John, doc.
Come here, will you? I found something.
- Think we ought to explore it?
- By all means.
Nature keeps most of her ancient secrets in caves.
Hey. Hey, doc, will you look at that?
The creature that made this must have been gigantic.
Look out.
Doc.
Come on, Hank.
I should have known the moment I saw that web.
But spiders as big as dogs?
Poisonous, probably.
We should be grateful none of us was stung.
Come on, let's get out of here, huh?
There's a clearing of some kind below.
Let's have a look.
Yes, I think you're right.
It's several miles away.
It'll be dark by the time we get there.
Let's bed down here for the night.
Jaffe, look out!
Doc, keep down.
Let me get a shot at him.
Hank. Hank, you all right?
- Yeah, I guess so.
- Come on, up.
Such inhuman strength.
I was as helpless as a baby.
- Were they men or animals?
- I don't know.
- God help us, this is Earth.
How can it be?
I don't know.
Look.
What have we got ourselves into?
Am I insane? Are we all insane?
No, Hank.
I refused to face the reality, but now I know.
What are you getting at, doc?
About a week before we took off,
I visited Dr. Ellender.
You're all familiar with his theory.
- Of time as a fourth dimension.
Yes.
It's an outgrowth of Einstein's theory.
Ellender says in effect that if you go fast enough...
...time slows down.
There's no doubt about this dilation of time with speed.
It has actually been proven experimentally.
Our instruments jammed at a hundred miles per second.
- We may have gone 10 times that fast.
Or a hundred times.
Man has unlocked the secrets of nature one after the other.
We've pierced the sound barrier with our jets.
We've unleashed the power of the atom.
And now this.
I recall the newspaper lads had a lot of fun with Ellender's phrase:
Breaking the time barrier.
Well, obviously, we've gone and done it.
While we were blacked out for what seemed like minutes to us...
...the slow centuries were passing on Earth.
My wife and children grew old...
...and died.
Years ago.
Let's see what we can find out from the dates on those other monuments.
The latest date I found was 2188.
Even that marker looked very old.
I found several 2188s.
Probably the year of a great catastrophe.
Such as an atomic world war?
Yes, of course. The high radiation count.
Let's say that 2188 was the fatal year.
The year in which mankind destroyed itself...
...and poisoned the air and the soil of the Earth with radioactivity.
In, say, 200 years...
...the radiation might die down to the level at which we found it.
But those brutes who attacked us last night...
Do you mean to say that's all that's left of the human race?
I don't know.
Undoubtedly, they are mutates.
Descendants of civilized humans who survived the atomic blasts...
...but whose reproductive cells were damaged by radiation.
You mean that monster we buried back at the camp...
...is the heir to 10,000 years of human progress?
Well, the spiders were mutates too.
Who knows what other monsters exist on Earth?
Who knows?
But perhaps some normal humans do survive.
We've got to find out.
I think that answers the question of where we are.
Take a look up there.
Those can only be the Rockies.
And this could be Montana or Idaho.
Not so far north. Too arid.
More likely Colorado or northern New Mexico.
But if this is Colorado or New Mexico, where are the cities, the towns?
Denver, Albuquerque?
- What is it, John?
- Take a look up there.
That's not a brush fire.
It's too thin a column of smoke for that.
Look, it's good military procedure to send out a scout.
- Cover me.
- Now, wait a minute.
I'll be all right.
Just cover me, that's all.
Wonder why a fellow like that isn't married.
He was.
Met a girl when he was a young ensign at Pensacola.
Married her.
They had a couple of fine children.
He was stationed in Japan after the war...
...and his wife and children flew out to join him.
Their plane went down in mid-Pacific.
No trace of it was ever found.
I'll take him, skipper.
Don't waste ammunition.
We haven't got much.
- They're getting behind us, doc.
- Come on, let's get out of here.
Hold up. We're cut off this way.
Up there, a tunnel or a cave.
Well, I guess they aren't going to storm us after all.
I hope this tunnel isn't occupied.
- All clear in there?
All clear as far as I can see.
He's coming to.
- Everybody all right?
- Huh...
- Everybody but you.
- I'm okay.
No bones broken, I guess.
- You all right, John?
- Yeah, I'm all right.
They're still down there.
At least we're safe here for the time being.
There's an optimist for you.
A pessimist would have said we were trapped here for the time being.
Well, the pessimist might have a point there.
It's a cinch they're not just gonna go away.
Did you save the food?
Yes, and the water.
Enough for a few days.
- What about guns and ammunition?
- We couldn't recover your gun.
I'd say we have maybe 30,
40 rounds of ammunition.
Doc, John, come in here.
Hank?
Yeah, doc, I got it.
- Look at this.
- Stainless steel, apparently.
No, it's some new kind of metal.
Terrific hardness.
Doc, John.
Doc, the door! John.
I couldn't stop it, doc. I couldn't stop it.
Take it easy, Hank.
There's an invitation, boys, if ever I saw one.
A command performance.
They're not even giving us a chance to say, "No, thanks. "
Put your guns away.
Anyone who could box us in like this could kill us just as easily.
Come on.
Receptionist stepped out for a cup of coffee.
Hey, look at this.
It's a lens of some kind.
We're being spied upon.
Yes, there's probably a microphone planted here somewhere.
Do not touch that.
- Can you hear us?
Yes, I can hear you.
You speak our language.
- Why don't you greet us face-to-face?
In good time.
You bear weapons?
- Yes.
Put them on the table.
Go through that door.
You may leave your burdens.
They will be sent for.
You will wait here, please.
- Which of you is the leader?
- I am Dr. Galbraithe.
I am Timmek. It was my voice you heard.
This is Mr. Ellis, Mr. Borden, Mr. Jaffe.
Why did you come here?
We took refuge in your tunnel because we were attacked by savages.
- Mutates, we took them to be.
- Mutates?
I do not know the word.
It is from the Latin, a very ancient language.
- It means, "The changed ones. "
- Changed ones indeed.
We call them the beasts.
Your manner of speaking, your appearance, is strange to us.
Who are you?
We left Earth on an exploratory flight into space on the 17th of March, 1957.
And in space, you encountered an exponential time displacement.
Yes. You are familiar with Dr. Ellender's theory?
His is one of the great names of our scientific past.
The world was on the verge of proving his theories...
...when the great blow fell.
You speak of a great blow.
In our travels, we have seen nothing but desolation.
Where are the cities, the roads, the bridges, the great works of man?
What happened to them?
Armageddon.
The slaughter of humanity.
An atomic war no one wanted...
...but which no one had the wisdom to avoid.
And this is all that's left of the human race?
Your people here and the beasts, as you call them, above?
Yes, so far as we know.
They have the same heritage as ours.
But the scourge of radiation poisoning...
...distorting their minds and their bodies, generation after generation...
...set them back to the dark ages of man's history.
They speak a strange, primitive tongue.
Such as the Stone Age man must have invented...
...in the dim beginnings of the human race.
If you are convinced of our peaceful intentions...
...may we have our weapons back?
Why do you want weapons?
Do you think you will need them here?
- No.
- Then against whom would you use them?
Against no one here.
We come in peace, I assure you.
Then you'll need no weapons.
I suggest we take no risks and keep them.
We hope you feel no offense,
Dr. Galbraithe...
...but Mories is right.
If you come in peace, you'll have no need of weapons.
Should you leave, we will discuss returning them.
Father, these men are our guests.
They must be tired and hungry.
Of course. You've had a most difficult time.
Garnet will see to it that you are made comfortable.
We are honored to meet your daughter.
- Will you come with me?
- Excuse me.
We have guessed, from what we have seen...
...that we are at least four centuries from the world we knew.
It is more than five centuries.
By your ancient timekeeping method...
...this is the year 2508 A.D.
- Delicious, simply delicious.
- All produced underground.
- Even these fruits and vegetables?
- Yes.
We have lamps that give the exact equivalent of sunlight.
- Remarkable.
- It was the only way to survive.
Many people took refuge underground during the great war...
...but starvation forced them to eat food produced on the surface.
- And they were poisoned by radioactivity?
- Yes.
But the radioactive count is safe now.
Please don't get up.
Where would you like your belongings?
Oh, put them down anywhere.
Elaine, this is Dr. Galbraithe.
- How do you do?
- Hello.
- John Borden.
- How do you do?
- Henry Jaffe and Herbert Ellis.
- How do you do?
Elaine is Elda's assistant in the scientific section.
Elda sends his greetings.
At your convenience...
...he would be pleased to show you our power plants, our laboratories.
Anything else you wish to see.
Is she as beautiful as the women in your world?
Hmm? Uh, oh...
Yes. Yes, indeed, she is.
Radioactivity is below the danger level now.
Your people can return to the surface if they want to.
It is hard to discard centuries of tradition.
The beasts are there.
They've killed many of our people.
But you can defeat them, they're savages.
In any fight, a civilized man should win.
My people are sick of war.
We are safe here and comfortable.
But the surface of the Earth was meant for man.
He wasn't meant to live in a hole in the ground.
Oh, I'm sorry. We're guests here.
A long, long way from home.
We have no right to criticize your way of life.
You will rest.
When you see more of our world here...
...perhaps you will agree it is not such a bad one.
Something's been puzzling me.
- May I ask you a question?
- Of course.
That little servant girl.
She's very pretty...
...but she seems different than the people we've seen here.
Deena comes from the world outside.
But I thought all the people on the surface were deformed.
- Beasts, as you call them.
- No, not all of them.
I have heard that the beast kill the ones who are not deformed or drive them away.
Deena wandered into one of our tunnels...
...half-dead of starvation, and we took her in.
I see.
Well, thank you very much.
I hope you rest well.
My word.
Do you think all the women here are as beautiful as the ones we've met?
I don't know. We'll find out tomorrow.
Well, I'm gonna get some sleep.
- It's been a fairly busy day.
- Fairly busy.
Well...
Home was never like this.
John, these people seem to have a high order of intelligence.
That's right.
Did you notice how they grasped the significance of what happened?
They seemed to know
Ellender's time displacement theory.
- Yes, they did.
- Well, isn't it reasonable to think...
...they may have discovered a way to reverse the time displacement?
No, Hank, it's not. I get the impression that their science is turned inward.
Concerned only with their immediate comfort and safety.
That nothing abstract or experimental interests them.
But assuming they did have the knowledge to reverse the time displacement...
...you still have the problem of repairing the ship and getting it ready to take off.
With their help, that ought not to be difficult.
Hank, I know you're eating your heart out to get back to your wife and kids.
But it's no good trying to find hope where none exists.
Face the fact that these people probably won't help us.
Why not? They're friendly enough.
They've got the skill to help us and the materials.
You'll find they're short of one important ingredient.
- What's that?
- Guts.
The courage to get out of their holes and fight.
- Good morning, gentlemen.
Good morning.
Dr. Galbraithe, the president of the council...
...would like to see you at your earliest convenience.
Very well, I'll be there directly.
These are very comfortable quarters.
Thank you.
There's a cold fish if I ever saw one.
Hank.
No use antagonizing anyone.
She might repeat what we say.
Ah. How do you like that crazy shower?
You step in, nothing to turn on.
The water sprays out automatically in just the right temperature.
- What's this you're doing?
- Well, we have a plan.
- That is...
- Good morning, did you sleep well?
Yes, thank you.
My, you are so much more muscular than our men.
Uh... The results of a misspent youth.
Got chucked out of school, had to go to work.
Strong back, weak mind, you know.
I like it.
I just wanted to remind you to visit us.
Just ask for the Scientific Section.
Anyone will direct you.
Well, the female of the species hasn't changed much.
Still goes for a good pair of shoulders.
If women vote here, Body Beautiful can campaign without his shirt...
...and get himself elected president.
- Aw, now, cut it out.
How do you figure these people?
Why are the women so vital, so full of life, and the men so different?
I'm having a talk with the head man.
If I find out anything, I'll let you know.
John, all the men we've seen look as if they didn't have a pint of blood between them.
What? What?
Oh, she can't understand English.
Can you, honey?
Pretty little thing, isn't she?
Lovely eyes, nice figure.
Oh, but look now, isn't that too bad?
She's got bow legs.
I have not.
Well, I'm a low-down cad, but I found out.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
- Have you been well taken care of?
- Yes, very well, thank you.
We will have much to talk about.
It's a wonderful thing, our being able to bridge the gap...
...between the centuries.
We will study the old books together.
Books that are ancient to us, but which were the life of your time.
May I speak of one thing, please, before we begin?
Our ship is only slightly damaged, but we need help to repair it.
Repair it?
You think you can reverse the time displacement that brought you here?
No, no, that is beyond us, I'm afraid.
It was a one-in-a-million encounter in space that brought us here.
We're not foolish enough to expect another such miracle.
It occurred to me...
...that we might use the ship to explore the Earth.
To see if other communities like yours exist.
Why?
Because I'm a man of science.
Because I have an obligation to humanity...
...to you, to other humans, if any survive.
It is a dangerous journey to your ship.
The beasts would have killed you if we had not taken you in.
But we were few, and we were not well-armed.
There are many of you and you have the ability to make powerful weapons.
We are a peaceful people.
We are sick of weapons and war.
If enough of your men go with us, the mutates won't dare to attack.
I will have to consult the council.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
Where are your friends?
They've gone to see the sights.
Why aren't you with them?
To tell you the truth,
I was hoping you'd show them to me.
To tell you the truth,
I was hoping I could.
Our power and light are derived from the heat of the Earth's core.
But we get almost everything else we need from nature's treasure chest, petroleum.
It is our basic raw material.
How about metals?
In the past, we had to send expeditions to the surface...
...to salvage metals from the ruins.
Our men underwent great hardships.
They were attacked by the mutates, as you call them...
...and suffered from extremes of cold and heat.
Now, in a community that is growing smaller, we have enough.
We use our metals over and over again.
Did you say your community was growing smaller?
An unfortunate choice of words on my part.
I should have said our community is becoming more compact.
Shall we go on?
Hello, Henry. Enjoying the tour?
It's all very interesting, John.
We're going to visit the machine shops.
Would you care to join us?
No, thank you, we'll see them later.
Excuse us. This way, please.
See you later, Hank.
Your friend has an air of sadness.
- Well, he left a wife and children behind.
- Oh.
Why did he go on the flight?
Well, he had a sense of duty.
He's an exceptionally fine navigator.
As matter of fact, he's a mathematical genius.
He knew he couldn't be replaced.
You didn't leave anyone behind?
No.
I had someone once.
I'm sorry.
Would you get in touch with the message center?
I believe they have several calls for you.
Dr. Galbraithe is viewing the historical records...
...of the years just after your flight.
You may see them, if you wish.
Thank you.
You know,
I think our friend's a little jealous.
Yes, he is.
You see, he takes it for granted that...
That you belong to him.
Do you?
Oh, no.
Well, I mean, I don't know.
Mories is very able.
He's a good administrator.
He'll probably succeed father as president of the council.
I see.
Aren't you going to look at the historical records?
No.
Aren't you gonna call the message center?
No.
Oh, honey, I didn't mean it.
They're beautiful, I swear it.
- Dinner, boss?
- No, I ate with Timmek and the council.
Any luck?
Will they help us with the ship?
I don't know yet. Where's Borden?
Cleaning up.
- I think he has a date tonight.
- Oh.
You know, the people here are wonderful.
All except that young troublemaker,
Mories.
He seems to be playing on their fears all the time.
They're scared of going out on the surface.
I called the turn on that one, didn't I?
Underground life seems to have drained all the courage out of these people.
They keep telling me we'll be safe and comfortable if we stay here.
Safe and comfortable, that seems to be all that life means to them.
I'm not so sure it isn't a tendency that existed even in our time.
Look, here are the pioneers:
Hardy, self-reliant, rugged.
Here we are a hundred years later, not so hardy nor self-reliant nor rugged.
And here they are, 500 years later.
No strength, no guts, no nothing.
I say that man was not meant to live in a hole in the ground.
Well, I've got to go.
Uh-huh. Don't tell me you've got a date to see the power plant.
No, but I thought I might be able to line up a way out of here.
Garnet's promised to show me an old tunnel that'll take us out to the hillside.
Fine night for it.
Full moon, if I remember.
- Lay off, Herb.
It's all right, Hank.
I don't mind. I'll see you later.
Well, it's nice to see the old boy feeling so chipper.
The women are wonderful, aren't they?
So much more vital than the men.
You know, I'm a widower and a grandfather...
...and I'll never see 50 again.
But this afternoon, I had the unique experience of being flattered...
...sought after and catered to by several beautiful women...
...who competed for my attention.
Gentlemen, I can only describe the experience as being...
...well, exhilarating.
- Ha, ha, ha.
The moon, it's so beautiful.
Have you never seen the moon before?
No, not like this.
Never out in the open before.
I'm afraid the books are wrong.
What books?
Romances that tell about your time.
The men were always strong and fierce and reckless.
Whenever they were alone in the moonlight with a girl, they made love to her.
What kind of books have you been reading, anyway?
You like me, I know you do.
I think you're beautiful.
More beautiful than...
I like you very much.
- I love you.
- No, don't say that.
I'm a stranger, an outsider here, and I must leave someday.
No, no. You'll stay here with me.
You're like the great men we read about.
Strong, brave, unselfish.
You're pacing like a caged tiger, old boy.
Got problems?
After last night, I think we've all...
Now, honey, don't look at me like that.
Wait a minute, Deena.
We want to help you.
We want to help your people if we can.
All your people are not beasts, are they?
You're pretty, Deena.
You are, Deena, I swear it.
- But he said that my legs were...
- Aw...
Forgive me, honey.
So help me, I didn't mean it.
I've been told that the beasts hate children that are not ugly.
That they kill them, drive them away.
- Is that true?
- Yes.
I was very young, but my mother told me...
- Well, did you talk to the council again?
- Yes.
They won't cooperate.
They refused to equip a party...
...to help salvage the supplies and instruments from the ship.
We're trying to help them and they just won't be helped.
We'll have to take one thing at a time.
Forget the ship for now.
The first thing to do is to get to surface.
Fight our way out and establish a base.
Right, get a foothold and turn it over to these people.
Show them how to live on the face of the Earth.
I'm not so sure they'll go up, even if we make it perfectly safe for them.
I think they may, because if they don't, their race is doomed.
Hasn't it struck you as odd that we haven't seen any children?
Sixteen and 17-year-olds, yes, but no children.
I did some snooping around yesterday, and not just the guided tour.
I found a sort of combination nursery-hospital.
There were 14 kids in it.
Fourteen kids in a population of 2000.
And they weren't strong healthy kids.
They were poor, bloodless little things.
I would say one more generation...
...and this branch of Homo sapiens will be extinct.
The world's a big place.
There may be other pockets of survival.
Australia, Greenland, who knows?
But if this is the human race, the human race dies too.
Yes.
Yes, we need these people.
We have to save them in spite of themselves.
All right, we'll go to the council, ask for weapons, nothing more.
I've seen the shops, they can build anything.
We'll go it alone.
There's one obstacle. Mories.
Time after time, it looked as though we might talk them into something.
But he always jumped in and turned the council the other way.
Well, that's my fault, I'm afraid.
He's insanely jealous.
He wants Garnet, and she...
Well, go ahead, old man, say it.
She wants you.
Garnet's a wonderful girl, John.
Why shouldn't she prefer you?
You're three times the man he is.
Oh, let's not worry about Mories.
We can do business with Timmek if we catch him alone.
And they will say they are doing it for us, for the future of our people.
But among themselves, they have conspired to get weapons by deceit and cajolery...
...to enslave us, to throw our lives away in a war of conquest.
How can they repay our kindness with such treachery?
We see in them all the ills of the 20th-century man.
Greed, aggressiveness, brutality.
The passion to dominate that made a shambles of the Earth.
I am stunned.
Are you sure?
Nihka and Jule listened with me.
Garnet assures me they are kindly, unselfish.
Our women seem to have lagged behind in their evolution into reasonable creatures.
They actually admire these reckless and brutal men.
We shall see.
If they try their deceit and cajolery on me,
I will know how to deal with them.
You must see to it that they do not recover their firearms.
I make you personally responsible for them.
Deena, try to remember, what else did your mother tell you?
She said that the beasts did not drive all the children away.
There were so many of them.
- Normal children you mean?
- Yes.
They needed them to work.
They were very cruel to them, but they did not drive them away.
- I see.
John?
John.
Johnny, town meeting. We're gonna get a chance to sell our bill of goods.
Coming, Herb.
I love him.
Herb?
Oh, now, listen, Deena...
Hi, honey.
You ready, Johnny? They're waiting for us.
Sure.
All we ask are weapons, food and water, and building materials.
Your workmen can make the weapons for us.
With them, we will repel any attacks and establish a safe base of operations.
With the material, we'll build a change of blockhouses...
...linking them with electric fences such as you use to protect your ventilator intakes.
We will gradually encircle an area of land in the valley below.
Fighting no more than is necessary to keep from being interfered with.
We propose to do this ourselves.
If your men care to join us, we will welcome their help...
...but we do not ask for it.
When a suitable area has been secured...
...you will have the option of living there or not as you wish.
But we are safe here.
Why should we subject ourselves to the heat, the cold...
...the discomforts of the surface?
Because if you remain here, burrowing in the ground like moles...
...your children will die.
How many children do you have here?
In each generation, fewer are born.
And of those, fewer live.
Your children need the sun.
Do you condemn them to death?
Do you condemn your people to extinction?
We are well aware of the problem.
Our scientists have a solution within their grasp.
These people seize upon it as a pretext.
They lie when they say they want to help us.
They want to enslave us...
...to use us for fighting their senseless wars of conquest.
- But they say...
- They say they want the weapons.
And with the weapons, they will be the masters and we will be the slaves.
That's not true.
I'm sorry, but Mories is right.
We must solve our own problems.
Weapons have been the curse of mankind.
We have never made weapons here, and we will make none now.
Father, Mories is wrong.
Those men are kind and sincere.
This bickering, this conflict, is new to me.
I don't know.
You must face it, Father.
We are a dying people and they want to help us.
But Mories heard them plotting.
Mories is jealous. It's poisoned his mind.
Perhaps he misinterpreted what he heard.
Father, I love John Borden.
Could I be wrong about him?
I don't know.
With your permission.
Yes, James, thank you.
- Garnet is with Timmek?
- Yes.
What is she telling him?
She believes Dr. Galbraithe and his men are sincere.
I suppose Timmek is wavering.
He is considering her arguments.
These are violent men, James.
You and I know that.
They will try to get their weapons.
- They must not get them.
- I know, Mories.
I have them safely hidden in my own sleeping quarters.
Who is that? Get away from there.
Why can't they see that Mories is lying?
It sticks out like a sore thumb.
Garnet will speak to her father.
Timmek, Timmek, Timmek.
James is dead.
Killed by a blow on the head.
No. No!
The weapons. The accursed weapons.
Good afternoon, sir.
Search.
Can I help you?
What are you looking for?
I don't understand.
What is this?
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
The others are coming.
John.
Don't...
Get off me.
Let go of me. What do you mean by this?
Let go of me.
The other one. Jaffe!
What does this mean?
We found these here.
I'm sorry, but surely there's no great harm done.
No harm?
Is that all a human life means to you?
A human life?
The man who took the weapons killed James.
No, that's impossible.
What is all this blasted nonsense?
Are they playing games or something?
No games, Herb.
They found the guns here.
What? The guns?
Someone killed James to get them.
Killed James?
Oh, now, doc,
I had nothing to do with it.
Violence, lies, murder.
They all go together.
I am an old man.
I wish I had died before I saw a day such as this.
Bring them to the council chamber.
We have decided what is to be one with you.
Decided? Without a trial?
Without giving us a chance to defend ourselves?
What defense can there be?
You wanted the weapons and you took them.
The facts speak for themselves.
This is our decision.
You will be put out of our tunnel exactly as you entered it.
You will be given food and water.
Your weapons will be returned to you.
You will have neither more nor less than you had when you came.
That's the equivalent of a death sentence.
We will try to shut you out of our minds as if you had never been here.
You will be sent out two hours after the sun sets.
That is all.
Garnet, we had nothing to do with it.
I must see Timmek.
I'm sorry, he is not to be disturbed.
This has been an ordeal to him.
He must see me.
I know who hid the weapons.
The weapons? I will tell him.
Will you wait here?
Mories did it.
I saw him hide the weapons.
Find him.
See that she is taken care of.
We mourn for Mories, who was our friend...
...but whose fatal weakness of character led to hatred, treachery, death.
But we must be thankful that a terrible injustice was avoided.
We all join in asking forgiveness of these brave men...
...who are willing to risk their lives to help us.
Now we, in turn, must help then.
I direct our artisans and craftsmen in particular...
...to give Dr. Galbraithe and his men their complete cooperation.
Hello, Deena, how do you feel?
Fine, thank you.
You all right, darling?
Another day or so and you'll be good as new, Deena.
Hi, Deena, how are you?
Fine.
Counted your fingers lately?
I had a hunch about that, so I fired it from a vice.
Powder too strong or barrel too weak?
A little of each, I guess. It's not easy for lads who never made a gun...
...to come up with a good one.
- That's quite evident.
How's the recruiting, doc?
Timmek thinks he's persuaded about 20 of his young men to join us.
What does it matter whether you have 20 or a hundred?
They will fail you just as that weapon did.
They'll not stand fast when danger threatens.
Not one of them has ever fought before.
Then we'll go it alone.
But you'll be killed.
The beasts watch our tunnels day and night.
You may kill 20, 50 of them, but there are hundreds.
Can you kill them all?
No. You don't need to.
We don't need to, Deena?
Only the ugly ones fight.
They are the masters.
The mutates would be the only ones we'd have to contend with.
And they may not be as numerous as we think.
Well, even they might be too much for us.
How do we fight several hundred savages with pistols that burst?
With ammunition that misfires?
If only we had something more powerful than pistols to fight with.
Against those monsters, a battery of field artillery wouldn't be too...
Hey, wait a minute.
I think I've got it.
What's the simplest, hardest-hitting piece of artillery you know of?
A hunk of pipe with the wallop of a field gun.
Of course, a rocket launcher.
The good old bazooka.
Henry, I think you've hit it.
We'd have to give up the firearms, but I think it's worth it.
I certainly agree. Hank, it's your baby.
- Get started on it, will you?
- Right, doc.
- Are things about ready?
- About as ready as they'll ever be.
Good.
We just had another talk with Deena.
It seems that the mutates' selection of a leader is straight from the Stone Ages.
The brute who kills all his rivals becomes leader.
And he holds the office until someone kills him.
For a long time now, the leader has been a charming fellow called Naga...
...who seems to have all the sweetness and lovability of a mad dog.
If we could get him, it would simplify everything.
Well, maybe we'll get lucky.
Maybe we will.
Well, we'll find that out tomorrow.
I regret we are unable to give you more active assistance.
Your workmen have given us the assistance we need.
Good luck. I wish I could go with you.
Whatever happens, our thanks.
Open the door.
That passage there.
It's got ambush written all over it.
Let's find out.
Right you are, my boy.
See if this little old gadget works, huh?
I guess that did it.
Look out.
Ammunition, Hank.
Watch it, John.
- He's not a mutate.
- Eh.
Deena said they wouldn't fight.
Reinforcements coming.
- Hank.
- Yes, sir.
Good shot, Herb.
Suppose you take our prisoner back, have Deena question him.
Find out what they're likely to do.
Then load up with ammo and come on back.
All right.
- Mm-hmm.
- Come on, handsome.
Come on.
Go.
They seem to be gathering in that thicket down there.
Wanna try a long shot?
Check, skipper.
Okay, John.
Hit the jackpot, skipper.
Here they come.
Deena.
What did you wanna go and bring Deena for?
Bring her? She popped out before anybody could stop her.
She brought me.
Well, what about the prisoner?
Did you get his story?
We got his story all right.
He thinks Naga is going to order the people back to the caves.
- That's not good.
- What about Deena?
- Don't you think we ought to send her back?
- No.
I can help.
You probably can.
If they are holed up in caves...
...we'll have a lot of palavering to do.
We can use her.
All clear down there?
All clear. After that last shot...
...they took the hint and kept going.
- Come on.
Well, are they in there or not?
Look.
This boy probably tried to make a break for it.
Oh, he's just a kid.
Murdering swine.
Question is, where are the rest of the people?
Herded into a couple of the big caves, probably.
Well, there's one way to find out.
Wait a minute, Hank.
Good military procedure to send out a scout. You said so yourself.
- Cover me.
- Now, Hank.
- This isn't your kind of racket. I'll go.
- No.
- I'm grabbing the check on this one.
- Hank.
Let him go, John.
Well, it's pretty bad, but it could be worse.
A little lower and it might have punctured a lung.
Naga says he has killed many of my people.
He says he will kill all of them.
That settles it.
We've got to get them out.
But how? If we blast them out, we'll kill every man, woman and child in the cave.
Deena, tell Naga he's a coward, a killer of children.
- Tell him to come out and fight me.
- No.
Wait a minute.
Are you out of your mind?
Go tell him, Deena.
Naga. Naga.
Naga says you do not fight like a man.
He says you use thunder and lightning on your side.
Tell Naga I'll leave my lightning and thunder behind me.
Tell him I'll fight him with this and this.
Naga.
- He says he will fight you.
- You haven't a chance...
...against those animals.
- Yes I have, Herb.
I'm supposed to be a civilized man.
I'm supposed to have an advantage up here.
You have no advantage.
This is nothing but a matter...
...of strength and reflexes.
The savage has the advantage.
I'll plug him as soon as he shows his ugly face.
Don't do it, Hank.
They'd kill every human in the cave.
Well, he's got only one eye.
No depth perception.
Take it easy, Hank.
Keep on his blind side, John.
Tell them I'm the chief now.
Tell them to go.
Chief is dead. Long live the chief.
You see, the water lines must go in first.
Then there will be no delay in other operations.
Yes, it's quite clear. Thank you.
Sir.
I would hardly have dared hope for this.
You have accomplished so much in a few short months.
Everywhere I look, I see new marvels.
I am.
You are. He, she or it is.
We are.
You are.
They are.
That's good. That's very good.
Now, let's try the verb to go. Ready?
I go.
You go.
He, she or it goes.
There is one of your marvels.
The children of the men we once hated...
...learning our language so that they may work with us.
Marvel in more ways than one.
Jaffe will never forget the loss of his family.
But so long as he has children who need him, he won't be too unhappy.
A few months ago, some of those children were listless, puny little things.
Which are the puny ones now?
What we're looking at may well be the rebirth of the human race.
THE MYSTERIANS
Isn't it great ?!
- They will dance all night.
Etsuko, would you like to dance with me ?
Sure, shall we ?
- Yes !
Hey Shiraishi, why don't you dance with Hiroko ?
Brother !
What's going on with you ?
You're hurting Hiroko's feelings.
Why did you break your engagement with Hiroko ?
She is concerned about you.
That is not like you.
I can't ... I can't marry her.
Unfortunately, I must stay here in this village.
That's not you at all. What do you have to do here anyway ?
Go back to the festival.
Hey... Hey... Look.
Fire,  Fire !
Where is my brother ?
-Your brother ? He ran to the fire.
The flames are huge
Follow me
Over here !
- Over here !
Wait !
What is it ?!
You are Mr. Shiraishi, right ?
The fire is spreading fast.
It's best to stay here.
You don't get it
We can't just stand here !
We're going to put it out !
But that's too dangerous !
We are old enough
Let's go, go !
Here we go
- We'll stop it !
Out of the way
Stand back !
Gee, this fire is big.
What do you think we should do ?
Oh boy.
I wasn't expecting this.
Let's run
Run !
Run !
Blimey !  Zounds !
DOOOOH !
Mr Atsumi is here to see you.
How do you do ?
Fine ...
Let's go there.
It seems that Shiraishi isn't doing well.
I wonder where he is now with his theories
- Well ...
He wanted me to give you this.
He is still working on it...
A report on Mysteroido !
What is Mysteroido ?
-It's the name of a planetoido.
He believes there is a small cluster of planets between Mars and Saturn
But before that, it used to be one big sized planet. That's according to Shiraishi.
But to us, it is still a mystery, hence the name: Mysteroido.
You don't seem to believe much in
Shiraishi's theories.
Nope.  I'm not bold enough to believe in theories like that.
That's rather strange.
What is?
Well, a real scientist would have finished his report.
Hello ?
He's here.
Please hold the line.
Atsumi, it's someone from the university.
Sure.
Hello, Atsumi here.
What ? Mount Fuji ?
Which village is it ?!
Yes. I understand.
There is an earthquake right where Shiraishi lives.
I hope Shiraishi is fine.
I dunno if we will be able to talk to the villagers.
What do you mean?
There is a lot of radioactivity in that area.
Really ?
Between ourselves, I don't think many of them are still alive.
Something unusual must have happened to them.
Let's go that way.
That's weird.
It wasn't like that yesterday at all.
Thank you for coming.
- Thank you.
Incredible !
I can't believe a Shinto shrine was standing just right here.
If that's the case, then the village should be standing right over there.
It's as if something has turned the place upside down.
We haven't found one trace of radiation here.
Strange ...
It was radioactive yesterday.
Really ?!
- Yes.
What do you think ?
Mmm... Let's carry on.
Shiraishi was here for health reasons, ja?
- Yep.
He was the best in his field.
Jolly good. Shall we see where the fire took place then?
Let's go there.
What's going on ?
- let's see.
All the fishes are dead!
They must come from upstream!
Right, let's investigate.
We go!
- Jawoll !
Something's burning.
The tyre is smoking.
- What the?!
The road is burning hot !
It's radioactive.
What's that  ?!
Oh bollocks !
Let's go back !
Fall back ! Fall back !
Hold that !
Hurry ! Schnell !
Mr. Atsumi.  Etsuko Shiraishi from Tokyo is waiting for you at the hotel.
Thanks.
Captain.
Thank you for coming.
What is this thing ? Is it true that weapons can't stop it ?
Yes indeed.
It fires some sort of heat ray.
So it did burn the whole area then?
What ? The monster is approaching the power station ?
Is that far from here ?
Hello ? Hello ? Hello ?
Emanuelle ! Emanuelle !
Oui ?
We must leave ! Hurry !
- yes !
First battalion reporting !
What ? The 3rd battalion ?
Captain!
Yes ? Yes ... Go to the city at once!
We are under attack!
By order of the army, all citizen must evacuate!
By order of the army, evacuate to the fields!
I think Shiraishi's studies are linked to all this.
You think so ?
By order of the army, evacuate to the fields!
Clear the area!
Clear the area!
Clear the area!
Clear the area!
Hurry across the bridge !
We are now setting charges !
What were those?
Prepare the charges !
Detonate !
The fires, the earthquake, and the monster ...
All this must be linked to someone, but nothing is for sure.
Our analysis of this part of the monster shows it to be made of a new metal.
It is made of a substance that cannot be found here on Earth.
The monster is not a living thing.
It is a remotely controlled roboto!
Who can have created such a thing?
And for what purposes?
I do not know. We are trying to discover who is behind all this.
Excuse me. Do you mean to say that this thing comes from outer-space?
Our enquiry is not over.
Professor !
Shiraishi's theory is correct.
This mystery comes from beyond the Moon
Are these UFOs?
Let's take a picture.
-Yes, certainly.
Ah, just the man!  Shiraishi was really on to something big.
Everything was foretold in his report.
Professor, I'm done.
It's their base.
No doubts about it.
They travel by rocket?
- I don't think so.
According to Shiraishi, they use an artificial satellite.
They can do as they want from up there.
Professor, I saw some UFOs at the village.
Really ?
So did Shiraishi's sister.
You should have told me first !
But... a scientist must have proofs
Sometimes you have to do without them.
The future of mankind is as stake.
No need for scientific rigor.
Tomorrow the press will be told and
I'll ask the help of all the scientists.
Give me all the details.
Absolutely.
Shiraishi believed that UFOs roamed around this lake.
There are no fish here and at times you can see strange ripples on the water.
Professor, what is that?
Let's move!
Earthlings... We do not want of an unnecessary war.
We want to talk to the following 5 people only:
Kenjo Adachi, Masao Noda, Tsutomu
Koda, Joji Atsumi et Nobu Kawanami.
How do they know us?
We have been invited, let us go in.
Wait, once you are inside, there is nothing we can do to protect you.
Well, too bad. We must go see them.
But ...
- Let us go.
Do you guarantee their well being?
Yes. Please do come in.
Inform HQ
-Yarr matie !
Hello, Hello.  1st battalion reporting here.
Yes ... Yes. We are ready to engage if needed.
It will be cold inside; please take a coat.
Please, have a seat.
It is a great honor to receive
Earth's greatest scientists.
Maybe, but we aren't very happy about being summoned here.
To avoid war, you will have to make some small concessions.
What small concessions?
As you are aware, we have been attacked since we've first arrived.
We have shown you our might, so we can avoid any other conflict.
Where do you come from?
We come from the planet that
Ryoichi Shiraishi has called Mysteroido.
If such a planet has ever existed, it exploded some thousands of years ago.
Yes. It was because we Mysterians started a nuclear war.
But some of us fled the planet in time to take refuge on Mars.
On Mars ?
Of course. You all 5 people know that Science is without limits.
These people want war. We hope that you will dissuade them.
We have had the H bomb while
Earth was still in the stone age.
If Earth decides to use the H bomb, so shall we.
And the Earth will be totally destroyed.
What is your reason to come to Earth?
Haven't you launched satellites?
Don't you want to conquer the Moon and then conquer Mars?
We haven't got such grand ambitions.
We only request a zone of 3 kilometers around this base.
We also want to breed with
Earth women.
Because of all the Strontium-90,
80% of our babies are born deformed.
To save our race, we need to cross breed.
To start with, we want these 5 women.
We already have 3 of them.
That's insane! You weirdos want us to GIVE you our women?
We are actually a peace loving people.
This ends this meeting.
We now rely entirely on you to make the right decision.
They are asking for a 3km zone which they already have gained by force.
They also request to mate with Earth girls, but they have abducted 3 of them already.
Although they are stronger than us, we have to show them we can fight.
Start the military operations.
The Army is on alert and deploying in great urgency.
Combat units are regrouping around
Mount Fuji.
After attending an important conference
Professor Adachi talks to the press.
We must all face something that concerns us all, humans.
Our decision was taken, after long talks and deliberations.
That is all for the day.
Welcome !
Welcome.
Have you seen the news?
Do you know what is happening?
It's the Mysterians, they want to breed with our women.
Oh my god ...
- Oh, no ...
There is worse.
You have been chosen.
Don't joke with these things!
- I'm not joking at all.
You are under the protection of the police.
Joji ...
They must have obtained a picture of the festival.
That is correct.
Look, on the television !
You !
As you can see, I am still alive.
Atsumi, I know that the Army will attack at 22:00.  Make them stop.
As a scientist, you must do it.
Are the Mysterians forcing you to say that?
No. I'm doing this for Earth.
Are 3 km too much to ask for?
You work for them ?
After having met them, I now know that our scientists are no match for them.
Nothing can compare to their technology.
I'm speaking to you from a TV set just to show you their superiority.
Don't start a war you have already lost.
If you want to contact me, just turn on your TV.  At any time.
Brother !
...instead Space isn't empty but inhabited by superior races.
Let us put our differences aside and face this menace together.
Shiraishi is with the Mysterians.
And how do you know that?
I have seen him on out TV set.
- On your TV set?!
He begged me to stop the attack.
I can't believe that. Not one bit...
- But ...
Everything is ready !
- Perfect !
Ready for transmission !
- Ready for transmission.
Spy plane now at coordinates: 137 °
47' east, 35 ° 35' north.
Open fire !
- Open fire !
Pull back ! Now !
According to our technical staff this ray of theirs is a gamma ray of 10,000 renkens.
It's an energy of level 10
In short, their ray has the power of the great Kanto earthquake.
That much ?
-Absolutely.
People of Earth ...
People of Earth ...
The Mysterians do not want war.
We are only defending ourselves and we will stop when the threat stops.
We simply request a 3 km zone around our location.
We hope that the governments will grant us that.
The Mysterians only want one thing, peace on Earth.
We have been utterly defeated.
So, what is done now ?
We are studying the results of our attack
Has anything been found?
-No, nothing at the time.
Teko, give me a report on our ground forces..
-Yes, chief.
Take a look at this.
A Supersonic Atomic Heat Ray Cannon ?
- One of my teams is working on it.
Whether they like or not, the USA and the USSR live on the same planet.
What is happening to Japan can happen tomorrow to the USA or the USSR.
I'm sure that all the people on Earth will get united against the Mysterians...
... Failing to do so, will be the end of our human race.
If the Mysterians gain ground on
Earth, others will arrive.
Have they travelled that far for just 3 km?
Let me show you my plan.
When will this be ready?
We need 500 of your Earth's hours.
500 hours ?
When the subterranean complex is finished, the shore will be ours.
In Arizona, the USA have launched a satellite to spy on the Mysterians.
We hope to gather important informations.
Do you know Ryoichi Shiraishi?
Yes, I have met him in Geneva.
At the International Space
Conference, right?
Yes, that's right.
Would you like to talk to him?
Can we do that?
- Yes.
Lots of things can come out of my hat, like...
Oh! It's you !
Greetings!
You must be fearing for you life.
I'm a scientist. The Mysterians want to prevent the destruction of Earth.
What do you mean by that ?
That the human race will blow itself up in 20 years from now. in 20 years ?
20 years! It's the time it took on Mysteroido.
The Earth cannot stay under the control of the humans.
Control the world? It's what humans do with animals
Our space station is 42,000 km above our heads.
The flying saucers can reach New York
London, Moscow, Tokyo in one instant.
The Mysterians have complete control over Earth's skies.
Who is controlling Earth now?
You or the Mysterians?
No, it's Science that rules now.
But we have to fight ...
We haven't got any other choice.
We must study the Mysterians's weaknesses.
For instance, the dome's ray...
It can't aim high into the sky.
According to Pr Adachi, the Mysterians cannot stand hot temperatures.
Let's stay focus on these points and apply that to our heat cannon.
Yes. I'll inform the general immediately. Good.
So ? Are they watching us ?
What do you think they're doing ?
It's only the beginning.
They bet on an easy war.
Without weapons, what can we do against them?
It looks like ...
...the Earth forces !
-Cover your eyes  !
No flying saucers in sight.
We believe their ray loses half of it's power above 3,000 metres.
Airship Beta, airship Beta, this is captain Sugimoto.
Initiate the attack at 3,000...
Initiate the attack at 3,000...
Roger, roger.
Engage the enemy !
Start dropping the bombs !
Are you hurt ? Hang on !
Airship Beta, airship Beta.
Continue the attack !
Temperatures of 3000 degrees Celsius have no effect !
What is this dome made of?
Airship Alpha, airship Alpha. HQ here.
Abort mission and return to base.
Abort mission.
Maybe there is really nothing we can do against the Mysterians.
It's coming from right underneath!
General.
Have you heard HQ ?
General, unless we can bounce their ray, things will get very bad.
Is the electronic heat gun ready?
Yes.  The only problem is to mount it on an airship.
Please hurry up, the entire world is depending on it.
Yes, general.
We now occupy a 120 km zone.
This is a warning. Any earthling that will come in will be killed.
The situation requires it, we can't avoid the possible use of nuclear weapons.
Kawakita, we can't allow ourselves to do that.
What happened to the Mysterians might happen to us.
Please look at this! It's a new weapon.
A Markalite ?
To sum it up, it's a 200m wide Atomic
Heat Ray Reflector.
That's a hell of a thing! It can store the ray and send it back to the enemy.
From its center, it will send a ray of the same power back at the Mysterians.
It's range is of one and a half km.
So we must built it close to where the enemy is then?
Won't they destroy it before we're thru building it?
Of course!... How can we do then?
We must have an other meeting.
Can't we mount this thing on airship
Alpha?
Yes.  It could neutralise the Mysterians
Heat ray.
I shall organize a technical meeting.
- Good.
Is there a problem ?
-No, no, nothing at all.
Hiroko ? Hiroko ?
Hiroko ?
Crap !
- Don't shoot !
Etsuko !
Report back !
- Yes chief !
Based on the recent UFO activity, the Mysterians must be closing in on their goals.
We just can't wait.  If the heat ray cannon is not ready, then let's use the Markalite.
But the Markalite won't last for more than
7 hours.  We must also use the ray cannon.
No.  Even if the damages aren't important it will delay them long enough.
We shall attack. Do your best to finish the heat ray cannon in time.
Yes.
We must evacuate the 120 km zone right away.
I hate to have to sacrifice Etsuko and Hiroko.
But we can't save them now.
We can't stop everything just for them both.
In the valley, a tunnel opened right under my feet.
The Mysterians might be strong, but they can't stop a man alone!
And I'm not afraid !
But I can't stop the attack.
Yes ? Ah ?
The Markalite will be deployed ?
It's ready to be moved to mount Fuji?
Thank you very much.
Atsumi !
Drop it !
First unit is working fine.
Everything is nominal.
The Earth women, where are they?
NO!
All of you, come with me please!
Now !
The Markalite is weakening.
20 minutes left.
Airship Beta, take-off.
Airship Beta, take-off.
Here is airship Beta, here is airship Beta.
The heat ray cannon is not ready yet.
Cease fire immediately or else we shall strike back.
Very well, but you must leave our planet first.
Airship Beta ! Airship Beta !
Only 5 minutes left.
Here is airship Beta, here is airship Beta.
We are taking off.
Hurry up and get out of here.
Ryoichi !
Brother !
Stand back ! I'm not coming with you.
Shiraishi !
Don't say anything.
Take that to Professor Adachi, it's the second part of my report.
My paper on Mysteroido is now finished.
Ryoichi !
Shiraishi !
Very soon their base will be built.
Then they shall destroy Tokyo.
The Mysterians have betrayed me.
I still have things to do here.
Goodbye.
Ryoichi !
- Shiraishi !
Hurry up and get out!
There is going to be a big firework!
The Earth must be told about the sad story of the Mysterians.
We must reject hate and learn to love!
The Earth must not repeat the same mistakes the Mysterians did.
Look ! Come with me !
Airship Beta here, airship Beta here.
We have entered the combat zone.
One minute left.
Get ready to fire.
- Get ready to fire !
Target in sight !
- Target in sight !
Fire !
Fire !
We must retreat to the space station!
Fire !
Target in sight !
- Target in sight !
Fire !
They shall wander in space for all eternity.
What is that?
It must be their satellite.
I believe that the Earth will hear again about the Mysterians.
This is Operation Experiment.
A secret base far north of the Arctic Circle.
Experiment was the code name for this top-priority scientific expedition.
These men arrived here on X-day minus 60.
It has taken them the full two months to get ready.
Today is X-day.
It is now H-hour minus 59 minutes.
There is less than an hour left.
The plane must arrive at its rendezvous
200 miles away in exactly 58 minutes.
There can be no margin for error.
There can be no second chance.
This is the rendezvous. The forward observation post where scientists... and their aides double-check equipment and wait for the plane's approach.
It is now H-hour minus 81 seconds.
At H-hour minus 75 seconds, the radar antenna flashes the word.
There it is! Azimuth: 63 degrees.
Airplane sighted: 13 hours, 11 minutes.
Azimuth: 63 degrees.
Speed: Approximately 350 miles per hour.
Professor Tom Nesbitt and Col. John Evans, military liaison, tensely wait.
The timing is perfect, thus far.
It is now H-hour minus 56 seconds.
Every man here knows his job.
He does it quickly, efficiently, silently.
The men are ready. The equipment is ready.
It is now H-hour minus 52 seconds.
Operation Experiment to Y-3-4-7.
Operation Experiment to Y-3-4-7. Over.
Y-3-4-7 to Operation Experiment.
Now leveling off.
Ground speed: 360. Approaching IP.
IP means initial point.
The next 26 seconds will determine whether these men have succeeded or failed.
Now we count the seconds.
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six... five, four, three, two, one.
Charlie, look!
Col. Evans, there's something strange on the radar screen.
- What's the matter, Charlie?
- Right here, sir. A foreign object.
- It's gone.
- What's gone?
- I don't know, sir.
- It silhouetted like 500 tons, at least.
- Where is it, then?
- I don't know, sir.
- Are you sure we saw it?
- We saw something.
Maybe the shock tossed something in front of the antenna. That must have been it.
Eight weeks of preparation, and it's all over in a second.
Jack, when energy of that magnitude is released, it's never over.
What the cumulative effects of these atomic explosions and tests will be...
- ...only time can tell.
- You mean scientists can't tell?
The world's been here for millions of years.
Man's been walking upright for a comparatively short time.
Mentally, we're still crawling.
This test will add to our knowledge.
Wouldn't you say so, Ritchie?
That's right.
Every time one of these goes off...
I feel we're helping to write the first chapter of a new Genesis.
Let's hope we don't find ourselves writing the last chapter of the old one.
- You sound like a man who's scared, Tom.
- What makes you think I'm not?
Here are the figures, Tom.
We'll leave for the observation post in about an hour.
- Good. Loomis?
- Yes, sir?
- Get the equipment ready.
- Yes, sir.
You gentlemen. The moment your Geiger counters indicate heavy radiation, turn back.
Turn back? Colonel, we'll run back.
There isn't a hero in the crowd.
Post 16.
Shall we try to go around, sir?
No, wait here for us. We'll go up on foot.
- What's your reading?
- 19.7. We'd better get out.
I'll check post 17. You take 18, and I'll meet you back here.
Make it fast.
Sgt. Willistead.
What?
But they've gone on foot.
Okay.
What's the matter?
There's a blizzard coming up!
Tom!
Tom! Tom!
Tom!
Tom!
Tom, I can't move.
Something's wrong with my leg.
I'm coming down.
- Have they reported back yet?
- No, not yet. We're waiting.
Tom, Tom! Get out, Tom! A monster!
- A prehistoric monster!
- Quiet, quiet. Don't struggle.
I'll get you out, George. Don't worry.
Doc! Hey, doc!
Put him right over here.
- Give me my bag.
- Yes, sir.
And get some blankets off those other beds.
How is he?
- Where's Professor Ritchie?
- Still missing, sir.
- What happened?
- We don't know.
We saw the flares and rushed to post 18.
The whole shore was breaking loose.
- We grabbed Nesbitt just in time.
- We never found Ritchie.
Colonel, we have to get Nesbitt to a hospital in the States.
- He's in a bad way.
- Right.
Get word to the main base.
We want a plane right away.
Ritchie, I'll get you out.
I'll get you out.
The monster... Hurry, it's coming!
Watch out, the monster! The monster!
Hello, Professor Nesbitt.
How do you feel today?
Fine. Where is Col. Evans?
Did you reach Col. Evans?
He'll be here any minute now.
I'd like you to meet Dr. Ingersol.
He wants to ask you a few questions, if you don't think it would be too hard on you.
- Questions?
- I'm a psychiatrist, Professor Nesbitt.
I thought together we might get to the bottom of this.
You think I'm crazy too.
My story may sound fantastic, but...
Throughout history, people have claimed that they've seen monsters.
There was the famous Loch Lomond monster, you'll probably recall.
Then the green serpents off the shores of Ireland.
But not one of them was ever caught or even photographed.
I'm not inclined to let my imagination run away with me. I'm a scientist.
All right.
Then it shouldn't be inconceivable to you... that the mind can withstand just so much pressure.
The shock of seeing your friend dead, your own predicament... was too much to bear. So that you momentarily lost contact with reality.
It's a phenomenon which was not uncommon during the war.
But Ritchie wasn't dead when
I got to him. He tried to warn me.
Two people don't share the same hallucination.
Hello, Tom. How are you?
- Thawed out?
- Jack, I'm glad you're here.
I'm having a hard time convincing them that I'm not an idiot.
I was in Washington making my report.
I was...
What did they say about the animal? I want to be in on any expedition going after him.
Tom, I didn't tell them about the animal.
Why not? It should've been in the report.
I went back to Post 18. I tried to reconstruct what happened out there.
I couldn't find a thing.
No tracks. Nothing.
Nothing?
I'm sorry. I wish
I could say I saw something.
The blizzard.
There was a blizzard, remember?
The snow must have blown over and covered everything.
- Check me out of here.
- You are in no condition to leave.
It's imperative that you have rest.
- How can I rest?
- I've encountered this sort of thing before.
You've undergone a tremendous shock.
You've got to stay in bed.
I see. And that makes it official?
I'm afraid it does.
So long. You do what the doctor says. We'll get together when you're on your feet.
That won't be too long.
What about that sound I heard?
In your condition, it could have been anything. The wind. Anything.
No wind ever made a sound like that.
Captain. Captain!
Are you daft, man?
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
What's going on in our turbulent world today?
Oh, death and politics. The comic page is the only thing that makes sense anymore.
I take it, then, that you advise a dose of it after each meal?
- You quote me exactly.
- Then I'm gonna take your advice exactly.
Here it is.
Say.
Look at this!
That item is right where it belongs.
On the comic page.
And that's why I came here, Dr. Elson.
I felt if you heard my story, you'd do something.
And what is it you think I can do?
Fit out an expedition, institute a search.
The fitting out of an expedition requires a great deal of attention to detail.
Such as time, personnel, money.
How can you talk about details in the face of such a discovery?
I'm not a paleontologist, and I have a desire to know more about this animal.
I thought you'd have such a compelling curiosity... that nothing would stand in your way.
Professor Nesbitt, after waiting for 30 years...
I'm about to undertake my first extended holiday.
I would throw aside my plans if I thought there was... the slightest chance of what your saying being possible. It isn't.
What about that newspaper item?
If all the items of seamen reporting monsters were placed end on end... it'd reach to the moon, my boy.
You mean, I'm wasting your time?
Do you realize you're asking me to believe... you saw a creature that would be over 100 million years old?
But you said that 100 million years ago, the water of the Mesozoic age turned to ice.
Isn't it possible that an animal was trapped in that ice?
Caught in the freezing temperatures and locked in.
Then when we released the bomb, the heat generated melted the ice... in which this beast was imprisoned and freed it?
Bringing it back to life after 100 million years?
Couldn't it have been in a state of hibernation?
Bears live through winters under similar conditions.
That's quite true.
A bear does live off itself for one winter from food accumulated within itself... but it's hard to believe an animal could live for 100 million years off its own tissue.
To put it mildly, it would require quite an appetite, don't you think?
I don't know if this will be of any help, but you remember, doctor... a few years ago, an expedition unearthed a herd of mastodons in the Siberian tundra.
Dead thousands of years, yet their fur was still intact, the meat still edible.
That's quite right, my dear Lee.
But they weren't alive.
That's the important difference.
They weren't alive.
I'm sorry, professor, but in all honesty,
I can't support your story.
I guess I'll go back to the hospital.
Maybe I should ask for a transfer to the psychopathic ward.
Nonsense.
It's not as bad as all that, my boy.
Thanks for listening, doctor.
When he first came to this country,
I attended his lectures... on the curative properties of the radioactive isotope. He is a brilliant man.
Isn't his story in any way feasible?
No. And I'm sorry.
I'd rather like to help him.
I thought that little jaunt of yours last week would knock you for a loop.
I can't find anything wrong with you.
I feel fine.
When do you think I can leave?
Any time's all right with us.
Don't go rushing to the North Pole again.
Keep fit and warm.
Take those vitamins I gave you.
This is your hour of mirth and melody.
They say music has charms to soothe the savage beast.
They ought to try it on these sea monsters.
From Canada comes word of a second ship... destroyed by an enormous beast according to Captain LeMay.
He really ought to stop smoking that stuff and try Virginia Golds, because...
It shouldn't take me too long to catch up.
- It's good to have you back.
- Thank you.
Anything else, Miss Ryan?
Oh, yes. There's Miss Lee Hunter waiting to see you.
- Miss Lee Hunter?
- She's very pretty.
Send her in.
- How are you?
- Fine.
We met at the university.
I'm Dr. Elson's assistant.
Oh, yes, of course.
The verdict: A prehistoric animal would be presumptuous to be alive today... and upset your neatly cataloged theories.
I see you don't remember
I was a sympathetic bystander.
Oh, really? How come?
I have a deep, abiding faith in the work of scientists. Otherwise I wouldn't be one.
- Won't you sit down?
- Thank you.
Sorry I can't offer you anything, but everything around here is radioactive.
No, thank you, anyway.
When I was in the lab yesterday...
I heard a report about a man who claimed that his ship was sunk by a sea monster.
"If all the stories about sea monsters were laid end to end, they'd reach the moon."
But two reports coming so close together...
What makes you think two are going to convince anybody any more than one did?
Well, it convinced me.
It got me to thinking it would be worthwhile investigating.
I've gathered all the sketches of the known prehistoric animals. If you could identify...
Being considered crazy has been quite an experience.
However, I wouldn't care to go through it again.
Is this the man with the compelling curiosity? Afraid of ridicule?
- I'm not afraid of ridicule.
- No?
But I'm afraid that's what it sounds like.
You said sketches of all the known animals?
What if it's an unknown one?
That's possible.
But we'll never really know unless you look at them.
Oh, professor, think what it would mean if you were right.
Five-minute break. It's coffee time.
Good. I need it.
Cream and sugar?
Better take both. I make coffee strong enough to enter the Olympics.
- One or two?
- Two, please.
I never knew there were so many prehistoric animals.
We haven't even reached the Cretaceous Period yet.
I don't know if I could identify the beast now if it looked through the window.
Maybe it's part imagination, after all.
Something I used to dream about when I was a kid. Or read in fairy tales.
You're tired. Why don't you just relax for a moment. Have a sandwich.
Thanks.
- Funny.
- What's funny?
Well, a girl like you, a paleontologist.
What's wrong with paleontology?
- Classifying old bones.
- Old bones?!
If we didn't study the past, you wouldn't know about the atom.
Dr. Elson says, "Future is the reflection of the past."
You're fond of Dr. Elson, aren't you?
How did you become his assistant?
I suppose by continually antagonizing him.
I was one of his students.
To hear him tell it, all I ever did was challenge him or argue with him.
I was afraid he was going to expel me.
Instead, he asked me to be his assistant after I graduated.
So I graduated, and here I am.
And here I am.
Between us, we span the ages.
You deal with the past, I with the future.
How uncomplicated the past was.
And how bright the future can be.
Let's get back to the present.
This might be it.
I'm not sure.
Not sure?
The head looks similar, but the front legs are too short.
Wait a minute.
Is this any better?
Now, that's much more like it.
And what about this one?
That's the closest!
I think that is it.
Lee, I think that's the one I saw!
If two independent observers saw the same thing...
If that captain in Canada could identify the same sketch...
And tell his story to Dr. Elson.
"Capt. George LeMay, Marquette, Canada."
- Operator.
- I want to make a long-distance call, please.
Person-to-person.
To Capt. George LeMay, Marquette, Canada.
One moment, please.
- Charge this call to Circle 44771.
- Thank you.
It's my monster.
They're speaking French.
- Capt. LeMay is ready.
- Thank you.
Hello. Capt. LeMay?
My name is Tom Nesbitt.
I'm a scientist in New York.
I have some important questions to ask you.
I don't speak English.
Captain?
- Hello. Capt. LeMay?
- I am sorry, but the captain has hung up.
He is unhappy when anybody mentions his accident, because everyone laughs.
Please get the captain back.
I can't tell you how important this is.
I am sorry. He will not speak to you again, I'm sure.
He is a stubborn old man. Perhaps a little crazy. Especially on the subject of serpents.
They think he is crazy too.
- Well, it was a good try anyway.
- But good tries don't pay off.
Do you suppose if you went up there... you could make him understand how important this is?
I could get a plane.
Phone me if anything exciting happens.
I'll phone you even if nothing happens.
You missed him by not more than two hours.
I thought you might be able to tell me where he went. His housekeeper wouldn't.
Capt. LeMay has been very touchy since the sea serpent incident.
People felt he was a bit balmy.
They laughed at him. Too bad too.
The man had served well and faithfully for years.
I believe a man has a right to a few nips now and then, I always say.
- You don't believe his story?
- I said he was balmy, not me.
He let it get out that he was headed for the interior of Canada... and was not going to stop until he hit a spot that was uninhabited by white men.
A blooming hermit he wants to be.
He'll be back in less than a month.
I can't wait that long.
- Were there any other survivors?
- No.
- How far is it to St. Pierre?
- About 100 miles.
Are you going to see this other chap who claims he saw it?
I say, you don't believe in the sea serpent fable, do you?
What do you think I am, balmy?
Good evening, Jacob.
You look much better today.
A man is here.
A very great scientist from New York.
No, Sister. Take him away.
I want no one near me.
He went to so much trouble to find you.
Why?
He says it is very important.
It's about the beast you saw.
Tell him to leave me alone!
Tell him I saw nothing!
Tell him I know nothing!
Tell him it's all in my head!
That's what everybody says.
Except me, Jacob.
- Who are you?
- I saw the beast too.
You saw him?
- You're not playing jokes on me?
- No, I'm not playing any jokes.
People called me crazy too.
It stays in my mind always.
I'll never forget it.
In New York, there are scientists, friends of mine, who will listen and believe.
Jacob, will you come to New York with me?
- Is he well enough to travel?
- I will ask the doctor.
There's something very compensating in having to wait 30 years for a holiday.
Because when it finally comes... the joy of anticipation is multiplied by just that many years.
I feel like a schoolboy on the verge of departing for my first summer camp.
Oh, by the way, that reminds me, our young nuclear physicist appears to be delayed.
He'll be here any minute.
Shouldn't take him long from the airport.
Mesozoic animal alive today.
I can lose my job and my reputation listening to such nonsense.
However, I won't allow my personal opinion to interfere with a possible romance.
Don't change the subject.
You're just being stubborn.
Am I?
Now, just you listen to this.
It's something that I read this morning.
"On the 21 st of October, in the year 1797, one Professor Gordon Laughton... was forcibly removed, by order of the Crown... from his chair of science at the University of Edinburgh.
He was firmly convinced that leprechauns were responsible... for the uprooting of the ancient campus oak.
Even swearing upon oath that he had seen them remove it."
So, you see, today, it's monsters instead of leprechauns.
How certain are you there were no leprechauns?
Hello, Lee.
I don't recall this Dr. Laughton, but what about Galileo?
He said the earth was round.
They made him recant.
However, the earth is round. And there is a monster. And I think I can convince you.
- Is this your sailor witness?
- Yes, sir.
Jacob Bowman, the helmsman of the fishing boat Fortune. Dr. Elson, Miss Hunter.
- So you saw the monster too?
- Yes, sir.
Go ahead, my dear.
This is your experiment.
Jacob, I want you to look through those sketches and pick out the one you saw.
You don't think this is a waste of time?
Several days ago at Miss Hunter's apartment...
I picked out the sketch of the beast
I saw. It's right in that batch.
But, unfortunately, in paleontology, the empirical system of logic isn't enough.
It isn't a question of empirics.
If a particle of the sun broke off and flew into space...
I wouldn't consider the man who brought that news to be insane.
As a scientist, I would examine every facet of it.
Yes, but if a particle of the sun were to break off, 100 million people would see it.
If it broke off, it would make no difference if one saw it or no one at all.
It would still be.
The same with the monster. It still is.
Perhaps I'm getting old.
Now, Jacob, you must be quite sure about this creature you claim to have seen.
There must be no doubt in your mind.
If it's here, I'll know it.
- That.
- That's the one I picked.
It's the rhedosaurus, extinct for 100 million years.
- A hundred million years?
- Yes.
And the direct ancestor of that little lady there.
Only twice the size, according to theory.
The only fossils of its species ever discovered... were found in a drag of the Hudson submarine canyons.
A hundred and fifty miles from New York.
Didn't Professor Edmonds write a paper on that just last year?
Yes.
Yes.
If we could only be sure, without a shadow of a doubt...
What further proof do you need?
Things have happened again and again, and they'll continue.
I tried to get the authorities to keep the coastline under close watch...
- ...they wouldn't listen to me.
- They'll listen this time.
Get them on the phone. I'll talk to them.
Thanks.
Col. Evans, please.
Jack.
Tom Nesbitt.
I feel great.
That hallucination of mine... the one that everybody was having such a good laugh about?
Well, I've got proof the monster exists.
Now, Tom, let's not start that again.
What?
I can just see myself requesting permission to seek out a prehistoric monster.
Eagles on a straitjacket are not regulation uniform.
I'm here at the university with Dr. Elson, the foremost paleontologist in the world.
Just a moment. He wants to talk to you.
Col. Evans. This is Dr. Elson.
I'm convinced that Professor Nesbitt is onto something.
There have been all kinds of stories.
Stories of sea serpents... stories of the world coming to an end, stories of flying saucers.
What makes you so sure there are no flying saucers?
Nevertheless, I'm convinced that by some strange trick of chance, this creature exists.
And I'm prepared to stake my reputation on it.
I'm sure you know what you're talking about, doctor... but it would look foolish if we stick our neck out.
Will you promise if any reports come in, you'll let us know?
I've got a friend in the Coast Guard.
I'll drop in to see him.
If he's heard of anything,
I'll get in touch with you. Okay?
Thank you, colonel. We'll appreciate it.
He's going to check and let us know.
- We can't just sit around.
- I'm afraid there's nothing else we can do.
But wait.
I heard a new song at the tavern the other day.
Something about gin and wild women.
- How'd it go?
- Oh, I don't remember.
I stuck five nickels in the box to hear it again... and the thing busted down.
You know me, I couldn't carry a tune in a bushel basket.
I like the ballads. The old ones that warm you even when the fog is a foot thick.
Did you hear that?
Come in.
That's all.
- Jack, how are you?
- Phil, at this moment, I don't know.
Well, sit down. Sit down.
I haven't seen you since the last Army-Navy game.
What a game that was.
What's the problem? AEC getting you down?
- No, not at all.
- Good.
Stick around. I'll be through in a minute. We'll go to the club.
Phil, here it is straight.
One of the scientists in the last polar test claims he saw a monster.
The dean of the College of Natural History believes him.
Then who am I to doubt it? Are you trying to get a Section 8 discharge?
A neurotic colonel.
These scientists claim that this monster or beast, this prehistoric thing... and if you laugh, I'll brain you, is romping around the North Atlantic.
I guess you'll have to brain me.
You're nuts!
Anyway, that's what they say.
Look, Phil. Would you do me a favor?
Check around to see if there have been any reports of any freak or unusual happenings.
- Are you on the level?
- If standing on my head's on the level, I am.
You certainly sound serious.
All right, I'll check. But so help me, if this is a practical joke...
I'll die laughing.
Well, that's it.
No storm, no earthquake, nothing... but that lighthouse was destroyed completely.
Were there any other unexplained happenings?
Yes. Coast Guard station 37 reported minor shore wreckage... along the Massachusetts coast.
Several isolated buildings were destroyed.
And a farmer was found crushed to death.
There's a certain inexorable chronology in these disasters.
I don't follow you, doctor.
Tom first saw the rhedosaurus near Baffin Bay.
While his latest presumed presence was off the coast of Massachusetts.
- May I look at your chart, captain?
- Of course.
Now, first... north of Baffin Bay.
Second, the fishing ketch Fortune was wrecked here... off the Grand Banks.
And another one attacked shortly thereafter.
Here. Nova Scotia.
Third, the lighthouse off the coast of Maine.
Fourth, unexplained wreckage off the coast of Massachusetts.
You'll notice we've been following the Arctic Current all the way down.
So it's just possible that he might be making for here.
It was in these submerged canyons that the only fossils of his species were found.
We could mine those canyons.
And kill the rhedosaurus? Oh, no.
Think what a loss to science that would be. Oh, no.
But to capture it alive would be an achievement.
How do you propose to capture it, if it exists?
I don't know. But if we ascertain it's down there in the canyons...
I'll have to go see it before I decide upon a method of capture.
That's much too dangerous.
Yes, but then the risk would be worth it when one thinks of the benefit to science.
Captain, is it possible to obtain the use of a diving bell?
- You really want to go down there?
- Yes.
I can get a diving bell.
What do you think, Jack?
Everything else checks out.
If he can get it, let's move.
Thank you.
I still don't see how he's gonna find it.
This canyon is 100 miles long.
As I understand it, he plans to drop down at a different spot every hour till he finds it.
Hear this. Hear this. We are now ready to make the dive at position number one.
I don't like the idea of you going with just one man.
That's capacity. If there's any danger, my crewman will know what to do.
- I brought your Dramamine.
- No, thank you.
I'm much too excited to get seasick.
Are you ready, Dr. Elson?
Remember, at the first sign of danger, signal us.
Why will you persist in talking about danger?
The rhedosaurus and I are old friends.
- Good luck, doctor.
- Thank you.
- Here you are, sir.
- Thank you.
Don't look so worried, Lee.
We're scientists.
This is our job.
This is a great moment for me.
Everything shipshape in there?
Splendid, thank you.
All the comforts of home. Lower away.
Hoist away.
Is there anything I have to do?
Oh, no, sir.
You just relax and enjoy the scenery.
This is such a strange feeling.
I feel I am leaving a world of untold tomorrows... for a world of countless yesterdays.
Lee was right. I should have brought the Dramamine pills.
This is all very frustrating. I do hope all our endeavors are not going to be in vain.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome, doctor.
We are having coffee now.
And some visitors.
There appears to be a difference of opinion between two of the local inhabitants.
There he is!
It's unbelievable.
He's tremendous.
I can only see part of him... the leg and the shoulder, but he is enormous.
He found it. Shall we pull you up?
No! No! No, put Lee on.
He wants to talk to you.
Yes, doctor.
Lee, there's no mistake about it.
It's a Paleolithic survival.
It's exactly as we pictured it except the dorsal is singular, not bilateral.
The clavicle suspension appears to be cantileveric.
But the most astonishing thing about it is...
He doesn't answer.
- Get him up.
- Raise the bell.
We're pulling you up! Dr. Elson!
Can you hear me? Answer me!
The line is dead.
Well, the report has been turned in.
The National Guard and Coast Guard have been alerted. Evans is in charge.
This was being packed for a very different reason.
What can I say?
I should have gone down instead of him.
I am to blame.
Nobody is to blame.
And everybody is to blame.
We all did what we thought was right.
But that doesn't bring him through the door again.
With his funny little walk, and that wonderful smile.
This place seems so empty.
He used to putter around with the specimens and call them pet names.
His death was so futile.
He went down in that bell because it was part of his job.
He used those same words just before...
Oh, Tom.
It's coming up Nassau Street toward Pine.
Get some help fast!
New York is like a city besieged.
A state of emergency has been declared... and the entire police force put on 24-hour duty.
Civilian defense is fully mobilized... and shelters have been opened in an effort to stop the mounting hysteria.
All traffic has been halted.
And Times Square, the heart of New York, has stopped beating.
The National Guard has been called out, fully armed, to repel the invader.
This is full-scale war against a terrible enemy... such as modern man has never before faced.
Ordinary bullets have no effect... and a method of destroying the awesome creature has not yet been formulated.
But the battlefield has been cleared.
Herald Square.
34th Street.
Broadway.
Every section of the city is guarded.
No one knows where the monster will strike next.
It was last seen on Wall Street, close to where it came ashore.
But lower Manhattan has become no man's land... where the beast, at present, lies hidden.
The National Guard is barricading the area... in an effort to confine the death and destruction... of what is already the worst disaster in New York's history.
A screen here.
105 temperature.
Here's the blood specimen.
Get it to the laboratory quickly.
I'm afraid, Sam.
I am afraid of what that creature has brought to us. Deadly afraid.
- Think you can place it between his eyes?
- We can try, sir.
- Fire when ready, corporal.
- Yes, sir.
His skull... it's at least 8 inches thick.
- Another one, colonel?
- No.
It would take a 3-inch shell to penetrate that skull.
Bazooka squad, prepare to fire.
The high-voltage wires, it's gonna touch them!
Bazooka men, fire!
Under the neck, when he raises his head again.
Get those emergency search lights on!
We're working on it.
Sergeant. Sergeant!
- What is it?
- Blood.
Give me the walkie-talkie.
Col. Evans. Col. Evans?
Sgt. Wyntoni.
Now, look, proceed with extreme caution.
Wounded, the animal might be twice as dangerous as before.
There's a possibility the animal might've headed for the river.
We'll have all shore batteries alerted and naval patrol vessels.
Get me a command car!
- Col. Evans speaking, go ahead.
- Look, colonel... something's funny.
Most of the detail, they're...
Well, they're out.
Out on their feet, sir.
Have your sergeant contact the medics.
And report to Capt. Mitchell.
Your car is ready, sir.
Have the medical officer report to me at area command.
Yes, sir.
He is reported somewhere in the lower bay area.
- Battery A in position zero.
- Battery A into position zero.
- Report radar findings.
- Report radar finding.
Sounding harbor bottom.
Sounding harbor bottom.
- Activate mines, numbers 8 to 24.
- Activate mines, numbers 8 to 24.
What's the situation, major?
We're sounding the harbor bottom.
No indications yet, sir.
Charting room. Col. Evans?
Majors, there's a call here for Col. Evans.
This is Evans speaking. Who?
Oh, yes. Hello, doctor.
Colonel, they've already brought in over 50 of your men and the people this afternoon.
The monster's a giant germ-carrier of a horrible, virulent disease.
Contact with the animal's blood can be fatal.
If you use shell-fire, who knows how far the air will spread the particles of it.
- The entire city can be endangered.
- Right, doctor.
- Have the anti-submarine nets been raised?
- No, sir.
Order them raised.
- Raise the anti-submarine nets.
- Raise the anti-submarine nets.
Flamethrowers would've cremated the beast and the plague with it.
Flamethrowers? The smoke would have carried the blood particles just as far.
No, it will have to be reduced so that not even a cinder would remain.
Any reports yet, major?
No signs yet, colonel.
He may be dying at the bottom.
We'll set the drags in the morning.
Attention! Monster ashore at Manhattan
Beach, heading towards amusement area.
- On land?
- I thought we had him in a corner pocket.
Jack, there's only one way to beat him.
How?
Radioactive isotope.
Shoot it into him and destroy all that diseased tissue.
Keep your men alerted.
But nobody's to fire unless ordered to.
Yes, sir.
How soon, Tom?
Should be any minute now.
Wait for us here.
- I'm Professor Nesbitt.
- We've got your baby, professor.
Good.
- We need your best marksman, Jack.
- Right.
Have him get into these.
Here's your man, Tom.
- Colonel says you need a dead shot, mister.
- Yes.
- Ever use a grenade rifle?
- Pick my teeth with it.
Good.
You know what a radioactive isotope is?
- No, but if it can be loaded, I can fire it.
- I'll load it.
Just remember one thing:
It has to be shot into the wound.
And you have to make it the first time.
This is the only isotope of its kind this side of Oak Ridge, so you can't miss.
Let's get to the target.
I can't hit him from here, mister.
- Ever ride one of those things?
- Yes, sir.
Jack! Get somebody over here who can operate that roller coaster!
We want to get to the top in one of those cars.
Right!
- Put your hood on.
- Yes, sir.
- Help us, Father, help us!
- What about some food?
- Father, they're starving us!
- Are you staying, Father?
This man is raving.
Are you sure you wish to see him on your own?
A visitor for you, Baron Frankenstein.
If you need any assistance,
I shall be outside.
They told me you wanted to see me.
Is it spiritual comfort you want? Is that it?
Keep your spiritual comfort for those who think they need it.
I sent for you because I could think of nobody else.
People trust you.
They listen to what you tell them.
Now listen to me, and when I've finished you can pass it on to them.
Then, perhaps, they'll believe me.
- I have to tell you...
- I have to tell you, you just listen!
I'm sorry. If you think my word will carry any authority, I'm afraid you are mistaken.
You'd better not tell me what you consider so important.
- You'll stay.
- Take your hands off me.
- Tell me you'll stay.
- Do you want me to call the guard?
I apologize. Please, sit down.
I said I apologize.
I'll not forget myself again.
As you wish.
Unless I can convince you...
...that what I'm about to tell you is the absolute truth...
...then in one hour from now
I shall be dead.
- I've told you...
- Then, perhaps, you'll understand.
Perhaps you'd better start from the beginning.
Where did it all begin?
I suppose it was when I was a boy at school.
I always had a brilliant intellect.
That fool who taught us may have been able to hoodwink the others...
...but what did he know?
He'd been teaching the same rubbish for 30 years...
...and I don't suppose he'd read a new book for 20 of those.
When my mother died,
I inherited the Frankenstein fortune.
This enabled me to begin the life and work
I had always planned for myself.
Victor, dear boy...
...you are the sole remaining member of the Frankenstein family.
I know you will conduct yourself...
...in a manner which would make your poor, dear mother proud of you.
I shall do my best, Uncle. Thank you.
Thank you all for coming.
Goodbye.
What was it you wished to see me about,
Aunt Sophie?
It is a matter of some delicacy, Victor. L...
Was it about the allowance my mother made you?
You needn't worry.
I shall continue to pay it.
You're a good boy, Victor.
Your poor mother would be proud...
- Yes, yes.
- Elizabeth, thank your cousin.
There's really no need.
Come along, Elizabeth.
Say thank you, nicely.
Thank you.
She's a good girl. She'll grow into a fine woman one day.
- I'm sure she will.
- And she'll make someone a good wife.
- Goodbye.
- Well, goodbye.
The first of the month, your mother used to...
- I understand. I shall do the same.
- Thank you.
Good morning.
Is this the home of the Frankenstein family?
It is.
I'm Paul Krempe. I have an appointment with Baron Frankenstein.
You must be Victor.
I'm going to be your tutor.
So I understand.
But surely it isn't settled yet.
I thought this was just an interview to decide...
...whether you were suitable for the position.
Yes, but I've had correspondence with the Baron...
...and he seemed satisfied with my qualifications.
That's right, he did, didn't he?
- I expect he wanted to see what I look like.
- That must have been it.
- Will you tell your father that I'm here?
- My father is dead.
- That's ridiculous. I had a letter...
- He's been dead for 10 years.
It was I who advertised for a tutor.
It was I who wrote to you.
You're the Baron then, are you?
And have been since I was 5 years old.
And you want a tutor for your son?
I thought it would save a lot of explanation by letter.
A difficult thing at the best of times.
I fail to see that the disclosure of the facts can make any difference.
You were to be engaged as my tutor, subject to the Baron's approval.
You will take up the position.
You will be paid as arranged.
By whom?
By the Baron. I'm quite rich.
Do you still want the position?
I should be honored, Herr Baron.
My first opinion of Paul
was soon confirmed.
He turned out to be an admirable tutor.
In two years I'd learned all he had to teach, but we went on together...
...probing into the unknown, investigating, recording, searching...
...always searching...
...until gradually the sweep of our research began to assume a single direction...
...and to this aim
we finally turned all our energies.
It took us years of unrelenting work to discover what we were seeking.
Then, one night...
...out of sight and sound of the rest of the house...
...our efforts were rewarded.
Paul, it's alive.
Paul, we've done it!
Paul, we've done it!
There was a lag between the cardiac reaction and the first visible signs of life.
That'll be the time required for the heart to circulate blood through the entire body.
If we could delay or prolong the period in which the body is apparently dead...
...while the heart is alive...
...we'd have a living body with only the barest life-spark present.
Think what that would mean when it came to performing major surgery!
We could save hundreds of lives.
Reducing shock to a minimum, no loss of blood.
Victor, the Medical Federation meets next month in Berne.
Can we have our paper ready?
We could.
- But we're not going to.
- Why not?
It doesn't meet again for a year.
Why wait that long?
We must wait.
What we've done up to now is nothing to what we will do.
We've only just started.
Just opened the door.
Now is the time to go through that door and find what lies beyond it.
Don't you see, Paul?
We've discovered the source of life itself...
...and have used it to restore a creature that was dead.
This is a tremendous discovery, but we mustn't share it yet.
We must move on to the next stage.
We've restored life where life was extinct.
It's no longer sufficient to bring the dead back to life.
We must create from the beginning.
We must build up our own creature...
...and build it up from nothing.
From what?
What on earth are you talking about?
Forget the whole.
Now we must take the parts...
...limbs, organs, and then we must build.
- Build what?
- The most complex thing known to man:
Man himself.
We must create a human being...
...with perfect physique, hands of an artist, and a matured brain of a genius.
- We can do it. Don't you see?
- No, I don't.
What you're saying is nonsense, a revolt against nature.
Such a thing could only end in evil.
Come, what's the matter with you?
You haven't shown any scruples up to now.
As for revolting against nature, haven't we done so already and succeeded?
Isn't the thing that's dead supposed to be dead for all time?
Yet we brought it back to life.
We hold in the palms of our hands secrets that have never been dreamed of.
Where nature puts up barriers to confine the scope of man, we've broken through!
- There's nothing to stop us now.
- What is it you want to do?
First we need the framework, the body.
Last week they hanged a man at Engelstadt, a highwayman.
He'd been terrifying the countryside for months. As a warning to others...
...his body has been left on a gibbet, just outside the town.
It'll hang there till it rots...
...or it's stolen.
The birds didn't waste much time, did they?
The eyes...
Half the head is eaten away.
What are you going to do?
Take the head off.
It's no use to me anyway.
It's in the acid.
A few minutes, and there'll be no trace.
Paul, give me a hand with his clothes, will you?
Look at those hands.
Great clodhopping things.
No wonder he was a robber.
With hands like those, he couldn't have been anything else.
Except, perhaps, a gorilla.
I don't think we should continue with this.
We should wait and present our findings at the Federation.
- Should anything go wrong...
- I've got it.
- What?
- Look after things while I'm gone.
Gone where?
If I leave tonight,
I should get back by tomorrow evening.
- Victor!
- Yes, Paul, what is it?
What are you talking about?
Where are you going?
Going?
I'm going away for a little while.
I'll tell you about it when I get back.
Better not touch our friend here while I'm gone. Let him rest in peace...
...while he can.
Let's have some food, I'm hungry.
I thought it was the master.
No, he hasn't come back yet, Justine.
Will he be in time for dinner, sir?
I don't know, he didn't say.
There he is now, sir.
Good evening, Baron Frankenstein is expecting me. May I come in?
I shall need some assistance with my luggage.
- Luggage?
- Yes, I'm coming to stay.
Well, I'm sorry, miss, but the Baron told no one of this.
But he must have done.
I wrote him some weeks ago.
Victor, how happy I am to see you.
I'm afraid there's some mistake.
Mistake?
Didn't you get my letter?
I'm not Victor, I'm Paul Krempe.
Oh, Paul Krempe. I'm so sorry.
- I haven't seen Victor for so long.
- Now that you know who I am...
...why not tell me who you are?
I'm Elizabeth, Victor's cousin.
Didn't he tell you about me?
No, he did not.
For which he will be severely reprimanded when he returns.
- Oh, he's away?
- He's expected back at any moment.
We shan't have long to wait.
Are you going to stay with us long?
I'm coming to live here.
- This is to be my home.
- Live here? But...
Paul, I...
Elizabeth.
Victor.
Elizabeth.
I received your letter.
I was so sorry to hear about your mother.
How are you, my dear?
The maid will show you to your room.
Paul, come see what I've got.
Elizabeth, we'll see you at dinner.
- Yes, but...
- Paul, come on.
As he said, we will see you at dinner.
Lock the door, Paul.
Come and look at these.
What about these?
Have you ever seen anything so beautiful?
Bardello's hands.
The hands of the world's greatest sculptor.
Where did you get them?
Leipzig. I heard that Bardello died there last week.
- All it needed was a little bribery.
- You realize what this means?
It means that our friend will have the finest hands any man ever possessed.
I mean your cousin's arrival.
We can't continue with this experiment.
Not here, anyway.
- What are you talking about?
- Elizabeth. She might find out.
What if she does? Where's the harm?
She's young, Victor.
Her mind would be incapable of receiving such a shock.
All right! You can't see the horror of what you're doing.
At first I was blind to it.
And now?
While you were away, I decided
I could not continue with this experiment.
I hope I can convince you I'm right, change your mind, too.
You'll never do that, Paul.
In six months, you'll rejoice in the fact...
...you helped make this discovery.
You'll be as famous as I.
No, Victor. Infamous!
I will not help you, not anymore.
I beseech you.
Give this up, if not for your own sake, for the sake of the girl.
You're wasting your time, Paul.
Help me graft these hands on.
I want to see if they take.
Can't you understand?
I will not help you anymore.
And I shall try to make Elizabeth leave here.
Elizabeth won't leave, Paul.
If you're really not going to help me,
I'd be glad if you'd leave me alone.
I have work to do.
I shan't be down for dinner.
Make my excuses to Elizabeth, will you?
- Will you require anything else?
- No, thank you, that will be all.
Very well, sir.
I shall take the master's dinner up now.
Leave it outside the door.
Of course, Herr Krempe, I always do.
Do you take your coffee black or white, Paul?
Elizabeth, I don't know you very well, but I want you to do something for me.
Yes?
Leave here.
Leave?
Leave this house at once, and never come back.
That's impossible. Why do you ask it?
I can't explain, but it will not be safe here.
Not safe?
Victor will be here, won't he?
- Oh, yes. Victor will be here.
- Then I fail to see...
It's because of Victor that I'm asking you to leave.
He's conducting experiments which could be very dangerous.
What sort of experiments?
- You wouldn't understand.
- I would understand, I'm sure.
Please, tell me.
Believe me, I can't tell you,
I would if I could.
Then I shall have to ask Victor.
If I'm to marry him, then I have a right to know.
Marry?
Of course, we're engaged.
Didn't he tell you?
How can you be engaged to someone you don't even know?
It was an arrangement between Victor and my mother.
That's absurd. You can't be expected to honor an arrangement of that sort.
My mother and I were entirely dependent upon Victor.
We'd have starved without him.
Now, perhaps, you understand.
I understand you're confusing gratitude with affection.
You have no right to speak to me like that.
How dare you!
I'm sorry. It's entirely your own affair and nothing to do with me.
I still think you should leave.
Believe me, it's for your own good.
Really, Paul, I can't imagine why you make this idiotic request.
It is not a request.
It's a demand. You must not stay here.
Perhaps we should let Victor decide that.
After all, it is his house.
Or had you forgotten?
No, I haven't forgotten.
I'm sorry. Perhaps I shouldn't have spoken to you like this.
I'm sorry, too.
I lost my temper. Please, forgive me.
Really, Paul...
...just because it was arranged years ago...
...that's no reason for my not marrying Victor.
It has always been my dearest wish.
His, too.
Victor...
- How many times have I told you?
- Baron, then.
- Herr Baron.
- That's better.
How much longer is this to go on?
Meeting like this in dark corridors.
Making love in secret.
When are you going to marry me?
What makes you so sure that I'll marry you?
Because you promised.
And because of this.
Herr Baron Victor...
...this woman...
...what is she doing here?
- Are you jealous?
- No.
Yes.
Yes, I am jealous.
She's not your mistress?
- Lf I thought she was...
- On the contrary, Justine.
She's to be your mistress.
It will be your duty to serve my cousin Elizabeth.
And see to her every need as thoroughly as you have mine.
- In a different way of course.
- Of course.
Victor, you're not going away again, are you?
I'm afraid I must.
I'll be back tomorrow evening.
Why, Elizabeth...
...what's the matter?
I'm disappointed.
I see so little of you these days.
And there are the household accounts.
You should check them with me.
They'll soon be your department, and I'm sure you'll handle them well.
But I'd like you to see them.
I'd like your assistance with them.
Soon you'll be asking to help me with my experiments.
But I would. I'd like that more than anything in the world.
Who knows, my dear, perhaps you will.
One day.
I have to go. I have some materials to buy.
Materials for my work.
Well?
- Here you are, sir.
- Careful, man.
Not often we get them perfect in here, sir.
Eyes are generally the first to go.
What do you think, sir?
They'll do.
Ten we said, didn't we?
- Each.
- The pair.
The pair. Just like you said.
- Who is it?
- Paul.
I'm just coming.
Come in, Paul.
You wanted to see me?
It's been a long time since you've been up here. Why is that?
- You know you're always welcome.
- I told you I would not help you.
In that case, why do you continue to live here?
Of course, it's Elizabeth you're worried about, isn't it?
What is it you want?
Haven't you found it difficult keeping away...
...just guessing what I was doing?
Never knowing how well I was getting on?
I've decided to let you see my progress.
Then you can judge for yourself whether I shall succeed or not.
I'm at the last stage but one, come and see.
- What do you think?
- It's horrible!
Paul, the features are not important.
What matters is I'm creating a being that will live and breathe.
Once the scars on the face heal, it won't look so bad.
Victor, I appeal to you.
Stop what you're doing before it's too late.
What am I doing?
I'm harming nobody.
Just robbing a few graves.
What doctor or scientist doesn't?
How else can we learn the complexities of the human animal?
Doctors rob for the eventual good of mankind.
This can never end in anything but evil.
Why do you say that?
I admit he isn't a particularly good-Iooking specimen at present.
One's facial character is built up by what lies behind it...
...in the brain.
A benevolent mind, and the face assumes the patterns of benevolence.
An evil mind, then an evil face. For this...
...the brain of a genius will be used.
When that brain starts to function within the frame...
...then the face and features will assume wisdom and understanding.
I told you I was at the last stage but one: The brain.
A brain of superior intellect.
A lifetime of knowledge already behind it.
Imagine that.
My creature will be born with a lifetime of knowledge.
Where is this brain to come from?
I'll get it.
- Now, Professor.
- Lhr or dir.
Your hospitality is too generous, my dear Baron.
On the contrary, Professor Bernstein, it is we who are in your debt.
When Victor told me you could come,
I was overjoyed.
You honor me, Miss Elizabeth.
Not only overjoyed because you were to stay with us, but because...
...your presence at dinner tonight would ensure my Victor's presence.
Elizabeth thinks I spend too much time in my laboratory.
He's locked in there for hours, Professor.
He doesn't eat and he doesn't sleep.
I, for one, think the world would be a far better place without research.
At least, my world would be.
She may be right, Baron.
One can spend too much of one's life locked in stuffy rooms...
...seeking out obscure truths.
Searching, researching...
...until one is too old to enjoy life.
Victor, the Professor is on my side.
You've failed me, Professor.
Elizabeth will be quoting you when she wants me to leave my work...
...and idle away the time with her.
Indeed, you shall.
I'll say, "Victor, you are only a little scientist. I shan't listen to you.
"On the authority of the greatest brain in Europe, leave your laboratory...
"...and come out into the sunshine with me."
Women, Professor. How cleverly they twist our words to suit their own ends.
She'll only be happy if I give up my work entirely.
Is the world ready for the revelation you scientists make?
There's a great difference between knowing a thing is so...
...and knowing how to use that knowledge for the good of mankind.
The trouble with us scientists is...
...we quickly tire of our discoveries.
We hand them over to people who are not ready for them...
...while we go off again into the darkness of ignorance...
...searching for other discoveries...
...which will be mishandled in the same way when the time comes.
It's not as bad as that, surely.
Would you have us give up research, too?
Good evening.
Paul, I'm so glad you arrived in time to meet Professor Bernstein.
Professor Bernstein?
Yes, indeed.
May I introduce my friend Paul Krempe.
- Good evening, sir.
- How do you do?
The Professor is staying with us tonight.
I'm proud to meet you. I had no idea such an honor awaited my return.
We didn't expect you until the morning.
I thought it best to come back.
I've heard a great deal about you from Baron Frankenstein.
I look forward to a talk with you in the morning.
I shall be delighted.
- We've exhausted the Professor.
- No, no.
I have enjoyed every minute of this delightful evening.
But old age comes not alone.
Good night, young lady.
Good night, Professor.
I trust that you will sleep well.
- Good night, sir.
- Good night.
- I'll show you to your room.
- Thank you.
I really am most honored to have you here, sir.
I'm most grateful to you, my boy.
You know, I'm alone in the world.
And to be guest in someone's home, especially...
...such a charming home like this with such a wonderful atmosphere...
...it's very precious to me.
You are too kind, sir.
I'd like to show you a painting just before you retire.
It's this one at the top of the staircase.
It was purchased by my father and illustrates one of the early operations.
If you step back a little, you'll see it better.
Look out, Professor! Look out!
Baron Frankenstein...
...I'm sure I'm expressing the feelings of all of us...
...when I say how much we appreciate your kindness and consideration...
...in allowing the body of our poor colleague...
...to find its last resting place in your family vault.
As you know,
Professor Bernstein had no living relatives.
It was the least I could do.
He was a guest in my house.
I thought I'd find you here.
That was very intelligent of you.
Now that you've found me, what do you want?
You killed the old man, didn't you?
And now you're mutilating his body.
Mutilating? I've removed his brain.
Mutilating has nothing to do with it.
I can't prove you murdered him, but I can stop you using his brain.
Why? He has no further use for it.
- Give me that!
- Don't be a fool! Be careful!
You'll damage it!
Get away from here, leave me alone!
Get out of here!
If you've damaged it...
Who is it?
What's the matter, Paul?
I've come to appeal to you to leave here.
- What are you talking about? Leave here?
- Now.
This very minute. Before it's too late.
Paul, we've been through all this before.
Won't you understand you're in real danger?
What Victor is doing is dangerous to everyone.
Then why do you stay here?
You're not helping him any longer.
I'll tell you why I stay here.
I will not leave you alone in this house with him.
Believe me, Paul. You're wrong about him.
Am I?
- You must be.
- How do you know?
Have you ever been in that laboratory of his? No.
You cannot possibly conceive the dreadful thing he's proposing to do.
What are you trying to tell me?
That Victor is wicked, insane?
Neither wicked nor insane.
Just so dedicated to his work...
...he can't see the terrible consequences that could result.
Elizabeth...
...I can't bear the thought of any harm to you.
I'd do anything to avoid hurt to you both, but...
...Victor is so wrapped up in his experiments...
Paul, please.
Please, leave me.
I want you to help me.
You must be mad.
That apparatus was constructed for dual operation. You know that.
I thought I could work it myself, but I can't.
I'm delighted.
That means your experiment will not succeed.
You're going to help me, Paul, whatever you say.
If you help me, once I've proved my theories, I'll dispose of this creature.
- How long will that take?
- A month, two at the outside.
And have that thing alive up there? No!
If you don't help me, Paul, then I make no such promise.
Somehow, I'll manage on my own.
However difficult, I'll do it.
And when I have succeeded...
...I'll introduce Elizabeth to science and see how she likes it.
There is nothing more important to me than the success of this experiment.
It's what I've worked for all my life.
All right, Victor.
I'll help you.
Victor!
I did it, Paul.
This thing must be destroyed before it regains consciousness.
Do you hear me, Victor?
- What did you say?
- You must destroy this thing now.
Don't you see? I've succeeded!
Yes, nearly succeeded in getting yourself killed.
- Another 10 seconds and you...
- This is my creation.
Yes, a criminal lunatic. It tried to kill you...
That's the brain.
When you attacked me, it was damaged.
That makes it your fault, Paul.
Your fault that it is not what I intended it to be.
I can repair the brain.
It's what I've done that counts.
I've created a being.
- You promised to destroy it.
- When I've carried out my research.
- Don't you see you've created a monster?
- That doesn't matter.
I shall operate on the brain tomorrow.
It shouldn't take long.
Very well, Victor. Goodbye.
Paul! Paul!
- Paul, he's gone!
- He's what?
I've searched the house.
Heaven knows where he's got to.
It's true, Paul, we must get out and find him!
- I'll go to the village for help.
- No, I'll send word.
We must pick up his trail.
If he gets into the woods, we'll never find him.
I'll meet you downstairs.
Hold on, boy.
You're going too fast for your old grandpa.
You sit here then, Grandpa.
- Where?
- Here.
I'll go on now. It's not far.
Aye, thank you, boy.
- Do be careful, now. Go on.
- Yes, Grandpa.
That was quick.
You can't have picked many.
What's the matter?
Can't you find your way?
I'm here, son.
I've lost my stick. Help me find it, son.
You're quiet. Cat got your tongue?
Who are you?
Tell me who you are.
What do you want with me?
Can't you see I'm only a poor blind man?
I've got nothing for you.
I can't harm you.
Somebody help me! Help me!
Grandpa!
Grandpa!
Look, he must have stopped here.
Where did you tell the villagers to make for?
The south lakeshore. I said we'd meet them there in half an hour.
Well, his trail is easy to follow anyway.
No, Paul!
- You shoot well.
- I've done what had to be done.
- We'll bury him before the villagers arrive.
- They won't arrive.
I didn't send the message.
You madman!
You risked just two of us against that?
- We might've been killed!
- We might. But we weren't.
Now he's dead, so it doesn't matter.
Well, it's done and I hope you're satisfied.
I'm satisfied we were in time to stop this monstrous act before it was too late.
If that's what you mean.
I don't think I shall ever forgive you for what you've done. Ever.
- Who's there?
- It's me. Paul.
Just a minute.
- Well?
- I'm leaving now.
- I shall send for my things in a few days.
- As you wish, Paul.
- Where are you going? What will you do?
- I have no idea.
It is no longer necessary for me to remain here.
What do you mean "necessary"?
Of course, there's Elizabeth.
You stayed to protect her.
You've done what you set out to do.
You can leave with a clear conscience.
I'll give you life again.
- Justine, you can serve dinner.
- Just a minute.
Is it true?
I beg you pardon?
About you marrying that woman?
- Aren't you forgetting yourself?
- You promised to marry me.
I'm not forgetting that.
- So I did.
- Don't you laugh at me.
- Stop it! Stop it or l...
- What?
- What will you do?
- I'll kill you.
You stupid little fool!
- Did you really think I'd marry you?
- You're hurting!
Get back to your work!
But you've got to marry me. You've got to.
I'm going to have a child.
- Since when is this?
- It doesn't matter.
It's true, that's all.
Why choose me as the father?
Pick any man in the village.
The chances are it'll be the right one.
She won't think so. Not when I tell her.
I'll tell her about what you're doing in that laboratory of yours.
And then I'll go to the authorities and tell them.
Tell them what?
I know plenty, if I care to tell.
- What do you know?
- You wouldn't like that, would you?
Well, if you don't marry me, I'll tell.
Tell what?
You know what I'm talking about.
Proof, my dear. That's all the authorities would be interested in.
Proof.
- I want you out by tomorrow morning.
- I'll get proof.
Just you see. I'll get it.
Pass the marmalade, will you, Miss Elizabeth?
Thank you.
Victor?
I'm worried about Justine.
It's a week since she went away, and we still have no word from her.
I told you not to worry.
I expect some village lothario eloped with her.
She always was a romantic little thing.
How are the wedding invitations coming along?
- Had any replies yet?
- Yes, quite a few.
- Victor.
- Yes, my sweet?
I've invited Paul to the wedding. After all, he was your good friend.
I'm sorry if I've done wrongly.
He hasn't accepted yet, so...
...maybe he won't come.
I hope he does come.
There's something I'd like him to see.
To the bride and bridegroom.
To the happy couple.
To the bridesmaids.
- What are you gibbering about?
- I was just rehearsing my speech, my dear.
That's not until tomorrow, after the wedding.
Yes, I know, my dear, but these things take time.
Come on. We're going home.
So soon?
Come on.
Thank heavens they're gone.
I have work to do upstairs.
But this is our wedding eve. I thought...
Oh, come, Elizabeth.
We are not sentimental young lovers.
Can I come and watch you working in your laboratory?
No, my dear. Not yet.
But one day very soon.
I promise you.
It's a pity Paul didn't come.
Leave those for the morning, Ellen.
Yes, Miss Elizabeth.
Good evening. I'm Herr Krempe.
Are the Baron and Miss Elizabeth at home?
- Yes.
- Paul!
- Paul, how marvelous to see you!
- Elizabeth!
- We thought you weren't coming.
- You look wonderful!
- And Victor?
- He is in his laboratory.
He's been almost living there for the past few weeks.
- What's he doing?
- As if I should know.
I'll never know what goes on behind that locked laboratory door.
Of course, I forgot.
He'll be pleased to see you, because he said yesterday...
...that he wished you were here because he has something he wants you to see.
- Has he?
- Why don't you go and surprise him?
I will.
- Who's there?
- Paul.
Paul?
Paul.
Still keeping the door locked.
Is that necessary?
You can judge for yourself in a moment.
Elizabeth said you had something to show me.
Yes.
Yes, Paul, I have.
I've started on brain surgery, Paul.
Nothing to say?
- So it wasn't killed.
- Oh, it was.
At least, life had passed from its body.
But don't forget...
...I put it there in the first place.
It was easy to restore.
Wait, Paul.
I want to show you something else.
- I've seen enough.
- Wait, Paul!
Watch this.
Get up!
Come on, get up!
That's right.
Now come here.
Come on now.
Come here!
Sit.
Sit down.
Sit down!
Is this your creature of superior intellect?
Your perfect physical being, this animal!
Ask it a question of advanced physics.
It's got a brain with a lifetime of knowledge, it should find it simple.
Shall I tell you something, Paul?
There you see the result of your handiwork as much as mine.
Oh, yes. I gave him life.
I put a brain in his head.
I chose a good brain, a brilliant one.
But you damaged it.
You put a bullet in the wretched thing.
This is your fault, Paul.
Do you understand that?
Your fault.
Yes, I understand.
But you won't win, Paul.
Shall I tell you why you won't win?
Because I shall carry on.
If I can't cure it by brain surgery, then I'll get another brain.
And another. And another.
No. No, you will not.
Paul, what are you going to do?
Paul, what are you going to do?
For your sake, and to protect Elizabeth,
I've so far kept silent.
Now I shall go to the authorities and have them destroy that creature.
- And see that you pay for these atrocities.
- No!
Paul, where are you going?
Paul, wait a minute!
What are you going to gain by this?
- You're as much a part of it as I.
- I've had nothing to do with it for months.
I've got something to say.
Who's there?
I warn you: If you tell the authorities,
Elizabeth will be the first to suffer.
Victor! On the roof.
- We must go up there.
- Not this time, I'm going for help.
Elizabeth! Come back!
Get back! Get back!
No! No!
Get away from me!
My life's work destroyed.
Destroyed in a moment.
By the same hand that gave it life.
Within half an hour there was nothing left of him.
And that is my story.
That is what happened.
You don't believe me, do you?
You must believe me. Do you hear?
A visitor for you, Frankenstein:
Herr Krempe. Will you see him?
Oh, yes! I knew Paul wouldn't fail me.
He'll tell you it's true. He knows.
He'll tell you it's true!
All right, he'll see you.
I knew Paul wouldn't fail me.
He's been a good friend.
He'll prove everything I said is true.
He knows.
My dear friend, Paul!
Paul!
Paul, my friend, tell them, Paul.
- Tell them what, Victor?
- About him. About the creature I made.
Tell them. You were the only person to see him apart from myself and Justine.
The girl you murdered.
But I didn't. That's what I've been saying.
It was him.
- He did it.
- Who?
- Who did it, Victor?
- The creature I made.
You know. The man. Tell them.
Oh, no! No, Paul!
Paul, you must tell them.
You know what's going to happen.
Only you can save me.
You must tell them.
Paul, I'll make you! I'll make you!
Paul, you must tell them! Paul!
You must tell them. Paul!
I'm sorry, Paul, but you must tell them.
You must save me, Paul.
You've got to save me!
No!
Paul!
There is nothing we can do for him now.
Come on, I'll take you home.
Subtitles ripped by
PECKATSWE
Sorry, this is restricted territory.
- I seem to be lost...
- Where do you want to go?
I left Phoenix, made a side trip to Lobos City.
I got off this road.
Haven't seen a sign for 40 miles.
Right here is where you made your wrong turn.
Who are you?
What are you doing here?
You have no business here.
How'd you get past the guard?
Dr. Eliot...
This guy broke in.
I couldn't help it.
He conked me.
Are you all right?
- Better call the hospital.
- Better call the morgue.
- What happened to him?
- Looks like a heart attack.
Take him out of here.
Sure, Doc, sure.
Atta girl, Susie.
I knew you'd come through.
What are you doing here in the salt mines?
Didn't you and Vera have a date to go to the movies?
Leaving right away.
I just dropped in to check on M47.
Here the data on M47's orbit.
Susie just finished the job.
Come on, Arnie.
Take a look.
There.
Like I always say, after you've seen one asteroid you've seen them all.
Sure, to you she's just a set of intercorrelated coordinates, what fun is that?
She's a beauty all right.
Have you named her yet?
I don't think I know her well enough to call her by name.
After all, I haven't even computed her ecliptic yet.
Great Scott!
What's the matter?
That thing is changing its course.
It looks the same to me.
You haven't been watching it as long as I have.
The orbit shows a slight perturbation, but it could be a grav pull from the moon.
No, I doubt it.
I set the exposure meter at 10 minute intervals.
Maybe we got enough photos to make a fix.
- Is there anyone in the darkroom?
- Yeah, Vera is, of course.
Let's get down there, right away!
- How we doing, Vera?
- Here there are, Les.
What do you make of it, Arnie?
Looks like a good 15 degree shift to me.
It's a little out of my line, Les.
But Susie can give us the straight dope, with no guess work.
Yeah...
Let's run a double check before we take these to Dr. Eliot.
Get 'em dried off and bring them right upstairs.
There goes our movie.
Aw...chin up, Vera.
The movie was probably a dog anyway.
Right, Susie?
Susie gets a lot more attention than I do.
Susie's going into her differential phase.
- I never get tired of watching her.
- Neither do I.
- But why Susie?
- Very simple.
Synchro Unifying Sinometric
Integrating Equitensor.
Put 'em all together, they spell Susie.
Well, it won't be long now, Les.
Everything points to the same conclusion.
Spectroscopic shift to the violet plotting coordinates...
- Having trouble, Dr. Culver?
- I can't figure it out.
The interlace and the diode loop went right out of sync for no reason.
I'm sure you'll be able to find it [??].
Dr. Eliot, we've run on something you'll be interested in..
Input level okay.
Feedback negligible.
Cathode checks.
Susie, speak to me!
Seems like your girlfriend's getting temperamental.
Very interesting, Gaskell.
If your assumption turns out to be justified.
It's more than an assumption, Dr. Eliot.
Oh, of course.
Pardon the unfortunate choice of word.
Let me know if you find out anything more about the new orbit.
- I can't figure him out.
- He didn't seem to believe you at all.
Les, I'm stumped. It may be an all night job before I find the bug.
Anything we can do?
Nah, it's gonna take lots of work to get Susie back in shape.
Look, why don't you two go on to the show.
All right. Might as well.
See you latter
Come on, Les. If we hurry, we'll just make the feature.
Yeah, oh sure.
That's the starter button, right there on the dash.
I should have phoned Professor Winter at Palomar or Burns at Harvard.
Oh, Les!
Well, we'll want verification from other observatories anyway.
That's the only thing that'll ever convince Eliot I'm right.
Here we go again!
I better go back and see what Arnie doing.
Besides, there probably will be more film to develop any minute.
I don't know when I've enjoyed a movie so much.
I'm sorry, honey.
I don't understand you, Les.
You've never been so tense about a planetoid before.
Well, M47 is my baby!
Naturally I worry about her when she's ailing.
I know you better than that.
Something else is on your mind.
Yeah, that swing out of orbit...
...not normal.
When I saw it I got a kind of chill.
- It's weird!
- Very scientific.
Oh, I have my unscientific moments.
Would you be having one now?
Maybe.
Say, you about through down there?
What?
Oh, yeah.
Susie's back on deck and rarin' to go!
Diameter: 4.9 miles.
Mass over 6000 megatons and speed of 1750 miles per second.
And destination: Earth.
We can only hope it burns itself out when it enters the atmosphere
With that mass, not a chance!
Perhaps you're right.
Perhaps I've underestimated both of you.
That's not important now, sir.
What is important is M47 will strike the Earth within 16 hours.
And it must not be permitted to strike at all.
- How can we prevent it?
- A job for the Army.
They've got the guided missiles, the nuclear warheads.
Intercept and destroy it before it strikes.
Standby to ready missiles.
Missiles ready.
Connect automatic radar tracking.
Missiles connected to tracking radar.
Standby to fire missiles.
Standing by.
All stations, at my signal the time will be X minus one minute.
All stations...
...at my signal the time will be X minus 20 seconds.
Repeat, X minus 20 seconds.
2, 1, fire!
I will now announce time to intercept.
- They found the target.
- The missiles are converging.
Guard your eyes.
... One, zero!
- What's happening, Les?
- Hard to say.
I think the missiles have done the trick.
- No, wait.
- What is it?
- What do you make of it, Arnie?
- It's not destroyed at all.
Those rockets carried enough explosive force to blow up all of New York.
They had no effect at all!
- Something's happening.
- What, what?
Get Eliot!
Les!
Failure of the atomic missiles to explode the asteroid is still an unexplained mystery.
General Miles reports other steps are being taken to cope with the emergency, but refuses to give details.
The atomic warheads seem to have had an effect on the object, however, causing it to veer in its course.
Unofficial estimates are that the asteroid will land somewhere on the North
American continent, but no two experts agree exactly where that will be.
Chances of the object striking a large city are remote.
The Mayor, the police commissioner of New York urge all the people to stay where they are, and not, I repeat, not give way to unfounded rumors.
The asteroid is heading in the general direction of New York, but it hoped that it will pass over without damage to the city.
That unusual sound you hear is being given off by the approaching asteroid.
Ladies and gentlemen, please stay tuned to this station.
We will try to keep on the air.
We understand that static from the asteroid is interfering.
We hope the danger will be over any second.
The people of North American breathed more easily today.
By providential chance, the giant body missed the heavy centers of population and plunged into the Pacific
- off the Mexican coast.
- Turn that thing off!
Many churches are holding special services of thanksgiving for the deliverance from...
Deliverance!
"Danger averted!"
What's the matter with them?
Can't they see any farther than their noses.
Several scientific institutions are already talking about plans to
- send expeditions to study it.
- Plans?!
Do you realise how long it takes a scientific expedition to get under way?!
- I think I do.
- Months!
Les, the asteroid will stay put.
How do we know it will?
- What are you talking about?
- Look, Arnie...
You and I saw M47 swerve in its path, take a course impossible to explain by natural physical laws
- Didn't we?
- Yes, we did.
Any mass ten times its size and density should have been pulverized by that atomic barrage, but it wasn't!
Instead, it changed its path again, struck downward towards the Earth.
Like a wounded animal lashing out at its tormentor.
- Well, what does all this add up to?
- What, Les?
Intelligence.
Now, don't laugh.
Maybe it's just a crazy hunch, but...
I got a feeling I'd like to go down there right now.
To Mexico?
What'll ya see?
I don't know.
Maybe nothing.
What about Eliot?
He'll have to give his approval, won't he?
Right now he's in no position to approve or disapprove!
- Oh, but Les...
- Look, Arnie...
What if it is an intelligent being of some sort from... somewhere out there?
Will it wait for our scientific expeditions to get under way 6 months, a year from now?
Or will it make a move of its own...
- before that?
- From under 2 miles of ocean?
Why not? It came through a billion miles of space.
You better turn back.
We're running short of gas.
[Speaking Spanish]
It is very good.
That Vera!
Packs our equipment and leaves out the chemicals!
Is this what you're referring to, Dr. Gaskell?
Vera!
How did you get down here?!
Took a plane to Mazatlan.
Hired a Jeep for the rest of the way.
Wow!
- You know what I mean.
- I thought you might need these.
If you hadn't been so careless.
Careless, like a fox.
I don't know what you're referring to, Dr. Culver?
Never mind.
Look, you must be hungry. They tell me this Mexican food is just wonderful.
[Speaking Spanish]
Water! Water!
Hurry, water!
Eighty-two.
I'll do it.
Yes...
...I understand.
Yes!
I...I'll do it.
Cigarette?
No, thanks.
Hey, Les...
Manuel wants us to go clam digging with him.
- How about it?
- Uh-uh.
Vera?
No, thanks.
I've already dug up a clam.
I'm sorry, Vera.
Well, I've had more thrilling dates.
Look, Vera, this thing is on my mind.
Well, there's not a thing you can do about it 'til morning.
Why don't you stop worrying and try to relax?
We'll go over the whole area again with a fine tooth comb...
- ...start out before dawn.
- And if you don't find anything?
At least we can get back to Labcentral before
Eliot learns what a fool I made of myself.
You know, somebody might think that you're disappointed in not finding some... horrible beast from another planet.
I can't get over the awful feeling that this is the calm... and that the storm is going to break out any minute.
I never looked at the night sky without an awareness that there's more out there than we can ever hope to understand.
Things we might sense if we weren't too stupid to admit their existence.
Doctor, look at this.
Sedative, Nurse.
It's having no effect.
Ask Dr. Williams to prepare the patient for shock treatment.
Yes, Doctor.
- Dr. Gaskell?
- Hmm?
- Will you marry me?
- Why, Miss Hunter!
- Can you cook?
- Cook? I wrote the book!
Sew?
I whipped this up all by myself.
Do you think you'll be able to respect a husband who's probably pulled the scientific boner of all time?
Les, look!
Les... Les, that thing!
Look at the size of it!
I knew it. I knew it.
This is a great improvement.
Electroshock therapy daily, until further orders.
Yes, Doctor.
Dr. Eliot, do you hear me?
Yes, yes!
I want you to rest, quietly.
You've been through quite a siege.
- Then it's true!
- Dr. Eliot!
It's not a dream.
It did happen!
You're not yourself, Doctor.
I'm myself for the first time since...
- How long is it since..?!
- Dr. Eliot, I must insist!
- Nurse!
- No, no, you've got to listen to me!
- What is it, Doctor?
- Call an orderly, hurry!
For God's sake, listen!
I don't know how much time I may have.
Please, let me explain.
You've got to help me.
Help me, Doctor.
That fog, you could cut it with a knife.
Occasionally, I get these lucid moments.
Yes, go on...
- Everything seems clear then?
- No
No, that's just it it's clear and it's not.
I know I'm doing something terribly wrong.
- During the periods you can't remember?
- Yes, but...
But I can't tell what it is.
I just know that... it's as if I'm not myself, but somebody else.
Someone evil and dangerous.
Someone who should not be allowed to live.
You have impulses to do away with yourself?
Not myself, but the other one.
This force inside me.
Have you ever tried to commit suicide, Dr. Eliot?
What good would it do?
He would live on... command the stars!
- What did you say?
- Command the...
You don't believe me, do you?
- Of course I do, Dr. Eliot.
- No, you don't.
Think I'm insane.
I'm not insane!
This is the truth.
This is what's happening.
You've got to believe me!
May 23rd.
The patient exhibits a marked paranoid syndrome, with manic-depressive effects.
The clinical picture is atypical, in that encephalogram readings are opposite to expected findings.
A patient's Alpha waves are violent during his lucid moments and read almost normal during his more violent seizures.
Electroshock therapy seems to bring on patient's fantasies, rather than to quiet them.
The patient is convinced he is possessed by a demon, an incubus which dominates his actions and makes him carry out its will.
Through this demon he is telepathic, dominating at a distance the inhabitants of some undisclosed world who subsist on pure electrical or atomic energy.
Finding their planet depleted, they are scourging the universe for fresh supplies.
Les, look!
My glasses! My glasses!
Les!
Jump, Vera!
May 24th.
Under continued shock treatment the patient's fantasy takes on more detail.
A great energy storehouse or to use the patient's word, accumulator has landed on this earth under the direction and control of his incubus.
Unless stopped some how, others will land and suck the Earth dry of all electrical and atomic energy resources.
Patient's cerebrospinal pressure has risen to 20 mm.
His blood chemistry shows an abnormal consumption of energy.
A thalamic examination shows marked abnormality.
Electroencephalogram... still atypical.
- Doctor?
- What are you doing up?
Give me that record.
But these recordings are private, you know that.
The things I told you must not be known.
You mean... you?!
Impossible!
Now you're the only one that knows, and you will never tell.
The strange monster is alleged to have appeared without warning at this isolated spot on the shore of the Pacific,
100 miles south of [??].
The story was phoned in from
Los Santos by Dr. Leslie Gaskell, the well known and reputable scientist from Labcentral.
He flew down to investigate the asteroid.
We've recorded Dr. Gaskell's report and here is a portion of it.
Thought we'd found an earthquake...
We saw it standing.
It's about 100 feet high, made of gleaming metal.
I can only think of the giant Kronos.
It hasn't moved, since.
It may not have dangerous intent, but certainly looks formidable.
As you can hear the telephone connection from Los Santos was very poor.
Dr. Gaskell's mention of the giant Kronos, refers to the great evil monster of that name from Greek mythology.
A good name for this modern Kronos.
Perhaps one that will catch on.
Here's an artist's conception, drawn after Dr. Gaskell's description.
Pretty scary looking, isn't it?
Perhaps a gift from another world to ours. Who knows?
Speaking of Labcentral, Dr. Hubbell Eliot,
Director of Labcentral, was discharged today from
Phoenix General Hospital, only a few hours after the tragic death of his attending physician,
Dr. Albert R. Stern.
The well known neuropsychiatrist was accidentally electrocuted in his own laboratory by a defective circuit.
Navarez Electro.
Navarez Electro.
Navarez Electro.
- There he is!
- That's the Navarez Electro plant.
Great Caesar's Ghost!
Military planes!
This is Captain Torres,
Mexican Air Force.
Evacuate area at once and do not approach military objective.
Give me the mic.
You're not thinking of attacking that thing are you?!
Discontinue radio, please, and evacuate military area.
I've never been down in the insulation chamber before.
There's nothing to be afraid of.
The Alpha chamber is lined with lead and titanium 4 feet thick.
It can withstand any cosmic ray known.
Fine!
- Who is?
- Gaskell.
Just a moment.
Dr. Eliot,
- did you give this interview?
- That's right.
They can't do it.
Don't you understand, they can't!
The Pentagon has given the green light.
Preparations are already underway.
You haven't seen that monster, Dr. eliot!
Are you suggesting that anything in this universe can withstand a multiple thermonuclear attack?
You yourself have generated the heat of a dozen suns in the nuclear furnace on the other side of that wall.
I tell you that Kronos has plates more impervious still.
Not only can he withstand any force we're able to throw against him, but he will actually absorb that energy.
- Become more powerful from it.
- Have you any proof of this, Gaskell?
No positive proof, but I'm convinced that the giant sucks up energy like a sponge, feeds on it, is a walking storehouse of energy!
And you propose to feed it the most concentrated dose of pure energy that man has ever been able to devise!
Why did he choose a power plant in the first place?
Who knows.
A boulder rolling down a mountain doesn't know or care what it destroys in its path.
You're falling into a trap, Doctor, if you think of this thing as blind, undirected.
Its very construction is proof of intelligence, of a degree of organization man may not realize on this earth for another thousand years.
If man is still around.
All right, Leslie.
What would you do to stop this thing?
- I don't know yet, but...
- See...
...you have no positive plan.
In the meantime, the giant is marching up the coast of Mexico.
It's turned inland.
We can not wait 'til it reaches populated territory.
We must hit it, now!
Les! Les!
Right, Arnie. Got it.
Just what I need.
Les, this something you should know.
The Phoenix Hospital just phoned and...
Dr. Eliot?
I'm sorry, I thought...
What were they telling at the hospital about me?
Why, nothing.
Nothing...
There's no need to lie. I know very well what they told you.
Les!
- Les!
- Hang on, Arnie.
Les!
Eliot!
Be careful, Les, he's a maniac!
Dr. Eliot...
Are you all right, Dr. Eliot?!
Listen.
I don't know how much time I have.
Gaskell, you must listen.
Gaskell,
Here on Earth we have learned only one half the nuclear secret.
We can transform matter into energy.
Up there, they have the other half.
They transmute energy into matter!
They have learned how to create the basic elements of matter.
Electrically and atomically.
You mean like the experiments Halard at Boston Tech has been conducting?
But their planet has become depleted of energy.
How can that be?
What has happened to them may well happen here, if we continue using our resources at the present rate.
Now they're sending down accumulators to find and store up new sources of energy.
Life's blood.
So that's how the giant grows.
- How can we ever stop it?
- I don't know.
Reverse the process, somehow.
Kronos... only the first.
If he succeeds, more will come, drain the Earth of energy, of every last bit of power.
The bomb...
Get me the Pentagon.
Well, clear the line!
This is an emergency!
I don't care if the plane is on its way.
Call it back!
That bomb must not go off!
Contact BX-89 and order him to return to base at once.
Yes, sir.
Ground Control to BX-89.
BX-89, you are to return to base.
Repeat, return to base immediately.
Am I reading you right?
You say...
You are reading me.
Return to base at once.
But we are in sight of objective!
You heard the order.
Return to your base at once.
Yes, sir.
BX -89, are you returning to base?
We're out of control.
The controls are frozen!
We are being pulled to the objective.
Control to BX-89.
Come in, BX-89.
All right, let's go over it once more.
Kronos was governed by a distant intelligence.
Somehow fastened on Dr. Eliot.
The records from the hospital all fall in line now.
Right!
Vera, run that tape again, will you?
Gaskell, you must listen.
Here on Earth we have learned only one half the nuclear secret.
We can transform matter into energy.
Up there, they have the other half.
They transform energy into matter.
Energy into matter.
Anthropic conversion!
How can we ever stop it?
I don't know.
Reverse the process, somehow.
Yes, but how?
How, in heaven's name?
Oh, come on, old girl.
I know I'm asking an awful lot.
Please don't go into a nervous breakdown.
Nervous breakdown?
Susie can stand just so much input, then her feedback circuit overloads and jams and she goes into a regular tizzy.
Wait...
Couldn't we do that to Kronos?
What do you mean?
Apply the Attenberg Theorem.
Destroy the monster with his own energy.
Set up a field of force...here!
A concentrated shower of
Omega particles.
Matter derived from energy, could cause change of polarity!
A reversal process would trigger the conversion.
Kronos power to destroy would be turned upon himself!
By setting up an internal chain reaction,
Kronos would become his own executioner.
Yes...
Yes, thank you.
I'll tell him.
- Think it'll work?
- It'll have to.
Kronos is headed for the atom bomb stockpile at Hueneme.
Once the news got out that Kronos was heading for Los Angeles it was impossible to prevent panic.
Police and National Guard have been powerless to stem the wild rush away from the doomed city.
Military authorities state that the city is in the monster's path on his way to the huge stockpile of nuclear weapons at Hueneme.
One more hope remains.
Dr. Leslie Gaskell of
Labcentral, at this moment, is closeted with officers at an air force base just outside Los Angeles while a lone jet plane wings in from
Boston Institute of Technology with rare radioactive elements on his order.
What Dr. Gaskell proposes to do, the world has no idea.
Nor, scientist that he is, will he make any firm predictions about an event hedged with so many unknowns.
If your plan fails, only the mountains can stop him.
- It can't fail.
- It won't. I know it won't.
Right!
We made radio contact with the jet.
We're switching controls to the control tower.
4J574 calling AFB144.
Can you pinpoint objective for me?
Objective is at 27 14 52 North.
175 18 07 West.
How soon can you make contact?
Urgent!
Contact within 4 minutes.
Report back when you sight objective.
Right!
4J574 calling AFB144.
Come in 4J574.
Objective sighted.
Dead ahead.
Hang on.
Get me Meteorology.
MT3.
MT3, pilot has made contact with objective. Take over.
Right.
MT3 to 4J574.
Go ahead, MT3.
Wind drift: 8 miles per hour and 160 degrees.
Approach target at 20,000 feet.
Air speed: 360 from 320 degrees.
- Fire 1 mile 7 tenths in advance of target.
- Check.
That wind better hold steady.
Just better hold steady.
Leveling up at 20,000.
Proceed.
Okay, [??], here I come.
MT3 to 4J574.
The wind has shifted. Cancel target run and circle for further instructions.
Got you.
Sergeant!
MT3 to 4J574.
Wind now at 195 degrees.
Drift: 6 mile per hour.
Approach 360 air speed at
20,000 from 15 degrees.
- Fire 1 mile 9 tenths in advance.
- Check.
Les, you've done it.
You've done it!
- Thank heaven.
- What'll happen now?
The chain reaction will keep on until the last stored electron of mass has been neutralized.
Kronos is literally eating himself up alive.
We're witnessing his death throes.
I can get back to Susie and you two can go to the movies.
Les, do you think they'll send any more down?
If they do, we'll be ready from them.
There it is, General.
It's your vindication.
Profit without honor, heh?
Well, at least I'm still alive to see this.
They'll break their necks to get you back when they see what this can do!
2...1...Fire!
Sweeney!
Stay in here!
There may be more explosions!
What happened, Charles?
What went wrong? - I don't know!
There couldn't have been anything wrong withe the design aeronautically.
No, it was the motor.
Why? Why after 4 years of development and tests?
It seems impossible but I can think of only one thing...-What?
Somebody tampered.
- Sabotage?
That's for intelligence to find out while we build another.
I'm afraid you won't, Charles.
- Of course we will!
Do you think this failure will make it easier to get new appropriations?
Things like this mean military cuts.
Research is going back to the laboratories. - Then I will too.
I'm not quiting!
First, I want to re-introduce myself to my wife and kids.
Mow the lawn, fix leaky faucets, paint fences and...
...read a few detective stories in the bathtub.
Then get on with the problem and a few others I've neglected.
A satellite to circle the Earth forever at 12,000 miles above sea level.
What did I call it just before it was fired?
Your vindication, General?
I'm sorry. I'm sorrier about that than anything else.
For your years of crusading all I've given you is...
...the most expensive pile of junk in history.
General Thayer is here, Mr. Barnes.
- Fine. Send him in.
Don't forget to wash behind your ears!
How was your trip, General?
- Very smooth.
I flew in on one of your Skyliners.
Nice ship, Jimmy. Very nice.
Whenever you start with a compliment, you're after something.
That's hardly civil, Jim.
I haven't seen you for 2 years.
Did I ask you for something the last time I saw you?
You certainly did!
You wanted a shoulder to cry on because Cargraves' rocket fizzled.
Glad to see you anyway.
I'm not wasting time crying about that anymore.
After the way you sold me...
Quote: "the rocket is an absolute necessity."
"If any other power gets one into space before we do...
...we'll no longer be the United States, we'll be the Disunited World, etc..."
It's twice as true today.
You proved that a satellite rocket isn't practical.
It blew up, didn't it?
Did it blow up, Jimmy?
Or was it blown up?
Blown up?
Why ask me?
Army Intelligence might know.
They know.
What's your pitch, General?
I'll tell you!
- Wait a minute...
I think I can put this together myself!
You're a satellite rocket man...
You crusaded yourself right out of the service and you kept on crusading.
Finally they took up the Cargraves project and it fizzled.
Now, following the course of old established habits...
...you'd like to drop it in my lap!
Well, I love you General...
...but I'm just a plain manufacturer, not the Dept. of Defense!
The answer is no!
Don't light that cigar, we're going to lunch!
Who said you're anything but a manufacturer? That's why I came to you.
Building rocket satellites is big stuff.
I couldn't begin to finance one....
I'm not asking you to rebuild the satellite.
Cargraves spent 4 years on that project!
That rocket could have and should have done everything we anticipated!
There's no time nor need to repeat that experiment.
Then what are you driving at now?
- The moon!
Okay, I'll listen.
Tell me.
I did tell you! The next rocket we build is going to the moon!
Let's go to lunch.
- I'm serious, Jim.
You can't be! It's too fantastic!
The Moon? Impossible!
Even with an atomic energy engine?
Exhaust velocity potential of 30,000 ft/sec?
A thrust of 3,000,000 pounds?
Why, even Gesputly's atomic engine has only limited use. He has no mobile unit.
Cargrave's has spent the last 2 years on it. He designed and tested it.
His scale model ran for an hour and 23 minutes before it blew up!
Incredible!
- I saw it, Jim.
And the government hasn't taken that over?
It's peacetime. The government isn't making that kind of appropriations.
They'll need to rocket one day and they'll turn to you!
To private industry. Government always does that when it gets in a jam!
This time, I figured we might be ready for the government!
Preparedness isn't all military, Jim.
What about the money?
That's not the problem!
It's production. That's why I came to you. You're a production man.
The problem right now is one of research.
Designing, special materials... the pooling of resources, specialized skills, engineering brains.... industrial capacity.
No single company could possibly do it.
But combined American industry sparked by Jim Barnes... could put a rocket on the moon within a year.
What do you say, Jim?
Do we go to lunch?
Or do we go to the moon?
The moon, huh?
Here's the control room.
All this space below carries the working fluid, the reaction mass.
Water heated to dry steam by the atomic pile and expelled by this jet.
Here we have the shielding to protect the crew from radioactivity.
Here are the gyros that can be used to turn the ship to any desired attitude.
I admit, gentlemen, that this enterprise appeals to me!
I've always been attracted by progressive forms of transportation!
I'm not known as a
"horse and buggy" man!
I'd like to have a finger in this new devil.
Though nothing would tempt me to ride in it.
But can we afford it?
I've been told you can, Mr. La Porte!
Now listen, I've known you from way back...
Two engine planes weren't fast enough; you had to go in for four.
Then props weren't fast enough; you had to go in for jets.
Now, you've got something else.
Something that will go higher and faster than anything before it.
You can't swing it alone, so you're trying to rope us in on it.
Before we go along with you, you'll have to tell us...what's the payoff?
Dollars and cents?
I don't know.
I want to do this job because it's never been done, because I don't know.
It's research, it's pioneering!
What's the moon?
Another North or South Pole?
Our nearest neighbor in the sky!
- But why go there, Jim?
We'll know when we get there.
We'll tell you when we get back!
It's a venture I don't want to be left out of.
I like our viewpoint, Jim. But there are those here who won't see it.
They don't even understand it!
I've got a first reader lesson for them.
Sit down will you fellows?
Gentlemen!
May I have your attention please?
If you'll be seated, I'd like to show you a movie prepared for this meeting.
We have one of Hollywood's best known actors to play for you!
Alright, Sam!
I'm a busy man.
Dragging me all the way here to talk about a rocket to the moon!
It's ridiculous!
Comic book stuff!
Comic book stuff, eh?
Life Magazine doesn't think so!
Nor Look, nor Pic, nor Collier's... nor your biggest daily newspapers!
It'll never get off the ground!
No propeller!
Rockets do not employ propellers.
They use jets.
So do gas stoves, but they don't fly to the moon.
Obviously, you know nothing about rockets.
Now, let's pretend that umbrella of yours is a shotgun.
Shoot it!
Who pushed me?
- The gun, Woody.
The charged not only fired out of the muzzle, it kicked back with equal force against the barrel.
It wouldn't happen again in a hundred times!
Shoot it at the ground a few times quickly and see what happens.
That same principle applies to rockets.
It is the same shotgun kick of the explosives... that throws the rocket forward.
That kick is independent of the air around the rocket.
It also works in a vacuum or in outer space which is a vacuum.
The moon is easier to reach than you realize.
Oh sure, it's a cinch!
Only 240,000 miles!
Paved highway all the way and a gas station at every intersection!
Fuel is no problem, Woody. The engines do not have to blast all the time.
Just long enough to get away from the gravitational pull of the Earth.
Following which you fall wherever you are headed for.
Get in and I'll demonstrate!
Let me out of here!
Help! Help!
At the start, the jets blast powerfully enough... to counteract the gravitational pull of the Earth.
Once out of the Earth's atmosphere, the rocket just keeps on going... encountering no resistance to slow it up.
The rocket does not appear to be traveling... but the high speed or escape velocity as we call it... is about 7 miles a second.
It keeps falling in outer space in the direction in which it was started.
Now as it nears the moon, that planet's gravitational field begins to pull it toward it.
Can't hear you, Woody! No air remember. Turn on your aerial!
Hey, no brakes on this thing!
I'm going to crash!
How do I land?
Very simple. Just reverse the takeoff.
But what about the wings?
Can't use them. The moon has no air.
Now he tells me!
Turn the ship around. Use the shotgun kick of the exhaust to break the speed... and set her gently on her tail.
Se we made it!
But how do we get home from this piece of cheese?
Shooting a rocket from the moon to the Earth... is a great deal easier than shooting from the Earth to the moon... because it's downhill almost all the way.
The V2 rocket could do it today.
On the return trip, we use the wings to glide in.
And for economy's sake, we finish the landing like this.
Sensational!
I'm sold!
I'll back it to the hilt!
Here's my 2 bucks!
Well, when do we start building?
Well gentlemen, when do we start building?
You've examined our model; you've seen our little picture.
I hope we've succeeded in dispelling your original skepticism.
Mr. Barnes can you imagine me going before a meeting of my stockholders... and reporting that I'd put millions into a trip to the moon?
Why some would lynch me!
I doubt it even in Texas, when you tell them why.
It just happens we have no choice.
If we want to stay in business, we have to build this ship!
Did you say "have" to build it, Jim?
That's what I said!
- If it's that important a project... why doesn't the government undertake it?
The vast amount of brains, talent, special skills, research facilities... necessary for this project are not in the government!
Nor can they be mobilized by the gov't in peacetime without fatal delay.
Only American industry can do this job!
And American industry must get to work now!
Just as we did in the last war!
Yes, but the government footed the bill!
And they'll foot this bill too if we're successful. You know that.
If we fail, we'll take a colossal beating, so we can't fail!
Not only is this the greatest adventure awaiting mankind... but it's the greatest challenge ever hurled at American industry!
And General Thayer is going to tell you why!
The reason is quite simple... we are not the only ones who know that the moon can be reached.
We are not the only ones planning to go there.
The race is on!
And we'd better win it because... there is absolutely no way to stop an attack from outer space!
The first country that can use the moon for the launching of missiles... will control the Earth!
That gentlemen, is the most important military fact of this century!
Gentlemen!
I see no need for further discussion!
It's our job!
Well, all I got to say is we better build it in Texas.
It's the only state big enough to hold it!
If you can increase the initial velocity only 600ths of a mile per second... you can make the trip in
2 days instead of four.
We'll have to compute what that means in reaction mass.
This is a case where pounds of ship costs many pounds of reaction mass.
Try titanium!
That's exactly right as far as appearance goes.
All that remains now is to test it.
It goes for it's atmosphere chamber test this afternoon.
I've added one detail, Charles.
What is that for?
The chaffing suits we wear over our pressure suits are in different colors.
Why?
- For identification.
We'll use these 4 colors for the 4 crew members then nobody can get lost.
The moonscape is pretty drab.
These bright colors will give us high visibility.
Your right if no one minds looking like a carnival balloon!
Hey, Brownie!
What do you want?
Have you taken a look down from here?
No, I never liked high places. Why?
You're halfway to the moon already!
It's the other half that's tough!
- I wouldn't worry about that!
How come?
Who are you kidding? This thing is as close to the moon as it'll get!
I never felt so silly in my life as I have since you sent for me!
You show me all your nice plans for instruments to navigate to the moon.
I help you build them.
We install them.
You teach me how they work and I understand how they work.
But nobody tells me how the ship works!
This thing is built like the Washington Monument!
You could stick an atom bomb under it and it wouldn't go!
What's the matter, Brownie?
It's nothing. Just a bellyache.
You been eating green apples?
I haven't been able to eat anything.
I tried to get you before you left
Washington. - Is anything wrong?
It's not the engine, is it?
Have you tested it?
Not yet and it doesn't look like we're going to.
"I'm directed to inform you that your petition to test an atomic engine... is regretfully denied."
Denied?
"It is our opinion that a danger exists should the engine fail structurally."
"There is a possibility of dispersal of radioactive materials."
We've told them a dozen times the area is cleared for 10 miles around.
"While it is admitted that no real danger of atomic explosion exists... a belief in such danger does exist in the public mind."
"It is the policy of the Commission..."
- Policy, my foot!
Somebody's throwing a monkey wrench!
- Wait, there's more.
"The test is authorized at the Special
Weapons Testing Center in the S. Pacific.
South Pacific?
That's nice of them!
What's the matter with the North Pole or Little America?
What's a few months delay?
There trying to protect their own necks.
You can't buck public opinion!
Have you seen this?
That isn't public opinion, it's propaganda!
You're right it is! Manufactured and organized with money and brains!
Somebody's out to get us.
Stops us in our tracks anyway.
We'll have to reschedule.
- With what?
What do you mean?
What are we going to use for money?
We've pushed our resources to the limit!
Every day of delay costs!
Hey, Doc...
The ship's about ready to take off, isn't she?
Except for tests and minor adjustments.
What's the next favorable time?
About a month from now.
- I don't mean that.
What's the next favorable time this month?
The only favorable time this month is about 17 hours from now.
That's it then.
We take off in 17 hours.
Are you out of your mind?
I will be if we run into any more red tape. Now look...
There's no law against taking off a spaceship.
It's never been done, so it's not been prohibited.
If we ask for permission, they'll find a way to block us. So we go now!
In an untested ship?
How do you test a thing of this kind?
It either works or it doesn't!
It's a one time deal!
Doc, any worries about the engine?
None, but we haven't trained a crew!
So we don't. The takeoff is fully automatic.
The General and I will run the ship.
You'll be the Engineer.
Brown has known from the beginning that he'll handle the radio and radar.
What about ballistics?
That's where we're stuck. The takeoff wasn't planned for this month.
It's a week's work!
You think Dr. Hastings is pretty good, don't you?
The best in the world!
- Give him the job!
And all the black coffee and assistants he can use!
You all set, General?
- All set! - Then it's settled.
We'll all be heroes or angels so what can we lose?
We'll takeoff tomorrow morning before dawn.
We've a lot in 17 hours!
Get me my home.
I'd like to talk to Mrs. Cargraves.
All roads have been blocked.
Because of the danger of radioactivity, the area is being cleared of spectators.
Do not attempt to approach the site of the spaceship!
The public is asked to stay away.
I shall repeat this warning...
Do not attempt to approach the site of the spaceship!
Correction: 22.79
Yes?
Mr. Brown still cannot be located,
Mr. Barnes.
Check with the main gate, the store, everywhere. Keep calling me back.
What was the last one?
Yes?
Mr. Sweeney is here to see
General Thayer.
Send him in.
What's up, Joe?
- It's Brown, sir.
They've taken him to the hospital.
- The hospital? Is he alright?
He will be after they cut out his appendix.
What will we do?
Say, Joe. Joe!
You can handle the ship's radio and radar equipment, can't you?
You know as much about it as Brown.
Will you take his place?
To the moon?
What's the moon got that this desert ain't?
Besides...
- Besides what, Joe?
I got a date with a nice little chick tomorrow.
No thanks!
Joe!
Unless you come with us, we're sunk!
You're the only man left who knows how to handle the equipment.
Mr. Barnes, mind if I sound off a little?
What do you mean?
- You're pretty smart men... you and Dr. Cargraves and the General.
I don't know as much as you do, but...
- What's on your mind?.
You're all wet!
- In what way?
The thing won't work. It can't!
It's crazy! Figure all that weight.
It won't budge an inch.
And what do I see them putting in the fuel tanks? Water!
You're all going to look like a bunch of dummies!
If you believed that, you'd come along.
Yeah, but I don't want to look like a dummy.
You wouldn't. We're entirely responsible for the whole thing.
You don't think it could blow up?
We'd never get in it if we thought that.
Joe...
You have confidence in Dr. Cargraves, me, the General... we wouldn't ask you to do anything we didn't believe in.
Would you like to go?
Okay.
I'll sit up there with you and twiddle the knobs, just for laughs.
Fine, Joe.
It'll never budge!
- Be sure you twiddle the right knobs!
You guys are really serious, ain't ya?
Dead serious.
Hey, wait a minute!
I've got to get through!
Sorry, nobody passes here.
- You have to take me through!
I've got a court order here forbidding them from taking off!
I'm sorry you couldn't bring the boys, Emily.
I couldn't; you gave me so little time.
Like to go in my place, Mrs. Cargraves?
Who me? Oh, dear no.
Don't worry ma'am.
We won't get very far.
Coming Doc?
- In a moment.
It's about time, Charles.
Bye, Mrs. Cargraves.
We'll take good care of your husband.
Try not to worry.
Mr Barnes, there's a joker back there trying to crash the gate!
He has a court order and it says you can't take off!
Darling!
Come back to me, Charles.
Doc, come on!
Hastings, I wish you had room for me in the ship!
You've got to stay here and make sure we get home!
Goodbye and good luck.
Alright, take it away!
Barnes! Cargraves!
Stop!
Come back here!
We can't hear a word you say!
Alright, Jim.
You're the skipper, take over.
First time I outranked a general.
First time I've heard you admit you were outrank by anybody.
Am I the only one who's scared?
This thing might work!
We're all scared.
Alright, gentlemen.
Takeoff stations.
Communications?
I'll have it all cooking in a minute.
As soon as the TV screen is operating, check clearance at base of ship.
Then phone check the Tracking Center at Dry Wells.
Cut in the boys at the traffic shack.
Calling traffic shack, over.
- Traffic to ship, over.
Official designation of ship is Luna.
L-U-N-A. Luna, over.

2...fire!
What's happening?
What's the matter?
Nothing's the matter.
Just passed the speed of sound.
Joe... switch on view aft.
I can't move a muscle.
I'm froze solid.
Do it!
We're falling.
It's alright, Joe. We're weightless, in free orbit that's all.
Weightless?
Free orbit?
Just where are we?
You mean this thing is working?
We're...no, sir! Not me!
Nobody ever told me this was practical!
Turn this thing around!
Take me back!
I ain't going to no moon!
That's just to look at!
I'm sick.
Grab hold.
Hang on.
What happened to me?
You're alright.
In free orbit, everything is falling at the same speed.
Everything unfastened just floats.
There's no up or down.
Tell that to my stomach!
It says there's nothing but up!
Oh, boy!
Am I seasick!
You're not seasick, you're space sick!
I'm sick of that too!
Take one of these pills.
It'll settle your stomach.
I can't swallow. It won't go down!
It'll take practice without gravity to help. You'll manage.
General, how are you feeling?
You got another one of those pills?
- Here's a whole box full.
Let's see if I can swallow better than Sweeney.
Unless these pills work, space travel isn't going to be popular.
Don't!
Think of the condition of my stomach!
Shoes, General?
- Thank you.
Let's get these on you. They've got magnets in the soles.
How do you feel now?
The way I did when I tried my first smoke.
You'll be alright in a minute. Put that one on and try to get Dry Wells.
Spaceship Luna calling Dry Wells.
Spaceship Luna calling Dry Wells, over.
Dry Wells to Spaceship Luna.
Man alive, I can't believe it!
Your takeoff checked out according to flight plan.
We are now tracking you by radar.
You are in your calculated orbit.
We will continue to track you as long as we can. Good luck, over.
Thank you, Dry Wells and roger.
Doc, General. You've got to see this.
Gosh, ain't that something!
I thought I'd seen everything.
Just look at those cities!
Is that Los Angeles?
- And San Francisco.
Sure! That's Los Angeles.
That's New York!
Can you see Brooklyn?
Sure there's Brooklyn.
I wonder who's pitching?
Joe!
I want to test the radar.
The antenna seems to be stuck.
Stuck?
I don't understand it. I was particularly careful when I greased it.
Greased it?
No wonder it's stuck!
It's exposed to outer space! It's frozen solid! You should know better than that!
I'm no scientist!
Didn't  you bother to read the engineering instructions?
Arguing won't get us anywhere.
The radar has to be fixed.
To try to land blind would be our finish.
How do we fix it, Doc?
Somebody has to go outside and free it.
- Outside?
You mean go outside the ship?
- It can't be done any other way.
We'd be swept off!
- No, you can't fall.
Outside, you'll be in the same orbit and trajectory as the ship.
The worst that could happen is that you'd drift away from the side.
We avoid that by using safety lines.
Let's do it!
No Jim, I'll go.
I want to inspect the rocket jet anyway to see how it stood up on the takeoff.
I'll tag along.
- Me too.
I fouled us up and if you guys go out, so do I.
Coming, General.
- No.
I'm not curious.
You boys go have your fun.
I'll stay and write up the log.
Green is just the color for you,
Sweeney.
Ready to put on the helmets?
I won't be able to breathe in here!
You won't be able to breathe without it.
Hook up your air hose.
You forget there's no air outside.
There's plenty of room for it!
Check radios.
Check instruments.
Check air.
Let's go!
I'm going to get another line!
Now it will open.
Close it, Skipper!
We'll fall out!
Get this through your head, Joe.
You can't fall.
Let's go!
Hey, we're stuck up here!
We ain't moving!
It only seems that way. We're really traveling thousands of miles per hour.
Here in space, all comparisons are lost.
Take a look behind you.
Wow!
The geography books are right.
How do you feel now, Joe?
Weird.
Thousands of miles an hour and not a breeze.
It's more beautiful than
I ever dreamed.
We will never be able to describe it to anyone.
I'm going aft. See you shortly.
Wait until we finish this.
I'll go with you.
You stay here and take care of the radar. Give me a rope.
Help yourself.
I'll be back in a minute.
Skip! Joe! Help!
I'm adrift!
I can't get back!
Tie it off to the ship.
- Where?
Off the stern. Come on!
Jim! Joe! Help!
Can you hear me?
I'm adrift!
Coming, Doc!
Hurry! If we can't get him, he will float forever!
Get a rope to him!
Captain, towards the stern!
We're working towards you, Doc.
We can see you.
Jim, Joe! Is he alright?
Can you get him?
We've go to get him!
- I'm coming out!
Steady, Doc.
We're going to get a rope to you.
Steady, Doc!
Here it comes!
Catch!
I can't reach it!
We'll try again.
General! Can you hear me?
Bring out an oxygen bottle!
Hurry!
Hurry, Jim!
Joe, help!
General! That oxygen tank, hurry!
Where is he?
Way out there.
What are you going to do?
Get him!
I hope it's got enough kick!
General, grab him!
We'll lose him too!
I almost didn't make it.
Can we get back?
If we don't, we'll tour the universe together! Hang on, I'm going to turn it.
Pray there's enough gas to get us back.
He's got him!
Give me the rope!
You okay, Doc?
- I didn't think we'd make it!
Come on, boys.
Let's go inside.
We're getting close.
- Standing by, ready to fire.
Here goes the turn.
We're going backwards!
Yes, we're going to use the firing as brakes.
Stand by for acceleration.
Tracking as predicted.
Good. Radar report?
Altitude 108000.
Closing as predicted.
- Power?
Plant okay.
That didn't slow us! We're going faster than ever! - No we're not!
It seems that way because we're close and heading in.
I just decided I don't want to go through with this thing. Let's go home!
Cut it out, Joe.
Give me the view aft.
View aft.
Power plant?
- On manual.
Ready now...
Holy smoke! We can't land on that, we'll be splattered!
Quit worrying. We're landing in the smooth plain short of there.
I'm going to kill our forward speed.
Stand by.
Acceleration!
You missed, Jim!
- I know it! Emergency!
Pick her up, Jim!
Give us some lateral!
Too late! Too much firing and we can't get home.
I'll have to use the drift we've got.
You going to chance it, Jim?
- Have to!
Automatic landing!
- Automatic, it is.
Co-pilot!
Tracking in on automatic.
Tracking now.
Cover me at 830 feet.
Covered at 830.
- Correction...cover at 870.
870, right. Can you miss those peaks?
- Got a prayer in your pocket?
Correction...860!
Tracking steady.
All hands brace for crash!
We're down.
We're down.
Cut out your gyros.
Okay.
Fine landing, Jim.
That was a terrible landing and you know it!
I mean for a first one.
I wasted reaction mass we'll need to get back. If we get back.
Worry about that later, we just got here.
Here...
On the moon!
Jim, Doc...
We're on the moon!
And we're alive!
Holy cow! The next time you tell me you can get to the moon, I'll believe you.
You waited a long time for this, Doc.
- All my life.
Sweeney, how about trying to raise Washington?
You bet! Wait until I tell them...
First race: Spaceship Luna in the lead, way out in front!
Doc, Jim. You two go down and set foot on the surface.
That's something I want to enter in my log.
No, I think we should all go together.
- Nonsense, you made this trip possible.
Spaceship Luna calling Washington.
Come on then, Doc.
This is your moment.
Let's get into our spacesuits.
Let's go.
Come on.
Claim it, Doc. I'm your witness.
Claim it officially.
By the grace of God, and in the name of the United States of America...
I take possession of this planet on behalf of, and for the benefit of... 
all mankind. 
Dr. Cargraves!
Mr. Barnes!
Yes? - I'm in contact with Washington.
There's terrific excitement on Earth!
We're hooked up to all the networks.
They just interviewed the General.
They want to interview you two. I've patched your radio into the transmitter.
I hooked up our receiver too. You can have a two-way conversation with them.
Okay, go ahead Earth!
Hello! Hello on the moon!
This is Carl Zurski, greeting you from the Earth.
The people of the world congratulate you for your epoch-making achievement!
Thank you.
I must explain to the listeners of the lag between...
my voice and those from the moon is due to the vastness of space.
It takes 3 seconds even at the speed of light, for radio waves to travel...
between the Earth and moon.
Can you tell us where you landed?
The astronomers at Palomar say they could see you if they knew where to look
We landed in the crater Harpalus... which is in the upper NW quadrant of the moon as seen from North America.
Is Dr. Cargraves hooked in?
- Yes.
Can you give us your first impressions of the moon, Dr. Cargraves?
Well, I'll try.
The first impression is... one of utter barrenness and desolation.
Then the silence...
As there is not air, the only sound we hear comes through our radios.
The sky is... black.
Velvet black and pierced by the most intensely... brilliant stars anyone ever dreamed of.
Hanging over the mountains in the distance, I can see our own planet Earth many times larger than the harvest moon.
I see most of the Western Hemisphere... and I can also see it's about sunrise in San Francisco.
It's afternoon here... and will be for a couple of more days.
Now perhaps, Jim Barnes can add something.
As a matter of record... may I report that the moment he sat foot on the moon...
Dr. Cargraves claimed possession in the name of the United States... for the benefit of all mankind!
This is great and wonderful news for the people of the Earth! Thank you!
The Naval Station in Washington will stand by 24 hours a day for....
further signals from you.
Goodbye and good luck!
Roger.
Doc, I'll never get use to this.
This must weigh 500 or 600 pounds!
On Earth it does. Gravity here is about 1/6 as much.
That means things weigh 1/6 as much.
I know it, but I can't believe it.
General, look!
Sweeney, cut that out!
What's the matter? If I could do that back home, I'd be an acrobat!
We've got too much to do and too little time for any more clowning.
Let's get on with our schedule!
I'm suppose to help you with the astronomical photos, Doc.
I can't for a bit. I've got to Earth and get Hastings to give us... revised figures for our trip back.
Well, I'll just have to wait for you.
- Joe, you help him.
I can handle the radio.
Joe was going to help me with the mineralogical survey!
You can get along without him.
You've only got one Geiger Counter.
But don't lose sight of the ship!
That's a rule for everybody!
Okay, Skipper.
I'll help you later, General.
I'm for seeing what there is to see!
I don't figure on staying here too long anyway. Do you know why?
No beer, no babes, no baseball!
- You got it!
Well Doc, I'll pack this little gadget.
I'll join you after I talk to Hastings.
Say Doc, there is one thing I'd like as a souvenir of the trip.
How about taking a picture of me up here alongside the camera?
Sure Joe, that's not too much to ask.
Give me the little camera.
Move a little closer!
That's it!
Wait a minute, I have a better idea.
Come over here.
Now turn around...
Now hold your arm up.
Bend your elbow as though you were holding a heavy weight.
Now your hand...
That's it. Hold it!
Okay. That'll be something to show!
What is it Doc?
- You and the Earth.
You're holding it up like a modern Atlas.
Hey, that's something Doc.
There's only one thing...
- What's that?
Nobody will know it's me in this diving suit!
Hey, Doc!
Joe!
Over here!
Behind you!
Charles, I picked up clicks.
Here, hold this.
I picked them up a few yards back.
They are stronger in this direction.
Listen to this.
There's a trace, eh?
- What is it, Doc?
I'm not sure. - These mountains may have a real deposit.
Uranium?
- It's possible.
Then you could blow up the moon too.
Ain't that dandy!
Check your reaction mass.
Point 8672.
What? Repeat that.
Yes, point 8672.
I wasted power making a very bad landing.
I'll have to compute it, but it looks bad.
We have to get you back.
Jettison every ounce.
All your forward tanks are empty.
Can you rip them out?
Not without tearing the ship apart.
She wasn't built for it.
I'll call at the same time 24 hours from now. I'll give you the answers.
Be able to tell me how much you lightened the ship... 
and I'll tell you if you can make it.
I'll stand by 24 hours from now.
Just get us back home.
That's all I ask.
Hello, Jim!
We've got news for you!
- I have for you too. All of you.
This is right up your alley, Jim.
- Hold it, General.
Sit down the camera, Joe and Doc.
It's no use to us.
I haven't shot more than a half a dozen plates.
That's all you'll be able to shoot.
- What's the matter?
I just talked to Dr. Hastings at Dry Wells.
I gave our instrument readings.
Reaction mass, mass ratio... checked our time.
Well?
- Our time is okay.
Nothing else is.
What are you talking about, Skipper?
Everything on the board is ticking.
I checked every instrument. All alive.
So are we. For awhile.
I don't get it.
We have to lighten the ship!
Our job for the next 24 hours is to get rid of everything we can.
Or stay here ourselves.
Hastings will give me the answers at
Well, let's not panic until we've talked to him again.
Meanwhile... - We go back to the ship and strip off everything we can!
Acceleration couch pad 4.
Serial number 706. Schedule B.
706 Schedule B, check.
And the schedule itself!
That's everything that you can get out?
3 of our spacesuits will be dropped before takeoff.
One will be used in the airlock to dump the others.
Skipper, I'll dump the stuff.
It'll take me 15 minutes to check again.
I'll give you the answer asap.
Here's the wash!
36 hours.
36 hours, what?
Until takeoff time.
It's then or a month from then.
That means never.
Spaceship Luna, Spaceship Luna.
Spaceship Luna, Barnes speaking.
Here's the total: you've taken out almost 2 tons.
Before takeoff, drop all the oxygen except what you need to get back on.
Before takeoff, you can drop your remaining food.
You can hold yourselves to a pint of water a day...
and throw the rest of your drinking water into the reaction tank.
Have you got it?
- Right!
You'll have to get out another
1,000 pounds.
Another 1,000? Of what?
We're stripped!
Don't make me say this... you have to or...
You don't have to say it.
We know.... or we don't get back!
I'm standing by.
You've got to work it out!
Hey, Sweeney... is this thing bolted or welded?
Bolted.
Let's get to work.
Give me a wrench!
I guess we used this one up.
Doc, we'll be able to takeoff, won't we?
Probably. Takeoff, at least.
What do you mean, "at least"?
If we're too heavy, we'll crash or fall into an orbit around the moon.
Just keep on going around?
That's it.
Hey, Skipper! That's my radar!
- We won't need it to land on Earth.
You don't know how much work
I did putting this together!
Now, anybody with anything in your pockets?
This too?
- Everything!
The 3 spacesuits then come back.
How much time we got?
27 minutes.
Another 110 pounds.
- What?
Another 110 pounds and you can coast home!
We're stripped. We'll have to take a chance as we are.
That's suicide!
You haven't enough power to pull free of the moon.
You could be wrong, couldn't you?
I could.
I don't think the computer could.
Ask Dr. Cargraves.
We'll let you know, roger.
Well Charles, is he right?
I'm afraid so.
We're stuck here!
Who got me here?
I didn't want to come!
You can blame me, Joe.
You didn't think it would work.
Well, in a way, you were right.
What a sucker! What a dumb, stupid blockhead I am!
I could have blown my brains out or gone over Niagara Falls... or found some other decent way to die!
Alright, Joe.
We're all in this together.
It's as simple as that.
One of us stays.
Of course.
I weight 180. More than enough.
- Now look here....
I'm the oldest. I've done my job.
- I'm the Skipper of this ship!
I give the orders on this ship!
I'm giving the orders now!
- Jim, nobody gives orders.
- Yes, they do. This is the order...
Doc is the engineer. 
He goes back to his work.
The General pilots the ship when you reach the Earth's atmosphere.
I can be spared on this trip. I have no family. My job gets along without me.
Jim, listen to me. This is not a ship at sea and this is not a plane.
This has been a joint undertaking.
The 3 of us did it together.
It is no ones duty more than the others to give his life.
I've had my day. A great one!
I've shown that this could be done!
It's enough to make me glad I lived and content to stay.
It's very noble, Doc, but it's philosophy.
Skip philosophy! I'm the one who stays.
Why? Because I'm the oldest.
You two can tell them back home what we've seen much better than I could.
Tell them how we looked up and saw the Earth... vulnerable and exposed forever.
Never setting in this lunar sky.
You know what you just proved, General?
You're the one man that must go back!
Are we going to end this in futility because we can't make a simple decision?
I've reached my decision!
I'm standing by it!
Skipper, look here...
- Stay out of this, Sweeney.
Don't worry, you'll get back.
Right now it looks like nobody gets back!
If you brains can't make up your minds, why don't you do what kids do?
Match for it.
You know, draw lots.
Alright!
- No!
Jim, two against one.
- What do we use?
Anyone have paper, matches, coins?
- No, everything's overboard.
You've got buttons on your coveralls.
Match them.
Spaceship Luna...Spaceship Luna.
Dry Wells calling Spaceship Luna.
Spaceship Luna to Dry Wells.
We're are working it out. One of us will stay behind We're drawing lots.
Only 110 pounds! There must be something more!
Check time!
9:31:50. 18 minutes to zero hour.
Check.
We'll take off with three men.
Where's Joe?
He's gone!
What's wrong? You're not coming in!
It won't open!
He's not in there!
- Then he...he can't do that!
Spaceship Luna, Spaceship Luna!
He's left the ship!
- Stand by, something's happened.
Sweeney's left the ship! His helmet's gone! I can't see him!
There he is! He's dragging something!
Sweeney!
Sweeney!
Sweeney, can you hear me?
Sure, I hear you.
Come back, Joe!
And die in that steel death trap?
You won't die, Joe. Not you.
You're going home!
Not a chance. Goodbye, fellows. Remember me to the gals. Any gals!
Spaceship Luna, you're not coming in!
Here's Doc. Talk to him.
Something's happened! Joe's left the ship! - Are you taking off?
I don't know! We got to do something!
- Joe, we can't let you do this!
What do you mean let me?
You can't stop me.
I lightened your ship.
I gave you your chance, now get going.
Don't make a monkey out of me.
Come back, Joe! We're in this together.
If you don't, we can't takeoff.
You've got to or you'll be killing me for nothing.
Nobody's asking you to, you're killing yourself!
Takeoff, will you?
I want to see it.
A ship going back from the moon to the Earth!
Joe, i just thought of a way...
A way to what?
- Takeoff. All of us! Hurry!
What do you mean "all of us"?
Do just as I tell you. 
I think we can make it!
You wouldn't kid me?
- Don't be a fool!
It's our lives too. We've less than
15 minutes!
What's the deal?
- Get back to the airlock fast.
Bring a screwdriver, knife and a file.
And a weight, an oxygen tank.
Tie the tank to the end of your safety line.  
I'll tell you the rest when you're in the airlock!
Is he coming?
- He's picking up the things!
He's heading towards us!
- What's your plan?
Sweeney's spacesuit weighs 70 pounds, the radios 50. There's over 110 pounds!
We can't open the door to the airlock without his spacesuit.
We won't open it when he gets his spacesuit off! 
He can drill a small hole in the door big enough for a safety line.
He ties the tank to the line and it hangs outside...
The line passes through the small hole...
There's a slow leak. He takes off his suit, ties it to the line and comes here.
We decompress the airlock, the door opens, the suit is dragged out.
General, watch for him.
He must be in the airlock. It's cycling.
- He's in there.
Pressure's up. I can open it.
Let me have a screwdriver.
General, unscrew the radio!
Sweeney, listen carefully...
Hastings! We're coming home!
All of us!
You won't hear from us again until you see us. I'm ripping out the radio!
Sweeney, listen carefully.
Put on the helmet, go to the airlock, decompress it and open the outer door.
Takeoff stations!
Sweeney, as soon as your strap's fast, television view aft.
Strap's okay here.
Power plant?
All ready to go.
No time for count off, standby!
Fire!
We're going home.
Cradled within the arms of the rivers Ganges and Branmaputra to the south...
... and the mysterious plateau of Tibet to the north...
... majestically stands the mightiest mountain range on the face of the earth.
The Himalayas.
This is the story of an expedition to this rugged barrier.
Not to settle on its windswept towering heights...
... but to find and study plant life...
... which had heretofore been unknown or inaccessible.
This is the story of that mission.
Of how a small group of people found themselves in pursuit of a crude and primitive civilization...
... which once only existed as a figment of the imagination.
Starting from Los Angeles, California...
... and after careful study of the region...
... the first leg of the expedition took me to Bombay, India.
From there I proceeded to the town of Shekar...
... the last settlement before entering the wilderness of rock and ice.
There I selected Sherpa natives to serve as porters.
My name is Parrish.
Dr. Frank Parrish.
By profession, I am a botanist, working for the Corey Foundation.
To record the visual log of our expedition,
I engaged Peter Wells...
... well-qualified to serve as a photographer.
As our guide, I hired Subra, the only English- speaking Sherpa acquainted with the terrain.
Only the most essential equipment was selected and distributed among the members of our party.
All preparations completed and everything on schedule...
... at noon on June 14th, we set out to strike at the mountain.
Subra's young wife Tala and his brother
Leva accompanied us to the foot of the mountain...
... before saying goodbye.
The first days were uneventful, monotonous and tedious.
But as we moved onto higher regions, the terrain became more rugged and difficult.
Wells and I kept up with the Sherpas...
... who were much like human mules under the weight of our heavy supplies.
We continued on to a height of ten thousand feet above sea level...
... where I wanted to commence my work.
At last came the day we reached the plateau region.
Subra, have your men pitch the tents.
Up to this point, having established only temporary camps...
... everyone was eager for our first hot meal.
Camp One was now well-established.
Except for a variety of common moths and crucifer flower...
... we found little of interest.
But we decided to comb the area more thoroughly for the next few days.
How about a shot?
No, thanks.
Excuse me, Mr. Doctor. Everything alright?
Everything's fine, Subra. Thank you.
Alcohol good?
It's fine.
Here, help yourself.
- Thank you, Mr. Doctor Wells.
- I'm no doctor.
Want anything?
No, thank you, Subra. I'll see you later.
I fix nice hot supper.
A wonderful tonic. It warms up the gizzards.
You'll find out when you pickle your gizzard.
Wells, I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't hand out that stuff to any of the men and...
Don't drink in their presence, understand?
Okay. Suits me.
Shekar, come in.
Come in, Shekar.
It's Dr. Parrish.
This is Shekar. Yes, doctor.
Let me speak to an Inspector Karma, please.
Will get Inspector Karma.
That night all seemed well in the town of Shekar.
Mr. Doctor.
Mr. Doctor!
Oh, Subra, what is it?
Yeti. Yeti, Mr. Doctor.
- Yeti!
- What's all the noise?
It's my brother Leva. He come with four men.
They've followed us all the way up here?
What do they want?
Brother say Yeti steal my woman, Tala.
- We need go after Yeti.
- Yeti, Yeti, what is this?
Yeti, creature of snow. Snow giant!
Oh, you mean the abominable snowman, the phantom of the Himalayas.
Marauder of women.
We go after Yeti, find him.
Oh, the newspapers and magazines have carried stories about it from time to time.
Yeah, the Sherpas have built this creature into a horror story.
This isn't a hunting party. Thousands of dollars have been spent to finance this expedition.
And he wants to chase a legend.
- Mr. Doctor, Yeti real, Mr. Doctor.
- No one's ever seen one.
Oh, I know people have brought back stories about these semi-humans.
Oh, the whole thing sounds fantastic.
Let us leave. Yeti steal Tala!
I'm sorry, Subra. Have your brother and his men join us if they want to.
But we have other work to do.
Because of my decision, I felt that Subra resented and disliked me.
What do you think's going on out there?
Well, it sounds like Subra trying to be very important.
I better find out.
Subra!
Subra!
Well?
I don't know what they're up to.
What do you mean?
Subra, I want to talk to you.
Talk.
What's the meaning of this? I gave no order to break camp.
- We move.
- I'll tell you when to move.
We move now.
Subra, what's come over you?
You sent some of our men away, didn't you?
Only four of our men.
Other four belong Brother Leva.
I'm concerned with our men. Now get them back!
They look this side of mountain.
We look the other side.
For Yeti.
I'll shoot any man who doesn't obey.
You no can shoot.
Empty! They've taken our cartridges!
Subra, this is mutiny.
Subra take guns.
Alright. Where do you intend to look for this creature?
Everybody look rocky valley legend.
Why, that's ridiculous.
This party's not equipped for that kind of thing.
Subra no care.
Well, you might as well let them go.
There's no point in our following them along.
We might as well go back.
- Turn back?
- No can find the way.
We move now.
Well, I think I need a drink.
Yeah, you'll need more than that.
Wait a minute.
Forgot about the radio.
By Jove, that's an idea.
Get packed! We move right away.
Come on. Come on!
Whether Wells and I liked it or not, we had no alternative but to follow along.
Take it easy, Wells.
Wait a minute.
Did you hear something?
No, it's just the ruddy wind.
I think this is it.
Give me some light.
Oh, it's my Scotch!
Nevermind that now.
There it is.
Let's hope they haven't been monkeying with it.
It looks alright.
Wait a minute.
It's okay. Go ahead.
Shekar, come in.
Come in, Shekar.
Shekar, come in.
Shekar, come in.
Subra!
Subra only want to kill radio machine.
Where is Scotch?
- No, wait a minute. That's my personal property!
- Take it easy, Wells!
Subra like alcohol.
Mr. Doctor, get out, go sleep now.
- Big walk tomorrow.
- If you do --
Take it easy, you two. Come on.
Come on!
Well...
No radio, no nothing.
I'll get it to work.
- We'll get the Shekar police.
- Oh, I hope so.
Wells, have yourself a nightcap.
I'll be right back.
Oh, thanks, old boy. I will.
I found that the radio could be repaired.
Wells' case of Scotch gave me an idea.
What was that?
I didn't hear anything.
There it is again.
Oh, it's just the wind.
The altitude's getting on your nerves.
My nerves are alright.
I better take a look.
We move now!
Don't you think you had enough last night?
Come on!
Mr. Doctor, we leave now.
The Yeti. Yeti go up there.
We track, follow steps.
Subra, aren't you forgetting something?
No want men to have radio machine.
It's dead.
Lost the trail.
Yeti no stop here. We go up.
Even Subra could not fight the darkness.
At sundown, he ordered the men to make camp.
I still think it was a pretty mean trick...
... leaving my tonic behind.
The tubes were alright, but the wires are broken.
Oh, now you find out, after depriving me of my...
Wait a minute!
Alright, go ahead.
He's dead.
I couldn't rest.
A legend, the abduction of Subra's wife...
... the footprints...
... the death of a native.
All these things began to fall into a mysterious pattern.
It looks like it's over.
We were lucky!
I'll say we were.
We rest here.
You know... this altitude's beginning to get me.
 We're getting pretty high up.
We'll probably be needing oxygen soon.
Storm come. Need to find shelter.
Sky dark.
Look over there.
Cave.
How long will it take us to get down there?
One hour.
Maybe two.
Lucky thing for us we found this place.
Yeah, it would've been impossible in the tents with this weather.
Subra.
Yes?
Come here a minute.
You know, you could be a very famous man.
- Oh, yes?
- Yeah.
If we did find this Yeti and brought him back to America alive.
Sir, we only want to kill Yeti.
Suppose you did kill one.
How would you know it's the one you're after?
If there's one Yeti, there must be a whole civilization, or a whole tribe of them.
So we kill all Yeti. Subra no care.
Well, how far up do you intend to go?
To the top of Everest or Anapurna?
Maybe yes.
Where are these creatures?
Why has no one ever seen one?
Yeti, him hide when smell human.
But Yeti come low country when want to steal woman.
Always want to steal woman.
We go until we find Yeti.
I think we go sleep now.
Move over, McDuff.
It's too bad.
What's too bad?
I tried to get to that radio, but it's in one of the Sherpa's packs.
Well, we'll just have to wait until we see a better opportunity.
Yeah.
Right now, I'm going to forget it and go to bed.
What is it, Subra?
This gold collar, my woman.
Tala!
Tala!
Yeti bring Tala here.
We go find Tala!
Tala!
I realized that the snow creature was not just a legend.
I consoled myself to the thought that finding one...
... would more than compensate for my failure as a botanist.
Subra was a man possessed.
He split the party, ordering the men to search the tunnels.
And to meet at the entrance to the cave.
Tala!
You know, this place gives me the creeps.
Well, it's not the most cheerful place in the world.
It's only an animal of some kind.
Subra!
What is it?
Let's go.
Yeti!
No!
Tala! Tala!
He's only stunned.
He's not dead.
Alright, give me that.
Now give him a highboard to keep him quiet.
Get a tarpaulin. We'll carry him in that.
Go on.
We found that the female and child of the snow creature had been killed by the cave-in.
We held Subra and led him at gunpoint.
And ordered them to carry the creature back to the entrance of the cave...
... to meet the rest of the Sherpas.
Subra, tell your men to put up their hands.
Wells, get that gun.
One false move and I'll shoot.
Tell that man to put the radio down.
I'll try to get the check on police.
Unable to establish contact with Shekar, we started down...
... determined to bring the creature back alive.
Wells and I took turns watching to make certain that nothing went wrong.
Wells, get the highboard!
We managed to keep the creature in a semi-conscious state...
... allowing him to come to only enough to take food.
So on the fifth day, we reached the lowland region.
On the seventh day, as we were nearing the town of Shekar...
... I decided to herd the natives straight to the police.
Corey Foundation, Los Angeles, California.
Right. Whom did you wish to speak with?
Mr. Corey Jr.
Corey Jr.
As I said, your foundation was granted permission to explore the Himalayas.
Your discovery is of a very unusual nature.
But it belongs to you, and you are free to do with it as you wish.
The inspector kept repeating how friendly his country was...
... and how it welcomed scientists, explorers, and so on.
I'm sure you will accept my government's apologies.
And the natives will be held in custody here for taking the law into their own hands.
Well, thank you.
By the way, can I keep the creature here until I can arrange for his transportation?
- Of course.
- Of course, he'll have to be fed.
And could you give him an injection every six hours?
Yes. We shall do that.
Oh, by the way, your guide wishes to speak with you.
- Subra?
- Yes.
Well, send him in.
- Mr. Doctor.
- Subra!
Subra no understand law. No can say.
If this Yeti steal my woman, nobody know.
Inspector Karma, I won't prefer charges against these people.
- Thank you, Mr. Doctor. Thank you!
- Oh, forget it, forget it.
Your telephone call. Will you take it in the next room?
Oh, fine. Come on, Wells.
Yes, that's the idea.
And please send the refrigerator unit as quickly as possible.
Fine, fine.
I'm leaving for Bombay immediately to take care of all the arrangements.
You can reach me there, let's see...
In care of the TWA office.
Well, good.
Oh, would you please call my wife and tell her I'll be home soon?
Good, thank you.
They're sending us a refrigerator unit to transport the creature in.
An air-conditioned affair.
What's the matter with you?
Well, I don't like this whole thing.
What do you mean?
Well, it's just this.
I could get two or three thousand pounds for that photograph I took.
And we should split that money between us.
As far as the creature's concerned, well, we should sell him and then --
The photograph, do what you want with it.
As for the creature, he's going to the Corey Foundation, where he belongs.
You've just got no business sense.
An opportunity like this comes once in a lifetime and you don't --
Did your telephone call come out alright?
Oh, yes, thank you. Clear as a bell.
I have to leave for Bombay right away, but I'll be back in a few days.
Would you see that nobody comes near the creature? Including Mr. Wells.
According to this cable, your temperature- controlled unit...
... should be here on our cargo flight at 8:40 this evening.
Now, the cable says to handle it with the utmost care.
Yes, it's very delicate.
We'll have to rush it to Shekar.
I've already made all the arrangements to send it and the documents to you.
And we'll take care of all other formalities.
Thank you very much.
We followed your instructions.
The injections worked fine.
Here he is.
Thank you.
Let's see. The base unit will keep the mortar running en route.
This is the temperature control.
And the self-contained oxygen unit.
Food traps.
Oh, yes, the food trap.
You old Americans!
Manufacturing a contraption like this on a phone call.
Well, I better get going.
Thank you very much, Inspector Karma.
Have a good trip back to California.
Hello, Frank!
Darling!
Hello, Mr. Corey. Glad to see you. How are you?
Well, instead of flowers, I brought you a Yeti.
That's what the natives call him.
Well, where is he now?
Well, he should be here. I sent him ahead on a cargo plane.
- Really?
- Which one of you is Dr. Parrish?
I am.
Hold onto the pretty girl, doctor, and give us a big smile.
- Thank you.
- I'm from The Chronicle, doctor.
Well, just a minute. I just got here.
I haven't even talked to my wife!
Now, gentlemen, you can reach Dr. Parrish at the foundation later.
'Dr. Frank Parrish, Dr. Frank Parrish.'
'Please report to the Customs warehouse.'
- Which way is it?
- Well, it's easy enough to find out. Come on.
Excuse me, gentlemen. I'll talk to you later.
Well, there it is, darling.
Mr. Corey, what do you think of it?
Amazing! Absolutely amazing!
I see where you classify your import as a snow creature.
That's right.
Well, it's necessary that we clarify its immigration status.
Immigration status?
I don't understand.
Well, the question is, is it a beast or a man?
Well, he's not human if that's what you mean.
- Do you know Mr. Peter Wells?
- Why, yes, he's my photographer.
This article came to our attention.
Mr. Wells refers to your discovery as a 'snow man'.
Well, that's ridiculous!
Wells is a photographer. He's reaching for sensational
This creature is definitely not human.
Mr. Fleet, certainly your department isn't going to take this photographer's work literally!
Well, this is a very unusual case.
This is a very unusual find.
Do you realize what this means to science?
That's why our department was interested enough to contact a prominent anthropologist...
... Dr. Louis Dupont.
Dr. Dupont?
Of course. I've heard of him. He should be well-qualified to substantiate Dr. Parrish.
Unfortunately, he can't be here til seven o'clock tonight.
You all be in my office at seven o'clock.
Of course.
This will have to stay in the warehouse until then.
We've studied the instructions on the refrigerator
It will be properly connected.
Well, I guess it will just have to wait.
We'll see you at seven.
Come on, darling.
What an unusual specimen!
The department's main interest is to classify this specimen, as you call it, as not being human.
- Dr. Parrish!
- Yes, may I?
- Of course.
- I'm a little early.
Well, that's alright. Dr. Parrish, Dr. Dupont.
- Oh, how do you do?
- How do you do, doctor?
- Has Mr. Corey been here?
- Not yet.
- Won't you sit down?
- Why, thank you.
- Cigarette?
- Thank you.
What an unusual find for a botanist to make!
Yes, it is.
And you say you also saw a female?
And a child?
That's right.
Have you seen the specimen I brought back?
No, not yet.
Well, we will as soon as Mr. Corey arrives.
He called and he should be here any minute.
I have said this creature is not human.
I didn't say he was.
I have to determine whether his brain is a calculating brain.
And from that, narrow down all the theories.
We must have one definite classification.
From what we know of, shall I say, these snow creatures, they have been a legend!
We have seen abstract drawings and heard stories of these nomads, but...
... they were always associated with human traits!
Excuse me.
Fleet speaking.
What? How?
We'll be right over.
- The creature has escaped.
- What?
Let's get over to the warehouse.
He started to move in that thing, then he started to shake it, and it fell.
He got out and I started to run for my life.
A sight I'll never forget.
He come at me and I --
Mr. Fleet?
- I'm Mr. Fleet.
- I'm Lieutenant Dunbar, Police.
This is Dr. Dupont, this is Dr. Parrish.
What's this all about?
You'll have to give us a description.
- Right.
- Where's the phone?
Right over there.
Come on, doctor. You can give it to the department firsthand.
That's all, Evans. Send it out right away.
Would you come with me a moment, doctor?
Certainly.
- Quite extraordinary, doctor.
- Right.
'Car 61. Come in, Lieutenant Dunbar.'
'Car 61. Come in, Lieutenant Dunbar.'
Dunbar, go ahead.
'Body of a girl found in the alley back of
1220 Coe Street.'
'Repeat. In alley back of 1220 Coe Street. Over.'
Got it. Out.
- You hear that, doctor?
- I better come along.
- I think you'd better.
- Oh, Mr. Fleet!
When Mr. Corey gets here, brief him on everything, will you?
I'll see you later!
- Hello, Lieutenant.
- What you doing, Richards?
I thought you were through for the day.
Looked that way, didn't it?
- Any news from my wife?
- Not yet. Mother-in-law's still with her.
Something wrong?
My wife and I are having a baby, that's all.
Oh, is that all?
This way.
Oh, thank you Charly.
Now, let's see.
This is the warehouse.
Over there's Coe Street, where the girl was killed.
The distance from here to here is about three miles.
Yeah, go on.
Well, it's strange to me that nobody reported seeing him...
... from the time he left the warehouse til he arrived at Coe Street.
It was late. Hardly anybody on the street.
I guess so.
He's got to be stopped.
Stopped, Lieutenant, but not killed.
Is there something else you can tell us about him, doctor?
His mentality, his habits, something?
Well, he's acclimated to a high altitude, low temperature.
We know all that.
Send out this bulletin to all radio stations and newspapers.
Tell everyone to stay off the streets and remain calm.
That goes for everybody.
Right.
Well, what do we do now?
There's nothing we can do, except wait for him to show up again.
'Attention all citizens. This is an urgent public service bulletin from your police department.'
'A dangerous killer beast is at large.'
'You are asked to remain indoors.'
'This is an urgent public service bulletin to all citizens.'
'A dangerous killer beast is at large.'
Don't! Don't! Don't do it, please!
- Don't.
- Now get out of here!
Please. You don't understand.
Give me a chance to explain, please.
- I'm sick of listening to your words.
- But please!
Now you stay away from me. And if I never see you again, it'll be too soon!
- Now get out of here!
- But --
Got it. Who's on the job?
Right.
He showed up again.
- Where?
He chased a girl, near an all-night pharmacy.
Let's see. He started here.
Then he appeared here.
And now, right here, the pharmacy. He's got to be within that triangle.
Instruct all units in Sectors 15 and 16 to converge at Area 11.
Right.
How about some more coffee, doctor?
Yeah, yeah.
Charlie, you got any more coffee?
Police!
Help! Police!
Why don't you go to bed?
It's getting very late.
Okay, I'll try to check with you later.
Goodbye, dear.
Thanks, Lieutenant.
Now, what's the matter?
Now you've got two reasons to face the coroner.
Yes?
But that's impossible! We've got that whole areas swarming with men!
Are you sure?
Right.
What is it? What happened?
This whole thing is cockeyed!
These are the three areas.
Logically then, the force should be in here.
But it isn't! He was just spotted at a meat-packing house, way out here.
Well, how did he get out of that area?
It's been covered by the police.
That's the sixty-four dollar question.
It's a distance of almost seven miles.
And nobody's seen him from there to there.
That's right.
Only two ways that this thing could get around.
Walking and flying, and he hasn't got wings.
Any normal person would hide out at a hotel or anyplace.
This is a white elephant. Any three-year-old child could spot him.
The question is, how does he cover seven miles without being seen?
Just an idea, Lieutenant, but I think
I've got something.
What is it?
- Storm drains.
- I don't get it.
Some of those openings are big enough for two men to crawl into.
You mean the catch basins?
I think you've got something there, doctor.
Get me the city engineer at his home.
What's the guy's name? Edwards, that's it. Edwards.
Department of Public Works is right around the corner.
So wake him up.
The drains in the sewer system of the city are a lot cooler than the external temperature.
I told you the creature had intuitive powers.
He could have sensed the colder temperature.
And that would explain why he was never seen from jump to jump.
Do you have a complete chart of the storm drains?
Lieutenant, there are forty-eight hundred miles of storm drains under this city.
We've got lots of charts.
How about the east end?
Yeah.
- Cigarette?
- No, thanks.
You know, doctor, if there are drains connecting these areas, we've got something to work on.
There we are, Lieutenant.
That's the area, right there.
Here are the stops, doctor, right along the drain lines.
- Can I take this with me?
- Yes.
Thanks, Edwards.
- Sorry to wake you.
- Oh, that's alright, Lieutenant.
Think nothing of it. Anything for the police department.
- ... looking out...
- Richards, get eight men. Issue the works.
Walkie-talkies, lamps, rubber boots, and so on.
Right, Lieutenant.
The first detail, we'll start here at Eleventh and Grand, near the warehouse.
The second at Coe Street, where the girl was found.
Coe.
Dr. Parrish, myself, and a couple officers will start here at the pharmacy.
The first detail will work to the north, second to the south...
... and we work eastward.
Plan within the hour that we should all meet right here.
- Got it?
- Check.
- Hurry it up.
- Alright, darling.
- Oh, Lieutenant, can we take a net along?
- Sure. Hey, Richards!
- Get a big net and some poles to go with it.
- Right.
And leave word where I'll be in case the hospital calls.
Yes, Lieutenant.
Let's go.
Just a minute.
Lynch?
- Lynch?
- 'Yes, Lieutenant.'
Can you make out anything?
'Not yet, Lieutenant.'
'Proceeding south, according to plan. Over.'
How about you, Roberts?
Anything happen at your end?
'Not yet, Lieutenant.'
Stay in contact.
Thanks to them for bringing the net.
We haven't got him yet, doctor.
Hold it!
Let me check this.
I never noticed that tunnel over there before.
It intersects this drain and empties into the main drain center.
You two take it.
We'll go this way.
There he is!
Look out!
He went up the tunnel a little bit.
Seems to be alright.
Now that we know he's in here, let's see where this tunnel leads to.
Let's see. We're at East Entrance 7.
It winds around and comes out
East Entrance 8.
We'll have them put the net up at East Entrance 8.
Right.
Lynch...
- Lynch!
- That you, Lieutenant?
Put the net up over East Entrance 8.
- Will do, Lieutenant.
- Right.
Loosen his collar and take him out into the main tunnel.
Nice shot, boy.
- We'll do as you say, doctor.
- Yeah.
I'll have Dr. Dupont give you instructions where to send the body.
'Come in, Car 61.'
Stand by.
- 'That you, Lieutenant?'
- Yeah, we just finished the job. What is it?
'Very urgent call. Proceed immediately to Crescent and Elm. Urgent. Over.'
Who gave that order?
Don't you know what time it is?
'I don't know, but there's a creature waiting for you.'
'Eight pounds, three ounces. A boy, Lieutenant.'
'Mother and son are doing fine.'
'Congratulations, Pop.'
Thanks a lot, Vince. Thanks a lot.
Thank you. Out.
Well, I guess that's it. Good luck.
- I guess I'd better be going.
- I guess you had!
Come on, doctor, I'll drop you off on the way.
Oh, no, no. You haven't got time.
Sure, I have. Come on.
Alright. My wife must be pretty worried by now.
Say, doctor. What's your first name?
Frank.
Maybe I'll name my kid Frank.
Frank Dunbar, it sounds great.
Thanks.
I don't know. I'm not too sure I like it.
What's that?
- Sounds like a jet, doesn't it?
- That's not jet.
Maggie!  Look!
- What is it?
- Down!  Get down.
Maggie!
Get inside, inside!
Inside!
Maggie!
I'm alright, Dad.
We saw it coming out of the sky, it was brilliant...
You two stay over there, and keep watch from the windows!
It's probably a meteor, isn't it?
I hope that's what it is.
Dad, don't go out there!
- You stay here, lad.
- Please, dad, don't go out!
Hang on now!  Is the telephone still on!  Call the police.
Will you all please return to your homes.
You're only hampering operations by crowding the streets.
Please return to your homes.
Please get back out of the road, on to the pavement please.
Come along now, please.
Please return to your homes.
Get back.
People in here.
Right back please.
Right back.
Keep clear!
Alright.
You'll be alright.
They'll take care of you.
Okay George, let's have a look at you.
Oh, don't you start fussing too.
I've got singed, that's all.
It's still too hot to put water on.
It could do with another pump.
It should be heavily green now.
What's all this about, chief?
It could be practically anything.
The object was first sighted at about 9:15 this evening.
And its approach was widely observed over the southern counties.
A statement just issued by the home office, stresses that there is no general danger.
Members of the public however are warned to stay away from the area.
I will repeat that.
The Home Office stresses that there is no immediate danger.
Do you realize what you'll have to face if this turns out to be a disaster, Quatermass.
- How much further?
- 150 miles, sir.
Quatermass, I'm talking to you!
For the last 20 miles I've been painfully aware of that.
Well that answered that.  How did it happen?  What went wrong?
For the first time in the history of the world, man has sent a rocket
1500 miles into space.
You can't expect such an experiment to be perfect.
Well, you must have had some ideas.
I'm a scientist, not a fortune-teller who predicts what will happen.
- Well you had instrument, radio contact.
- We lost it for over 57 hours. sir.
Poor old Glooseman don't even know how far it's been.
It had no further contact even when it return to the orbit.
Yet you brought it down by your own control.
Well, that's something to tell your ministry.
Create a mess, set it up and he brought it back.
Please!  Oh, please.
Couldn't you pick some other time for this.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Carroon.
I happened to be concerned with the Ministry of Defense.
And I'm not a civil servant, I'm a doctor.
And I happened to be concerned with 3 men.  The 3 men who are in that rocket.
Oakley, Green, this is it?
Certainly no secret.
Sorry, no one's allowed past this point.
Ministry of Defense.
Oh, yes, sir.
Alright there, open up.
Sorry Miss, you will have to keep back.
Hoi, Miss!
Hey, you have to get back, please!
Miss!
Hi Ike, chasing the girls again.
Aye, you'd think it bank holiday the way they come flocking out.
I'd like to flock home.
You stay put, my lad, until that thing cools off.
Or blows up.
Now don't start that story going around.  I said it's not a bomb.
- So why can't we put water on it?
- Listen, Charlie. We've had instructions.
Don't ask me why because I didn't tell us.
Hey, hey.  Just a minute!
- Mr Blake, Ministry of Defense!
- I'll get the inspector.
- Try and get through to them Marsh.
- Right, sir.
Get the temperature reading.
Why don't you go and wait in the car, Judith?
It's funny.
It looks exactly the same.
Yet it's been, who knows how far.
There isn't a word.
Hello Q-1, hello.
Q-1, Q-1, This is Marsh.
Hello Carroon, Green, Reichenheim.
You receive me?  Over.
Keep trying.
- Mr. Blake?
- I'm Quatermass.
I'll be in charge from here on inspector.
Can't say I'm sorry about that.  What's the next move?
We can't do anything right now.
Not until that cools off.
- How long left is that?
- I would say 3 or 4 hours at least.
Q-1, Q-1, this is Marsh.
Can you hear me?  Over.
You keeping them there for four hours?
I suppose you'd like me to open it up right now, huh?
One blast of air in against that heat will incinerate them.
Sir, reporters have arrived.
They'd like some facts.
- They'll get some later.
- They'll get some now. Bring them on Major.
Don't you think we ought to find out a few more ourselves first?
Bring them on, Major.
Are you hearing me Q-1?
Are you hearing me?
This is Marsh calling Q-1.
Q-1, over.
You know, if I ever gave them all the facts, you'd find one or two of them difficult to explain.
Don't try and drag me through the mud, Blake, you might splash a little bit on yourself, you and your committee.
You deliberately launched that rocket without waiting for official sanction.
If the whole world waited for official sanction, it would be standing still.
You took too long.
- I made my own decision.
- To gamble with 3 men's lives!
Every experiment is a gamble.
The unknown is always a risk.
- They should know that.
- Did she know that?
That woman over there waiting, hoping and praying?
It dropped another 100 degrees since we arrived.
We still got a long way to go.
Let's hope that insulation lining doesn't crack up.
Yes, let's hope it didn't.
Because if it did, Quatermass and those 3 men in there are dead...
Dead or alive they'll be heroes.
Let me tell you something, Blake.
They'll fire the imagination so that there'll be a 100 men begging for the same privilege when we launch the second rocket.
- You can't stop it now.
- You mean I can't stop you now.
That's right.
This is Marsh calling Q-1.
Do you hear me?  Over.
There's nothing, sir.
Nothing Quatermass.
You know what you've done.
I launched it and I brought it back, that's quite an achievement, I think.
- And those 3 men ...
- Quiet!
- What is it, Marsh?
- Something came through.
Pull up. Brian pull up.
The tapping coming from inside.
By the hull, near the transmitter.
Q-1, Q-1.
Green, Reichenheim,
Carroon.  This is Quatermass.
We can hear you, can you hear us?
Over.
Q-1, Q-1, can you hear me?
You've landed in England.
We are here not 50 yards from you.
Are you all right?   Over.
Tapping has stopped.
We can't wait.  We've got to get them out of there now.
- Bring me the fire chief.
- Right away. sir.
- Set the remote control.
- Are you mad?
Do you know what will happen if we have no rocket door now?
We've got to take that risk.  We know one of them is alive in there.
In an hour, he may not be.
But you said that would incinerate them.  You can't do a thing like that!
Don't tell me what I can do, what I can't do.
That shell temperature is still 300 degrees.
Alright.  What would you suggest?
Wait till it's absolutely safe and then bring him out dead?
- Door control set, sir.
- Hold it.
Where's that fire chief?
Get an ambulance move in.
You want me, sir?
Yes.  Round up every man and piece of machinery you've got.
Move it in there as close as possible.
We're gonna open the rocket door from here by remote control.
When the door opens, when I give you the signal.
I want every hose turned full force around that entrance.
Now you got it?
Oh, that thing's still as hot as the base, I don't know.
If you start pumping water ...
Don't argue with me.
I know what I'm doing.
I hope so, sir.
- Major.
- Sir.
I want this whole field cleared.
When they come out of the rocket,
I want absolutely no one on the field.
Do you understand?
No one.
Don't worry, sir.
There's someone alive in there.
We don't know what condition they'll be.
So you better get everything out.
Oxygen, morphine, glucose ...
Well, now it's up to you.
Keep your eye on me.
I'll give you the signal.
- All set?
- Set, sir.
Start it up.
Let me know when you're minus 10 the pressure.
Right, sir.
Minus ten
Nine
Eight
Seven
Six
Five
Four
Three
Two
One
Zero.
Turn off the water.
- It's Mr Carroon.
- Victor!
- Victor, darling!
- Get them into the ambulance!
- What about the others?
- Darling.
Green! Reichenheim!
What happened son?
The access chamber, there's more inside.
Quick, the manual control.
Where are the others?
This thing works?
It's free, sir.
- They are not there.
- Not there.  What do you mean not there?
I mean they're not in the rocket, either one of them.
- Oh, that's impossible. They must be!
- He's right, sir.  They're gone.
- The pressure suits?
- Empty.
Still linked.  Helmets are still attached but they're empty.
How the hell could they possibly have gone out?
If I knew that I wouldn't be wasting my time trying to find out.
Go bring the camera down.
Do you think the door opened and they were swept away?
If the door had opened it'd be registered here.
No, that door has not been opened, till now.
What are you just trying to tell me?
I'm not trying to tell you anything.
Let the camera do that.
I'm afraid the camera can't tell us anything.
Are they all right?
Something happened.
They're not there.
Victor!
Where is Green?
Where's Reichenheim?
- What happened?
- Please, not now.
Quatermass!
He is in no condition to talk.
He's in truth still in a state of shock!
He must be treated.
He's got to talk first.  He's got to tell me what happened!
Gordon!
What is it Victor?
What is it?
He said "help me".
That's all he said.
"Help me".
SPACE ROCKET :
SCIENTIFIC EXPERIMENT SUCCESSFUL
ROCKET LANDS AT NIGHT IN THE COUNTRYSIDE
WHY THE SECRECY?
QUATERMASS:
NO TO A POLICE INVESTIGATION
METROPOLITAN POLICE
FORENSIC LABORATORY
- You get it?
- Yes, sir.
Good.
Alright, so he's just making any ... but he got a lump state with the wife.
Any special reason?
Uh huh, my favourite day of the month.
Payday.
Oh, I'm a big man on payday.
Yes, sir.
- See the papers?
- Quatermass?
Still to get up for the police.
How dare he take fingerprints from a sick man?
There's nothing else they could do?
He couldn't talk, couldn't answer any questions.
Thought it would be might as well get his prints.
You never know.
No, you never know.
He's a weird one, alright.
Skin it ... just like shaking hands with a piece of ice.
Sergeant, that's no way to talk about a public hero.
Come in.
A Mr Quatermass to see you, sir.
Well, speaking of public heroes.
- Alright, bring him in..
- Yes, sir.
Quatermass, heh?
This is what's known as penetrating into enemy territory.
- Inspector Lomax.
- I'm Lomax.
This is Sergeant Best.
Won't you sit down?
I'll come direct to the point, Inspector.
I will not have your men coming into my research center and treating Victor Carroon as though he were a pathological criminal.
- No, he ...
- He's a sick man, Inspector.
He's been through an ordeal that very few man could survive.
Two men didn't survive it, did they Mr Quatermass?
What exactly do you mean by that?
I wish you'd sit down.
If I sit and you stand, I'm being rude.  I'm longing to sit down.
You see, Mr Quatermass,
I'm an old-fashion sort of chap.
I don't know much about rockets or travelling in space.
I don't read science fiction,
I'm a plain simple bible man.
I have a routine mind, and
I have to do routine things.
Such as fingerprinting an unconscious man.
When 3 men take off in a rocket and only one comes back in our reckoning that leaves minus 2.
And minus 2 puts us in an embarrassing position having to investigate plus 1.
Now whether he is conscious, unconscious or a gibbering idiot.
Fine.  I guess that can save you a lot of time, Inspector with your so called investigation.
I have here, the particulars on all 3 members of the crew.
Charles Green, Ludwig
Reichenheim, Victor Carroon.
You'll find everything there, Inspector.
Medical histories, personal descriptions, academic achievements, professional activities, politics and even fingerprints.
Well, that is very thoughtful of you.
There is only one investigation likely to serve any good purpose in this situation, Inspector.
That's the scientific one.
I'm sure even you will agree, that between us,
I am the best qualified for that assignment.
Good day, Inspector, Sergeant.
Well, we might all well say we've been given a ride.
Yes, sir.
It's absolutely unbelievable.
It just isn't clinically possible that his heart should just pump like this.
Pulse, blood pressure the same.
Impossibly low.
He shouldn't be alive but he is.
Can't you do something to increase the metabolic rate?
Tried everything.
No effect.
I never knew pressure effects to last this long.
Well, these aren't just pressure effects.
Take a look at his face, take a look at the skin.
Anyway, here on the shoulder.
Feel it.
Swollen, coarsened.
Yes, and that's not all either.
Look at the contour of the face.
You mean the bone structure?
Yes, it could be rather limp, but not about the shape of the bones.
There's been a change,
I'm convinced of that.
Is he any better?
He's coming along fine.
If only he'd say something.
Give us a sign that he's thinking, that he knows we're here.
He knows, Judith.
He knows we're trying to help him.
What is happening to him?
Well, that's what we're trying to find out.
Shouldn't he be in a hospital?
- That's exactly where he should be.
- Briscoe!
I can't take this responsibility any longer.
I haven't got the proper equipment here to do the right tests.
He belongs in a hospital.
Well, I suppose you're right.
I suppose you're both right.
He does belong in a hospital.
But can a hospital do more than you can do?
Would a hospital know what goes on out there in space?
On the other side of the earth, it's a whole new would out there.
A wilderness, uncharted.
And he's been there and come back.
He's got the map.
Unlock his mind for me, Briscoe, and find it.  I know you can do it.
It isn't just the ...
I know the strain and tension you've been under.
But to stop now, when we're so close.
On the brink of something tremendous.
The very fringe of some great discovery.
We can't stop now, Briscoe.
Besides, it's our only chance to learn what happened to the others.
At the hospital you have almost  ...
Does the hospital know how to deal with a man who's been exposed to rocket radiation?
- It is that she knows that ...
- Or the effects of pressure at 1500 miles up?
During flight training it took 7 times the force of gravity without even a headache.
We know that.
But would a hospital know it?
Well, I'll try another transfusion, see if that will help.
Thanks.
You'll stay with him, won't you Judith?
He needs you.
Victor.
I am going to move him into the office.
We can make him more comfortable in there.
- Would you help me, please?
- Of course.
Thank you for all you're doing, Gordon.
Aye, I only wish I could do more.
The solution is elementary, my dear Inspector.
Victor Carroon killed the two men, removed their pressure suits, pushed their bodies out into space and then linked the suits together again.
- Now, what do you want?
- Two things.
Number 1, I want to return these files.
Green, Reichenheim, Carroon.
- Very interesting. Carroon ...
- Number 2?
Well, I want you to give me your solemn word...
Well Inspector, I'm a very busy man.
Now look sir, nobody ever wins a cold war.
One of us must come over to the other side.
You don't want to come over to mine.
I'm not proud, I'll come over to yours.
Solemn word about what?
That these were Carroon's fingerprints.
Of course they were.
Everybody in ... gets fingerprinted.
What are you getting at?
Ahh, to be quite honest,
I don't quite know, sir.
Nothing unusual about these.
These are the fingerprints we took off Carroon last night.
What about them?
Compare them.
- Is this a joke?
- This is no joke, sir.
The man who took those had his training in the fingerprint section, second nature to him.
But these prints aren't even ... human.
Yes. Yeah.
You found what?
I'll be right there.
Well, wherever you're going, I might as well keep you company, mightn't I?
Thank you.
Very nice of you.
Mr Lionel has checked the specification of the wiring.
Right there.
Can you get at it?
No.
It's right in a crevice.
Hand me the samples spoon in that box.
Any more of it?
Yes sir, lots.
On the left, by the rivet there.
Mind if we have a sample for our people?
Sure, we'll give you a sample.
Briscoe, what do you think it is?
I do not know a thing, I'm not sure.
I've been in this thing all night.
I smell there's such thing around the whole town.
Can I have that lamp?
You got the same bright thoughts that I have?
Something happened in here.
Something beyond our understanding at the moment.
If I only knew where to begin.
- Maybe the film will help?
- Film?
Guess the lab should have developed it by now.
I thought you told me the camera was smashed.
It was rather damaged but
I managed to get the film out.
Why didn't you tell me?
The lab said they didn't know if they could develop it or not.
They've got to develop it.
You get right down to that laboratory and tell them they've got to develop that film!
- Yes, sir.
- And I'll have no delays or excuses!
Tell them to get the best process man in the company!
Tell them to get anybody they want, but I've got to have that film.
Right, sir.
This is one frankly
I don't want to miss.
Well?
It's harmless, it's organic, it's jelly.
End of analysis.
No definite identification?
It might conceivably represent the dead remnants of cell tissue.
- What sort of cell tissue?
- Could be animal, could be human.
- Human?
- Could have been.
- Do you know what you're saying?
- I know what I'm thinking.
Are you sure it's not some sort of plant cell?
Positive.
You mean to say that you're asking me to believe that that is the remains of two human beings?
I'm not asking you to believe anything.
You asked a question, I answered it.
Does she know?
No, it's the best sleep she's had in nights.
What about the police analyst?
What do they say?
No report through yet.
But I don't doubt it will be the same.
It's almost beyond human understanding.
Some fantastic invisible force ... converted two men into ... jelly.
- Is that the slide?
- That's the slide.
I'm about to call it a day, Quatermass.
- Beyond this I'm a ...
- Gordon!
Alright, get him up.
No, wait a minute.
His hand, another change.
Get him back to bed.
Look what's happening to his skin in just the last few moments.
I'll go and get him a sedative.
You've done it to him.
He'd been better off if he'd been killed and stayed out there.
Judith!
You've destroyed him like you destroyed everything else you've touched.
Destroyed him?
I've brought him back, I've saved him!
Saved him for what?
For further experiments?
I can help him more than you or anyone else can.
There's no room for personal feelings in science, Judith.
Some of us have a mission.
You should be very proud to have a husband who's willing to risk his life for the betterment of the whole world.
What world?  Your world?
The world of Quatermass!
I have sent for an ambulance.
He's going to the Central Clinic.
Alright Briscoe.
Send them to the clinic.
But I want them to have complete isolation, you understand.
Complete isolation.
No one is to see them.
No one, until I say so.
We've tried three different grade of stock, developed each one to its higher gamma as possible and still it's made no difference.
- Look at this.  It's grainy and dark.
- All I want is a print!
Well, we don't like any print that isn't up to standard.
Is there a picture of it?
Oh, there's a picture alright.
But you can see how dull and grainy ...
I don't care how dull and grainy it is.   I must have this now.
It could be altitude, or an extreme change of temperature, or penetration of cosmic rays.
Fine, fine.
I'll tell him that.
Well, I don't know what the old man will say.
Listen, you tell your old man that our old man says if he didn't get this print he'd dynamite the building.
I can't tell the Ministry this.
They'll think I lost my senses.
That's exactly why you must tell them nothing.
Now you see why I must have absolute authority to isolate Carroon.
But every newspaper in town has got a story on him being admitted into the clinic.
They'll want to know why and what's happened to him on what's happened to the others.
- Alright, do you want to tell him?
- But not telling them won't stop the panic.
What they don't know won't start a panic.
- Inspector, what about the police analysis?
- The same, Mr Blake.
Well, what's the next move?
Oh, we've agreed to isolation.  There isn't anything we can do until we know more.
Yeah?
The film is ready.
- See that Marsh, it works!
- Yes, sir.
- What works?
- Automatic prism.
It touch on the panel reading.
What?  Is that all?
Once in the observation zone, the camera's geared to cut out at regular intervals.
This will be at 0.160.
That must be where we lost them.
What the hell could have happened?
Look at that fantastic temperature drop.
Run it again.
He's in surgery.
But I'll get word to him as soon as possible.
Yes, what's the name, please?
That's two T's?
Yes, I'll see that he gets it.
Yes.
Sorry, miss, the visiting hours are over.
I just wanted to know how my husband is.
I'll try and find out for you, miss.
- What would the name be?
- Carroon, Victor Carroon.
- Oh.
- He's alright, isn't he?
Mrs Carroon, I wish I could let you go up, but we have strict
- orders about your husband.
- All I want to know is how is he?
Is there any change?
Just a minute.
Hello Mabel?
Listen, how is 4B?
I know about the orders, but
I only want you to think out loud.
Thank you, Mabel.
Thank you.
Still about the same, Mrs Carroon, no change but no worse.
If I could see him, just for a few minutes.
I should be shot at dawn.
- But don't you worry. He's in good hands.
- They don't leave him alone, do they?
Ooh, not for a moment.
Tucker, his night nurse is with him now and Perkins comes on in about half an hour.
- The fella is good as any doctor.
- Could I wait for the night nurse when he comes off duty.
If only to talk to someone who has been with him.   Please.
Tucker comes off in about half an hour.
He usually dips out through the staff entrance.
Turn left through the doors and it's on the right.
- Thank you.
- Wait for him outside.
And if the ask me,
I never told you nothing.
There's only the nurse with him.  His name's Tucker.
His name?  You mean
I got to plan for the "he"?
Please hurry.  You've only got half and hour before the relief nurse comes on duty.
- Another one in pants?
- His name's Perkins.
Have you got any money?
Cash before delivery, it always gives me more confidence.
Especially when I'm investigating is this type ...
- Room 4B.
- 4B.
Give me 15 minutes.
I'll put him in the lift and standing by.  Then he's all yours.
- I never saw you in my ...
- Please hurry.  He's very sick.
Don't worry I'll murder him like a baby.
You've got to get it.
Relax lady, you're shaking the building.
- Good evening.
- Yes.
Evening.  I'm from casualty.
Perkins is sick.
They sent me to take over his night shift.
Fine, I don't know in two hours, but you're not until for another half hour!
Who cares?  Night shift is night shift.
What's a half an hour you got there.
You know you go to heaven for this.
With our rate of pay, we should get some fun out of life.
- What's his trouble?
- Doesn't seem to know.
He's the star patient.
He just lies and stares.
Never opens his mouth.  But if he does, press that bell and quick.
Well, happy nightmare.
- Any special instructions?
- It's all on the chart.
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.
News my friend.
Your wife is waiting for you downstairs.
I'm the man who's gonna get you out of here.
Does that make you happy?
It does.
Good!
Now we don't have too much time, so up we get.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- What time are you off?
- Ask him whether he's going to live or not.
- Operating?
- About three and a half hours at least.
- You too?
- Me too.
Chinese restaurants open until midnight.
Take your vote.
Beautiful sweet and sour pork,
- roast duck, fried shrimps.
- You talked us into it.
Here we are, now the jacket.
That's a good boy.
Can't meet the lady looking sloppy.
You know it's funny, wives usually employ me to get them away from their husbands.
Oh, you're a sad one!
Well, to each his own.
Hey, steady, steady.
Now you stay here while Christie goes and get the lift.  Won't be a minute.
All clear.
Hey, come on, hurry.
That's the boy.  Christie's got you.
What have you got there?
What are you hiding?
What is it?
Victor.
Oh Victor, darling.
I've got the car outside.
Please try and be quick.
You can make it dear.
Everything's going to be alright, Victor.
I'll get you the best treatment, the finest doctors.
I'll get you well and strong.
We'll make a new life for ourselves.
Away from all this.
Away from him.
Our life will be our own.
Would you like one?
Victor, I ...
Victor.
Your hand.
Are you in pain?
Well, this is one case I don't think we'll find listed in forensic medicine.
It looks as though the life was drawn right out of him.
Have the body examined by a head pathologist.
I'd like a report as soon as possible.
The headlines ... pathologist also took a little beep.
I don't care if he dumps his head into a ring.
They picked up Mrs Carroon the other side of town. Car full of luggage.
- And Carroon?
- No sign of him.
Stupid idiot.  Trying to take the whole thing in her own hands.
- What did he go?  What did she say?
- She didn't say anything.
Anything about him.  She's in a pretty bad state of shock.
If not about him, then about what?
The doctor said she may even go out of her mind.
Out of her mind about what?  What did she say?  Come on, talk man.
Well, when they found her, she was just sitting at the wheel of a car.
And moaning, something about a hand being all grey with thorns like a ... like a cactus.
I remember there was a cactus in this room, in this pot.
- Can I get a line to this?
- Yes
Hello?
Hello.
Henry's coming down.
 Car-three-nine
Proceed immediately to 34 Main Elm Street ...
 and investigate a complaint by resident
maybe Carroon.
Proceed with caution car-three-nine.
Cars ....
join river police at Hayes Wharf
to search area bounded by .... and Tilly street.
River Patrol 4.

Street, Hayes Lane and Strat Temps
 River Patrol 4.
Roger.  Out.
This growth on the face.
Half plant, half ...
Look at this.
Look what it's done.  The whole tissue structure's eaten away.
The bones, powder.
Well, that takes care of my supper tonight.
Briscoe, what if there is a form of life in space?
Not on some planet, but just drifting.
I don't know.
Not life, as we know it.
With intelligence, yes, but pure energy, with no organic structure.
- Invisible.
- Invisible?
Now the rocket past through its path.
It entered the rocket.  It found living specimens of our form of life.
- Cell organisms.  Human.
- Green and Reichenheim.
And Carroon.
Exactly.
Now, if even by accident it could enter one of those structures.
What a way to invade the Earth.
Now look sir, I'm not over intelligent, but when you ...
You saw the film, you know what happened.
Only God knows where and how far that rocket traveled.
- But only two of them died.
- Something got into that rocket!
Took the blood out of the other two and now it's using Carroon.
And it's found other forms of life, the cactus.
- Good grief.  You mean Carroon's ...
- a carrier.
He is now another shell of a man being transformed.
If all these cactus plants were subject to the same mutation there could be an affinity, a union between plant and animal with the ability to destroy, and possess and multiply... at will.
Multiply?
Yes, but to multiply, first it has to live.
And like any living thing, to live, it must have food.
I'm sorry, we're closed.
Alright, just a minute.
We only open until ...
Hey, wait a minute!
You can't come into a place like this!
Leave those things alone!
What do you think you're doing?
Are you in pain?
Is it something to do with your arm?
Look, I'll just take a look.
I won't hurt it, I promise.
No!
Alright love, I'll get it.
Hello?
Yes, Best.
What?
When?
Right.  Cordon off the whole area.
Tell Quatermass and
Briscoe to meet us there.
Love!
- Now what?
- I've got to go back.
- But you just come in.
- They just can't do without me, love.
I don't know why you don't move into the office.
You'd never believe I was there.
What makes you think I do now?
- Have your tea at least.
- Haven't got time, love.
The thing that you do to that poor stomach of yours.
I ought to get you a picnic basket.
What I'm going on is no picnic.
- What about dinner?
- Cook and keep your fingers crossed.
Bye love.
- What do you think he was trying to do?
- I'd like to think, kill himself.
You see if mix the normal of that, it will be death in 5 minutes.
What?  What is it?
I have a bit of sick feeling it was something to speed up the change going on inside him.
But Carroon was an engineer, he doesn't know anything about chemistry.
Carroon didn't know.
There is a kettle still on and there's no sign of the chemist anywhere.
What do you think he was doing here?
- Well, one thing he was doing ...
- We're not certain.
Not certain about anything with this customer.
Well?
Nobody in the street heard anything.
They're all in church or in the local.
He must have ...
Evans, come in quick, and quiet.
Here we are.
And it's just the two of us today.
We'll have our own tea-party.
I don't like those other girls anyway.
All they do is talk about their new clothes and dolls.
You don't care about those things, do you?
You don't care about new clothes or anything.
We're friends.
Now you sit down and be a good girl while I make the tea.
There's a teapot, there's a cup.
And I brought the most delicious cakes and biscuits.
The others never serve anything, but we do.
Look, I'm pretty yummy.
Don't be frightened, that's only the old rats living in this old boat.
Now, tea is ready.
Sugar?  One?
Two, alright.
Now you may have a cake.
This one is filled with cherries.
But anyway, I like that one cause it's full of chocolate.
Ooh, we thought you were a rat.
Won't you stay and have tea with us?
We'd very much like you to stay.
You look so tired.
There's plenty, if that's what you're worried about.
And cakes too.
Go on dolly, you ask him.
Please, won't you have tea and cakes with us?
Don't be frightened, we would like you to stay very much.
And you may have the cake that has all the chocolate inside.
Tell him, dolly.
Yes.
What time was this?
Was it an eye-witness?
I see.
Well, he's been doing fine.
He's been positively seen in Liverpool,
Margate, Ostend and the Orkneys.
Yes.
- Yes.  Deptford area.
- What?
A kid told her mother ...
Yes?
About two hours ago?
Hold it please.
The kid got a doll broken by a man down by some derelict boat near Deptford.
Oh, so it had to be Carroon?
No, the mother's complaining about molesting kids.
Deptford said the description could fit Carroon.
All right.  Well, that's why there's a police station at Deptford.
Thank you Deptford.
Keep us informed.
Bye bye.
A Deptford alert on Carroon.
Yes, I know it is, so your boys can have another little drive.
Cover derelict boats, warehouses and bomb shelters.
Alright, so do it again.
Where is he getting food, that's what I'd like to know?
Now, now shut up, Simba!
Time to go to bed.
Go on.  Off you go. Go on.
Don't stand there gaping at me.
Off you go to bed!
Goodnight fellas.
Sleep well.
Hello, Joey.
You know something?
Could have sworn I saw you having tea in a cafe this afternoon.
Turns out to be a customer though.
TO LION HOUSE
This is exactly as the keeper found him when he came on duty.
- Are the others the same?
- Yes, over here.
They found three more still outside the antelope house, or what was left of them.
Look.
Look at that.
- Complete absorption this time.
- That's what I've been afraid of.
Inspector, get this place closed, get everybody out of here.
- Right.
- Quickly and quietly as possible.
No panic, no charging.
Close the whole place up?
As we already ...
Listen, sir, you've got to take it from us.  We know what we are doing.
Just tell your men to cooperate, please.
Well, I don't understand what's happening, anyway.
What killed these animals?
- You better say natural causes for now.
- What?
Sorry, ma'am we're closed this morning.
Closed, but we've come all the way from Epping.
Sorry ma'am.  We're not to open to the public this morning.
- Will it be opened this afternoon?
- Oh, I wish I could tell you, sir.
Sorry folks, still closed.
I'm very sorry now, but we're closed this morning.
I'm very sorry, sir.
Quatermass!
Inspector!
What is it?
He was here .
Look at this.
It's alive.
- Looks pretty horrible doesn't it?
- Quick, the sample box!
Well, what manner or a shape of thing do we look for now?
You'll know it when you see it.
Just send your men out with a prayer that we find it in time.
It's almost too terrifying to think about it.
In less than 12 minutes every animal completely absorbed pray except one.
Gone like quicksand.
But this quicksand knows what it's doing.
It's trebled it's size in an hour.
Do you know what this means?
This is only a fragment of the main organism.
If the same thing is happening to him at the same rate or speed, if absorbing those mice could do this ...
I know.
There is no living thing on earth that stands a chance against it.
How do we fight it, how do we stop it?
Hands off, you young man!
Fix him and then I come here on my own accord.
Yes, yes.
I come here to complain about something which I saw.
Okay Rosie, you keep saying now ...
I refuse to talk about it to any common constable ... who has nothing comes to do all day but show me big flat fleet.
Only big fat fleet.
Now, come on, Rosie old girl.
Don't you ... call me!
I mean I'm enough to be your mother.
What respectable woman in
London would be ... now?
I come in here of my own free will.
I come come here on my own volich ... volition.
Very glad we all to see you, Rosie.
- What can we do for you this time?
- I wish to make a report.
Miss Rosemary...
Elizabeth Wrigley.
- What address this week?
- I'm temporarily visiting.
- Bow Street?
- With friends.
Salvation Army.
The embankment.
What did you see this time, Rosie?
Oh, it was terrible.
Shocking.
It always is, Rosie.
Just tell me what you saw?
Of course it's been of a thing of a young woman can't walk the streets in London with that creepy crawly thing up in around that place.
What is the police for, if not for protect us from the likes of that?
Go on.  Tell me.  Tell me what's the police force for?
- Rosie!
- Yes?
Rosie, just tell me what you saw, and we at the London Metropolitan
Police will do all in our power to see that it doesn't occur again.
You were with voice wreck so drunk, that I couldn't even yell for a copper.
I still got this sore of this.
Why is it aren't to remember.
And water makes me as sick as a baby.
It better be worthwhile, Rosie.
After you tell me.
I was sitting in a door right here.
I wasn't feeling too well.
And the doctor says that too much walking is bad for my legs.
- It's my legs you see.
- You were sitting in the door way.
Yeah, just for a minute or two.
When suddenly I heard a ... kind of rustling it was.
Rustling?
So I looked.
And there, at the end of the street, I saw something moved.
Something enormous!
What moved Rosie?
Well, I couldn't make out the shape properly.
I usually might get the shapes of these things.
Think carefully, Rosie.
Was it ...?
This something, was it walking quickly or slowly?
Walking?
It was kind of crawling, up on the wall.
Not like any of the things that
I'll see on a Saturday nights.
No Rosie, I think this time you really saw it.
Get me the Yard.
Well cancel it.  This is priority.
Really saw it?  You mean this time it's not hallu... ?
- It's not a gin goblin?
- No, Rosie.  This time it was real.
Real?
It's my legs!
Hello, Scotland Yard.
Yes. Inspector Lomax, please.
Lomax here.
Yes.
Say that again.
Contact the Commissioner right away.
Hello?
Yes.
Yes.
We'll be right there.
Lomax.
Said it climbed a brick wall 30 feet high.
Yes, no doubt at all he was here.
Quite recently too.
The trail ends on the wall.
Let me have that case up here!
Get him his case, Sergeant.
Send the car in please.
Use the car radio.
I want to cordon off the entire area and evacuate all public.
Tell Evan and Mason to check on every movement that is likely to take place inside this radius tonight.
Yes sir.
Warn everyone not to touch anything unusual they may find in the streets or their gardens.
Warn the children, especially.
It got out?
Look at the size of it now!
Without food except mice.
Is it dead?
Yes, but don't touch it.
Look at these phalanges, spore producing patches.
If the limbs complete this reproductive cycle, this would have been a jungle of living tendrils.
How many more of these things are there around London?
I think you better call Lomax.
It's not a question of how many but where are they?
If they can reproduce at this rate, another 24 hours, a few days...
Get me Scotland Yard quickly.
What's project ...
Project had reached the mice.
Yes
Yes, of course.
The Commissioner.
- They're getting him, sir.
- Right.
Get hold of Evans.
I want him to get out an anti-panic statement.
I want it broadcast, televised and fill in all the nationals.
Yes, sir.
I want every available man on search of the area.
Immediate search of parks, fields, undergrounds and subways.
Yes sir, it's the
Quatermass Experiment.
I am please enough to take advance top level sir.
I need troops and the civil defense.
Yes sir, I'll be right out.
Now this is all we need to start the program with a swing.
What's he talking about?
Oh, no one must touch anything unusual we find on the streets.
Don't panic.  Just inform the nearest police station.
They've been putting that out all day on the radio.
Westminster Abbey.
Yes
Standing by.
Opening announcement coming up.
Okay, standby cameras.
Alright Camera 1, titles are in.
We will be on you in five seconds. four, three, two, one.
Oh, you Camera 1, where are you?
Alright quick, take over Camera 2.
On you instead.
What is that?
- What's happened?
- Looks like a body.
Kill transmission.
Landrow, fill in will you?
I'll get back as soon as possible.
Tell presentations.
Hello?
What's going on here?
- He fell from the scaffold.
- Slipped?
- Dead before he fell.
- Dead before he fell?
Sir, I should believe you have a strong stomach.
- He is ... practically a skull.
- I think we better get the police.
Yes, get the police.
Well, do we go on with the program?
- It's up to you sir.
- I'm alright.
I think we better carry on in another part of the abbey.
Pull that dolly over here, will you?
Get a blanket or something to cover him up.
Come on.  Quickly.
- Mr Quatermass.
- Right.
Alright, I want the whole abbey cleared.
Public, clergy, everyone and quick.
Please, not so loud.
There's a transmission going on.
Well, the transmission's coming off.
I want you all out of this place.
Every second may count.
... spend time for the cameras only.
This is highly out of range.
Well, son, it's is an emergency.
Get this stopped.
Stop?  I can't stop it!
- Where's your producers?
- They're in the truck.
These murals were hidden under layers of painting and aged by the dust of time.
Where the other reinforcements!
Steve on Camera 2 standby on stained glass window.
Camera 3 on scaffolding hold it.
I'm Inspector Lomax.  You got to get your people out of the abbey!
Please.
Coming on to you Camera 3.
Everyone in that building maybe in deadly danger!
We're on transmission!
Back on to you Camera 1.
Pan up as high as you can and ...
What's in the name of it?
It must be 20 feet across.
Kill transmission.
Camera 1, hold that shot and log off and everybody out!
Hello, hello, listen.
Jessica, you'll just have to carry on as best you can, we can't go on here.
Yes, just fill in will you?
Quatermass, quick, in the front.
It's now in the abbey.
We have to strike it now, uh?
At the abbey.
There is an emergency.
You saw it?
We don't know what it is.
Same pattern as the one in the lab.
And it was 20 times the power of reproduction.
Its nodules if it get to spore this time, nothing will stop them.
It'll break up, they'll spread by the million wherever there's having wind.
How long before it starts reproducing?
It's on the last cycle,
80 or 90 minutes.
And within the hours, everyone will be a million.
He's coming lower!
- We've got to stop him!
- You need a miracle to stop it now.
- We've got flame throwers.
- Well, it managed to escape, the whole of it is to kill.
- Dynamite.
- That would only spread it further.
Stopped moving!
It's barely pulsating now.
That time it was out, it's its last dormant stage just before it reproduces.
It's changing again.
The beginning of new spore producing hands, dusting.
Well, it's hanging there, grabbed on the scaffolding.
Briscoe, I think we can stop it.
What now, Professor?
That scaffold inside,
I want to run cables to it.
Then tap the main power line.
I want to send enough current into that steel to burn it up.
We've got to keep pouring current into it.
We have to melt it right down to the ground.
It's our only chance.  I want every set of current in London diverted to here.
This will bring the city to a standstill.
If that thing spores before we kill it, you won't have any city!
I just hope you're right, that's alright.  Just hope you're right!
Attention everybody.
There is no cause for alarm.
I repeat.
There is no cause for alarm.
Please do not crowd.
Unless you have official business in this vicinity,
Please listeners, go back to your homes.
There is nothing to see, go back to your homes.
Hello Battlesea.  Standby.
Switch on.
Well, this time you won.
In my simple bible way,
I did a lot of praying.
One world at a time is good enough for me.
Can we ease it all up now, sir?
Is it all right, sir?
Quatermass, why wasn't
I informed about all this?
I only just heard, sir.
Could have been here sooner.
Is there anything I can do?
- Yes, Marsh.  Gonna need some help.
- Help, sir?  What are you gonna do?
I'm gonna start again.
GODZILLA RAIDS AGAIN
Base, Base, this is airplane Keichi calling.
I am at 136 degrees east, 34 degrees north, making my final pass over the sea. Over.
Airplane Keichi, airplane Keichi, this is base. Roger, roger.
You have made your final pass over the fishing lanes, over.
Roger, roger. This is airplane Keichi reporting.
Base, Base, this is airplane Keichi reporting.
I've made my third pass. How are things? Over.
Roger, roger. Don't you have anything else to say?
Hidemi, are you going somewhere tonight?
Roger, Roger. I should be available tomorrow.
We can use my papa's car.
Hidemi, it must be nice to be the boss's daughter.
Patience, Patience.
You'll get lucky soon.
Until I do, tell me everything!
You can put money on it!
Base, Base! This is Kobayashi, Kobayashi!
I'm having engine trouble. I have engine trouble.
Kobayashi, Kobayashi, this is base.
Do you know what it is? Do you know what it is?
It happened while passing the southern islands.
Oh, my engine has stalled.
Engine stall! Engine stall! I'm going down!
Kobayashi! Kobayashi! Respond!
Kobayashi! Kobayashi!
Emergency! Emergency! Kobayashi's plane is going down. We need you to assist him!
What? Kobayashi?
Roger, Roger.
I'll start looking for him right away!
Papa!
- What? You shouldn't barge in here!
Kobayashi's plane has gone down
- What? What did you say?
HEY! HEY! HEY!
Hey! Hey!
Base Base! This is Tsukioka! I've spotted
Kobayashi's plane. I'm going to try to pick him up.
Roger, roger. Be careful!
- Tsukioka, please try!
How are you? Are you injured?
I'm fine. I'm just happy that you came out to help me so quickly.
From the sound of it, the girls back at the base were pretty worried.
What? Those crazy ladies were concerned about me?
This place hasn't affected your head!
Run Kobayashi!
Godzilla! I'm sure that's Godzilla!
Godzilla?
Hey, let's run for it!
Ah, here it is.
- He's right.
Really?
Well Yamane, it seems that our belief turned out to be real, huh?
Our darkest dreams have come back to greet us.
Then you think this is another Godzilla?
Yes. Godzilla was created from a hydrogen bomb.
Now, it may have affected an Angilosaurus.
Angilosaurus?
Yes. This is an Angilosaurus.
The Angilosaurus, otherwise known as the monster
Angilas, is roughly 70 to 150 million years old.
It was one of the stronger dinosaurs that lived in the prehistoric era.
Of course, Godzilla was also alive during that time. May I...?
What we know about them comes from Poland's world animal specialist, Professor Plateli Hondon.
Let me read it to you.
Angilas is about 150 to 200 feet tall and it is also a carnivore.
This behavior is typical for a creature this large.
However, one thing makes Angilas very different from other creatures from its time...
Its behavior shows it was smart in how it employed its body.
To continue, its chest and abdomen were its only vulnerable areas.
However, Angilas is one of the few creatures that had a thorough hatred for war-like predators.
The two must have fought since the beginning and now its come back from Godzilla's past.
It's a terrible thing to say, but we may not have anything that can oppose Angilas.
Next, Professor Yamane, who flew in from Tokyo will speak on our Godzilla countermeasures.
Well, I would tell you about the Godzilla countermeasures, but I regret that we have no effective strategy for it.
There are no policies that will stop Godzilla.
I have no methods to tell you at this time.
I came here from Tokyo to show you films that we have collected after Godzilla's attack on Tokyo.
I was hoping that we may be able to decide on some effective countermeasures after we review this data.
Well then...
Now, to repeat, we used our weapons and our concentrated strategies.
A fearful combination... Yet the vast attack could not drive Godzilla away from us.
But professor, we killed
Godzilla once before...
Yes, with the Oxygen Destroyer. That Godzilla is at the bottom of Tokyo bay due to the Oxygen Destroyer.
All the information related to that invention is gone.
The despair caused by Godzilla's rampage cannot be helped.
Professor, is this
Godzilla on its own?
Yes, but we have another that we must face.
This time, Godzilla has emerged together with this new threat, Angilas.
Now we must wonder if this new menace is connected to the hydrogen bomb.
But professor, they were set for minimal destruction.
Yes, I shouldn't give you my own theory now.
This discussion is to confirm our present situation.
Yet, we should consider the effects it may have had to some of nature's inhabitants.
We should thoroughly examine the cause.
From that, we should focus on the circumstances should it come ashore in Tokyo.
Godzilla was sensitive to the emergency lights.
Using them made it extremely violent.
Then the hydrogen bomb's glare must have awakened it, I imagine.
The light may make it that way due to some mysterious habit.
Well, I believe there could be a way to reverse this habit.
We should drop a light bomb near
Godzilla's path, so it can lure it away.
At this point, I don't believe it will produce a very bad result, but it's all we have to work with for now.
Osaka will be alright, won't it?
Well, I'm not sure what will happen to Tokyo.
It's so quiet, don't you think it's awful?
Yes, I'm not used to it being so quiet.
Well, do you think Tokyo stands a chance?
Idiot! Don't tell me that's what you believe too?
They'll pull through it.
Then, that's great.
When this is over, you can see it for yourself.
Oh, really?
They must be beginning.
The search for Godzilla is continuing.
Last night's search was unsuccessful.
Its whereabouts are still unknown.
Every available plane is to diligently pursue it until all routes have been completely exhausted...
...or its current position and movement have been reported to base. Over.
Where do you think Godzilla could be heading?
It could be at the bottom of the ocean, moving along the earth's crust in numerous directions.
If it's traveling down there this time, there's no way to tell which way it could be going.
So, we won't know its location.
Command, command.
This is aircraft 54, aircraft 54.
At 15:24 hours, Godzilla has been spotted on radar in the ocean at north 34 degrees, east 130 degrees.
We will continue to follow on radar. Over.
Command. Command. This is Frigate T-10.
At 15:32 hours, we have tracked Godzilla to east 134 degrees, north 33 degrees. Maintaining pursuit, over.
This is command, this is command.
We have confirmation at east 134.5 degrees, north 34.3 degrees.
Professor, Godzilla is moving from this area.
Really? Have the planes reach it here and send our fourth fleet in pursuit.
From military command, this is the three o'clock announcement.
Today the 4th southern fleet was ordered to a state of urgent readiness.
After a lengthy search, Godzilla was discovered traveling on a northeast course.
In the middle of the night, the 4th southern fleet will inevitably pinpoint its position and surround it.
Please continue listening for immediate updates should it reach the coastline. Repeating...
Boss, with Godzilla loose in that area...
We'll have to stay grounded for a while.
Certainly we'll also have to reduce our factory output to accommodate for it.
Yeah, I wish they would drop this light bomb and get it over with!
Hey, this is a big undertaking. It's not a small problem that you can...
It's the same as the time when you fell ill after eating all that fish!
May I have your attention please. Everyone in the
Osaka area is asked to head calmly to the shelters.
At 19:30 hours, military command has announced
Godzilla's course tracked by the 4th southern fleet.
At the moment, its present course will bring it towards the coastline of Osaka.
In order to test the light bomb, we will need to extinguish every light in the entire city.
Hey, what's that?!
The civilians of this ward are in the shelters.
- The shelters report that all is well.
Good.
All military units, all military units. Please assist in evacuating all civilians to the emergency shelters.
All military units, all military units...
Oh, Tsukioka. The boss has gone to the factory.
What? The factory?
Yes, he wants us to meet him there.
Really? Alright.
Well Hidemi, I think you'll be safe enough in the house while we're away.
Yes. You be careful.
Hey, let's go!
- Goodbye, Hidemi!
Tsukioka, Take care of papa.
- Goodbye!
At the moment, Godzilla is being lured away with the military's light bombs.
It is gradually being drawn away from approaching Osaka's coastline.
In order to protect our lives and property, please continue maintaining the Osaka city blackout.
Boss! Boss! Godzilla is moving away from the docks without incident!
This saves Osaka and Godzilla any trouble.
Right. It was too close for comfort.
Hey, sit down! Hey!
Hey, what's wrong?
It looks like one of your friends is sick.
Him? Again?
Stop the car!
Hurry! Hurry! Move! Move!
Halt!
Freeze!
- Stay Where you are!
Hey, over here!
Stop!
Criminals are in that truck!
Damn!
What's that?
That's Angilas!
Angilas?
Boss! Boss! Let's get away from this disaster!
Boss, let's go!
So, Godzilla wasn't lured away with light bombs.
You would think that it had a chance.
Boss! Let's get out of here!
Hurry! Hurry!
Boss, you can't expect any more!
So, let's go...
That way!
What? Really?
Evacuate! Evacuate! Evacuate!
After the ferocious attack by the monster Godzilla, the greatest disaster of this century is over.
But, please let me repeat, our love for peace in the world must be set aside to combat against Godzilla.
For the good of us all, we should consider the idea of using a hydrogen bomb against Godzilla.
Godzilla is a violent creature. I believe we must make the proper defenses.
Angilas was defeated by Godzilla, but not before destroying this once quiet city.
Shibashi, that smoke is rising from the area where my factory once stood.
The damage is much worse than I imagined.
Shibashi, I'm going to rebuild it.
I want you to be my partner.
Have you decided on a location for it?
I'm told that Hokkaido is a nice place to operate from.
Oh, will you be going with us?
Miss, I'm in a hurry to fly out this morning.
Boss! They're not sure about
Godzilla's whereabouts.
The marine authority hasn't discovered its current position yet.
Really? Good job!
We will do our best to look for it.
Kobayashi, you lived in Hokkaido, right?
Huh? Hokkaido?
The vice president and I were discussing how our firm's ships could operate from a useless port.
For some time we've thought about a plan to relocate the factory to the Hokkaido area.
I understand. You want me to fly a plane up there to survey locations.
Thank you. I was hoping you'd do it.
- Yes, sir.
Papa, then we'll still have our station jobs?
No, but yourjobs with the firm will be transferred once we move.
Oh, I see.
Until we go to Hokkaido, shape this place up for the time being.
Okay, okay.
Hidemi, you have my sympathy. Your long awaited wedding ceremony was ruined by Godzilla.
Maybe, but my fiancee has come this far,
I'm sure he's still very patient, huh?
I give up! Okay, we'd better hurry and get to
Hokkaido so our bridegroom doesn't reconsider.
Like you wouldn't have your hand in such a wicked operation.
Kobayashi, you'll find out that women are different than fish.
I'll wait, thanks!
Well, this official timekeeper has to head to
Hokkaido in order to make a purchase.
Ten thousand pardons.
This from an incompetent man.
You bastard!
Boss, I haven't found out where our bridegroom has gone to yet.
Well, you did your best. What place does our man have for us this time?
Our man thinks this area might hold something for us.
Oh really? Well, if our bridegroom wants me to go there...
This is his ninth choice. He must be willing to wait a while...
Aye, sir.
Be careful bridegroom!
- Who me?
Captain! Captain, we've just received our next destination.
42 degrees north, 146 degrees east.
That's it alright.
Kobayashi has come out to greet us!
- You're right! Hey! Hey!
Well... oh, hey, hey!
- Yes sir?
Going out nine times has been a difficult task.
Let's break our arrangements for tonight and call the local restaurant to set up a party.
Right!
Save some for me.
Is he hungry?
- What's the matter? Hey!
Kobayashi, Kobayashi!
This is base, this is base.
Yes, this is Kobayashi.
Kobayashi, return home immediately.
Return home.
Is this Hidemi?
- Of course. We're waiting for you.
Really? Tsukioka too?
- Yes. He's with Papa in his airplane.
Hmm? I'll wait.
Hey, Kobayashi...
- Oh, you're there?
Yes. We have our first settlement in
Osaka and we need a fast plane.
Really? Have you met this person before?
- Me? Who?
The nice person...
- What? The nice person?
Kobayashi, who are you referring to?
The one he's meeting.
- Hey, will you tell me?
Himitsu!
- Pervert! He's not seeing her!
Oh, that would be horrible!
Hey, who could it be?
Well, who would he know in Hokkaido?
Hey, who is it?
An old companion.
Hey, Okami!
Okami!
The service here stinks!
Oh, bridegroom! Everyone is waiting this way!
- Okay, okay!
Hey, Tsukioka! It's me! It's me!
It's you guys! How are you doing?
You look great!
They went to the same college in his younger days.
My old boss!
Tsukioka! You're the reason that I'm at this place?
I heard that someone I knew was getting married.
What a pleasant surprise!
It's the least I can do!
Let's go inside for a toast!
Please come with us, Mrs...
- Hey, hey. You're as quick as ever with the ladies!
Get inside!
I'm going to talk to someone.
Tsukioka, have another!
- No, that's enough.
What? You bastard, are you already limiting yourself to a woman's level of drinking?
I'm sorry.
Kobayashi, lets have a drink.
- Yes sir!
Thank you.
It sounds like they're finished.
- Yes sir.
Ah, bridegroom!
- It's alright. I'm with the party.
Hey bridegroom!
- You're late!
I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
Kobayashi, I think it's very strange.
Why do you let them call you "bridegroom"?
That funny name was given to me.
- Is it really a nickname?
Yes, for the moment...
You're not going to let me find out are you, bridegroom?
Here are all the single...
- Oh, let me look!
Not yet! Not at this time!
You evil man!
Excuse me. Kobayashi, Tsukioka, our secondary ship has sank into the sea!
It sank, you say?
The only possible explanation is Godzilla.
Godzilla?
You go to the Marine Authority.
- Yes, sir!
Excuse me.
Why do you say that it's Godzilla?
This gentleman filed the report.
- Yes.
Our secondary ship notified us of their discovery of Godzilla by wireless radio.
But at the same time, the S.O.S. It was transmitting was abruptly cut off.
Ikeda!
- Yes, sir!
Notify the emergency center immediately!
- Yes, sir!
Tajima!
- Yes, sir!
You will leave for the Maritime
Authority first thing tomorrow!
Yes, sir!
This is base, this is base.
Any luck, Tsukioka?
This is Tsukioka. We haven't discovered
Godzilla's location yet. Over.
The weather is turning bad. Our bosses think you should return home. Over.
Tell the bosses I'm continuing. Present location is, 50 degrees north, 147.3 degress east.
Well, you don't have to be the one to find it!
Don't get lost in a fantasy! Please come home!
Aye, Aye. Don't worry about me.
This is base, this is base.
Do you read me, Tsukioka?
This is Tsukioka.
Tell the bosses I'm still searching.
Tsukioka! Tsukioka!
Return home at once!
Jackass!
Hidemi, could you tell me what gifts you two would like?
Is today bad?
What do you want me to tell you?
Hey what kind of girl stuff would you want?
No, if today isn't good for you...
I understand. Well, I'll tell you.
No, I can't. I don't want your feelings hurt.
- Then you want me to stop?
No, but I may not like what I hear.
Girl stuff, huh?
What color would I like?
I'm not sure. It's a...?
- Handbag.
A handbag, huh?
A watch.
- A watch? That's expensive.
Stockings are good.
Hey, how many am I allowed?
You're dangerous!
It's not bad if you wanted me to tell you!
That Tsukioka is late!
This is Tsukioka! This is Tsukioka!
I found Godzilla and I am in pursuit. Over.
Roger, roger! Listen,
I beg you, be careful!
Tsukioka! Are you alright on your own?
I'll be home soon.
Idiot! I'm coming out there!
What are your coordinates?
140.8 degrees east, 53 degrees north, near
Shinko Island. Godzilla is heading there.
Alright, I've got it! I'll meet you there!
- Kobayashi!
Do me a favor. Be careful, ok?
- Roger!
Use this time to decide on what the best gift for you would be.
Yes, I'll decide.
If you please...
Godzilla is presently headed for Shinko Island!
Godzilla is presently headed for Shinko Island!
Tajima!
- Yes, sir!
Prepare to load our planes with bombs!
- Yes, sir!
Anyway, Godzilla came through this opening from the ocean. That much I'm sure of.
What if we bomb here? I think that would leave Godzilla with no way out.
Alright. We'll drop bombs to prevent it from using that as an exit.
Ikeda!
- Yes, sir!
Refuel the planes with gasoline as soon as they land.
- Yes sir!
Tajima!
- Yes, sir!
Prepare to load the planes.
- Yes, sir!
You bastard!
This is Kobayashi! This is Kobayashi!
Godzilla is moving towards the sea passage.
Hurry up with those planes! Over.
The Air Force planes should be arriving in the vicinity around 15:12.
Roger, roger!
Damn! He'll get away!
All planes, attack!
Tajima, the attack didn't do it.
Damn!
Hey, Tajima! That's it! That's it! Bury it in the ice! Bury Godzilla in the ice!
Right! Drop your bombs on the icecaps! Create an avalanche!
Papa!
What's wrong, Hidemi?
It's Kobayashi.
What? Kobayashi?
Yes, he didn't make the second pass.
Really? Kobayashi...?
It's just... he didn't want to be left out of the action.
It's no use!
Alright, we'll hit the mountainside with a rocket!
Our first wave of rockets immobilized it for now. Return to base to reload so we can finish Godzilla!
Alright. We can trigger a larger avalanche hitting this spot. There's no other way.
But, this is a very difficult attack, okay?
- Yes, sir!
If we come in from this area, the explosions will level the entire mountainside.
Our first attack immobilized Godzilla. Our second attack will bury it completely!
We'll bring these mountain peaks down upon it!
These are two difficult tasks we ask of you, but we shall pull through and we will be successful!
Alright?
- Yes sir!
We are finished loading the rockets.
Okay, let's get going immediately.
- Yes, sir!
We're going!
Tajima, please let me go too! I have to go along with you. I beg you!
Tsukioka, isn't your life with yourjob?
My mind is made up.
Hey, bring the drums out!
Hey! Hurry before Godzilla can escape!
Hurry! Hurry!
Hurry! Hurry!
They're late.
Look out! All units,
Fall back! Fall back!
Hurry up troops! Hey look out!
Fall back! Hurry!
Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!
Alright, fire!
Hey, aren't they here yet?
That fire will only last three minutes!
Hey, they're coming!
- They're coming?
It's working! That did it!
- Son of a bitch! Do it again!
Damn! Alright...
Be careful, third squad!
Damn!
They did it! They did it!
Kobayashi...
We got Godzilla for you...
The word ''lycanthropy'' is defined as
a human being having the power
of becoming a wolf, or of having the power
of turning another human into a wolf.
Some say lycanthropy stems from
nothing but myth and superstition.
Yet the belief that a human
can turn into a wolf
has persisted since the Dark Ages
to this very day.
It is a universal belief.
The ancient Romans and Greeks
wrote of the phenomenon.
There are tales of such happenings
in Borneo, Turkey, South America.
Everywhere.
The American Navajo Indians
and other tribes tell stories about wolf-men.
The legends have persisted from
the beginnings of man's memory of time.
Why?
Why haven't these tales died?
The tales that say wolf-men roam the earth.
Nothing smaller?
Hey, mister.
Your change.
You a stranger in Mountaincrest?
You don't know me? l've never seen you before in my life. l guess l'm just passing through.
You guess? l'll be right back.
Yeah, you'd better make sure.
You didn't pay for your drinks yet.
-Hey, bud.
-Yes?
You left Chad's sudden-like.
Could you tell me, do l live in this town?
You didn't get that crocked on just one drink.
How's about you coming back and buying me a couple?
No, l think there is something l must do. l'm broke, friend.
You got almost twenty bucks. l saw it.
How about just handing it over?
Why? Why should l? l'm in a hurry. l don't like talk.
So now we don't have any more talk, huh?
Just give me the money.
Ma Everett!
What in blue blazes you yelling like that?
-lt came out of the alley!
-lt? What do you mean, it?
Two men were fighting.
They were in the alley.
Only that thing came out.
Let's take a look.
Well, you're the deputy sheriff, you go first.
You girls wait here.
Hoxie!
His throat.
Hoxie...
Only an animal could do that to a man's throat.
Hank, go get Doc Jonas!
Now, who was it, Ma?
Who went in the alley with Joe? l don't know. l never saw him before.
Hoxie, you got any guns at your place?
-l got a couple of deer guns.
-Well, go get them.
-Min, you tell Jack Haines.
-But, honey, l'm scared.
Yeah, l know. But l want the sheriff to know. l'll go with you. Come on. l'll drop you off on the way, Ma.
Hey, look at them tracks.
Yeah. Nobody would run across that field unless they were trying to get away.
Come on.
There.
Those are wolf tracks. l seen them in Canada.
Oh, there ain't ever been wolves around here.
Do you suppose some animal got the guy?
The snow doesn't show any signs of a fight.
Just his shoe marks.
And then... Then those. l'll tell you something else.
Whatever made those tracks was walking on two legs.
Well, l ain't going any further.
This is a job for the sheriff.
You think it's as simple as that, Hoxie?
Just another job for the law? l don't know what l think.
Mack, you go back with Hoxie.
You tell Jack Haines exactly where l am.
At the top of Pearson's land, where it goes up the hill.
You ain't staying here by yourself.
Do as l say. l'm a deputy and l get paid.
This is no job for you.
Just don't waste any time and get Jack out here quick.
Clovey, there's no sense...
Look, l've got a gun.
Nobody's gonna bother me. Now, get going.
Go on, get going. That's an order. l tell you, we should've never let Clovey stay up there by himself.
You heard him. He gave us an order.
All right. Stop arguing. lt wasn't your responsibility, either of you.
Look, have a drink on me, huh?
Hey, they're coming!
The sheriff and Clovey.
Clovey! l don't want you breathing a word about what happened tonight to anyone.
Understand? Nobody. l don't want this getting around the town before we know what it's all about.
-Sure, Jack. Sure.
-Min, Cora? l'm scared to even think about it.
-l won't talk.
-Me, neither.
You see the thing, Clovey?
Get back inside the bar, all of you.
Just stay sober enough to keep your mouths closed.
-Clovey. You, too?
-He's been hurt pretty bad, Amy.
-Can Doc get on it right away?
-Yes. Come in here.
How's Joe Mitchell?
He was dead when they brought him here.
My uncle's got him in the other room until they can get the undertaker up here in the morning from Larken. l'll get my uncle.
Thanks.
Feel like telling me about it?
Well, there's not much to tell, Jack.
The thing didn't make a sound.
All of a sudden, it was clawing and ripping at me.
And l yell and you fired that shot and the thing took off.
You know, it's a good thing you came along when you did.
Ripping at you with what?
-You're gonna think l'm batty.
-No.
Well, maybe...
Maybe it had hands covered with hair.
Or maybe it had paws, like a wolf.
Only it wasn't all wolf. l didn't get much chance to see.
Pity people can't get themselves killed and chewed up during the daytime.
Man my age needs his sleep.
Pretty bad lacerations, Clovey.
What's the matter? Wouldn't she kiss you?
Wasn't a kissing mood, Doc.
Yeah, men ain't as good as they used to be.
Gonna tell me about it? l don't know, Doc. l'm trying to decide.
Gonna make a medical report.
One man killed by an animal.
Another, darn near.
Besides, you want to marry Amy, you'd better tell me.
We're not sure it was an animal.
Clovey, grit your store teeth.
Give me a little more, Amy.
Grit your store teeth, and grit them good, 'cause this isn't going to feel good.
Ow! Doc! Suffering catfish.
There. Better hope this takes. l'm not even sure whether l have to give you the Pasteur treatment for rabies or not.
Neither am l.
Wrap it up, Amy.
Jack, what are you trying to do?
Scare us half to death?
What are you holding back? lt wasn't an animal that killed Joe.
The same goes for Clovey. lt was a man.
There were teeth marks of an animal on Joe's throat.
We both examined Joe.
Amy's a good nurse, Jack.
She knows what she sees. So do l.
She's right about the teeth marks.
Well that's the trouble, Doc. l think we both are.
What are you talking about?
Well, it had to be either animal or man. l wouldn't lay odds on that, Doc.
Man, what you're trying to say is just a lot of poppycock.
Storybook stuff.
The things kids get nightmares about. l know, l know. But a witness saw what looked like a man kill Joe, and Clovey here is stone sober.
You got answers for it? l haven't.
There is a word for what you're saying, Jack.
Yeah, l went to school, Amy.
Werewolf? lf you think l'm gonna put that in my medical report...
A murder's been committed.
You can make out your report any way you like, but it was murder. lt wasn't a man accidentally killed by an animal. lf this gets in the papers, they're gonna think we're all crazy up here.
Okay, Doc. Can l go now?
Yes, but don't use the arm too much.
-lf what you're saying is the truth...
-l will take up the search in the morning. l'm not letting anyone go looking through those woods at night. l don't know whether l should take a sedative so l can sleep or drink coffee to stay awake.
Well, you can get some sleep, hon.
The deputies from Larken will be here in about an hour.
They'll help me police the town and set up roadblocks.
Nothing's getting in or out of town without us knowing.
-l'll check with you in the morning.
-Thanks, Amy. Doc.
By the way, if you have any books on the subject, you might read up and tell us what we're looking for.
-Good night.
-Good night.
What a night this is going to be.
Dead man in the other room and a werewolf running around loose.
You know, Jack's got me believing that?
Amy, those old books of mine up in the attic...
There's a couple on mythology.
Long as we can't sleep, they should make some interesting reading.
No! l was dreaming! l know l was dreaming! lt could only be that some animal came by while l was asleep.
Oh, Lord in heaven!
Give us a break, Sheriff. l promised the boss l'd bring him back a deer. l'm sorry, men. Nobody's gonna do any hunting in those woods until l say so.
Anyone tries it, l'll slap the biggest fine on him l can.
-But why?
-Never mind why.
Just stay inside the town. lt's going to look awfully funny going back without any meat.
How do you like that?
The boys are sure raising Cain over not getting their hunting licenses.
Yeah, but they'll get over it.
You watch the store. l'm going down to check the roadblocks.
All right. l can't help it what papers you boys are from.
-All l know is the orders we got.
-Trouble?
Reporters from the city papers.
Reporters? What do you men want here?
You usually set up roadblocks because a man got killed by some animal?
-How did you men know about that?
-There's a talkative undertaker in Larken.
We saw the body.
Come on, Sheriff, let us through.
You have no right to hide the news.
Besides, that guy charged us seven bucks just to drive up the mountain.
-All right. Let them through.
-Okay, Jack.
-They go through!
-Thanks, Sheriff.
Say, do you know anything about what's happening up in Mountaincrest that we ought to know?
You think there's a story, you find it. lt's been quiet.
Car 1 7's out having a look along the roads.
Well, let me know pronto if they see anything. lf he tries to stray off the road dressed the way you say he is, he'll freeze to death up there. l'm counting on that. l'll check with you later.
What do you want?
Sorry. l didn't mean to frighten you. l saw the doctor's sign at the front of the door.
No one answered the ring.
My uncle's probably upstairs. ls someone ill?
Could l talk to him, please? lt's...
-lt's very important.
-Of course.
-Follow me in the back way. lt's shorter.
-Thank you.
Doc, someone to see you.
-This is Mister...
-Dr. Gilchrist.
-lf l can talk to you, please.
-Come in.
Amy always listens.
Sometimes she diagnoses better than l do.
-l didn't say l was sick.
-No?
She'd better listen, anyhow.
Take a seat, Mister... l don't know what my name is.
Well, that's a good beginning.
That's why l had to see you. l can't remember who l am, or even what l'm doing in this town.
You're a stranger here?
When did you arrive? l think last night.
Well, let's try and think back a bit, get a few facts.
What's the last thing you remember? l'm not sure. lt seems as if there was an automobile accident. Not a bad one.
-l was taken to a doctor's office.
-Who was the doctor?
There were two of them. l never saw them before.
That's all. That's all l can remember. l've been trying to remember more but there's nothing.
Doctor, l want to know who l am. l want to know what l am.
What you are?
Was there a man killed in this town last night?
Yes.
How?
The sheriff thinks it was some kind of animal.
No. l killed him.
Now, now, lad. You're just a little bit upset.
Those tracks l saw in the snow this morning, they had to be mine.
They couldn't have been anything but mine.
Doctor, in the name of heaven, what's happened to me?
Amy, maybe our friend would like a little something to quiet him down.
What makes you think you killed somebody?
A man pushed me into an alley last night.
Tried to take my money.
-l couldn't let him have it. lt was all l had.
-So?
He hit me and... l thought l was dreaming... l leaped at him and he fell and then l...
Here. You'd better take these.
They'll help you...
No!
You're not giving me anything.
-Those other doctors did something to me.
-Now, now, now, take it easy, lad.
We can't help you if you won't let us.
-Let's get a hold of Sheriff Haines.
-l saw the police on the road.
They had guns.
The man in the woods last night, he had a gun.
Josie? Quick, get me the sheriff's office.
Sheriff's office. Clovey speaking.
Oh, hello, Amy.
No, no, Jack isn't around.
He should be back in about a half-hour.
What?
Look, Amy, are you sure?
Well, after all, for such a thing like that to happen...
All l know is it has happened.
Doc Jonas and l will come down and wait.
We must talk to Jack.
-Well, maybe he thought that Doc would...
-What's this?
Well, the guy that killed Joe was in the Doc's office not more than 20 minutes ago.
You okay?
He got away. Bolted like a jackrabbit when l mentioned the police. lt wasn't the police he was afraid of, it was your guns. l want you to round up every man you can get.
We're going to search every inch of those woods.
-Oh, Jack, listen to me, please...
-Honey, there's no time. Go ahead.
-He's not a criminal. He's a sick man.
-Man? lt was nothing but a human being that came into our office, Jack. l didn't get a chance to examine him.
He remembers an automobile accident and his brain may have been injured.
He can't even remember his name or where he came from.
Jack, help him. Don't shoot him down.
He committed a murder, Amy.
What can l do? lf he wants to surrender, okay.
-But what if he doesn't?
-He was afraid of us, too.
He said some other doctor had done something to him.
-What?
-That, he didn't say. l've never seen a man so frightened in my life, Jack.
Give him a break, if you can.
-lf we could just talk to the other doctor.
-lt's no use.
He can't remember the doctor's name or even what town he was in. l found Mack outside.
He's going to line up some men for us.
Okay. Clovey.
-You run up against this guy in the woods?
-Yeah?
Doc and Amy think we should take him alive.
Well, that won't be easy.
You're the boss, Jack.
But if it means the necks of any of those men out there, they're gonna shoot.
We'll do the best we can.
Doctors try to save people.
The law doesn't always have a choice.
Morgan.
You think this is our man?
This paper says they found an animal's teeth marks on the dead man's throat.
Morgan, what have you done?
Done?
Accomplished is a better word, Emery.
Someday, it will happen.
The human race will destroy itself.
Not quickly but slowly.
That wolf-man is the proof.
Radiation creates mutants, people who become monsters, no longer human.
They'll make the hydrogen bomb more powerful, then more powerful again, enough to change every person on the face of the earth into a crawling, inhuman thing through fallout radiation.
You really believe it will happen in our lifetime?
The science of destruction always gains on us, Emery. lt could happen tomorrow, next day, next week. l don't know.
-But it won't happen to us.
-Well, how can you be sure? l wasn't until l read that newspaper.
The serum we used from that wolf-mutant that died of radiation, that was the answer.
By a slow series of inoculations, we can immunize ourselves and a small, select group, just as l planned.
When the rest of the world has been destroyed, we will be the only normal, thinking persons left.
The perfect science, Emery.
The one that ends all science.
Perhaps it would've been better not to know what's coming.
Ridiculous. lt will mean the beginning of a new kind of world.
A world that will start without hatred.
-And we'll be the ones to give it birth.
-How did we get into this, Morgan?
Two doctors, full of ideals and curiosity.
Too much curiosity?
A doctor should be able to cure more than broken bones and runny noses. l want to cure a world.
You see, l still have my idealism. You don't.
But to take a stranger, a man, injured in an accident and give him a full inoculation of that serum...
Yes, l'd almost forgotten about him.
So much could fail if he should remember and tell someone what he knows about us.
There's nothing else left but to...
Well, you're not going to kill him.
Do you think he still wants to live after what he's become? lt'll be an act of charity.
-There's somebody at the door.
-Another patient with a runny nose. l'll get rid of him and we'll drive to the town of Mountaincrest immediately. lt's less than 40 miles. lf the police haven't disposed of the man by the time we get there, it may become our task.
-Dr. Chambers?
-Yes? l'm Mrs. Duncan Marsh.
Oh, the man who was injured in the automobile accident. l haven't heard from him and the police said that you might know where he is.
The police?
Well, yes, they said he was injured near here, and they brought him in to you.
Well, that's right, but l wouldn't worry. lt was just a bump on the head.
As a matter of fact, l left him in my office for a moment, and when l came back, he was gone. l can only presume he doesn't think much of doctors.
-Was he all right?
-Of course, Mrs. Marsh.
Even his car was only slightly damaged.
He fell asleep at the wheel, ran into a tree, and hit his head on the steering wheel. l'm sure you'll be hearing from him shortly. l hope so. Usually when he travels like this he calls me every day.
A most considerate husband.
Well, thank you. l feel much better about it now.
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.
What'd the doctor say, Mom?
Did he know about Dad?
The doctor said he was fine.
Now what do you want to do?
-Go shopping? A movie, what?
-Would you mind, Mom? l'd rather go home.
Maybe Dad'll call up or something.
All right, we'll go home. Come on, scoot.
Five hours out here and no sign of anything.
Well, l hope the boys at Mile High Ridge are doing better than we are.
Hold it, men.
Sorry, men. You'll have to turn back. lt's urgent that we get to Mountaincrest, Officer.
We're doctors and may have information that will help the sheriff. lnformation?
We believe the man involved in that murder up here was a patient of ours.
All right. Check in at the sheriff's office when you get there.
-Wait here a minute, we'll open up.
-Thank you.
-You shouldn't have told him that.
-We'd never have got through otherwise.
-Apparently, they haven't caught Marsh yet.
-There's no time to lose.
We'll check in at one of the lodges and then tell the sheriff that we want to help.
What can we do that the deputies can't do?
We know one thing for sure that they don't.
They're looking for a man.
We're looking for an animal with an animal's instincts and habits. l doubt if they'll ever catch Duncan Marsh in the open. lf there's a hidden spot anywhere in the forest, an animal will find it.
Jack, it's going to be dark in about another hour. Think we ought to turn back?
No, we'll push on for another half mile or so. l hate to think of that thing loose for another night near the town.
Put out the fire, Red.
Over there, in that hilly section.
Go on, take a look up there.
Marsh!
You. You were with him.
You were with that other doctor.
Please. Help me, please.
Don't move, Marsh.
Don't come a step nearer.
There's nothing we can do for you.
You're going to shoot me? But why?
What have l ever done to you?
Morgan! Morgan! Morgan!
-Who told you to fire that shot?
-That creature up there.
-Why did you shoot at me?
-l'm Sheriff Haines.
We had that mine entrance located and we were closing in on it.
-You scared the thing away.
-Why didn't you shoot at it yourself?
From this distance and miss the way you did?
Morgan!
-Who's that?
-Dr. Forrest.
-Morgan, Morgan, l saw him, his face.
-What did you see?
One moment it was a human being talking to me, and then it changed.
His hair and his ears and his teeth.
Everything. lt would have killed me if it hadn't been for that shot.
Only authorized people of the searching party were supposed to be out here.
Let me explain, Sheriff. l'm Dr. Morgan Chambers.
Dr. Emery Forrest and l came to Mountaincrest this afternoon to offer our services.
For what?
The man you're looking for was a patient of ours.
A patient?
Jack, it's going to get dark before we get back.
Yeah. We'll set up sentry posts around the town for tonight.
All right.
You make an official report at my office.
Somebody will be around in a couple of hours with some more coffee.
-Just make sure you keep awake.
-Yeah, okay.
Jack, why do you suppose those two doctors really came here?
They could have phoned you the information.
Well, they claim they have a personal interest in our wolf-man.
Personal? They only treated him once.
Then they didn't even know his name.
Well, at least we know the car accident took place in Brockville.
The report from the police down there should be in soon.
What a horrible, horrible thing to happen to a human being.
Yeah, l know.
-lt happened again.
-What this time?
The thing killed a sheep at the Sanderson ranch, then it started to... lt started to eat it like a starving animal.
Laura Sanderson saw it.
She's in the office now, hysterical. l want all the farms in the area evacuated.
Call the people. Tell them to get into town as fast as possible. lf they haven't got phones, send trucks out for them.
All right.
You still think we should treat this thing like a sick man? l don't know, Jack. l just don't know. lf you'd only heard him plea for help the way l did.
You, Doc and l had better have a huddle, honey.
Why? l have something in mind that you and Doc won't like. lf you can say anything that'll make me see it differently, l'll forget it.
You want me to talk you out of it, Jack, and l'm not so sure l know how. l can only give you the same arguments l gave you before. lt's vicious and cruel.
How can you do that to another human being?
Amy, the lives of everyone in this town are dependent on the police right now.
Why don't you try to see it my way? lf this thing killed a sheep because it was hungry, it'll go for bait in a trap for the same reason.
A bear trap could crush its leg, too.
Maybe that'd be better than having to shoot him, Amy. A leg can be healed.
And if we can catch him, perhaps a sick mind can be healed, too. lf only that thing hadn't come to your office.
How can she defend it that way? l've seen you pick up an injured bear cub in the forest and care for it till it was well.
-That's not a strong enough argument.
-All right, then, Jack, do what you have to.
-Good night, Doc.
-Good night.
This makes eight traps we've set.
How many more we got to go, Jack?
Just these three.
That'll cover all the areas around the town.
Calling Car 22. Calling Car 22.
Hey, Jack. Your radio.
Calling Car 22. Come in, Jack.
Hold it, Clovey. Jack's coming.
Clovey?
Jack, things are popping here.
Can you come back?
Right away.
Help Fanning finish those last three traps.
-Okay.
-l'll send a car back for you. l told you, if there was any news to be had, you'd get it.
You've been telling us that for some time...
Hey, Sheriff, you gonna give us a story, or are you still making with the sign language?
What happened?
Well, number one, one of our cruisers found a car ditched off the road.
Where?
About halfway up the road leading into town.
The car is registered to a Duncan Marsh,
1670 Lane Drive, Cedar Corners.
Cedar Corners?
That's about 30 miles from Brockville, where those doctors are from.
Number two, a police report came in from Brockville.
-Duncan Marsh has a wife and son.
-Wife and son? lf this Marsh is a wolf-man, it ain't gonna be pretty.
His wife and kid are on their way up here now.
My guess is that Marsh is our guy.
His wife filed a missing persons report on him two days ago.
How do you explain a thing like this to a wife and kid?
Maybe you don't try.
Did you leave an okay for her to get through the roadblock?
Yeah. l don't want those newspaper men on her back. l guess the best thing would be if Doc and Amy'd take her in. l'll see if l can fix it up.
When she gets here, bring her over.
All right.
Mountaincrest.
We almost missed the turn-off.
-Mom?
-Yes, Chris?
How would Dad's car get all the way up here?
Well, he might have been up here on business.
Maybe something happened to the motor and he got stuck.
-lt'll be all right.
-He didn't even phone us or anything.
You're a worrier, honey.
Emery, that woman's in town.
The wife of Duncan Marsh.
The deputies took her to the house of a Dr. Gilchrist.
She doesn't know anything.
What could she tell them?
She can't tell them anything.
But her being in town means the deputies might try to take him alive, rather than killing him.
Every minute that he's alive is dangerous to us.
Morgan, can't we turn back?
We're not murderers.
We're both responsible for what Duncan Marsh has become.
When time comes to kill him, you'll be with me.
These are a little out-of-date, Chris.
Doc Jonas hasn't worn these in...
Well, let's say a long time.
Think they'll fit you?
-l don't know.
-Well, come on, hold up your foot.
Yeah, l think they'll do fine.
-You're being so good to us, Miss Standish.
-lt's nice having guests.
-Miss Standish?
-Yes?
Why is everybody being so vague about my husband? l can't seem to get straight answers from anyone. l'm sure if anyone could tell you anything, they would. l'm not a child, Miss Standish.
My husband's car is here, but he isn't. l read in the papers about a murder at Mountaincrest. ls it possible that the dead man could have been identified wrong?
No. l'm sure your husband's alive, Mrs. Marsh.
Why are you sure? l'm sorry, Chris.
You've been waiting all this time.
Here, try on the skates.
-Thank you.
-l'll see if the lake is frozen...
-Please, Miss Standish.
-Amy, Jack's in the office.
-You'd better see him.
-We'll talk later.
Amy, l just got the word.
Marsh was caught in one of the traps.
-Was caught?
-He got away. The trap was smashed.
-Then he's hurt.
-There were bloodstains in the snow.
Would you care to tell that to his wife and son?
Amy, cut it out.
Men who've had wives and kids have gone to the gas chamber. l'm sorry, Jack.
She was just questioning me and...
Well, how much longer can we keep the truth from her? l'm afraid not much longer. l couldn't help hearing.
-Where's Chris?
-He's still outside.
Sheriff, l appreciate your trying to protect me, but if you don't tell me the truth, l'll have to find out some other way.
Mrs. Marsh, your husband's ill.
He's killed a man. l don't believe it.
Duncan is the most gentle man who ever lived.
Well, something's happened to him.
Just what, we don't know.
-We won't know until we can examine him.
-The papers said something about a man...
You know how the papers are always looking for sensations.
We think we can find your husband, Mrs. Marsh.
He's been injured.
We may be able to bring him in and help him.
Amy, see if you can fix me up a kit.
Bandages, antiseptics, whatever's necessary.
You'll need a doctor with you.
You haven't been able to go through those mountains in winter for 20 years.
-l'll get my things.
-Now, wait a minute. l'm not letting you go out there. lt seems to me l've had better luck with Mr. Marsh than anyone else. lf he's... lf he's himself, there won't be any trouble.
Sheriff, l know Duncan won't give you any trouble if Chris and l are with you.
-l don't know what's right anymore.
-l think Mrs. Marsh is, Jack.
But what if her husband's...
Whatever my husband is, Sheriff Haines, l want to help him in every way l can.
Well, l'm taking a portable public address system with me, so l can talk to him from a distance. l don't want to scare him off again. l'm hoping that we can talk him into giving himself up.
Please, take Chris and me.
Amy, see if you can find some more warm clothes.
Mrs. Marsh and the boy are going with us.
No rifles.
We'll carry pistols under our coats, where he can't see them.
Yeah. l guess most animals are gun-shy after the first shot.
-Hello, Sheriff. Starting a new search?
-Leaving in a few minutes.
Dr. Forrest and l would like to help, if we may.
Thanks, but the less people along this time, the better it might be.
Going to try and take your man alive?
-lf it's possible.
-l see.
Well, l suppose it's the most humane thing at that.
-Can you stay in town a while longer?
-Why, of course, if you wish.
There are some things about this case that are still bothering me.
Maybe you can help clear them up.
-Well, good luck, Sheriff.
-Thanks.
Goodbye. l thought he told you all he knew.
Well, according to Marsh's wife, nothing was ever chalked up against Marsh until his car accident.
Dr. Chambers treated him.
Maybe it means something, maybe it doesn't. We'll find out.
Wait here.
Mom, let me go with them.
That track takes off to the east.
We'll circle around and pick up the trail on the other side of that low hill.
All right. l don't want his wife to see this.
You know, Jack, when this is over with, l'm gonna get drunk and stay that way for a whole week.
You're going to have company.
Duncan. Duncan Marsh.
Duncan Marsh.
If you can hear me, show yourself.
We want to help you.
Duncan Marsh.
We know you've been hurt.
We're here to help you.
Duncan, I know you're hurt.
Duncan, I know you're hurt. Come on down.
We'll keep going.
He couldn't get much further with an injured leg.
Jack, thanks for doing it this way.
Let's hope he's normal when we do find him. lf prayers help, he will be.
Duncan Marsh.
We're ready to help you.
-Show yourself.
-Wait a minute.
Duncan Marsh.
We know you're up there.
Show yourself.
No harm will come to you.
We want to help you.
Nothing.
Mr. Haines, maybe if l could talk to him through that, maybe if he could hear my voice...
Duncan.
Duncan, darling, this is Helen.
Please, listen.
Please, try to understand, Duncan.
We want you to come home.
We want everything to be right again.
These men have promised not to harm you.
Show us where you are, Duncan.
Please, darling.
Chris is here with me.
He wants you to come home, too.
We know you're hurt, darling.
But there's a nurse here
who's going to help you.
Chris? Chris!
Dad! Dad!
Dad!
For the love of Mike, what's the big idea?
What's the deal, coming way out here and not telling us?
Chris.
You didn't even call us. We just waited. l'm sorry, Helen, l'm sorry.
Dad, this is the sheriff.
He and Amy are gonna fix your leg.
Everything's gonna be okay.
Helen, Chris, go away, please.
Don't stay here. Please make them leave.
-Any minute something could happen.
-Dad, l want to be with you!
Mrs. Marsh, your husband needs plasma and l can't administer it while he's upset.
You'd better take Chris and wait below.
Chris, go with your mother. lt was the traps that got him, l tell you.
There's an art in setting them.
You know that.
Place them just right and then kind of figure if the wind'll take the smell of your bait the way you want it.
Yes, sir. Me and the sheriff and Fanning are real handy with a bear trap.
We caught that wolf-man right in the ankle, so he can't run much anymore, can he?
Shut up, Durgis, you talk too much.
Well, l was just... All right, all right, if that's the way you feel...
Excuse me, fellows, l'll go home.
You feel lousy about it, don't you? l was just over to the jail a little while ago.
Jack wanted me to make a statement.
Marsh's wife and kid are there.
Funny. You think maybe you've got all the troubles in the world, till something like this happens to somebody else. l think l need a straight shot. l've never seen anything like it.
Everybody's going crazy.
-All of them scared.
-Scared?
Of what? They're celebrating.
The wolf-man's captured. l think l know what they're scared of.
They're scared of what Marsh has become because it could happen to them. lt could happen to anyone.
You see, now they know it's possible.
Make that a double shot.
How long do we have to wait like this?
Patience, Emery.
Just a little more patience.
How long do you think he'll stay the way he is?
Oh, even he doesn't know that.
You saw the way he broke the bear trap.
What makes you think he couldn't break out of the cell the same way?
Look, l got enough troubles of my own with this report.
Duncan, isn't there anything l can say that will change your mind?
You think it's easy for me to send you and Chris away?
When l'm better, l'll come home.
Please, darling, do as l say. lf it should come back while you're still here, that's the way you'll always remember me. lt would never be any good, even if l did come home.
Please, leave now while l'm still all right.
Dad, l don't want to go!
Please, Chris, don't make it so tough for me.
Come back soon, darling.
We'll be waiting for you.
Come on, son, we have to leave. Come on. l'll send someone all the way home with you.
-The roads are pretty bad at night.
-Thank you.
We'll find out how Marsh got that way.
We'll find out and we'll find a way to cure him.
Go on, now. l'm going over to Doc's.
No matter what, don't leave this place alone for a minute tonight.
You two can spell each other. l'll check back later.
You'd better grab some sleep before you fall flat on your face. l'll take the first shift if you want.
You know, l'm beginning to forget what sleep was like myself.
You know what? lf anything happens in there, get a hold of us quick.
There's an art in setting them.
Oh, yes, there is.
All you... What's the matter?
What's the matter? Ain't nobody else wanna hear how we caught the wolf-man?
-Why don't you get lost?
-Get lost?
Nobody wants to hear about it.
We caught him.
Yeah, we caught him, all right.
Right in the ankle.
You see, Emery, patience is its own reward.
Go to the sheriff's office and find out what precautions are being taken to guard Marsh tonight.
-You're not going to do anything in the jail?
-Please, Emery, do as l ask.
Well, she and the boy are gone.
Gibbs is a good man.
-He'll drive them home, all right.
-We were talking, Jack.
Up until now, what's happened to Duncan Marsh is beyond all our known laws of science and medicine.
You know, this thing didn't come on him suddenly, of his own volition.
You're trying to say somebody did it to him?
Yes.
Well, if it's beyond anything men know, how could somebody do it? lt's a frightening thought that a single human being, out of all the millions and millions, could somehow have obtained that kind of knowledge.
We want to send samples of his blood to a laboratory for tests.
Well, that's up to Marsh.
But he'll do anything if it will help him.
We don't feel it much up here in a place like Mountaincrest, but the world's a place of change.
Recently, for the first time in history, men were able to manufacture diamonds, real diamonds.
For the first time, men are making new valves for the heart and machines that can take all of a man's blood out of his body and then put it back again, while he's still breathing.
Every day, science and medicine start up new roads.
And you think Duncan Marsh is one of these new roads.
The thing is, the man who did it to Marsh, what did he have in mind?
And what kind of a future is he dreaming up for everybody else?
You two are giving me the creeps.
Doc, right now l'm too tired to look up any of those new roads of yours.
Then why don't you sleep on the couch tonight, honey, instead of going all the way home?
With all you've given me to think about l'm not sure l could sleep anywhere.
Try it.
You are going to talk to Duncan about those blood tests in the morning?
Sure.
-Providing.
-Providing?
Hey, you're a welcome sight.
Well, you're not. My bed looked much better.
No change in Marsh. He's out cold.
The guy's exhausted. l hope he stays that way till the ambulance picks him up in the morning.
Yeah.
-l'll see you in a few hours.
-Right.
He's going to be fine for us, Emery.
Get my bag and hurry.
Meet me near the jail.
Hello there.
-Who're you?
-Do you know me?
Mister, do you think if l could see, l'd be standing here?
-l'll give you a hand.
-l gotta go the other way.
Oh, wait a minute.
Aren't you the one who almost caught the wolf-man in a bear trap? l got him right in the ankle.
That's me. l'm the guy.
And do you know something else?
He broke that trap wide open.
What do you think of that?
Yeah, l hear they've got the pieces down at the sheriff's office.
-Could you show them to me?
-Certainly. The sheriff's a pal of mine.
Come on.
Whack to the ear.
Go out and get my bag.
See what condition he's in.
He's asleep.
Marsh. Quiet, Marsh! Quiet!
-lt's a scream, l tell you!
-Out to the jail!
My God.
Snap out of it, man.
That thing is loose in the village.
-Fanning, round up all the men you can get.
-Did he break loose?
Yeah. We'll need torches.
Animals are afraid of fire.
Maybe we can scare it away from the village.
Jack, l'm in a fog. What gives?
Marsh has killed Chambers and Forrest.
We can't take him alive this time, Amy.
He's killed two more men.
You can take a look at them, Doc, but l don't think it'll do much good. Come on.
Hold it a minute.
-He came this way.
-Well, it'll be light in a little while.
-Then we'll get him.
-Yeah.
Wait a minute, Jack. l can see something.
Throw some torches up there.
Hold your fire!
We're going up there after him?
No, l don't think he'll turn back now.
He's scared. l don't want to take a chance on any of these men getting hurt.
We'll wait till it's light. Let's go back.
There he is.
He's headed for the highway above the bridge. Let's try to cut him off.
Hey! Block the bridge.
Pull the scraper across the bridge.
Don't shoot. You'll hit the driver.
Shoot in front of him. Try to stop him.
Get to the other end of the bridge!
All right. Get him.
You see that? He changed back again.
-Do you think he'll stay that way this time?
-Yeah, he'll stay.
Now he can go home.
Am I dead?
You're disintegrated!
Good, does that mean we can play house now? You promised.
These woods are full of space men.
It's either them, or us. Come on.
Spaceman, you must die!
Did you say something?
He says, we must die.
Oh well... well, if you insist, but...come here.
Wouldn't it be nicer if we could live at peace with each other?
Okay, I'll be from a friendly planet.
Good! Does that mean we can play house now?
No! I'm friendly, but I still have to find out what they're doing here.
We, we are acheologists, boy.
People who try to find out what men were like way back before they could read or write.
The only way to pass on what they knew was through pictures like this one.
You see, our job is to chip it out carefully and take it to a museum, so people can study it.
Gee, are you scientists?
It's even better than being cowboys, eh professor?
You bet.
Was he a spaceman robot?
As far as we know, there were no spacemen at those times, and robots either.
He looks some of those people
I saw last time I was on Pluto.
Oh! What's your name, son?
Johnny!
Uh oh, Johnny, it looks like you've stirred a little outside of your orbit, doesn't it?
Carla!
Here we are, in the cave...
...my mother and sister.
- Bet you'd like her!
- No doubt!
Johnny, that wasn't fair!
You kids promised you'd take a nap right after lunch if we took you on this picnic, and off you scoot!
I hope he hasn't given you any trouble?
Not at all...Johnny, at the camp I used to go to, we used to have to take a nap after lunch, right up until we were fourteen.
- You did?
- Sure.
- Will you be here when I get back?
- If we are, you are welcome to join us.
Come on, come on, quit stalling.
Here dear.
There you are. Take this too, darling.
Good.
Wanna take that?
If dad was still alive,
I bet he'd let me stay.
I don't think he would, John.
Say, are we ever going to have a new father around our house?
I don't know, dear, would you like that?
If we do, I hope he's a big scientist that makes rocket ships and things like that.
Extension Ro-man, X-J-2, reporting to Guidance Ro-man.
I salute you.
You are late, fourteen minutes!
Gravitational pull is stronger than reported,
0.7652 higher than our planet.
Accepted. Report!
May I ask first for other news?
Granted. No life has been discovered on any other planets.
Earth is our only rival.
Boss, Greatness
The Hu-Man knew about atomic energy, but had not mastered the cosmic ray.
Wherever I directed the calcinator beam, they crumbled.
At first, the fools thought it came from one among their many nations.
They began destroying each other with hydrogen bombs.
I announced myself to keep them from wiping out cities, which will give our people much amusement.
Too late, they banded against me.
Their resistance pattern showed some intelligence, but all are gone now.
They way is clear for our people.
I want facts, not words!
Fact A, my pulse has been reduced to plus zero zero.
Reject! Pair off!
Pair... But great guidance, I approved it!
My energizer has scan-checked by square feet.
No life above lepidoptera level exists.
My computator is more accurate.
In the 22nd category, there is an error of sixteen billionths.
The great one is never wrong.
Then there are, perhaps, eight people left on earth?
Not perhaps.. precisely.
Find and destroy them!
Then report back.
Hey pa!
Pa.
Shh! Martha, it's all right! He's here!
Pa, what do you think!
I've a good mind to give you a thrashing, didn't we tell you, never, never, never to go outside of those wires, without our permission?
Mother(Martha), ..............................
We must tell him why.
You know the terrible things that have happened when the Ro-man landed on earth.
The only reason we are still alive is that your sister Alice and I worked out a way to reflect his deadly beams away from the house.
He can't see us, he can't hear us, but one word spoken outside the barrier, and he will be down on us.
Do you understand that, Johnny?
- But I saw him!
- Saw who?
Ro-man, he's in a cave at the end of the ravine.
- Then he's found us out.
- Not yet, or we'd all be dead by now.
Are you sure?
I was in the cave, painting his picture the way we saw him on the viewer screen.
Why were you doing that, Johnny?
So in case he did wipe out the human race, there'd be some record of how it happened.
Go on, go on!
I heard him coming, ducked out just in time.
Looked to me like he was making it his home.
Why here, why so close?
Maybe we could kill him, huh, pop?
No, Johnny.
The arms of the entire world tried, and failed.
We have thrown everything we had at him, but he is impervious.
Unless...we could find his weak spot.
Could I have just a little water, Mom?
Yes, dear.
But why here, why here?
Perhaps we're the last people on earth, dad.
He senses our presence.
He keeps calculating closer and closer.
I don't believe that.
I'm sure there were some other scientific minds capable of rigging a foil, to prevent detection.
If you only could find the way, only one way of communication with each other.
Do you think we still have a garrison on the space platform?
Ro-man hasn't destroyed that, yet.
Well... it could be.
If we only could get through to them.
But why should we succeed, where others failed.
Don't you talk like that, dear.
This may be them!
Maybe they are coming through from the space platform!
Hu-mans, listen to me!
Due to an error in calculation there are still a few of you left!
You escaped destruction because I did not know you existed!
Now I know you are watching!
I see five of you who have not been destroyed!
Show yourselves, and I promise you a painless death!
Just the five of us left? But this is incredible!
It means that Roy is gone too!
I'll bet Alice is happy, the way they used to fight!
Don't say that, Johnny.
Roy was a great scientist.
I would've never developed the serum without him.
The trouble was, he wouldn't admit I was good in my field.
Anyone who could fix that viewscreen after what that blast did to it is better than good.
Oh...easy, easy.
I'm sorry.
Seems silly after all the terrible things that have happened.
To go to pieces over one...miserable... egotistical, impossible guy!
Oh, Roy!
Do you wonder what happened to your fellows?
Watch them!
My calcinator beam wiped out your last sages, your last scientists in their deepest shelters.
Everyone but you few.
There is no escape from me.
Very well, I will recalculate...
Your death will be indescribable!
Fool hu-mans, there is no escape!
Perhaps we should talk to him, try to arrange a truce, make peace!
He would be able to plot our position immediately.
If Ro-man wants us, he should calculate us.
Have you made the correction?
I need guidance, Great One.
For the first time in my life, I am not sure.
You sound like a hu-man, not a Ro-man.
Can you not verify a fact?
I meshed my LPI with the view-screen auditor, and picked up a count of five.
Error, error!
There are eight!
Then the other three still elude me.
And all escaped detection by the directional beam.
Is it possible they have a counter-power?
And if they have?
Reduce, correlate, eliminate error!
Is this not the law?
I will find them, Great one.
Trust me!
And if the C-Ray fails,
I will use physical means.
Planet Earth can revolve once more, then you must either report success, or I will sentence you for failure.
Sh, it might be the Ro-man!
If the atomic guns can't stop him...
It's not for him...it's for us.
Hi there, anybody home?
- It's Roy!
- Yay!
- He's alive!
Do you know who's in the cave at the end of the ravine?
Ro-man!
Well then.. I, I was as close to him as I am to you!
So was I!
But he didn't know that
I was there! You know why?
- Maybe you're not worth noticing.
- Now, I know I'm in the right house.
Yes, and a moment ago, she was crying because you were dead!
Ha ha ha, you didn't have to waste any tears on me, honey, I bear a charmed life.
Ro-man spoke to us over the viewscreen.
He said that we are the last five people on Earth.
Is he lying, or are there any other people?
Two more, Jason and McCloud.
But why them?
That doesn't make sense.
Oh, doesn't it? Look, the professor here spends his entire life trying to discover a serum, an anti-biotic serum that will cure all diseases, even the common cold, and, thanks to his wise choice of assitants, he manages to achieve his goal, and so, who does he experiment on with his first injections?
Himself, his family, myself, and Jason and McCloud.
Therefore, the great anti-biotic is also the immunizer to Ro-man's death ray.
And I thought it was the electronic barricade around the house!
Well, that may prevent Ro-man from finding us and blowing us up...
...which is nothing!
...but against the sweep of the death ray, it's powerless. No, the serum, that's the thing.
Couldn't you find any more in the lab?
- Plenty! But I didn't bring it.
- Why?
Because we managed to get together enough fuel to take a rocket ship to the space platform, and there's enough serum on board to immunize the entire garrison there.
Does the garrison know you're coming?
How could I tell them without letting Ro-man know too?
They know what's going on down here... they'll figure it's Ro-man and blast the ship right out of the sky.
We'll have to get word to the space platform, that's all.
Jason and McCloud take off in two days.
On foot, it would take me longer than that to get back there.
We'll have to re-wire the circuits on the viewscreen, so that we can broadcast without
Ro-man picking it up.
But such a complicated job in two days?
Well, at least I can try.
If I only had a decent assistant, who could take orders, instead of trying to be the boss!
I'm bossy? You're so bossy you ought to be milked before you come home at night!
- Children, children!
- All right, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Professor.
Okay, boss, where do I begin?
- Don't you have to loop it?
- Roy, will you not argue, please?
You know something?
You're either too beautiful to be so smart, or too smart to be so beautiful.
I guess we do get along all right, at that.
But, let's work together now.
We can play later.
- Roy, what time is it?
- Four-thirty.
And what day, Roy?
I can't remember the day!
I'm so tired.
There...
There. Oh Roy, we'll never make it!
I can't control my hands any more!
- Let's rest a little.
- Oh, but we can't.
Roy's right...it's time you get some sleep.
Jiminy, two days you've been at it!
Oh, not that long, it can't be that long!
The rocket ship must have taken off at dawn.
They're either in the air by now, or...
Then I've failed you then.
I'm sorry, Dad.
Failed, do you realize what you tried to do was impossible, yet you almost did it?
But I didn't!
Hu-mans!
Yesterday I calculated five of you!
Now, I find six.
He still doesn't know about
Jason and McCloud!
There were eight of you, the guidance Ro-man who understands everything showed me that, yet I might have had trouble locating the other two, had they not taken off in a rocket ship and revealed their presence.
Look, hu-mans!
They are headed for the space platform, which guidance Ro-man spared because it would have been a convenience for my people when they arrive on Earth.
The space platform!
But now we shall destroy that too.
Alert!
Ten, nine, eight... the Great One himself sends the cosmic blast that atomizes the rocket ship.. the space platform...
Hu-mans seven and eight, all!
And now, of the two billion, there are six.
Calculate your chances...
Negative. Negative. Negative.
Is there a choice between a painless surrender death, and the horror of resistance death?
Show yourselves!
By your clock-time, in one hour I seek you out.
Last warning!
Mommy, why doesn't he like people?
I don't know, darling... perhaps if we could talk to him... you'd better go and rest, too.
George, we can't go on this way much longer!
Our food is almost gone.
What else can we do?
Commit suicide, or give in to Ro-man, as the last people on Earth?
George, talk to him, make him see that we won't harm him...
..he can let us live.
If Alice could've finished re-wiring the viewscreen, you could have talked to the platform without Ro-man discovering our presence,
- why can't you talk directly to him?
- I could. Of course I could.
As soon as Alice has had her sleep, I will.
Not like that!
Alice, look. You simply can't connect these two circuits.
Here, let me.
Ro-man, Ro-man!
Do you scan us on your viewscreen?
Yes, earth-man, I see you.
This means only one thing: you have decided to take the easy way out.
No, Ro-man. We have fought you to a stand-still.
And we will go on doing it, as long as necessary.
If you try to figure out our position, you are wasting your time.
None shall escape me!
I shall find a way to rid this earth's planets... of hu-mans!
No!
We humans will not give up this earth of ours.
But let me ask you something else.
What do you have to fear from us?
Let me show you the six people you want to destroy.
First, my wife Martha.
My companion for twenty-three years.
Is there anything to fear from this woman?
The hu-man wo-man is the bringer of hu-man life!
There must be an end to your race!
Or my children...
Alice.
No. I have a mission to perform.
Carla.
I am built to have no emotions.
And Johnny.
The boy is impertinent!
Or is it in the ettiquette code of your people, that children must be murdered?
You are not like my people.
You are savage barbarians, non Ro-man, animals!
Take my assistant, Roy who has developed a serum with me, which would have wiped out disease among my people.
Wait.
There is something I do not understand, quite.
But I want to see the girl A-lice again.
We want peace, Ro-man.
But peace with honor.
I will talk with the girl.
It is not in the plan, but although I cannot verify it,
I feel that she will understand.
No!
I am the head of this family unit.
You have to talk with me!
Calculate, hu-man!
If I meet with the girl, I may find a way to integrate you into the plan!
It is not a fact, but what you would call... a hope!
Name the place, Ro-man...
I will be there!
I do not understand... but it is only the one called A-lice that I want to see.
Here I am, Ro-man.
Where shall we meet?
Do you know the area of the fork of the two dry rivers?
There is a ruin there.
I will meet you in an hour.
- But you must be...alone.
- I will be there.
You will not.
Have you gone crazy?
- We've played every other card, why not try this one?
- Do you realize what you're doing?
If there's a chance I can strike a better bargain than father, then I'm the one to go.
Is Alice gonna have a date with Ro-man?
This is madness, Alice!
Roy, you have to speak to her!
I know I'm not in the family,
Alice, but your father's right.
You mean, there are certain things nice girls don't do?
Even if it means that man's millions of years of struggle up from the sea, the slime, to fight to breathe air, to stand erect, to think, to conquer nature, to be stopped cold by a doting father and a jealous suitor?
I just don't think that any human being should degrade himself in order to survive.
You'd rather just have us go out of business, is that it? Letter returned, no forwarding address.
Can't you see you're being sentimental idiots, letting your emotions run away with you?
Perhaps that is the quality of being human.
The very thing that makes us different from Ro-man.
The difference we are trying to preserve.
Very pretty talk... but I still intend to do something about it.
- Get out of my way.
- You're not going.
- I said get out of my way!
- And I said you're not going!
Johnny! Johnny!
- Johnny is gone!
- You don't think he'd be outside in that?
Oh, that fool romantic kid will try anything!
What a family I have!
I wouldn't do anything!
Johnny has left the barricade.
He might have it in his head to find Ro-man.
We have to stop him.
Don't worry, Professor.
Alice and I can find him.
I'll go, of course, but don't either of you speak to me!
But be careful of Ro-man!
When Johnny comes back, I will set off a flare.
Right.
What are you doing here, boy?
My sister isn't coming.
So they sent you?
I came by myself.
I wanted to find out what you had against me.
You are hu-man. Your people were getting too intelligent.
We could not wait until you were strong enough to attack us.
We had to attack you first.
I think you're just a big bully, picking on people smaller than you are.
Now, I will kill you.
You look like a pooped-out pinwheel!
So...the calcinator death ray
REALLY cannot harm you.
Your father must be a brilliant scientist.
He's got a super-serum that keeps people from ever getting sick.
How do you know it works?
Cause he tried it on me and Carla and Alice and Roy...and everybody.
And we don't get sick even when we swallow capsules with real bad bugs in 'em.
And the two men who took off on the rocket ship?
They also had this injection?
Sure, they...
You have told me all I need to know.
I will calculate the spectrum dust in the calcinator death ray, to counteract this antibiotic.
And you will all be destroyed.
George! George, there he is!
He looks all right!
Oh thank God, thank God!
Johnny!
Johnny!
Where did you go?
There, there, darling.
It's all right.
Now, tell us all about it.
No it isn't, ma.
I gave it all away!
- I didn't mean to, but I did.
- You did what?
I wanted to talk to Ro-man, but he got out of me how we were protected from the death ray, and now he's gonna do something about it.
It's all right, boy.
You did right.
And Ro-man won't find it easy to counteract the serum, so we have still a little time left.
I only wish it were over now.
Well, when it is, can I go over to
Janey's house and borrow her dolls?
Yes, er, of course, darling.
- Is Johnny safe?
- Shh. Ro-man........................................
Oh! What has kept you two?
- We were worried!
- Now, really, father, isn't it obvious?
Have you been playing house?
Professor, uh, it may sound silly to you, but...
Alice and I want to get married, and we were wondering how you'd feel about performing the ceremony.
- You want me to...
- Oh, yes!
In that case, let's do it!
And I want you to know... this is the biggest social event of the year!
The whole darn town will turn out!
Great guidance,
I have discovered the secret of our failure to destroy the remaining hu-mans!
Our C-ray... the calcinator death ray..cannot penetrate them.
They have been made immune through the anti-biotic serum, which I believe is the same as our formula X-Z-A.
Reduce their counterpart!
Eliminate the error!
Death to hu-mans can come by force!
I will use physical means, Great One.
The plan shall be fulfilled.
The planet Earth has half-revolved!
You have but a short time to achieve our goal!
All right.
Places!
Go!
Dearly beloved, we are gathered here to...
Dear Lord.
You know that I am not trained for this job.
But I have tried to live by your laws.
The ten commandments... the beatitudes... the golden rule.
I would like you to look down, on Alice and Roy, and give your blessing.
Even in this darkest hour, we have kept the faith.
In your grand design, there may be no room for man's triumph over this particular evil that has beset us.
But if by any chance, victory should be on our side,
I want you to give a long life to Alice and Roy, and a fruitful one.
But no matter how it ends, Lord, watch over them this night... watch over us all.
Amen.
And now, I pronounce you “Man, and Wife.”
Roy, do you have the ring?
Why, I didn't think about that.
Oh, brother...
Are you going to have to pick up after him!
I wanted you to have it, some day, Alice.
With this ring, I thee wed.
The only thing to seal it now, is a kiss.
Where are you going on your honeymoon, Niagara Falls?
Well, to tell the truth, we hadn't thought about that.
Wherever you go... be careful.
And I want you back, the first thing in the morning.
And in case you don't know, there is a war going on!
And now, more than ever,
I don't want to give up!
Thanks for everything, dad.
Most of all, for having raised Alice.
You too, mom.
I'll go get my things, and then we'll go.
She ought to have some flowers, it isn't right!
Roy, Alice, wait for me!
Carla, what are you doing here?
I didn't get you any presents.
Oh, you little rascal!
Thank you very much.
- Now, you'd better run right on home!
- Quickly, Carla.
What are you doing here alone, girl-child?
My daddy won't let you hurt me.
We'll see!
Great guidance, I have a favorable report.
I have already eliminated one of them.
Force was necessary it was a simple matter of...strangulation.
That leaves four.
Error again! Five.
Four and one more, on whom I have made an estimate, in relation to our strategic reserve.
The plan should include one living human for reference, in case of unforseen contingency.
Do you question the plan?
No, great one. I only postulate...
Proceed on schedule!
Destroy the others.
All of them!
Carla!
Carla!
No! No! No!
Shh! He will hear you!
I don't care! I don't care!
You must care!
You must not give up!
I am ordered to kill you.
I must do it with my hands.
How is it you're so strong, Ro-man?
It seems impossible!
We Ro-mans obtain our strength from the planet Ro-man, relayed our individual energizers.
- Small enough to carry with you?
- No, mine is in the cave.
I wish now I'd played house with her more often when she wanted to.
No regrets, Johnny.
We enjoyed her as long as she was with us, and now, somehow, we have to find a way to live without her.
Roy! Where's Alice?
Ro-man's...
Ro-man's got her!
Roy is dead...
And nothing can be done. Nothing!
Maybe one of us could lure him out for a moment, and then the others could run in and grab Alice.
That's easier said than done!
He'd come if he could be sure of killing us.
Go on! Go on!
We call him on the viewer screen.
Tell him we don't want to fight anymore.
He can get us in the ravine if he promises easy death.
You slip in and grab Alice when he comes out after me.
It might work!
There's no time to lose.
Suppose I were hu-man.
Would you treat me like, a man?
No, Ro-man...
You haven't told me yet where the energizer is kept.
Silence, girl!
Why do you call me at this time?
Ro-man, we can't stand it any longer.
I have made my last offer.
You promised us a painless death, if we give ourselves up.
Come and get us!
You can wait. Call me again at another time.
No! We will meet you half-way.
In the ravine!
All right!
I will meet you in the ravine, when the sun passes over the mountains.
Attention! Attention, extension X-J-2!
Attention! Attention, extension X-J-2!
We hear you, great guidance.
Earth Ro-man, you violate the law of plan.
Fact: you have captured the girl and not destroyed her.
Fact: you have delayed accepting the surrender of the others.
This verges on failure.
There is one thing you do not understand, Great Guidance.
You reject the plan?
I wish to make an estimate of my own!
To think for yourself is to be like the hu-man.
Yes...to be like the hu-man.
To laugh, feel, want... why are these things not in the plan?
You are an extension of the ro-men.
And a Ro-man, you will remain.
Now, I set you into motion.
One: destroy the girl.
Two: destroy the family.
Fail, and I will destroy you.
I cannot, and yet I must.
How do you calculate that?
At what point on the graph do
“must” and “cannot” meet?
Yet, I must. But I cannot.
Attention! Attention extension X-J-2!
Speak, great guidance.
Why have you not killed the girl?!
I must, but I cannot.
Here I am, Ro-man!
The girl first, then the boy! Now!
Great guidance, I cannot kill the girl, but I will kill the boy.
Here I am!
A-lice, do not hate me...
I must!
You wish to be a hu-man?
Good, you can die a hu-man!
Human elements still roam planet Earth!
I, the ruler of all Ro-mans, shall complete your task, earth Ro-man.
I shall release our cosmic Q-rays!
This will bring prehistoric reptiles to devour whatever remains of life!
The cyclotronic vibrations will smash the planet earth out of the universe!
Found him!
Take it easy, son, you're all right.
- How is he?
- He's all right.
We just want to make sure you get up with everything you fell down with.
Hey, I found him!
That's quite a bump there, boy.
What happened?
Huh?
Darling! Are you all right?
- You gave your mother quite a scare!
- Yes!
Here it was getting dark, and no Johnny!
- You're alive?
- Yeah.
Her, too?
Boy, was that a dream, or was it!
I must try and repay you for all the trouble you've gone to... won't you and your assistant join us for dinner?
- Do!
- Done!
Will you play house with me when we get home?
Well... oh, all right.
But I gotta keep an eye out for Ro-man!
Really, Johnny. You're overdoing this spaceman act.
There simply aren't any such things.
Come on, dear. This way.

Criswell Predicts...
Greetings, my friend. We are all interested in the future, for that is where you and I are going to spend the rest of our lives.
And remember my friend, future events such as these will affect you in the future.
You are interested in the unknown, the mysterious, the unexplainable.
That is why you are here.
And now, for the first time, we are bringing to you the full story of what happened on that fateful day.
We are giving you all the evidence, based only on the secret testimonies of the miserable souls who survived this terrifying ordeal. The incidents, the places, my friend we cannot keep this a secret any longer.
Let us punish the guilty, let us reward the innocent. My friend, can your heart stand the shocking facts about grave robbers from outer space?
Plan 9 From Outer Space
All of us on this earth, know that there is a time to live, and that there is a time to die, yet death is always a shock to those left behind.
It is even more of a shock,when death, the proud brother, comes suddenly without warning.
Just at sundown, a small group, gathered in silent prayer around the newly-opened grave of the beloved wife of an elderly man.
Sundown of the day, yet also the sundown of the old man's heart, for the shadows of grief clouded his very reason.
The funeral over, the saddened group left the graveside.
It was when the gravediggers started their task that strange things began to take place.
Fifteen to four.
Yup, right on schedule. There's the ol' San Fernando Valley out there now.
-You better radio in for landing instructions, Danny.
-Right, Jeff.
Burbank Tower, this is American 
Flight 812, over.
Wouldn't surprise me any if  he's asleep this time of the morning.
American Flight 812, this is Burbank Tower.
If I were asleep you'd never get on the ground !
Your case maybe you'd be up there for good. Over.
You got me that time, Mac.
This American Flight 812 requesting -
Burbank Tower to American Flight 812, over.
Burbank Tower to American Flight 812, over.
Holy mackeral.
-Burbank Tower to American Flight 812, are you in trouble?
-Trouble ?
-Take a look for yourself.
-What in the world...
-That's nothing from this world.
Burbank Tower to American Flight 812, are you in trouble? Are you in trouble?
-Mayday, mayday. Stand by, Burbank Tower.
-Do you suppose the passengers saw it?
I doubt it. Most of them are asleep.
But it was quite a jolt, Jeff. I'll check.
Good. We'll get them ready for landing.
Keep it quiet until we get instructions.
-Right.
-American Flight 812 reporting to Burbank Tower, over.
-D'you hear anything ?
-I thought I did.
Don't like hearin' noises.
'Specially when there ain't s'posed to be any.
-Yeah, sorta spooky-like.
-Maybe we're getting' old.
-Whatever it is it's gone now.
-That's the best thing for us too. Gone.
-Yeah, let's go.
The grief of his wife's death became greater and greater agony.
The home they had so long shared together, became a tomb.
A sweet memory of her joyous living.
The sky to which she had once looked, was now only a covering for her dead body.
The ever-beautiful flowers she had planted with her own hand, became nothing more than the lost roses of her cheeks.
Confused by his great loss, the old man left that home, never to return again.
At the funeral of the old man, unknown to his mourners, his dead wife was watching.
-First his wife, then he.
-Tragic.
-Tell me something. Why was his wife buried in the ground, and he sealed in a crypt?
-Something to do with family tradition.
A superstition of some sort.
Well, it's getting' dark. We'd best be on our way.
Then, as two of his mourners left his final resting place.
Minutes later, the police, lead by Inspector Daniel Clay, arrived at the scene.
-Who found him ?
-The man and girl.
-Medical, uh, examiner been 'round yet?
-Just left.
The morgue wagon oughta be along most any time.
-You get their statement ?
Yeah, much as we could. They're pretty scared.
-Finding a mess like this oughta make anyone frightened.
Have one of the boys take the guy and the girl back to town. You take charge.
-Okay Inspector. What're you gonna do?
-Look around a little.
-Pretty dark out there.
Once you get beyond those lights you won't be able to see your hand in front of your face.
-I will get one of the flashlights from the patrol car.
-You be careful Clay.
-I'm a big boy now, Johnny.
Looks like a bobcat tore through them.
Yeah.
Say Lieutenant, d'you get that funny odour ?
-How could I miss it ?
Oh, that'll be the morgue wagon now.
-That's the fifth siren in the last hour.
-Oh, something's happened down at the cemetery. A lot of police cars and lights. 
I stopped but I didn't see anything.
Oh well, whatever it is, the morning paper will carry the whole story.
You seem to still be up there somewhere.
Maybe I am.
I don't think I've ever seen you in this mood before.
I guess it's because I've never been in this mood before.
Something about your flight ?
Yeah.
What happened, Jeff ?
-I saw a flying saucer.
-A saucer ?
You mean the kind from up there ?
-Yeah, or its counterpart.
 I was shaped like a huge cigar.
Dan [something] saw it too.
When it passed over, the whole compartment lighted up with a blinding glare. 
Then there was a tremendous wind that practically knocked us off our course.
-Well did you report it ?
-Yeah, radioed in immediately and they said well keep it quiet until you land.
Then as soon as we landed, big army brass grabbed us and made us swear to secrecy about the whole thing.
Oh, it burns me up. These things have been seen for years.
They're here, it's a fact.
And the public oughta know about it.
-There must be something more you can do about it.
Oh no there isn't.
Oh, but what's the point of making a fuss.
Last night I saw a flying object that couldn't possibly have been from this planet.
But I can't say a word. I'm muzzled by army brass!
I can't even admit I saw the thing!
Sounds like Clay's in trouble.
Bet that apparition we saw had something to do with it. 
Come on.
-Is he dead ?
-Yeah.
He's messed up as bad as those two back there.
S'pose that saucer or whatever it was had something to do with this?
Your guess is as good as mine, Larry.
But one thing's sure. Inspector Clay is dead... murdered...and somebody's responsible!
You're in charge now, Lieutenant.
-Yeah, guess I am. Kelton. 
-Yes Sir ?
Get back up to the car and get on the radio.
Tell the coroner he's gotta make another trip out here.
Well how 'bout the lab boys ?
Well who do you think we left back at the car, boy scouts ? Come on, Larry.
Greater love hath no man, than to lay down his life for another.
It is always difficult to have last words over the grave of a friend.
And Inspector Daniel Clay was a friend.
A dear friend to me and to all of us.
The bell has rung upon his great career.
Now we lay him to rest. A rest well deserved, but so premature.
People turning south from the freeway were startled when they saw flying saucers high over Hollywood Boulevard.
A woman, startled by the sight in the sky, telephones the police.
There comes a time in each man's life, when he can't even believe his own eyes.
Saucers seen over Hollywood!
Flying saucers seen over Washington D.C.
The army convoy moved into the field.
Rockets were quickly set up.
Colonel Tom Edwards, in charge of saucer field activities, was to make the greatest decision of his career.
He made that decision. Colonel Edwards gave the signal to fire.
Then as swiftly as they had come, they were gone.
Even to the piercing eye of radar and the speeding jet fighters.
-Quite a sight, wasn't it Sir.
-A sight I'd rather not be seeing.
-Are you worried about them Sir ?
Well, they must have a reason for their visits.
Visits? Well that would indicate visitors!
Are big guns the usual way of welcoming visitors?
We haven't always fired at them.
For a time we tried to contact them by radio, but no response.
Then they attacked a town. A small town, I'll admit.
But nevertheless a town of people. 
People who died.
-I never heard about that Sir.
Well, it was covered up by the higher echelon. Take any fire, any earthquake, any major disaster, then wonder.
Flying saucers, Captain, are still a rumour. 
Officially.
Looks like we beat them off again Sir.
What do they want...where are they from...where are they going...
They, Sir ? Who ?
Oh, this is a training manoeuver, Sir. 
We only did a little practice firing at the clouds.
Yeah. I wonder what their next move will be.
What will their next move be ?
Your space commander has returned from Earth.
Send him in.
You have your report ?
We had to pull in here to 
Space Station 7 for regeneration.
We're returning to the planet Earth immediately thereafter.
-What progress has been made ?
-We contacted government officials.
They refuse over existence.
What plan will you follow now ?
Plan 9. It's been absolutely impossible to work through these Earth creatures. 
Their soul is too controlled.
Plan 9...ah yes. Plan 9 deals with the resurrection of the dead.
Long-distance electrodes shot into the pinion pituitary glands of recent dead.
Have you attempted any of this plan as yet ?
-Yes Excellency.
How successful has it been ?
We have risen two so far.
We shall be just as successful on more.
The living...they have no suspicion of your movements ?
We had to dispose of one policeman.
However, none of those risen have been seen. 
At least, not by anyone who still remains alive.
It's too bad it must be handled this way. However it must.
Those who take from the grave will lead the way for our other operations.
Yes, Excellency.
-Continue on. Report to me in two Earth days.
I feared His Excellency wouldn't take our report this well.
Well had he been dealing with our own people his reaction would have been completely different.
He understands the difficulties of the Earth race.
What do you think will be the next obstacle the Earth people will put in our way?
Well, as long as they can think we'll have our problems.
But those whom we're using cannot think. They are the dead.
Brought to a simulated life by our electrode guns.
You know, it's an interesting think when you consider...the Earth people, who can think, are so frightened by those who cannot: the dead.
Well our ship should be regenerated. We better get started.
I still think you oughta go in town and stay with your mother until I get back.
This is our home and nothing's going to take me from it.
Besides, most men try and keep their wives from going home to Momma. 
-That's not the point.
-That's all the point there's going to be.
Now toddle off and fly your flying machine, Darling.
But if you see any more flying saucers, will you tell them to pick another house to buzz?
Don't worry about me.
Oh you're the only thing I do worry about. Oh forget about the flying saucers.
They're up there. But there's something in that cemetery, and that's too close for comfort.
The saucers are up there. And the cemetery's out there.
But I'll be locked up in there. Now off to your wild blue yonders.
You promise you'll lock the doors immediately ?
I promise. Besides, I'll be in bed before half an hour is gone, with your pillow beside me.
-My pillow ?
Well, I have to have something to keep me company while you're away.
Sometimes in the night when it does get a little lonely,
I reach over and touch it, then it doesn't seem so lonely anymore. 
A crazy kid.
I do love you, Darlin'.
See you Thursday.
-Goodbye, Honey.
You know I'm not leaving here until you're locked safely inside.
All right, Darling.
If you're especially nice I may even lock the side door.
And be sure you keep the yard lights on.
You're mighty silent this trip, Jeff.
You haven't spoken ten words since takeoff. 
I guess I'm preoccupied, Danny.
We've got thirty-three passengers back there that have time to be preoccupied. 
Flying this flybird doesn't give you that opportunity. 
I guess you're right, Danny.
-Paula ?
-Yeah.
-There's nothing wrong between you two ?
-Oh no, nothing like that.
Just that I'm worried, she being there alone and those strange things flying over the house and those incidents in the graveyard the past few days. It's just got me worried.
Well, I haven't figured out those crazy skybirds yet but I give you fifty to one odds the police have figured out that cemetery thing by now.
-I hope so.
-If you're really that worried Jeff why don't you radio in and find out?
Mac should be on duty at the field by now. 
He could call Paula and relay the message to you. 
-Hi Edith.
-Hi Silents. I haven't heard a word from this end of the plane since we left the field.
Jeff's been giving me and himself a study in silence.
-You boys are feudin'?
-Oh no Edie, nothing like that.
Hey Edie, how about you and me balling [bawling?] it up in Albuquerque ?
Albuquerque ? Have you read that flight schedule Boy ?
-What about it ?
We land in Albuquerque at 4 am. That's strictly a nine o'clock town.
Well I know a friend that'll help us --
-Let's have a problem first, huh Danny. [?]
-Ah he's worried about Paula.
I read about that cemetery business.
I tried to get you kids to not buy too near one of those things.
He thought it'd be quiet and peaceful there.
No doubt about that.
It's quiet alright, like a tomb.
I'm sorry Jeff, that was a bad joke.
Say., I almost forgot what I came in here for.
How's the coffee situation?
-Mmmm that's for me.
-That sure wouldn't hurt anything, Edie.
Okay, I'll be right back. And say Jeff, make that call to your wife. 
Huh, not only will she throw water on my Albuquerque plan but now she's repeating herself.
-How 'bout that Albuquerque ball ?
-I can't resist your charm, Danny Boy.
Residents near the cemetery paid little attention to the blast of thunder and the flash of lightning. 
But from the blast, arose the moving figure of the dead old man. 
Hello ? Who ?
Mac ? Well, hi Mac !
Sure I'm all right.
I just fell asleep.
Tell Jeff I'm all right.
Okay Mac. Thanks for calling. Goodnight.
Mrs. Trent ! Mrs. Trent ! What's wrong ?
They'll be at the hatch in a moment.
You can open it now, Tanna.
Turn off the electrodes quickly.
They can't tell us from anyone else.
It's tough to find something when you don't know what you're looking for.
-I don't think the Lieutenant does either.
-Then what're doing out here? I was off duty an hour ago.
Ah don't ask me any questions. I'm just a hardhand [hat? head?] just like you.
What do you suppose that noise was?
Whatever it was it's no more strange than the other things happening around this cemetery.
Spirits like Old Farmer Caulder talked about.
-Heh. Maybe.
-The only spirits he saw tonight were those I smelled on his breath.
Well don't forget Mrs. Trent claims to have seen them too.
She didn't have anything on her breath.
-She was hysterical.
-Well true, she was frightened, and in a state of shock.
But, don't forget that torn nightgown and the scratched feet.
Yeah I hadn't thought of that.
I guess that's why you're a detective lieutenant and I'm still a uniformed cop. 
Sometimes it's only the breaks, Larry. In the meantime let's get-
-Lieutenant, Lieutenant ! Did you hear that ?
-How could we help it ?
-It sure was strange.
-Know what it was ?
-No more than you do.
-If it weren't for orders I'd get out of here right now.
-It was a saucer.
-A flying saucer ? What makes you say that ?
You remember the noise we heard the other night ?
We were knocked to the ground, how could I forget ?
Exactly, but you're not remembering that sound.
There you're wrong, Lieutenant.
I'm with a fact the sound is similar, but what about the blinding light?
Well haven't you heard ?
Many times a saucer hasn't had a glow, or a light of any kind for that matter.
-That proves it. What next Lietenant ?
Maybe this doesn't mean much, but uh Jamie and me found a grave that looks like it's been busting into.
-What ? Where ?
-Why uh why...
-Come on man out with it, we haven't got all day to waste.
-Uh, just over there beyond the crypt.
-All right, show us the way !
Look, here it is Lieutenant.
Ah it's been broken into all right.
Strange. If someone had broken in, the dirt should be piled up here somewhere. 
It looks like it's fallen in into the grave.
-Larry you'll be out of that uniform before you know it.
-Do we have the right to look down there Lieutenant ?
-Ah, technically no.
Well, this spot looks familiar, though.
We shouldn't investigate any further without the permission of  next of kin.
Let's go get it !
-How ?
-I see what you mean, the gravestone's down there.
Well, let's go down and find out who's grave it is.
-How ?
-By going down and finding out !
-Are you sure you mean that Lieutenant ?
-If I didn't mean it I wouldn't have said it.
-Scared ?
-Well, why do I always get hooked up with these spook details?
Monsters, graves, bodies,... oooh all right.
Casket's here, but nobody's in it.
Can you read the name on the casket?
It's too dark. Give me a flashlight.
-How 'bout a match ?
-We sure could try it. Let me have them !
It's Inspector Clay's grave !
Be he ain't in it!
But meanwhile, in the Pentagon, in Washington DC...
Try G2...
...come in !
Yes of course, I'll keep in touch.
Come in, Colonel Edwards. Close the door. At ease, Colonel.
-Thank you, Sir.
-Sit down.
I understand, Colonel, you've been on tap for many of our saucer attacks.
I'm in charge of field operations, Sir.
You believe there are such things as flying saucers, Colonel ?
-Yessir.
-You've seen them ?
Yessir.
You realize there's a government directive stating that there is no such thing as a flying saucer?
Yessir.
Do you stand by your statement that you've seen flying saucers ?
Well, uh... yessir.
This could mean a court marshall. Admitting this against direct orders.
General Roberts, may I speak freely ?
-You may.
How could I hope to hold down my command if I didn't believe in what I saw and shot at? 
-I, uh, like you Colonel.
-Thank you, Sir.
There are flying saucers.
There's no doubt they are in our skies.
They've been there for some time. 
What're we going to do about them ?
-Who knows ?
-Then, uh, they really are there ?
-I thought you were convinced of that !
-I am.
We've had contact with them.
-Contact ? How ?
-Radio.
-They speak our language ?
-Well not quite.
We  received messages from their space ships.
For a while it came in as just a lot of jumbled noise.
And now, Sir ?
Well since they first uh tried contact with us by radio, we've developed a language computer. 
A machine that breaks down any language to our own. 
General, uh,  what's this all got to do with me?
Well you've been in charge of saucer field activity for a long while.
I think it's about time you heard these recordings. Do you mind?
Mind ? Huh, I'm anxious !
This is Eros, a space soldier from a planet of your galaxy.
I fully realize our language differences, however I also know you finally have perfected the dictorobitary, or as you on Earth put it, the language computer. So you can now understand that which I speak.
Since the beginning of your time, we have been far beyond your planet.
It has taken you centuries to even grasp what we developed eons of your years ago.
Do you still believe it impossible we exist?
You didn't actually think you were the only inhabited planet in the universe?
How can any race be so stupid ?
Permit me to set your mind at ease.
We do not want to conquer your planet. Only save it.
We could have destroyed it long ago, if that had been our aim.
Our principal purpose is friendly.
I admit, we have had to take certain means which you might refer to as criminal, but that is because of your big guns which have destroyed some of our representatives.
If you persist in denying us our landings, then we must only accept that you do not want us on friendly terms.
We then have no alternative but to destroy you before you destroy us.
With your ancient, juvenile minds, you have developed explosives too fast for your minds to conceive what you were doing.
You are on the verge of destroying the entire universe.
We are part of that universe.
This is our last -
That's the end of that one.
Atmospheric conditions in outer space often interfere with transmitting.
How many of these recordings do you have General ?
An even dozen up to now. This was the last one.
We received it over a month ago.
-Do you think they mean business ?
-We can't afford to take any chances.
Come over here. You ever been to Hollywood ?
-Oh a couple of times. A few years ago.
-You're going to be there in the morning.
Just a few minutes from Hollywood, in the town of San Fernando, reports have come in of saucers flying so low the exhaust  knocked people to the ground.
There have even been stated claims of saucer landings.
Major Carlson will replace you while you're out there.
You're the best man for the job of attempting to contact them.
Find them, Colonel. See what in hell it is they want!
All right, Sir.
These are confidential reports, Colonel.
Read them over carefully on the plane, turn them over to intelligence when you get to Los Angeles.
They'll have further orders for disposition.
Yessir.
-Colonel Edwards ?
-Yessir ?
-Good luck.
-Thank you, Sir.
We are ready to report, Excellency.
-You are many days late.
-It was unavoidable.
We tried to transmit via televisor, but atmospheric conditions made transmission impossible.
-You should have transmitted as soon as conditions permitted.
-I thought time was of the essence.
Suspicion  has fallen upon our movements.
Our ships have been viewed near the point of operations.
And what has this extra time gained, Eros?
We have successfully risen three of the dead ones.
-Permit me to see one.
-Bring in the big one.
Use your small electrode gun.
I have taken two ships from your command.
But...that will leave only my ship !
It is necessary that you continue your mission alone.
I have need of your other ships elsewhere.
Even though you have risen three of the Earth dead, the plan is far from successful, and you Eros, must prove it an operational success before more time, energy, and ships, may be spent on it.
We will not fail. Everything is on our side.
Not everything ! 
You do not have the live Earth people !
You report that your ship was viewed at scene of your present operations ?
That is correct.
They have been viewed many times, but not at the scene of operations.
Something must be done about that.
Stop him Tanna ! He's close enough ! Turn off your electrode gun !
No ! No ! Stop him Tanna !
I can't get it, it's jammed !
-Stop him you fool !
Drop the gun to the floor, Tanna !
The metal will break contact!
[Gasping] That was too close !
Yes.
Bring the giant here that I may get a better look at him. 
Yes, he's a fine specimen.
Are they all this powerful on planet Earth ?
This one is an exception, Excellency.
-What are the other two like ?
-One is a woman, the other an old man.
-An old man, you say ?
-Yes, Excellency.
This gives me a plan. Put the big one away.
Pick up your electrode gun.
Make sure it's in working order before pointing it at him.
Whatever made it jam must have been cleared by the fall.
Take him back to the ship.
The old one must be sacrificed. Re-land on Earth.
Send the old one to enter a dwelling.
Then cut off the electrokinetic and turn on your ship's decomposure ray.
The result will astound those watching. Astound them enough to delay their attention until you have gained your other recruits from the cemetery.
Yes, Excellency. It'll be done.
Report to me when this has been accomplished.
Eros, the Earth people are getting to that which we fear.
Since they will not listen or respect our existence, they cannot help but believe our powers when they see their own dead walking 'round again, brought about by our advancement in such things. As soon as you have enough of the dead recruits, march them on the capitals of the Earth, let nothing stand in your way. Their own dead will be used to make them accept our existence, and believe in that fact.
Mr. and Mrs. Trent...this is Colonel Edwards from Washington DC.
-Good evening, Colonel.
-Hello Colonel. 
Colonel would like to ask you a few questions.
-Questions ? What about, Colonel ?
-May I, uh, sit down ?
Oh, I'm sorry, please do.
I want to ask you about your strange experience the other night, when you saw the flying saucer.
After that the police brought me home.
I hope I never see such a sight again.
Well after your description I don't think I'd want to see it either.
One thing more...after you were forced to the ground by that blast of wind, was it a hot or cold blast?
-It's kind of hard to explain.
It wasn't hot, wasn't cold, it was just a terrific force. We-we couldn't get off the ground. 
The light blinded me so badly I couldn't see a thing.
We could only feel the pressure of the wind, until it was gone.
When the glare left us, we could see a glowing ball disappearing off in the distance.
-Which way ?
-Toward the cemetery.
This is the most fantastic story I've ever heard.
And every word of it's true, too.
That's the fantastic part of it.
We found a lot of suspicious things out in that cemetery.
Then again, didn't find anything to base a fact or suspicion on.
Hey, do you hear anything.
You see anything out there Kelton ?
Too dark, Lieutenant.
But something's started stinking awful bad.
There's something out there.
-What do you make of that ?
-You got me ! It didn't look that way a minute ago.
-What about your man ?
-Oh, in the excitement I forgot all about Kelton.
Oh, he'll be all right in a few minutes.
-Did you see that thing ? Did you get it ?
-We got it.
What was it ? It didn't fall...I fired every bullet I had.
So did I. I don't know what it was or what happened, but unless that bag of bones can reassemble itself, it's out of the running now.
Colonel I've been out here so often you'd think I'd taken a lease on this place.
Not a long lease, I hope.
I see what you mean. But you know, I can't help but feel the answer's out here somewhere.
Is the uh girl safe ?
Mrs. Trent you'd better stay with the car.
-Stay here alone? Not on your life.
-Modern women...
-Yeah, they been that way all down through the ages.
Especially in a spot like this.
-Kelton ! -Yessir ?
-Stay with Mrs. Trent.
All right, Lieutenant.
-Now you stay close to the officer, Honey.
-I'd feel safer with you.
-Now the Lieutenant knows best.
-Oh I don't like it, but I guess there isn't much I can do about it.
-You have a gun ?
-No.
Know how to use one ?
After four years in the Marine Corps ?
-Here.
-You think we'll need these ?
You can never tell. Let's get going.
-What do you expect to find out here ?
-Well there's only one answer to that Mr. Trent, we'll know when we find it. Inspector Clay's grave is right over here.
-Is that the one you told me was broken into ?
-Yes.
-This it ?
-Yeah.
Looks to me like someone had broken out instead of in.
-I figured that, but that's impossible ! -I wonder.
-Look, Colonel, some things just can't happen.
Yeah well after that apparition that was draped across Mr. Trent's patio, I would say we should keep our minds open to anything. 
Look, Colonel, I'm a policeman. I've got to deal in facts.
But, I guess I'll have to go along with you.  You know I bet my badge right now we haven't seen the last of those weirdies.
-They'll discover our ship soon.
-You going to let them find us ?
It's the only way. These are the same men who have been so close so often.
They must be halted before they can inform others about us.
-But there were others in the car !
-They'll be taken too.
Send the big one to get the girl and the policeman. I'll turn on the dictorobitary so we may converse with them.
You know, maybe we're barking up the wrong tree.
One thing a policeman learns, Mr. Trent, is patience.
-Where the burn spot you mentioned.
-Right over the - look!
We'll investigate, but move carefully.
A moment or two more, and you will be the first live Earth people ever to enter a celestial ship.
Wow...boy,  how could anything that big hide for so long a time ?
Never heard metal sound like that before.
-What do you see ?
-Only my reflection. Must be some kind of one-way glass.
-How do you get into this thing ?
-I'm not sure I want to find out.
They're just outside.
You can open the outer hatch now.
-You goin' in that thing ?
-That's what we're here for.
-I don't know, the way these things speed around we might just get in there and pft! Off it goes.
-That's a chance we take.
Well, I took a chance on those earlier airplanes. Might just as well see what the inside of one of these looks like. Got your guns ready ?
-I tell you one thing, if a little green man jumps out at me I'm shooting first and asking questions later.
They're in the outer chamber now.
Eros, do we have to kill them ?
-Yes.
-It seems such a waste.
Well wouldn't it be better to kill a few now than, with their meddling, permit them  to destroy the entire universe ?
-You're always right, Eros.
-Of course.
But those are not my words, those are the words of the Ruler.
Now you two stay right where you're at.
We will do as you command. For the moment.
-No for the moment about it. You just do as I tell you.
You do not need guns.
-Maybe we think we do.
They would be of no use to you now. 
-They've been mighty useful before on flesh and blood, and you two look like you've got a lot of both.
True, they would be effective upon us. If you were to have the opportunity to use them...
Mister, if you don't get away from that control board I'll show you just how effective they can be.
Shall we talk now, or wait ? Your friends will be here shortly.
-What friends ?
-Those you left at the vehicle.
-If you've done anything to Paula...
-Take it easy Mr. Trent.
Oh I assure you, no harm has come to her. Would you like to see?
Next time you try that I won't aim at the board.
-You're a headstrong young man.
I was only going to turn on the televisor so you could see her movements. 
Go ahead, my friend, but move very carefully. 
She's only fainted.
-You fiend !
-I ? A fiend ? ...
I am a soldier of our planet !
I ? A fiend ? We did not come here as enemies.
We came only with friendly intentions. To talk.
To ask your aid.
-Our aid ?
-Yes.
Your aid for the whole universe. But your governments of Earth refused even to accept our existence.
Even though you've seen us, heard our messages, you still refused to accept us.
Why is it so important that you want to contact the governments of our Earth ?
Because of death. Because all you of Earth are idiots !
-Now you just hold on, Buster.
-No you hold on. 
First was your firecracker, a harmless explosive. Then your handgrenade.
They began to kill your own people a few at a time. Then the bomb, then a larger bomb.
Many people are killed at one time. Then your scientists stumbled upon the atom bomb. Split the atom.
Then the hydrogen bomb, where you actually explode the air itself.
Now you [audio jump] brings the destruction of the entire universe, served by our sun.
The only explosion left is the solaronite.
-Why there's no such thing.
-Perhaps to you.
But we've known it for centuries. Your scientists will stumble upon it as they have all the others.
But the juvenile minds you possess will not comprehend its strength, until it's too late.
You're way above our heads.
The solaronite is a way to explode the actual particles of sunlight.
Why that's impossible.
Even now, your scientists are working on a way to harness the sun's rays.
The rays of sunlight are minute particles.
Is it so far from your imagination they cannot do as I have suggested? 
Why a particle of sunlight can't even be seen or measured.
Can you see or measure an atom ? Yet you can explode one.
A ray of sunlight is made up many atoms.
So what if we do developed this solaronite bomb ? We'd be even a stronger nation than now. 
Stronger. You see ? You see ? Your stupid minds...stupid ! Stupid !!
-That's all I'm taking from you !
-Get back here you jerk !
Let him finish.
It's because of men like you that all must be destroyed.
Headstrong, violent ! No use of the mind God gave you.
You talk of God ?
You also think it impossible that we, too, might think of God ?
You,  who wear the uniform of your country. You see, I wear the uniform of my country.
Yes, we've had to use drastic means to get to you, but you left us no alternative.
When you have the solaronite, you have nothing. Nor, does the universe.
You speak of solaronite, but just what is it ?
Take a can of your gasoline. Say this can of gasoline is the sun.
Now you spread a thin a line of it to a ball, representing the Earth.
Now, the gasoline represents the sunlight, the sun particles.
Here we saturate the ball with the gasoline, the sunlight.
Then we put a flame to the ball. The flame will speedily travel around the Earth, back along the line of gasoline to can, or the sun itself. It will explode this source, and spread to every place that gasoline, or sunlight, touches.
Explode the sunlight here, Gentlemen, and you explode the universe.
Explode the sunlight here, and a chain reaction will occur, direct to the sun itself.
And to all the planets that sunlight touches.
To every planet in the universe. This why you must be stopped.
This is why any means must be used to stop you.
In a friendly manner, or as it seems, you want it.
-He's mad.
-Mad ? Is it mad that you destroy other people to save yourselves ?
You have done this.
Is it mad that one country must destroy another to save themselves ?
You have also done this. How then is it mad that one planet must destroy another that threatens the very existence-
-That's enough !!
In my land, women are for advancing the race, not for fighting man's battles. Life is not so expansive on my planet.
We don't cling to it like you do. Our entire aim is for the development of our planet.
-What happened to you ?
-How come you're all alone ?
I asked for lots of help !
-You sounded drunk or something on the radio.
-If I didn't see it with my own eyes I would never have believed it !
-Believed what ?
It was horrible ! And he almost broke my shoulder !
Look, what are you trying to say ? If you don't make sense we'll never get to the bottom of this. Now who slugged you ?
Inspector Clay.
-What ?
-It was Clay all right, only not like we remembered him.
Well his grave was busted into, wasn't it ?
Next you'll tell me you saw skeletons.
-We did, earlier.
-Now I know you're off your rocker.
All of us saw, the Lieutenant, the Colonel, everybody!
-Where's the Lieutenant now ?
-We've gotta find them.
Mrs. Trent is gone! I was left here to guard her. Then Clay showed up and put me out of the running.
And the second time tonight and I'm getting darned tired of it !
-Which way were they going ?
-Oh, that way.
Come on !
Then one day it could all be gone, in one big puff of smoke and ball of fire. All that out there, the stars, the planets, all just an empty void.
You two had better come along with us.
-Come with you ? Where ?
-The police station.
So it seems you think you have the upper hand.
Look out there. 
Jeff.
She is unharmed, but he would kill in seconds if I so choose.
Holy cow!
Look there.
It's Clay all right, there's no mistaking that.
-And he's got Mrs. Trent !
-Get your gun ready.
-From all I've seen tonight guns won't do any good.
Clay is dead, and we buried him. How are we going to kill somebody that's already dead ?
Dead ! And yet there he stands ! That other one earlier I emptied a full clip into him.
I'm seeing it, that's the only reason I'm listening to you.
Look, I've got an idea. Hurt him or not, we've got to try something.
I'm going to sneak up behind him and whop him over the head. That oughta make him move.
Follow me. Even when Clay was alive he couldn't run fast enough to catch me, so when he does, you grab Mrs. Trent and run like lightning in the opposite direction.
-Oh, you think it will work ?
-Know anything else to try ?
Oh, I'll be all right. Take care of the others.
Your men have felled the big one.
This could only happen because the electrode ray is off.
He'll walk again when I turn it on.
Hold it, right there.
-Suppose the Lieutenant and the others are in that thing !
-Well suppose there are martians or something in there !
Come on, let's go.
Open up in there, open up !
-Get that door open.
-Colonel I wouldn't know one switch from another.
Hold on Eros, I'll have the ship in the air in a minute !
Get out of here, Jeff ! The ship's on fire !
Eros !
Eros everything's on fire ! Hurry, wake up Eros ! Eros, Eros, wake up, wake up !
Eros! Eros wake up, Eros! God wake up!
Oh, I wonder if that's the last we'll see of them ?
Perhaps, but sooner or later there'll be other.
Look !
Have they caught that woman, that thing yet ?
Hey that's right, there's another ghoul running loose.
And it's my guess that she'll look like him.
With the ship and the ray gun gone, they have no control.
We got to hand it to them though, they're far ahead from us.
Fire ! Eros ! Aaaaaaaaah !
My friend, you have seen this incident based on sworn testimony.
Can you prove that it didn't happen ?
Perhaps on your way home, you will pass someone in the dark, and you will never know it, for they will be from outer space.
Many scientists believe that another world is watching us this moment.
We once laughed at the horseless carriage, the aeroplane, the telephone, the electric light, vitamins, radio, and even television !
And now some of us laugh at outer space.
God help us... in the future.
Subtitles by FredFal
From her beginnings on a Navy drawing board... through the months of secret field experiments out on the Western desert... then through the desperate search for new metals with properties she needed... she was designed to be man's greatest weapon of the seas... the atom-powered submarine.
Her engines were to be a miracle of speed and power... her sides strong enough to withstand any blow... her armament and firepower of greater force... than the worst enemy she might encounter.
The mind of man had thought of everything... except that which was beyond his comprehension.
- All right, Griff, I'll take over.
- Good morning, Captain. Had breakfast?
Yep. Orange juice, bacon, eggs, coffee.
- How we doing?
- I can't get used to this thing.
Just like an automatic elevator.
Speed: 18. Steady on course.
Quite a bit of difference between this and the old-fashioned iron lung, huh?
Roomy? My gosh, this conning tower is just like a ballroom.
Take it easy, Griff.
It's still a submarine.
- Aye, aye, sir.
- How about the men?
They should complain?
All they do is eat and sleep, press a button when there's work to be done.
How about you, Captain?
Satisfied?
Down scope.
Why shouldn't I be satisfied?
Three world records in the bag on our first shakedown cruise?
Listen to that music.
All we need is some champagne and dancing girls.
Shall I have the chief change the record?
Yeah, you'd better, before we start chasing mermaids.
MacAninch, something a little more salty, if you please.
Salty, sir?
Yeah, let's get off this Hawaiian kick.
It's even demoralizing the captain.
Aye, aye, sir.
Eight.
Pair of fives.
Pair of tens.
- What's going on?
- Yeah, what?
¿Que pasa?
I dig that.
There's another beep from the sonar epuipment, sir.
Target bearing 1-8-0.
Range: 1-5-0-0.
There's nothing back there.
Sonar still picks it up,
Captain.
Bearing.
It's dead astern.
Submerged about as deep as we are.
Looks like it could be following us.
Whales sometimes get playful out here in the Pacific.
Scans bigger than a whale.
- Another sub?
- Even bigger than a sub.
It's closing in on us, Captain.
You'd better take a look at this.
Conning Tower to Control.
Left 20 degrees rudder.
New course: 3-0-0.
Left 20 degrees rudder.
New course:3-0-0.
The rudder is 20 degrees left, sir.
What would you call that?
Probably a short circuit in our sonar system showing up as an echo.
- Check it.
- I just did, Captain.
It's working all right.
Shall I check it again, sir?
Never mind.
It's really gaining on us, whatever it is.
- Getting closer, huh?
- As close as 500 yards.
Conning Tower to Maneuvering.
All ahead flank.
All ahead flank, sir.
Give those atoms a poke.
Give me everything you've got.
Aye, aye, sir.
Are we losing it?
No, sir. He just gained another 200 on us.
Give me a sonar image. I want to see what this thing looks like.
Griff, man battle stations.
Man battle stations!
Man battle stations.!
Man battle stations.!
Go to Control and take the conn.
I want a zigzag course and the usual escape pattern.
Aye, aye, sir.
Now let's see what you got here.
What do you call that?
It's no whale, sir, that's for sure.
It's no ship either.
Let me check that wiring again.
Keep me informed.
Come left 3-5-0.
Left 3-5-0.
Sonar checks okay, Captain.
Bearing: 1-2-0.
Range: 5-0-0.
Can't seem to lose it, Captain.
Range: 4-0-0.
What happens when it catches up with us?
When you're in command of $55 million worth of submarine, you don't gamble.
Range: 3-0-0.
- Stand by to take her deep.
- Aye, aye, sir.
Range: 2-0-0.
- Take her deep.
- Full dive on the bow plane.
Full dive, sir.
- Ten degrees down bubble.
- Ten degrees down bubble.
- All planes are at full dive, sir.
- Very well.
Resume course.
Steer 3-3-0.
3-3-0, sir.
It's too close to get a range now, sir.
Conning Tower to Maneuvering.
All stop.
We're getting a radiation warning signal. Where's it coming from?
Not from our reactor, sir.
It must be.
Recheck your reactor.
Reactor shield okay.
Engine's okay.
Nothing hot in here, sir.
- What happened to us?
- I don't know.
- All you men okay?
- Okay.
But let's find out where that radiation is coming from before we all fry.
It's coming from outside the ship.
Look!
- I don't figure it.
- I can't either, sir.
Haven't got time to try now.
Our sonar system's out. Fix it.
Maneuvering, let's pull out of here!
All ahead full!
All ahead full, sir.!
But we're standing still!
That's not the engine's fault, sir.
Keep pouring it on.
You okay, Griff?
Okay here, sir.
Surface!
Still no luck.
We're fouled tight.
Hand me that thing.
I want two Apua-Lung volunteers to blast the sluice.
Get in your gear and stand by the escape hatch. Take a demolition charge.
- I'll take over.
- Aye, aye, Captain.
Anybody hurt?
Mac took an awful crack in the head here, Captain.
- How do you feel?
- All right.
What's a fractured skull, anyway?
Is that damn thing still going?
Not afraid of a little radiation, are you?
I've heard it makes you so you can't have children, sir.
Mac was married just before we left port, Captain.
- Congratulations, Mac.
- Thanks. We're counting on a family.
We won't hang around down here any longer than we can help it.
Volunteers are ready, sir.
Hand me that thing.
I'm gonna rig in the bow diving plane to see if that will free us. If it won't...
Just cross your fingers.
Rig in bow diving planes.
Aye, aye, sir.
That's doing it.
Full rise on the stern planes.
Aye!
We're loose, Captain!
Speeïs increasing.
We're coming up, sir.
- That's a relief.
- Stand by to surface.
Stand by to surface.
Aye, sir.
What's on your mind?
Stern planes are fouled.
Show signs of radioactivity.
- Tell those swimmers to stay clear?
- I did, sir.
What'd you find?
A chunk of stuff caught in the stern diving plane, sir.
- What kind of stuff?
- Rubberlike, Captain.
What'd it look like?
We didn't get too close because of what the exec said about radioactivity.
- Looked like a fish to me.
- It was more like a barrel.
- A barrel?
- Yes, sir.
I believe it's stuck there till we get into dry dock.
She's jammed solid, sir.
All right, you men go below and get yourselves some coffee.
What's your guess, Griff?
I was just gonna ask you, sir.
Privately?
Privately, I'm keeping my mouth shut and I'm advising you to do the same.
The next time I cruise in these waters
I'll have armed torpedoes on board.
How about officially?
Officially?
Shakedown cruise completed, X-ray.
Struck submerged object, X-ray.
Damage minor.
Putting into Pearl for repairs.
Have it coded and passed on to Operations.
Aye, aye, sir.
And just hope that's the end of it.
And just hope that's the end of it.
But that was only the beginning.
When Commander Mathews brought the atomic submarine into Pearl Harbor... the Defense Department found itself confronted with a problem... beyond the scope of Navy manuals.
What was the nature of that nameless substance... found caught in the damaged diving planes?
A substance so strange, so inexplicable and alarming... that the best minds in the nation had to be called upon to solve the problem.
Behind the guarded door where the secret lay hidden... and for the first time in their lives... three people met.
Couldn't be a mistake.
You think so, Professor?
It's tissue, all right.
- Where'd it come from?
- Some living creature.
All that hunk came from one living creature?
That's right.
You mean, that's not all one animal?
There's more to it?
A great deal more.
It'd be dead now, wouldn't it?
I doubt it.
Must be pretty big.
Enormous.
Doctor, what kind of a sea beast would be that large?
What do you call it so I can stop calling it "it"?
I have no idea.
Nor have I.
Well, how do we find out?
That will take time and research.
I'll wire the university right away to get a leave of absence.
The Navy will take care of that.
How about you, Professor?
Working with Dr. Carter is every marine biologist's dream... but my school needs me.
You can get along without me,
I'm sure.
Can we, Doctor?
No.
Forgive my ignorance, Doctor, but what makes her so unipue?
ProfessorJoyce is head of Marine Biology... at the Southeastern Institute of Oceanography.
I'd say she's probably the outstanding authority on marine biology... with the possible exception of Vanderhume himself.
Then we'll get him.
Before you start looking,
I may as well tell you...
Vanderhume is dead.
Oh.
ProfessorJoyce.
Yes?
I have to ask you to stick around.
Why, Commander?
Because the... the Navy would appreciate it.
I'm sure the Navy's able to get along without me.
Dr. Carter seems to think otherwise.
Dr. Carter's perfectly able to speak for himself.
I'm speaking for him.
I'm expected at a board of regents meeting on Tuesday.
It's about the appropriations for our coming academic year.
Are those appropriations that important?
To my school, very much so.
You know, this thing that may be running loose in the Pacific... that could be important too.
- I'm sure of it.
- Perhaps not in the way you think.
I'm a scientist, Commander.
I don't have to be reminded that your objectives are not necessarily my own.
Our objectives have nothing to do with the situation.
The Navy will see you're not penalized for your absence from the institute.
Arrangements will be made.
Well, I feel like I'm being drafted.
You are.
It was still too early for the world to know what was going on... behind that closed door.
Only a handful of men in high places heard reports of progress made... and waited impatiently for the final conclusion.
Mathews speaking.
Oh, yes, Admiral.
Hold on a minute, sir.
They're still making tests, sir.
There's nothing conclusive to tell you.
I'll call you the minute anything happens.
Yes, sir.
Good night, sir.
During 12 days and nights nothing was certain.
You people work hard.
- It's our job.
- I didn't realize how hard.
- Are you trying to apologize?
- In a way.
- It's not necessary.
- I think it is.
Let me explain something to you.
A, I have been privileged to classify an unknown sea specimen.
B, I have the honor of working with the greatJohn Carter of Harvard... the inventor of analytical biology.
And C, my mind just isn't attuned to discuss things on your level, Commander.
I don't think you're being entirely fair, Miss Joyce.
Look, I have been working for almost two weeks now... without a decent night's sleep.
I'm tired!
I read your book on marine biology... and your plankton theory in tracing surface currents.
Strictly in the line of duty, of course.
I'm sorry, Commander.
Well, I'll forgive you if you call me Pete.
All right, Pete. But you have to let me get back to my work.
Why don't you take a break.
I have a reason.
- The Navy always has a reason.
- That's right.
All right, maybe you're right.
Tell me.
He's a pretty nice guy, isn't he?
He's wonderful.
- You're pretty fond of him, aren't you?
- Fond?
Why, he's magnificent.
He's a brilliant scientist.
His technipues are creative.
What are you driving at?
Oh, I just thought
I'd clear the atmosphere.
Oh. You mean romance.
Now you tell me something,
Commander.
Pete.
All right. Pete.
When you're driving that atomic submarine of yours... do you have much time for romance?
Even if I did admit I had the time, where would I find the opportunity?
Women aren't allowed aboard a submarine.
Poor boy.
I thought the Navy was epuipped for every emergency.
For the record, are you tied up?
I see what you mean.
Does that mean you're not?
A girl has to have some secrets, doesn't she?
Do you have the results of the iodide solution?
What?
What's the matter, Leslie?
Don't you feel well?
Well, I don't know.
I guess it's just lack of sleep.
You'd better get some rest.
I'll be all right.
Here are your results.
On the evening of the 13th day...
Dr. LeslieJoyce was taking the results ofher last test.
John, I think you'd better take a look at this.
What's going on?
- There's no doubt about it now.
- No doubt about what?
Thanks to ProfessorJoyce, we've discovered the nature of your monster.
What a gal.
Naval Intelligence.
Admiral Burns, please.
Well, Admiral, it's happened.
Carter and Joyce have got news for you.
Yes, sir.
Very well, sir.
I'll tell them.
An assistant secretary of the Navy,
Mr. Robert David Chase... is coming out here.
Adm. Norman, commander-in-chief of the entire Pacific area, wants in on it too.
He'll see us first thing in the morning.
Here, gentlemen, is your villain.
It'd take an enormous number of those to disable a Navy submarine.
Or just one of enormous size,
Mr. Chase.
There's a spuid on exhibit in the
American Muzeum of Natural History... just under 100 feet in length.
It came from the waters off the coast of Maine.
Our navy has never encountered one of those marine monsters before.
- How do you account for that?
- They only live at extreme depths.
They almost never come up unless they're disturbed.
Disturbed? By what?
Hydrogen bombs.
H-bombs have been blamed for every freak accident that's happened... since, up to and including marine monsters being disturbed.
Not disturbed, Mr. Chase.
Hungry.
Six days ago we gave this fellow here a radioactive meal.
Not a fatal dose, however.
Now, here is what he likes best... his regular diet of small fish.
Now watch.
Ordinarily cephalopods are not timid about catching a good meal.
This fellow seems to be having difficulty, however.
Why? We checked our answer with Professor Imoto in Tokyo.
He concurs.
Some species of fish seem to be gifted with their own natural geiger counter.
So the giant fish's dinner knows when it's coming and swims away?
In that case, he'd starve to death very puickly.
Unless he finds some other creature to live on.
What creature, for instance?
Some higher form of life.
Animals, possibly.
Or even man.
Gentlemen, let's put together a hypothesis from what we know.
In this area lie the Marshall Islands... where the H-bomb experiments took place.
Wind and north epuatorial current account for a drift of radioactivity... in this direction... contaminating marine life on the way.
Here lies the great Mindanao Deep... a chasm in the floor of the ocean so vast it has never been explored.
This is where our monster must have lived until recently... when he became radioactive... and began to warn his natural prey out of the surrounding waters.
He had to find other food or die.
Forced to rise to the surface... he hunted along theJapanese current.
There is evidence that he was swept in this direction.
What evidence?
Well, you may have read it yourself in the papers.
A month ago part of a Japanese fishing fleet disappeared in these waters... without a trace.
Siberian seal fishing has been reported unaccountably bad.
But theJapanese fishermen may have gone down in a typhoon.
Who knows what's really happening in Siberia?
Cmdr. Mathews' submarine encountered it.
Or are you puestioning that as well?
I have to puestion all of it.
Perhaps ProfessorJoyce has another opinion to advance.
No, I'm afraid not.
We've had too little sleep in the last few days.
- If you want to discuss anything else...
- That won't be necessary. Thank you.
You've given us enough to think of.
Before you go, do you mind giving us your reaction to our findings?
That'll be taken under advisement.
It's been very enlightening.
- Thank you for all you've done.
- Good night.
Good night, sir.
- Well, that's letting us down easy.
- Oh, you're just tired.
So what?
So I'm tired.
They didn't even believe us.
Well, they have to be cautious.
Of course.
We understand.
Does that mean we're free to go now?
Just as soon as your release comes through, in just a few days.
John, you can make the science congress.
If you play your cards right,
I can meet you in Cairo.
I was never very much good at playing cards.
- I'm tired. I'm going to the hotel now.
- We can all go over together.
All right.
I'll just change.
She's a wonderful girl.
Sure is.
- And you are a lucky man.
- Lucky?
Don't we make our own luck,
Commander?
Well, it isn't everyone that can vacation in Egypt.
Vacation?
No, Leslie and I have published contrary viewpoints... on the sinking nature of the coast of the Red Sea.
We're going to investigate via Apua-Lung.
The loser is going to publish a retraction.
Sounds ideal.
Nothing like mixing pleasure with work, huh?
Work?
Oh, yes, that is your work, isn't it?
Well, I'm ready.
Fine.
Well, good night.
He's an interesting man.
Isn't he?
Stand by to abandon ship!
4-0 minutes, 13 seconds west.
I'm repeating our position.
Nice of him to throw this going-away party for us.
Probably comes off of his expense account.
You sound bitter.
Well, if he's giving us a going-away party, why isn't he here?
Probably at a meeting of some kind.
What's the trouble, Leslie?
Oh, I don't know.
Just let-down, nervous.
As nervous as a bride left waiting at the altar.
- Don't be a fool.
- On the contrary.
I've been a sober professor so long, I'm entitled to one night of foolishness.
May I have this dance?
Do you consider that part of your foolishness?
Good evening.
I have your transportation passes and releases signed, sealed and delivered.
You'll be leaving in the morning.
Believe me, in the Navy that takes some doing.
- Thanks, Pete. You've been swell.
- He's probably glad to get rid of us.
I'm glad you didn't wait.
I'll have the same.
If the waiter comes by, would you order me a T-bone, rare, and some red wine?
- Where are you going?
- We, my dear doctor, are going to dance.
- With your permission, sir.
- Live it up, children.
- But you haven't even asked me.
- That's the way we do it in the Navy.
- But I haven't even had my dinner.
- Would you order another T-bone?
I don't like T-bones.
You're being a fool.
Don't believe her.
She says that to all the boys.
You're both being fools. Just because you're men, you think that...
Do you like lobster?
- Yes.
- Broiled with garlic butter and parsley.
Yes.
- Got it?
- Got it.
It's so balmy here.
Is it always like this?
Yes.
Don't you miss the rain?
No.
I like the winter... and the snow.
Snow's cold.
I'm taking an awful chance.
What do you mean?
You're going to accuse me of being a man.
Oh, my, I haven't eaten that well in years.
I guess your appetite kind of depends on your state of mind. Don't you think?
I've been thinking about a lot of things.
- About your trip tomorrow, for instance.
- Isn't it wonderful?
You're still leaving?
Of course she's leaving.
Why shouldn't she?
- I thought...
- I'm sorry.
What's going on here?
It was just something I said, and Pete misunderstood.
I am sorry, Pete.
Do you mind if I make a mental comment upon the nature of women?
Excuse me.
Pete, please, I...
Well, hello.
What am I gonna do?
Perhaps I could help you if you'd brief me on the background.
He kissed me.
Did you enjoy it?
Yes.
That seems like a normal reaction.
- He didn't even ask me.
- That's hardly relevant.
But I don't know him... who he is, what he's like.
Doesn't seem to have the same reservations about you.
In any case, tomorrow we'll be on a plane... and I'm puite convinced that, clinically speaking... no irreparable damage has been done.
- You know Prof. Joyce and Dr. Carter.
- Of course I do. Please be seated.
Thank you.
Admiral Norman's compliments.
And will you please come to his office first thing in the morning?
He asked me to apologize for rescinding your release.
Rescinding it?
A tramp steamer Honolulu-bound from Vancouver has been lost at sea.
It's considered possible that there may be some connection... between this incident and our problem.
We'll know more definitely if we find any survivors.
The area is being searched now.
Life raft. Men in it.
I'll set her down and bring them in.
Over and out.
Tell Admiral Norman the Polar Empress survivors are checking in.
You boys had a rough time, from what I hear.
Take a deep breath.
I have to check you over.
What happened?
It grabbed us, that's all.
What do you mean, it grabbed you?
Something came up out of the water, grabbed our ship and pulled it under.
Another breath.
You kidding me?
Why would I be kidding you?
Something came up out of the water.
Something like what, for instance?
Something like...
Well, like those.
Only big.
The biggest you ever saw.
Ain't I right?
They'll tell you.
And another one came up at us and grabbed the ship.
And another one... a whole lot of them... and they dragged it under.
Just like I told you.
I keep seeing those things coming up at us.
Been drinking?
What do you find to drink on a life raft outside of water?
- A blow on the head, anything like that?
- I'm all right!
Don't you believe me about... about those?
Of course I believe you about those.
Why shouldn't I?
I want you to go along with this fellow.
He's going to take you down the hall.
There's a man there with a white smock just like mine.
I want you to tell him all about... those.
See that he gets to Doc.
All right, you're next.
How about you?
Having any trouble with things like this?
Who's this Doc character?
He's one of the staff.
I ain't seen anything like that.
You can tell Doc for us we ain't seen nothin'.
I know he's lying as well as you do, but I have to account to Washington.
Am I justified spending half a million dollars searching the Pacific... on the strength of these lies?
Burns speaking.
Thank you.
That's the infirmary.
Doc says the patient's as bad as any of these boys.
He's recanted his original story, and now he won't say anything else.
Can he be released?
I think it's my turn now.
Tell them to let him go.
But not till after I get there.
Send in Hall, please.
- And don't come back unless I call you.
- Yes, ma'am.
Got a match?
Yeah, sure.
Let me light it for you.
- Care for one yourself?
- Sure would.
Maybe you can tell me where I can find Doc.
Doc?
He's through there, down the hall.
- What do you want him for?
- Well, that's kind of personal.
Besides, I don't think you'd believe me even if I told you.
I'd believe anything you told me.
Sit down.
Over here.
Well, it's kind of funny, but...
I saw the strangest thing.
- All I can say is, stay away from Doc.
- Why?
He'll make out you're sick in the head.
That's ridiculous.
Why should he do that?
No kidding.
That's what he thinks I am.
Have you been seeing things?
Me? Seeing things?
Don't be silly.
Well, sort of.
Tell me what.
I'm not telling nobody. You want me to get bounced back to Doc again?
What sort of things did you see?
I asked you first.
Okay. But if you say I said this,
I'll say I didn't.
You won't believe this... but something happened to a ship I was on.
She went down with all hands, except me and a few others.
I saw it happen myself.
Know what did it?
It was a giant octopus.
Well?
I guess it's up to you now, Admiral.
Take whatever steps are necessary.
In the weeks which followed, the North
Pacific was closed to all shipping.
The sea trade between three continents came to a standstill.
No nation in the world failed to demand, through its government and press... the reason for such drastic steps.
It was officially announced that the US
Navy was engaged in secret maneuvers... while in reality... the strangest search in history was taking place.
- Any news from the fleet?
- So far they've found nothing, sir.
That's from the State Department, sir, and they want an immediate reply.
Let's say we do find your beast.
What will you do to it then? That's the next point for us to consider.
Torpedoes if it's on the surface.
Depth charges if it's below.
- If you miss your first shot?
- We'll get it with the second.
It may not wait for you.
The Navy is not entirely incapable of speed, ProfessorJoyce. We'll chase it.
I think you underestimate him,
Admiral.
The body of a large cephalopod is like a giant sack... which he can fill with sea water and empty suddenly when he's alarmed.
Let me show you, Admiral.
Now watch.
Even the best of your ships are comparatively old-fashioned... compared to the cephalopod.
He's jet-propelled.
We'll have to destroy him with the first shot.
The State Department wants to know how soon we plan to raise our blockade.
Australia, Canada and Peru are protesting to the UN... unless we do it at once.
Why don't we tell them the whole story?
Washington makes those decisions, not us.
This stays top secret until the thing is definitely sighted... and confined to a limited area.
- How much longer will that take?
- It shoulïve happened by now.
When you start a job like this again, where do you begin?
With Naval Intelligence,
I should think.
If you mean me, I'm afraid I can't give you a very hopeful send-off.
My department has sifted all the information made available to us... during the last ten days... and this is what it boils down to.
One: three bathers missing from Australian beaches.
Sharks, probably.
Anything else?
Unusually high waves breaking on Midway.
Possible marine disturbance.
That's worthwhile investigating.
It is being at this time.
I'll have the reports within three hours.
Marine weather station off the Canadian coast is out of radio contact with land.
Anything more?
Deep-sea fishermen along the northwestern US coast... are complaining because of the poor fishing there.
That's all.
Any one of these may well be the clue we're seeking.
I suggest we take the one most likely... the weather ship out of touch with land.
Can you fly me there?
Admiral Burns will have a flight ready for you and accompany you.
- Thank you.
- Yes, sir.
Good luck.
May I take the next most likely... the unlucky fishermen in the Northwest?
- Is that even worth considering?
- I think so.
I can be ready in ten minutes if you'll have a plane for me.
- I'll see to it.
- Thank you.
Sir, my exec is aboard the submarine.
He's perfectly capable of relieving me.
I can't spare you to go hunting needles in a haystack... particularly a haystack
3,000 miles in expanse.
You'll have to stand by, Mathews.
That haystack may be a lot smaller than we thought, Mathews.
- Be on the flight deck in 20 minutes.
- Yes, sir.
Well, there she is.
How'd the car get turned over?
Well, the way we see it, they must have parked the car up the beach a bit... there where it's steep.
Brakes worked loose... rolled down, hit this soft sand... and over she went.
The ignition's still turned on.
Don't that beat it all.
Nobody ever noticed that.
Any reports since then of whales or sea serpents?
You mean she wasn't kidding?
She wasn't kidding.
What would you say made those marks, Officer?
Why, the beach was covered with those marks a couple days ago.
Commander Mathews to Sheriff's Station. Over.
Sheriffs Station.
Go ahead, Commander. Over.
Relay this message to the 12th Naval District.
Have them notify
Dr. John Carter...
You got that? Carter... that he's wanted here at once.
This has top priority.
Over and out.
- Where are they?
- Oh, fishing.
Seems they can't get enough fishing, them two.
- How's their luck?
- Not good at all.
Say, you mean to tell me the Navy sent you down here in a jet... just so you could go fishing?
That's about it.
- Hadn't you better tell them I'm here?
- Yeah, sure.
Oh, by the way, where's that imprint you were telling me about?
Down there behind those rocks.
- Thanks.
- Yeah, sure.
Hey, folks!
It's John.
I'd better get my robe.
Any sign of that whale?
- Still kidding, huh, Commander?
- This is no kidding.
Yeah, I know.
Flying saucers?
No, something that came from the sea.
Please be careful.
Look, Dr. Joyce, don't give me that sea serpent business, huh?
Just be careful and keep a sharp lookout. Understand?
Yeah.
Sea serpent.
Saves a lot of argument.
Well, Doctor?
As Leslie probably told you... it's the imprint of a giant octopoda bidranchiata.
Did you get photographs?
Yes. I sent them to Admiral Norman.
I hope he can believe his eyes.
Something convinced him. He's setting up headpuarters in San Francisco right now.
Deputy tells me fishing is rather poor here.
- Haven't had a single bite in 12 hours.
- Every sign is positive.
It definitely has been here, and it probably hasn't gone away.
Maybe you can convince her she oughta beat it and let the Navy have this job.
Beat it?
What does she say?
What's the difference?
Look, Pete, you don't see many women in the seagoing Navy.
- Are you kidding?
- Oh, shoreside women, sure.
But there's a whole new breed that feel they're as smart and courageous as men.
And they are.
They don't like to be overprotected or have their initiative taken away.
A, you want me to miss an opportunity to see a specimen we may never see again.
B, you're making up my mind for me.
And C, I not only don't like being pushed around... but you underestimate my ability to help in a crisis.
My sympathies are entirely on her side.
Didn't take long to lose that argument.
News of that incident on the Oregon coast reached throughout the world.
By order of the Defense Department... shipping took refuge in the harbors and all beach areas were closed.
The coastal waters of the Pacific were mined.
From Panama to the Arctic Circle... the Western coast of America made ready.
I've been asked what the Navy is doing in this emergency.
Inasmuch as operational headpuarters are now set up here in San Francisco... we will use this area as an example.
Offshore minefields, together with radar and sonar warning devices... set up on Golden Gate Bridge... should be more than adepuate to keep the monster out of the Bay Area.
A submarine net has been hung from Golden Gate Bridge itself... completely blocking the only entrance from the sea.
Now, this is primarily a warning device... but it's also capable of taking a charge of thousands of volts of electricity... which we've been advised will repel any form of marine life, if not kill it.
Is there anything
I haven't touched on?
You say the monster could attack us in coastal waters... and that it's dangerous to human life.
What's being done to attack it?
ProfessorJoyce will tell you.
Our first problem, of course, is to locate the monster again.
We're trying to do that now.
Operations toJohn Carter.
Have you seen anything yet?
Over.
Nothing.
It's slow out here.
Over.
Prof. Carter, this is Lt. Adams.
Where are you? Over.
Patrolling coastal waters.
Over.
What if you don't find anything?
Over.
We'll find something. We've baited the surface out here with dead shark.
The beast will come up to eat.
We've got several hundred planes watching for it in relay.
We'll find it, all right.
Over.
What'll you do when that happens?
Bomb it from the air? Over.
No, we've decided not to.
We have reason to think its destruction must be complete and instantaneous.
We risk complete failure with a near miss, or if we merely wound it.
The monster has only one vulnerable spot, one fatal target... its brain.
We're going to try to take advantage of that in a certain way.
Put ProfessorJoyce back on.
Over.
Go ahead, John Carter.
Over.
Leslie, take the newsmen down to the San Francisco Navy Yard... and show them the weapon.
That's all for now.
Stand by, Operations. Over and out.
Looks like any other torpedo, doesn't it? But it's not.
This has no propeller.
It's jet-propelled.
The Navy doesn't know what to make of it.
Perhaps you'll explain where you got the idea.
I spent all day yesterday at the Seamen's Institute... talking to retired whaling men.
This is the result.
A warhead patterned after a harpoon is encased in the nose.
Instead of exploding on contact, it's designed to penetrate... and remain fixed in the monster's flesh.
By means of spreading barbs.
And what's going to destroy the thing?
The explosive is sufficient to do that.
The difference is that in this case... we set it off electronically... once we're certain it's dead on its target.
Attention on deck!
Another thing: The men want to know if they can go on liberty.
I know Market Street looks bright from here, but we're standing by for orders.
Nobody leaves the yard.
Carry on!
Attention on deck!
I see they picked an atom sub to fight this thing.
Why is that, Commander?
Could be because of her new electronic epuipment or her speed.
- Was she ordered from Hawaii for that?
- That's right.
You think it's as bad as that?
- I think we're lucky she's here.
- Very lucky.
We have records of a monster like this one that appeared in the 13th century.
It ravaged the coastal towns of Denmark and Holland.
But they didn't have our modern weapons.
It was in those waters for over 30 years.
Here's another piece of evidence.
A monster was disturbed by volcanic eruptions on the floor of the ocean.
It happened in the same year as the Vesuvius disasters.
Gentlemen, that's all we have to tell you.
We're certainly obliged.
Thank you, Commander.
We gave you a break, now you give us one.
It all depends on you how the public takes this news.
We want them to have all the facts... but we don't want a panic on our hands.
Any last puestions?
Just one. Where did you say the monster came from?
From the Mindanao Deep, in the Pacific.
- Are there any more from down there?
- Probably.
- How many?
- I don't know.
- What do we do about them?
- I don't know that, either.
If you don't, then who does?
Thank you.
I was just wondering, that's all.
The 12th Naval District alerted the entire San Francisco area.
They were waiting and watching for some sign... of the approach of the monster.
Electric minefield. Contact.
Operations wants a check. Radar.
Sonar.
Radar. Sonar.
Still blank.
Let's get a cup of coffee.
Come on.

Coming on through.
That's the end of our first line of defense.
- Send a red alert.
- Right.
Red alert for Operation Sea Beast.
Get traffic off the Golden Gate Bridge.
This is Billings, and there's contact.
Contact with our net.
Give me instructions.
Over to you, Operations.
All right, Billings.
Let's see what the high voltage can do.
Close your switch.
GetJohn Carter for me, please.
It's not going to be me, after all.
I might as well be at the bridge.
Go ahead.
Wait a minute.
I'm going to go with you.
Hello, John.
It struck.
- Where?
- Golden Gate Bridge.
I thought we had this figured out.
What happened?
I can't tell you.
Instead of being driven off, it attacked.
Maybe it wants to fight.
Operations to all Navy personnel on the Golden Gate Bridge.
You can do nothing more there.
You're to abandon your posts and not sacrifice your lives needlessly.
- These are Captain Stacey's orders.
- Aye, aye, sir!
What's going on out there?
I threw the voltage into her, and up she came.
- Is it still on?
- Yes, sir.
- Where are you going?
- On the bridge.
- What for?
- To pull the switch.
No, you're not.
Do you wanna get killed?
Everyone has to be cleared by Captain Stacey, Carter orJoyce.
All right, clear me.
I'm Carter.
- Okay.
- Okay, Chief.
Hold onto her!
John, this way!
And a good evening, friends.
This is Sam Hayes.
I've got news for you.
As you probably know, our city has suffered disaster.
A marine monster is at large, perhaps even inside the Bay Area.
The federal authorities are doing everything to locate it... and, together with the city government, are taking every step proper... and possible to end this danger.
You are advised by the officials in charge... to remain in your homes.
This beast is dangerously radioactive.
Do not cause confusion.
Go about your ordinary pursuits.
Police officers will advise you if you must move to another place.
It will take some time before the road congestion along the peninsula... can be cleared.
Do not take these roads.
The Oakland Bay Bridge also is blocked, according to incoming reports.
The ferry boats are not running, so stay away from the Ferry Building.
I repeat, the ferry boats are not running.
This would put it approximately here.
Have they cleared that area?
- Not yet.
- They must.
They have a tentative position for it... in the bay near the Ferry Building.
This confirms it.
We want total and immediate evacuation... of the Embarcadero and Ferry Building area... by the order of the commandant,
12th Naval District.
Get those cars out of the foot of Market Street. Everybody back.
Go west on Market Street.
This area is in danger.
Everybody leave.
This area is in danger.
Everybody leave.
Look out!
My submarine is ready at Hunter's Point.
I have the authority to order a submarine captain.
Go ahead. You're commissioned to take any steps that seem proper.
- Aye, aye, sir. Coming, John?
- Absolutely.
We'll get in touch with you as soon as we get aboard.
Alert the Alameda area.
Station the maneuver at once.
On the double, Griff.
Take in two. Take in three.
Take in the brow.
I believe it's lifting itself out of the water.
What do we do about that?
Get me Leslie.
Com 12, this is Sea Beast. Over.
This is Com 12. Over.
Leslie, I would like to find something that would drive it back underwater.
How about heat? Over.
- I don't know. We can try.
- Hold it.
Ask Captain Stacey to contact the Army for flamethrowers. Over.
He's doing it.
Tubes forward. Stand by.
Tubes ready forward, sir.
How can you torpedo it from here with all those ships in the way?
This is a submarine. If it can go underwater, it can go under ships.
This is a deep channel.
Run below if you don't want to get wet.
We'll dive. Try to get in close enough for a clear shot.
When the sonar picks up the beast, let me know immediately.
This should do it, sir.
We're clear to shipping now.
- Range?
- All back full.
- All back full!
- Stand by, forward torpedo room.
- Stand by, forward torpedo room.
- All stop.
- All stop!
All stop, sir.
We're in too close for my taste, but it can't be helped.
We'll just have to fire our torpedo, run for it... and explode it after we're out of range.
We'll let those flamethrowers have a whack at it first.
We need a better target.
That's it.
Number one torpedo, fire!
Fire!
We're caught fast, sir.
- This is where we came in.
- What do we do now?
We explode our torpedo and get blown apart ourselves... or we think faster than we've ever thought before.
I want a man to stand by the escape hatch.
Break out an Apua-Lung and some of that plastic explosive we were issued.
I nominate myself, if you're calling for volunteers.
This is a personal matter, Griff.
I'm reserving that pleasure for myself.
Maneuvering, are we still backing full?
We're giving you all she's got.
Very well.
As second in command, it's my turn to try.
No, it's mine. You don't know where the monster's vulnerable. I do.
You want to argue about it, or you want to get free right away?
And don't waste time.
I'll need some explosive and a harpoon gun.
Hanson, diving suit and harpoon gun, on the double.
Aye, aye, sir.
Fuse. Timer to set for as long as you need.
Thank you very much.
Whatever he did, he knew his stuff.
It worked.
When the range opens up, set off the torpedo.
But the captain's still out there, and that other fellow too.
I know it. I'm obeying the captain's last orders.
You'll do as much for mine.
Range: 1-0-0-0.
Fire!
No trace of'em.
Yes, there is!
There they are.
Get 'em in sight.
Left full rudder.
Starboard ahead two-thirds.
The Army and the Navy and our gallant police and fire departments... these have all received the honors they deserve from a grateful city.
But there are three others who served San Francisco... who also must not be forgotten.
And, therefore, a memorial plaque today... has been presented to those unsung heroes: the Civilian Defense volunteers... the crossing guards... and street railway employees of this city.
Well, I guess that's it.
The sub's been ordered on patrol.
I'll be on sea duty for a few months.
I'll be seeing you, John.
- Soon, I hope.
- Will I be seeing you, Leslie?
You mean when I get back from Cairo?
I mean, women can change, move away, get married... have families.
Well, there is that possibility, but...
A, there isn't time for that to happen to me...
B, I can be reached at the school, and...
C, how would you like to collaborate with me on a book...
How To Catch a Sea Beast?
Doctor, you were right about this new breed of woman.
Eric.
Wayne.
It was good of you to come, busy as you are.
Never too busy for an interesting case... especially one ofyours.
Thanks.
Appreciate your interest.
On the phone you said... you were having a serious problem with a young girl.
Yeah- Nurse here, as a matter of fact-.
- Pretty?
- Here's her case history.
- Jane Marvin.
- Yeah, that's the name she's using.
- Very competent girl.
- And pretty.
It happened when she volunteered... to help me in my research in narco-hypnosis techniques.
- When do I get to see her?
- Right now if you want.
- Fine.
- jane, would you come in, please?
Yes, sir,.
She always appeared perfectly normal.
Pure accident that I discovered this strange thing about her.
Yes, Doctor?
Jane, I'd like you to meet Dr- Lorimer.
He and I were halfthe football backfield at med school. I did the blocking.
- How do you do, sir?
- Very happy to know you,jane.
I wanted Dr. Lorimer to be present at our research experiment today.
- That is, if you have no objection.
- No. Why should I?
Fine.
Excuse me.
WelLJane, here we go again.
Okay.
Got a nice sharp one for you this time.
Now,jane, start counting backwards-
From 20. I know.
That's right.
I've never known a subject under Pentothol to lie.
- Nor have I.
- Why the lie detector?
You'll see later.
What is your name?
Joyce...
Hatten.
Joyce Hatten
Webster.
Then you are married?
I was.
I was Mrs. Paul Webster.
- That is-
- Yes?
I'm not sure... whetherl am married...
or ever reallym. was married.
I'm not sure.
I'm just not sure.
Would you tell us about itjoyce?
Everything about it.
Everything?
That's rightjoyce.
From the beginning.
I met Paul overseas.
He was a lieutenant.
I was nursing in a hospital.
We made plans to be married... after we were both discharged.
Oh! Ho-ho!
Very well done, steward.
- Isn't he an expert, Paul?
- Well, he gets lots of practice.
After all, we aren't the first newlyweds... on this train,
Mrs. Webster.
Call me that again.
- Mrs. Webster.
- Mmm, that sounds so wonderful.
You know,
I was beginning to doubt... whether I was ever going to get to hear that-.
Youjust try and get away now.
Will there be anything else, sir?
Oh, no. No, thanks.
Thank you very much.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you.
- Good night, sir.
- Good night.
Paul...
I love you so much.
Why did we have to wait so long?
Well, I, uh...
I wrote you after I cracked up my plane-.
And scared me halfout of my wits.
You wouldn't believe what that hospital doctor told me when I called.
Well, what do you mean?
Well, according to him, you were more dead than alive.
Almost every bone broken.
Completely torn, mangled, smashed.
And you don't think it was true?
Well, now, how could I?
Look at you.
You haven't got a mark.
You haven't got a scar.
You're much more handsome than ever.
Do you know that nobody would believe... you were even in a plane crash?
But it was true, thoughJoyce.
By all rights,
I should be dead.
You don't mean that.
Lookjoyce, you have a right to know. I...
I should have told you before we were married.
- Told me what?
- How it was really.
Why I made us wait so long-.
You see, honey-
- Who is it?
- It'; me again.
- I have some more wires.
- And nobody was supposed to know... we were even on this train.
Come in.
Here you are, miss.
- Thank you. Here, you open these.
- All righty.
You folks certainly must be popular.
Especially with the telegraph company.
- Oh.
- Is something wrong?
Well, it's from the girls... at the hospital where I worked.
You know, there's such a thing as being too well-informed.
- May I?
- You may not.
Those devils.
Oh, very nice-
An old buddy of mine-.
I didn't know we had so many friends.
Yeah, me, either.
Oh, that's nice.
Ohh.
That's funny.
When's the next stop?
Well, let's see.
Yeah, 33 minutes.
No, it's 35 minutes.
- We're two minutes behind time.
- Not until then?
Actually, there's a mail pickup stop just up ahead. That's why we're slowing down.
- But is there a phone?
- Yes. We only stop for a halfa minute.
No time for anyone to leave the train.
Just so there's a phone.
Paul, what's wrong?
Please, honey, tell me what's so important.
Paul,
I don't understand.
Please explain.
Paul.
Paul, hurry!
Paul!
Paul, hurry!
[Bell Rings J
Hurry. WW'- !
We're moving.
What?
Conductor, you've got to stop the train.
It was supposed to be... the happiest moment of my life- my wedding.
And I'd just seen my husband's face for the last time.
What did you do then,
Joyce?
I was frantic.
I got off at the next stop.
I went back to that platform... but there was no sign of Paul.
Nothing.
No one had placed a call.
No one had seen him.
He'djust vanished.
And then what happened?
You wouldn't believe it was possible... would you?
A man you thought you knew so well... had married, even... could just disappear...
completely
Even after talking to all the people who knew him.
Finding nothing at his last address.
I told the police”.
hired private detectives”. checked with the army.
The only address they had was an apartment hotel.
What about where he was born?
His family?
The army records said Georgia.
Paul had never mentioned his family.
I never thought to ask him.
I loved him.
That's all that seemed to matter.
StilLyou did find something.
Months later.
Going through
Paul's things... as I had a hundred times.
- His fraternity pin.
- And how did that help?
Ichecked with the headquarters.
Wrote them.
They told me that Paul had belonged to their chapter... at Louisiana State University.
So... I went there.
They let me look at the records.
I found an address
Paul had given them... when he enrolled in college.
And where was that?
Bayou Landing- a whistle-stop in the middle...
of the Louisiana swamp country
I was the only passenger to get off
Strangely, there wasnT anothersoul to be seen.
The only evidence oflife was a deserted day coach on the siding...
looking as alone and out of place as I felt.
Well, I'll be.
Somebody meeting you here, sweetheart?
No. I thought- that is, I hoped somebody would come to pick up this.
Well, that's me-
You just didn't get off.
You must have had some good reason.
Do you know a place-
I think it's a plantation-
Called The Cypresses?
Uh-huh.
Would it be too much trouble to take me there?
I'll gladly payyou.
They don't never have no visitors.
- Was they expecting you?
- No, not exactly... but they will know who I am.
Well, for you, sweetheart,
I'll take a chance.
Go ahead. just climb in-.
Go on. Climb in-.
Bet you never seen nothing like that before.
You ever been in the bayou country before?
It's so wild, so primitive.
Yeah, and deadly.
You know how long you'd last... if you got 'I O0 yards off of this road?
Maybe 'I O minutes- lfthe Quicksand didn't get you-... the moccasins would.
And then... then there's always the gators.
Dirty, nasty, slimy gators!
Why did you have to do that?
It wasn't doing you any harm.
No? Well, how do you suppose I got this?
Anyway, baby, we didn't do him no harm.
- Yes, miss?
- I beg your pardon.
I just arrived on the train.
- The train was hours ago.
- I know.
- Were you expected? - I did write, but my letter came back unopened.
- Sol decided-
- What is it, Toby?
This young person, shejust arrived-
Have her come in.
Come in.
Yes, what is it?
This is your place?
Of course.
Well, maybe you can help me.
You see, for a long time...
I've been looking for my husband.
He disappeared the night we were married.
I've searched everywhere.
I've tried everything... and this is my last hope-.
But why should you come here?
At the university
I checked the records.
And at one time, he gave this as his address.
- The Cypresses.
- What is your name, my dear?
Mrs. Paul Webster.
And you say that your husband... this Paul Webster, gave this as his address?
According to the records.
Whoever you are, I don't know what your game is-.- ... coming here, making up fantastic stories.
It's the truth. I can prove it.
You can ask anyone-
Why should I ask anyone or care one way or the other?
Ofwhat possible interest... could your sordid little lie be to me?
I was hoping your name was Webster.
I am
Mrs. Henry Hawthorne.
- And your husband?
- I'm a widow.
I'm sorry to bother you,
Mrs- Hawthorne.- .
But I had to know.
Perhaps you are telling the truth.
It really doesn't matter.
However, I must ask you to leave at once.
Toby, get ahold of Manon.
Have him drive her back to the station.
- But, ma'am-
- What is it, Toby?
There won't be a train till tomorrow.
Oh, you're right, of course.
May we offer you the hospitality-.
Of The Cypresses for the night?
I don't seem to have any choice, do I?
Luann.
Yes, ma'am.
Show Mrs.-
What was your name again?
Mrs. Paul Webster.
Show Mrs. Webster to the guest room.
Yes, ma'am.
Anything you need to be comfortable... just ask Luann.
Thank you.
One minute,
Mrs. Webster.
While you're our guest for the night only...
I must insist on one thing.
- Yes?
- Under no circumstances... will you leave your room.
As I said before...
I don't seem to have any choice, do I?
There was something sinister about The Cypressesi.
As night darkened the house, all the doubts and fears...
which had haunted the long, lone/y miles...
of my search returned'
What secret was Mrs' Hawthorne hiding“.
In this strange, unfriendly house?
Why had she told me not to leave my room?
Toby! Toby!
Find the drunken fool.
Tell him to stop that shooting.
But, ma'am-
Doesn't he realize the girl's still here?
I'll try, ma'am.
Dirty, stinking, slimy gators!
You bit my hand off, didn't you?
I'm gonna spend the rest of my life killing gators.
The rest of my life killing 'em-.
Mr. Manon, you better stop it.
Huh?
Mrs. Hawthorne says stop.
She says she don't want you shooting at gators around here... with that girl here.
The one you brought.
I ain't never gonna stop shootin' gators.
They bit my hand off, didn't they?
I ain't never gonna stop shootin' gators!
No, not never!
Sure, sure.
I know just how you feel.
I don't like 'em, either, but not tonight. Come on.
Do all the guests get room service?
I only do... what Mrs. Hawthorne tell me, ma'am.
Now, will there be anything else?
Luann, those gunshots.
What were they all about?
I don't know, ma'am.
I must go now.
Luann, wait, wait, please.
Somebody has to help me.
- How, ma'am?
- Is it true, everything she told me?
Havel come to the wrong place?
I can't- I wouldn't like to say anything.
Well, can't you tell me anything?
I can tell you this.
This is a trouble house.
Real deep, big trouble.
Like the old country woman in Big Bayou say-
Mrs. Hawthorne, she deal with the evil one.
She got big sorrow.
Just like you'll get if you stay here-.
Go, child. Please go.
This is a trouble house.
Real deep, big trouble.
Yes.
Oh, thank goodness you're back, Mark.
Anything wrong, Vinnie?
She's here, Mark.
Paul's wife.
- How did she find us?
- School records.
It was like being struck by lightning.
We've got to decide what we're going to do about her.
You wait there for me.
I'll be right over.
- You ready, Doctor?
- Yes.
Poor devil.
You didn't have to hit him.
Quickest, simplest way, Doctor.
But these are people.
You don't handle them like animals.
How did it happen?
Only thing I can figure is someone forgot to wet him down on time.
When he comes to...
give him additional hydro-spray therapy
Yes, sir.
Mark!
Oh, hello, Vinnie.
We'vejust had an emergency with number six.
- Is he all right now?
- He's quiet, yes.
But the girl- what are we going to do about her?
So she found his school records.
The one thing we hadn't thought of.
- Such bad luck.
- Not entirely.
I think we both knew... she was bound to find out eventually.
It'sjust unfortunate it happened to be so soon... when we need time.
So much time.
If she should tell anyone, the police, it would spoil our last chance.
Do we have a chance?
I don't really know.
I feel so helpless, Vinnie.
We know so little.
So little.
What about the cobalt treatment?
I said reaction to X ray was encouraging.
Massive radiation from cobalt 6O might be even more effective.
Well, you have the cobalt bomb.
It arrived today.
But don't you see,
Vinnie?
Before I can take the chance with a human being... there must be months of tests-.
Hundreds ofanimal experiments.
We took a chance once before, Vinnie.
No one knows better than you the tragic result.
I have confidence in you, Mark.
Every confidence.
You'll have time.
All the time you need.
The girl will leave on the morning train.
I'll be over before that to talk to her.
I'm as anxious as you are to have her go... but we must make absolutely sure... that she doesn't know anything.
G,'
Somehow I seemed drawn to the music.
A theme that I had heard before...
somewhere.
Who else lived in this strange household?
Who could be playing in the dead of night?
I couldn? rid myself of the premonition”.
that each step was taking me closer...
to the secret contained in this shadowy house.
I had to know.
I had to find out.
Who was he, this man who had been playing?
And why would he run away into the swamp...
when he saw me?
Muddy footprints”.
yet there had been no rain.
And the piano keys-
Still wet...
from his fingers.
What's she doing here?
I don't know.
She came on the train today-
- No notice, no warning.
- And you let her stay?
What could I do?
I couldnT turn her out in the swamp.
Do you think
I wanted her here?
There's no train until tomorrow.
- How'd you find out?
- She was in the hall.
Downstairs?
I locked her in her room.
She's got to leave... on that morning train tomorrow.
I'm Dr. Sinclair.
Uh, Mark Sinclair.
I'm sort of the swamp doctor.
That's my swamp buggy.
I need to get around.
I see. You must keep busy,
Doctor.
Well, why do you say that?
I mean, in an unhealthy environment like this.
Oh, you mean the swamp.
Well, actually, if it were as you say- unhealthy-
None of us would be here.
- Why?
- Well, a few million years ago... most of the land of the earth... musfve looked just about like this-
One great, vast swamp.
It was the cradle oflife... where we all started- in the slime and ooze... at the bottom of a swamp.
- You're completely cynical, aren't you, Doctor? -
I imagine that did sound a bit depressing.
I didn't mean it to.
I'm sorry.
Oh, is Mrs. Hawthorne inside?
Well, she hasn't come down yet.
Has she been ill,
Doctor?
Well, not exactly.
Vinnie- Mrs. Hawthorne- has a few emotional problems.
I like to look in from time to time.
Well, maybe that explains it.
- Explains what?
- Why she locked me in my room last night.
I don't understand.
I took you for a guest ofVinnie's-.
I suppose I am, in a way.
I'm Mrs. Webster.
Mrs. Paul Webster.
That name doesn't mean anything to you?
No. Should it?
I don't know.
Let me explain, Doctor.
Since my husband disappeared,
I've done nothing but search for him...
and I'm going to keep on asking questions.
- What brings you here?
- An old address-
The Cypresses- that I found in Paul's college records-.
You came way down here, traveled hundreds ofmiles... on nothing more tangible than that?
I'd travel much farther on even less.
I find that difficult to believe.
You must've found other evidence.
Why? Unless there is other evidence.
Is that what you mean?
Of course not- I was only trying to say-
You did know Paul, didn't you, Doctor?
I can tell.
What is it, Doctor?
Why won't any of you tell me about him?
What are you all trying to hide?
My dearyoung lady, you're obviously overwrought.
That's understandable in the circumstances.
I wish I could help.
Will you tell Mrs. Hawthorne
I couldn't wait... but I will drop back later?
Thank you.
Be extremely careful'
It generates
3,000 curie units...
ofgamma ray energy
This is the equivalent of six million electron volts of X ray
A few seconds of direct exposure”. would be fatal.
Stand by for lowering position.
- Luann, come here!
- Yes, ma'am.
- Her things are still in her room.
- Yes, ma'am.
You mean she didn't leave?
Well, Toby, he brought the car at train time... but Mrs. Webster, she wouldn't go.
- Well,where is she?
- Well, I believe she in there.
What are you doing?
Looking for answers.
Answers?
You abuse my hospitality.
You were to stay in your room.
You left it.
You promised to leave on the train.
I made no promise.
I was told.
I'm not leaving here,
Mrs. Hawthorne... until I get the answers to the questions that brought me here.
I told you yesterday you were mistaken.
- I thinkyou're lying.
- You can't talk to me like that.
I can say a lot worse.
You had Dr. Sinclair come and talk to me today, didn't you?
Why?
To find out how much I knew?
I know nothing about that.
And another thing-
Who was playing the piano in here last night... in the dark?
Someone who left wet footprints in the carpet?
- Oh,you're imagining things.
- No, I'm not-
Any more than I'm imagining you want to get rid of me... that you've got something to hide.
Hide? Oh, what could I possibly have to hide?
What have you done with my husband?
I don't know what you're talking about.
You did a good job,
Mrs. Hawthorne... wiping out every trace of Paul in his own home.
You almost got away with it.
Got away with it?
Got away with what?
Whatever terrible thing you've done with Paul.
Done to him? Me?
Oh, my God, that's funny.
That really is funny.
I 'd be the last one ever to hurt Paul.
I'm his mother.
His mother?
Mother?
Has she gone?
No, Paul, she hasn't. Paul, what is it?
What happened?
Paul!
Paul, come back!
Paul! Please!
Paul!
Paul!
Paul!
Paul'
Paul'
Paul!
Paul!
Paul!
Paul'
Paul!
Come on.
You ought to have better sense, sweetheart.
Nobody goes out in a swamp on a night like this-
Especial/y a night like this.
Come on. I'll take you back to the house-.
There, now.
Now you sit down.
You sit down.
That's it.
What you needs a drink.
Me too.
I don't understand why you brought me here-.
I just naturally figured you'd appreciate me saving you from that snake.
I do.
- Here- Have a drink-
- I don't think I want it-.
Go on, baby.
It'll do you good.
That's it.
Made it myself.
Hey... you're cold.
You ought to get them wet things off.
Go ahead.
Well, come on.
Get 'em off.
I'll be all right.
Thanks.
All right, baby.
Here.
You get up.
We'll wrap this around you... so you won't catch cold.
Now, come on. Get up.
That's it.
Stop! Let go of me.
What's the matter, baby?
Huh? Didn't I save your life?
Don't you feel like you owe me something?
Why, sure, you do.
You be nice to me.
Maybe I'll tell you some things about this place.
Don't do that.
Don't ever do that!
You're dead!
I'll kill you. alligator man!
Lust like I'd kill any four-legged gator!
You hear me?
I'll killyou!
Oh! Paul, what happened?
- She's not dead?
- Manon. He was drunk.
We should've fired him before.
Toby, carry her upstairs.
Luann, try and take care of her.
Yes, ma'am.
We can't keep her in the dark any longer, Paul.
- I can't do anything.
- She could've been killed tonight.
Is that what you want?
- I love her, Mother.
- Well, that's why she has to know.
- Are you going to tell her?
- I couldn't.
I'll phone Dr. Sinclair.
He'll know what to say.
Oh, why didn't he just let me die?
It'll work out somehow, Paul.
There has to be an answer.
Therejust has to be.
Mark?
Paul.
I understand it came.
The cobalt 60?
Arrived yesterday.
When do we try it?
Not for months.
I explained to your mother.
Combined with the X-ray generator... the bomb will approach the power of a betatron-
A billion electron volts.
So without extensive experimentation-
But there's no time for that.
I want it now.
You don't think
I'd take the risk... after the tragedy
I've caused already?
But you're causing a worse one to my wife.
You said yourselfthe X ray was definitely helping.
Light positive indications, yes.
Then combining X ray with gamma radiation... from the cobalt might cure me completely.
And it might kill you!
Paul... who knows?
I just can't do it, Paul.
It's too great a risk.
We wouldn't be alive at all, any of us, except for you.
We'd probably be better off dead, but-... you can't turn me down.
You owe me this chance... whatever chance there is.
For my wife's sake,
I want it now!
Not tonight!
I'll need at least a day to test it on live alligators... to establish some sort of control standards-.
You'vejust got to understand, Paul.
I haven't the slightest idea what will happen.
Tomorrow night.
Tomorrow night.
Paul... your mother phoned about your wife.
You should've told her, Paul.
I couldn't.
The thought ofjoyce ever seeing me like this-
I just couldn't.
I've agreed to talk tojoyce in the morning.
- But-
- She's going to know everything.
Yeah, get the big one.
You're Mrs. Webster?
Yes.
Dr. Sinclair is expecting me.
The doctor said for you to wait in his office.
Take him out.
Put him in a cage alone.
We'll run the test series on him in an hour.
And bring in another specimen.
I hope you'll excuse me,
Mrs. Webster... keeping you waiting.
This experiment was urgent-
The most urgent of my life.
So, you're a trained nurse,
Mrs. Webster?
- Yes. Yes, that's right.
- Good.
Then you know something of the life processes... of the higher and lower orders.
In species like ourselves... with a highly developed nervous system... bodily functions are controlled principally... by the brain and the nerves.
But in creatures with a less complex nervous development... life processes are governed by chemical substances...
secreted by ductless glands“. and carried in their bloodstream.
Like hormones?
Being a doctor, I was tremendously impressed... by the healing power ofjust one hormone-
Hydrocortisone.
And it occurred to me how much more potent this hormone would be... in a creature with a simpler nervous system-
One that depended on that hormone to live.
For example... there are some small lizards that when attacked... detach their tails completely.
Yet, in a very short time... well, this little fella was well on his way to growing a new one.
There are even one or two species... that can replace an entire limb ifthey've lost one.
Here's something intriguing-
Two similar muscular charts.
You might think they were the same animal... but as you know, this is a man-
This is an alligator.
This is all very interesting, Doctor... but you were going to tell me about Paul.
Everything I've said concerns Paul.
I knew I'd found my life's work.
I wanted to extract this wonderful reptilian substance... and use it to cure human injuries.
Mrs. Hawthorne-
She was still
Mrs. Webster then-
She remarried after Paul's father died-
Mrs. Hawthorne financed my researches... and set up this clinic.
Well, did you succeed?
I isolated a protein chemical... from the anterior pituitary glands... of crocodilians.
- Our common variety is the alligator.
- Alligator?
I injected this substance into the veins ofvolunteers-
Horribly injured, hopelessly mangled accident victims... on the point of death.
It was miraculous,
Mrs. Webster.
Not only 070' those dying men and women live...
but in an incredibly short time, they were completely whole-
Mangled limbs as good as new... as ifthey'd never been injured.
And Paul was one of these?
The worst of the lot.
There was scarcely a bone in his body that wasn't broken- face completely gone...
horribly burned'
“Nobody would even know you were in a plane crash.“
That's what I said to Paul the night we were married.
Can you imagine my feelings?
I thought I'd stumbled on the medical miracle of the ages.
- It certainly seems so.
- Then, over a year later-
Doctor, can you come right away?
It's number six again.
Excuse me.
I'll be back soon.
Maybe you'd better come along, too.
Another sedative,
Doctor?
No.
I'm afraid the brain tissues have been affected.
Try a sun ray.
Yes, Doctor.
Who are these?
My prize patients.
My medical miracles.
- Well, then, these symptoms are-
- The aftereffects.
They began to appear in varying degrees...
about a year after the treatment.
Why? How?
Isn't it obvious?
There was an additional secretion... in the pituitary injection besides the healing hormone-
Something
I didn't know about...
but, in its way, even more powerful'
And the sun ray?
The sun ray has a strong depressant effect... on reptiles.
Makes them lethargic, dormant.
Reptiles?
But these aren't-
They are, aren't they?
Your patients are turning into-
Alligators.
In effect, you can say that.
- Alligator people.
- And Paul?
His symptoms were the last to appear.
When his final test proved positive...
I had to wire him on the train.
He's quiet now.
We can go.
Is there any hope for... for the people?
There may be a possible chance... but a slight one-
A shot in the dark and very dangerous.
Your husband insists upon taking that chance tonight.
What is it?
Massive radiation-
Gamma rays from a cobalt bomb... combined with high intensity X rays-.
We've already noted in Paul... definite positive reactions to X-ray treatment... but what will happen with this...
- I don't know.
- I want to be here.
- I don't think that's wise-
- I want to be here.
I want to see Paul. I want to talk to him before-
You can't keep me away, Doctor.
No, I guess I can't.
Maybe I haven't even got the right.
Paul, please.
Don't run away again.
Dr. Sinclair explained you were coming tonight and why.
I wanted to be here.
Oh.
Paul, it doesn't make any difference.
I'm your wife, and I love you-.
Oh, Paul, darling.
You know all about tonight?
Dr. Sinclair explained.
He told me about the X-ray treatments... and how much better you are-.
I know this'll do it,
Paul.
Why, radiation therapy works wonders.
It'll have to.
You'll come out of that laboratory... as handsome as ever.
Joyce...
I love you.
You know that.
I wouldn't have done this to you- let you see me.
I'd rather have died!
Oh, Paul, please.
Don't say that.
We're... ready, Paul.
If you still want to.
I still want to.
Very well.
Stand by for lowering position.
- Ready, Paul?
- Ready.
Oh, Paul, do you have to do this-... take this chance, knowing the danger?
Whatever happens, either way...
I'm better off than the way I am now.
Oh, Paul.
I'm sorry for the way
I treated you.
Paul was so desperate to keep you from knowing.
We did everything we could.
Now that I know you,
I'm sure we were wrong.
I'm sorry.
Terribly sorry.
Manon!
Where is he?
- Who?
- Paul.
He's not here.
You get out of here.
Mrs. Hawthorne ordered you off this place for good.
I know where he is, where he's got to be!
With the others!
Now you go on!
Get out!
Controls and timing must be precise.
When you're dealing with radioactivity... and billions ofvolts of energy-... the slightest deviational standard... even a few seconds of excess time-.- ... and anything might happen.
What's the exposure interval, Doctor?
No more than 3O seconds.
Absolute maximum.
I determined that on my test alligators.
Definitely.
30 seconds.
No more.
Paul.
Yes?
I'll never be able to tell you... how sorry I am-.
Don't blame yourself.
I certainly don't.
Who can know everything?
You're not God, Mark.
I feel as ifl've been playing at it... and been punished.
Forget it.
You all right?
Fine.
Keep your eyes closed.
Just relax.
Where is he?
Who do you want?
That two-legged gator- Paul.
You better get out of here.
Aw.
Wait! You can't go in there!
Manon! You were ordered to leave.
You have no right here.
Now get out.
Where is he?
I know you got him here someplace.
I forbid you to go in there.
Oh.
So he is here, huh?
Get him out of here!
Why, you-
Get out of here!
So that's where you are.
You can't!
You can't go in there!
No, you ain't him.
You can't be him.
You stay away from me!
Paul!
Paul!
Paul!
Paul'
Paul!
Paul!
Paul!
Paul! Paul!
No!
Don't! Don't! No!
Well, now that you've heard the tape again, what do you think?
This indicates that everything she said is true.
She was married to a Paul Webster who did crash in a plane... and there was a Dr. Mark Sinclair who since disappeared.
Do you believe her story?
That's not important.
Eric... we were both taught that a psychiatrisfs function... is to find mental illness and to cure it.
- As simple as that.
- Obviously.
Now,jane's case-
This girl has lived through a horrible experience... true or not, but she has made... a satisfactory adjustment.
She lives a normal, happy life by completely suppressing it.
An obvious anxiety neurosis... and amnesia suppression.
You didn't need me to tell you that.
No, of course not.
But what am I gonna do, Eric?
Shall I let her go on as she is now or attempt a cure?
Now, all I've got to do is bring her back in here... and play back that tape.
Yes, and perhaps shock her into a complete withdrawal.
Yes.
I don't know, Wayne.
I honestly don't know.
Excuse me, Doctor.
I'm going offduty unless there's something else.
All right.
Thank you.
Oh,jane.
One moment.
Well?
Yes, Doctor?
That's alLjane.
Good night.
Good night, Doctor.
- Good night, Dr. Lorimer.
- Goodn/ghzfljane.
Once, the world was big and no man in his lifetime could circle it.
Through the centuries, science has made man's lifetime bigger and the world smaller.
Now the farthest corner of the Earth is as close as a pushbutton.
And time has lost all meaning as manmade devices speed many, many times faster than sound itself.
Here, near the top of the world, free men struggle with the elements to create some measure of defense to protect that self-same freedom.
Distant Early Warning radar, sensitive electronic devices to detect the presence of objects in the sky, including bombing planes and guided missiles and rain clouds and homing pigeons.
New radar installations must be calibrated by the flying of controlled test flights to check the accuracy of the equipment and to chart a detection profile of the area in order to pinpoint blind spots the radar cannot penetrate.
Bravo 8035. Angels 9.
Bravo 7540. Angels 9.
Bravo 7045. Angels 9.
Test Flight. Test Flight. This is
Snowman Three. Give me a reading. Over.
Snowman Three, this is Test Flight.
Flying vector, 340 degrees from IP.
Angels 10. Speed, 400.
How do you read me? Over.
Everything checks but the altitude, Mitch.
We read you at Angels 9.
Altimeter reads 10,000 on the nose.
Better check the level on the antenna mount.
Roger.
How about Mademoiselle Mathematician?
She got enough numbers to feed into her machines yet?
Do you have all the information you need, Miss Caldwell?
One more run, please. Low level coming in.
One more, Mitch. Vector 105 degrees, low.
Roger. Turning 180 degrees, low approach.
This is Test Flight, over and out.
I didn't know pilots were allowed to do things like that.
Not Air Force pilots, you're right.
But Mitch is an electronics engineer.
He may work for the government, but, ma'am, he kinda makes his own rules.
So does a three-year-old child until his mother spanks him.
- Mother, dear mother, I'm ready if you are.
- I must have left the switch on.
An electronics engineer. A radar officer.
A mathematician and systems analyst.
A radar operator. A couple of plotters.
People doing a job, well, efficiently.
Serious, having fun. Doing a job.
Situation, normal for the moment.
Date, the 17th of the month.
Sky cloudy, overcast. Visibility limited.
Time, 1332 hours.
A significant moment in history.
A moment when an electronics engineer named Mitchell MacAfee saw something in the sky.
Something that was almost the beginning of the end of life on this Earth.
MacAfee reported instantly by radio the sighting of a UFO, an unidentified flying object.
The radar officer replied that it was impossible.
According to the radar scope, except for Mitch's plane, there wasn't a single, solitary object of any nature whatsoever.
Nothing in the sky for a radius of hundreds of miles.
MacAfee didn't care what the radar showed or didn't show.
He knew what he saw with his own eyes.
And he was determined to get a better look.
MacAfee turned, and so did the unidentified flying object heading toward him.
There was no mistaking the urgency in MacAfee's voice.
Something, he didn't know what, but something as big as a battleship had just flown over and past him at speeds so great he couldn't begin to estimate it.
In national defense, it's better to be safe than sorry.
The alert was sounded to scramble interceptors.
- Well?
- Well, what?
Now, let's not play games, Major.
Did your men find it?
Mr. MacAfee, if you were in uniform,
I'd have you under arrest and facing general court martial charges.
Unfortunately, you're a civilian.
- And I can't touch you.
- What are you talking about?
But I can send in a report in on you and I will.
By the time I get through with you,
Mr. Electronics Engineer, you'll be lucky if they let you test batteries for flashlights.
Look, Major Bergen, I was flying a final calibration flight.
I spotted a UFO, I reported it.
Does that make me a criminal, a traitor to my country, or some kind of a psychopath?
MacAfee, you're an electronics man, an expert on radar.
- Sure, that's what they pay me for.
- If there was something in the air, something flying that you could see, would radar pick it up?
- Well, yes, but...
- Would radar pick it up? Yes or no?
- Yes.
- There were three radars on you.
Every minute you were in the air and not one of them, not one, saw anything but you.
- Look, Major...
- You were told this. You knew it.
Nevertheless, you persisted with your little joke.
- Easy now, Bergen.
- You continued to yell wolf until somebody pushed the panic button and scrambled a flight of interceptors.
Great. Great. So your buzz boys flew around, they couldn't find anything, so now you're mad and want me to pay for the fuel they burned up or the time they wasted or something else real smart.
The flight was scrambled and dispersed to cover as wide an area as possible.
And thanks to your not-so-funny false alarm, Mr. MacAfee, one of those planes didn't come back.
Plane and pilot, both are missing.
Major Bergen. What?
Yes. Yeah. Yes. Call out the stand-by crews.
You better reshuffle your duty rosters.
There'll be plenty of sweat on this one.
Look, Major, I'm sorry about the pilot, but that was no false alarm.
Oh, come off it, Mitch. You've done enough harm with your flying battleship.
- Just let it...
- Just a moment, Miss Caldwell.
That call. A Transpolar Airlines plane is reported overdue and missing.
- Oh, no!
- Sixty passengers and a full crew aboard.
Got a distress call from the pilot, then nothing. No more contact.
- Engine trouble?
- No.
The pilot yelled something about a UFO.
Then the radio went dead.
- And our radars?
- Nothing. Nothing but the Transpolar plane.
Alone in the sky.
Well, we're finished up here, Major.
- You got transportation ready?
- Plane and pilot in the field.
- Fly you straight through to New York.
- Thanks. Let's go, Sally.
Hang on. I'll be back in a minute.
Hi, Pete. Getting too rough to work back there.
I thought the poop on the weather was we'd have it soft all the way into New York.
- Seems to be a local front, Mitch.
- How about flying over it?
Can do. Wait till I call in.
This is Air Force Zebra Love 7979 calling
New York International Airport. Over.
Zebra Love 7979.
This is New York International Airport. Over.
Altitude 8,000, air speed 250.
Meeting unexpected storm activity,
Adirondack region.
Request permission to change altitude to 12,000. Over.
Zebra Love 7979. Permission granted. Over.
Zebra Love 7979. Roger. Out.
- Like I said, no sweat.
- Thanks, Pete.
I'll put in a good word for you with the Major.
Oh, thanks loads.
Well, I won't know until I run it through the computer, but it looks like the profiler that dips here like this for an extensive blind spot.
Yeah.
Well, either that antenna is really tilted or we've got a topographical high spot here we didn't figure on that's shading the whole strip.
- Could you get that relief map?
- Oh, yes. Right here.
Mitch. Mitch. Come up here!
- What gives?
- Sit down, Mitch.
- Well?
- Something might be coming up.
- Such as what?
- Unidentified flying object.
- Flew right over us.
- Not you, too.
Oh, save the cracks.
I've already called it in to International.
Mitch, I sure enough saw something like a cloud.
Only it was moving too fast for any cloud.
Right at our course from northeast.
Two bits it never showed up on a single radar scope.
- What?
- Never mind. I don't see anything but sky.
Neither do I, now.
I lost it when it got right overhead.
Where'd that come from?
We don't register a hatful of wind.
Brother, that was more than a hatful.
- Are you all right?
- I think so. How about you?
I'm okay. Pete's in bad shape. Let's go.
Down! It's going to blow up.
What happened? It felt like something collided with us up there.
Yeah. The flying battleship that wasn't there.
- Hello! Hello!
- Here. Over here.
It's good applejack. I make it myself.
Fine for the snakebite.
Hello, Pierre. Mr. MacAfee?
That's right.
That the pilot?
Yeah.
Okay, boys.
They made a reservation for you on a commercial flight into New York City.
Sending a car to take you and the young lady to the airport.
What about the wrecked plane?
We've got orders to seal off the area.
Real hush-hush.
What happened? You tangle with a flying saucer or something?
Oh, nothing so domestic as a flying saucer, Officer. Just a flying battleship.
Well, have a good time with your flying battleship.
Your car will be here soon.
- Where's the plane, Pierre?
- North 14, past the road.
Let's go, boys.
Hello? Oui, this is the farm of Pierre Broussard.
Who? Oh, one moment.
A General Van Buskirk for you,
Mr. MacAfee.
I feel another snakebite coming on.
More medicine.
Well, flying battleship, pink elephant.
Same difference.
You really should try buttermilk instead.
I said it looked like a battleship, not that it was a battleship.
I should have called it an overgrown adding machine.
Then at least you would've believed me.
General Buskirk? MacAfee here.
Yes, sir. I am aware that the pilot called in a UFO.
No, I didn't see anything myself this time.
Neither did Miss Caldwell.
Oh, the radar picked up nothing but our plane in the area.
Well, I was kind of expecting that too.
Joke? False alarm?
Look here, General, what kind of an infantile jackass do you take me for? I tell you that...
Thank you.
Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
I understand, sir.
When the shepherd cried wolf, they believed him. The first time at least.
Civil Aeronautics Board is sending up an investigating team first thing in the morning.
So is the Air Force, as soon as the CAB is done.
When we get to New York, we're to keep ourselves available for questioning.
This glass must have a hole in it.
Keeps disappearing.
- How's the jug holding up, Pierre?
- You like Pierre's applejack, oui?
Ah, perfect antidote for snakebite, thunder, lightning, and disbelieving generals.
Fill her up, Pierre.
- What's that?
- Something scared the animal!
It's Pierre!
Over here.
Easy, Pierre, easy. You're safe.
You're in the house.
- Carcagne! It was the carcagne! I saw her!
- What's a carcagne, Pierre?
- Come on, tell us about it.
- It's the devil in the storm.
With the face of the wolf and the body of the woman with wings.
- Bigger than I can tell.
- You probably saw an eagle, Pierre.
- Oh, no! It was la carcagne! La carcagne!
- Oh, I remember now.
I read it somewhere. It's a superstition, a legend that the French Canadians started and came across the border with.
Yeah. It vaguely rings a small bell with me, too.
It was probably just the lightning and the storm, Pierre.
- You just imagined the whole thing.
- No! No! I saw la carcagne!
Here. Take another swallow of this.
Come in.
What's the matter with Pierre?
He thinks he saw something weird in the sky.
I saw her. I saw la carcagne!
- He can't get it out of his head.
- Yeah, I know.
I live up this way myself.
There's a lot of the old folks around here believe that yarn.
But this is the first time I ever heard anybody claim he really saw the old witch.
- You come to take us to the airport?
- Yeah. Car outside.
- Oh, I hate to leave him like this.
- Oh, don't worry, ma'am.
Joe here will stay with him.
But we'd better hurry.
- They're holding that plane for you.
- Come on, Sally.
They're holding a plane for us, we'd better get with it.
We haven't even thanked him.
I'm afraid the social amenities won't mean very much to a man in Pierre's condition.
He's right, ma'am. You'd never get through, the way he's scared stiff right now.
Scared? So he thought he saw a big bird.
Why should that paralyze him so with fright?
- Didn't he tell you?
- Tell us what?
The legend. According to the story they tell, if you see this big bird, it's a sign that you're going to die real soon.
- That plane's waiting. We'd better go.
- Okay, Sergeant.
"The kiss you take is better than you give."
A many-faceted creature, this Mr. MacAfee.
First engineer and pilot and now lover and poet.
Oh, the line of poetry was from Shakespeare.
I know, but where did that impulse come from?
- Left field, maybe.
- I like baseball.
Or maybe just sitting next to a pretty girl.
That's enough in itself, sometimes.
Even sitting next to Mademoiselle Mathematician?
Or should we stick to the baseball reference?
There are figures and there are figures.
Inescapable logic, corny but true.
You almost overwhelm me.
Almost?
Well, let's finish the job.
Look at that moon.
Speaking of baseball and left field, somebody warned me that you make up your own rules.
- Whoever said that's no friend of mine.
- But he's a friend of mine.
Sabotage!
Oh, much too dramatic.
Let's stick to baseball and say instead,
- "Out, trying to steal second."
- Back to the bush leagues, finished.
A quitter. I knew it. No fight, no spirit.
Of course, the umpire could always reverse her decision.
No, no short cuts. Must follow the pattern.
First the minor leagues, and then the major leagues.
- I stick to the rules, Mitch. Sorry about that.
- Why be sorry? You can always...
Pattern.
- Pattern.
- What's the matter?
Pattern. I need one of your maps.
The orthographic projection, the pole to equator.
- Give it to me, will you?
- Well, sure.
I think I have it here somewhere.
Ah. Here it is.
What's that?
Open your map.
Now, where I sighted the UFO.
Where the search plane disappeared.
The Transpolar airliner.
Our plane at Pierre's.
And finally the Navy patrol plane.
- Well, you were muttering about a pattern.
- Well? See it?
Well, no. No straight line, no curve, nothing.
Wait.
A pattern.
A perfect pattern in time and distance.
Each incident, each cross, later than the one before.
Each one further out in the spiral from the center.
You mean, something in the air flew a pattern like that?
Yeah. Something I saw.
Something that flew over and past me in the air.
Well, it would have to be traveling at incredible speed to cover
- all the distance in the time involved.
- Yeah, it would.
Something that seemingly destroyed four planes and barely missed you the first time.
Yes.
Something like your flying battleship?
- Okay, forget the whole thing.
- Oh, well, now, Mitch. Be reasonable.
Why that pattern, just to knock down a few scattered planes?
And what? A meteorite? Impossible!
A guided missile?
Well, that would stop with the first plane it hit.
And who would launch it?
And for what reason?
No, Mitch, coincidence, yes. But pattern, no.
Here's your map.
Well, you are a child. Mitch, think!
If there was anything flying this kind of a pattern, why, it would be tracked by dozens of different radars.
And none of them spotted a thing, so what?
Well, maybe it was Pierre's carcagne,
"with the head of a wolf and the body of a woman, with wings as big as I can tell!"
- There's no need to be sarcastic.
- Look, would you two mind being quiet so the rest of us can sleep? Thank you.
Sorry. Maybe I was being childish.
Mitch MacAfee, flying Sherlock Holmes.
I think you did make better sense with your poetry than you did with your detective deductions.
- I know another poem.
- Oh?
"Be plain in dress and sober in your diet.
"In short, my deary, kiss me, and be quiet."
Date, the 18th of the month.
Sky clear, light clouds. Visibility unlimited.
Time, 0815 hours.
A CAB plane flies toward the scene of the previous day's crash involving Mitchell MacAfee.
On board, four members of the
Civil Aeronautics Board investigating team.
And a pilot.
Time, 0816 hours.
Another significant moment in history.
Once more a frantic pilot radios in a report on a UFO. A bird.
A bird as big as a battleship, circling and preparing to attack the CAB plane.
Stop leaning on the buzzer. I'm coming.
Mr. MacAfee?
- Or a reasonable facsimile thereof.
- General Buskirk's respects, sir.
- He'd like to see you right away.
- Oh, have a heart, Captain.
I got in late last night.
I just about fell asleep when you woke me.
- Sorry, sir, the General says it's urgent.
- So is my sleep!
My orders are to bring you to the General's office at once.
Even if I have to take you into protective custody.
Okay, Captain, don't get in a tizzy. You keep your shirt on, I'll go get my pants on.
My sighting. The search plane, the Transpolar airliner, our plane at Pierre's and the Navy patrol plane. Too much, and it fits too well, to be just coincidence.
There have been two more since the Navy plane.
A private plane here last night and a CAB plane with four passengers and a pilot here.
All following your theoretical pattern smack dab on the nose.
No radar tracks, I suppose?
As usual, since you started this crazy nightmare, nothing.
Except about the planes.
Did the pilots report anything?
Not a word from the pilot of the private plane.
But the CAB pilot reported a UFO.
- Did he say what it was?
- Yes. A bird.
A bird as big as a battleship circled and attacked the plane.
- Believe me, Mr. MacAfee, this is no joke.
- Oh, no.
That plane was completely destroyed.
And all five men on board seem to have completely disappeared from the face of the Earth.
Now, you're an electronics expert.
Could there have been anything that big up in the sky and not be picked up by radar?
Impossible! But I saw it myself.
Yes. Three men reported they saw something and two of them are now dead.
Well, that makes me chief cook and bottle washer in a one-man bird watcher's society.
Mr. MacAfee, this is vitally important.
Did you get a good look at it?
No, it was just a blur as it went past.
How I wish I'd had a camera with me.
Camera! General Buskirk, before I went out on this radar assignment with Mitch, I was doing Earth curvature calibration work.
Well, how does that help us on this?
Well, we used film strips photographed from inside test rockets and from fixed cameras and observation balloons.
- Sally, maybe you've got it!
- If those balloons are still up, there's a bare possibility they photographed this thing, whatever it is.
General Edward Considine, Pentagon.
Priority, fast!
Something's coming up now.
Kill it!
This film and all the information pertaining to it and the bird are classified as top secret.
Notify all agencies and personnel involved who have handled the project or will handle it.
Yes, sir.
- Johnson!
- Yes, sir?
Put the entire command on combat readiness right away.
Notify the Pentagon and have them tell
General Considine I'm on my way.
Yes, sir.
Colonel Tyler at the field? Line one, please.
Oh, Nate. Nate. Buskirk here.
Warm up my plane.
And file a flight plan for me to National, Washington. Right.
We're coming now.
Two extra passengers. Okay.
You two are coming with me to Washington.
Miss Caldwell. Mr. MacAfee.
It's some sort of bird all right.
There's no question of that.
Miss Caldwell, is it possible that this bird has been flying in blind spot areas
- that our radar can't pick up?
- No, sir. I checked carefully.
At least ten different radar sites should have tracked it.
Mr. MacAfee, could speed or altitude affect the ability of our radar to pick it up?
No. There's no scientific or any other kind of reason in the world why our radars don't track it.
They just don't. Period.
Then what you're saying in essence, is that black is white and two and two make six.
Look, General, I didn't invent this flying nightmare, I just saw it and reported it.
The General understands, Mr. MacAfee.
He's not blaming you for anything.
Relax, man.
Relax? When do we stop relaxing and start doing something?
Good sense isn't confined exclusively to civilians, Mr. MacAfee.
We know how to take care of ourselves and the country.
Easy, Van, easy. Take it easy.
There's a general air alert on this very minute, son.
Hundreds of planes from every command are combing the skies, searching for this overgrown buzzard.
- We'll find it all right. Never fear.
- And when we do, General. Then what?
Yes? Good! Where?
Okay, this is official now.
Pass 'em the word to shoot it down.
No questions, no games, no stalling.
Just shoot it down. Yes.
Get me a tape on all air-to-ground and air-to-air channels, and pipe it through a hotline to me here.
One of our squadrons just spotted it.
I've ordered them to attack and shoot it down.
Our planes are armed with cannon, machine guns and rockets.
This should be the end of the big bird who was there but wasn't.
You'll be able to hear it as it happens.
This is Easy Baker squadron leader.
- Target below and to the side. See it?
- Yow! Holy Toledo!
I've seen some mighty big chicken hawks back on the farm, but, man, this baby takes the cake.
Honest to pete, I'll never call my mother-in-law an old crow again.
This is Easy Baker squadron leader.
Peel off on signal.
One pass and then you're on your own.
This is Easy Baker squadron leader.
It's got one of the planes.
I must be losing my marbles.
This isn't for real.
Bullets, rockets, nothing touches it.
Easy Baker squadron leader.
Charlie hit the silk when the bird got his plane and now it...
Charlie's gone. Chute and all.
It don't make sense.
Like we're hitting a battleship with a slingshot.
It's going after another plane. Look out!
Easy Baker squadron leader.
Mission's a washout.
We're going to head for... No!
It's coming after me! No! No!
Machine guns, cannons, rockets, nothing touched it.
- Those pilots...
- We'll find it, all right, never fear.
The end of the big bird.
You were right, Miss Caldwell, when we find it, what then?
Phase two off standby, operational.
- Notify the Joint Chiefs.
- Yes, sir.
It doesn't make sense.
It's just a bird, a big bird.
- Guns. Cannons. Rockets. It's just a bird.
- Sure, it's just a bird.
Ten million dollars worth of radar can't track it.
Enough firepower to wipe out a regiment can't even slow it down.
Sure, it's just a bird.
Well, what are we going to do, just sit around here and weep?
- Oh, climb off our backs, MacAfee.
- We're not crying, MacAfee, and we're not running away.
But it's hard to come up with answers when you don't even know what the question is.
Being flip doesn't help any.
I'm not criticizing either of you or the Air Force or those guys who just died trying to shoot that thing down.
I'm not being flip, and I'm not wisecracking.
I'm just scared. We all are, I guess.
So let's face that and then try and do something about that bird.
- Any suggestions, MacAfee?
- Sure, electronic spitballs!
- Van.
- Close, General, close.
Only not electronic spitballs, atomic spitballs.
- Yes?
- Phase two operational.
- All units alerted and ready.
- Good.
Call for you.
Dr. Karol Noymann at the research lab.
I'll take it on two.
This is General Considine, Dr. Noymann.
Say that again? Good, good.
You stay where you are. I'll be right over.
Research lab's been kept right up to date.
They've been working on the wreckage of that CAB plane
- and the plane that you two cracked up in.
- Find anything new, Ed?
They think they've figured out what that bird is and where it came from.
About those atomic spitballs.
An hour before your plane landed in Washington,
I ordered guided missiles with atomic warheads made ready for every launching site in the country where the fallout pattern makes it safe to explode them.
The order you heard me give to make phase two operational was an order to fire those missiles the moment that bird is spotted anywhere!
- General, I'm sorry, I guess I...
- Don't apologize, son, I admire your spunk.
And you keep climbing on our backs whenever we've messed up any of the detail.
- Van?
- Sorry, Mac.
- I guess we're all trying to do our best.
- You two better come along.
You're up to your ears in this thing anyway.
Come on, let's go.
The atom is the basic building block of all matter.
The atom this model represents is like every atom as we know it.
The nucleus is positive.
The electrons are all negative.
In this respect, it has been maintained that all atoms are alike.
But this is wrong, all wrong!
According to the law of electrodynamics, all nature is symmetrical.
It is in balance. And if there is matter, then there must also be antimatter, a symmetrical mirror image.
Now here we have a positive nucleus, negative electrons.
In the reverse, we must obviously have a negative nucleus with positive electrons.
Science has proved that this is so, not in this Earth nor in this solar system but somewhere in the universe there are stars, planets, whole galaxies made up of antimatter.
Well, do you mean to say, Doctor, that this bird is made of antimatter?
That it's reversed, inside out, a mirror image, as you call it?
Just a minute, General.
Doctor, it's been proven that antimatter exists, but it's also been proven that whenever it comes in contact with ordinary matter, they annihilate one another, blow up.
Why didn't the bird explode when it was hit, or when it touched something?
Well, you are both right and wrong.
The bird itself is not antimatter.
But the bird unquestionably radiates some sort of force, an energy screen, some invisible barrier.
And that energy screen is antimatter.
Guns, cannons, rockets, no wonder nothing touched it.
Stuff hit the antimatter screen and blew up before it could get close.
- Mitch, this explains the failure of the radar.
- Yeah.
No reflecting surface. The radar waves wouldn't bounce off, they'd slide around.
So with no echo, no tracks.
Dr. Noymann, a couple of questions.
All this isn't just guesswork on your part?
No, it is not guesswork, General.
Evidently, this bird is able to open that antimatter screen to use its beak, its claws, its wings as destructive weapons.
Now, here is part of the wreckage.
Examination by a staff of scientists has told us the whole incredible story.
It has been checked and double-checked.
- Is there anything else, General?
- Yes, Doctor.
Where did this bird come from?
Here is a piece of feather from the bird, found in the wreckage.
At least, we call it a feather, we don't know what it is.
Only what it looks like.
It has defied chemical analysis, the electroscope, every conceivable test.
It contains no substance known on the Earth today, no element recognizable by man.
- Finding that out was expensive.
- Well, how so?
We had several of these feathers, this is the only piece left.
As a last resort, we tried testing them in electronic analyzers.
Look.
That bird is extraterrestrial.
It comes from outer space, from some godforsaken antimatter galaxy millions and millions of light years from the Earth.
No other explanation is possible.
Van will fly you two back to New York.
I'd appreciate it if you'd hold yourselves in readiness and, of course, you understand that everything that you've seen and heard is classified.
My command is ready, Ed, and waiting at the end of a hotline. Just phone.
Just phone, Van? Well, I'll need help, all the help I can get. We all will.
The only trouble is that the last time I talked to a chaplain, there wasn't any telephone line to the one and only place where we can get the kind of help that we need.
General Considine.
This is an emergency.
Get me the Secretary of Defense.
Up to now, only one man had seen the bird and lived.
Among those who knew of it, its existence was a closely guarded secret.
But even as arrangements were made for an emergency meeting of the President, the Cabinet, the National Defense Board, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff, even then, the bird revealed itself to the world at large and complacency quickly turned to panic.
Panic, terror, and horror.
No corner of the Earth was spared the terror of looking up into God's blue sky and seeing, not peace and security, but the feathered nightmare on wings.
Oh, come in.
Well, I worked half the night running your figures through the calculating machine.
- Hope the results are what you want.
- Good. Thanks.
Mitch?
Oh. Thank you.
Oh, really. For two days and a night now, ever since we got back from Washington, you've had your nose buried in all those papers, figuring, calculating.
- Mitch, you've got to stop to sleep and eat.
- I've been busy.
What you're working on have anything to do with the bird?
To destroy the bird?
Well, will it work, Mitch?
I don't know.
I honestly haven't the faintest, foggiest idea.
It's one of those cock-eyed concepts that you pull down out of cloud eight somewhere in sheer desperation.
Said anything about this to General Buskirk or General Considine?
And have them gently remind me to stay in my own backyard? No, thanks.
What's the difference? There's only a million-to-one chance it will work.
It's just something to do instead of this deadly sitting around and waiting.
Mitch, I've been thinking about the bird, too.
Yeah, you and everybody else in the world.
Ever stop to wonder why the bird came here?
Could it have been for food?
I mean, does the bird eat, in the sense that we understand eating?
Well, Dr. Noymann says that it absorbs energy from the things it destroys, including humans, sort of a molecular osmosis.
Could it have come here to rest?
- If it did, it sure as shooting isn't.
- Right.
So far as we knew the bird just kept flying around the Earth, always flying, never stopping.
Well, that's what bothered me, so I called General Buskirk.
Mitch, remember Pierre Broussard, at the farm?
Yeah, him and his la carcagne, or whatever he thought he saw.
It just goes to prove what they always say, truth is stranger than fiction.
Well, this was no fiction.
Pierre did see something, he saw the bird.
12,000 feet up at night in a storm?
- No. The bird came down to Earth.
- But you just finished saying...
Well, General Buskirk told me they found the mark of a giant claw on a field next to Pierre Broussard's farm, and I know why.
The bird came here to build a nest.
Nest.
Eggs.
More birds.
It's got to be true.
There's just no other reason for it.
General Buskirk. MacAfee calling.
This is urgent.
Baby, gather up those papers for me, will you please? Take these, too.
General Buskirk? MacAfee.
Now, please don't argue or ask for reasons.
I'll explain later. It's desperately important.
I need a fast plane, and then a helicopter.
Please, please, General, believe me.
I know what I'm doing.
Yeah, at Broussard's place, the farm.
Right. We're leaving right now.
Sally's with me. Yes.
We'll go straight to the airport.
We interrupt this program for an important announcement.
Ladies and gentlemen, speaking from Washington,
Lieutenant General Considine,
United States Air Force.
We are faced with a crisis, a crisis for which all the nations of the world, in unprecedented cooperative action, have found as yet no solution.
Until we do, we shall not rest.
We have tried every weapon in the arsenals of the mightiest armies on Earth.
They have proven worse than useless.
Atomic, hydrogen weapons, capable of wiping cities, countries off the face of the Earth, are completely ineffective against this creature from the skies.
Two days ago, all aircraft were grounded.
Deprived of its source of food or energy, however the bird survives, the bird began a series of attacks on the ground, in a fantastic orgy of destruction never before seen.
Nothing has been safe from attack by the bird, cattle, horses, fields, homes, trains, all manner of transportation.
It has become obvious that the bird is attracted by movement.
Accordingly, your government and all the governments of the world have declared a state of emergency and instituted martial law.
In addition to grounding all aircraft, all surface transportation, cars, trucks, buses, trains, ships at sea, all such traffic must be halted at once.
The movement of food and essential supplies will be handled by the armed forces.
Blackout conditions will be observed from sunset to dawn every night until further notice.
Movement of any sort on the streets or highways during the daylight hours must be held to an absolute minimum and only where it has been authorized as essential.
You have just heard General Considine speaking from Washington. Stay tuned...
Mitch!
Well, that plane is waiting for us.
We've gotta get up to Pierre's place.
There it is!
We'd better land before that decides to do it again.
The guns.
Two Weatherby.378 Magnums, they'll stop anything.
Anything, Mitch?
Well, anything but the bird, but we're looking for eggs.
Without antimatter energy screens, you hope.
- La carcagne?
- No, Pepe, not la carcagne, a million times worse.
Let's get out of here.
It looks like the nest, all right.
No sign of any egg.
Well, it might be somewhere down in there.
Only way to find out is to go down there and look.
La carcagne!
An egg!
You shoot gun, make the big noise.
La carcagne come and we all die.
We have to get that egg, Pierre, it's our only chance.
Pierre, he not stay.
Pierre! Come back!
I'm from Montana.
Pierre and his la carcagne.
- He was right. Seeing it did mean his death.
- Yeah.
I'll alert Washington.
They'll get out search parties.
Everywhere in the world, wherever the bird has been sighted, just on the off chance that there might be more eggs, so they can be found and destroyed.
That much we can do.
Well, let's get back to the city.
With that bird around, it's too dangerous to fly.
We'll leave the chopper and take Pierre's car.
He won't be needing it.
- Come on, Brad, make this thing go.
- Yeah, come on.
Let's get some speed on this.
Oh, man, he ain't moving at all.
Come on! Come on!
- Some maniac driving with lights and fast.
- Maybe he didn't hear the proclamation.
I'll flag him down when he tries to pass.
- Hey, daddy-o, get that tin can off the road.
- Come on, man.
- Hey, man, who's afraid of the big bad bird?
- Turn out your lights! Get off the road!
Don't worry about us, we've got salt for its tail.
Hey, watch out for that salt, don't get it in the carbs!
Come on, let's go!
Crazy kids!
They don't know what they're doing!
- Dig you later, 'gator.
- Hey, daddy-o, don't call us, we'll call you.
- They boy is badly hurt, but he's alive.
- The girl's unconscious.
There's a town up ahead with a hospital.
We'll take them there.
You and I are going in to Washington tonight.
I'll bring the car over here for the kids.
Miss Caldwell, MacAfee, I'm a busy man.
I hope this isn't some sort of crackpot wild goose chase.
You and me both, General.
Well, it's your dime, boy.
What is it you want to show me?
- How to shoot the bird out of the sky.
- Some new type of weapon?
No, with regular guns, bullets and bombs.
Anything you want.
MacAfee, I told you that I haven't got time...
Listen, General. This idea of mine may prove to be as phony as a $3 bill,
- but I still think it's worth a listen.
- Well, go ahead.
Now I don't care whether that bird came from outer space or Upper Saddle River, New Jersey, it's still made of flesh and blood of some sort and vulnerable to bullets and bombs.
If you can get past that antimatter energy screen.
Right. That's exactly what I think, what I hope I've figured out how to do.
I've just invested a dime of my own, boy.
Keep talking.
Now, this is a blow-up I had made of a bubble chamber photograph.
The chamber was bombarded with high-speed particles.
Result, a photograph of a trail made by what is known as a mu meson.
But notice this hole, this gap right here.
This gap is one of the most exciting and significant recent discoveries in all science.
You probably know about it, Dr. Noymann.
Yes, yes. The formation of a temporary mesic atom, the mu meson with a hydrogen nucleus.
Right. But mu mesons are 210 times heavier than electrons.
Which means that in a mesic atom, the electrons revolve around a nucleus at just a small fraction of the ordinary distance in a normal atom.
I know you don't understand all this,
General, but stick with me.
Now, the mesic atom is extremely small, small enough to sift through the electron defenses of the ordinary atom
- and fuse with its nuclei.
- Atoms of matter or antimatter.
Right, Doc! Now if this thing of mine works and we can get close, real close, and bombard that bird's antimatter energy shield with a stream of mesic atoms,
I think we can destroy that shield.
The bird would be defenseless then except for beak, claws and wings.
You could hit it with everything but the kitchen sink.
We've got kitchen sinks to spare, son.
Do you think you can do it?
Well, I've kicked around some ideas.
I'm not sure they'll work,
- but it's certainly worth a try.
- Well, what do you need?
This lab, Dr. Noymann and his staff,
Sally here to help with the math, and a blank check for supplies and equipment.
It was yours before you finished asking for it.
MacAfee, time is running out.
Today, tomorrow, a week from now maybe...
Besides I'd hate to lose that dime
I've got invested in you. Good luck, son.
- Well, anybody ready for some work?
- Work or maybe some magic.
- What we need is a miracle!
- Here it is. A miracle.
A dime's worth of miracle.
This weapon would have to create mesic atoms, not as rare and isolated laboratory phenomena, but in tremendous quantities, eject them through some aiming and propelling device so they could travel indefinite distances through the air to arrive with sufficient speed and in sufficient numbers to bombard and destroy an antimatter shield.
Truly a miracle of science.
Especially since the scientific total life expectancy for a mesic atom, up to now, measured in laboratories, had been one two-millionth of a second.
Failure.
Failure...
...after failure...
...after failure.
And while a handful of dedicated people struggled to achieve the impossible, panic spread to all corners of the Earth.
Panic and nightmare terror.
Easy.
Mitch.
Easy, son, easy. You did your best.
We can't have you killing the patient trying to cure the disease, now, can we?
A magnificent effort, Mitch, magnificent.
It's unfortunate it was doomed to failure from the start.
Oh, great.
Now if somebody will just deliver the eulogy, the deceased can be safely laid away to rest.
What's the matter with you, are you all nuts or something?
Mitch, are you all right?
Sally, how long has it been since the explosion?
About an hour and a half, two hours, I guess.
- Oh, we're wasting time.
- Easy, son, easy.
- Is that bird still in the air?
- Why, yes.
- You still want to shoot it down?
- Why, yes, yes, sure.
Well, then, for pete's sake, let's get with it.
General Buskirk has had a plane waiting in that field outside of New York ever since we started the experiments.
We've got to get the equipment installed on that plane.
Mitch, the apparatus didn't work.
The experiments failed.
Mitch, please lie down in bed.
You were hurt in that explosion.
Of course, you don't know.
The explosion was no accident.
I did it on purpose.
I used the mesic atom projector.
What?
Well, sure. We had the basic wiring all fouled up.
It was a simple matter of adjusting the polarity on the main condenser terminals.
I figured it out while you two were asleep, set it up right and tried it.
- Now wait a minute, MacAfee.
- Mitch!
Wait a minute. Are you trying to tell me that that machine of yours works?
- Sure.
- What kind of plane has
- Buskirk got waiting for you?
- An old, stripped-down B-25.
Good. Maneuverability instead of speed.
Yeah, the whole operation may depend on being able to turn on a dime.
Well, then what in blazes are we waiting for?
Well, that's what I've been talking about for 10 minutes.
Get me my pants, will you, General?
Oh, Sally, get out of here.
We've installed the ejector nozzle in the tail of the plane,
- pointing to the back.
- Rewiring the plane's generating system, plus an added bank of batteries, should give us more than enough power.
Now, weight's a problem. How many people will you need to operate this machine?
The doctor, myself and a calculator.
Have you got someone coming up here for Sally to brief in a hurry?
- I don't want her on that plane.
- He's coming in from the city now.
One question. Why do you aim that gimmick from the tail and not from the nose?
Too dangerous in the nose. We might fly into our own mesic bombardment
- and destroy the plane.
- Chances are, once we locate the bird and we're up in the air, the bird will chase us.
- And if it doesn't?
- We'll attract its attention somehow.
- Sandwiches and coffee.
- Thank you.
The bird's been sighted heading for New York City.
- How long will it take you to finish?
- An hour and a half or two.
- Still got to connect the thing up.
- No, that's too long.
We've got to take off in 15 minutes.
You'll have to finish in the air.
What about the calculator to replace Sally?
Sorry, MacAfee, we haven't got any time for that.
- General...
- Van, you'll fly, I'll back-stop you.
- Clear the field for a takeoff.
- Right.
Well, what are we waiting for?
Get the rest of your stuff on board.
There it is now, attacking the United Nations building.
Make a pass at it.
The bird's after us, chasing us.
How are you doing?
- Ready in a minute.
- Well, fast, boy, fast.
For God's sake, hurry, man!
It's catching up with us fast.
Got it! Close those circuits.
It's all yours, General.
Steady.
Steady.
Fire rockets.
We got it.
- Now, now, don't get nasty my little friends, your bumping's not gonna hurt you one bit.
Just relax and sleep.
Sleep, sleep, sleep and in the morning you'll find yourselves in your new home.
Eh, my pets?
Good morning, Doc, what you got there?
Alvin, I found some new friends.
Listen.
Wasps?
You better be careful, they can sting a man to death.
Don't worry, we understand each other.
They know who their friend is.
They can tell.
Yeah, but they know when you ain't too.
Ah, nonsense.
If you knew about wasps what I know, you'd have no fear of them my boy.
No fear.
- Hey you, give us a hand here!
Hello there, Mr. Barker.
Surprised to see you out here in the field, sir.
How are things running at the front office?
Smooth as honey, Renfro.
I see here you turned in over a thousand pounds of orange blossom honey and 400 of beeswax last month, Renfro, congratulations, you've made the top of the list again.
Why, thank you sir.
- Holiday Honey needs your kinda man, Renfro.
You stay with it and I can see a bright future for you with the company.
Well I do try to do my best, Mr. Barker.
I try to take my inspiration from the bees, always busy, busy, busy.
Yes.
Now what about this fellow, Dr. Zinthrop?
Zinthrop?
Boy, there's a nut, him and his bees.
You know it wouldn't surprise me someday to see him flapping his arms, taking off after some queen bee with the rest of the drones.
- Mm-hmm, well he's paid to do research on royal jelly.
Haven't had a progress report from him in a month.
- Hmm, well, he has a little workshop up there, back of the orange grove, keeps a few colonies.
- I suppose I better go up there and take a look.
Hey you!
Where's this fellow Zinthrop?
- Oh, he's up where the extractor is, up there!
Hey, hey, this isn't a honey bee.
These are wasps.
Wasps!
Who's responsible for this?
Most likely Dr. Zinthrop, sir.
I told you he was a crackpot.
Zinthrop, huh?
Zinthrop.
Zinthrop!
Zinthrop!
Now look here, Zinthrop, what's all this nonsense about wasps?
I'm so glad you dropped in, Mr. Barker.
Mr. Barker, I'm on the verge of a great discovery.
Discovery, what do you mean?
- Well, sir, I almost perfected a new method of extracting royal jelly from the queen wasp.
- According to my figures you're better at extracting funds from the company.
Now look here, Zinthrop, over $1,000 last month for miscellaneous.
Yes, yes, I know, but Mr. Barker, let me just show you something.
Just let me show you something.
Already I've learned to slow the process of aging.
Soon,
I shall be able to reverse it entirely.
What are you getting at, Zinthrop?
Look, what do you see?
I see a big dog and a little dog.
Let's say an old dog and a young dog.
All right, so what?
But they're exactly the same age.
You see, the little one
Greta has been given regular injections of my compound from the queen wasp.
Just like I told ya, Mr. Barker.
- Now look here, Zinthrop,
I understand about science and progress and all that but you were attained to extract queen bee royal jelly.
Now it's a health food, a cosmetic.
It's not a miracle drug or an elixir of youth, that sort of thing is impossible.
- Oh, but Mr. Barker-
- Zinthrop,
I'm sorry, Zinthrop, but
I'm gonna have to let you go.
You just don't seem to be one of the team.
You understand.
Good luck, I'm sure you'll fit in somewhere.
Fit in.
Somewhere.
Oh, now, now, don't worry, my friends.
We shall find a home somehow.
Somewhere.
Oh but you sound impatient.
I know, it's your babies, huh?
They're hungry and they must be fed.
Now, how would you like a nice, juicy little caterpillar?
You'd like that, wouldn't you?
There.
Now you must eat and be strong because, well, a lot of work to do together.
Yes sir.
A lot of work.
As you can see, gentlemen, sales for the last fiscal quarter have dropped.
14 and one half percent.
There's not been a corresponding drop in our competitor's sales.
I trust one of you gentlemen has a satisfactory explanation for this decline.
Not one little suggestion, gentlemen?
We'll start with you, Thompson.
As Public Relations Manager, no doubt you have some faint glimmering of what's happening to Starlin Products.
Well, Thompson?
- Well, you see, I-
- I had no idea you were such an excellent public speaker, Thompson.
- Oh, I'm sorry Miss
Starlin, I guess I'm not feeling very well this morning.
I'm sorry you aren't.
- I think I can tell you why Starlin Products are falling off so badly, Miss Starlin.
We're listening, Lane.
Where would you put the responsibility for this decline?
On you, Miss Starlin.
I imagine you have arguments to support that contention?
- We've all been looking at it for the past 20 minutes.
The most convincing argument is right on that graph.
May I show you?
Thank you.
Now right here in April is when Starlin's sales started falling off.
Very clever of you, Lane.
- Would you mind waiting until I finish, Miss Starlin?
- That's enough, Lane.
- Relax, Willis.
My apologies for the interruption, go on.
Thank you.
Now as I said, sales began to fall in April.
But the reason for the fall was back here in February.
Starlin Products have always been thought of as something of a modern miracle in the cosmetics trade.
A firm built to a multi-million-dollar-a-year business on the strength and appeal of one person, Janice Starlin.
From the beginning right through until February of this year, only one woman's face was used to advertise those products.
Your face, Miss Starlin.
The public have come to accept you as a, as a symbol.
Now, after 16 years, they see a different face, they don't trust it.
They feel cheated.
The simple fact is that Starlin Cosmetics should have Janice Starlin's picture advertising them.
Well that's about all I've got to say.
And a darn good job of saying it, too.
I agree.
- Lane makes a lot of sense on that score, Miss Starlin.
I think I've had enough flattery for one morning, gentlemen.
It was a very convincing argument, Lane.
- There's a Mr.
Zinthrop to see Miss Starlin.
- There's only one small factor you've overlooked.
Not even Janice Starlin can remain a glamour girl forever.
Miss Starlin.
Yes, Mary?
There's a Mr. Zinthrop in reception, he says he has an appointment.
Thank you.
Well, this has been a very informative get together, that'll be all for now.
Oh, Arthur?
- Yes, Miss Starlin?
- I'd like to see you in my office, please.
Sure, Miss Starlin.
Take it easy, hot shot.
Something on your mind, Miss Starlin?
- You've done some work on royal jelly, haven't you?
A little.
- Are there any real therapeutic values in it?
Oh, I'd say so.
Course a lot depends on each individual's reaction to the stuff.
What do you mean?
- Just that no two people react in precisely the same way.
One man's meat's another man's poison.
Oh.
But you think royal jelly can be beneficial in some cases?
Queen bees set a lot of store by it.
- I'll accept that as an affirmative answer.
Supposing a more powerful form of royal jelly could be obtained, from the queen wasp for example.
I mean, do you suppose that might have some rejuvenating effect on a human being?
- I'd stay away from wasps if I were you, Miss Starlin.
Socially the queen wasp is on a level with the black widow spider.
They're both carnivorous, they paralyze their victims and then take their time devouring them alive.
They kill their mates in the same way too.
Strictly a one-sided romance.
Well, I'm not exactly interested in the love life of the queen wasp.
I want your opinion on the possibilities of using enzyme extracts from royal wasp jelly, commercially.
- Well, if you want an honest opinion, Miss Starlin-
Of course I want an honest opinion.
Then my advice is forget about it.
Thank you, Arthur.
Any time, Miss Starlin.
- Have Mr. Zinthrop come in.
- Yes, Miss Starlin.
You can go in now, sir.
- Oh.
'Bout time.
Janice Starlin Enterprises.
Miss Starlin?
Yes, how do you do?
I'm afraid I won't be able to give you much time,
Mr. Zinthrop.
- But it is I who give you the time, Miss Starlin.
Oh yes, plenty of time I give you, 10, maybe 15 years I give you.
- I want you to understand one thing very clearly,
Mr. Zinthrop.
I expect absolute proof of what you claimed in your letter, tangible proof, not words.
- Such proof you shall get, Madam, and more.
But I think I better show you in the laboratory, yes?
All right.
Come along.
Look.
They look terrible.
Why don't you put them out of their misery?
- Madam, you asked for proof, please be kind enough to look at the proof you asked for.
May I proceed?
Thank you.
Come, come, come little one.
In a few minutes, Madam, we shall see a miracle you shall not believe.
Oh, no tricks, you may look if you like, I have no tricks.
Well, don't look at me, I'm not changing.
I don't believe it, it's not possible.
I see you do not believe one animal, so I bring two.
I show you again, yes?
Yes, I must be sure.
Yes, Madam.
There.
Well, Miss Starlin, does my secret have interest for you, yes?
What are your terms, Mr. Zinthrop?
First, I must have a laboratory equipped with everything I need for my research.
If we're successful, well, I ask for a little percentage.
But I must get full credit for my discovery, that is most important to me.
I'll have Gordon draw up the contracts.
Oh, contracts, contracts I do not need, you give me your word, good enough for me.
You amaze me.
Frankly, when I received your letter I thought you were just another eccentric.
But there was always a chance you might not be.
Then you walk in here and show me nothing short of a miracle.
Two miracles.
And you say that you'll accept my word that I won't cheat you.
You won't.
I know you're a good woman, even if you do not like other people to know it.
However, my formula may not be good for human beings,
I have not tested yet.
You will, on me.
- Oh, no, no, no, no, there might be danger.
Those are my terms, Mr. Zinthrop.
Janice Starlin will be your next guinea pig.
Very well.
Though it may take a little time to prepare a sufficient extract, a week, maybe more.
- I'll make whatever arrangements you may need for your equipment.
Thank you, Madam.
Now I see how you built all this.
- I'm very close to losing it, Mr. Zinthrop.
Maybe working together we can save
Janice Starlin Enterprises, maybe even make it bigger than ever before.
Yes.
Oh, yes.
- I'm sure the next three months we will see a rise in Starlin sales that will surpass anything we've dared imagine.
Mr. Zinthrop...
Is working on the final stages of a development that will revolutionize the cosmetics industry.
He's to have a free hand in his experiments and will be answerable to no one but myself.
At the moment I cannot divulge the nature of Mr. Zinthrop's experiments but I can assure you it will bring world-wide recognition to Janice Starlin Enterprises.
- I dunno, this Zinthrop must be the granddaddy of all confidence men to have taken a gal like Starlin.
Now why doesn't somebody wise her up?
Like you, for instance?
Bill, what makes you think Zinthrop really isn't on the level?
After all, we don't even know what he's working on, it could be very legitimate.
You're as bad as she is.
Oh, women.
Men.
Every time you're stuck for an answer you always come up with, "Women."
You're not getting out of this one so easily.
I'd like to know why you think Zinthrop really hasn't got something.
- Well you can call it male intuition if you like.
It's just that there's something about this whole business that doesn't smell right.
The private laboratory, the secret experiments,
Zinthrop himself.
The only thing that's missing is a genie with a lamp.
You better leave the intuition to me.
Come on, I'll let you buy me dinner.
Buy you dinner?
What's happened to your sporting blood?
I thought we were gonna toss for the check.
Oh no, you won the last three times.
- All right, look, I'll make a deal with you.
Dinner is on me if you promise to keep an eye on what goes on in there.
- Oh, what do you want me to do, read her mail and send you messages in secret code?
You could do worse.
Oh no, Mr. Cooper, not you too.
- I've been trying to tell bright eyes here that I think Zinthrop is a phony and a confidence man.
- If I were sure of that
I wouldn't be worried.
I think he's a lot more dangerous.
A quack.
Well, I don't follow you, Coop.
Well, a confidence man would just be interested in your money.
The only damage they can do is to your pocket book.
A quack can be fatal.
- So I says to him, I says, "Listen Irving,
"I'm getting sick of this
TV every night, I mean,
"you know, we can do the same thing in a night club."
Well, almost.
Good morning, Janice Starlin Enterprises.
I got two words for ya, drop dead.
Twice.
Irving?
Calls me to tell me Dr. Cyclops is on channel nine tonight.
What a crust.
He's seen it twice already.
Good morning.
Is Miss Starlin in her office now?
Miss Starlin's in conference.
Would you like to speak to her secretary?
Oh, no, no, no, just say to Miss Starlin
I should like to see her when she has time, huh?
Yes sir.
Was there something else, Mr. Zinthrop?
No, no, no, no, goodbye.
Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
What a character, a regular two-eyed Dr. Cyclops.
Even the bow.
- "Good morning, may I see Miss Zarlin, please?"
He's a real weirdy.
Wonder what his game is.
- Who cares.
You know, Morton thinks he's a crackpot,
I heard him telling Cooper so.
Old bug eyes really has the execs worried.
About what?
That's just it, they don't know.
Oh.
So anyway, back to Irving.
- Good morning, Miss
Starlin, good morning.
- Good morning, I couldn't get away any sooner, is it important?
- Miss Starlin, do you remember the big cat
I showed you last week, no?
What about it?
Well, I want you to look at him, come.
No.
Quite a difference, yes?
Why, it's incredible!
The same mark.
Same cat.
- You're young again, can you realize what that means?
You're a kitten again.
Your whole life to live over.
How does it feel?
- I think perhaps you'll be able to find out for yourself, Miss Starlin.
Today...
Today will be your first injection.
Come.
Sit down, please.
- Mr. Gleason, of accounting, on line three.
What is it, Gleason?
I sent you a memo.
Mr. Zinthrop has carte Blanche to order anything he requires.
It is no concern of yours, Gleason.
Make out a check for the full amount.
Sue?
Mary.
Can I talk to Mr. Lane a minute, please?
Bill?
Hey, listen, Gleason just got a bill for $2,300.
Zinthrop.
Enzyme extracts.
Yes, yes, yes, we are making progress, there's great improvement in the tissue.
Why is it taking so long?
It's the third week.
You forget, my dear, there's more to you than a little kitten, no?
Besides, there's a difference in metabolism.
Why not increase the dosage?
Wouldn't that step up the process?
Patience, my dear, patience.
We must tread lightly, with care, your arm, please.
There.
You know, I've been experimenting with a concentrated solution of the enzymes, oh a great deal more powerful than the solution
I've been using in your injection.
Oh?
Yes.
And I think, I think it will be better for lotions, as an emollient lotion it'll make estrogenic creams and all such products old fashioned.
My dear, Starlin will be world famous, bringing you to millions.
If you're right, Zinthrop, there are going to be a few red faces in my advertising department.
But I am right, why your own mirror will tell you that I am right.
Why, you look at least five years younger than you looked three weeks ago.
I know.
- Will you let me talk to Bill a minute, Sue?
Thanks.
Bill, I think I've got it.
Yeah, I'm a nervous wreck.
At lunch, at lunch.
You'll have to translate for me, Coop,
I'm not very good at that technical stuff.
Pseudo-technical.
Our Mr. Zinthrop's a very capable confidence man from what I read in this letter.
He claims he can stimulate the processes of rejuvenation through the use of enzymes extracted from wasps.
Oh, for...
- Well, what are you two
Sherlocks going to do about it?
Right now I don't know.
- Frankly I'm getting tired of the whole business.
That woman's so intent on holding back time she's ready to fall for the first phony line she hears.
Wasps.
Bill.
Face the facts, Mary, Janice Starlin has built her whole life on youth and beauty.
Now that she's losing them she's scared to death.
Right now she's on cloud nine with that quack Zinthrop but I'd hate to be around when she comes back down to Earth.
Well maybe we can let her down easy.
I think we owe her that much.
Yeah.
What are we gonna do?
We can't just let Zinthrop build up her hopes and then knock the props out from under her.
How can he do such a terrible thing?
Poor Jan.
There must be something we can do before it's too late.
He's got a mighty convincing argument.
Very impressive to the layman.
10 to one he's got a record just as impressive.
There are ways to find out.
The answer might be right here in our hands.
Heads.
I'm gonna keep this letter for a day or two.
- Wait a minute, suppose she finds out it's gone,
I'm the only one with access to that desk, she'll know I took it.
That's a chance you have to take, Mary.
I think we can be pretty sure that Coop knows what he's doing, honey.
Well come on, young lovers.
What is it, Maureen?
It is you, Miss Starlin?
Of course it's me.
Who did you think it was?
You look so different.
Finish your nails.
Maureen.
Hmm?
I think your phone is ringing.
Oh, yes, Miss Starlin.
Good morning, Janice Starlin Enterprises.
Gentlemen, Janice Starlin Enterprises is about to start on the most wide-spread publicity campaign in the history of the cosmetic industry.
Our slogan will be, "Return to youth with Janice Starlin."
When Mr. Zinthrop arrives, there will be a press interview and all questions regarding the rejuvenation process will be referred to him.
That'll be all for now, gentlemen.
- It's amazing.
- Why, it's wonderful.
- Absolutely amazing.
- You look marvelous.
- I said that will be all for now, gentlemen.
Good morning.
Oh not you, Mary, wait a moment, please.
Yes, Miss Starlin?
Mary, isn't it wonderful?
It's a miracle, a wonderful, incredible miracle!
We were so worried about you, we really thought you were in danger.
We even went to plotting how to rescue you from Mr. Zinthrop.
It all seems so silly, it seems ridiculous.
Oh Mary,
Mary, how old do I look?
Tell me, how old?
How old do I look?
Tell me!
How old?
Maybe 22?
That's how old I was when I started
Janice Starlin Enterprises.
Do you realize what that means?
I'm back where I started, 18 years ago, with what it took 18 years to accomplish.
It's like a dream.
- 30 years ago a bunch of quacks were treating people with monkey glands.
Seemed to work for a while.
Then the deterioration set in.
That's awful.
Do you think that will happen to Jan?
I don't know.
If I could just get inside of his lab and run a breakdown on what he's using.
Mr. Zinthrop!
Mr. Zinthrop?
Mr. Zinthrop?
I want you to find him, Mr. Hellman,
I don't care what it costs.
We'll find him all right, sooner or later we find them all.
Time is vital, Mr. Hellman.
Every hour he's gone, it means more than you can possibly imagine.
- Well, you haven't given me very much to go on.
No home address, no former employer, no phone, this is just like starting from scratch.
Mr. Zinthrop wasn't a, a conventional employee.
He didn't go through regular personnel.
Uh-huh.
You say he came here about a month ago, well how did he come here, Miss Starlin?
He just didn't walk in off the street, did he?
The letter.
Right here in my drawer.
- Maybe one of the other drawers?
So that's what she meant?
What who meant?
Miss Starlin?
The letter's been taken and you think you know who took it, is that right?
My secretary, Miss Dennison.
You got her address handy?
Her phone number.
- It might be better if
I busted in on her cold.
This way she'll have a chance to prepare a story.
I know what I'm doing.
All right.
Mary?
Janice Starlin.
- Before I went to lunch
I made a duplicate copy of Mr. Zinthrop's letter.
I was going to take that one to Bill and Mr. Cooper at first but then I thought that the original would be better.
Have you got the copy?
Yes, it's in my desk.
Get that copy, Miss Dennison.
Uh-huh, 946 West 73rd Street, Manhattan.
Yeah, that's right, get right on it, Jerry and check back with me as soon as you can.
Yeah?
Oh?
You're sure he's our boy?
Uh-huh.
Is he?
Central emergency.
Mm-hmm.
Right.
Well, it looks like we've got him.
There's a John Doe down at central emergency, auto accident.
There's no identification on him but he was wearing a lab smock and fills
Zinthrop's description.
- Mary, get my coat and
Lane, get a cab downstairs.
Is he badly hurt?
- Head injury, general contusion to the body.
- He's had a severe injury and there's definite brain damage, just how much we can't tell as yet.
How long before you'll know?
It's hard to say, Miss Starlin.
- Who's the best man for this kind of injury?
Well, there's several top specialists.
Get the best,
I'll take full responsibility for the expenses.
Yes, Miss Starlin.
I don't know, Arthur.
I think it best we wait.
- It's been three days since the accident, Jan, and no sign of improvement, he's still in a coma.
You heard what the doctor said.
He may never regain consciousness.
And even if he does, who knows how badly his brain has been damaged.
Well,
I'll give it another 48 hours.
If he doesn't regain consciousness by then, you can take over the laboratory, Arthur.
Janice.
It's my decision.
- It's incredible, right in front of our noses.
He can't have used it all.
I could run a qualitative analysis.
- Confounded thing, always goes on the fritz right in the middle of a good program.
- I want this to be the biggest advertising campaign in the history of cosmetic advertising.
Every newspaper and magazine in the country will be flooded with our new slogan,
"Return to youth with Janice Starlin."
Excuse me, Miss Starlin.
What is it, Thompson?
- I think we should be a little conservative,
Miss Starlin, cosmetics are one thing, medications another, we're liable to run into trouble.
Yes.
All advertising copy will be cleared through your office.
It's a touchy business, you know?
Max is right, Miss Starlin.
- You don't have to second the motion, Lane.
I want one thing understood very clearly now, gentlemen.
Janice Starlin Enterprises is going to bring the most fantastically sellable product ever developed by modern cosmetics to the public.
And I don't intend to be restricted by timidity on the part of my own staff, is that clear?
Are you all right, Miss Starlin?
It's just a little headache, Mary.
I'm fine.
Can I get you something?
I'm all right, I'm all right, thank you.
I have some Aspirin in my purse.
It's all right, Mary.
Well, that'll be all for now, gentlemen.
Hi.
Hi, sweetie.
- Gee, I sure hope they give the girls working at Starlin first crack at that new stuff.
Imagine being 18 again.
- I guess if it can take
15 years off Starlin, it can take 10 off you.
What do you mean 10?
- Face it honey, this is
Maureen you're talking to.
Yeah?
Well if I were you I'd take a double dose then maybe Irving wouldn't watch television so much.
So who says he looks at it?
I can't imagine what else he does.
Three guesses.
- Say, did Cooper come in yet?
- Uh-uh.
Missed a board meeting this morning,
I bet Starlin's having a fit.
He should worry.
Uh-oh, see you later.
Bye, honey.
Hi pretty puss.
You know where
Miss Starlin's office is?
Suite number one.
- I. Di da, the Duchess of Flatbush herself.
- How'd you like to have this phone wrapped around your ear?
Wise guy.
That's more like it, sister.
Suite number one.
Thank you.
Miss Starlin.
Oh, what is it, Mary?
Is there anything I can do?
Yes, is Mr. Zinthrop's room ready?
- Uh-huh, the nurse is fixing the emergency equipment now and the ambulance is due any minute.
Be sure to let me know when it arrives.
Oh, Mary, please, before you go, could you see if you could work that thing?
Oh, sure.
I've seen lots of these.
Oh, simple enough.
That'll be all, Mary, thank you.
All right.
- We've had a room especially made over for you,
Mr. Zinthrop and Mrs. Warren has a room adjoining yours so there'll be someone near you at all times.
Thank you, thank you.
- When you're feeling better, Mr. Zinthrop, there are a few things I'd like to discuss with you.
Good, good.
We'll do everything we can to make you comfortable, Mr. Zinthrop.
I'm going to spend the nights here in my office so if anything develops, I'll be on hand.
Thank you.
Thank you, Miss Starlin.
Only there's something
I must tell you, something important.
But, important but...
I cannot remember.
I'm sure it can wait.
Right now the main thing is to get you back to health.
Take good care of him, Mrs. Warren.
Yes, Miss Starlin.
Sure is funny about old Coop.
- He misses one day of work and you're ready to call missing persons.
- Well, he's a pretty conscientious guy, honey, if he felt sick or something he'd have called in.
Relax, he'll probably be in bright and chipper in the morning.
Oh, am I interrupting something?
- Oh, we were just having a little coffee class,
Miss Starlin, we were talking about Mr. Cooper.
What about Mr. Cooper?
- Well, about his missing the meeting this morning.
Nobody's been able to reach him all day.
I wouldn't worry about that,
Mr. Cooper's been here a long time.
Probably feels he's entitled to take a day for himself now and then.
- That's what I've been trying to tell Mr. Lane.
- Oh, by the way, Miss
Starlin, how is Mr. Zinthrop?
Oh, fine.
In a few days we'll start the layouts for the campaign.
I'm ready when you are, boss.
Look those over.
Hey, Bill.
Hmm?
- Don't go getting any ideas about the boss.
- Me? Don't be silly,
I just want her to know that I'm an eager member of the team.
Still, she is looking a lot younger these days, isn't she?
You think Zinthrop would give you any of those treatments?
Break the watch or something.
Guarantee on this too.
What's that?
Lie back now, you just had a bad dream.
Lie down now, go to sleep.
This horrible sound.
Like a nightmare.
Just a bad dream.
Lie down.
Just a dream.
- Tell Mr. Green that personnel is his responsibility.
I have other things to think about than worrying whether the night watchman walked off the job.
Well that's just it, Miss Starlin,
Mr. Green feels that the watchman never left the building.
His lunch pail and his raincoat are still in the basement.
- I don't want to hear anything more about it, Mary.
All right, Miss Starlin.
We'll use these.
Fine.
She swears she heard a scream from one of the other floors.
Zinthrop heard it too but she convinced him he was having a bad dream.
Oh, maybe they both were.
It's not funny any more, Mary, there's something going on in that building.
And I'm gonna find out what it is.
How?
- Have a look around
Cooper's lab, for one thing.
After that I,
I don't know.
Hold it steady.
Bill, this is crazy.
We could really get in trouble.
I won't tire him, Mrs. Warren but it is important.
- All right, Miss Starlin,
I'll be in my room.
Zinthrop,
Zinthrop, you've got to help me.
Something's happening.
Something's happening to me, I can't control it.
There's something I must remember but
I can't.
Try to think.
The wasp enzymes, the extracts you were experimenting with before the accident.
Try to think!
I can't
Well this is Zinthrop's notebook, Mary.
Notes on his experiments with Jan.
Well how did Cooper get hold of it?
I don't know.
If only Coop would show up.
Mary, look.
It's Mr. Cooper's pipe.
Don't you get it?
He'd sooner go out without his pants than leave that pipe behind.
He's still somewhere in the building,
I'd bet a year's salary on it.
- If he is-
- He's dead.
And the night watchman.
- There's only enough left for one more injection.
One more.
You've got to make more, Zinthrop.
Help me, Zinthrop!
Please, leave, my head, oh my head.
Zinthrop, help me!
Help me!
Is he asleep?
I don't know.
Bill, don't touch him.
- If anybody knows what's behind all this, it's him.
Mr. Zinthrop?
Bill.
Look it.
- Well, her coat, purse and everything else is still in there.
She wouldn't go out without her purse.
- Bill, let's get out of here, I don't like it.
The cat...
The cat...
Must warn her.
Mr. Zinthrop!
Who are you?
- Now there's nothing to be alarmed about, Mr. Zinthrop,
I'm Bill Lane and this is Miss Dennison,
Miss Starlin's secretary.
Miss Starlin, the cat.
What about a cat?
Must warn her.
The injections, must not take any more injections.
Is Miss Starlin in danger?
Terrible danger.
I must-
- Take it easy, Mr. Zinthrop, you're still pretty weak.
Mary, see if you can get Jan on the phone.
There's no answer.
- Oh, Miss Starlin?
- Is that you, Mary?
- Where are you?
- We're in the building.
We're in Mr. Zinthrop's room.
Something's happened down here-
Here, let me talk to her.
Hello, Miss Starlin, this is Lane.
- Why are you and Mary still in the building?
It's after 10.
- I must help,
I'm responsible.
- Don't let him get up, Mary.
I must help.
I must-
- I can't explain now, Miss Starlin.
I must go.
- Hang on to him.
- I must help.
You must not hold me back.
Don't worry, Mr. Zinthrop, we won't let anything happen to Miss Starlin.
Hello, hello, Miss Starlin.
What's going on down there?
Stay in your office, I'll be right up.
Keep an eye on Zinthrop, honey, I'm going upstairs.
No, no, no!
The insect, the insect!
Take it easy, Mr. Zinthrop.
You do not understand, Miss Starlin, she's in danger, I must warn.
- Look, I'll have to stay here, you go for Jan.
Okay.
When you get up there, call the police, you can't get outside on this phone.
All right, all right, I'll hurry.
Not the police, not the police.
Miss Starlin!
Miss Starlin, it's me, Mary!
Miss Starlin, please, open the door!
- What is it, Mary?
- Miss Starlin, please!
Will you please call the police?
What for?
Look, I don't have time to, never mind.
Mary!
I'm sorry I had to do that.
There's no time for hysteria.
Now what is this?
- The enzymes, the enzymes, they're going crazy.
Sure, Mr. Zinthrop, you just relax and take it easy, everything'll be all right, we'll take care of those whatever you call those-
- You do not understand, you do not understand, that girl, you shouldn't have sent her upstairs.
She's in danger, you must stop her before it is too late.
- Okay.
As soon as the cops get here, we'll take-
Oh, you fool, you fool.
Miss Starlin will kill her and tear her body to shreds.
Miss Starlin kill Mary?
- Miss Starlin is not a human being any longer.
The enzymes have changed her.
She will destroy the girl as an evil wasp would destroy her enemies.
And then devour the remains.
- Then Bill found Mr. Zinthrop's notebook in Cooper's desk.
No, no, there's no mistake, we've got to call the police now.
- Now, Mary, you're just getting a little excited.
Now who could possibly want to hurt Mr. Coop...
I don't know.
But it's not only Mr. Cooper.
What about...
I told you, we're too late.
Mary!
Mary!
Wait, I'll go with you.
I can't wait, I'm gonna take the stairs.
Oh look.
Laboratory, she's going to the laboratory.
Going up the stairs.
Mary!
Mary, Mary!
Help!
Get away from her!
Mary.
Oh, Mary.
NARRATOR: In the beginning, God created the heaven and the Earth.
And the Earth was without form, and void.
This is the planet Earth, newly born, and cooling rapidly from a temperature of 6,000 degrees to a few hundred in less than five billion years.
The heat rises, meets the atmosphere, the clouds form, and rain pours down upon the hardening surface for countless centuries.
The restless seas rise, find boundaries, are contained.
Now, in their warm depths, the miracle of life begins.
In infinite variety, living things appear, and change, and reach the land, leaving a record of their coming, of their struggle to survive, and of their eventual end.
The record of life is written on the land, where 15 million years later, in the upper reaches of the Amazon, man is still trying to read it.
MAN: Tomas! Tomas! Tomas!
Please.
LUIS: What that is,
Dr. Maia?
I don't know, Luis.
I have never seen anything like this before.
It's important?
Yes, I think it is, very important.
We will take one more picture.
Then we will dig it out.
Luis, I'm going to Morajo
Bay, to the institute.
You two are to wait here in the camp.
You be gone long?
Long enough to find out what this is and get help in digging out the rest of the skeleton.
I want a man in camp at all times.
Luis, you will be in charge.
I'm sure you scared all the fish away.
At the depths he's working, Doctor, the fish won't hear a thing, believe me.
Ah. There he is.
See him?
What's he waiting for?
He's getting used to the change in pressure.
KAY: Ah. Here he comes.
DAVID: Hi.
David. David, I have a surprise for you.
Yeah?
Carl Maia!
It isn't you!
What's left of me,
Dr. David Reed.
The last I heard of you, you were up in the Amazon someplace digging for old skeletons and things.
And you two were doing research for an aquarium in California.
What are you doing in Brazil?
On, we've been guests at your institute for a month now.
We're looking for specimens of lungfish.
David, you still don't look like an ichthyologist. (ALL CHUCKLING)
A geologist's point of view.
He expected a loveable old professor with a beard.
I didn't expect him to look like he did when he was a student of mine.
Give me a shoulder, Kay.
Are you two married yet?
No. No, David says we're together all the time anyway, might as well save expenses.
Did you ever hear of two living as cheaply as one?
That's what I keep telling him, Carl.
I'm waiting for Williams to give her that raise.
Then she can afford me.
Oh!
Come on. Let's go ashore. it's good to see you again, Carl.
Show him what brought you back, Carl.
I found this in a limestone deposit dating back to the Devonian age.
I was hoping you experts on marine life could make some identification.
DAVID: I've never seen anything like this.
KAY: Look at the webbing between the fingers, David.
DAVID: Yeah.
Maybe we'll know more about it after
I find the rest of the skeleton.
Boy, I'd sure like to be with you when you do.
So would I.
What about your boss?
You think he would be interested?
Williams? (CHUCKLES)
If there's a chance of any publicity, just try and keep him away.
Now, be fair, David.
Publicity brings endowments.
And without money, there isn't any research.
That's right, if it weren't for Dr.
Williams going on digging up the dough, we wouldn't be down here.
Where is this thing?
At the institute.
DR. MAIA: Here it is, gentlemen.
Exactly as I found it.
It's amazing. it's incredible!
MARK: Could it possibly belong to a Pleistocene man?
Chances are much greater that that hand belonged to an amphibian, Mark, one that spent a great deal of time in the water.
Well, then now do you account for the structure of the fingers, obviously for land use?
What do you think, Dr. Matos?
We can be sure of one thing.
Whatever it was, it was very powerful.
You say you have hopes of finding the rest of the fossil?
As soon as I get a suitable expedition together.
Well, why don't we make up the expedition?
We're here now, and after all, it does come under the heading of our work, doesn't it, David?
It certainly does.
More and more, we're learning the meaning and the value of marine research.
Look, look over here.
This lungfish, the bridge between fish and the land animal.
How many thousands of ways nature tried to get life out of the sea and onto the land.
This one failed.
He hasn't changed in millions of years.
But here, here we have a clue to an answer.
Someday, spaceships will be traveling from Earth to other planets.
How are human beings going to survive on those planets?
The atmosphere will be different, the pressures will be different.
By studying these and other species, we add to our knowledge of how life evolved, how it adapted itself to this world.
With that knowledge, perhaps we can teach men to adapt themselves to some new world of the future.
Nice speech, David, but there's still a practical side to it.
If I sound brash and more like a banker than a scientist, try to remember that it takes money to run an institute like ours.
A find of any real importance can be of great financial value to us also.
Certainly, your board couldnâ€™t disapprove.
It certainly couldn't.
Dr. Maia, you've got yourself an expedition.
Good, we'll leave for
Manaus in the morning.
From there, we'll take a boat up river.
Tomas!
No,no,no! it's so hot.
It'll get hotter.
Couldn't Maia find anything better than this barge?
Well, I guess not many ships want to go up river as far as we're going.
We didn't exactly expect to get the Ile de France either.
You don't like the Rita?
What the doctor meant, Lucas...
I know what the doctor means.
But what for I need a sweet-smelling boat to carry fish on this crazy river?
How do you like the best cabin on the Rita, Miss Lawrence?
I love it!
Good.
Well, now we have a lab, such as it is.
Let's hope we have some use for it.
I'll be disappointed if we don't.
Assuming, of course, that Dr.
Maia's facts are well-founded.
Dr. Maia's a scientist, not a fortuneteller
How can he guarantee anything?
Well, it seems to me, a scientist has need for both vision and confidence.
I didn't mean it as any personal criticism, Doctor.
It's just that I always look forward to success.
And I thought the
Mississippi was something.
It's a winding brook compared to the Amazon.
This is exactly as it was
150 million years ago when it was part of the Devonian era.
Sounds like the beginning of the world.
It is.
Even the animals here grow as they did in Devonian forests.
The anteater is a giant with the strength of a bear.
The centipede grows to be a foot long.
The Amazonian rat is as big as a sheep.
That's incredible.
But it's true.
Don't forget our catfish.
They grow to be nine feet long, and killers!
Like everything in this jungle, all killers.
Dr. Maia says we're gonna drop anchor in a couple of hours.
Maybe you'd better get some rest.
Again, Lucas.
We want to make sure my boys hear us at camp.
When we anchor, we'll take a rowboat.
Luis!
Tomas!
Luis!
Luis! Tomas!
Strange they'd be gone.
Could they have gone hunting?
I gave strict orders for one man to remain in camp at all times.
Come on!
Stay here, Kay.
Wait till we find out what's going on.
Luis!
What could have happened?
I don't understand it.
Thereâ€™s only one explanation.
The country is full of wild animals.
I think maybe jaguar.
Jaguar's claws, they rip like this.
Where's Kay? Kay?
Kay!
What happened?
There's been trouble.
Let's go back on board, Kay.
A world-shaking find, all right.
(GROANS) Eight days.
All we dig up are enough stones to pave a road.
Had enough, Mark, or do we keep on digging?
I'll tell you when
I've had enough.
We've failed, that's all people will understand.
Carl, have you any idea what this tributary empties into?
My boys used to tell me there's a lagoon at the end of it.
What are you getting at?
I was just thinking.
It could be that at some time in the past, part of this bank broke away and fell into the river here.
Over hundreds of years, perhaps over thousands of years, the current would break it up.
If there is a dead end to this tributary, that's where we'll find the fragments.
We might even find the rest of your fossil.
It's a theory.
What's wrong with that?
Even if David's theory is correct, the chances of finding anything are remote.
Science is always taking the remote chance.
Why don't we try it?
We might still turn failure into success.
Well, there's just one thing, Mark, going into unexplored territory with a woman.
I'm not afraid, David, and we've come this far.
Yeah, I know, but I keep remembering what happened to Carl's men.
That doesn't sound like the dedicated scientist talking, David.
Dedication doesn't mean risking the lives of others.
I've always found Kay was able to take care of herself.
But we know nothing about this lagoon.
I can tell you something about this place.
My boys call it the "Black
Lagoon," a paradise.
(CHUCKLES) Only, they say nobody has ever come back to prove it.
We'll do it.
(GASPS) om
Oh, David.
(CHUCKLES) I didn't mean to startle you.
I don't know what made me do that.
That howling out there doesn't help any.
Those are guariba monkeys.
You sorry now that we came?
You don't understand the species very well, Doctor.
Well, give me time.
I thought I was doing well, considering that we've only been together for six months.
How much time do you think you'll need?
From where I'm sitting,
I'd say a lifetime.
That's the right answer.
We may not even have a lifetime.
In that case...
You mean this thing really works?
Oh, yes.
It's a very positive weapon, the spear gun, Lucas, and easy to use.
All you do is aim it and squeeze.
What are you going to shoot at?
Does it make any difference?
DAVID: Can you take it any slower?
Ease her off.
Little bit, not too much.
Give me that boat hook.
I think we can just make it on this side.
It's tight over here.
It's impossible.
But I, Lucas, will do it.
DAVID: The Black Lagoon.
KAY: The beautiful lagoon.
DR. THOMPSON: Another world.
Take her out a little farther, then we'll get the net over the side.
You expect to catch a fish?
We might as well find out what species are here.
We're not interested in what species of fish are here.
We're after the rest of that fossil, remember?
I need some rocks from the bottom of the lagoon for a test.
But we just got here.
Why waste time?
If any parts of the wall that contained the fossil were ever deposited in here, the rock test should prove it.
Yeah.
I'll get the Aqua-Lungs.
You be careful, David.
We don't know what's down there.
I hope you're afraid for me too, Kay.
Of course, Mark.
A little faster.
Come on! Faster!
All right, let her down.
All the way.
Come on, down, down.
All the way.
All right. Hold it!
Here we go.
We got the net down, David.
Good.
This is crazy kind of fishing.
Who eats rocks?
I do, in a manner of speaking.
I crush them and they tell me things.
Now, you be careful.
What these rocks tell you, anyway?
How old they are.
It's called the uranium-lead test.
What do you wanna know that for?
So we can match them against the sample in which the fossil was found.
KAY: Hey, they're up!
How long they have to wait there?
It depends on how far down they went.
Well, how was it down there, huh?
Oh, fine.
Come on, I'll help you off with this equipment.
MARK: Good.
DAVID: Carl,
I got your samples.
Good.
Let me have them.
Here they are.
Thank you, David.
And this is something for you.
Oh! Well, thank you.
They're very pretty.
Let's test them right away.
DR. MAIA: Will you help me, Doctor?
DR. THOMPSON: Be glad to.
DR. MAIA Thank you.
Come on, David.
You can play house later.
David. About Mark.
Well, what about him?
Try to understand.
I've been trying.
Somebody ought to tell him his ambition is showing.
It won't do any good, I know.
Long before you came to work with us, I tried.
But there's this to say for him, he's produced some important findings.
He's also taken credit for some important findings.
Well, coming below?
No. No, I'll wait up here.
Hey, what was it like down there?
Like another world.
I'd like to see it.
Crazy kind of fishing, for rocks! (CHUCKLING)
Miss Lawrence!
Miss Lawrence!
You're too far out,
Miss Lawrence!
Hey,Zee!
Go start the motor!
Chico! Pull up the anchor!
DAVID: Kay, what are you doing out there?
Come on back!
LUCAS: You take it easy.
We get you!
Drop the anchor.
KAY: Thanks, Lucas.
Kay, that wasn't a very smart thing to do.
KAY; But wonderful!
What was that?
Something's in the net.
Pull up your net!
Come on. Hurry up!
Take it away!
DAVID: Pull it up!
Pull it up!
Is it fouled against the side?
DAVID: Pull it up!
The boom's cracking!
Slack off your winch!
Slack off!
He can't hear you!
Hey, what kind of fish do this?
Who says it was a fish?
The net could've hooked on to some underwater rock.
Wait a minute.
It was no rock that left this in the net.
It's amazing!
I just finished the rock analysis.
And you were right, David.
Some of the limestone deposit where I found the fossil is on the bottom of this lagoon.
Lucas, put that over the side for me, will you?
Whatever the species might be, if you let it alone, it won't bother you.
Maybe. But if you're wrong, this harpoon will correct any mistakes.
Mark, we're out for photographs for study, not trophies.
This thing alive and in its natural habitat, it's valuable to us.
Why settle for a photo when we can get the real thing?
You don't sound like a scientist.
You sound like some big-game hunter out for the kill.
We may not be back home, David, but you're still working for me.
You didn't wait long enough before coming up.
Why'd you shoot?
You weren't attacked!
You sound as though I put the harpoon through you.
What makes you think we're supposed to play tag with the thing, whatever it is?
I tell you, we can learn more from it if it's alive!
Please, what is it that you found?
I don't know what you'd call it.
It sounds incredible, but it appeared to be human.
I tell you, if it's what I think I saw, it's the greatest find yet.
Nothing compares to it.
I've got the proof here in my lens.
LUCAS: Many years ago, I hear this legend on the river.
A very old native tell me of a man who live underwater, but she was crazy.
"Crazy Goole," everybody called her.
The unknown always seems unbelievable, Lucas.
One accepts these things as legend and lets it go at that, but to actually believe that there exists something like a human being that can live underwater...
This is no legend, as you'll soon see for yourself.
What about the kamongo?
Science hadn't heard about it until a few years ago.
The kamongo lived way back in the Devonian age.
Interesting that the fossil I found was out of the same period.
The kamongo was a fish that breathed air.
What does that prove?
KAY: Nothing.
Except that the kamongo fish, which has lungs, exists today, right here in the Amazon.
It hasn't changed in all these millions of years.
That doesn't prove the possibility of a gillman.
If the evolution of that species could reach a dead end way back then and still survive, why couldn't another?
DR. THOMPSON: Where is he?
I was sure I had him in my finder.
For a merman, he takes a fine picture.
This wasn't imagination, Doctor.
I'm sorry, David.
What proof do we have if we never find it again?
If you hadn't stopped me, we could have taken it!
Dead or alive, what's the difference?
Ahhh!
What happened?
ZEE: Chico!
What happened?
Chico!
Chico is gone.
My brother was dragged down into the water by a demon!
Come on, everybody, look around, quick!
Chico!
Demon, eh?
It's no more far-fetched than your gillman.
There are many strange legends in the Amazon.
Even I, Lucas, have heard the legend of a man-fish.
DR. MAIA: Over here! Quickly!
LOOK!
All right, Lucas, start your pumps.
Now all we have to do is catch him.
Don't waste your time.
You'll never take it alive.
I want to try, Mark.
All right, David, we can always do it my way.
If we could just be sure of its reaction.
Do you suppose it remembers
Mark's attack and seeks revenge?
I'll welcome it.
You'll get your wish, all right.
I've got a hunch this creature remembers the past and more.
I don't want him creeping up on us while we're sleeping.
I know a way to bring him up now.
Rotenone.
It's a drug which natives make from roots for catching fish in still waters.
Sometimes I catch fish that way.
I show you. Look.
Excuse.
One taste of the poison water, and poof!
The paralyzed fish floats up to the top with a big hangover.
Come on! Let's try it.
Still no sign.
Nothing but the little ones so far.
Could be he's dead from the wound.
Then again, maybe the rotenone isn't going deep enough.
Maybe we should fix the rotenone to sink deeper down.
Yeah. Anything is worth a try.
What was that?
I don't know.
Come on. Come on.
You talking to me, Mark, or something out there?
Both, David.
They won't believe it back home, none of them.
I wouldn't have believed it myself.
Sitting out here, waiting for some monster to appear.
That's why we've got to take him.
Why won't they believe, Mark?
Because we deal with known quantities, with knowledge we've accumulated up to now.
We've just begun to learn about the water and its secrets, just as we've only touched on outer space.
We don't entirely rule out the possibility that there might be some form of life on another planet.
Then why not some entirely different form of life in a world we already know is inhabited by millions of living creatures?
We must have the proof!
In the water!
The lantern frightened him off.
No.
There he is! it's foolish to go after him.
But he's drugged.
No, I'd wait anyway.
If he has gills, he may suffocate
How long does the effect last?
An hour, maybe two.
But for that thing, who can tell?
Carl, follow me in a rowboat.
Bring a net.
Wait, I'm going along with you.
I keep you covered.
That's where he went under.
I'm going to take a look.
Wait here.
Take it easy!
He went through here, come on.
Zee! oh, David! David!
We got him!
We got him!
Don't kill him!
What happened?
Give me the net.
How is he?
He's dead.
DAVID:
That's the last one.
All right.
Will he live?
I don't know.
It depends on whether he can survive both the rotenone and being out of the water so long.
You sound as if you feel sorry for him.
Why? He could have killed you just as easily.
But he didn't.
It doesn't make any difference now.
The point is, he won't do any more killing.
Any time you're ready,
Lucas, we can start back.
Mark, we're not finished here yet.
We've got to make a study of that grotto, we've got to collect photographs, data...
I've got all the proof I need.
Get going, Lucas.
Mark, we're not going anywhere until we've finished our work.
All right, David, if it will make you feel any better.
Oh, Doctor, would you mind staying behind and keep an eye on our prize?
KAY: Don't be long, David.
You better get some rest.
Hi.
I thought I'd come up and get some air.
What do you suppose is taking them so long?
David's very thorough.
But shouldn't you be resting, Kay?
I couldn't sleep.
Listen to the sounds.
DR. THOMPSON: Hunting calls, mostly.
Animals out for the kill.
Some of them are cries of fear, like people who whistle in the dark.
I'm not exactly blind.
You're worried about what's happened between Mark and David.
But once you admit the simple fact that you're in love, which you have, then it becomes a good idea to be the scientist about it.
It's not as easy as that.
Why not?
If it weren't for Mark Williams,
I wouldn't have my work or even a job.
It's true, he helped you through your training and gave you a job.
But he needed you just as much as you needed him.
You're oversimplifying.
You've more than repaid him many times over.
Why, a good part of his present position at the institute is due to your valuable research.
And another thing...
Get away, Kay!
Go on, get back! Go on!
Dr. Thompson!
How is he?
If infection doesn't set in, he may pull through.
The fool! It wouldn't have happened if he hadn't been careless.
There's no one to blame.
Four men dead so far.
If he dies, what a useless waste of experience and ability.
Nobody meant it to happen, David.
Mark, I'm for getting out of this lagoon just as fast as we can.
Without taking what we came for?
We didn't come here to fight with monsters.
We're not equipped for it.
We came here to find fossils.
Later, later, we can come back with a properly equipped expedition.
Be reasonable.
Reasonable?
What else could I expect?
But you, Carl, it means as much to you.
You're driving yourself too hard, and the rest of us along with you.
We're staying until we get him.
Or until somebody else gets killed.
No, we're not.
Lucas, we're getting out of here just as fast as we can.
Okay.
I'll make the decisions around here.
But you are wrong,
Mr. Williams.
On the water, the captain makes the decisions.
We will do as you say.
You'll listen to me.
You wish to say something, mister, huh?
Dr. Maia, will you please to pull up the anchor?
I will start the engine.
DR. MAIA Look Out!
There's something here.
Look out!
Look out!
Hold back. Hold back.
There's something here.
Hold back! Hold back!
LUCAS: I tell you, nothing was there when we came in.
It was put there to keep us from getting out.
By mm.
I check below for damage.
I go aft and keep watch.
You better stay with Thompson.
It's our last chance,
David, to get the proof.
Look, you can see for yourself, it's still here.
We're trapped and fighting for our lives, and you're worried about whether people will believe us.
Ls all right down below.
Go in the cabin and lock the door.
No, no. Stay here with us. You're safer.
Lucas.
Lucas, start your winch. Eh?
Go on, go on.
Start your winch.
Up an inch!
Hold it!
All right, give me some slack.
A little more.
Whoa!
Take it away!
Easy. A little more. Whoa.
Take it away!
Take it up.
More, more.
Hold it.
All right, take it away!
UP, up!
She must have slipped.
We'll just have to try it again.
How, David?
I'll have to use the Aqua-Lung.
I'm going to help him.
I'm going in with you.
Mark, all we're interested in right now is getting the entrance to this lagoon cleared.
I'll be the bait for him.
Oh, Mark, get out of my way.
Let it come to me, David.
It'll give you a chance to get at him.
You're crazy.
Crazy to want to bring back the biggest find anyone has ever made?
You don't know what this can mean, David, to all of us.
Mark, you're not going with me!
I am.
Thank you, Carl.
Lucas, stand by the winch.
Carl, stand by that cable.
Oh!
It's the only way.
We've got to clear this inlet.
Hey, that fellow down there, you think maybe he's a mosquito you can shoo away?
We've got to take that chance.
Oh, sure!
Whats an expedition without two martyrs, at least?
Kay, Kay, I'm doing the only thing we can do.
If we all just sit here, we'll all end up as Mark did.
Wait a minute!
Something you just said, about his not being a mosquito.
Maybe we won't have to fight him on his own terms after all.
How much rotenone have we got left?
Not enough.
Enough to use in a spray gun?
What?
Oh! You mean, to kill like a mosquito!
It worked for us before.
And it took plenty of time.
All we want is to make him groggy.
Keep him away long enough so I can get a cable around that tree.
What do we use for the spray gun?
One of the air bottles.
A solution of rotenone released under pressure, that ought to do the trick.
Some trick!
Come on!
Lucas, you stand guard.
YES.
Can you hurry it up?
I shoot him, but I miss!
He'll be back. Hurry.
Give me a hand!
KAY: David!
LUCAS: Si!
Did you see him?
He's there, all right.
Give me a hand with this equipment.
I'll help you.
I got the cable around the log.
Good.
Get ready with that winch.
All right.
I'll get her started.
Give it a little slack.
Ready to take her back.
Ready.
Uncleat that line for me, will you?
All right, take her back.
Take it back.
Hard astern.
She's coming.
Back. Back.
She's coming. Back.
Keep going. Hard astern.
Whoa! We're clear.
Stand by to pull her up with the winch.
Pull her in.
DAVID: That's it.
Whoa!
I'll go down and unfasten it.
Give me slack!
Good.
More slack.
Slack. That's enough.
LUCAS: That's good.
Now you're getting it.
Just slip it back through the ring.
Hurry, David!
DAVID: I've almost got it.
He got her.
No, don't shoot, don't shoot!
You might hit Kay.
Give me a hand.
Lucas, get to the beach entrance.
Kay!
DAVID: Kay!
Kay?
Kay. Kay, darling.
Oh, David. David!
Get back, Kay.
Get back!
DAVID: No, no more.
Let him go.
No.
Hi, Eddie.
- Hiya, Scotty.
Cold enough for you?
- Well, I'm only faintly alive. It's 25 below.
You know everybody?
- We haven't met.
McPherson.
- Hi.
Ned Scott, Capt. Hendry.
Scotty just got in today.
Hi, care to join us?
Wait till I count my fingers.
I may have lost one.
Scotty's a warm-weather man. We met at Accra. Quite a spot. 105 in the shade...
...and the women hardly wore anything at all. Very intelligent of them.
You just lie there in a hammock while three of them fan you.
Remember, Scotty?
- I remember.
Oh, boy. When I die I hope I go to Accra.
- I was there.
I'm in.
What are you doing here, Mr. Scott?
- Looking for a story.
Scotty's a newspaperman.
How many?
- Three.
Cards?
- I'll play these.
Caught from ambush.
- Check.
Well, I'll bet a buck.
- And I'll fold.
Call.
Pair of queens.
- I thought so. Aces.
You ought to know better than to try fooling our captain. Only dames can do that.
Lt. Dykes, I promise...
- Slip of the tongue.
What do you hear from the general?
- Fogarty's nursing secrets like a June bride.
I got an idea. A guy in Seattle knows a whole radar defense story...
...loves to talk.
General McLaren.
Tell General Fogarty you want to go to Seattle, and Pat and I will fly you there.
I met General McLaren too.
It's warm in Seattle. They got girls there without fur pants on.
What about it, captain?
- That could be right.
You won't be able to shoo our captain southward with his heart...
...wrapped around the North Pole.
- That'll do.
What's going on up there?
- Scientists are holding a convention.
Looking for polar bear tails.
- Ever hear of Dr. Carrington?
The fellow who was at Bikini?
- The same.
They're holding about 2000 miles north of here. A whole bunch.
Botanists, physicists, electronic...
- Including a pin-up girl.
Very interesting type too.
- Very.
Capt. Hendry can give you any data on her.
You probably shouldn't have said that.
- Well, after I read...
Now look!
Someday I hope to have a navigator and a copilot who are at least dry behind the ears.
Oh, captain.
- You mail-order...
Capt. Hendry, report to General Fogarty's quarters at once please.
8:00 at night and the general yelling for his troops. Sounds like the old days.
Take my hand. Will you?
- Yeah.
Captain, if it amounts to anything, bring me in on it. Will you, please?
Sure.
I gotta get a story someplace.
Come in.
Close the door.
- Yes, sir.
Good evening, sir.
- Didn't take you long.
Not many places to hide, sir.
Just got a queer message from your picnic party up north, from Dr. Carrington himself.
'Believe an airplane unusual type crashed in our vicinity.
Please send facilities to investigate.
Most urgent.'
What would you find up there besides a good-looking girl?
I don't know, sir. Any ships missing?
- No.
No Canadians either.
- Could be Russians.
They're all over the pole like flies.
- You're going.
Take along a dog team or anything you might need for rescue.
Come in.
Close the door!
You suppose the Pentagon could send us a revolving door?
Could be, sir. We got pith helmets last week.
Weather report, sir.
- Okay, that's all.
If any messages come in from Dr. Carrington,
I want to be notified personally.
No matter what the time.
- Yes, sir.
Here's your weather.
There's a front moving in...
...but you ought to have time to get there and back.
General, that newspaperman, Scott...
- What about him?
He'd like to go with us.
- It's all right if you maroon him up there.
Don't get me wrong about who gets marooned.
I'd like it if you didn't smash into the landing ski this time.
That was an unavoidable accident.
Well, look, I'll expect you back tomorrow night.
Yes, sir. And I'll close the door.
- Just tell me what you find up there.
No one tells me anything around here.
Want some coffee?
Hey, thanks.
- Here you are, sir.
Mr. Scott. Coffee.
Are we there?
- No, sir. Hot coffee up front, sir.
Lieutenant? Coffee, sir.
- Thank you, stewardess.
Coffee?
- Yeah, thanks.
How far are we from camp?
Three hours. We've slowed down.
A little headwind.
A little headwind?
Close to 40 miles.
Our captain has some funny ideas about the North Pole.
He thinks it's a garden spot.
Come and bring the kiddies.
Now look, don't you two guys start.
You know, Perry went to the North Pole once. He retired with a sack full of medals.
Hey, Pat.
We go there every three weeks just like it was lover's lane.
Mr. Scott, some people seem to think... Wait a minute.
Hello, Air Force 191 from
Polar Expedition 6. Can you read me?
Air Force 191. Hear you fine, Tex.
Go ahead.
What's your position?
- Three hours out.
Captain, switch over to your radio compass.
Check it against your magnetic heading.
What's on your mind, Tex?
We've got some disturbance up here.
It's whacking away at everything.
What do you figure it's from?
- Don't know. We noticed it last night.
Six to eight degrees difference.
- We're quite a bit off here, Tex.
You better home in on me.
I'll leave the key open.
Or would you rather have me sing to you?
- Leave the key open.
I was afraid you'd say that.
Hey, the taxpayers ought to see this.
Hello, doctor, professor.
Still the same game?
- Yes.
Hello, boys.
Doctor, professor. Here's your mail.
- You're just in time for lunch.
Ken, I bet you forgot my hairpins.
- Don't tell me I'm nearly at the North Pole.
Looks more like my Kentucky home.
- Mr. Scott, Mrs. Chapman.
A pleasure, Mrs. Chapman.
- Hi, nice to see you.
Dr. Chapman, Mr. Scott.
- Dr. Chapman.
Scotty's a newspaperman.
- You've come at an opportune time.
I happened to be in Anchorage when your message came. I hope you have a good story.
No more than you know already.
- Nothing more at all?
Just discussions as to what it might be.
We all have different ideas.
There's been arguments about it.
- Where's Dr. Carrington?
In the lab.
- See you later.
Does that mean you've seen the plane?
Coffee, captain?
- No, thanks.
Our captain seems in a hurry, Lee.
Where are you two going?
- We're with you.
We want to tell her she treated you badly.
- If you don't want us to go...
I'm gonna get even with you two someday.
- We got up in there.
Come in.
Hi, Pat. Welcome to our igloo.
How was your...?
Well...
How was your trip?
- All right. About usual.
Well, that's fine.
I think Dr. Carrington wants to see you.
- He can wait. I wanna talk to you.
What about?
- That was a dirty trick you played.
Don't lose your temper.
- Why did you do it? Just tell me why.
Well, your legs aren't very pretty.
You didn't have to write a note and put it on my chest.
I'm sorry, Pat...
Six people read it before I woke up.
Now the whole Air Force knows.
Not so loud. They'll hear.
- They already heard.
The only place it hasn't been is on a billboard.
I didn't know you had such a nasty temper.
Now, Pat, just be careful.
Now take it easy.
Now wait a minute.
We had a lot of fun when you were up here.
Then when you asked me down to Anchorage, you deliberately fed me...
Tell me, did you really drink all those drinks?
You didn't throw any away? Not one?
- No.
Holy cat. I thought I was good.
And another thing, why did you leave?
When I woke up in the morning you were gone.
I told you I had to take that cargo plane back here.
You told me?
- Don't you remember?
No.
Right after dinner. You were telling me all about a night in San Francisco...
Did I tell you that?
What else did I do?
Well, you had moments of kind of making like an octopus.
I never saw so many hands in all my life.
- All right. All right.
Look, my only excuse is that I liked you...
...right away.
So I started wrong. Can't we begin again?
- How would you begin?
Well, I can think of several...
- Never mind.
We don't have time for that now anyway.
I know Dr. Carrington's waiting to see you.
What about this business of starting over?
- We'll talk about that later.
Hello, captain.
- Hi, professor.
Dr. Carrington, Capt. Hendry is here.
- Yes, I know.
How do you do, captain?
- Doctor.
Miss Nicholson, would you add a note to the others?
Surely.
November 2, 11:30 A.M.
Deviation in sector 19 continues
12 degrees, 20 minutes east.
No lessening or wavering of disturbing element.
That's all.
Captain, can we start now?
- Mind telling me where we're going?
48 miles due east from here.
Your message said an airplane crashed.
Is that what we're looking for?
I don't know, captain.
I think you better explain.
- I'm sorry.
Miss Nicholson, would you read
Capt. Hendry my first notes?
I was thinking only of the vagueness of my information. I dislike being vague.
'November 1st...
- Yesterday.
...6:15 P.M. Sound detectors and seismographs registered explosion due east.
At 6:18, magnetometer revealed deviation
12 degrees, 20 minutes east.'
That deviation has been constant.
- We ran into it before we got here.
'Such deviation possible only if a disturbing force equivalent...
...to 20,000 tons of steel or iron ore...
- 20,000 tons?
...had become part of the earth at about a 50-mile radius.'
You're getting a bit beyond me, but it sounds like a meteor.
Yes, very much. Except for one thing.
Will, show it to Capt. Hendry.
- Yes, sir.
We have some special telescopic cameras.
On the appearance of radioactivity, a Geiger counter trips the release...
...and the cameras function.
They were working last evening.
This is the result.
This first picture was taken three minutes before the explosion...
...or 6:12.
You can see the small dot below there in the corner.
On the next picture, one minute later, that dot is moving from west to east...
...fast enough to form a streak.
- What shutter speed is it?
1000th of a second.
- Moving pretty fast. Wasn't it?
Here, at 6:14, it's moving upward.
6:15, it drops to the earth and vanishes.
A meteor might move almost horizontal to the earth but never upward.
Then it isn't a meteor.
- That's obvious.
How'd you find the distance of impact?
By computation...
- Dr. Carrington?
Ready?
- It's quite simple, captain.
We have the time of arrival of the sound waves and detectors.
And also the arrival time of the impact waves on the seismograph.
By computing the difference, it becomes obvious they were caused by the object.
The distance from here is 48 miles.
- I'll take your word for it.
One thing, doctor. 20,000 tons of steel is a lot of metal for an airplane.
It is for the sort of airplane we know, captain.
Yeah, we'd better be going.
- Redding will check every quarter-hour.
Will you want me, doctor?
- It won't be necessary.
You come with us, Bill.
- Yes, doctor.
We'll be there pretty soon now, Pat.
Bob, get Carrington up here.
Doctor!
We're almost 50 miles out, doctor.
With your compass deviation, how are you navigating, captain?
That peak ahead is practically due east.
We got the wind before we left camp.
Very good, captain.
- We should be there about now, Pat.
Ten. Nine. Eight. Seven. Six.
Picking up something on the Geiger counter, sir.
Five. Four. Three. Two. One.
Look there.
Pat, the compass is in a spin.
- Geiger's up to the top.
Yeah, that's it, all right.
You see someplace to set down?
- Looked smooth about a half a mile back.
We'll take a look. Bob!
Get them ready. It might be rough.
Right, sir.
Fasten your seat belts, gentlemen.
We're gonna land.
Sit down and hold on back there.
All set for landing, sir.
Half flaps.
Full rich.
- Full rich.
Half flaps.
There we are.
Holy cat! What a weird-looking thing.
Let me get a picture before you track up the whole place.
This Geiger counter is going crazy.
Something's melted that surface crust.
It's frozen over again into clear ice.
The bottle shape apparently was caused by the craft first making contact...
...with the earth out at the neck of the bottle...
...sliding toward us and forming that larger area as it came to rest.
With the engines generating enough heat to melt that path through the crust...
...then sink beneath the surface.
- What could melt that much ice?
Let's go down and see. Barnes.
Take the dogs over on that side.
Dr. Chapman, could an airplane melt that much ice?
One of our own jets generates enough heat to warm a 50-story office building.
It's part of an airfoil. Probably a stabilizer.
- It's an airplane, all right.
Can you tell what metal that is?
- I'll need some tools.
Barnes, bring some tools!
Hey, it's down pretty deep over here.
I can't see anything but a dark mass.
It's deeper over here.
Captain, may I suggest that we spread out and try to determine the size and shape.
Right. Spread out, everybody! We're gonna try to figure out the shape of this thing.
Here's the tools, sir.
Holy cat!
Hey...
It's almost...
Yeah. Almost a perfect...
It is. It's round.
We finally got one.
- We found a flying saucer!
Can anybody see anything through the ice?
Only an outline.
- Nothing but a dark shape.
Seems perfectly smooth.
No doors or windows.
I can't see any engine.
- I doubt we find anything we call an engine.
Dr. Carrington, this isn't any metal I know.
Probably some new alloy.
Get some filings for analysis.
- Right.
Captain, I don't think we have a chance of chopping through the ice with axes.
I know. We think so too.
We'll try to melt it out with thermite bombs.
Oh, excellent.
- Where do you figure it's from?
I don't know, Mr. Scott.
Well, from this planet?
- I doubt it.
Well, do you...?
- The answers will be much easier...
...after we've examined the interior of the aircraft...
...and its occupants, if there are any.
- Occupants? Why, I never...
What a story!
Where's the radio? Hey, Barnes!
Hold it. No private messages.
- What do you mean private?
I'm sending it to the whole world.
- This is Air Force information.
We'll have to wait for authority to let you file it.
You got your authority in the Constitution!
It's called freedom of the press.
I'm sending a story!
- Not from our ship.
Where do you want the bombs?
- One by the stabilizer...
...another over in the far side if we need it.
It's the biggest story since the parting of the Red Sea. You can't hide it!
Think what it means to the world.
- I don't work for the world.
Look...
- No, Scott. I'll take that.
Here's the detonator.
- Get back to the ship and call the camp.
Have Tex radio we've found a flying saucer in the ice. We're gonna try to get it out.
What about me?
- Also, ask if Scott can send his story.
That's all I can do.
- You're gonna grow up to be another Fogarty.
Where we gonna touch this off?
- Over there.
Have you looked to the west?
That front's moving fast...
...and the temperature's dropping too.
- We don't have more than an hour.
Where do you put those, Bob?
- Right on the surface.
Tell Stone. Will you, sir?
- Right.
Say, what will this thermite do?
This is S-O-P, standard operating procedure for removing ice.
Hook this wire up, will you, lieutenant?
It just melts it.
How fast does it work?
It'll uncover the whole saucer in 30 seconds.
All ready over here!
- Be right with you!
Better clear the field! Over near the dog sled! Gonna get pretty hot here in a minute.
Hook her up. We'll try the stabilizer first. Use the other one if we need it.
A few minutes from now we may have the key to the stars.
A million years of history are waiting for us in that ice.
Say when. I wanna get a picture.
- All ready, sir.
Ready here.
- Let her go, Bob.
Okay, all clear.
- Wait a minute, everybody. Stay back.
It's burning under the ice.
- Careful, captain.
What's happening?
Tell me, doctor.
Get down on the ground, everybody!
Everybody all right?
That last explosion was the engine.
Sergeant, will you try your Geiger counter?
Only a trace.
- That's just residual.
It's all gone.
Secrets that might have given us a new science.
Gone.
- That's just dandy.
Standard operating procedure.
I should've thought...
- You sure should.
Greatest discovery in history up in flames.
Turning a new civilization into a 4th of July piece.
Captain, I'm getting something over here.
Probably a fragment from the saucer.
- We may salvage something yet.
Hold it, everybody.
I'm getting a reaction.
Let me get a reading.
Getting warm.
Hotter now.
Here's where it's coming from.
What is it?
- Looks like a man.
It's got legs and a head.
I can see them.
Yeah! He must be over 8 feet long.
Somebody got out of that saucer.
- Or was thrown out.
And frozen fast before he could get clear.
Man from Mars.
- How do you propose getting him out?
I don't know.
- Use more thermite.
Whatever's quickest.
We don't have much time.
Here's axes. You could chop around and put the block on the plane.
I agree.
- Get started.
Give me room.
- Bob, clear the sled and bring it over here.
Eddie, get the ship warmed up.
And be ready to get out of here in a hurry.
Pat, I think we made a mistake.
- What do you mean?
You ever read this? 'Department of Defense, Office of Public Information.
Washington, D.C.
December 27, 1949.
Bulletin 629-49 regarding item 6700...
...extract 75,131.
The Air Force has discontinued investigating and evaluating reported flying saucers...
...on the basis that there is no evidence.'
Probably make you a general for destroying evidence that they're wrong.
'The Air Force said that all evidence indicates that the reports...
...of unidentified flying objects are the result of:
One: Misinterpretation of various conventional objects.'
Didn't look very conventional to me.
'Second: A mild form of mass hysteria.'
That'd be when General Fogarty got to shaking hands with that thing in the ice.
What are the other reasons?
'Third: That they're jokes.'
What did you say the number of that bulletin was?
'629-49, item 6700, extract 75,131.'
Oh. Oh, that one.
Get on that rope, professor.
- I need a hand over here.
Watch your feet.
Let me tie another rope to go down.
Hold it!
- Hold it back now.
Hold it!
Pull, back there!
Keep tight on those ropes!
Easy.
- Here we go.
Keep it going.
- Keep it going!
Whoa! Take it easy.
Can't see through the ice too good.
Good enough to know that where he came from, they don't breed them for beauty.
Well, what do we do now, defrost him?
This ice will melt pretty soon.
Can you control the heat in this room?
- No, captain. This is our storeroom.
The temperature's constant here.
We don't need to melt it.
We can chip it away.
We're not going to melt it or chip it. Eddie, open that window.
We're not allowed to examine it?
- I mean just that.
This is stupid.
- We're scientists.
And Dr. Carrington's in charge here.
- Hey, Pat, these windows don't open.
It's practically certain we'll be asked by your superiors to study it.
Probably, but we can't permit it now.
- We don't need permission...
Eddie, break that window.
- All right.
Sorry. We already pulled one boner out in the ice.
We may not know anything about this...
...but until I receive instructions from my superior officer, we'll have to mark time.
You have no authority...
- If you want to talk, do it in the corridor.
It's gonna get cold in here.
- At last a sensible suggestion, captain.
Mac.
- Yeah?
Please stay here.
And take four-hour shifts.
It's hands off for everyone.
- Yes, sir.
Gonna be warm enough?
- If not, you'll hear me squawk.
Bob will bring you dinner.
- I could use something to read.
A nice, quiet horror story.
- Might be kind of tame for you, sir.
Well, gentlemen?
- Capt. Hendry...
Excuse me, doctor. May I?
- Certainly.
In relation to removing the body from the ice, I'd like to point out...
...there are organisms that survive after death, but cold can destroy them.
In view of that...
- I don't know...
But these organisms may be dangerous. They may be carrying germs from another planet.
Germs we couldn't cope with medically.
- Thank you.
I can't agree with you, Dr. Chapman.
- I don't either.
Here's another: We don't know what effect the air of our Earth...
...may have on this creature's remains.
- Sort of go up in smoke, like the saucer?
Nonsense.
- Isn't that far-fetched?
So is a man from Mars.
- We're getting nowhere.
I suggest that Capt. Hendry communicate with his superior at once.
I'm getting senile.
We should have done that first thing.
I'm surprised, captain, that you didn't try to reach your general on our way back here.
We did. Barnes.
I tried through your radio operator.
Couldn't get through. Too much interference.
I see. My apologies, captain.
- Yes, doctor.
Hi, captain.
- Hi, Tex.
You sure stirred up a lot of trouble...
Did you send out my message?
- Sure did.
Get an answer back?
- This came an hour ago. Can you read it?
No, you'd better.
- 'Fogarty to Hendry:
Withhold newspaper story until permission from Air Force HQ.'
There you are, Scotty.
- Fine. Now somebody else will get the story.
'Remove aircraft from ice at once. Use thermite bombs if necessary to melt ice.'
Oh, that's what I like about the Army.
Smart all the way to the top.
That lets you off the hook for the thermite...
- Take it easy. Go ahead.
'Erect temporary structure to protect aircraft until my arrival.'
Here's another one. Came a few minutes ago.
Could only get part of it.
Go ahead.
- 'Everything grounded. Can't...' Something.
'Want you...' Something or other...
- That sounds like Fogarty.
Then it got fouled up.
- You're getting nothing?
Nothing. Static's knocking it right out of the air.
What about your stuff?
- Don't know if they're getting it. I doubt it.
I don't believe it.
Even the Pony Express got through.
Well, doctor?
- In view of this new situation...
Doesn't alter the old one.
- We disagree with you.
There's no reason to delay...
- Sorry, gentlemen. That's it.
Tex, I'd like to leave Barnes to help out all he can.
Sure.
- Barnes, keep trying to get through.
I wanna get a message to the general.
Tell him the aircraft was completely destroyed by the thermite bomb.
Tell him we found a passenger...
- A fellow from Mars? Where?
On ice, buddy.
Tell him the body's in ice and Dr. Carrington wants permission...
...to remove the body from the ice for examination.
We're standing by for instructions before further action.
Yes, sir.
You got anything to add, doctor?
- Yes, one very essential point.
That it's vitally important that the examination be made.
By all means. Yeah.
- Add that, Barnes.
Thank you, captain.
That's all that concerns me.
When you get your answer,
I expect you to let me know.
Yes, doctor.
Wait till I interview the doctor about what he thinks of you.
Probably be good.
- If it isn't, I'll make it good.
Tex, keep trying. Barnes, if he gets through, ask again about clearing Mr. Scott.
Don't try to soft-soap me.
I don't like you any better.
I'll eat with you, Eddie.
- I'll send you some chow.
Captain, I'm gonna check the ship and tie her down. We'll need our gear.
This storm may blow for weeks.
- Get the Eskimos to help.
They took off when they saw that ice.
They'll need a lot of coaxing to get them back.
If Mr. Scott and the lieutenant would give me a hand...
I'm a guest.
- I'm an officer.
You can order me around while carrying the other end.
That'll help a lot, sarge.
You know, Pat? I thought we were gonna have a little trouble.
So did I.
- The geniuses were ready to tear you apart.
They're like kids drooling over a new fire engine.
Professor Vorhees, come to the laboratory as soon as possible.
Holding a meeting. Whole thing's weird.
- You know what it reminds me of?
The time I was stuck on Beulen Island with the old 97th bomber group.
An Army nurse came ashore and caused the same disturbance...
...as this guy from Mars has here.
- What happened to the nurse?
She liked it there.
Scotty, what's new?
- What's new? What more do you want?
Biggest story ever to hit this planet, and I run into this human clam.
Why are you getting pretty?
You'll never look good to me.
That's not for you...
- Take it easy.
The captain here passes the buck to
General Fogarty, he takes it to Washington.
Who will Truman ask?
- Margaret.
I've got to find a way to get to civilization.
- How, for instance?
I don't know. Pogo sticks. Kiddie cars.
Gondolas. Dogsleds.
Hey, Barnes, any word come from Fogarty?
- Plenty. Nothing about you, sir.
I think the old man's gone crazy.
Sorry, sir. Shouldn't have said that.
If he hollers louder, we won't need a radio.
- What was the gist of the conversation?
There's been a leak, and the newspapers...
- I knew it! Like water through a sieve.
Everyone wants information,
Congress, Secretary of State...
...and especially General Fogarty.
He's having a fit.
Isn't Anchorage picking us up?
- No, sir.
We're picking up them because they have a stronger station.
A picture just came to me:
My editor climbing all over his office...
...yelling, stamping his feet.
He'll probably shoot himself by midnight.
Take it easy, Scotty.
- Just a minute. I'm not sure you're ready.
You may have missed a spot.
Son, would you like double guard duty tonight?
No, sir. I wouldn't.
Oh, captain.
- Yes, sergeant?
Could I see you for a minute, sir?
- Sure.
What is it, Bob?
It's about Lt. McPherson sitting in there with that thing in the block of ice.
Getting nervous?
Well, he wouldn't want me to tell you, sir, but he's having kittens.
I haven't heard him squawk like this since Rechenberg.
Really?
You see, sir, the ice is clearing up, and we can see that thing pretty good.
It's got crazy hands and no hair, and the eyes...
They're open and look like they can see.
- Bob, I haven't heard you...
It's got me too, sir, and I wasn't in there very long.
Besides that, it's pretty cold.
I got the lieutenant an electric blanket.
Captain, I got a suggestion.
- Go ahead.
Instead of four-hour shifts, we could cut them in half...
Okay. You tell Barnes to take over at 2200.
You take over at 2400, and I'll relieve you at 0200.
I think you're right, sir.
- I think you are.
Thank you, sir.
I want to talk to you.
- Sure.
Pat, what's really going on?
Nothing. I just can't agree with your pals.
I had to set a guard.
They'd have that thing up waltzing with them.
No, that isn't what I meant.
What does that boogeyman in ice really mean?
I don't know, Nikki.
Well, does it mean that we'll have visitors from other planets dropping in on us?
Do we have to return the call, or...?
Oh, jeepers.
I know. Yesterday I'd said it was crazy.
- I'd say it's crazy now.
Forget it. Tomorrow it'll all seem different.
I suppose so. I like the way you handled this whole mess, Pat.
I'd just as soon not.
You know, it's funny. I'm glad I was here.
I am too.
You're much nicer when you're...
When you're not mad.
Sounds promising. How about that business of beginning over again?
Well, I think I'll buy you a drink this time.
I think you've earned it.
That is, if you want one.
- You can tie my hands if you wanna.
That might not be such a bad idea.
- You mean that?
Well, you suggested it.
- All right. I'll bring a rope.
You want another one, Pat?
- Don't you think you could untie me now?
I don't know. What's the matter?
You gals. If a guy asks you to dinner and buys you a drink and tries to kiss you...
Why are you laughing?
- You never kissed me.
I haven't tried.
- How do you know?
Oh, stop bringing that up.
- Never mind. You haven't. Maybe if you'd...
Go on with what you were saying.
- What?
About the dinner and the drink.
Well, if the same man asked you to have 30,000 dinners...
Then he's not a wolf anymore?
That's fine philosophy.
So you really want your hands untied.
Just when everything was nice and peaceful.
You know, I'm glad we decided to start over again. I like it.
I like that too.
- Talk about Japanese tortures.
No, not at all. I think this was a great idea.
Come here.
Well, look at you...
...sitting there like a civilized man instead of grabbing around like a throwback.
If you weren't tied up, I wouldn't dare have told you how much I liked you.
You know, Pat, the trouble with you is that you don't know anything about women.
What a woman wants is to...
Is to...
How long have you been loose?
- Long enough.
It's been a very interesting evening.
Good night, Miss Nicholson.
Pat, if you walk out on me like this...
- I wouldn't go, except I gotta check up.
Get a good night's sleep.
I'll see you in the morning.
It's the eyes being open that gets you.
Makes you feel so...
Hi, Pat. Barnes just got here. Sure glad
I'm not looking at that guy anymore.
All set, Barnes?
- Yes, sir.
Got an electric flying suit and coffee.
- Bob will relieve you at 2400.
Take it easy.
- Yeah.
That's better.
Capt. Hendry! Capt. Hendry!
Capt. Hendry.
What's the matter, corporal?
Where's the captain? I've got to tell him that thing's alive. I saw it.
It chased me. It's not dead. It's...
Capt. Hendry!
That thing's alive, sir.
I saw it. I shot at it. I hit it, I know it.
Nothing happened. It kept coming at me, making a noise like a cat meowing.
If you could have seen those hands and those eyes! You've got to do something...
Mac, Bob, get some guns.
Now, Barnes, what happened?
I'm sorry, sir. I don't know exactly, but all of a sudden it was alive and coming at me.
I shot at it and hit it.
Nothing happened, so I ran...
Easy, easy.
- I'm sorry, sir.
Here, captain.
- Take care of him. Will you?
Get back to sleep.
Get back with the rest of them.
What could've...?
- Kid said he was alive. I believe him.
I knew it. All the time I was here,
I could feel it.
Here's what did it.
This blanket was on. It's still warm.
He got out of here, all right.
- Get parkas, boots and a flashlight!
Listen. They'll tear him to pieces.
- We must save him.
Hold it, doctor. You'll freeze to death in five minutes. Use your head!
I expect you're right. I was overanxious.
- Look over here, captain!
I think I've got yours.
- May I have one, captain?
Better let us go, doctor.
Doc, can you see anything out there?
- Not much.
You all set?
- Let her go.
Captain, it would help if you, any of you, would describe what you saw out there.
It was too cold to see well, but the dogs had him down.
He got up with three hanging on his arm.
- He threw one at the rest.
Two were dead.
- Looked like they'd been through a chopper.
Where did you find the arm?
- Partly under one of them.
Could dogs tear off an arm?
This kind of an arm.
Be careful, doctor. Those barbs are sharp.
- Seems to be a sort of chitinous substance.
Speak English.
Something between a beetle's back and a rose thorn.
Thorn-fingered?
- Amazingly strong.
Very effective as a weapon.
- Very.
We don't have to worry about that. An arm off and out in that cold, he's dead now.
Got along fine in a block of ice for 24 hours.
Pretty spry for a guy with 12 dogs on him.
- And for losing an arm.
I'm losing my mind.
- Amazing, isn't it?
Amazingly strong.
- Strange.
I'm sure of it.
- That is blood on the hand. Isn't it?
Yes, but not his.
- Probably from one of the dogs.
There's no blood in the arm, no animal tissue.
Dr. Stern, would you have a look at this under the microscope?
No, Mr. Scott. I doubt very much if it can die, as we understand dying.
Holy cat!
- Yes.
Well, doctor?
No arterial structure indicated.
No nerve endings visible.
Porous, unconnected cellular growth.
Just a minute, doctor. Sounds like you're trying to describe a vegetable.
I am. Are you getting all of this?
- Oh, for Pete's sake!
You know, doctor, that could be why
Sgt. Barnes' bullets had no effect.
That's right.
- Merely holes drilled into vegetable matter.
This green fluid here.
Like plant sap.
- We'll probably find it has a sugar base.
Please, doctor, I've got to ask this.
It sounds like, well... Just as though you're describing some form of super carrot.
That's nearly right, Mr. Scott.
This carrot, as you call it, has constructed an aircraft capable of flying millions of miles...
...propelled by a force as yet unknown to us.
An intellectual carrot. The mind boggles.
- It shouldn't.
Imagine how strange it would have seemed during the Pliocene age...
...to forecast that worms, fish, lizards that crawled over the Earth would evolve into us.
On the planet from which our visitor came...
...vegetable life underwent an evolution similar to that of our own animal life...
...which would account for the superiority of its brain.
Its development was not handicapped by emotional or sexual factors.
Dr. Carrington, you won the Nobel Prize.
You've received every kind of kudos a scientist can attain.
If you were for sale, I could get a million bucks for you from any foreign government.
I'm not, therefore, gonna stick my neck out and say you're stuffed full...
...of wild blueberry muffins. But I promise you, my readers are gonna think so.
Not for long, Mr. Scott. Not if they know anything about the flora of their own planet.
You mean there are vegetables right here on Earth that can think?
A certain kind of thinking, yes.
You ever hear of the telegraph vine?
Not recently.
- Or the...
Is it the acanthus century plant, Dr. Stern?
- Yes.
Go ahead, doctor. That's your field.
Well, the century plant catches mice, bats, squirrels, any small mammals.
Uses a sweet syrup as bait, then holds onto its catch and feeds on it.
What's the telegraph vine?
The vine, research has proven, can signal to other vines of the same species...
...vines 20 to 100 miles away.
Intelligence in plants and vegetables is an old story, Mr. Scott.
Older even than the animal arrogance that has overlooked it.
That's one for Ripley.
- Look here.
I took this from under the soft tissue in the palm of the hand.
A seedpod.
- Seedpod?
Yes. The neat and unconfused reproductive technique of vegetation.
No pain or pleasure as we know it.
No emotions...
...no heart.
Our superior. Our superior in every way.
Gentlemen, do you realize what we've found?
A being from another world as different from us as one pole from the other.
If we can only communicate with it...
...we can learn secrets that have been hidden from mankind since the beginning...
Holy cat. It's moving.
Miss Nicholson.
- Yes, doctor?
At 12:10 A.M., the hand became alive.
The temperature of the forearm showed a 20-degree rise.
Because of this rise in temperature,
I believe it was able to ingest...
...the canine blood with which it was covered. I believe...
You mean...
You mean it lives on blood.
This is the best we could find.
- This should work.
Where are you going?
- To find our visitor, if we can.
One moment, captain!
Check the storeroom again.
Bolt any outside doors.
Captain, when you find what you're looking for...
...remember it's a stranger in a strange land.
The only crimes were those committed against it.
It woke from a block of ice, was attacked by dogs and shot by a frightened man.
All I want is to communicate with it.
- Fine, provided it's locked up.
If we catch him, let me take his picture before somebody makes a salad of him.
Sure, Scotty.
Bob, get up on there.
- What's up? Looks like a lynching party.
Have any visitors?
- Not a soul.
I got part of a message from the general.
He said to wait on Mr. Scott's story.
What's the difference?
Nothing's going out anyway.
What are you looking for?
- Couldn't come in here.
Who?
- The man from Mars.
You mean he's alive and loose?
Keep your door locked. Use your axe if you have to. Gun's no good.
What do you mean the gun's no good?
Now, look...
Eddie.
Hold it, captain.
There's something in here, all right.
- You're a little off base.
That's the mineralogy lab.
Radioactive isotopes are in there.
Your Geiger's reacting to a roomful of uranium ore samples.
Yeah.
This door's locked.
- Dr. Stern has the key.
Oh, yes.
- What's in here?
The greenhouse. The Eskimos have a weakness for our strawberries.
Strawberries at the North Pole.
- Excuse me.
Mac. Bob.
Look under these tables.
Bob, check that outside door.
Door's locked, sir.
- Nothing up here.
We're still batting zero.
Well, doctor?
- Captain, I...
Nothing up that other corridor.
- Any suggestions, doctor?
He's obviously not inside.
- We'll start looking outside...
Close the door, please.
- Never mind.
Captain, half an hour outside now is all we can stand. We'd better do it in relay.
You're right, Dr. Chapman. We'll work out...
- Would you close the door, please?
We have to tell General Fogarty what happened.
We're liable to become famous.
So few people can boast they've lost a flying saucer and a man from Mars all in one day.
Wonder what they'd have done to Columbus if he'd discovered America, then mislaid it.
Bunch of butterfingers.
Gentlemen, I just happened to notice...
Look at these moles.
They're wilted.
The only thing that could...
A blast of icy air if that rear door was opened.
Have a look at that lock, professor.
- Yes.
10 or 15 seconds of exposure would do it.
- Exactly.
What would that lead you to?
That it may have been...
In here.
- Without a doubt.
Dr. Carrington, you were right.
The lock's been forced back into position.
The key's gone. Someone has entered and gone and locked the door from...
From the outside.
- Look. See how it glistens in the light?
It's a smear of...
Plant sap. From the wounded arm?
- You don't suppose...?
Open it, please.
One of the sled dogs.
- Not even cold yet.
Doctor, doesn't it seem kind of...?
- Shrunken. Is there any blood in there?
None.
- No blood.
No blood?
- Its blood has been drained.
Everything falls right into line.
What could be more natural for such a being than seeking out the only open earth nearby?
It came here for refuge, heard us and ran.
It's been here. It will come back again.
- We better tell...
I don't agree. It's far better if science rather than the Army...
Are you sure this is the best thing to do?
- I'm sure we can communicate with it.
It's wiser than we are. It's our only chance to talk to it, to learn so many things.
Dr. Carrington is right.
- Surely you understand that, Stern.
Will you two stand guard here with me tonight?
Surely, doctor.
- All right.
Stern, tell Dr. Auerbach and Dr. Olson what we've found.
Ask them to come back and relieve us in the morning.
And tell them, please, to confide in no one.
Any luck, captain?
- Lee, you better get some more coffee ready.
Find anything, captain?
- Not a sign.
Barnes flushed a polar bear.
- Sure did.
Scare you?
- Not after I saw it was only a bear.
Too cold out there for that.
- You didn't find anything.
I didn't think you would.
When we lose them, they stay lost.
Not that it makes much difference.
Nothing's coming in on the radio.
Tex, you got something?
- General Fogarty's running a temperature.
This came in clear 10 minutes ago, then it got fouled up again.
'Fogarty to Hendry: Take all precautions to preserve aircraft carefully until my arrival.'
Same to same.'Use same precautions with corpses of any occupants.'
Same to same.
'Forward detailed description of aircraft.
Measurements, approximate weight and so forth. Important.'
'Fogarty to Hendry: Why haven't you answered? Want immediate answer.'
Same to same.'Radio silence unnecessary.
Reference message Fogarty to Hendry.
Acknowledge immediately.
Waiting report. Silence confusing.'
Same to same.'Acknowledge. '
Same to same...
- Acknowledge at once.
I gather he wants to hear from me.
- There's nothing for me? I don't believe it.
How can a man get to be a general without...?
In the greenhouse...
See...
Barnes, watch that corridor.
- Bring the first aid kit.
Captain, this is my job.
- Bob, better start warning the rest of camp.
Does that speaker system work from here?
- Yes. The left switch runs to all rooms.
Attention, everybody in camp.
Bolt your doors.
Our visitor has returned and is dangerous.
Stay where you are until notified.
Stay where you are.
Easy. It'll be all right.
- What happened, doctor?
In the greenhouse,
I was working. I couldn't see.
Then a blast of cold air, and I heard Olson scream.
When I turned, the thing struck at me.
- Go on.
I don't remember. My head...
I must have fallen.
When I came to, I saw Olson and Auerbach.
They were...
Give him some more of that. Get those axes.
Go ahead, doctor.
They were both hanging from the beams upside down, dead. Their throats were cut.
I crawled...
- Was it there when you left?
I couldn't see.
Here you are, sir.
- Wait, Pat! I want to get a picture.
Wait a minute. He could get out of the greenhouse through the outside door.
We can get to it through the generator room.
- You two go with him.
You mean go in?
- Seal the door with anything you can find.
That's better.
Easy. Give them time to get in there.
- Pat, I want a picture.
You get back with the rest.
- Don't be silly.
It'll cost you a drink.
- I'll buy him a beer.
Ready, Bob?
- No, but go ahead and open it.
Get something to prop this door, something short enough to get under this bolt!
Get your picture, Scotty?
- No. The door wasn't open long enough.
Want me to open it again?
- No!
Bring a hammer and some spikes!
- Hit that in, will you?
There. That ought to do it.
Doctor Chapman, you're sure there's no other way out? No windows?
Only the front and back doors.
- The walls solid?
Corrugated iron.
- You don't think that...?
You found a dog in there, bled white by our visitor. Why didn't you report it?
It wasn't necessary.
- It was necessary to leave friends to die?
I posted them as guards...
I looked in. They're hanging upside down like in a slaughterhouse. Wish you'd seen it.
Can't we do something?
- They're dead.
Let's see nobody joins them. Doctor, you're limited to your room, lab and the mess hall.
You have no authority of any kind.
No right to assume...
You better move along.
We've got the rear door blocked.
If he gets out...
...he'll have to dig through oil drums and a couple tons of snow.
Bob, next time raise the sights a little.
- I was too busy to think about that.
We're gonna have to set up a guard here in the corridor.
Two-hour shifts. We'll need volunteers.
- Count me in, captain.
You sent for us, doctor?
You said you had news for us, doctor.
Yes, yes. I...
Gentlemen, we find ourselves in a battle.
I'm not referring to the minor argument with Capt. Hendry...
...but this creature from a new world.
Two of our colleagues have died, a third is injured.
Those are our losses, and there may be more.
This creature is more powerful and intelligent than we are.
He regards us as important only for his nourishment.
He has the same attitude toward us as we have toward a field of cabbages.
That is our battle.
Only science can conquer him.
All other weapons will be powerless, only...
There must...
There must be a way. I've been trying to...
Sorry. I'm very tired. I haven't slept.
It's difficult...
Difficult to talk.
Will you read my notes, Miss Nicholson?
- Doctor, you need some rest.
Yes, I know, but...
Please read my notes.
'At 9:00 P.M., I placed the seeds taken from the severed hand of X...
...in four inches of earth.
I saturated the earth...
I saturated the earth with two units of plasma taken from our blood bank.
The condition of the dog found in the greenhouse indicated blood...
...was a primal factor in the cultivation of the seeds.
At 2:00 A.M...
At 2:00 A.M., the first sprouts appeared through the soil.'
Five hours.
- Yes. I used another two units of plasma.
At 4:00 A.M., the sprouts began to take on definite form.
I came to the conclu...
I see by your faces you don't believe me.
Well, you may judge for yourselves.
Oh, no. It isn't possible.
It reproduces itself.
- Amazing speed.
This would bear out
Capt. Hendry's impression.
When he saw the creature in the greenhouse, it had grown a new arm.
This pulsating, doctor?
- As though they were breathing.
Yes. Human plants.
- Superhuman.
All this because of the blood plasma?
- That's correct.
Notice these, closer to the source of the plasma. While these, farther away.
How many units have we?
- Enough, I hope.
Would you care to listen to them,
Professor Wilson?
Yes, thank you. I should.
Well?
Almost like the wail of a newborn child that's hungry.
That's the way I would have described it.
- Doctor?
Yes, Miss Nicholson?
- Would you mind very much if I...?
Will you be needing me anymore?
- No. Just finish typing my notes.
Return them to me.
Let no one see them.
Doctor, I think you should get some sleep.
There's too much to do.
Your mind can't work if you're exhausted.
- My mind's still clear.
No, it isn't, doctor. You aren't thinking of what's happening in the greenhouse.
He's growing those seeds in there using blood. Just as you are.
You've seen what one creature like that can do. Just imagine a thousand.
I have imagined it.
- Arthur...
...what if that aircraft came not just to visit the Earth...
...but to conquer it? To start growing some kind of horrible army?
To turn the human race into food for it?
- Many things threaten our world...
...new stars, comets shooting...
- But those are theories.
This is an enemy here.
- There are no enemies in science...
...only phenomena to study.
We are studying one.
Come in.
Hello, Pat.
- Hi. Nikki, I want to ask you something.
Has anybody up here been hurt lately?
Anybody shot, stabbed or operated on?
No. That what-is-it in the greenhouse has been our first diversion.
I brought up 35 units of blood plasma two months ago. What's become of it?
Why do you want to know?
- Why are they not giving it to Dr. Stern?
They're giving him blood transfusions instead of plasma. Two live donors.
What's Carrington doing with
35 units of blood plasma?
I guess...
I guess you'd better take a swing at my chin and have a look at those notes.
I should be trying to stop you.
So that's what he's been doing.
Thanks. Thanks for not stopping me.
Pat, would you remember something?
He's tired.
He hasn't slept since you found that thing. And he's not thinking right.
I know him. And he doesn't think the way we do anyway.
But he's found something no one can understand. Until he can solve it, he'Il...
You know, like a kid with a new toy...
- Only this toy's liable to bite him.
Thanks again.
Where's Dr. Carrington?
I'm sorry. I have no authorization to give you any...
I'm very busy.
- I know you're busy, doctor.
I understand you've been gardening.
Where are they?
Why?
- This way to the nursery, Pat.
I don't tolerate intrusions into my laboratory. Don't touch.
This is what your colleagues are doing in the greenhouse.
This is an improvement.
- What happened was not my fault.
We've read your notes.
You should have consulted us.
I have the help I need.
Your opinion has not been asked.
It has by Capt. Hendry. And I've given it to him. I'll repeat it for you.
We're facing something unpredictably dangerous.
The creature in the greenhouse is obviously multiplying itself.
We have no way of finding out how much.
It will need more blood and will try to obtain what it needs.
It's imprisoned and harmless.
- How can you be sure of our safety?
Or the safety of the world?
Think of 1000 such creatures. 10,000. It must be destroyed, this progeny with it.
No.
- We can burn these.
What about that thing in the greenhouse?
- You're like frightened boys.
You're right. I am frightened.
- Any destruction would be an outrage...
...a betrayal of science.
- It may be.
But I'll sleep better if we get rid of it.
- Captain, Barnes finally...
...got a message through.
Here's the answer.
Go ahead.
- 'Fogarty to Hendry:
Carrington informs me Martian alive.
Keep it alive and protect it against injury.
Under no circumstances take action against it until my arrival.'
You have your orders, Capt. Hendry.
I consider them sane and intelligent.
But, Tex, what about me?
- Not a thing, Scotty.
What do we do, Pat?
- Try changing the Army's mind.
Hey! Hey, it's me, Eddie!
What are you doing here?
- We can't take it out there.
Drop the idea of guarding from the outside.
The wind's blowing so hard you can't see.
It can go through walls as easy as doors.
How could it get through iron walls?
- Use a can opener.
We're dropping the outside guard.
- Put that hand in some ice water.
Who's out in the corridor?
- Stone and Wilson, sir.
Barnes, tell them they're the only ones on guard. Tell them to watch it.
Tex?
- Here I am.
You won't be long.
We're dropping the outside guard.
Come join the rest of them in the mess hall.
I'll be all right. I've got the door braced, and there's no outside windows.
All right. If you want to be brave.
Well.
- Pat, what are we gonna do?
Anybody around here want some coffee?
No, but you can come in.
That's the reason I brought it.
I was hoping you might ask me in.
Who wants some?
- I could use a half.
What were you saying, Scotty?
- I was wondering... That's enough. Thanks.
What happens if our boyfriend gets lonely and strolls around and ends up in here?
I've been figuring that.
- Nothing hurts it.
What do you do with a vegetable?
- Boil it.
What'd you say?
- Boil it. Stew it. Bake it. Fry it.
That makes sense.
- Cold doesn't bother it.
Maybe Dr. Carrington will ask it to crawl into a boiler.
Maybe you could borrow a flamethrower.
- Captain, I got a crazy idea.
We got lots of kerosene and we could...
Point three. Point four.
- Here's where we start cooking.
Point five. Point six.
That thing's out of the greenhouse.
Stay together.
Point nine. What about throwing kerosene on it and setting it on fire?
We can try.
- Here's a full can.
I'll take it. We'll need something to put it in.
Here's a pail.
- Here's another.
One point two.
- We need one more.
Pat, this one will work all right.
- Good.
Watch that cigarette, lieutenant.
How we gonna set it on fire, rub sticks together?
There's a Veri pistol in my bag.
- I'll get it.
If it comes in, you wet it down.
Mac, touch it off. And don't miss.
You be ready if it needs more.
- You're right.
Shut up.
- One point three now.
You know how to shoot that?
- I saw Gary Cooper in Sergeant York.
One point four.
- Come here. Get in the corner.
Hold this in front of you.
Stay by the light switch.
One point five. One point six.
What was that?
- It sounded like a window.
One point eight.
- Turn off those lights.
One point nine.
The needle's hit the top.
Put the fire out!
- I am!
Watch it, captain!
Block that window!
- Hey, Scotty!
This will make your hand feel better.
- Thank you.
This ought to be enough kerosene.
- Get it ready.
How's it coming, Barnes?
- It'll be okay.
What makes me mad is he didn't do it.
I busted it falling over the bunk.
Listen, we want you all to stay here.
We found a way to fight this thing, but burned out a room.
It's not hurt much, from the way it took off.
- About as much effect as a hot foot.
It's sure to come back.
We don't want to burn the whole place.
So we're going after it.
It probably went to the greenhouse.
We'll start there.
Meantime, stay here.
Watch the door into the hallway.
Keep your eye on the Geiger counter.
- Here are the fire extinguishers.
Who's your electrical expert?
- That's my line.
Can you hook into the intercom system?
- We can take one from any room.
I can help.
- Mac, we'll be in the radio room.
Let us know when you're ready.
You all right?
Yeah. I'd like to tag along.
- Haven't you had enough?
If I start burning up again, who'll put out the fire?
We're very proud of our captain.
Now, look, put one of the intercoms here. That'll take care of this end.
Put another down here at the junction.
See if they work through the mess hall.
You said you were gonna use kerosene again.
Know anything better?
- Something hotter. Why not use electricity?
You mean your lighting system?
- No, we can hook in a new transformer.
It will give us plenty of amps.
- Enough to burn him?
More than enough.
- Could you use leads to two poles?
If you insulate the poles.
- Sounds good.
Bob, give him a hand.
Come on, Tex. You go to work.
Get Anchorage if you can.
Tell them the whole story.
Tell them we're in bad shape and to bring hand grenades, mortars...
...flamethrowers, anything.
Tell them if I don't send a story,
I'm gonna shoot myself.
Better comb your hair first.
- What hair?
Hey, say that again.
- Oh, Nikki, not you too.
He's sensitive.
- You too.
I got hair.
- Doesn't make you prettier.
No, your breath.
- I'm sorry.
He's sensitive about that too.
- I've been upset.
You ninnies. Look. That's what I mean.
- Hey, look. You too.
It's getting cold.
- The heat must be off.
It is off.
It's not getting oil.
See if it's the same across the hall.
Tex, where do these heaters get oil?
- Around behind. Outside.
Pat, heat's off in the mess hall!
- No.
No more oil coming in.
- It's off in there too.
Could the tank be empty?
- Filled day before yesterday.
The main line could be plugged.
Better fix it.
Probably run into our visitor, who'd be waiting for you.
We underestimate this guy.
Trying to freeze us out, huh?
- That isn't gonna be hard.
It's down to 40 degrees.
- It's 60 below outside.
How long will these rooms hold heat?
- Half an hour.
By then, we'll be stiff.
- If no one goes out...
...won't it think of something else?
It'll think that our only chance to keep warm is electricity. Heaters, blankets.
It could break the circuit, cut a line, except at the source.
The generator room.
- Get them all in there.
I'll tell Tex.
- Bring food, medicine, blankets, clothes.
Bring our flying clothes.
- Most got burned. I'll see what I can salvage.
Get the transformer hooked up to that.
- It's cold in here.
The thing's turned the heat off.
- What?
What'll we do?
- I don't know.
The next thing's electricity, so everybody's in the generator room.
Did you do a good job on the outside door?
Houdini'd find it tough getting in.
- He'll come through here.
It's the only way. Got any fence wire strong enough for the voltage?
Whole rolls of it.
- That'll work.
What?
- Lay it on the ground.
A lead overhead and on each side.
When it gets to the spot, juice him.
I don't get you.
- Where's the wire?
Down here.
- Give me those.
What are you doing?
- We'll rig an electric flytrap for him.
What do you mean?
Scotty, get me a hammer and nails.
- Sure.
Better get out of the way.
Looks as if the situation's well in hand.
- I've given all the orders I'm gonna give.
If I thought that were true,
I'd ask you to marry me. Here's your coat.
I wanna keep my mind open.
Hammer and nails.
- Down there.
Where do you want us?
- In the generator room. Move along.
Sorry, changed my mind. It's all off.
- Keep moving, everybody.
I want another word with you.
- No time now. Move along.
Make way. Clear this out.
Clear this place.
Where are those cutters?
- Here.
Where's your Geiger counter?
- I got one too.
Go to the assembly room.
If you get anything, come running.
Get me a pair of gloves.
- Use mine.
Leave enough to hook the overhead wire.
- Got plenty.
Here we are, lieutenant.
- Yeah, that ought to give us a ground.
There she is, captain.
- Down to five degrees now.
Perfect for skiing.
- Better get rubber boots, Scotty.
Why?
- Insulation when they turn the juice on.
Oh, yeah.
- There's a pair back here.
Where?
- Wait. You won't need any boots.
When it comes, go back.
You don't belong out here.
I didn't belong at Alamein or Okinawa.
I was just kibitzing.
I also write a very good obituary.
Just ignore me, please.
Capt. Hendry.
- Go ahead.
Just hooked this up.
Checking if it works.
Fine. Watch your Geiger counter.
Mac, did you hear?
- Every word. I hope that's all I hear.
So do I.
- Here's another message from Washington.
'Use every means to protect lives, but take no steps against your prisoner.'
Our prisoner.
You can't ignore orders.
- Testify to that at my court-martial.
You're robbing science of the greatest secret that's ever come to it.
Go back.
- Knowledge is more important than life.
We've only one excuse for existing.
To think. To find out. To learn.
What can we learn from that, except a way to die?
It doesn't matter what happens.
Nothing counts except our thinking.
We fought into nature.
We've split the atom...
That sure made the world happy.
Didn't it?
We owe it to the brain of our species to stand here and die...
...without destroying a source of wisdom.
- Capt. Hendry.
Civilization has given us orders.
- Get him out of here.
Oh, you fools. You'll never hurt it.
Go ahead.
- I'm getting a Geiger counter reaction.
What's your reading?
- Point two, but steady.
Watch it. Tell us any change.
Mac, anything your way?
Not a glimmer.
- Watch it.
Here's the operating switch.
How can it get cold so quick?
- Keep moving around.
It must be zero.
- It was. Next stop, five below.
Come on, Mr. Martian, and get some nice Scotch blood. One hundred proof.
Nothing like it for babies.
- Tell him to cut it out.
No, no. Let him go on. I like goose pimples. They keep me warm.
Did you get a picture of that thing on fire?
No. I shot one while I was falling backward over the bed.
Probably got the ceiling and my big feet.
Capt. Hendry, going up a little.
Point four now.
Hang on. Mac, any change?
- Just the same. Only colder.
Means he's coming by the mess hall.
- Excuse me. I got an idea.
What?
- Here we go again.
Your boy's pretty smart. He might see these wires and think it over.
Yeah.
- If he thinks too long, we're cold meat.
What if we met him by the junction?
- Let him see us there and chase us?
The less light, the better.
Turn off this light and this one here.
Don't tell me I'm right.
Capt. Hendry, going up.
Point eight now.
I'm getting some too.
- It's showing here.
Both of you, back here. Come running.
- Halfway there.
If you speed up that generator, can you get more out?
Certainly do no harm to try.
- Bill and Tex, go with him. Nikki too.
No.
- Good luck to you.
What's the matter?
I was wishing we'd tested this thing.
- What if we haven't enough voltage?
Keep swinging at its arms.
- One point two.
It's on its way.
- I got a worry.
Report from the front,
McPherson has a worry.
This is no joke.
- What?
What if he can read our minds?
- He'll be mad when he gets to me.
One point four.
- Keep moving around, you guys.
Keep it quiet.
I remember the first execution I ever covered. Ruth Snyder and Judd Grey.
Did you get a picture?
- No. They didn't allow cameras.
One point six and going up.
- Don't move till he sees us.
Give him a chance to look.
Leave me room to reach that switch.
Stay away from the walls when he hits the juice.
Everybody got rubber boots on?
- Yes, sir.
One point eight.
I heard something.
It's getting near the top.
Get your posts!
All right. Ease back.
What the...?
- The juice is off!
Carrington's turned off the generator.
Bob, bring a flashlight. Eddie, hold him off as long as you can.
Watch out. He's got a gun.
- Keep away. Keep away.
Keep away. I won't allow you to destroy...
Turn on that generator!
Get back here, Eddie.
Eddie, get back!
Stay away from that wire!
I'm your friend. I have no weapons.
I'm your friend.
You're wiser than I. You must understand what I'm trying to tell you.
Don't go farther. They'll kill you.
They think you'll harm us.
But I want to know you, to help you. Believe that.
You're wiser than anything on earth.
Use that intelligence. Look and know what I'm telling you.
I'm not your enemy.
I'm a scientist who's trying...
Hold it.
Wait until he gets right in the middle of it, sir.
He's gotta be on that walk, captain.
Wait till he gets right in the middle, sir.
Oh, that's it. Stop. Turn it off.
- Let it go. We don't want any part left.
Well, you can get a picture now, Scotty.
This will take a minute to warm up.
- Okay.
Is there any reason now why I can't send my story?
Only take five minutes.
- I guess it's okay.
You're looking better to me than you used to.
All done, Pat.
- Get everything?
Burned everything in Carrington's lab and the greenhouse.
Burned the arm too.
- How is Dr. Carrington?
He's got a broken collarbone and a headache.
I'm not getting enough voltage.
I'll check the generator for you.
- Good.
Anybody want some coffee?
- No, but you can come in.
You better have some. You look tired.
- He should look tired.
He's had two things on his mind.
- We've only had one.
Our worries are over, while our captain...
- Shut up.
Isn't there something you can do about it, Nikki?
I don't know. You know, I'm getting pretty fed up with the North Pole.
How much does a captain make?
- Not much.
That's a good start. Go ahead.
Enough to support two?
- Not nearly.
Captain, you get flight pay.
- Some for each dependent.
We can handle that.
- I won't be railroaded into anything.
I've got an idea.
This is gonna work.
- You ought to settle down.
There you are.
- It'd be much better for us.
Sure. Our captain always getting into trouble.
Remember that night in Honolulu?
- That was pretty bad.
I don't know what they're talking about.
- He should light somewhere.
See, they know what's best for you.
- Here we are. Plenty of voltage now.
Anchorage, from Polar Expedition 6.
Can you hear me? Over.
Anchorage, reception clear. Stand by.
- Press the button and speak, Scotty.
Tell General Fogarty we've sent for
Capt. Hendry. He'll be here in minutes.
Roger. Over.
- Are there any newsmen there? Over.
The place is full of them. Over.
- All right. Here's your story.
North Pole, November 3rd.
Ned Scott reporting.
One of the world's greatest battles was fought and won by the human race.
A handful of American soldiers and civilians...
...met the first invasion from another planet.
A man by the name of Noah once saved our world with an ark of wood.
Here, a few men performed a similar service with an arc of electricity.
A flying saucer, which landed here, and its pilot have been destroyed.
But not without casualties among our own meager forces.
I'd like to bring to the microphone the men responsible for our success.
But Capt. Hendry is attending to demands over and above the call of duty.
Dr. Carrington, leader of the scientific expedition...
...is recovering from wounds from the battle.
- Good for you.
And now, before giving you the details of the battle, I bring you a warning.
Every one of you listening to my voice...
...tell the world. Tell this to everybody wherever they are:
Watch the skies everywhere.
Keep looking. Keep watching the skies.
But not without casualties among our own meager forces.

Beware of the Blob
It creeps and leaps

Right through the door and all around the wall
A splotch, a blotch

No.
Well, it's a shooting star.
I thought you were supposed to wish on shooting stars.
- But I did.
- We only saw one.
- But you see a lot of 'em up here at night.
- What?
Well, I mean, there'sa lot of 'em out at night.
You don't see 'em in town.
That's why I come up here.
Oh, no, that's not what I mean.
- I mean, you can see 'em better up here...
- I know what you mean, Steve.
No, no, it's not what you think, 
Janey girl.
My name is Jane.
Just Jane.
For a little while, I thought that "shooting star" business wasn't just part of your line.
But it's not, Janey gir...
Jane, I've never brought anyone up here before.
Never?
Never.
Well, I may be crazy, but... 
I believe you.
Well, you're not crazy.
Boy, that was close!
Come on. 
I want to see if I can find it.
Shut up.
Get back inside.
Get back in there.
Huh. Huh.
I could've sworn it landed just over this hill.
Maybe it's like lightning. Sometimes you think it's striking right next door, and it's really miles away.
No, I still think it's close by.
Well, do you want to go back and try the other road?
No. Um... um... well, I'm sorry about the bumpy ride.
It's all right, Steve.
Well, listen, why don't we go back to town and I'll apologize.
I'll apologize over a sandwich.
I mean, on me.
- Okay?
- Okay.
Steve, watch out!
- What was that?
- It looked like an old man.
Where'd he go?
Hey, you okay?
Oh! Take me to a doctor!
- What's the matter?
- I can't get it off!
- Well, here, let me try. Maybe I can get it off.
- No! You can't!
Okay. Come on.
We'll get you in the car.
- Yeah, okay, get in.
- It hurts.
Take it easy, now.
Here, better put this on.
Take it easy.
We'll get you there as fast as we can.
Boy, I hope the doctor's in.
Mrs. Porter, Dr. Hallen.
I'm leaving now.
Yes, I'll be back tomorrow night, probably late.
No, I haven't forgotten anything.
Ye-Yes, I'll be fine.
Look, Mrs. Porter, if you'll just keep your eye on the house while I'm gone.
Thank you.
Good-bye.
Come on!
- Hey, who's the cowboy?
- That's no cowboy. That's Steve Andrews.
- What?
- Yeah, that's his container. It's a real dog.
Well, he can't do that to us.
Hey, Doc.
It's all right. Come on.
Watch his hand.
Hey, Doc Hallen, this man's been hurt.
Well, come on in.
Wanna get the door?
In there.
What's the matter with him?
I... I don't know.
He got something on his hand.
- What do you mean?
- Well, we ran into him down on the Old North Road.
- Ran into him?
- No, Doc, we picked him up out on the road.
He was screaming about this thing on his hand.
Let's take a look.
Take it easy, old-timer.
- What is it he's got on his hand?
- I don't know, Doc.
It was kind of like... well, a big blister on his fingers, you know?
Easy, now. Easy.
How are we gonna help you if you don't let us see it?
Doc! It's gotten bigger.
It was just on his hand before.
Cover him with this, please.
I've got to give him something.
Take it easy, old-timer.
Everything's gonna be all right.
- Steve, uh, you know who he is?
- Huh?
- Do you have any idea who he is?
- Oh, no, no.
All right, take it easy.
There we are.
- Steve.
- Huh?
Could you drive out to the place you found him?
See if you can find somebody that knows what happened.
Right. Right.
- Steve?
- Yeah?
Would you turn out the outside light when you go?
- I don't want to be disturbed.
- Sure, Doc. Sure.
What's up?
- Congratulations.
- Yeah? For what?
- "For what?" he says.
- Modest.
Mooch, quick, the crown.
Okay, I give up.
You just beat out the champion, pal.
A little while ago when you came into town.
Oh.
I get it. Well, thanks anyway, but you can keep the crown.
No, no, no.
Wait a minute, Steve.
You just can't stop being the champion like that.
You've gotta meet a challenger.
- You mean you?
- Me?
Did I say anything about a race, guys?
Huh?
Not a word.
All right, look, it's been a ball, you know? But I gotta go.
Yeah... we know how you go.
We're just not so sure you should drive around so fast.
Now look, I just don't have time to prove anything tonight. Do you understand?
Well, who's asking you to prove anything?
We can beat this kiddie car of yours going backwards.
Oh, that's a foregone transfusion.
Okay.
Now you're talkin', king.
And we'll do it just like you said.
- What did I say?
- Backwards.
Huh?
See if you could beat this kiddie car going backwards. 
- To the light.
- Okay. You say when.
Okay.
When!
I told you.
I got to leave now.
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh!
Steve.
All right, what's this all about?
Hi, Dave.
Hey, what's up, huh?
I seem to be missing something.
What's going on?
We're just sitting here waiting for the light.
Oh, you mean that light down there.
Yeah.
And you do know you're on the wrong side of the road?
I don't...
Would you think it was funny if your father... if Jane's father heard you were booked for reckless driving?
Okay, don't bring the fathers into this.
I'll never do it again.
- Do what again?
- Huh?
Do what again?
What-Whatever you think I'm doing, Dave.
Like driving on the wrong side of the road?
Well... yeah, yeah.
Or maybe even driving backwards?
Hey, Dave, that's an idea.
You know that 80 or 90 percent of the accidents are front-end jobs.
You know, in Australia they got airplanes... with the seats set in backwards... so in case you get a collision, they got... no concu...
No good, huh?
Okay... lock me up.
You mean, you were dri...
Why?
What am I gonna do with you kids?
You know I don't wanna haul you in.
No more foolin' around, Dave. 
No, I mean it.
I... swe... I promise.
Right, Jane? Huh?
- Right.
- See?
- No more horseplay.
- No more horseplay, Dave.
- No, no more fooling around.
- Get outta here.
Here they come.
Hey, what happened?
- Sergeant Bert?
- No, no, no. Dave.
- Oh, you're lucky it wasn't Bertsie.
- Yeah, you're not kidding.
- You don't know the half of it.
- What?
- Last night we seen Gig's car parked in front of Nancy's. 
- Listen to this.
So we decided we'd move it, hide it on him.
So we're moving it down the center of the street...
When along comes Sgt. Bert.
So Mooch tells him we can't get it started, you know?
He says, "I don't care. You're blocking traffic. 
Move it out of the way."
So then he gets out of the car, comes over to us... and he's helping us move Gig's car.
Just then, Gig comes out of the house... and he's yelling,
"Who's stealing my car?"
- I thought Bertie would drop his teeth.
- I bet he did.
If Gig didn't cover for us, we would've been in trouble.
Yeah, you know, I'd sure hate to cross Bertie again tonight.
Hey, what happened with you and Dave?
I got a lecture.
Promised to be a good boy.
You know, Dave's a good guy. I think we have been steaming him up a little too much.
There's about two inches of rubber on the street outside Doc's house.
Hey, I almost forgot.
I gotta do something for the doc.
- What?
- I gotta go up and check on some people.
- You wanna come with me?
- Oh, no, man. We're going to the flicks.
- At this time of night?
- Yeah, it's a midnight spook bit.
We got some rumors there'd be some unprotected women in the balcony.
Well, listen, why don't you...
Come on, come with us.
You can go to the movies after.
It'll only take a half hour.
- Come on!
- It's okay with me.
- All right, man, lead the way.
- Okay.
Groverton 4771.
Hello.
Is Dr. Gilpen there?
Dr. Hallen.
Oh, he has?
No, no message.
Thanks. Good-bye.
Hello? 
Kate? Dr. Hallen.
I'm still at the office.
Something's come up. I'll need your help right away. No, you've got to come back.
There's a man here with some sort of a parasite on his arm.
It's assimilating his flesh at a frightening speed.
I may have to get ahead of it and amputate.
No, I... I don't know what it is or where it came from.
Man, look at that, will you?
- What is it?
- Wow, I don't know.
Tony, look.
- Hey, what landed here?
- We must be getting close to the front line.
Hey, why would anybody leave a lantern here?
- I don't know.
- What is it, Steve?
- It's hot.
- Watch it.
- A shooting star?
- Hey, we saw that too!
A real big one, like a skyrocket.
- Oh, yeah, about an hour ago.
- You think this is it?
- I don't know.
- Let me see.
Wow, a real piece of sky.
Here, Mooch.
You mean that this little pebble has been out there hot-roddin' around the universe?
Probably big as the moon when it started.
No kiddin'!
Let me see it, Mooch.
And this is all that's left?
Well, it's all that's here.
I'll bet there is a house close by.
Doesn't sound like a house.
It sounds like a dog.
- Come on, Steve. Let's go look.
- Yeah, sure.
Hey, wait a minute.
Hey, there's a house.
- Hey, real nice.
- You think anybody's here?
Hello? Hello? Doesn't look like there's anybody here at all.
Hey, I can't see anything but just that little dog.
Oh, Steve, open the door and let him out.
Okay. Come on.
- Come on. Come on.
- Come on. Come on.
- Come on, pal.
- Come on. Ohhh. Come on out.
- Doesn't look like anybody was there at all.
- Come on.
I guess it's the old man's dog.
Don't you worry, baby.
You'll be all right.
- Think this is the place?
- It sure looks like it.
This is a cozy spot. 
No neighbors, no cars, no roads, no lights.
Yeah, and no movies.
Come on, you guys, let's get outta here.
Let's go, Mooch.
I guess there's nothing else you can find out here, Steve. 
No, no, I guess not.
Why don't you come with us to the spooky show, huh? You'd like it.
- No, no thanks.
- Ah, you gotta stop takin' everything so serious-like.
Gotta live a little.
You gotta go, you know?
Yeah, Steve, you gotta hang loose, like me.
- Okay, sure, the spook show.
- Come on.
- Let's go, you guys!
- Yeah, comin'.
- Steve?
- Yeah.
- What about the dog?
- I don't know.
I mean, we can't just leave him here.
He'd starve to death.
- Yeah, that's right.
- Couldn't we take him with us?
Sure. I guess that's the least we could do for the old man. Come on, let's go.
Oh, hello, Kate.
Thanks for coming back.
It's okay.
What do you want me to do?
You better take his pulse. 
But don't touch that material on his right hand.
It absorbs flesh on contact, like an acid.
Doctor, where is he?
What do you mean?
Kate, stand still. Don't move.
It must have absorbed the old man completely.
I don't know what this is, but it's got to be killed before it gets any bigger.
- Oh, Doctor, I'm afraid.
- Try to stay as far away from it as you can.
Kate, be calm! 
Now do as I say.
Behind you.
The trichloroacetic acid.
- Throw it!
- Throw it?
Yes, but for heaven's sake, don't get any of it on your hands.
Doctor, nothing will stop it.
A gun. In my den.
I've got to go for it, Kate.
Now try to stay absolutely still.
- Don't go. Don't leave me.
- I'll be right back.
Doctor, come back!
Come back!
Kate, what's the matter?
Kate! Kate, what is it?
Kate!
Kate!
Listen, you stay there, and I'll go in and tell the doc.
- It doesn't look like there's anybody here.
- Yeah.
Well, maybe he took the old man to the hospital. 
Anyway, I'll check.
Okay.
Listen, I'm gonna check in the garage and see if the doc's car is there.
Oh, okay.
Steve. Steve, what's the matter?
Steve, tell me what happened.
- I can't.
- Well, what happened?
- It was so...
- Steve, what is it?
- It's got the doc. It's got...
- What's the matter with him?
Just like the thing on the old man's hand, only it was bigger.
Then it was on his whole head, and then in just a second he disappeared.
- He disappeared?
- He was all gone. He was all gone.
- You know, he just disappeared.
- Steve, what are you talking about?
I'm sorry.
Get in the car, Jane.
Well, what are you gonna do, Steve?
We're gonna go to the police.
They'll know what to do.
Well, we can get someone over there tomorrow. Yeah.
- We'll have someone over there first thing in the morning.
- Well, what's this?
Hey, watch it, Dave.
Don't mix up the pieces.
Ritchie, you old buzzard.
I didn't know you were a chess player.
It's like I've been telling you, Dave.
You're not the only thinker around here.
It's nothing.
Just a hobby, you know?
Well, wait. Wait a minute. I think this is interesting. 
Who do you play with?
Well, late at night when I'm here by myself and things are pretty slow, I...
Well, you gotta do something.
You oughta take up chess.
Loosen up your gray matter a little.
I guess I'd better.
You'll have to teach me, Ritchie.
Sure, Dave.
Anytime.
Dave, Doc Hallen's been killed.
- Doc Hallen? What happened?
- You gotta come now!
Wait a minute, Steve.
Tell us what happened.
I'm trying to tell you.
Now this thing, it killed the doc.
What was it?
Out with it, kid.
Well, it's kind of like a ma...
It's kind of like a mass that keeps getting bigger and bigger.
- Come on, Steve, make sense.
- I know, I know.
Look, Dave, you gotta see this thing to believe what I'm telling you.
Maybe the thing you saw was a... monster?
Yeah, maybe it was.
I don't know.
Hold on, Jim.
Now, what is it, Steve?
A little while ago it was driving backwards, and now it's monsters.
Look, he's not making it up, Dave. 
Honest.
Dave, I'm not kidding. Come on over to the doc's.
You can see it for yourself.
You're crazy if you go.
Can't you see it's a gag?
He says Doc Hallen's dead, Jim.
We've got to check it out.
Let's go.
Ritchie, you mind the store.
Dave, listen...
East Cornwall, Downingtown H.Q.
Downingtown, East Cornwall H.Q.
Q to K-2.
Do I read you right?
Q to K-2?
Roger.
K-9 to KB-5.
Shucks.
"This office will be closed all day Saturday. 
Dr. Hallen."
- Wait a minute.
- What's the matter?
The thing might be in there waiting for you.
- Well, we'll have to take that chance, won't we?
- I'm not kidding.
Dr. Hallen?
Dr. Hallen?
Hmm. Seems to be a short circuit in here.
You got your light?
Everything looks okay.
There. I think this is the room 
I saw him in.
- It's locked.
- I'll see if I can find a key that'll work.
No, the key's already here.
It's been locked from the inside.
Hello?
Who's in there?
Better go around and see if the window's unlocked.
If it isn't, break the glass, come in and unlock the door.
- All right.
- You're not gonna let him do that.
Now, don't worry, Steve. 
Sergeant Bert knows how to handle himself.
And this is the only way to get to the bottom of this.
- I'll see if I can find the fuse box.
- Okay.
Steve, I wonder where the little dog is.
Yeah.
What do you think happened to him?
I don't know.
Well, that's more like it.
This must have been what blew the fuse.
Jim?
Wait till you get a load of this mess!
Ohh.
What about this, Steve?
I don't know, Dave.
But I know I saw the doc.
All right, kid, cut the act.
What really happened here?
- I don't know.
- All of a sudden, your mind is a blank?
- No.
- Steve, are you sure this is the room?
Yes, I'm sure of it.
This has been fired.
But I haven't seen any shot marks around anyplace.
Let me tell you what happened, kid.
You and whoever else was in on this thought you'd put one over on the police.
- So you break in here, you mess the place up...
- Wait a minute, Jim.
The kids couldn't have done this.
You saw for yourself.
The window was locked from the inside, and so was the door.
They rigged it with string. 
It's part of their plan to make us look silly.
I think you're doing that pretty well by yourself, Sergeant.
Steve, was there anybody else with you?
No.
How about when I stopped you over on Morgan Street?
Those kids had nothing to do with this.
- Who were they?
- Why, it was Tony and Mooch.
Those kids? 
Well, there's your answer right there!
They're just the kind of kids to pull a trick like this.
- But this time they've gone too far.
- What goes on out here?
- Land's sakes!
- What are you doing here, Mrs. Porter?
Boy oh boy oh boy! 
Wait till Doctor gets back and sees this!
- Back from where?
- Lieutenant, was it burglars?
We don't know yet.
Where is Dr. Hallen?
Johnsonville.
A medical convention.
You know, I told him this would happen one of these days, the way he leaves everything unlocked.
Of course, it was my fault too.
He asked me to keep an eye on the place.
But that's not true, Dave.
He never left.
I don't think I've had the pleasure.
This is Steve Andrews, Mrs. Porter.
He seems to think the doctor got into some trouble here tonight.
No, sir! 
The doctor don't know anything about this.
He called me just before he left.
He didn't leave. Look, Dave,
I'll bet his car is still in the garage.
Might be. Doctor sometimes goes in somebody else's car.
Dr. Gilpen from over in Groverton.
- Jim, call Dr. Gilpen.
- Right.
- He won't be home.
- Just checking.
Mrs. Porter, did you hear any gunshots tonight?
I sure did!
Tonight and every other night.
The people downstairs have those old movies on their television.
There's always some shooting or screaming.
Whoever this thief was, he didn't have to tear up the place like this.
I feel terrible.
Wait a minute, Mrs. Porter.
I don't want this touched.
Well, I don't want the doctor to come back tomorrow and find the place like this.
- It's bad enough the window's broke and all.
- But, Mrs. Porter...
Now, you boys have your work to do, and I have mine.
There's a criminal walking around out there free as a bird.
You go get him.
Let me clean up here.
Mrs. Porter, you don't understand.
We may want to check here for fingerprints later.
Dr. Gilpen's on his way to Johnsonville.
Did he pick up Dr. Hallen?
I spoke with Mrs. Gilpen, and she said that Dr. Hallen had called around 11:00, just after her husband left, but she thought they were going together.
- Where can we reach them in Johnsonville?
- I didn't ask her that.
St. John's Hotel.
That's where the doctor usually stays.
Well, they should be there in a couple of hours.
We'll leave word to have him call us when he checks in.
Can't I just dust around the fingerprints?
Tomorrow.
Well, let's go, kids.
Dave, this is all wrong.
All right, kid, the show's over. 
It was a cute act, but this time it didn't work.
This locked door business really hung you.
If everything happened like you said, where's the doctor?
And where is this old man?
And where is the big, bad monster?
I don't know.
Hand me that small hammer, will ya?
- Why don't you finish that tomorrow?
- I ain't gonna be here.
I'm goin' on a huntin' trip.
I didn't know you was a hunter.
Neither did I.
We got a little cabin up in the south woods, the boys and me.
And I'm tellin' you, Marty boy, we're goin' up there this weekend, and I'm gonna get so roarin', stinkin', no-good drunk...
I won't be able to see.
Hey, why don't you come with us?
It'll do you some good.
Oh, I don't think Martha would figure it that way.
Do you have to tell your old woman everything? 
Tell her your uncle died.
Tell her you're going away so you can love her more when you get back.
Good night.
Boy, I'm so tired of lookin' at the guts of secondhand cars...
I could spit grease.
You know, Marty, if I didn't get away once in a while, I'd blow a gasket.
When I come in on Monday, if Mr. Johnson looks at me funny just once... just once... you know what
I'm gonna do to him, Marty?
Hey, Marty!
Look, you keep telling me about a monster.
- All I want to do is clear this thing up.
- All right, I agree.
- But I still don't see why you had to call our folks.
- Dave, it's for you.
- What else could I do?
- Well, give us a chance to find out what happened.
You know we didn't tear up Doc's house.
How long have you known me?
All right, I believe you!
But I still don't think you're telling me all you know.
- Oh, Dave.
- Hello? Yeah.
Well, young lady, do you mind telling me where you've been spending the evening?
- Daddy, it's all right.
- Oh, yes, everything's fine.
I always stop by the police station to pick up my daughter.
Don't you realize what this could do to me?
By morning, it will be all over town.
We were just trying to warn people.
After all, I am principal of the high school.
Young man, this is the last time you're ever going to take my daughter out!
Steve didn't do anything wrong!
Mr. Andrews, can you make anything out of all this? I can't.
Take it easy, Mr. Martin. 
We'll straighten everything out. Hello, son.
- Dad, I saw something terrible tonight.
- And nobody'll believe us.
Mr. Martin, Mr. Andrews, uh, apparently Doc Hallen's office was broken into by vandals tonight.
And Steve and Jane seem to know something about it.
Vandals?
My daughter?
Well, you don't think our kids were mixed up in it, do you?
All we know is that they told us something had happened over at Dr. Hallen's house.
We're not accusing anyone of what we found.
We can't be more definite until we contact Dr. Hallen in Johnsonville.
Dad, it isn't vandalism!
Dr. Hallen is dead, and he was killed by some sort of a monster.
Now, I know because I saw it, Dad.
Lieutenant, I want you to know that Steve is not in the habit of telling lies.
If he says he's not mixed up in this vandalism, you can be sure it's the truth.
Did you see this thing too, Jane?
Well... no, not exactly.
Well, look, folks, we'll all know more in the morning after we've called Johnsonville.
I think the best thing now is for all of us to go home and get some sleep.
Maybe it's a good idea, son. 
We can talk about this some more at home.
Sure, Pop.
Get out of the house as fast as you can.
I'll be over.
Maybe Bertie's right.
Maybe this is just a gag like those school fraternities were throwing last year.
Remember how they stitched that bathing suit to the statue of General Hayes?
I don't think this is a gag.
Why didn't you book the kids then?
Why make a big thing of it tonight if we can clear the whole thing up tomorrow?
Boy, if it was Bertie, he'd have them strung up by the thumbs by now.
Maybe he would.
Police department.
Hold on. It's Bertie.
- Hello?
- Dave? 
Yep.
A couple of people thought they heard shots, but weren't sure. 
- Okay, Jim. Doc's place locked up?
- Yeah.
- Check back in, then.
- Right.
We'll get the truth out of those kids if it takes all night.
- I sent the kids home.
- Home? Are you crazy?
Jim, we'll take care of this whole thing tomorrow.
Yes, sir.
Is that all?
Yes, that's all.
Bertie got some idea what this is?
I don't care what Bertie's ideas are!
He acts like we're still fighting the war.
Just because some kid smacks into his wife on the turnpike... doesn't make it a crime to be 17 years old!
Okay, so I don't know what the kids are up to tonight.
But I'm not gonna throw them into a cell like a couple of vagrants.
We'll put this puzzle together in the morning.
In the meantime, at least we know where the kids are.
- Hey, where are you going?
- Oh, shhh, Danny.
- Shhh.
- Where are you going?
I've got something very important to do, Danny, but it's got to be a secret.
I won't tell anybody.
I'll go with you.
No, honey, I have to go by myself.
- Will you be back pretty soon?
- Well, I don't know.
Aren't you afraid to go out by yourself?
Yes, I guess I am, Danny.
I'm not afraid.
I'll guard you.
Oh, no, Danny.
You've got a bigger job to do.
You've got to stay here and guard Mommy and Daddy.
Oh, they don't need guarding.
Oh, look, Danny, go on to beddie.
Look, if you go to bed, 
I might bring you a little dog all your very own.
A dog! Honest?
Honest.
I cross my heart.
- Oh, boy!
- Now go on up to bed.
- What's his name?
- Oh, any name you want, Danny.
Can I name him William?
Oh, that's a fine name, Danny.
Now you better run on up to bed.
- Go on.
- Oh, I don't like William.
You run on to bed, honey.
Steve? Steve?
- Was he asleep?
- Yeah.
Do you think he did something wrong?
I don't know. I don't think so.
The police don't either, or they wouldn't have sent him home.
I felt that he was keeping something from us.
He did seem more willing to talk when we were at the police station.
Well, I think tomorrow he might talk and we'll be able to straighten this out.
Maybe, after a good night's sleep.
Yeah. Good night.
'Night, dear.
You scared me to death.
What are you doing here?
Listen, Jane, 
I told you to wait over there.
The folks went to bed, so I thought I should just come on over.
All right, come on.
Let's go around the corner.
- Steve?
- Huh?
Oh, I'm sorry.
At least I could've thanked you for coming out tonight. 
You didn't need to.
I never needed to talk to anyone before, not as much as I do now.
Well, we're in this together, aren't we, Steve?
You know, I wish that we...
I must be getting confused.
I know we saw the old man,
I know we took him to the doc's... and I know the doc sent us out to see if we could find out what happened.
So?
And I know the old man had something on his hand, something he couldn't get off, something that kept getting larger.
I saw that.
And then I...
I think I saw the doc.
He was standing by the window, and he... he was trying to get out... and that thing was all over him... and then... just dissolved while I stood there.
I think I saw this.
I believe you did.
You know, plenty of people in their right mind thought they saw things that didn't exist, you know, like flying saucers.
The light was just right, and the angle and the imagination.
Boy, if that's what it is, then this is just an ordinary night.
You and I are gonna go to sleep, and tomorrow when we get up... that sun's gonna shine, just like yesterday.
Good old yesterday.
Steve, well, you believe you did see it, don't you?
I don't know. I-I...
That's not true, Steve.
Well, maybe, maybe now you don't want to believe it.
Maybe you'd like to tell yourself it didn't happen.
But, Steve, you're not the kind of person who can turn your back... on something you know is true.
I don't know.
Well, you actually did see what happened to Dr. Hallen.
How do you know I did?
Because I know you.
Okay.
Now what do we do?
How do you get people to protect themselves from something they don't believe in?
Well, you keep trying and hoping you can find... some sort of proof that'll convince them.
Okay.
I don't like it much, but I guess the only way you can find that is to go out and look for it.
I'll go get the car.
- You sure you want to go with me?
- Yes.
I wouldn't give much for our chances... wandering around in the middle of the night trying to find something... that if we found it, it might kill us.
If we could only find a couple of people to help us.
Hmm. Who?
Well, your friends,
Tony, Mooch and Al.
Hey, you know, that... that's worth a try.
Yes, I am here, 
the demon who possesses your soul.
Wait a bit.
I am coming for you.
I have so much to show you.
Tony, listen, I wanna see you outside.
Hey, what gives? 
I thought you cats didn't dig spooky shows.
This is important.
Outside.
- Hey, what's up?
- Shhh.
I'll explain outside.
This is important.
You missed most of the picture.
You're not gonna get your money's worth.
None of us are, unless somebody keeps quiet.
You're gotta come with us.
There's nobody else we can go to.
- Okay, you kids, knock it off.
- Come on!
What?
Walk out of the movie?
Let's cut out.
You cats gonna make it?
Not me. I'm part of this chair, and I can't move.
Tsk.
Hold up, Mooch!
Hey, all right, Steve, you made us waste our 80 cents. Now, what gives?
Yeah, what's the scoop?
What's the big idea, Steve?
Would you believe me if I told you there was something inside of that rock we found, something that could wipe out this whole town?
Knock it off!
Go ahead, Steve.
I saw this thing kill Dr. Hallen tonight.
Kill Dr. Hallen?
- That's right.
- Well, what is it?
I don't know.
But one thing's for sure, if it can kill Dr. Hallen, it can kill somebody else.
What do you want us to do, Steve?
All right, we're gonna find this thing, and we're gonna make people believe us.
Let's try Johnsonville again, Ritchie.
- Okay.
- I just saw a strange one.
What do you mean?
On my way back here, 
I ran into Mr. Connors coming outta that bar... in the building he owns over on Second Street.
He'd just stopped in, and there was nobody there.
Queerest thing I've ever seen.
TV was playin' away. The cash register was there with the money still in it.
Nobody around.
No bartender, nobody.
I'll look in there on the way home.
Forget it. 
The place is all locked up now.
Why don't you go home and get some shut-eye?
You can't run our shift and yours too, you know?
Yeah, I know. I wish I knew where those two doctors were, though.
- Any luck, Ritchie?
- Nope, they're not there.
Want me to call the other hotels?
There's a lot of them between here and Johnsonville.
No. I guess you're right. I guess there's nothing here that won't wait till morning.
Well, I'll see you guys.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Well, hello, kids!
Come on in!
You're just in time for the fun.
- We came to warn you.
- Huh? How?
- We came here just to warn you...
- Oh, a warning!
Well, that's fine.
I didn't know you cared.
Hey, folks!
I want you to meet Paul Revere, and this is Mrs. Revere.
They've come to give us a warning about something important.
The British are coming!
Excuse me.
We were just... just looking for a monster.
Monsters? You must've been talking to that guy from Second Street.
Man, I don't know what they're serving over there, but it sure must be great stuff.
Listen, we're trying to tell you.
We don't wanna get served.
Look, I have monsters in here all the time, so beat it.
We don't serve kids anyway.
Where is he?
Over there, in the doorway of your dad's store.
- Come on. Come on.
- Come on. Hey!
That's funny.
The door's not locked.
Do you think it's been open all night?
Well, I don't know.
This is Friday.
The store closes at 10:00, and then old Mr. Weinermeyer sweeps up... and then he collects all the push carts.
Huh. He works around for a couple of hours before he locks up, but I'm sure he'd never be this late, not...
Hey, Mr. Weinermeyer?
Hey, Mr. Weinermeyer, where are you?
I'm gonna turn on the light.
Steve, what is it?
I don't know. Oh.
It's a broom and stuff that Mr. Weinermeyer cleans up with.
It's spread all over the aisle.
What's the matter? Jane!
Here. You all right?
Yes.
Steve!
Oh, Steve, our parents!
They think we're home in bed asleep, sound and safe.
Steve, it's the little dog!
Now listen! Everything's gonna be all right. 
Do you hear me? Now...
It's gonna be all right.
I don't know if we can stop that thing.
- The dog, Steve.
- Take it easy, Jane.
- Oh, Steve, the little dog!
- Don't cry, Jane.
There's nothing we can do about it.
Now, Jane, just put this on.
It'll be all right.
Oh, Steve, what are we gonna do?
I don't know.
That thing probably isn't far away.
We've gotta get out of here before it comes back for us.
Now, come on.
All right?
There they are! 
- Hey, where you kids been?
- Hey, it's in there!
- You're kidding!
- I wish I were kidding. It's in there.
- He got the little dog.
- Oh, you mean the old man's dog.
- We just seen him running down the street.
- Oh, Steve!
- What do we do now?
- We're gonna call the police. They want evidence.
There's a phone at the corner!
- Hmm.
- Go on!
- You talk to him, Tony.
- Me? Why me?
I'm supposed to be home asleep.
If they think I'm loose, they'll never believe us.
Yeah, here's a dime.
Come on. Come on.
- Hey, what'll I say?
- Ask for Dave.
And you give it to him straight. 
You tell him to get out to the store quick.
Tell him to bring every piece of hardware he can find in the police station.
Hello. Police department.
Is... Who's this?
Arthur who?
Is every kid in town in on this?
I don't know who this is, but you're going to wish you'd never thought of this.
Hello? Hello?
Big deal!
I'd like to take that dime...
- Bert?
- Yeah.
Wouldn't you know it?
All right, we tried to do it the right way, now we're gonna wake this town up ourselves.
- Yeah, yeah, but how?
- Yeah, how?
Any way we can think of.
We've got to stop being a baby-sitting service and start being a police department.
- Just kids, Jim.
- Just kids?
That's about he craziest argument 
I've ever heard.
Every criminal in the world was a kid once. 
What does it prove?
You know what I think?
I think they've got it in for me.
- You?
- Yeah.
They've heard about my war record, and it bugs them.
They're trying to break me down, see what makes me tick.
Anything they can try, they try.
Aw, I don't think so, Jim.
- What the...
- Sounds like New Year's Eve.
Hello?
I don't know either...
Lady?
Police department.
Looks like everybody in town's getting up.
What's going on here?
Why, that's an air raid!
Pull yourself together.
Oh, it's probably only...
No, maybe it's the real thing.
It isn't a drill.
Where is my civil defense helmet?
Where is it?
Here we are.
Here we go.
- Fire.
- Fire?
This has never happened before.
What am I gonna wear?
Henry, Danny's gone!
What?
And Jane too!
- Calm down, Elizabeth.
- I looked in their rooms. They're both gone!
- Are you sure?
- Yes! Yes!
Well, maybe they're down here.
Here's Danny.
Danny!
What are you doing here?
I'm guarding you.
Guarding us?
Guarding us against what, darling?
I don't know.
Has everyone in this fool town gone crazy?
Danny, do you know where Janey is?
She's just gone.
I'm going to get to the bottom of this right now.
Come, Elizabeth.
Hey, what's going on here?
What's the matter?
All right now, kill the ho...
Kill the horns!
All right, knock off the noise now!
Listen to... Listen to me!
Now listen to me, everybody!
This town is in danger.
Several people have been killed already.
Now we had to make this noise so you'd listen to us, so we could warn you.
If we're in trouble, where are the police?
You! Boy, this time you've really hung yourself.
Now look... Now look, sarge, just give me a chance to talk to them, that's all.
I don't know what kind of a game it is you're playing, but whatever it is it's gonna stop right now!
Here comes Dave.
What's going on here, Jim? 
Steve!
Dave, make 'em listen to me!
There is a monster!
We saw it again in Dad's store.
Dave, it's bigger now.
Your story's gotten bigger now, kid.
Dave, look at me! Do I look like somebody who's playing a practical joke?
Am I laughing... or am I scared stiff?
- What are you gonna do?
- He's telling the truth.
Oh, wait a minute! It's one thing to make a fool out of yourself, but it's another thing to make a fool out of the police department and the town.
- He's right, Lieutenant.
- You've been wrong before.
Maybe I have! But as long as I'm in charge of this town's police force,
I'm gonna handle this thing the way I see fit.
And your job right now is to help me restore some order around here.
Yes, sir.
Okay, everybody, quiet down a minute.
Quiet down, please!
Listen, this is an emergency, and it can affect every one of us.
That's all I can tell you right now.
But we're trying to get things under control.
In order to do that, we have to clear this area immediately.
So please go home and stay there.
We'll keep in touch with you through your radio station.
Now, be careful pulling your cars out of this area.
Go home slowly and quietly.
Just keep calm.
Everything's gonna be all right.
- Anything I can do to help?
- Lieutenant, what's going on?
Ask your daughter, Mr. Martin.
She can tell you more than I can.
Phil, can your boys give us a hand clearing this area? 
Sure.
- Do you have any guns?
- A couple of 'em.
- Get 'em.
- Say, Dave, what is this thing?
I don't know. But if it's in the market, we'll all know in a few minutes.
Now all the images of horror,
the demons of your mind crowd in on you to destroy you.
Phil, can you move your truck over to the door... and shine your big light into the market?
- Sure, Dave.
- All right.
What the...
Hey, who's in the store?
Huh?
There's nobody in here but us monsters.
Dave, it's at the theater!
Don't go in, Jim.
This won't do any good.
It's the most horrible thing
I've ever seen in my life.
- So what is it?
- Come on, we've gotta clear this area.
All right, step back!
Everybody step back!
Here it comes!
Danny!
No, Danny, wait!
What goes?
What happened out there?
Oh, I almost got it.
No, Danny! Danny, we can't stay here.
Come with me, Danny.
Listen, it's too late.
Let's see if we can get out the back.
Wait a minute!
What's this?
- What happened?
- It's all over us.
- What do you mean? What's the matter?
- Take it easy!
Jim, get the telephone company. 
Have them connect you with the diner, fast.
I'm not gonna stay here!
Now, wait a minute!
You open that door, and we've had it!
- You wanna die?
- What are we supposed to do?
- Hello? Yeah.
- Steve?
- That thing is all over us!
- Watch out!
I don't think it can be killed.
- We've gotta try one more thing.
- Okay.
- Is everybody all right?
- Okay, but not for long.
We can drop a power line on it.
Do you understand?
There should be enough juice in that line to burn the thing to a crisp.
Yeah, get everyone down in the cellar.
We'll do it in 60 seconds, Steve.
Cellar!
Okay.
Jim, here's a rifle.
- Take the phone, Ritchie.
- All right.
Dave, this baby should do the trick.
It's all set to go.
Try not to miss, Jim.
Okay, let's have those lights!
Fifteen seconds.
It's quiet now.
I think the upstairs is clear.
Good. Keep your ear to that phone, Ritchie.
Okay, Jim.
It didn't work.
Why don't you do something?
Do something!
Elizabeth.
The diner's on fire.
Can't we put it out?
Any suggestions how?
Anyway, not enough oxygen in there to keep a fire going for ten minutes.
There's something burning.
- Listen, is there any other way out of here?
- The windows.
Hey, now you be quiet.
Shhh.
- I'm not afraid.
- Well, I know you're not.
Hey, listen, Jane...
It'll be all right.
Honey, lay your head down and try to go to sleep.
Everything will be all right, Danny.
Hey, there's the fire!
I'll stop it!
Wait a minute.
Let me have that a minute.
CO2! Hey, that's it!
It's cold!
That's why it didn't come in the ice box after us. 
It can't stand cold.
- You got any more of these things? Huh?
- No.
This thing's running out.
The phone. Hey, Dave!
Hey, Dave! Hey, Da...
Anybody on the phone?
Hey, Dave!
Dave, can you hear me?
CO2!
Dave!
- What did he say?
- Al, what's up?
Shhh. Quiet.
CO2?
Phil! Phil, do you got any CO2 extinguishers?
Not many.
Some soda acid.
Well, get the CO2s out here and start hitting around those cellar windows.
- What?
- Just do it, Phil!
And check these buildings for fire extinguishers. 
But only the CO2 kind.
- Bring back every one you can get your hands on.
- All right. Okay.
Hey, maybe we can help.
Let's get some guys together.
- Lieutenant, I know where there are 20 extinguishers
- Good. Where?
- At the high school. Who can go with me?
- Hey, right here, Mr. Martin.
Well, what are we waiting for? 
Let's go.
Okay, let's go.
Over here, Mr. Martin.
This thing's running out!
Hey, Dave! Dave?
Dave, CO2 fire extinguishers!
Dave, can you hear me?
CO2!
Okay, come on.
- Oh, it's locked.
- Of course it's locked.
- Here comes Mr. Martin.
- Here comes the principal.
We could only find four or five of these things, Dave.
- How many of them do you need?
- A lot more than that.
- Keep looking. It's all we can do.
- Okay.
Dave, Colonel Spaulding got me through to Washington.
They thought I was crazy at first, but they're getting someone now.
Hey, here come the kids!
Our power's still out, so we can't do much in the way of refrigeration.
We think we've got it under control, but we won't rest easy until it's frozen solid.
Now...
No, it's too big for that, and it's impossible to cut it.
No, sir, a bomb would spread it all over the country.
Look, this thing has killed probably 40 or 50 people since last night.
In a few hours, we're gonna have the sun overhead.
I think you should send us the biggest transport plane you have... and take this thing up to the Arctic or somewhere where it'll never thaw out.
Oh, Daddy! Oh, Daddy!
Let me see you, son.
Let me see my boy.
- Nice work, Steve. You okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.
Dave, listen, I wanna...
Well, I wanna thank you for getting us out of there.
You know, for a while,
I didn't think we were gonna make it.
- That makes two of us.
- What are they gonna do with that thing, Dave?
Well, the Air Force is sending a Globemaster in.
They're flying it to the Arctic.
It's not dead, is it?
No, it's not.
- Just frozen.
- I don't think it can be killed.
But at least we've got it stopped.
Yeah, as long as the Arctic stays cold.
Needles in a heavenly haystack.
There are more stars in the heavens than human beings on earth.
Through telescopes, men of science constantly search the infinitesimal corners of our solar system seeking new discoveries, hoping to better understand the laws of the universe.
Observatories dedicated to the study of astronomy often are set in high and remote places.
But there is none more remote than Mount Kenna Observatory in this part of South Africa.
If our calculations prove to be correct this will be the most frightening discovery of all time.
These two bodies have travelled almost a million miles in two weeks.
- Is that Randall?
- I hope so.
Stanley, I want Randall to leave as quickly as possible.
The plates are ready, catalogued and marked for identification.
- Here are tonight's plates.
- Good! lnclude them.
I told Professor Hendron
I'd send as much detail as we have.
Paul, Stanley, it won't be necessary to tell Randall what he's carrying.
ZS, MAP, Dave Randall from Johannesburg.
Cabin monoplane, request permission to land. Over.
Hello, Randall. This is Russ Curtis,
Mount Kenna Field.
Visibility fine. Take runway three.
Approach from southwest at 500.
There's a car waiting to take you to the observatory. Over...over.
Thank you, Mount Kenna Field!
- Hello, Randall.
- How are you, Stan?
You must have been held up.
We knew you arrived two hours ago.
I had a friend's aunt for a passenger to get home.
- I'm Emery Bronson.
- Hello, doctor.
- You've been well recommended.
- It shouldn't have taken much.
I understand all you want is a package delivered.
Did you bring your passport to the United States?
Yes. But who gets delivery of what?
Your recommendation said I could depend on a lack of curiosity.
I don't care what you're doing.
Just tell me where do I go
- and when I get paid.
- I didn't mean to be rude.
It's just that secrecy is very important now.
Fly to Lisbon, then take the transatlantic clipper to New York.
The delivery will be made to Dr Hendron at the Cosmos Observatory.
Here are several poses of Dr Hendron.
The delivery must be made to him personally.
- To Dr Hendron only.
- Right.
You'll require this for expenses.
I'm supposed to get $1,500 plus expenses.
Hendron will pay on delivery.
Time is all that counts.
The money doesn't matter at all.
With me, doctor, money always matters.
Perhaps now.
But the day may arrive when money won't mean anything.
Not to you, nor anyone.
When that happens to me,
I'll be six feet under.
Good luck, Randall.
There was another radiogram for you at the last stop.
Thank you.
- I hope you're enjoying your trip.
- It's very nice, thanks.
Honestly, the inspection takes longer than the trip across.
I brought Clara a few things.
She's so appreciative.
50% duty?
I'd rather junk the stuff right here.
I think that's the man, carrying the black box.
I'll see.
- David Randall?
- That's right.
May I see your passport, please?
Thank you.
Fine.
I'll handle this, Jim.
Give him his luggage.
That brown one over there.
Right this way, please.
- Here's your man.
- How do you do?
I'm Joyce Hendron,
Professor Hendron's daughter.
We're to go straight to the observatory.
This is better than a motorcycle escort.
You'll need a pass to get out of the building. The pass.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Right this way, Mr Randall.
Mr Randall. Mr Randall!
Mr Randall, I'm Donovan from "The Sentinel".
- Some other time.
- We've raised our offer. $7,500.
Here's a cheque to your order.
No thanks.
I'm working on a better offer.
I can't imagine how "The Sentinel" even had a hint about your errand.
But it's difficult to keep secrets from the newspapers.
I'm glad you turned them down.
You know what it would mean if the public had this information prematurely?
Of course.
We've been praying Dr Bronson is wrong - that these pictures will show some error in his calculations.
Don't you find yourself wishing...
Wouldn't you rather not know?.
No, it's better to know.
I wish I had your courage.
But I'm frightened.
As frightened as all those people would be if they knew.
I haven't the courage to face the end of the world.
Joyce!
- I'm glad you waited for me.
- So am I.
Tony, this is Mr Randall.
- How are you?
- How do you do?
Alice, didn't my father know
Dr Drake was here?
I told Alice not to bother him.
He's in a meeting of the observatory trustees.
They'll want to see you right away.
- You smoke?
- Thanks, I'll try one.
Have a South African one.
You part of this deal, doctor?
This stargazing?
No, I confine my gazing to the eye, ear, nose and throat.
I'm an MD.
I gather you're not an astronomer either.
I'm just a high-priced messenger boy who's beginning to doubt the sanity of astronomers.
They should stick to wrong weather predictions.
Astronomy is a very exact science.
But when they say Doomsday is around the corner, we part company.
Who's been telling you that?
Mr Randall, come right this way.
Hello, Tony, come along if you want to.
- Please...
- One second.
I have people waiting.
- I'm supposed to make sure.
- Yes, of course.
They check.
Who told you that, about Doomsday?
Why doc, I thought you were practically family.
Put it on the desk, Randall, please.
Thank you, dear.
Dr Bronson said I would get $1,500...
- I'll take care of it.
- But this is supposed to be COD.
Hold still, please.
Oh, thank you.
Would you mind waiting in the anteroom?
He knows all the details, Dad.
Dr Bronson and I have no secrets.
Has Bronson been at this study long?
Two years. But I first heard from him ten days ago...
He wanted me to check his findings.
Give this data to DA.
D for differential. A for analyser.
Differential analyser - DA.
Naturally.
We'll check these through the viewer.
- Dr Hendron, the key.
- Later, Randall, later...
Sometimes I wish I didn't know
Bronson's capabilities so well.
He rarely leaves any margin for error.
This was Bronson's first discovery.
Bellus, a star, a dozen times larger than earth, has been approaching earth at tremendous speed.
Bronson's second discovery - a new planet.
Bronson named it Zyra and his measurements show it revolves around Bellus more rapidly than earth revolves around the sun.
This is in the constellation of Scorpio.
Dr Frye, notice the position of these new bodies.
Yes, I see.
But here again, Bellus and Zyra have changed position.
Just how fast they've been moving and their eventual destination are among the mathematical problems being determined by our differential analyser.
We'll have the results in a few hours.
Zyra is about the same size as our earth.
Both these bodies are coming into our solar system.
If Bronson's readings are correct, they will destroy the earth.
How far away are they?
The calculator will be precise.
I estimate 3 billion miles.
Billion? Let people start worrying in a hundred years.
You've flown ships faster than sound.
These bodies are thousands of times faster and could be here within one year.
All this depends on Bronson being correct.
The planet Zyra will pass close enough to influence the tides.
Oceans will be torn from their depths.
Tidal waves will sweep in from the coasts.
There will be giant earthquakes.
Handfuls of people may survive if provisions are made.
We'll make them.
Every possible effort.
Whatever help my factories can give, we'll give gladly.
It will be useless. Soon after,
Bellus will collide with the earth.
Our world will end.
There is no error.
I always wanted to do this.
Want to try?
It's funny. I keep thinking about a Mr Simmons.
He was a patient of mine when I was interning.
One of those incurable cases.
I used to wonder how he felt the day he asked me how much longer he had to live.
Now I think I know.
- Joyce?
- Yes?
Let's not put off getting married.
There isn't any reason to wait, is there?
I promised Dad I'd wait.
There'll be so much to do.
Your father will be the first to agree.
The time that's left should be ours.
We're entitled to be selfish when we know what's coming.
I'd feel better if I talked to Dad first.
He'll be home the day after tomorrow.
- Dr Drake?
- Yes?
There is a call for you from the hospital.
Thank you.
Excuse me, I'll be right back.
I never used to believe my mother's stories about Americans being the most progressive people.
I thought she was boasting because she was born here.
But this is proof of progress.
They charge for drinks...by the inch.
Look, stargazer, arithmetic is your department.
How much is seven times $2.50?
Real progress, $17.50 per bottle.
- Tell me something, stargazer.
- What is it?
You and the doctor going to get married?
I don't know.
Maybe you could tell me where I could find out.
Why?
I'd like to stop being an interested bystander.
Bronson gets in tomorrow.
I'll tell him he was right to say the day was coming when money wouldn't mean a thing to me.
May I trouble you for another light?
Thank you, Madam.
This is the day. Money to burn!
I must ask one question that all the delegates want answered.
I hope I have your confidence.
You are satisfied there is no error and that all the facts are correct?
Yes, sir.
The effect of Zyra's passing should be felt about one o'clock on the afternoon of July 24th.
What about the giant star, Bellus?
Can the doctor tell us when this second body will threaten?
19 days later.
Bellus will crush the earth on the morning of August 12th.
This is not a publicity seeking campaign.
We are aware that most of our colleagues ridicule our findings.
But believing what we do, we have to ask for this hearing.
Therefore, I ask you, Dr Hendron, if it is with complete certainty that you say the world will end next August 12th?
Precisely that, sir.
There is a very remote possibility, that a few people may be saved.
The world will be destroyed, but a few people will be saved?
Our world will end on August 12th, in eight months.
There is no margin for error in that.
But we believe that Zyra once contained living matter.
We believe, and this is theory not certainty, that some form of vegetation may exist on Zyra.
You are proposing that we all pack our trunks and move to...Zyra?
No, but we hope that with God's guidance, a few may do exactly that.
A 20th century Noah's ark.
As many as can be built in this short time.
Eventually, as Zyra and Bellus speed toward us, even a layman will see the danger.
As a train looms in the distance, in an instant it is upon you.
With enough funds, labour and material,
Dr Frye believes rockets can be built to fly to Zyra.
But eight months is very little time.
Only if work begins immediately can this be done.
If you wait until the danger is visible, it will be too late.
Bellus and Zyra will be upon us and crush the earth!
Dr Ottinger, of the Estabrook Observatory.
Gentlemen, my colleagues,
Dr Felix Zenta,
Professor of astronomy at Cornwall
University and Dr Jonathan Wilson,
President of the International
Planetary Research Institute, and I have examined the photographs and data submitted by Drs Hendron and Bronson.
Our findings show there is no cause for alarm.
No reason to spend billions of dollars to build spaceships which never will be needed.
Suppose they were built.
Do either of you believe spaceships can fly to any planet?
It is theoretically possible.
I believe in theories. But when you say flying to another planet is possible you are out of the realm of theory and dreaming of the impossible.
Even if the world were to end, would it be less unpleasant to die in space than here, on firm ground?
The world will not end.
Certainly, these new bodies will pass our planet.
Heavenly bodies frequently do.
But we are still here.
Predicting the end of the world is an annual crackpot event in our society.
An attempt to corner the newspaper headlines.
But I did not expect a man of Dr Hendron's background to join this headline-hunting parade.
Read all about it!
End of the world just around the corner.
Read all about it!
Let's be thankful for small favours.
The subcommittee didn't believe us.
At least they didn't ridicule us.
No one believes us.
How will we interest enough private capital?
I'll buy you a start on your ship!
I'll settle for the satisfaction that I contributed to salvaging something from our old world.
I'm older and richer than you are.
I'll arrange the lease on a large camp - an old government site.
Between us, you'll have enough to start.
Wonderful, Spiro!
I'll arrange the details for our next meeting.
Gentlemen.
- Have you got a minute, Dad?
- I'm marking time.
We have an appointment with Sydney Stanton.
Will he give you the money you need?
I hope so.
He made the appointment.
Tony's outside.
- I'm sure he didn't come to see me.
- He wants to marry me, now.
I don't blame him.
Isn't marriage what you want?
I've liked Tony more than any other man.
I was always sure we would get married one of these days.
There isn't time for uncertainty.
You have to answer this question.
Do you want to spend what time is left as Tony's wife?
I wish I could answer.
I suppose it really doesn't matter... and it is what Tony wants.
- Not what you want?
- I don't know that either.
Dad, I'm so mixed up.
I can't think straight.
Do I know this subject of your confusion?
Dave Randall.
I don't know why, when or where.
I told myself I like being with him only because he's someone different.
- Yes?
- Mr Stanton is here.
Tell Dr Frye and send in Mr Stanton.
You told me to answer the question.
Let Tony wait a while longer.
And give me two minutes after Stanton leaves to figure out an excuse to keep Dave Randall right here.
Oh, thanks, Dad! Thanks!
- Dr Hendron.
- Mr Stanton.
- This is Dr Frye.
- Doctor of what?
Dr Frye is the dean of the Eastern School of Technology.
All right, I'm here safe and sound.
Go outside and read the magazines!
Will this Noah's ark get to that new planet?
In theory. On some engineers' calculations it is possible.
Your observatory trustees,
Marston and Spiro, tell me you have an equipped camp but need money to finish the ship.
- Millions!
- Amounts don't stagger me.
I'm just weighing the percentages.
Your word against other astronomers.
Wilson, Ottinger, Zenta.
- They think you're a crackpot.
- I know.
- It will mean liquidating some interests.
- It may save a civilisation!
Their salvation doesn't interest me.
Mine does!
I'm no humanitarian like Marston and Spiro. I just don't relish dying.
What are the chances of existence on this new planet?
We don't know.
We can only hope they're good.
- Millions for theories!
- The end of the world is no theory to us.
If I thought it was, I wouldn't be here.
All right. I'll pay for your ark.
- But I select who goes with us.
- This won't be a commercial liner.
There may be space for 40 human beings, some machinery and livestock.
The minimum for a new life.
You're not qualified to select those people.
I reserve that privilege.
Make up your mind.
You admit you don't relish dying.
You're willing to put up the money as life insurance, that if the world ends, you'll be among the few to reach this new world.
That makes my proposition simple.
Your money for your life.
We'll do the picking together.
Half and half.
Why not? Why should you be the one to give life or take it away?
The proposition still stands.
Your money or your life.
You know I can't refuse. Build it.
You are the men selected.
Gentlemen, this is a rough design of our ship.
Instead of taking off in a customary manner, straight up, we will conserve fuel by using a mile-long slide to give us impetus.
The ship will be cradled on a rocket-propelled undercarriage which will be automatically released.
At this point, the wing engines will be turned on.
The power of all engines will be used to carry us out of earth's gravitational pull.
We will then be in free ascent, until we reach the gravitational pull of Zyra, when the ship will be operated as a normal aircraft.
Similar rocket ships are also being constructed in other countries.
Now about our camp and its working conditions.
Dave Randall, who is assisting
Dr Hendron, will talk to you about that.
Thanks, Dr Frye.
First, you were selected because you are the top engineering students here.
Agricultural students and mechanics, all were picked in this way.
The project needs you because you are fine technicians who are healthy and free to make your own decision.
There is no guarantee that the ship will reach Zyra.
But those to make the flight will be chosen by lots, sometime before the worlds collide.
Only about 40 persons can be taken and already more than 600 people are working on this project.
Go down to the bunker first.
Joyce Hendron, please.
Take your new arrivals to dormitory C.
- Got the cards for this group?
- Yes, sir.
- Are my cards ready?
- Right here, Miss Hendron.
All right, fellas, this way.
Thanks. I'll leave these at the clinic.
Follow me, girls.
Dr Frye, please, Dr Frye.
There is a call for you from the microfilm laboratory.
Julie!
See you later.
Check in at the medical clinic within 30 minutes.
Attention, new arrivals.
Check in at the medical clinic within 30 minutes.
Dr Bronson, please, go to the chart room.
Attention, main garage.
Two jeeps are needed immediately at the foot of the ramp approach.
Animals now waiting for unloading on east end siding.
- Hello, Tony.
- Joyce!
- Did you have a nice trip?
- 17 new people. Where's Dad?
Dr Ottinger asked me to come to New York for a conference with Wilson and Zenta.
I'll put these new cards in the file.
- Is this the new design?
- That's right.
The drawings came while you were away.
Bronson tells me Ottinger and the other doubting Thomases have jumped over to our side of the fence.
That will end the newspapers calling me a lunatic.
Stanton's folly!
With time running out, they'll wish they had a fleet of Stanton's follies.
They admit our calculations are correct but insist our flight is impossible.
Even in other countries where ships are being built, most say it isn't possible.
- And you?
- I believe as I did before. In theory...
Always theories.
Jigsaw puzzles on paper.
- Aren't you ever positive?
- Only about Doomsday.
A government representative will warn people tomorrow.
They will be evacuated to mountain locations.
What provisions have you made to protect us when the panic starts?
- I haven't thought about it.
- I have.
I don't deal in theories.
I deal in realities.
Ferris! Bring in those boxes.
I brought enough rifles to stop a small army.
- There'll be no panic.
- Stop theorising.
Once the havoc is over, every mother's son will try to climb aboard our ship.
People know only a handful can make the flight.
You've spent too much time with the stars.
You don't know about the law of the human jungle. I've spent my life at it.
You don't know what your civilised people will do to cling to life.
I do, because I'd cling if I had to kill to do it. And so will you.
We're the lucky ones with a chance to reach another world.
And we'll use those guns to keep your only chance to stay alive.
Ferris! Ferris!
There's no question that crisis impends.
The secretary is on his way.
We will have his message in a moment.
My friends, it is imperative that you listen closely.
This is a matter of life or death.
Your lives and those of everyone on earth.
At one o'clock on July 24th,
Zyra, a new planet, will pass so close to the Earth, it will cause mass destruction.
There is no doubt about the coming of Zyra.
Remember, there is no doubt.
By one o'clock on that day, whole populations must have been evacuated from coastal areas.
Plans have been made and all that can be done will be done.
When I was a kid, I read a book about the world ending.
I was so scared, I didn't dare sleep.
Then in the morning, the sun came out, everything looked so wonderful,
I forgot the story.
Life was beautiful all over again.
The same sun will be shining on the new world.
Look, stargazer,
I don't figure in this new world.
The past couple of months, you and I have been telling recruits the few to make the trip will be needed in the new world.
Scientists like you or your father,
Tony, farmers and mechanics.
You'll have things to offer.
But you won't be needing aerial taxi drivers for another hundred years.
Dad promised me that...
Dad said we'd need you.
Thanks, but Noah would have turned down my application fast.
I'm not applying for this trip.
Use a little arithmetic.
The ship's cargo is limited.
Every pound will count.
I weigh as much as a couple of lambs, three dozen chickens, one healthy farmer.
We're coming in.
Better see that they're strapped down.
Randall, calling Plateau Tower.
Come in, please, over.
Schedules of train, bus and plane departures will be made available in all countries.
Attention, please.
The commanding general will speak to you. Stand by.
This is an official order.
The evacuation will now proceed in an orderly manner.
There will be planes enough for all.
Women and children will go first.
Families will not be separated for long.
I repeat this.
Families will only be separated for the duration of the evacuation flight.
Women and children will now proceed to the designated planes.
Never before in the history of the world has humanity felt so close to God.
As Zyra inexorably rushes toward us perhaps to destroy the earth, men and women of all races and creeds pause to think, to pray and to atone.
As evacuation of coastal cities progressed, tales of acts of heroism and sacrifice poured into newspaper offices.
With few exceptions, transportation and utility workers volunteered to remain at their posts until the evacuation is completed.
Overnight, populations of inland cities were more than doubled.
Deserted, the once great city of New York is a ghost town.
Ten million mighty roaring machines suddenly shut off, waiting for the approach of Zyra.
The silence, an eerie foretelling of the destruction to come at one o'clock, the hour of doom!
According to your figures, by now we were supposed to feel the effects of Zyra's passing.
Tidal waves, oceans torn from their beds...
Millions of dollars for a false alarm.
Ottinger called you a crackpot.
All you scientists are crackpots.
Nothing is going to happen.
Ferris!
- Are you all right?
- Yes, Dad. I'm over here.
Attention! The ship is breaking loose. Emergency crews to ramp!
Move those l-beams to the ship!
Come on!
Go to the crane and use the hook to stop the undercarriage.
Lower the block!
Look out! The crane is falling.
Bronson!
This is Emergency Camp 9 again.
Is anyone left?
Can anyone hear us?
We are located 11 miles due north of Middletown.
That's about 100 miles from here.
There is desperate need here for drinking water...
Anything else for the helicopter, doctor?
Those boxes. I'll bring the rest.
Repeating - we are remaining on the air.
Can anyone hear us?
We need drinking water and medical supplies - plasma and penicillin.
You needn't come, Randall.
I can fly a helicopter.
- I've done a lot of parcel dropping.
- I can handle it.
Sounds like somebody rubbed you the wrong way.
That's an excellent diagnosis.
Would you like to prescribe a cure?
You're the doctor, you name it.
Now or later?
We need drinking water and medical supplies desperately - plasma and penicillin.
Later. Come on.
Can anyone help?
Can anyone hear us?
What's that?
For a minute, I thought maybe now was that later you mentioned.
I gave it a passing thought.
We cannot postpone the inevitable.
This meeting is to choose those to make the attempt to reach Zyra.
As you know, human cargo must be restricted to 7,000 lbs, 44 persons.
Every pound consumes fuel, which we cannot waste if we are to have any chance.
About 900 lbs already have been spoken for -
Mr Stanton, Dr Frye, my daughter, myself, Dr Drake and Mr Randall.
Unless there is some objection we intend to include another 40 lbs, our latest addition to the camp.
To again emphasise our fuel problem, most of it will be consumed in overcoming earth's gravitational pull.
Once this has been accomplished, engines will be turned off until we come into the gravitational pull of the new world.
In turning the ship completely around every ounce of fuel will be needed to avoid crashing.
Dr Frye and I hope we have worked out a sound plan.
It would be unwise for a man to know he is not to go while a man working at his side is among the fortunate few.
In this envelope is a list of numbers of those who will go.
In these boxes we have placed numbered discs.
The one on the left for the women, the other for the men.
Each of you will select and keep one disc.
This list will be posted on the dormitory bulletin boards shortly before the take off.
Is this plan satisfactory?
If there are no objections, please start the drawing.
This is the men's box.
Your box is here.
You pick both numbers.
This is the women's box.
You're already listed.
Hello, Dave.
I've been looking for you.
Not to quarrel about your sense of ethics - just to ask why?
I haven't any more right than any other man in this camp.
I'll grant you that.
I'll even admit my motive was selfish.
I want to do things according to Hoyle.
But Joyce is pretty important to me.
- And to me.
- I'm glad.
I'd do anything to ensure her chances.
Wouldn't you?
It isn't a free ride for Joyce.
She's qualified to go.
No more than some others.
We're stretching the point because she's important to both of us.
Why not for her sake, stretch the point further to include you?
Look, doctor. I've wrestled with this thing for weeks.
I can give you a dozen reasons why I shouldn't go.
Give me one good reason to include me.
She wants you, Dave.
That'll change. Tony will be there.
She's used to having him around.
They would have been married if I hadn't come into the picture.
Anyhow, why worry?
Maybe I drew a lucky number.
You didn't take any number from that box.
I had the exact number of discs in it.
One for every man and woman except the six people I named.
If you had taken a number, we would have been one short.
Look, doctor. The drawing is over.
You can't issue new numbers without starting a revolution among the lucky winners.
It's about time I donated something to this setup.
I won't be needed. I never have been.
I didn't give up much by not drawing.
What's one chance in 600?
Leaving me will save fuel.
Let it stay that way.
And I hope you won't say anything to Joyce.
Good night.
Attention, everyone!
Bellus growing larger.
Getting closer every hour.
And with every hour the time left gets shorter. So hurry!
More welders are needed by Construction Crew 3.
Please rush!
Seven days left.
We're falling behind schedule.
Trucks are waiting to load plasma and medical supplies. Hurry!
Less than six days left.
We're still behind schedule.
Construction Crew 5, report to the main bunker.
This engine's all right.
Let's try this one.
I'll take it.
It will work out all right, Joyce.
Please.
Only 79 hours to the collision with Bellus.
We're still more than three hours behind schedule. Hurry!
- Worried?
- No.
This ship is really well put together.
If anything can make it to the new world, this one will do it.
- Dave?
- Yeah?
How long would it take to learn this flight panel board?
A few weeks, maybe.
But Dr Frye knows every knob on the panel.
He can operate it in his sleep.
I hope so.
What'll happen when he blacks out?
Everyone will black out in the fast climb.
The direction will be set.
This will hold you on course.
- All the way to Zyra?
- No, but far enough.
The blackout won't last too long...a few minutes, tops.
This is no time to start doubting the ship, doc.
I'm not. I know how well it's been put together.
The trouble is I just learned how Dr Frye's put together.
His chance of coming out of the blackout isn't good.
- I've seen older men make it.
- At the speed we'll climb?
1,500 miles in a few minutes?
His heart won't stand that pressure.
When did you discover that?
Yesterday. When I made his cardiograph test.
I haven't told anyone yet - not even Frye.
Well, don't!
It won't help to scare everyone.
Like Doomsday, that can't be avoided.
We can't let Frye handle this flight.
Look, doc... maybe...well...
Dr Hendron and Frye must be told.
I can't take that responsibility.
That isn't what I wanted to say.
No...you're right.
You'll have to tell them, I guess.
There's no other choice.
If anything happens to Frye after we get out into space...
I don't suppose it makes any difference, crashing from 1,500 miles up, or dying on earth.
Either way, you're just plain dead.
After the blackout, one of the technology students,
Eddie Cummings could take over, if Frye tells him what to do.
If Frye is able to tell him after the blackout.
Dave, you're hedging!
We both know who can handle this flight.
Maybe not as good as Frye, but good enough.
Do you doubt being able to fly this ship?
I can fly her.
There isn't anyone else.
You're our life insurance.
If Frye doesn't make it, you can land the ship.
For months, I've tried to find a legitimate reason to go.
I never could. Maybe things were meant to happen this way.
Diagnose it any way you want.
All I know is, I'd feel a lot easier, not having to tell Frye the news.
Be right back!
This is the last of the chloroform.
Put it somewhere handy to the animal pens.
You going to give the animals a mickey finn?
If we don't, the pressure will drive them mad.
We wouldn't want to see them kick the ship apart.
I'll never forget what you did for Dave and me, Tony.
I told you the doctor would fix everything.
Come here, Whatsis.
- Come on.
- Where are you from, boy?
- He's mine.
- Where did you get him, Mike?
- Downtown.
- You mean down at the airfield?
He was walking around.
I hate to remind you, but you said the doctor can fix everything.
That's right, I did, didn't I?
Let's weigh him.
Incidentally, he's a she.
Nine lbs, two ounces.
Sure, Whatsis is gonna pinch it for a couple of plump chickens.
Urgent! We are still
32 minutes behind schedule.
Those making the attempt to reach Zyra, report without delay to Dr Drake.
- I knew it would be like this!
- What did you expect?
My number - it's on! I'm on the list!
Julie! I'm on the list!
Julie! My number!
I'm on the list!
Remember, if we delay the take off as long as possible,
Zyra's position will form a perfect orbit with ours.
I hope we can retain that extra fuel to keep us flying over Zyra, while we look for landing room.
Zyra will be about here in relation to earth.
If you hold the ship to this curve, we can meet her orbit and run parallel.
The fuel will last longer with less cargo!
Why risk taking so many people?
You and that chair weigh 186 lbs.
That's a lot of fuel.
Do you want to donate that weight?
No more than you want to donate your life!
Or your daughter's.
I paid for this ship. You would have been wiped out with the rest of the world!
Before you paid, you tried to make this a personal enterprise.
A private rocket ship for your own special use.
This project was started by real humanitarians. By Marston and Spiro.
They gave their money with no strings attached.
You're not here under any special licence.
You're always shouting for facts.
Remember these facts.
Our chance of reaching the new world is as thin as you becoming a humanitarian!
If we make it, will we be able to land?
Will the air be fit to breathe?
Will there be water? Vegetable life?
Men and women here have been praying for God's help.
Not your kind of hypocritical praying, but the kind that comes from deep inside a man.
- Sorry. I'll come back later.
- No. We can't put things off till later.
I just wanted to leave this for someone else to use.
He has a girl, Julie Cummings.
I guess he doesn't want to leave her.
There's that extra fuel.
He must weigh close to 180.
You heard him volunteer to stay behind.
Shut the door.
You're not taking it from him!
He turned it back of his own free will.
Get out. Ferris!
The other side of the door for you.
Shut up!
This is one of the good ones, isn't it?
I'm sorry.
The people have all been selected.
- I'm going too.
- Put that gun down.
I'd almost rather kill you than go along.
For seven years, ever since I started pushing this chair around,
I've hated your insides.
You're a very easy man to hate.
I'd like to reason things out.
You see...
No! You three are running things.
You'll tell everybody I'm going!
This is my number.
That's all the reasoning I want to know.
And if I don't go...
- He was going to kill us.
- Better give it to me.
I said this would happen.
And not just Ferris!
There'll be others. All of them.
They won't wait to die here.
- He may be right.
- There's a lot of bad feeling.
One boy was stabbed after the list was posted. There've been fist fights.
It's dog eat dog.
The law of the jungle.
We can't risk it.
What do we do now?.
Move the women on board and lock the gates.
The men can wait outside until take off!
- The guns are in my room.
- That's out!
We'll have to move people and animals as quietly as possible.
- There's a girl...
- Julie Cummings.
Tell her there's been a mix-up.
She and Eddie Garson are going.
We'll gamble on less flying time over the new world.
- Let me tell you...
- Don't say it Stanton!
Don't say anything.
The last dawn!
I think we can start boarding.
All right, everyone, inside the ship!
I'll bring Mr Stanton.
Why should our lives be decided by a raffle?
How do we know it wasn't fixed?
- It should have been by voting!
- Let's take the ship!
Gangway, boys.
- Here are the guns Stanton left.
- That's all we need!
- Let's go. Grab a gun.
- There's no sense in this.
- We agreed to the drawing.
- Listen to him.
Take the ship. Then what?
Only 40 can get away.
The rest of us will get rid of that 40, and the next 40 until we kill each other or get caught when the worlds collide!
Stick around until the collision puts you out of your misery.
Get me on board.
You were right. You're a better judge of people than I am.
Get me aboard. No, Hendron.
What are you doing? Stop him!
Hendron, what are you doing?
No. Wait. Help!
Dr Hendron.
Get on board, hurry.
Hold the gangplank.
Hold the ramp, wait!
We're the extra fuel they might need.
The new world isn't for us.
It's for the young.
Dave! The ship is moving. Stand by.
We're out of the pressure zone.
The engines are off.
We're on course.
You invented those cardiographs for my benefit.
Yours and Joyce's.
- How does it look?
- Better than we expected.
We'll need every bit, or we'll hit the new world head-on, at ten miles a second.
- We're getting close.
- In a minute we'll feel the pull.
Turn the ship.
Start all engines.
We're slowing.
- Can I cut one engine?
- Not yet. Keep them all going.
- We're using fuel too fast.
- We have no choice.
The ship has turned for landing.
Take over.
Cut wing engines one and six.
I'm going to level off.
Brace yourselves.
We're levelling the ship.
Land anywhere! We've got to.
- Not yet.
- Check your belts.
The fuel's gone.
There's an opening!
- There go the engines!
- I'll bring it around and glide in.
- It looks frozen!
- I hope so!
We're going to find out.
- We made it!
- We're here!
- We're on Zyra.
- Let's get out!
Dave, wait until we've tested the atmosphere.
We'll get a sample through the airlock.
Never mind. Good air or bad, it's the only place we can go!
Best air I ever tasted.
Break out the gangplank.
Mike! Where is he?
Hey, Mike!
Don't you want to see the sunrise?
- Our first citizens.
- And they're all mine!
- They sure are.
- Every one.
Well, let's leave Whatsis and the puppies here.
Now, let's go look at the first sunrise.
In WWI, for the first time ever,
nations combined to fight nations,
using the crude weapons of the day.
WWII involved every continent.
Science provided new tools of war.
These reached an unparalleled peak
in their capacity for destruction.
Now, fought with the
terrible weapons of super-science,
menacing every creature
on Earth, comes...
No one would have believed,
in the middle of the 20th century,
human affairs were being closely
watched by a greater intelligence.
Yet, across the gulf of space,
on the planet Mars,
intellects vast and unsympathetic
regarded our Earth enviously,
slowly and surely
drawing their plans against us.
Mars is more than 140 million miles
from the sun.
For centuries it has been
in the last stages of exhaustion.
At night, temperatures drop
far below zero, even at its equator.
The inhabitants of this dying planet
looked across space with instruments
of which
we have scarcely dreamed,
searching for another world
to which they could migrate.
They could not go to Pluto,
outermost of all planets,
and so cold that its atmosphere
lies frozen on its surface.
They couldn't use Neptune or Uranus,
twin worlds in eternal night,
both surrounded by an atmosphere
of methane gas and ammonia vapor.
They considered Saturn, attractive
with its moons and rings,
but its temperature is
close to 270 degrees below zero,
and ice lies 15,000 miles deep
on its surface.
Their nearest world was Jupiter,
with giant cliffs of lava and ice,
with hydrogen flaming at the tops.
The atmosphere is awful. Thousands
of pounds to the square inch.
They couldn't go there, nor to Mercury,
nearest planet to the sun.
It has no air. The temperature at
its equator is that of molten lead.
Of all the worlds the life forms
on Mars could see and study,
only our own Earth was green
with vegetation, bright with water,
and possessed a cloudy atmosphere
eloquent of fertility.
It did not occur to mankind that a
swift fate might be hanging over us.
Or that from the blackness of outer
space we were being scrutinized.
Till the time we drew close to Mars'
orbit, during a pleasant summer...
- Is that a fireball or something?
- Boy, that's big.
- I wonder where it hit?
- Probably halfway to Pomona.
I'm gonna see. Who's coming?
This is Pine Summit. I got a smoke.
- Azimuth: 160 degrees, 30 minutes.
Big? I bet it's as big as anything that ever lit in California.
Better get something over there.
It's started a blaze already.
Number Three to D.O.
- D.O. to Number Three, come in.
- We're getting this under control.
Okay, send the tanker in, but you
stand by until that thing cools off.
- Someone ought to check on it.
- There's scientists fishing nearby.
They probably saw it come down.
I'll tell them. What's it look like?
It's too hot to get near enough for a good look, but it's enormous.
I got a message for you. You're the guys from Pacific Tech, ain't you?
- Looks like the fishing was good.
- Have some?
Well, I might just do that.
It's about that meteor.
They say it's a whopper.
They phoned us up on the summit.
I thought you might be interested.
- About 10 miles from here.
- It didn't come down like a meteor.
That's right.
It came down in spurts.
You fellows figure it out.
You're scientists.
It's big as a house and red-hot.
- I'll borrow your car and take a look.
- We ought to get back.
- I'll fly Bilder back down in your plane.
- Okay, the insurance is paid up.
- Light?
- No, I'll smoke it later.
Did you watch it come down?
I saw it from my window.
Harold, look here a minute.
Step over a little. Smile.
It must have skidded along the gully.
Then the loose earth shook down over it.
- I guess most of it's buried.
- That's 12 feet thick.
They run heavy. They won't be able to haul this one away to no museum.
A good attraction for Sunday drivers.
Better than a lion farm or snake pit. We won't have to feed it.
- We can sell tamales and hot dogs.
- Ice cream, cold drinks, souvenirs.
- We should put up picnic tables.
- Then they'd bring their own lunch.
- Gonna dig for gold, Buck?
- You think you're kidding?
It'll be like having a gold mine in your own back yard.
I'm gonna get a closer look at it.
- That's it over there.
- It's still pretty darned hot.
- Be careful, Buck.
- Watch it.
- Did you see it come down?
- Yes, I was fishing in the hills.
- That's a lot of tackle.
- The others flew back in my plane.
Why didn't it make a bigger crater?
It hit sideways and skidded in.
That's what I think.
A scientist's coming, he'll tell us.
- Ever hear of Clayton Forrester?
- What's that fellow trying to do?
He's top man in astro and nuclear physics. He knows all about meteors.
- You seem to know all about him.
- I did a thesis on modern scientists.
- Did it do you any good?
- Sure, I got my degree.
- Say, do you have a match?
- No, I'm sorry. I don't smoke.
They had Forrester on the cover of
Time. You have to rate to get that.
- He isn't that good.
- You don't even know him!
- I do know him, slightly.
- What's he like?
Well, he's like...
You don't look like yourself in that get-up, but I'm happy to meet you.
Sylvia Van Buren.
I teach library science at USC.
- I didn't know how to stop you.
- You didn't wear glasses in Time.
They're for long distance. To look at something close, I take them off.
- You could fry eggs on that thing.
- The sand is keeping the heat in.
Uncle, Dr. Forrester. Dr. Matthew
Collins is the pastor here.
- Well, how do you do?
- How do you do, sir?
Hey, you!
What have you got in here?
It's ticking like a bomb.
This is a Geiger counter for detecting radioactivity.
- It's that meteor.
- It's radioactive?
Yes. It's difficult to account for a reaction like that.
- Look at it. It's going crazy!
- Maybe we should keep people away.
I'll post a few deputies.
That meteor is either very light, which is unheard of, or it's hollow.
If it were heavy and solid, it would have made a tremendous crater.
I'll wait around until it cools off.
Is there a place I could clean up?
- I'd like you to stay at my house.
- Thank you.
It won't be cool for 24 hours. What do people do here on a Saturday?
- Not much of anything.
- There's a square dance tonight.
Allemande left and the ladies star.
Gents walk around, but not too far.
Allemande left and the gentlemen star.
Ladies walk around, but not too far.
First and third balance and swing.
Promenade the outside ring.
Three quarters round the outside ring.
Through that couple and not too far.
Meet in the center with right hand star.
Swing your corner with left hand round.
Let's take another look at it.
- It's almost cold now.
- We might as well go home.
- No sense staying out here.
- Let's go.
Hey, it's moving!
- It's a bomb!
- It didn't go off last night...
- Maybe it's gonna go off now.
- It's a sneak attack. Let's go.
Wait a minute.
Bombs don't unscrew.
It's no meteor. That's for sure.
Darnedest thing I ever saw, the way that's unscrewing.
- Thank you, Doctor. Having fun?
- You know what I was thinking?
The energy from one square dance could send the meteor back home.
- Must be somebody in there.
- Who? Where do they come from?
I read that Mars is near Earth now.
It happens every 20 years, they say.
Men from Mars...
- What do you think?
- Maybe these are not men, like us.
Everything human doesn't have to look like you and me.
If it's men from Mars, we ought to let them know we're friendly.
- No, you don't know what it is.
- We'd be the first to make contact.
We'd be in all the papers.
We could walk out there with a white flag.
I got an old sugar sack in my car.
What are we going to say to them?
"Welcome to California."
Come on.
We're friends!
Open up!
- How will they understand us?
- We'll talk in sign language.
Everybody understands that the white flag means we want to be friends.
- Hey there, open up!
- Come on out, we're friends!
- We welcome you!
- We're friends!
No smooching in the dark, folks.
- Any candles around?
- All the lights in town are out.
- Somebody found some candles.
- I like it in the dark.
Call the electric company and see what happened.
- Hey, the phone's gone dead.
- The phone isn't on the same circuit.
What are they saying? Something's wrong with my hearing aid.
We play "Good Night Ladies" at midnight, anyway. It's near that now.
- My watch has stopped.
- I've got the time.
- Mine's stopped, too.
- Mine ain't working. What is this?
They've all stopped at the same time.
There's only one explanation for a thing like this. Do you have a pin?
See that? My watch is magnetized.
That's what knocked the phones out, too.
- But everyone's watches all together?
- Do you have a pocket compass?
- The needle isn't pointing north.
- It's pointing toward the meteor.
Let me through!
- What's going on?
- I don't know any more than you do.
Look at the fire out there!
The power lines are down.
That explains why the lights went out.
- Hey, look at the cars!
- Where are the three men you left?
Look there!
People in town started to follow us.
Don't let them come near here.
Get under cover!
- What is that gizmo?
- A machine from another planet.
We'd better get word to the authorities. Look!
Sheriff, you'd better get word to the military. You'll need them.
Get moving. On the double.
Take cover along the riverbed.
Get those 30s over here.
The area is controlled by Marines.
The gully is surrounded.
Here is Prof. McPherson of Canada.
Is it true you've had reports of landings in other places? Canada?
Not in Canada yet, but in
Bordeaux, France. Some in Spain...
There's supposed to be one down in Italy.
We're trying to locate the second meteor that landed here at midnight.
- Do you think they come from Mars?
- Dr. Forrester?
It's possible. It seems certain they're from some other planet.
If they are Martians, what would
they look like? Bigger? Smaller?
As to Martians, our heavier air
would oppress them.
You think they'd breathe like us.
What about hearts and blood?
If they are Martians, with hearts,
they'd beat at a slower rate.
Their senses could be
quite different from ours.
They may be able to smell colors.
It is possible that they would have
more than one brain.
- Two? Three? Just think of that!
- It's only speculation.
What about these meteor machines?
They're probably controlled by jets,
navigated with a gyroscope system.
Thank you, Doctor. Colonel, can you tell us anything about this plane?
It'll drop a flare. Then Air Force cameramen will get pictures.
There's been a lot of mysterious activity around the machine.
Lights and dust, as if they're digging themselves out. There it comes again!
If it keeps up, it'll be a guide for the plane.
The pilot's just blipped his motor.
That means he's dropped the flare.
We'll be the first men on Earth to get a real look at these invaders from space.
They're after the plane with their rays!
Jump for it!
Here we are...
Hey, they cut me off!
They got my truck!
They'll come out of the gully soon.
Our defenses have to be ready.
- You'll need plenty of reinforcements.
- We'll get them.
- The troops are certainly moving in.
- You sent word to the 6th Army?
No, Col. Heffner's in charge.
You never know where you'll wind up when you go to a square dance.
- That's D-24.
- Correct.
Locate your observation post on this hill.
Position your recoilless 75s back here. Carbon Canyon.
I want your battery here. In daylight you may be exposed. Be ready to pull out.
- But you'll get first crack at them.
- Suits me, sir.
Heffner...
Half-tracks? Okay.
Get in back of Hill Three.
If it's a moving target, follow up from there. Over and out.
They've located that second meteor.
There's one, there's the other.
We're right between them.
- So is the town.
- I warned them to prepare to evacuate.
Everyone has been alerted.
- Gen. Mann, I was told to expect you.
- I'm here to report back, not interfere.
Clayton Forrester,
I haven't seen you since Oak Ridge.
This is Pastor Collins,
Sheriff Bogany, head of local control.
- Miss Van Buren.
- Would you care for some coffee?
Gen. Mann's in charge of intelligence for the Pacific area.
You've certainly got them surrounded.
- They've neutralized communications?
- Not all. The field phones are okay.
A cylinder reported by Huntington
Beach. That's a job for the Navy.
- Any news from abroad?
- We're in touch with their militaries.
They're coming down all over.
Santiago has two cylinders.
They're outside London.
They're in Naples.
We've got them between here and Fresno. Two on Long Island.
- They're coming down at random.
- No.
According to information from foreign sources, they have some kind of plan.
What it is isn't clear yet, because once they begin to move, no more news comes out of that area.
We've had reports of destruction, massacre.
"Town south of Bordeaux wiped out by ray."
"Local reports say nothing remains."
What do you make of that?
- All we've seen is their heat ray.
- Our newest weapons will stop them.
From the data, and that picture the Air Force took tonight, this is the original pilot ship.
Its observations guided the others down.
One lands, then two, making groups of three joined magnetically.
My orders are not to go into action unless they move out of the gully.
This is the only place we have them contained.
What happens here will be a guide to other operations.
When it starts, and a defense pattern develops, I'll report to Washington.
- You've deployed your forces well.
- We'll blast them right off Earth.
They'll probably move at dawn.
There's something moving in the gully.
Look at it.
Beings from another world.
- Is it a flying machine?
- No.
It's supported from the ground by rays.
Probably some form of magnetic flux.
This is amazing!
They must keep the opposing poles in balance and lift the machine.
Stand by to fire.
All command posts, stand by to fire.
- But Colonel, shooting's no good.
- It's always been a good persuader.
Shouldn't you try communicating with them first, then shoot, if you have to?
Target as indicated.
We should try to make them understand we mean them no harm.
There's another machine coming out!
They are living creatures.
They're not human.
They're an advanced civilization.
If they're more advanced than us, they should be nearer the Creator.
No real attempt has been made to communicate with them.
Let's go back inside, Uncle Matthew.
I've done all I can in there.
You go back. Sylvia...
I like that Dr. Forrester.
He's a good man.
Attention all batteries:
Prepare for volley fire.
Who's that?
What is he doing?
- Uncle! Stop him!
- It's too late. He's too far away.
Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil.
It's seen him.
Thou anointest my head with oil.
My cup runneth over.
And I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever...
- Let 'em have it!
- Fire!
The shells can't get through. They've put up an electromagnetic covering.
That skeleton beam must be what they used to wipe out the French city.
Cut across their lines of magnetic force and any object will cease to exist.
Take my word for it, General.
This defense is useless against them.
You'd better let Washington know. Fast.
Hold them as long as you can.
Order all command posts to pull back north of the tunnel bunker.
Everybody out of here! The Air Force will take care of these babies now.
Dr. Forrester, get out of here.
Everybody out...
- Can't you go higher?
- The air will be full of jets in a minute.
Read all about the Martian invasion.
They're in New York and Miami.
Fighting outside Los Angeles.
Read all about it.
- Hold it right there, General.
- What do you think of the situation?
- Do you believe we can hold them?
- Sorry, I've no time.
Break it up.
The way he's hedging, maybe we didn't hold them. I've heard news.
Australia, India...
Nobody's stopped them yet.
- If the city must be evacuated...
- Many have already moved out.
- We've mobilized cars and buses.
- The Red Cross is standing by.
The enemy is 30 miles outside Los Angeles.
Not in full force yet, but developing.
It can happen any minute.
- Washington is on the line, sir.
- General Mann.
I'd say our effective losses were 60% men, 90% material.
The jets went in but none came out.
Bombers were knocked out of the sky, and their bombs did nothing.
Their electronic umbrella is quite impenetrable.
Forrester thinks they generate atomic force without the screening we use.
Very well, sir.
Get me the fastest plane we've got.
Now I'll make a statement to those reporters.
All right, the general will see you now.
We heard Forrester was out with you.
What does he think about this?
- Ask him. He's back at Pacific Tech.
- No, he's not. He hasn't shown up.
Wake up.
Let's get moving.
- Are you all right?
- It's that machine!
It's gone.
We're south-west of Corona.
There must have been another cylinder down here. They cleared everyone out.
There's a farmhouse out there.
Let's find something to eat.
We're doing all right.
I almost forgot when I ate last.
That looks good. Mostly I get my meals in coffee shops and restaurants.
- Don't you live at home?
- No, on campus. I haven't any family.
I come from a big one. There's nine of us, all in Minnesota. Except me.
I have no close folks.
My parents died when I was a kid.
A big family must be fun. It must make you feel you belong to something.
It does. Maybe that's why
I feel lost right now.
We'll get out safely. Don't worry.
They murder everything that moves.
If they're mortal, they have mortal weaknesses. They'll be stopped.
I haven't been close enough to them for any real observation.
I feel like I did once when I was small.
Awful scared and lonesome.
I'd wandered off. I've forgotten why.
The family and whole crowds of neighbors were hunting for me.
They found me in a church.
I was afraid to go in anyplace else.
I stayed by that door, praying for the one who loved me best to find me.
- It was Uncle Matthew who found me.
- I liked him.
He liked you.
Oh, I could bawl my head off.
But you won't, you're not the kind.
You're tired. You've been up all night.
You crashed in a plane, slept in a ditch.
You want to know something?
It doesn't show on you at all.
Get down!
- How long was I out?
- Hours. I've been so scared!
They're right outside.
Several of them came down together.
There's a machine standing right alongside of us.
An electronic eye.
Like a television camera.
It's looking for us.
Maybe they're not too sure we're here.
They could be as curious about us as we are about them.
Maybe they want to take us alive.
It's pulling out.
Can't we get out of here?
- Something moved out there.
- There's nothing there now.
- It was one of them!
- What was it like?
- I couldn't see much in the dark.
- I've got to get a good look at them.
- They've blocked it!
- It's blocked here, too.
They've pushed earth all around the outside.
Here, this is the way up to the attic.
Look out!
Your scarf.
It's wet.
Blood...
Stop it. Stop it!
We've got to make a run for it.
Come on!
The Martians had calculated their
descent with amazing perfection.
As more of their cylinders came from
the mysterious depths of space,
their war machines, awesome
in their power and complexity,
created a wave of fear
throughout the world.
Governments tried to coordinate their
defenses with those of other nations.
The government of India
met in a railroad coach,
while millions streamed for the
imagined safety of the Himalayas.
The Finnish, Turkish, Chinese and
Bolivians worked and fought furiously.
Every effort against their other-world
antagonists ended in the same rout.
As the Martians burned fields and
forests, and cities fell before them,
people were driven from their homes.
The stream of flight became a torrent.
It became a giant stampede,
without order or goal.
It was the beginning of the rout of
civilization, the massacre of humanity.
A great silence fell over half of Europe,
as all communication was disrupted.
When the last wire photo out of Paris
reached the exiled French Cabinet,
they hit upon the idea
of usingjets as couriers.
Carrying extra fuel
instead of weapons,
they maintained contact with North
Africa, the US and especially England.
The Martians plainly knew the strategic
significance of the British Isles.
The people of Britain met the invaders
magnificently, but it was unavailing.
As the Martians swept toward London,
the British Cabinet stayed in session,
coordinating every item of
information that could be gathered,
passing it on to the UN in New York,
and from there to Washington,
the only remaining
unassailed strategic point.
It's vital to prevent the Martian machines from linking up.
Once they do, they adopt an extraordinary military tactic.
They form a crescent, anchor it at one end and sweep on until they've cleared a quadrant.
Then they anchor the opposite end and reverse direction.
They slash across country, wiping out everything that's trying to evade them.
That's why communications are cut once they begin moving.
- Montreal's blacked out. Nothing.
- Same thing as on the Pacific coast.
- Anything from them yet?
- Still nothing from San Francisco.
- Here's that Los Angeles picture, sir.
- This is a sonic radar picture.
It shows details of the Martian nest outside Los Angeles.
Their machines appear as round blobs.
Newly fallen cylinders are elongated.
There are three cylinders to each group, three machines to each cylinder.
All right, I've seen enough.
Only one thing will stop them. We've held back because of the radiation.
Now there's no choice. Washington will confirm an order to use the atom bomb.
Our first target will be the initial landing place outside L.A.
Have Pacific Tech monitor the drop.
I'll have the area cleared all around.
We can still hit them before dark.
We'll blast them all over the world.
- We've been looking all over for you.
- We walked half-way from Corona.
This is Miss Van Buren. Dr. Grotzman,
Dr. Pryor, James, Bilderbeck.
- What's this about the A-bomb?
- We're going in right after it.
- What's that?
- An electronic eye.
They modeled it after their own eye.
They use it the way we use a periscope.
- It'll tell us about their metals.
- We can find out about their optics.
- Very interesting.
- And this... the blood of a Martian.
I don't remember ever seeing blood crystals as anemic as these.
They may be mental giants, but by our standards, physically, they must be very primitive.
Everything about them seems to be in threes.
Their eyes have three lenses, three pupils. Strong light shocks them.
Sunlight on Mars is approximately half as strong as we get it.
Add their clouds and dust, it amounts to no more than our twilight.
Now, if you'll step over here, please.
We've rigged the epidiascope to reflect whatever the Martian lens picks up.
Move in a little. Thank you.
There's how the Martians see us.
Evidently there's a shift in their spectrum.
Their color absorption must be different from ours.
Let's see why they were so curious about you, Miss Van Buren.
- Time we got started, gentlemen.
- Let's go.
- Let's make an analysis of their blood.
- It might give us something.
You can get all the Martian blood you want after the plane drops the bomb.
The Flying Wing is going to carry it.
Tower, this is Flying Wing, ready for take-off.
Flying Wing, this is the tower.
Clear for take-off.
Wish us luck.
The target is the nest of
Martian machines in the Puente Hills, where more cylinders came down last evening.
A plane will pinpoint the target from six miles up.
This bomb is ten times more powerful than anything previously used.
It's the latest thing in nuclear fission.
Nothing like it has ever been exploded before. We're going to be pretty close, but there are observers in a forward bunker who will be a lot nearer than us.
The whole world is waiting.
This will decide the fate of civilization.
Whether we live or die may depend on what happens here.
Attention! Four minutes to bomb time.
There must be a couple of million people behind us in the hills, waiting to find out whether they can go home again.
All around the world, people have been driven from their homes.
Direct cable communication is being maintained with Washington, but there's no radio at all. Not even with the bomber that's coming over.
All radio is dead, which means that these recordings are for the sake of future history, if any.
Future history, he said.
Yes, if any.
Bilderbeck's calculated how long we have until they take over the world.
If the A-bomb fails, the Martians can conquer Earth in six days.
The same number of days it took to create it.
Attention! Two minutes to bomb time.
Prepare to take shelter.
If you have no goggles, turn away.
Remember, the heat flash and
concussion that follow are dangerous.
50 seconds.
There's the plane.
40 seconds.
We've sighted the plane, sir.
- 30 seconds.
- Look. Look!
They're using those protective blisters again.
Attention! Stand by.
15 seconds.
10 seconds. 9, 8, 7, 6...
Hello? What can you see?
There's something moving!
They haven't even been touched!
It didn't stop them. Guns, tanks, bombs, they're like toys against them!
It'll end only one way.
We're beaten.
No... Not yet.
Washington ordered all cities in danger of attack evacuated if the bomb fails.
They'll be moving on Los Angeles now.
We'll fight them back to the mountains.
Our best hope lies in what you people can develop to help us.
Six days, you said. Six days...
They'll stamp the city flat.
We'll establish a base laboratory in the Rocky Mountains.
- We'll search out their weaknesses.
- A forlorn hope.
- But there is a chance.
- We may get a lead from the blood.
- By some biological approach?
- We can't beat their machines.
We've got to beat them.
Everybody listen carefully!
The Martians are coming this way.
We must evacuate.
Take food, water and extra clothing.
All highways have been marked to
lead you to welfare centers in the hills.
Keep them rolling!
Come on!
- Gratzman, did you get those biotics?
- No, I thought you had them.
I'll get them. You get in the school bus.
Sylvia will drive you.
Let me up. I'll give you $500 for your place. I'll make it $1,000.
Money's no good anymore!
Here comes another truck!
Throw that guy off there!
Stop, you fools!
You fools!
- Quick, we've got to stop them!
- The law's no good here now.
- The thieves stayed behind.
- It's like this all over.
They must be stopped.
The instruments!
Hold it a minute!
We've got to have those instruments.
They're our only chance!
Did they grab the trucks ahead of me?
Did you see the Pacific Tech people?
I don't know. There's fighting all over.
- Did they get the school bus?
- If they saw it, they took it.
You can't buy a ride for love or money!
Gratzman! Bilderbeck!
Sylvia!
- Hey, you better get out of here!
- I'm looking for Pacific Tech people.
- There's nobody left around here now.
- We could have stopped them.
The mob stole the trucks and smashed everything. They cut their own throats!
He's nuts...
Come on, jump in.
Hurry up. Jump in!
There was a girl with them.
If I could find her...
- She's kind of lost.
- You look kind of lost yourself.
- But I think I know where she'll be.
- It's your last chance to get out of here.
We humbly beseech
Thy divine guidance, O Lord.
Deliver us from the fear which has come upon us.
From the evil that grows ever nearer.
From the terror that soon will knock upon the very door of this, Thy house.
O Lord, we pray Thee.
Grant us the miracle of Thy divine intervention.
Don't go, son. Stay with us.
No, I'm looking for someone.
She'll be in a church, near the door.
- Forrester!
- DuPrey, Bilderbeck! Are you?
- Where are the others?
- We don't know where they are.
I got knocked under our truck.
DuPrey pulled me out.
- What happened to Sylvia?
- We never did see her again.
In our peril we plead.
Succour and comfort us in this hour.
Please, God.
Sylvia!
Sylvia!
- Here! Here!
- Sylvia!
Let me through! Please!
It's quiet. Maybe they've gone away.
(SUDDEN LOUD
CRASHING SOUND)
Something's happening to them.
It's dead.
We were all praying for a miracle.
The Martians had no resistance
to the bacteria in our atmosphere.
Once they breathed our air, germs
harmless to us began to kill them.
The end came swiftly. All over the
world, their machines stopped and fell.
After all that men could do had failed,
the Martians were destroyed
and humanity saved
by the littlest things which God
in His wisdom had put upon this earth.

<font color="#E5E5E5">Ellen this spaceship must be destroyed</font>
<font color="#CCCCCC">home professor what did you see in there</font>
I saw the source of power<font color="#E5E5E5"> a mayor</font> globule<font color="#CCCCCC"> of energy but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mighty enough to</font> take the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ship here for Mars and back</font> again<font color="#E5E5E5"> the source of power</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's small</font>
<font color="#E5E5E5">incredibly small probably a</font>
- self-propagating atomic pile exactly in.
- The center<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the ship.</font>
Perhaps one determined blow delivered might release this power in the form of a terrific<font color="#CCCCCC"> explosion and blow delivered</font>
<font color="#E5E5E5">by the right person given the right</font> opportunity<font color="#E5E5E5"> but that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> will be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> suicide</font>

One more.
Just one more, please, Dr. Meacham.
Hold it, please.
A little closer to the wing, sir.
A little more profile, Dr. Meacham.
Yeah, he wants to get that faraway, visionary look.
Cal, we know how tired you must be.
We'll make it as short as possible.
Fire away, gentlemen.
But I warn you,
I am beginning to feel faraway and visionary.
How about your conference with the Committee on Atomic Power?
Oh, not my conference.
20 engineers and scientists were there.
Hardly a routine meeting, would you say?
Yeah, and look, Cal, we won't buy the committee's getting you VIPs together for a cocktail party.
All right, boys, I'll tell you this much.
Under discussion was the biggest job we've ever tackled, the industrial application of atomic energy.
But that's not news, Cal.
We all know there've been several industrial reactors in work already.
Well, let us say then that, in the light of recent developments, those plants may already be obsolescent.
Electronics is your specialty.
How does that fit in with atomic energy?
You boys like to call this a push-button age.
It isn't, not yet.
Not until we can team up atomic energy with electronics.
Then we'll have the horses as well as the cart.
How long has the Army been handing out jets, Doctor?
One of the boys at
Lockheed handed me this one.
I hope you taxpayers don't mind.
Cal, when do we get to this push-button age?
When fellows like me stop talking about it and get back to our labs.
I'll see you gentlemen later.
- Goodbye.
- So long.
Cal.
Cal, are you working on anything along the lines you mentioned?
Roughly.
Well, remember me, will you?
I'm concentrating on the re-conversion of certain common elements into nuclear energy sources.
Huh?
How's that again?
What counts is how I make it work.
I see.
Have a good flight, Cal.
Thank you.
So long.
2XD341, calling
Ryberg Control Tower, come in.
2XD341, this is Ryberg Control Tower.
Go ahead.
Okay to come in, Webb?
All clear, Cal.
The drift's south, about 20 miles per hour.
Hi, Webb.
What's Cal's ETA?
Half an hour late.
That's my boss.
The only guy in the world who can travel by jet and still be late.
So you talk about me when I'm gone.
Where are you?
Look out the window.
Cal, what's wrong?
I have no control.
Cut loose, Cal.
Bail out!
I can't.
I'm too low.
Jerking around must have caused a flame out.
No power.
No nothing.
Cal, you okay?
Okay.
What happened?
How'd you bring it in?
I didn't.
Couldn't.
What do you mean, you didn't?
Controls went out.
Huh?
That's right, no controls, no power.
The plane died up there.
I should be dead...
Cal, I know everybody's seeing flying saucers and screwy lights up in the sky.
Well, you can put me in the booby hatch, too, because, so help me,
I saw this ship turn a bright green up there.
Are you sure, Joe?
Positive.
Did you hear anything?
Yes.
A high-frequency howl.
Very high.
All the time your ship was...
Green?
Did Webb see it?
Unless he's blind.
Check him.
Right.
Oh, and, Joe, until we find out what happened, all three of us were blind.
How's the little giant?
Growing up.
Getting ready to astound the world.
Let's take a look.
I figured that.
She's all ready and waiting.
Lowering the cylinder.
Increase the rate of reaction.
Check rate of radioactive decay.
Positive.
The same it was the whole week you were away.
What did the committee say?
Oh, they were a little excited.
A little?
Zero reading.
The XC condenser must have shorted out again.
Get the spare.
Burned out yesterday.
And don't ask me why I didn't order some new ones.
I did.
XC condensers in an envelope?
Must be a gag dreamed up by the receiving department.
I ordered two XC condensers, and Supreme Equipment sent me these beads.
You say they're a gag, but they're condensers.
I checked one for capacity and voltage on the meter.
And blew it to bits.
Yeah.
After it held to 33,000 volts and no leakage.
If that were true, we could build a generator.
One that would supply electric power to run an entire factory.
It would fit in a matchbox.
It still read 33,000 volts.
I'll try one on voltage test.
I've got one set up for you.
Into thin air.
35,000 volts.
Call Pete Knowles at Supreme.
Okay.
Pete Knowles, please.
Pete?
Cal Meacham.
I ordered two XC condensers and you sent me some beads.
Yes, beads.
Well, I am serious.
I just tested one bead for voltage and...
Oh?
Well, thanks.
Supreme didn't send them.
They're crazy.
Pete says they've had no condenser order from us in six weeks.
Here's the duplicate of the order
I sent by teletype three days ago.
What's the address on the letterhead that came with the beads?
No address.
Look.
"Dear Dr. Meacham,
"In place of the condensers you ordered,
"we are sending you our AB-619 model.
"We are certain it will interest you.
"Director, Electronic Service, Unit 16."
I thought it was a subsection of Supreme.
Electronic Service, Unit 16.
Well, at least we can find out what they're made of.
A diamond drill, the hardest element we've got.
The bead isn't even scratched.
Experimental lab, Wilson speaking.
Yeah, sure.
Sam wants to talk to you.
He's at the hangar, he's been checking over the plane.
Good.
Hello, Sam.
Sam can't find anything wrong.
Did you double check the controls?
Of course not, I, now, look here, Sam.
All right, Sam, you win.
Maybe I did have just a couple, but, all right.
Good night.
Maybe I should have had a couple.
Maybe I will.
Morning.
Sign here.
Thank you.
What have you got?
I don't know.
There's no return address.
Electronics Service, Unit Number 16.
A catherimine tube with an endiom complex of plus four.
What are they talking about?
I don't know, but this outfit has them.
This isn't paper.
It's some kind of metal.
"Interocitor incorporating planetary generator.
"Interocitor with Volterator.
"With Astrascope."
Here's something my wife could use in the house, an "Interocitor incorporating an electron sorter."
Although she'd probably gain 20 pounds while it did all the work for her.
You know, Joe, according to this, there's no limit to what it can do.
Laying a four-lane highway at the rate of a mile a minute would be a cinch.
Cal, maybe we've been working too hard.
"Complete line of Interocitor parts,
"incorporating greater advances
"than hitherto known in the field of electronics."
What exactly is an Interocitor?
I don't know.
And I don't want to know.
Well, I do.
I want to know what it is and what it does.
Order the list of parts on these pages.
How are we gonna build it?
These symbols, they're like a foreign language.
And anyway, we don't know the address.
Well, you ordered the condensers from Supreme by teletype.
Yeah?
Which means that somebody intercepted that order and sent us those beads.
Here, try it again.
You're too darn smart.
I may be the dumbest man who ever walked this Earth, Joe.
Here's the invoice.
No charge and no address.
And listen to this,
"No Interocitor part can be replaced.
"Bear this in mind while assembling."
Well, let's start unpacking.
There's 2,486 parts.
Each part is cross-indexed into a symbol pattern.
Shouldn't be too hard at all.
Sure.
A snap, maestro.
Only, where do we start?
Right here.
You know what my kids would say.
Dig this crazy, mixed-up plumbing!
Plug it in, Joe.
We'll see what happens.
Now what do I do?
Clear your screen, please.
You can hear me?
Of course.
Use the intensifier disk.
The one in your hand.
Place it in position on your right.
Now turn the control
18 degrees to the left.
You have successfully accomplished your task, Dr. Meacham.
You've assembled an Interocitor, a feat of which few men are capable.
Who are you?
I'm called Exeter.
I'm a scientist like yourself
Shall we say, a colleague.
My colleagues don't materialize out of strange machines.
They're flesh and blood.
And so am I, Dr. Meacham, as I hope you'll soon find out.
Although I admit at the moment, I do appear immaterial.
But no matter.
I represent a group which is seeking scientists of exceptional ability.
All prospects must pass an aptitude test, which you've just done.
I'm flattered.
Only I don't remember applying for any job.
You didn't.
I beg your pardon, Mr. Wilson.
Your camera will pick up nothing but black fog.
Images on the Interocitor don't register on film.
Put it away, Joe.
To continue, Dr. Meacham, we test out people without their knowledge.
We leave nothing to chance.
Except the chance that I'm not interested in you or your group.
Come, come, Doctor, it's not possible that a man of your scientific curiosity wouldn't want to find out who I am, where I come from.
Wouldn't give his right arm for more examples of our superior technical knowledge.
I think I can assume, Dr. Meacham, that you're sufficiently intrigued to come to an immediate decision.
We'd like you to join our team, as you might say, at once.
You'll make arrangements to leave immediately.
Wait a moment.
I didn't say...
At five o'clock Wednesday morning our plane will land at your field.
It will wait exactly five minutes and then depart.
Whether I'm aboard or not?
Place the catalog on that table with the blueprints.
Now stand aside, please.
You too, Mr. Wilson.
Just a minute.
Please step back or you maybe harmed.
Further back.
You okay?
Okay, within reason.
If there is any reason around here.
There's no reading now.
Cal.
Yes, Joe?
Whatever that Exeter is, I don't like it.
Don't you, Joe?
He was right about one thing.
I'm gonna be on that plane.
Cal, won't you reconsider?
I did, all night.
And as a committee of one,
I came to a series of decisions at exactly the fifth cup of coffee.
One, whatever scientific knowledge this Exeter character has should be in our textbooks.
Two, Joe Wilson, my able assistant, knows enough about a certain experiment to carry on without me for a while.
I'm not sure of that, Cal.
Look, Joe, my committee decided I'm expendable.
Nothing you can say will change that.
You always were an obstinate, oh, well, I'm not worried.
Not even a moth equipped with a lightning bug could fly in here this morning, so no plane is...
He made it.
No pilot.
No windows.
Cal, you'll really be flying blind.
Please be seated, Dr. Meacham.
And welcome aboard.
A seat belt is not required, Doctor.
Please clear the stairs.
Thank you.
So long, Joe.
I'll be dropping you a card.
Cal, get off, right away!
This whole thing smells to high heaven!
Cal, I'm begging you!
Don't go!
Please, don't go!
Good morning, Dr. Meacham.
Hope you slept well.
We'll be landing shortly.
Good morning.
Good morning.
Where am I?
Georgia.
I kind of expected Neptune or Mars.
Exeter asked me to greet you.
I'm Dr. Ruth Adams.
Ruth Adams!
But this is wonderful!
I never expected,
Ruth, I'm Cal Meacham.
Cal.
Dr. Meacham, of course.
Four or five years ago, conference on thermal problems in nuclear reactors.
Boston, wasn't it?
Vermont.
We were lecturing to a symposium of graduate students.
Summer, three years ago.
After classes we'd go swimming in a little river near the school.
You were an awful sissy about that icy water.
Oh, Ruth, don't tell me you've forgotten.
Dr. Meacham, all I can say is I'm deeply flattered, and maybe a little envious of the girl you've mistaken me for.
And now I think Exeter is waiting to greet you.
I'm sure you must be puzzled, Doctor.
I'll never forget my own feelings on the day of my arrival.
Exeter isn't exactly conventional in his hiring methods.
Or his choice of personnel.
I think that sounds like rather a personal dig.
Once you're at the club,
I'm sure you'll like us much better.
The club?
That's what we like to call it.
Exeter has spared nothing for our comfort or facilities for our work.
Inside looks better, Doctor.
They'll bring your bags in.
Your plane.
The elevators down to
Exeter's slave quarters.
Our laboratories.
Our living room, social center, library.
This is Exeter's office and study.
Not exactly what you expected, Dr. Meacham, is it?
Good morning, Doctor.
Good morning, Doctors.
Give me your coat.
Good morning, Herr doctor.
Good morning.
Engelborg, from Munich.
The Doctor's out for his morning constitutional.
He's been here a week, but his English and my German...
Who's that one?
That's Brack, one of
Exeter's assistants.
But you'll find them all very helpful.
What language do they speak?
Anything you wish.
English, Hindustani, Congolese.
Anything.
Dr. Meacham.
Good morning.
Good morning.
Please come in.
Both of you.
Sit down.
Dr. Adams.
Oh, yes, Steve.
About that nuclear decay factor, Ruth,
I'm afraid my equation just doesn't seem to work.
I was hoping you could find time to go over it with me later.
I still think the basic principle is all right.
And maybe we can trust...
Yes, well, thank you, Dr. Adams.
Oh, there you are, Dr. Adams.
I was just reminding Dr. Meacham that I had promised to produce some of his colleagues in the flesh.
May I use you as my exhibit A?
I'm afraid Dr. Meacham isn't too happy with me.
At the airport, he was sure we were old friends.
Obviously I was wrong.
The lady hardly remembers me.
What is more important is...
Who we are, what we're doing here.
Dr. Meacham,
I represent a group of scientists who work with but one purpose, to put an end to war.
Naturally, such a goal can't be attained without experts of superior ability, men of vision.
Men such as you, Doctor, gathered here, exchanging information daily, putting aside all thoughts of personal success.
We hope to achieve exciting new techniques, leap years ahead of the others.
I don't think I need tell you how effective our voices will be when the world learns of our achievements.
Well, there you have it.
Nothing new, perhaps, but then, what is?
However, let me assure you, Doctor, that we are dedicated men and women, and as such we can accomplish wonders.
Well?
What do you think of us?
This all sounds great,
Mr. Exeter, but why me?
Dr. Meacham, we happen to know that you are on the threshold of discovering limitless amounts of free nuclear energy.
More specifically, the conversion of lead into uranium.
Dr. Adams here has been working along the same lines as you have.
Perhaps just a step behind you.
Although I might add that both of you are way ahead of anyone else in your field.
Be careful.
Exeter will flatter you to death.
The truth is never flattering, Dr. Adams.
Now, suppose you relax and think it over.
Suppose when I do, I find
I can't go along with you?
Naturally, we'll expect you to be discreet about what you've seen here.
Otherwise, you are free to leave, Dr. Meacham.
As free as air.
And now, suppose we continue your tour of inspection, right from our chairs.
Conserving energy is one of our primary concerns, isn't it, Doctor?
Your laboratory, Doctor.
Immediately below this office, I believe.
Still under construction, but, in a few days, well, we'll have some surprises for you.
Brack?
Everything in order?
Yes.
Thank you, Brack.
Any reason why you can't start in the morning, Doctor?
No.
Another view of your laboratory, with your own Interocitor, of course.
In addition to which, we hope to provide you with...
One of our other units calling, Doctor.
Other units?
Yes, we have several at strategic points throughout the world.
Please forgive me.
We'll have a chat at dinner, Meacham.
Excellent cuisine, by the way.
Like everybody here, the chef must be dedicated to his work.
You'll find the stairway through the living room and to your right.
Your room is at the top of the stairs.
Thanks.
Dr. Meacham.
I'm still sorry I wasn't the girl in Vermont.
Yes?
Your progress report
I find is unsatisfactory.
You are failing to meet the schedule as planned.
Why?
Because certain methods imposed upon me by the council have not been effective here.
I wish to discuss it with the council.
Impossible.
The time element will not permit any dissenting opinions.
You will carry on with
Plan A as instructed.
Now, please report on status of personnel.
With the arrival of Meacham, the personnel roster is complete.
Proceed with Plan A.
What do you think of Mr. Mozart, Exeter?
I'm afraid I don't know the gentleman.
My mind must have been wandering.
Your composer, of course.
Our composer?
He belongs to the world.
Yes, indeed.
The dinner, Exeter, was even more perfect than you promised.
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I could do with some fresh air myself.
Would you care to join me, Dr. Adams?
You, Dr. Carlson?
Why don't you?
Show him the grounds.
We won't start cracking the whip on Meacham until tomorrow.
That's quite a group
Exeter has collected.
Quite.
That's Dr. Hu Ling Tang.
Tang's field is titanium, the same as Dr. Engelborg.
Dr. Marie Pitchener, U-235.
Dr. Blorfield, plutonium.
Hmm, that puts all of us in the production of nuclear energy, doesn't it, Carlson?
What are you getting at, Meacham?
Why no biochemists?
Electronic experts, mechanical engineers?
People equipped to make practical application of the energy the rest of us produce.
I seem to remember that was part of Exeter's pitch.
We try to make it a rule around here, Doctor, not to discuss our work after hours.
Now, how about that fresh air?
How about you and Dr. Adams showing me my laboratory instead?
After all I've heard today,
I can hardly wait to add my little contribution to the good work.
This way, Doctor.
Your lab and my lab are in this wing.
Steve and the others are on the right.
This is yours, over here.
It's only Neutron.
We call him that because he's so positive.
Stay off Dr. Meacham's equipment.
Well, what do you think of it?
It's not bad.
Should be able to get started very quickly.
Fine, but a word of warning.
Don't let Exeter push you too hard.
He's the kind of man who wants results yesterday.
This is the same size lead slab I use in my own lab.
I guess you're right.
I guess Exeter doesn't expect me to waste any time.
This is very interesting.
Now, standing here with the lead slab in front of us, the lead reactor panel behind us, we're shielded from nuclear rays.
Could be even from the prying eyes of Exeter's Interocitor.
What's your opinion, Doctors?
All right, I'll spell it out for you.
The two of you walk around here as if you're scared of your own shadows.
Ruth's even afraid to admit she and I once might have held hands.
Well, that's okay with me.
But either I've got to figure I'm a little cracked, or that Exeter's cat has got both your tongues.
You ever stop to think that we have a right to throw a few questions at you, Meacham?
What are you doing here?
Look, I received a darn fool catalog.
I couldn't resist it.
I built an Interocitor, arrived on that trick plane and that's all I know.
But so help me, in the next 10 minutes,
I'm gonna know a lot more.
I believe him, Steve.
Well, I guess I do, too.
Now we're getting somewhere.
To begin with, Cal,
I was the girl in Vermont.
Then why all of that...
Because we couldn't take a chance.
There's always the possibility you spent a few minutes under one of Exeter's sun lamps before you got here.
Sun lamp?
That's what it looks like.
Only instead of a sun tan, you get your brain cells rearranged.
Steve had a peek at one.
Yeah, it's similar to a lobotomy.
Renders useless certain areas of the brain.
Those areas controlling the power of the will.
Up until now, Steve and I have been spared.
We think Engelborg, too, but we haven't the slightest idea why.
And what about the others?
Try talking to them.
Well, that leaves the big one.
Who's Exeter working for?
We don't know.
All we do know is what you've already guessed.
Exeter is desperately trying to come up with new sources of atomic energy.
And we're the geniuses he's depending upon to deliver for him.
Well, he might get a surprise.
Why did you wait, Brack?
You should have told me.
I was busy elsewhere.
If you're so concerned, why don't you let me use the transformer?
The transformer is not the only answer.
The council differs.
It says it's infallible.
The council is wrong.
I told the Monitor so today.
The transformer is morally abhorrent to the subjects.
It sets up subconscious blocks which defeat our very purposes.
You're being sentimental.
I am being practical!
No, Brack.
Use a machine to control a man's brain, you destroy his initiative.
You destroy his power to help us, as we need help.
We can both see it right here.
It maybe true, but are you sure?
We're 30 miles from nowhere.
Steve and I know, we've tried.
And if we did get out, who'd believe all this?
I don't blame you doctors for being excited about working for Exeter.
It's a rare privilege.
He's a rare man.
Our little Neutron gave us away.
He felt the impulses.
That cat, I could...
Put Neutron under the thought transformer?
Why not, Brack?
And perhaps you'd like me to step in with him.
Turn it off, Brack.
Our friends won't be giving us any more information tonight.
And the log of 236 plus
1.008 to the ninth.
It's an interesting equation.
I'll check it.
You may find it'll help you over some of the more difficult obstacles, Meacham.
And now, Doctor, I'd like to acquaint you with another of our accomplishments.
Notice that section of lead plate behind you.
Please bring it forward, about eight feet.
Now, please move back.
By the door, Doctor.
When your lead-to-uranium process is working properly, the effectiveness of this ray will be increased enormously.
Tell me, Exeter, why should a communication device be equipped with a destructive ray?
Television waves can't penetrate mountains.
With the aid of neutrino rays, we can.
Neutrino rays?
You've just observed one in action.
I suppose the neutrino could be described as the missing link between energy and matter.
Fascinating, if destruction is our goal.
On the contrary.
Just recently, one of our rays was used for quite another purpose.
More specifically, to save your life.
The green light?
Exactly.
Picking your plane up in midair and conveying it safely to Earth.
After it first immobilized my controls.
Meacham, I must ask you to have faith in our ultimate aims.
I must also ask you to refrain from meeting with any of your co-workers again, except in our usual channels.
Any way you want it.
Very good, Doctor.
And your patience, I promise you, will be rewarded.
Here's a sketch of the Interocitor.
I also have rough notes on its working controls.
It's guesswork, mostly, but better than nothing.
And these are portraits of Exeter and Brack.
Do you notice the peculiar indentations in both their foreheads?
Coincidental, no doubt.
And this is the one we're really proud of, Cal.
We discovered this about a week ago, two miles south of here.
The side of this hill has been hollowed out.
And here's an acre of canvas covering the excavation.
You tell me what's in there.
Steve wanted to go back and find out what was inside, but I guess I got cold feet.
Just like Vermont, still a sissy.
They're fine, Steve.
When we get out of here,
I'll have them framed at my own expense.
If we get out.
He's just hungry.
Goodbye, Neutron.
Confirm, please.
Plan A abandoned.
Alternate plan in effect.
Correct.
Our ionization layer is failing rapidly.
We may need transportation.
Are you prepared to leave?
We have been since your last communication.
Although Meacham and Adams are achieving positive results.
Can you give us another time period?
Impossible, but it is hoped that you will be able to complete the project here.
Bring them.
Good.
You will keep in contact until moment of departure, then remove all evidence of installation.
That is all.
Take over.
What is it?
Something I've seen before.
Get off the road, quick!
They're playing with us.
We're sitting ducks in this thing.
If we're gonna make the airport, we'll have to do it on foot.
When I stop, we'll pile out.
Take cover, fast.
Steve!
Steve!
We've got to get out of here.
Get down!
Get away!
We'll try and make the airport.
Let's go.
Is it flyable?
It should be.
Exeter keeps it here for the staff.
They're pulling us up.
Remain here.
I want a report on temperature control immediately, and use extreme caution through the thermal barrier.
Our two passengers are very sensitive to heat.
The passengers are here.
Allow me to welcome you.
I'm sorry that our visit below had to be terminated so dramatically, but time allowed for nothing else.
I can assure you, we mean you no harm.
Like Steve Carlson and Engelborg?
Like the others in that house?
What happened was beyond my control.
What happened was mass murder.
We're not all masters of our souls, Meacham.
That's a nice little phrase, coming from you.
I learned it on Earth.
Look, the two of you are beginning a strange journey.
A journey that no Earth people have ever undertaken before.
Now, whether you consider me a devil or a saint is unimportant.
What is important is that you're here on this spaceship.
Suppose then, for the time being, we call a truce.
As scientists at least, Meacham.
Ruth, don't tell me that as a woman you're not curious about our destination.
Where are we going?
To a planet we call Metaluna.
Metaluna?
There's no such planet in the solar system.
Metaluna lies far beyond your solar system, in outer space.
The Stellar Scope will convince you.
Come.
Observer, prepare a view of the second quadrant, please.
I won't ask you to condone what we've done.
All I ask is that, when you understand the plight of my people, you try to have more sympathy for our deeds.
Earth.
It's being left far behind.
Cal, it's getting hard to breathe.
We're going through the thermal barrier.
I'm afraid you'll find the temperature unpleasant for a short time.
Prepare to leave Earth's orbit.
All conversion must be completed during this time period.
Follow me, if you will.
Exeter, what are you using for power?
How are you controlling the fantastic temperature on this ship?
What's to prevent us from floating around like a bunch of balloons once we get away from Earth's gravity?
Well, to answer the last question first.
We create our own gravitational field, which means that no matter what position our ship takes in space, we here inside remain right-side-up.
But, at the moment, if we're going to get you to Metaluna alive, there's a little procedure you'll have to go through.
What are you doing to them?
Metaluna's atmospheric pressure is like that in your greatest oceans.
If we entered Metaluna's orbit without conversion, we'd be crushed to death.
Then in going from Metaluna to Earth, the tissues of our bodies would dwindle.
We'd disintegrate completely.
Correct, Meacham.
If we're fortunate enough to return to Earth.
Brack!
Yes?
You will prepare the doctors for the tubes.
You'll change into clothes such as ours, especially conditioned for life on Metaluna.
Come with me.
Place your hands above the rails.
They're magnetized.
There's an intercom system in the tubes.
You may converse as long as you're able to.
Ruth?
Yes?
You okay?
And you?
Feel like a new toothbrush.
Ruth.
Cal.
Approaching enemy-control sector.
This is Master Control awaiting instructions.
We'll energize only as necessary.
Conserve power.
Avoid contact with enemy until safety of ship is in danger.
You'll feel stronger in a few moments.
Now, I know you both feel as though you could sleep for at least 1,000 years, but then you would miss observing our approach to Metaluna.
And with your curiosity, you'd never forgive me for that.
I don't understand.
What don't you understand, Doctor?
Those two objects, they appear to be comets, but their paths are identical, almost as though some intelligence were controlling them.
Your deduction is quite correct, Doctor.
Although the objects are not comets, they're meteors controlled by spacecraft of Zagon.
They're gonna hit us, they're gonna hit us!
We've offered to make peace with Zagon, but to no avail.
Is Zagon a planet?
A planet that was once a comet, as you can see.
Their spacecraft are actually guiding the meteors against us.
Now on fourth quadrant.
Metaluna contact in three time periods.
Observer, a closer view.
View in third quadrant.
Contact in two time periods.
View in second quadrant.
Contact in one time period.
View in first quadrant at ionization layer.
What you're observing may well be the beginning of the end for our world.
The Zagon meteors are beginning to get through our ionized layer.
That haze, a field of intense radiation.
As you can well imagine, such a screen requires the output of great amounts of atomic energy.
And you're running out, that's why you were sent to Earth.
And why you sent for us.
You need uranium.
In gigantic quantities.
Our own deposits are exhausted.
As our power diminishes, our protection fails.
That's enough, normal view.
Entering ionized layer.
Metaluna.
Brack, remove the equipment of our two doctors to turbine center.
Have it all set up for immediate use.
Oh, Brack, I'm sure personnel will need everyone.
Have the crew report immediately for reassignment.
Now, we must report to the Monitor.
Step in.
Our means of interior transportation.
Before the war forced us to move inside of our planet, these tubes covered the surface of our Earth.
Our educational complexes.
Now, rubble.
Over there was a recreation center.
This way.
The Monitor's structure.
Welcome, Exeter.
Observed your flight.
Almost counted you lost.
Your Earth creatures.
Dr. Adams.
Dr. Meacham.
The Monitor, the supreme head of our government.
Regrettable, there is no time for amenities.
I am certain your minds have difficulty grasping this transition from Earth to Metaluna.
I have given them as much indoctrination as possible.
Then you know that shortly we can expect Zagon to commence and sustain an all-out attack.
Our ionization layer must be maintained until our relocation is effected.
Relocation?
To where?
To your Earth.
A peaceful relocation.
We hope to live in harmony with the citizens of your Earth.
In harmony?
Our knowledge and weapons would make us your superiors, naturally.
Then why haven't your superior brains solved the problem of synthesizing uranium?
Most of our scientists are dead.
Our major laboratories, destroyed.
The war has reduced our population to a mere handful.
That is true, Meacham.
It is indeed typical that you Earth people refuse to believe in the superiority of any world but your own.
Children looking into a magnifying glass, imagining the image you see is the image of your true size.
Our true size is the size of our God.
Do you still insist, Exeter, that we can allow any of these Earth creatures to have free minds?
I do.
I know them.
I have lived with them.
You have wasted our time.
Take them to the thought-transference chamber.
Please come with me,
I'm afraid you have no choice.
Interocitor control, hear me. lonization failing at prime sector.
Use emergency power and repel attack.
Power transfer will begin immediately.
Our Zagon friends seem to be hitting this prime sector quite regularly.
Is that where it is, in there?
My mind is my own and nobody's gonna change it.
I'm not going into that room.
Nobody is, come on.
I'm sorry.
I'd hoped to have prepared you somewhat beforehand.
This is a mutant.
We've been breeding them here for ages to do menial work.
Well, actually, they're similar to some of the insect life on your own planet, larger, of course, with a higher degree of intelligence.
This one has been given orders to guard this corridor as long as we're here.
I beg of you, go inside, cooperate voluntarily.
If you do, I give you my word that you will not be harmed or your minds changed in any way.
You'd defy the Monitor?
I already have.
Do you believe him, Cal?
In this place, I wouldn't believe my grandmother.
Come on.
The travel cart, come on!
Where are we going?
The spaceship, at least it's safer there.
Don't you understand?
Let it happen now.
Meacham!
Ruth!
Stand back, Exeter.
Meacham, believe me, I wanna help you.
Time is short.
Get into the car.
He appears badly hurt.
Stay close to me.
Stand back.
I command you, stand back!
Cal!
Are you badly hurt?
I'll be all right.
Close off all hatches.
Control room, quick.
I'm all right.
Ruth, activate the Stellar Scope, right control, 45 degrees left.
Our ionization layer has failed completely.
Will we be able to get out?
Depends on the amount of energy we have left.
If we have to ward off any heavy Zagon attacks,
I don't know.
That may be the last of them.
Yes.
They're concentrating all their attention on Metaluna.
Those flashes of light, they're meteors, hundreds of them.
The intense heat is turning
Metaluna into a radioactive sun.
The temperature must be thousands of degrees by now.
A lifeless planet.
And yet, yet still serving a useful purpose, I hope.
Yes, a sun.
Warming the surface of some other world.
Giving light to those who may need it.
Now, into the converter tubes.
Ruth, you take the first tube.
You, the next.
What about you?
I'll use the third tube.
Exeter, are these tubes strong enough to keep him out?
Possibly, he's bleeding badly.
In a very few moments, the pressure should destroy him.
Run, Ruth, run!
Our speed is diminishing.
We're now in the atmosphere of Earth.
Your plane is where you left it, in the cargo hold.
A conventional way for you to return to Earth, I admit, but perhaps the most practical.
Where are you going?
Our universe is vast, full of wonders.
I'll explore, perhaps find another Metaluna.
A place inhabited by beings not unlike myself.
You see, I'm more adventurous than you imagined me.
Exeter, you're a liar.
You've used all your power bringing us here.
Even if you had a place to go, you couldn't make it.
Come with us.
We'll heal your wounds.
I'm afraid my wounds can never be healed.
You've things to teach us.
Thank you.
We're over your Earth now.
It's time for you to go.
Farewell.
Home.
Thank God, it's still here.
- Oh, Dr. Hill.
- Dr. Bassett.
Where's the patient?
- I hated to drag you out of bed at this time of night.
- Will you let me go while there's still time?
- You'll soon see why I did.
Doc, will you tell these fools I'm not crazy?
Make them listen to me before it's too late.
- I'll listen to you.
Let him go.
- Who are you?
- I'm Dr. Hill from the state mental hospital.
- I'm not insane.
- Let him go.
- Listen, doctor, now you must listen to me.
You must understand me.
I'm a doctor, too.
I am not insane.
I am not insane.
- Alright, alright.
Now suppose we just sit down over here Dr. Bennell and you tell me what happened?
- Well, it started.
For me it started last Thursday.
In response to an urgent message from my nurse,
I'd hurried home from a medical convention I'd been attending.
At first glance, everything looked the same.
It wasn't.
Something evil had taken possession of the town.
These two.
Here you are.
- Thank you, sir.
There you are.
- Thank you.
Morning, Mr. Fisher.
- Doc.
- Hiya, Sally.
- Hi.
Welcome home I'm glad you're back.
- How's Mickey and the baby?
- They're fine but it seems that everybody else in Santa
Mira needs a doctor.
You've got an office full of patients.
- Oh, no, on my first day back?
- Well, some of them been waiting for two weeks.
- Why didn't you send them to Percy or Carmichael like I told you to?
- Most of them wouldn't go.
They wanna see you.
- Oh.
What's the matter with them?
- They wouldn't say.
You know usually people can't talk enough about what's ailing them.
For instance Wally Eberhard was in twice and called three times about something, but he wouldn't tell me what it was.
- That's funny.
- Neither would anyone else from Becky Driscoll down to that fat traffic cop Sam Janzek.
- Becky Driscoll.
I thought she was in England.
- She got back a few days ago, and she wanted to see you.
Are you still interested?
- My interest in married women is strictly professional or yours would have been a lost cause long ago.
- How was the convention?
- Wonderful.
They wept with envy when I read my paper.
- Jimmy, come back here.
Jimmy.
- What's the matter, Mrs. Grimaldi?
- It's nothing he just don't wanna go to school.
- If I were you I'd have a talk with his teacher.
- I will when I get time.
- What's the matter has Joe been sick?
- No, we gave the stand up too much work.
- Oh.
The boy's panic should have told me it was more than school he was afraid of and that littered, closed-up vegetable stand should have told me something, too.
When I last saw it less than a month ago, it was the cleanest and busiest stand on the road.
- That's strange.
She was in to see you too last Friday.
I tried to get her to go see
Doc Percy but she wouldn't.
She said only you could help her.
- Well, whatever it was it couldn't have been too serious I guess.
One minor concussion, two cases of the common cold and six canceled appointments.
Looks like you rushed me here for nothing.
- I don't understand it, Miles.
They couldn't wait to see you.
But you're still booked up solid for the afternoon.
- I bet they don't show.
Look there's Wally Eberhard talking somebody into buying some insurance.
There's nothing wrong with him.
Bill Bitner's taking his secretary to lunch.
And speaking of lunch will you tell whoever that is that I'm out having mine?
- Is Dr. Bennell in?
- Yes, he's here.
- Do you suppose he has time to see me a moment?
- Well, if he hasn't something's wrong with him.
Go right in.
- Becky.
Almost five years.
- It's wonderful to be home again.
I've been away so long I feel almost like a stranger in my own country.
Hope you don't mind my coming without an appointment.
- Not at all.
What'll you have?
We're pushing appendectomies this week.
- Oh, Miles.
- I don't know maybe I clown around too much.
Pretty soon my patients won't trust me to prescribe aspirin for them.
Seriously, what's the trouble?
- It's my cousin.
- Wilma.
What's the matter with her?
- She has a...
Well, I guess you'd call it a delusion.
You know her uncle, Uncle Ira?
- Sure I'm his doctor.
- Well, Miles she's got herself thinking he isn't her uncle.
- How do you mean that they're not really related?
- No, she thinks he's an impostor or something someone who only looks like Ira.
- Have you seen him?
- I just came from there.
- Well, is he Uncle Ira or isn't he Uncle Ira?
- Of course he is I told
Wilma that but it was no use.
Please, would you stop by and have a talk with her?
- Well, Sally says that I'm booked up for the afternoon but why don't you ask her to come in and see me?
- I'll try.
- How about some lunch?
- I can't I'm meeting dad at the store.
- When did you get back?
- I came back from London two months ago.
I've been in Reno.
- Reno.
- Reno.
Dad tells me you were there, too.
- Five months ago.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- So was I.
I wanted it to work.
Well, I guess that makes us lodge brothers now.
- Yes.
- Except that I'm paying dues while you collect them.
- Miles.
- Hello, Jordan.
- How are you?
Sam.
- Hello, doc.
- At it again, eh?
My nurse tells me you were in last week and wanted very much to see me.
- It wasn't anything important.
- Say, didn't he go to college with us?
- Quit his second year to get married like I wanted us to do.
- Just be thankful I didn't take you seriously.
- You be thankful.
I found out that a doctor's wife needs the understanding of an Einstein and patience of a saint.
- And love?
- I wouldn't know about that.
I'm just a general practitioner.
Love is handled by the specialists.
- Well, here's where I leave you.
- You know something this is where you left me the last time.
Hiya, Johnny.
Sally, I'm off.
Will you tell the answering service I'll be at home?
- Good night, doc.
- Goodnight.
- I'm not going in there.
- You're gonna listen to me stop all this nonsense and be a good boy come on.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey take it easy.
Isn't this Jimmy Grimaldi?
- Yes, doctor, can I talk to you a moment?
- Sure you know I almost ran you down this morning.
You've gotta be careful when you run out in the road.
- Come on now.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey slow down now.
Look school isn't as bad as all that.
- School isn't what upsets him.
It's my daughter-in-law.
He's got the crazy idea she isn't his mother.
- She isn't. She isn't.
Don't let her get me.
- Nobody's gonna get you, Jimmy.
- How long has this been going on?
- An hour ago I found him hiding in the cellar having hysterics.
He wouldn't tell me anything until I started to phone his mother.
That's when he said
Anna wasn't his mother.
- Could you keep him with you for a day or so?
- Of course.
- Give him one of these every four hours during the day.
Call me tomorrow and let me know how he's feeling.
- Yes, doctor, thank you.
- Don't let her get me.
- Nobody's gonna get you, Jimmy.
- All right, Jimmy, open your mouth.
Shut your eyes.
In the words of the poet
I'll give you something to make you wise.
- That's a good boy, Jimmy.
- I'm not going home ever.
- You're gonna stay at your grandmother's house.
Will you call his mother and tell her that--
- She's not my mother.
- Alright, alright, alright run along, run along.
Everything's gonna be alright.
You be a good boy now go on, alright.
- Good bye, doctor.
- Good night.
Sally, I've changed my mind.
I'm not going directly home.
I'm going to stop off and see Wilma Lentz.
- Should I call the boy's mother?
- Yes, call her and tell her what happened and that I suggested it might be a good idea if the boy spend the night at his grandmother's house.
- Hello, Miles.
- Nice to see you, Wilma, Becky.
- Let's have it.
You talked to him what do you think?
- It's him.
He's your Uncle Ira, alright.
- He is not.
- How is he different?
- That's just it there is no difference you can actually see.
He looks, sounds, acts, and remembers like Uncle Ira.
- Then he is your Uncle Ira.
Can't you see that?
No matter how you feel he is.
- But he isn't there's something missing.
He's been a father to me since I was a baby.
Always when he talked to me there was a special look in his eye.
That look's gone.
- What about memories?
There must be certain things that only you and he would know about.
- There are I've talked to him about them.
He remembers them all down to the last small detail just like Uncle Ira would.
But, Miles, there's no emotion.
None just the pretense of it.
The words, gesture, the tone of voice everything else is the same but not the feeling.
Memories or not he isn't my Uncle Ira.
Wilma, I'm on your side.
My business is people in trouble, and I'm gonna find a way to help you.
Now no one could possibly impersonate your Uncle Ira without you or your Aunt Eleda or even me seeing a million little differences.
I want you to realize that.
Think about it, and then you'll know that the trouble is inside you.
- Wilma, where are you?
- Out on the lawn.
Say nothing to her.
- Why, Miles, I didn't know you were here.
Welcome home.
- Hello, Mrs. Lentz.
- Did you ask Miles to stay for dinner?
- Can't tonight.
- I'm making spoon bread.
- Please, don't tempt me.
- Well, maybe next time.
Wilma, where are my glasses?
- I think I saw them on the mantelpiece.
I'll go with you.
- Miles, am I going crazy?
Don't spare me I've got to know.
- No, you're not.
Even these days it isn't as easy to go crazy as you might think.
But you don't have to be losing your mind to need psychiatric help.
I'd like you to see a doctor friend of mine.
- A psychiatrist?
- Dan Kauffman.
I'll make an appointment for you tomorrow.
- Alright.
But it's a waste of time.
There's nothing wrong with me.
We better break this up or he'll start wondering.
- Wondering what?
- If I don't suspect.
You've been a big help.
I don't want you to worry about him me or you either I'll be alright.
- Sure you will.
Staying here, Becky, or may I drive you home?
- Would you like me to stay?
- Of course not.
Good night.
- Good night.
- Nice having Becky back again, eh, boy?
- Sure is.
In the back of my mind a warning bell was ringing.
Sick people who couldn't wait to see me then suddenly were perfectly alright.
A boy who said his mother wasn't his mother.
A woman who said her uncle wasn't her uncle.
But I didn't listen.
Obviously, the boy's mother was his mother.
I'd seen her.
And Uncle Ira was Uncle Ira.
There was no doubt of that after I talked to him.
- Miles, he is Ira?
- Of course he is what do you mean?
- It's just that Wilma's so positive.
Will she be all right?
- I think so.
I'm a doctor according to my diploma but I don't really know what Wilma's trouble is.
I could start talking psychiatrical jargon but it's out of my line and in Dan Kauffman's.
I wish you didn't have to go home for dinner.
- I don't.
Dad's eating out with a friend.
I could pick you up at 7:00.
- Well.
- It's summer and the moon is full, and I know a bank where
- the wild thyme grows.
- You haven't changed a bit.
- Whup, whoa watch out.
- Sorry.
Hey, Miles, when did you get back?
- This morning how are you, Danny?
This is Miss Driscoll.
Dr. Kauffman our one and only psychiatrist.
- How do you do.
- Watch out what you say.
Ed, you remember Becky.
- I should I brought her into the world.
- You did us all a favor.
- Hello, Dr. Percy.
- This saves me a phone call.
I've got a mixed up kid and a woman who need a witch doctor.
- The boy says his father isn't his father and the woman says her sister isn't her sister?
- That's pretty close.
I knew you'd been studying hypnosis, but when did you start reading minds?
- He doesn't have to read them.
I've sent him a dozen patients since it started.
- What is it?
What's going on?
- I don't know a strange neurosis evidently contagious, an epidemic of mass hysteria.
In two weeks it spread all over town.
- What causes it?
- Worry about what's going on in the world probably.
- Make room for Wilma Lentz tomorrow will you Danny?
Send her in around 2:00.
Good night.
- So long, Danny.
Well, this is the oddest thing I ever heard of.
Let's hope we don't catch it.
I'd hate to wake up some morning and find out that you weren't you.
- I'm not the high-school kid you used to romance, so how could you tell?
- You really want to know?
- Mm-hmm.
- Mmm, you're Becky Driscoll.
- Hey, Santa Mira's looking up.
- Has ever since you got back.
- Is this an example of your bedside manner, doctor?
- No, ma'am that comes later.
- Evening, doctor.
- What happened to the crowd tonight?
- I don't know it's been this way for two or three weeks now.
- Well, at least we don't have to wait for a table.
- Take your pick in here or here.
- Here, I think.
Shall we?
- Mm-hmm.
- Where's the band?
- Well, business started falling off, so I had to let them go.
There's the jukebox, though.
- Shall we dance?
I hope you didn't let the bartender go.
- I'm the bartender.
Martinis?
- Two, dry.
Very dry.
- Miles, I don't care what Dr. Kauffman says.
I'm worried.
- You are in the capable hands of your personal physician.
- Oh, doctor.
- Ah, there's our evening.
Sorry.
Thanks.
Dr. Bennell.
- Jack Belicec wants you to come to his house right away, doctor.
He says it's urgent.
- Thank you.
Better hold those drinks.
Emergency.
Well, at least they called before we ordered dinner.
How hungry are you?
- I can wait.
- It may be a while.
- I can go with you.
- Sorry, we'll be back later.
There's Jack.
Hello, Jack, what's the matter?
Teddy sick?
- No.
- Miles, thank heaven I thought you'd never get here.
- Well, if you're not sick who is?
- Nobody.
- Well, then why'd you drag me away from my dinner?
- Well, you won't believe it, Miles, until you see it for yourself.
Hello, Becky, good to see you again.
Hi, Becky. Hi Teddy.
Would you be able to forget that you're a doctor a while?
- Why?
- I don't want you to call the police right away.
- Quit acting like a writer what's going on?
- Maybe you can tell me you're the doctor.
Miles, put the light on over the pool table.
Go on pull it down.
Well, what do you make of it?
- Who is he?
- I have no idea.
- Its face, Miles, it's vague.
- It's like the first impression that's stamped on a coin.
It isn't finished.
- You're right.
It has all the features but no details no character, no lines.
- It's no dead man.
Have you got an ink pad around the house?
- There should be one in the desk, why?
- I wanna take the corpse's fingerprints.
- Of course it's a dead man what else could it be?
- I don't know but I've got a feeling that
I know this sounds crazy but if I should do an autopsy
I think I'd find every organ in perfect condition, just as perfect as the body is externally everything in working order.
All set to go hold that down.
These are blank.
- Waiting for the final finished face to be stamped onto it.
- But whose face?
Tell me that.
- I think we could all use a drink.
- Bourbon all right?
- Fine.
- Not for me, thanks.
- Miles, answer me.
Whose face?
- I haven't the slightest idea, honey, have you?
- How tall would you say that thing is?
- Oh, 5'10", thereabout.
- How much does it weigh?
- I don't know it's pretty thin.
Maybe 140 pounds.
- Jack's 5'10" and weighs 140 pounds.
- Teddy, will you stop talking nonsense?
- I'm sorry, darling.
- Come on let's have that hand.
- But it isn't nonsense.
Becky, you don't think it's nonsense, do you?
- Well, of course it is.
Jack's standing here in front of you.
- Of course I am bleeding to death.
Excuse me.
- You know what?
I'm afraid you may live.
Here, this should fix it.
- Miles, don't you think we should we call the police and have them take that dead body out of here?
- I'm afraid it isn't just a dead body.
- Thanks.
- I wonder if.
- What?
- I wonder if there's any connection.
- What do you mean?
- There's something strange going on in Santa Mira.
Dr. Kauffman calls it an epidemic of mass hysteria.
Becky's cousin's got it for one.
She thinks that her uncle and her aunt aren't her uncle and her aunt.
There's several cases of such delusion.
Now this isn't you yet but there is a structural likeness.
It's fantastic but there must be some reason why this thing is in your house.
Would you be willing to sit up with your strange friend and see what his next move is?
If nothing happens by morning call the police.
If something happens call me, will you?
- You know I will.
- Good night take it easy.
- Sure.
- Now nothing's going to happen.
- Good night, honey.
- Well, if it does it'll make a charming, bloodcurdling mystery story.
- I was careful not to let Becky know but for the first time
I was really scared.
Dan Kauffman's explanation of what was wrong in town mass hysteria couldn't explain away that body on Jack's billiard table.
- Come in while I turn the lights on.
- You're a forward wench dragging me into a dark hallway to be kissed.
- I'm dragging you into a dark hallway because I'm scared of the dark tonight.
- In that case I'd better stay and tuck you in.
- That way lies madness.
- What's wrong with madness?
- Madness.
Now good night.
- Well, it's about time you two got home.
- Dad, what are you doing in the basement this time of night?
- Working in my shop.
How about a nightcap, doc?
- No, thanks it's kind of late.
I'll take a rain check.
Good night.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- Good night, Miles.
- Look, Jack, it's you.
It's you.
No, no you mustn't go near it.
Get out of here please
Please.
- Miles.
- What happened, Jack?
- Teddy says the thing at our place is me right down to the cut on my hand.
Sit down, baby.
I didn't wait to look.
- It's alive.
It's alive.
The hand was cut and bleeding.
And the position of the body had changed.
- Here, here, take this.
I'll call Danny Kauffman.
- Hello.
- Hello, Danny.
- Yeah.
- Something's happened and
I've got to see you right away.
Will you get over here as fast as you can?
It's important.
- Oh, okay.
- He's on his way.
I'll make some coffee and be right with you.
- Good deal, Miles, thanks.
Miles, what about Becky.
Do you think she's all right?
- Dad, what are you doing in the basement this time of night?
- Working in my shop.
- I don't know what it was call it a premonition but suddenly I had the feeling that Becky was in danger.
I had to get to her as quickly as possible.
I was going to ring the bell but then I had a hunch
I'd better be careful.
Something was wrong in this house.
Becky.
Becky.
Becky.
- Miles, will you tell me what happened?
- The same thing.
I found another one in the cellar at Becky's house coming to life while I stood there watching it.
It was Becky.
- Yeah, I want to see one of these bodies.
- Alright.
- Now, you're going to bed and you're staying with her.
Put on your clothes we'll go to Jack's first.
Got any coffee around here?
- Yeah, you'll find some in the kitchen.
- He doesn't believe me, Beck.
- He will.
- Somebody's playing games.
- Rough ones.
There's a blood spot.
What you saw was the body of a murdered man.
Did you examine it carefully?
- Yes.
I don't know what's happened to it.
It was not an ordinary body and there wasn't a mark on it.
- I checked it too when
I put it on the table.
There wasn't a scratch.
- You can kill a man by shoving an ice pick into the base of his brain and leave a puncture so small the naked eye can't see it.
- Danny, you're ignoring the fact that this was not a normal body.
You heard what Teddy said about the hand.
- I heard lots of things Teddy said and none of them made sense.
- Alright now hold onto it, pal, I was here too.
So was Miles.
Now look we took his fingerprints.
Look at that tell me why it didn't have any.
- He didn't want any so he took them off with acid.
- Stop trying to rationalize everything will you.
Let's face it we have a mystery on our hands.
- Sure you have a real one.
Whose body was it and where is it now, a completely normal mystery.
Whatever it is it's well within the bounds of human experience and I don't think you ought to make anymore of it.
- I wouldn't if I hadn't looked in Becky's cellar.
How do you explain away the body I saw there?
- I don't think you saw one there.
- You don't think I saw one here either?
- I know you did because three others saw it, too.
- But I dreamed up the second one?
- Doctors can have hallucinations, too.
The mind is a strange and wonderful thing.
I'm not sure it'll ever be able to figure itself out.
Everything else maybe from the atom to the universe everything except itself.
- Nevertheless, I saw Becky's double and the body that we saw here bore an uncomfortable resemblance to Jack.
- Yeah, a mighty uncomfortable.
- Alright let's go on to
Becky's and have a look.
Alright where's your girlfriend's double?
- Okay, skeptic lift the lid.
- There's a body here, alright.
- It's Becky's double.
- It sure is.
- Take another look.
Now you see it, now you don't.
- It was there half-hidden by that blanket.
- You said you saw it there just now.
- I thought I did.
- Why did you come here tonight?
You'd seen a dead man at
Jack's an average-sized man.
The face in death was smooth and unlined bland in expression which often happens.
You had just become aware of a curious, unexplainable, epidemic mass hysteria.
Men, women, and children suddenly convince themselves that their relatives weren't their relatives at all so your mind started playing tricks and reality became unreality.
The dead man became Jack's double in your eyes.
- Look come off it will you, Dan.
- I know, Miles, this all hard to believe, but these things happen even to witch doctors like me.
- I saw her here she was real.
- You saw her alright in every tiny detail as vividly as anyone has ever seen anything but only in your mind.
- Look, Danny, you can talk all night, but you're not gonna convince me.
- What in heaven's name are you doing in my cellar?
- Using it for an office, Mr. Driscoll.
These gentlemen are patients badly in need of psychiatric treatment.
Stop talking nonsense.
- I'm not they've been having nightmares.
- Well, if you're drunk you'd better sober up quick.
The police are on their way here.
- No, we're not drunk.
- Nothing that simple as that.
Pull up a chair.
- Why, you're crazy all of you.
- Hey, what's going on down there?
- Hello, Nick, glad to see you.
You saved these two characters a trip to the station.
They want to report finding a body and losing it.
- Where, when?
At my place about 7:00.
- Why did you wait so long to report it?
You know better than that, doc.
- Yeah, well, it was a curious sort of a body and then it wasn't there anymore.
- I have a good mind to throw you both in jail.
- But if you had seen it you'd understand why we waited.
- Thin man, 5'10", fingerprints burned off with acid
I Just seen it on the slab in the morgue.
It turned up in a burning haystack on Mike Gessner's south pasture two hours ago.
Now break it up.
Go on home.
- Well, you win pick up the marbles.
Good morning.
- Good morning.
Orange juice.
- Thank you.
- How do you like your eggs?
- Any way you'd like.
- Boiled, two minutes?
- Two minutes?
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.
You know dragging you out of bed in the middle of the night was a lot of trouble but it was worth it.
- Seriously, Miles.
What was that?
- Who is it?
- It's the gas man.
Morning, doc.
- Good morning, Charlie.
I guess I'm a little jittery.
Not getting enough sleep.
- Well, I won't be bothering you anymore.
Putting the meter outside on the patio.
- Okay.
- The eggs will be hard-boiled.
- Did you do this for your husband?
- Mm-hmm.
Didn't your wife do this for you?
- Oh, yes, she liked to cook.
That's one of the reasons why I'm single.
I never was there when dinner was on the table.
Well, take my advice and don't get mixed up with a doctor.
They're seldom at home.
- What would you say if I told you
I was already mixed up with a doctor?
- I'd say it was too good to be true.
- Things like this can happen all of a sudden.
- What's all of a sudden about two people who've know each other most of their lives.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
- I thought I smelled some coffee.
Why didn't you give me a call?
- I didn't want to wake Teddy.
- Oh, she's wide-awake.
Got a good sleep.
- Good.
- But I don't feel that she should go home right away, Miles.
Would you mind taking in a couple boarders for a while?
Or do you have something else in mind?
- Well, I was toying with an idea but you can stay.
- Here, Jack.
- Thank you, doll, I'll take it to Teddy.
- Miles, did you make that appointment for me with the psychiatrist?
- Yes, 2:00.
- I don't need him.
I feel like such a fool.
I woke up this morning and everything was alright.
You don't know how relieved I am.
- Yes, I do.
Listen will you call Becky and tell her about it.
She was worried about you.
- Alright.
- She's at my house.
- At your house why?
- Well, it's a long story but she'll tell you about it.
- Becky's still at his house.
- Alright.
- Good morning.
- Morning, Sally.
- Take a peek at what's in the reception room.
- Mother, why don't we go home?
- In a little while, Jimmy.
- He certainly made a quick recovery.
- I guess we all have.
But driving home I had a lot of questions and no answers.
How could Jimmy and
Wilma seem so normal now?
Surely I had done nothing to cure them.
Maybe they wanted me to feel secure but why?
Well.
- I hope you didn't forget the steaks.
- I never forget anything.
- Don't worry about him he's completely housebroken.
- I need a martini, Beck.
- Onion or olive?
- Doesn't matter.
I wanna pour it on the charcoal.
I can't get this stuff to burn.
- A martini isn't dry enough.
I'll get you something to start it.
For drinking purposes.
You're looking shipshape.
- Thank you, sir.
- Here we are.
Jack.
Jack.
- They're like huge seedpods.
- This must be the way that body in my closet was formed.
Miles, where do they come from?
- I don't know.
If they are seeds or seedpods they must grow someplace on a plant probably.
Somebody or something wants this duplication to take place.
- But when they're finished what happens to our bodies?
- I don't know.
When the process is complete probably the original is destroyed or disintegrates.
No, wait.
- I'm sorry but I take a dim view of watching my own destruction take place.
- There isn't any danger until they're completely formed.
We learned that last night at your house.
Your blank didn't change right away.
- Not until you fell asleep.
Miles, when the change does take place do you suppose there's any difference?
- There must be.
Wilma noticed it.
So did little Jimmy.
- So did I.
My father.
- That must be what he was doing in the cellar last night placing one of these I'm sorry.
- I felt something wrong but I thought it was me because I'd been away for so long.
- They have to be destroyed all of them.
- They will be every one of them.
Listen we're gonna have to search every building every house in town.
Men, women, and children are gonna have to be examined.
We've got some phoning to do.
- Well, I'm gonna stay right here where I can watch them.
- I'm gonna staying with you.
- Don't call the police.
Nick Grivett didn't find any body on a burning haystack.
- Why don't you call
Danny maybe he can help.
- Danny.
No, I'm afraid it's too late to call Danny, too.
- Well, what are you gonna do?
- Get help.
I hope whatever's taking place is confined to Santa Mira.
- Operator.
- Hello, this is Dr. Bennell.
This is an emergency I wanna talk to the
Federal Bureau of
Investigation in Los Angeles.
- Can you make them believe you?
- I've got to.
- Where did they come from?
- So much has been discovered these past few years.
That anything is possible.
Maybe the results of atomic radiation on plant life or animal life some weird alien organism, a mutation of some kind.
- Why should they take the form of people of us?
- I don't know, I don't know.
Whatever it is whatever intelligence or instinct it is that can govern the forming of human flesh and blood out of thin air is it's fantastically powerful beyond any comprehension, malignant.
All that body in your cellar needed was a mind, and it was--
- And it was taking mine while I was asleep.
I could take that pitchfork myself.
- On your call to Los Angeles, doctor they don't answer.
- Well, try again.
That office is open day and night.
If they've taken over the telephone office we're dead.
- Is that me?
- This is an emergency, emergency.
Now look there's been...
Operator, get me a better connection.
- I'll try, doctor.
It's no use all the Los
Angeles circuits are dead.
- Alright try Sacramento.
Give me the state capital I wanna talk to the governor.
- The Sacramento circuits are busy, doctor.
I'll call you back.
- Alright.
Alright I'll wait for your call.
I'll take the phone outside.
Jack, they've got the phone.
Now you and the girls get in your car and make a run for it.
First town you get to yell for help.
- What about you?
- In a little while that phone is gonna ring soon.
If there's nobody here to answer it, they'll know we've gone and blocked the roads out of town.
I'll stall them till you're out of reach.
- Well, then what are you gonna do?
- Try and find out what's in back of this.
- I'm staying.
- No.
- Miles, don't ask me to leave you.
- Jack, get going.
- Miles, I can't--
- Look somebody's got to go or we don't get help.
- Please, let's get out of here.
- Watch out for yourselves.
- Go over by the phone stay there.
If it rings call me.
- Hello.
- Is Dr. Bennell there?
- Yes, I'll get him.
- Never mind.
Just tell him the Sacramento circuits are still busy and ask him if he wants me to keep trying.
- Alright, hold on.
Miles, the circuits are still busy.
- Well, tell her to keep trying.
Also try San Francisco and Washington.
We're getting out of here right now.
- Where are we going?
- Sally's.
- We're still unable to get through to Los Angeles.
Do you wish me to keep trying?
Dr. Bennell.
Dr. Bennell.
- I needed someone I could trust and I figured Sally, my nurse, was my best bet.
I decided to try to phone her to see if she was at home.
Maybe they hadn't taken over the pay phones.
I'll try the pay phone.
Hey, Mac.
- Oh, hi, doc, how are you?
- Listen would you get me a couple gallons fast?
I'm in a hurry.
- Sure.
Martha, doc's in a hurry.
Get the windshield, will you?
I have to have the keys to open the gas tank.
- Somebody sick out this way?
- There's been an accident.
- Funny we haven't heard about it.
- Well, it just happened.
- Before I could even get her number
I saw Mac closing the trunk of my car.
He could have been checking my spare tire but I didn't think so.
- That should do it.
- Thank you.
- All set.
- All set, doc.
- Fine, thanks.
Put it on my bill, will you?
- Sure, doc.
What's the matter?
- We've got to make it to Sally's house.
I wasn't sure now there was anyone I could trust, but I took a chance and drove to Sally's anyway.
When I saw several cars in front of the house,
I decided to play it safe.
- What's wrong?
- Probably nothing but we're not going in there until I'm sure it's safe.
Slide over under the wheel and get out of here fast if anybody shows up looking for us.
- The baby asleep yet, Sally?
- Not yet but she will be soon and there'll be no more tears.
- Shall I put this in her room?
- Yes, in her playpen.
No, wait maybe I'd better take it.
- Why don't you go in, Miles?
We've been waiting for you.
- Becky, start the car quick.
Becky, get going.
- Attention, all units attention, all units apprehend and detain
Dr. Miles Bennell and Becky Driscoll now believed heading north in a black and white
Ford sedan license number 2-X-3-7-7-9-6.
All units designated as roadblocks move to your stations.
It is urgent.
These two persons must be detained and not permitted to leave Santa Mira.
Repeat it is urgent.
Be on the lookout for a 1955 black and white Ford sedan license number 2-X-3-7-7-9-6.
- We'll try to make it to my office.
Cut into that alley on the right.
- Do you think he'll come back?
- I don't think they'll check again before morning.
By then Jack should be here with help.
- What if Jack doesn't get through?
- He's gotta get through.
Here now take two of these.
They'll help you to stay awake.
We can't close our eyes all night.
- We may wake up changed into something evil and inhuman.
- In my practice I've seen how people have allowed their humanity to drain away.
Only it happens slowly instead of all at once.
They didn't seem to mind.
- But just some people, Miles.
- All of us a little bit we harden our hearts and grow callous.
Only when we have to fight to stay human do we realize how precious it is to us, how dear as you are to me.
- Maybe that's Jack trying to find us.
- He'd know better than to use the phone.
Where is he?
Why doesn't he come?
Just like any Saturday morning.
Len Pearlman, Bill Bittner
Jim Clark and his wife
Shirley and their kids people I've known all my life.
- What time is it?
Yeah, I know.
It's too early to be so busy.
- What are they doing here?
- There's the answer there must be strangers in town.
They're waiting for the bus to come and go.
There isn't another one through here until 11:00.
Farmers.
Grimaldi, Pixley, Gessner.
- Crescent City.
If you have Crescent City families, step over to truck one.
Crescent City the first truck.
Redbank.
All with Redbank families or contacts go to truck number two.
All with Redbank families or contacts truck number two.
Havenhurst the third truck.
Havenhurst the third truck.
Mill Town the third truck.
Mill Town the third truck.
Valley Springs the third truck.
Valley Springs the third truck.
- First our town then all the towns around us.
It's a malignant disease spreading through the whole country.
- That's all for today.
Be ready again tomorrow.
- I can't wait for Jack any longer stay here.
- But you're not going out there?
- I've got to stop them.
- Wait we're safe here.
- They're not here
I hope we're not too late.
- Jack, thank God.
Jack, the whole town's been taken over by the pods.
- Not quite there's still you and Becky.
- Miles, it would have been so much easier if you'd gone to sleep last night.
- Now relax we're here to help you.
- You know better than that.
- Where do you want us to put them?
- Would you like to watch them grow?
- No, thanks.
- Put them in there.
There's nothing to be afraid of.
We're not going to hurt you.
- Once you understand you'll be grateful.
Remember how Teddy and
I fought against it.
We were wrong.
- You mean Teddy doesn't mind?
- Of course not she feels exactly the way I do.
- Let us go.
- We'll leave town we won't come back.
- We can't let you go.
You're dangerous to us.
- Don't fight it, Miles, it's no use.
Sooner or later you'll have to go to sleep.
- I'll wait for you in the hall.
- Miles, you and I are scientific men.
You can understand the wonder of what's happened.
Now just think.
Less than a month ago Santa Mira was like any other town people with nothing but problems.
Then out of the sky came a solution.
Seeds drifting through space for years took root in a farmer's field.
From the seeds came pods which have the power to reproduce themselves in the exact likeness of any form of life.
- So that's how it began out of the sky.
- Your new bodies are growing in there.
They're taking you over cell for cell atom for atom.
There's no pain.
Suddenly, while you're asleep they'll absorb your minds, your memories and you're reborn into an untroubled world.
- Where everyone's the same?
- Exactly.
- What a world.
We're not the last humans left.
They'll destroy you.
- Tomorrow you won't want them to.
Tomorrow you'll be one of us.
- I love Becky.
Tomorrow, will I feel the same?
- There's no need for love.
- No emotion?
Then you have no feelings only the instinct to survive.
You can't love or be loved am I right?
- You say it as if it were terrible.
Believe me, it isn't.
You've been in love before.
It didn't last.
It never does.
Love, desire, ambition, faith without them life's so simple believe me.
- I don't want any part of it.
- You're forgetting something, Miles.
- What's that?
- You have no choice.
- I guess we haven't any choice.
- Good.
- I want to love and be loved.
I want your children.
I don't want a world without love or grief or beauty.
I'd rather die.
- No.
No.
Not unless there's no other way.
- Why didn't they just give us a shot or a sleeping pill or something?
- Drugs dull the mind maybe that's the reason.
No, it wouldn't work.
I might get one or even two, but I couldn't possibly get three of them.
- You're forgetting something, darling me.
It isn't three against one.
It's three against two give me a knife.
- No.
Here.
Go over by the desk.
- What's going on in there?
- Miles.
- The door is locked.
- Miles, unlock the door.
- Come on, Miles.
Miles, open the door.
- Open the door, Miles.
- Open the door.
- Our only hope is to make it to the highway.
Well, that does it.
The only other way is out the front door and there's bound to be somebody watching.
We'll have to chance it.
Keep your eyes a little wide and blank.
Show no interest or excitement.
Well, Sam, we're finally with you.
- They were supposed to let me know.
The chief said he'd phone the station then I'd get the call.
- He phoned but the line was busy.
He's calling again now.
- Watch out.
I'm sorry, Miles.
- This is Janzek they got away.
Turn the main siren on.
Hey, stairs.
It's only a few steps more.
- Come on they went this way.
They're over there.
- Miles, I can't.
I can't, Miles, I can't.
I can't go on.
- Yes, you can.
- Here's her sweater they must be in the tunnel.
Some of you go that way.
- Give up.
You can't get away from us.
We're not gonna hurt you.
Give up.
- They're not in the tunnel.
All right, everybody, outside.
Come on let's check the hills.
Everybody, move.
- Miles, I can't stay awake much longer.
- I think they're all gone now.
We'd better start or we'll never make it to the highway.
- Miles, I've never heard anything so beautiful.
It means we're not the only ones left to know what love is.
- Stay here and pray they're as human as they sound.
Bye, darling.
- This is station KCAA, the 24-hour platter parade the station of music.
- Becky.
Becky.
Becky.
Becky, where are you?
- I'm here, Miles.
- You didn't go to sleep?
- I'm so tired.
- They weren't people.
It was more of them.
They're growing thousands of pods in greenhouses.
We've got to get away.
- I'm exhausted, Miles, I can't make it.
We can't make it without sleep.
- Yes, we can.
- I went to sleep, Miles, and it happened.
- Oh, Becky.
- They were right.
- I should never have left you.
- Stop acting like a fool,
Miles, and accept us.
- No.
Never.
- He's in here.
He's in here.
Get him.
Get him.
- I've been afraid a lot of times in my life but I didn't know the real meaning of fear until I had kissed Becky.
A moment's sleep and the girl I loved was an inhuman enemy bent on my destruction.
That moment's sleep was death to Becky's soul just as it had been for Jack and Teddy and Dan Kauffman and all the rest.
Their bodies were now hosts harboring an alien form of life, a cosmic form which to survive must take over every human man.
So I ran, I ran.
I ran as little Jimmy Grimaldi had run the other day.
My only hope was to get away from Santa Mira to get to the highway to warn the others of what was happening.
- Wait.
- Go.
Come on we gotta go.
- No, wait let him go.
They'll never believe him.
- Help.
Help.
Help, wait.
Help, help, help wait.
Wait, wait stop.
Stop and listen to me.
Listen to me.
Listen, listen, listen.
More people are coming after me they're not human.
Listen to me we're in danger.
- Get out of the street.
- Danger.
- Go on get out of here.
- You're in danger please.
- Get out of here go on get out of here.
- Get out of the road.
- All of us.
All of us they want all of us.
Now listen, listen, listen to me.
There isn't a human being left in Santa Mira.
Stop pull over.
Please, hey, stop.
Pull over to the side of the road I need your help.
Something terrible has happened.
- Go on you're drunk.
Get out of the street.
Get out of here go on.
- Are you crazy you big idiot?
- Look you fools you're in danger.
Can't you see?
They're after you.
They're after all of us our wives, our children, everyone.
They're here already.
You're next.
You're next.
You're next.
You're next.
You're next.
You don't believe a word of this, do you?
Sure, it's fantastic but it happened.
Don't just sit there measuring me for a straitjacket.
Do something get on the phone and call for help.
What's the use?
- What do you think will psychiatry help?
- If all this is a nightmare, yes.
- Of course it's a nightmare.
Plants from another world taking over human beings mad as a March hare.
What have we here?
- He ran his truck through a red light.
Greyhound bus smacked him broadside and tipped him over.
- Put him in the O.R.
Will you take over Bennell for me, doctor?
- Certainly.
- How badly is he hurt?
- Both legs and left arm broken all to bits.
We had to dig him out from under the most peculiar things I ever saw.
- What things?
- Well, I don't know what they are.
I never saw them before.
They looked like, uh, great big seedpods.
- Seedpods.
- Where was the truck coming from?
- Santa Mira.
- Get on your radio and sound an all-points alarm.
Block all highways and stop all traffic and call every law enforcement agency in the state.
Operator, get me the Federal
Bureau of Investigation.
Yes, it's an emergency.
Prepare to surface.
Depth to 58 feet.
Depth, 58 feet, sir.
Sonar, any contacts topside?
No contact, sir.
- Tank center ready to surface, sir.
- Very well.
Vents shut. Ready to surface, sir.
- Depth, 58 feet, sir.
- Very well.
Up periscope.
Point Lonsdale bearing, mark.
013, sir.
- Cape Schanck bearing, mark.
- 125, sir.
- How's the tide, Bob?
- High tide, sir.
Controls rigged for surfacing, sir.
Surface.
Surface, surface, surface.
- Blow main ballast.
- Main ballast blown.
- Depth 45 feet, sir.
- Secure the air.
Open main induction.
Main induction open, sir.
And our scientists disagree as to when radiation will reach Australia.
The atomic war has ended, but the Prime Minister reports no proof of survival of human life anywhere except here.
Navy department.
Congratulations.
Tea, dear.
I said, "Tea, dear."
Got a bit of a burn yesterday at the beach after all.
You'd better put some calamine stuff on it.
You did give Jennifer her bottle?
I laid out your white uniform.
Was that right?
I almost forgot I have to dash.
Peter?
They must be giving you a ship of your own.
No, darling. They don't give ships to lieutenants.
Then why would it be
Admiral Bridie himself?
If you were just to replace someone who's ill or something, that wouldn't mean seeing
Admiral Bridie, would it?
I don't know. You don't quite know what to expect these days.
I'll pick up Jenny's milk on the way home from the station.
Why do you have to pick it up?
They just won't be delivering it anymore, I understand.
It's a beautiful day, Peter.
If I wheel Jennifer down to the club after lunch, could you meet me there for a swim?
Peter?
They just decided that yesterday.
If you're going to be in Melbourne by 11:00, you'd better hurry.
So long, Charlie.
Hosgood?
- Hosgood!
- Yes, sir?
Have you seen this from that idiot Attenborough?
- That great correlator of statistics.
- Yes, sir.
It's finally seeped down to him that most of the oil in the world comes from the northern hemisphere.
Attenborough says so.
It's now official.
We will carefully conserve the remaining supplies of petrol in the depot.
Yes, sir.
Hosgood!
Lieutenant Holmes is here, sir.
Yes. Come in, come in.
Sit down. Sit down.
Thanks, sir.
I have an assignment for you.
Do you care for some of this miserable muck that passes for coffee these days?
No, thank you, sir.
It's a reasonably important appointment, as things go these days.
That's getting to be quite a phrase, isn't it? "These days."
- You find yourself using it?
- Yes, sir. I'm afraid I do.
I'm sorry it can't be one of our own ships.
It's seagoing though and better than sitting around on your bottom.
Liaison officer aboard the
American submarine, Sawfish.
She just docked.
Nuclear-powered, of course.
- You know about her?
- Yes, sir. I read the report.
She's at our disposal for cruise.
Reconnaissance or whatever you care to call it.
You'll sail soon, but just when or where or for how long, I can't tell you, not until the government and a pack of these longhaired scientists sort themselves out.
She's moored across the dock from the carrier Melbourne in Williamstown.
You'll report to the
Captain Towers.
That will be all, Holmes.
Sir, would it be possible to discuss the duration of this appointment?
No.
But I can give you a review in four months.
Thanks very much, sir, because I'd like to be home if possible when... ls there any official estimate as to how much longer?
The beaker-heads, the finger-in-the-wind boys say, calculating the rate of drift or what have you, about five months before it gets here.
That's why I say four for review.
There's transport leaving for
Williamstown, if you care to take that.
Yes, sir.
Hosgood, where is this coffee coming from?
Supply says it's the best they can do these days, sir.
- Shall I query them again?
- No, no, no. It doesn't matter.
You have anything important to do, Hosgood?
No, sir. What is it?
Nothing. I just thought you might like to take yourself off till Monday, a fine weekend.
Boyfriend or whatever.
No, I... I guess not.
I'll be here, sir.
All watches of seamen fall in on the cargo deck.
Rob.
Lieutenant Holmes will be coming aboard
Monday and off and on until we sail.
Better have Benson issue him what clothing he'll need.
Yes, sir.
- I'll see you Monday, Lieutenant.
- Thanks.
It's funny.
Somehow I get the feeling they're putting her in mothballs.
Sir?
I'm afraid I'll have to bunk you with this scientist fellow who's coming aboard from the C.S.I.R.
Sorry, I don't know who he'll be just yet.
That's all right, sir. I'll manage.
Care for a drink before lunch?
Yes, sir, if it's all right.
It's Australian country in the flattop,
I'll have to stick to Coke.
You have whatever you like.
I'm a bit puzzled about this cruise, sir. Our destination, I mean.
Admiral Bridie seems a bit indefinite.
Of course, if there's some reason I shouldn't know...
No, there's no reason why you shouldn't know.
But outside of the fact that it's reconnaissance,
I don't know any more about it than you do.
Of course, the crew has it all down pat.
We're sailing the end of next week.
We're going north, and we'll be back in two months.
But I'll let you know as soon as
I hear anything more official.
Do you live in Melbourne?
Just outside, actually, in Frankston.
That's three-quarters of an hour by electric train.
You make out all right?
Any serious shortages yet?
Yes, a few, petrol mainly.
But we manage, you know.
Say,
I've been sticking pretty close here lately.
Think I'm due for some shore food.
You know of a place where we might get a good steak?
Yes, I suppose so.
The Admiral fixed me up with a temporary card for something called the
Pastoral Club. What's that like?
It's a mahogany and polished brass sort of place.
Some people used to claim it was the stuffiest club in the Commonwealth.
Of course, I suppose there's no argument about that now.
Would they have any scotch left?
Yes, if anyone does.
My wife's uncle lives there, mostly at the bar these days, I understand.
I would think they would have some scotch, yes.
Sounds good.
Let's give it a try. I'll be with you in five minutes.
Really, sometimes I think that child could float a battleship.
That's what I told the Admiral.
Peter, how could you?
Well, I don't know, really. I just held the towel like this and...
Very funny.
You're starting to get your figure back, aren't you, Charlie?
You know, after Jennifer and all.
A little here, a little there.
By the way, I invited Captain
Towers for the weekend.
- Peter, you didn't.
- I had to, really.
We had lunch together, and he started asking questions about how we live and all.
Mary, I would have looked an awful clod not to have asked him.
- He'll be all right, I think.
- Was he married, do you know?
- Two kids.
- And they're gone?
Yes, they were in America.
Nappies flying in the breeze, pablum everywhere, they're bound to remind him.
We'll just try to get them out of sight, that's all.
He'll get sodden and weep.
I can't stand that again, Peter.
He doesn't look the type to me.
- Your R.A.F. chum didn't either.
- Now, Mary...
What are we going to do with him for two whole days?
Well, for one thing, I thought a party on Saturday night.
Ten or 12 people. We haven't done that for a while.
Would you like that?
As long as they all understand how I feel about those morbid discussions.
We would have to get someone for him, though, wouldn't we?
What about Moira?
Why not? If she's sober this weekend.
Julian said she'd given it up.
No, darling, you didn't listen. Julian said she'd given up gin for brandy.
She says she can drink more brandy.
Moira's not a bad notion, in point of fact.
She'd keep him occupied, at least.
But she'd have to stop over, and we can't just put him on a cot.
Put Moira on a cot on the veranda.
She claims she's not slept in her own bed the last three months anyway.
That's not entirely fair.
It's all on the surface.
I'll ring her up tonight and give her the drill.
I wonder what he's like when he gets a skinful.
- Peter.
- What?
You do understand how I feel,
I mean, about people talking?
Sure.
- And you do love me?
- Of course I do.
Then why don't you ever say so?
Give her what for, mate.
You're looking for me.
Am I?
I'm Moira Davidson. M-O-I-R-A.
It was a very fashionable name in bad novels when my mother was young and impressionable.
I'm a throwback.
Where's Holmes?
He's decking the halls with holly.
He sent me for better or worse.
Better, I'd say.
I'm your date or whatever you call it.
How'd you recognize me?
I love Americans. They're so naive.
This way, Commander.
A new model.
Only one horsepower, but she does a good eight miles an hour on the flat.
- Quite a buggy.
- Over 70 years old.
Dad said she was made in America.
- I wouldn't be surprised.
- Give me your toothbrush.
Take Amelia's head while I see if we can get us out of here.
She's still a wee bit sticky in reverse.
All right, boy. Here we go.
Is there a place we might stop where
I could get a little breakfast?
- What?
- A little breakfast.
Do you mean that in addition to everything else,
I have to watch you eat bacon and eggs and all that muck?
I was on a party last night, and I got up at 8:00 in the morning to meet you.
- Well, I...
- Never mind. Hop in.
But you have to buy me a couple drinks to get me started.
Incidentally, they didn't tell me what to call you.
What's the protocol?
My name is Towers,
Dwight Lionel Towers.
- Really?
- Really.
Well, hang on, Dwight Lionel.
As a matter of fact, we've only been in port for three days.
It's called the Sawfish.
My second husband was an American.
We traveled all over the world, and everywhere we went, he would say to people,
"I am an American.
I am an American."
They finally shot him in one of those eastern countries.
I'm sorry.
I was too. He was such a nice man while he lasted.
Is he yours, Moira?
On loan.
He just drinks and drinks and nothing happens.
- At least he hasn't burst into tears.
- Keep up the good work.
That's sheer balderdash!
I never heard so much nonsense in my life.
You mean to tell me this whole damn war was an accident?
No, it wasn't an accident.
I didn't say that.
It was carefully planned, down to the tiniest mechanical and emotional detail.
But it was a mistake, it was a beaut.
In the end, somehow granted the time for examination, we shall find that our so-called civilization was gloriously destroyed by a handful of vacuum tubes and transistors.
Probably faulty.
There you are, Julian.
There you are.
Now we know where the blame lies. Don't we?
No, you don't. No. No. No.
Maybe we were the blind mechanics of disaster, but you don't pin the guilt on the scientists that easily.
You might as well pin it on motherhood.
Well, it should be pinned on somebody.
And you scientists are the likely ones, as far as I can see.
You built the bomb.
You experimented with it, tested it and exploded it.
- Now, just a moment, Morgan.
- Thanks to you chaps, a moment is about all we have.
Every man who ever worked on this thing told you what would happen.
The scientists signed petition
- after petition.
- Julian, please.
But nobody listened.
There was a choice. It was build the bombs and use them, or risk the United States, the Soviet Union, and the rest of us would find some way to go on living.
That's wishful thinking, if ever I heard it.
I'm not against wishful thinking, not now.
Look, they pushed us too far.
They didn't think we'd fight, no matter what they did.
And they were wrong. We fought.
We expunged them!
We didn't do such a bad job on ourselves.
With the interesting result that the background level of radiation in this very room is nine times what it was a year ago.
- Julian.
- Don't you know that?
Nine times! We're all doomed, you know.
The whole silly, drunken, pathetic lot of us.
Doomed by the air we're about to breathe. We haven't got a chance!
Stop it! I won't have it, Julian!
I won't.
There is hope.
There has to be hope.
There's always hope.
We just can't go on like this.
We can't.
We... We...
I shouldn't drink, you know.
I inevitably say something brilliant.
Sorry.
I can't help it, Peter.
I'm sorry.
I just can't.
Everybody's gone to bed.
You like that?
Settles the stomach.
I had a lot to drink.
I had a lot to drink.
Julian had a lot to drink.
Julian and I are the town drunks.
What are you trying to forget?
Well, it's a damn silly question if I ever heard one.
Yeah, you're right.
It's just an expression.
You know, somebody should have given me a copy of the local ground rules.
I might have opened my big mouth.
Danger struck from the wrong quarter.
The people of the city watch the wrong mousehole.
Come again?
But then, who would know you were so tough and drank straight milk?
Where are you from? Which state?
- I'm from Idaho.
- Idaho?
I know better than that.
There's no navy in Idaho because it's too hilly.
I was born in Idaho.
I live in Connecticut now.
Near New London, where I'm based.
Where were you during all the whatchamacallit?
No.
I didn't mean to ask you that. Peter said not to.
You don't have to answer.
I can't decide if I'm more objectionable drunk or sober.
It's perfectly all right.
We were at sea between Kiska and
Midway when it began.
We got orders to go to the West Pacific, and when we put our nose up north of Iwo Jima, the air was filled with radioactive dust.
So we ducked.
Later on, took a look at Manila through the periscope.
It was still too hot to surface, so we came down the coast of Australia and ended up here.
There wasn't much of anyplace else to go.
- You look married.
- I am.
My wife's name is Sharon.
I have a couple of kids.
Richard, eight. Helen, five.
Dick is the real sailor of the family.
He is going to go to Annapolis.
That's to be expected.
He'll probably change his mind.
Why is it taking so long?
Can you explain it to me?
Nobody can explain it to me.
And don't tell me about those damn winds again.
How the northern hemisphere and the southern hemisphere get all mixed up and overlap.
I don't want to hear about that anymore.
All I want to know is... if everybody was so smart, why didn't they know what would happen?
They did.
Well, I... I can't take it.
I...
Yes, I can take it.
But it's unfair.
It's unfair because
I didn't do anything.
And nobody I know did anything.
Maybe I'm stupid.
I had to take algebra twice.
The only thing I could understand was geography.
I like geography.
You know what I always wanted to do?
I wanted to walk down the Rue de Rivoli.
Have you ever been to the Rue de Rivoli?
Yes.
I wanted to walk down the Rue de Rivoli, and I wanted to buy gloves.
I know the French word for gloves...
No, you've got it all backwards.
What's that?
I was supposed to comfort you, and you're comforting me.
I'm crying.
Everybody was so afraid that you might cry.
- They were?
- Isn't that funny?
No.
Sometimes I do.
You better go to bed.
But you're in my bedroom.
I'll clear out.
Dwight.
Even if you don't like me, would you please hold onto me just for a moment longer?
This fellow Julian...
I take it that he's English and here on some kind of scientific job.
What does he do, exactly?
I think Professor Jorgensen should outline his plan before we make a decision.
Simply stated, our view, our strong opinion, is this, that during the last winter in the northern hemisphere, rain and snow may have washed the air, so to speak, causing the radioactive elements to fall to the ground more quickly than anticipated.
But the transfer of radioactivity to us would be progressively decreased, and human life could go on here or, at least in Antarctica...
That's clear enough,
Professor Jorgensen.
It's a hope.
We agree and the government agrees that it's worth trying to find out, anyhow.
How far north could a vessel proceed?
Our recommendation is that the submarine should go as far north in the
Pacific as possible, to Point Barrow, and make the necessary radioactivity readings.
The Prime Minister's instruction, incidentally, is the Sawfish be exposed to as few dangers as possible.
Commander, how about ice that far north?
She's no icebreaker.
We can feel our way.
I make it over 13,000 miles round trip.
Enough power in your reactor for that, Commander?
I understand there's a considerable stockpile of uranium here.
Enough for 10 trips like this.
Wish we had something we could use it in.
You might try using it in my car.
Get a load of the Charlie Wheeler.
- May I be of assistance?
- Yes, I'm looking for Captain Towers.
I'll try to locate him for you.
Paulson, show the lady to Captain
Towers' cabin on the Melbourne.
- Thank you very much.
- It's a pleasure.
Right this way, please.
Relax.
Captain.
There's somebody to see you.
I asked her to wait in your stateroom.
Hello.
A very nice man asked me to wait here.
I don't think he knew what to do with me.
That's debatable.
Did you ask me to visit your submarine one day?
- No.
- I couldn't remember.
In the meantime,
I've been snooping.
Regular fish, these kids.
I'll have to get them a boat of their own one of these days.
- Sit down.
- Thank you.
Here, have a cigarette.
Thank you.
I'm glad you came.
I just bet you are.
No, I am. Really.
And I'll just bet that my crew didn't mind too much either.
Yes, I have a sneaking suspicion they didn't mind at all.
Come in.
- I see they found you.
- Mr. Chrysler.
See if you can find Ms. Davidson something she can wear to go down in the
Sawfish, will you?
Yes, sir.
I take it you put me to bed.
Yes.
I arrived at that by deduction.
I asked Peter and Mary, and they didn't.
I'm afraid I was a bit of a mess.
You drank too much brandy.
You passed out.
Yes, I've been drinking quite a bit recently. That's no big secret.
But, you know, I...
I've never had it happen quite like that before.
My obvious job was to seduce you.
So I suppose my pride is hurt.
I ought to feel ashamed.
Why did you bother about me?
There's a regulation in here somewhere.
It's under "Shore duty."
- I'll read it to you.
- No, tell me.
It says when a young lady has had so much to drink, that she doesn't know what she's doing, you put her to bed and go back to the ship.
- That's what it says?
- That's what it says.
Yes?
This requires quite a comprehensive change. Are you sure about this?
You can't go down in a submarine in that ballet costume.
I'll give you five minutes.
Unpack that one next, please. That one.
- Everything under control, Mr. Osborn?
- I guess so.
Blasted idiots sent me two wrong components.
I'll have to get them replaced this afternoon.
As long as they're right when we sail.
What on earth is he doing here?
Mr. Osborn's been assigned by the C.S.I.R. to look after our health on the trip.
Health?
It's your submarine.
Captain, may I see you a minute, sir?
Half a second.
Very becoming outfit.
You know, Julian, they don't allow drinking on American submarines.
I can't imagine what else you'd do.
Thanks very much.
What are you going to do?
Keep an eye on the weather.
Check on radiation.
I guess I'm sort of a scientific cruise director.
Then it can be dangerous?
I wouldn't know, really.
A relative question at best, isn't it?
It seems that everybody
I know is going.
I feel left out.
I can sing and dance.
You'll have to excuse me.
The Admiral is up top.
Don't you go away.
It's the damnedest thing. Started the day before yesterday.
Came on again 10 minutes ago, sir.
Starts and stops. We've monitored 60 hours so far.
It's weird. You're sure it's from San Diego?
Within a 100-mile radius, sir.
It's as close as we're able to pinpoint it without triangulation.
Could it be a kid, somebody who doesn't know Morse?
We've made two words up to now, sir. "Water" and "connect."
You know the old story about an infinite number of monkeys and an infinite number of typewriters.
One of them has to end up by writing King Lear.
I may be cracking up under the strain, like everybody else, but this interests me.
It's more than Jorgensen's theory. It's a fact.
It's impossible, but it's a fact.
A radio signal is coming from around
San Diego, and they shouldn't be.
There shouldn't even be any power for transmission.
- Hydroelectric?
- Yes, possibly.
There has to be an explanation for it, and I'd like to know what it is.
Not that I'll live any longer for knowing.
How would you like to track it down?
- I'd like it, sir.
- Very well, then.
I've been onto our electronic wizards.
They tell us you have radio direction equipment that can be used from periscope depth.
- Is that correct?
- Yes. It hasn't been used much.
But I have to run some tests.
I'd like it to be in the pink.
Perhaps you can amuse yourself around here a little longer, until you're ready to leave.
What did you do that for?
We could have won.
They've had it.
Are they all right?
They're all right, but they're out of the race.
It's like looking at a French movie.
Dr. Fletcher?
What about these pills they've got, whatever they are?
They'll be available from the chemists' shops on the free list, when the time comes.
I understand that they have got them already at Port Moresby and Darwin.
Apparently.
What's the effect?
Lethargy, then some euphoria, coma, then nothing.
In fairly rapid order.
You...
You don't suppose you could get me a couple?
And... Whatever it is for children?
Not a chance.
Until the time comes.
Sorry, Peter.
I'm beginning to twitch when
I hear the word "time."
If for some reason I'm not talking about now, I'm just talking... if there's one thing you could do...
No. No, I know what I mean.
When the dentist is drilling your tooth, what do you think about?
The nicest thing? Sex? Or what?
Fishing.
Trout fishing in a clean mountain stream.
You would.
Why not go then when you come back?
The season doesn't open until September. I've asked.
You think I can't fix that?
You think I don't know important people, that I spend all my time with this moldy suburban set?
You can't mean me. She never bottled like that before. What happened?
She bottled us.
I was trying to win.
Taking the race too seriously, not paying enough attention to her.
Truth is, he made a pass at me.
I had to go overboard in self-defense.
Well, if that...
I do so much like to see the young folks enjoying themselves.
What?
You never wrestle with me anymore.
What does that mean?
I mean exactly what I say. You never wrestle with me anymore.
- All right.
- Peter, really.
- Well, I thought you said I never wrestle.
- Never mind... For now.
- Now, tell them the truth.
- But I told them the truth.
Sharon is the most terrible liar that...
I think it's absolutely preposterous.
How much of this Gould Campbell have we got left, Stevens?
Better than 400 bottles, sir.
And in its prime.
Shocking. Shocking!
Four hundred bottles of vintage port in the cellars and barely five months to go.
Five months, mark you! If what these scientist chaps say is right.
I think it needs another year, actually.
I blame the wine committee very much. Very much, indeed.
Should have had more foresight.
How can the members be expected to get through 400 bottles of port in five months' time?
Bad planning, I say.
Ridiculous.
I'll take another bottle home with me today, Stevens.
Yes, sir.
Sir Douglas Froude is expecting me.
- I believe he's in the bar, sir.
- Thank you.
Yes, I've heard about those pills.
This cruise is developing into something bigger than I thought.
I may not be here when it happens.
I understand, but if Dr. Fletcher can't get them for you,
I'm not certain I can.
I've tried everything else.
You're my last hope.
You're convinced you want
Mary to have them now?
I've thought about it a great deal.
Yes, sir. Yes, I do.
I'm not certain you're right.
But considering Mary...
I don't know how much weight I carry with the government in my old age.
There's a lot of bureaucracy still, you know? Even in death.
But take this around anyway and see what happens.
Thank you.
The wine committee is mad, absolutely mad.
Four hundred bottles of vintage port.
Too late. Too late.
Sorry, Dykers. Good show. Carry on.
As a matter of fact, the whole thing is due to the wine committee having failed to conserve their supplies properly.
If they'd only regulated their...
How nice.
Have you noticed Moira isn't drinking nearly so much? I wonder why.
No, I hadn't noticed.
Peter?
Could we afford an electric mower for the lawn?
A very little one I could start myself while you're away?
Doris Haymes has one.
She does.
She's cut the cord three times and nearly electrocuted herself.
Besides, darling,
I doubt there's any left.
What's that?
Sit down, sit down.
This is something I want you to know about before I go.
You're going to be serious?
I wish you wouldn't.
I wish I didn't have to be.
Now, darling, this is a big cruise we're going on.
There will be mines and ice to contend with.
Peter, I knew when I married you that you were going to be a naval officer.
My father died at sea.
You know that.
We just don't have to discuss it, do we?
We have to discuss this, Mary, because there isn't any tradition for this.
Peter...
And you're going to listen whether you like it or not.
Now, this is a special kind of sleeping pill.
I had a devil of a time getting them, but I wanted you to have them on hand.
And make sure you knew how to use them.
What happens with the radiation is that you get ill.
You start feeling sick, and then you are sick.
And you go on being sick.
You can't keep anything down.
You may feel better for a while, but it always comes back.
You get weaker.
And this cures it?
Darling, you know nothing cures it.
This ends it.
But, Peter...
However ill I was,
I couldn't do that.
Who'd look after Jennifer?
Jenny will get it, too.
You're not trying to tell me you want me to kill Jennifer?
Mary, don't be an idiot!
Supposing you get it first, what are you going to do? Struggle by yourself until you drop?
Jenny might live for days and be helpless in her crib with you dead on the floor!
Don't you see that?
Don't you see it?
Darling, I'm sorry.
I can't believe it myself half the time.
Let's not discuss it anymore right now, Peter.
Anyway, Mrs. Hildreth's husband was talking to someone the other day, who said it isn't coming here after all.
- He says it's slowing...
- For God's sake, Hildreth's a damn fool!
Let's go.
Would you like another drink?
No, let's go for a walk.
All right.
You know, I think I've discovered why you fascinate me.
Shall I tell you?
Because you take me for granted.
I know women aren't supposed to like that sort of thing, but somehow I do.
I've been treated in every other way.
Like a child...
And sometimes like...
Well, like things I've probably deserved.
But I've never been pushed around in such a nice way and treated something like a wife.
I suppose what I mean is, like an American wife.
- Moira, this isn't going to do us any...
- No, hear me out.
I was hurt at first when I realized you were mixing me up with Sharon.
And then I realized that, that it was one of the nicest things that could happen to me.
I wouldn't really mind if you could forget entirely who I am.
I don't like myself very much anyway.
Wouldn't you like to try?
No.
It seemed like a good idea.
I suppose it wasn't.
There's a train leaving at 10:50.
I think I'll take it.
You see, in the navy, during the war,
I got used to the idea that something might happen to me,
I might not make it.
I also got used to the idea of my wife and children safe at home.
They'd be all right, no matter what.
What I didn't reckon with was that in this...
This kind of a monstrous war, something might happen to them and not to me.
Well, it did.
And I can't...
I can't cope with it.
My kids...
All the planning since the day they were born.
Sharon...
Sharon and I, we...
Well...
See, we were the sort of people who...
We would have been happy to grow old together.
I can't accept it. I can't...
Does that make any sense?
Do you understand?
Yes.
It makes sense.
I understand.
Good night.
I am sorry to see this.
And you were doing so much better, too.
I would like to come in, whatever this is.
An opium den, more than likely.
How on earth did you find me?
What is it?
It's a Ferrari.
- Does it run?
- "Does it run?"
She won the Grand Prix last year.
Bought it from Simonelli's widow.
Gave her 100 quid for it.
What are you going to do with it?
Race it, of course.
You?
Me. You needn't sound so pessimistic.
I've always wanted to, just never could afford it.
Sixth of August, if the
Commander gets me back in time.
You're going to kill yourself.
It's possible.
Julian?
When was it you were in love with me and I...
And you were so stupid about it?
And I was so stupid about it.
You should have grabbed me, you know. I'm about to be extinct.
I came here tonight, Julian, because I want to know.
Are you still...
I'm serious.
In a normal world, I think I would still be in love with you.
Yes or no, Julian?
But lately, with so little time left, my sense of values seem to have changed.
No, then?
I'm such a fake, such a lot of meaningless talk.
- Now, now, don't say that.
- Yes, it's true.
There have been men, lots of men.
And every time one fell out, there was always a replacement.
But not one of them meant anything to me.
I can't pretend any longer, Julian.
I'm afraid.
I have nobody, and I'm afraid.
What about Dwight?
He's married.
He's married to a girl named Sharon.
- And they have two children.
- I know.
But if things were different, if she were alive, I'd do anything.
Any mean trick I know to get him.
Even if I could make him forget, there isn't time.
No time to love and nothing to remember.
Nothing worth remembering.
I can't go home tonight, Julian.
May I stay here with you?
It's late, and I have to pick up some things before we leave.
Leave? You're leaving?
At 6:00 this morning.
He didn't tell you.
Come on.
I'll take you home.
Got 56 feet, sir.
I recommend course 045, Captain.
Right rudder, new course, 045.
- Right rudder, new course, 045, sir.
- Check sonar.
Fogarty, how's it look topside?
All clear for about a mile, scattered icebergs.
This looks like the spot.
- All stop.
- All stop!
Up periscope.
Okay. I got Point Barrow.
Bearing, 130 relative.
Distance.
- About seven miles.
- Aye, aye, sir.
All right, Mr. Osborn. You can take your readings now.
- Chief, raise the E.C.M.
- Aye, aye, sir.
E.C.M. fully extended, sir.
It's hot, isn't it?
It's hotter than it is in mid-Pacific, at least 30 points in the red.
That takes care of
Jorgensen's theory.
Well, we've got another job to do.
Let's get the hell out of here.
What's the course, Bob?
225, sir.
Down periscope and E.C.M.
Course 225. All ahead, standard.
Take her to 100 feet.
- Course 225. All ahead, standard.
- Just like that?
Take her to 100 feet, sir.
Fogarty, will you get us out of this deep freeze?
When we're clear of Bering Strait, set a course for San Francisco.
Aye, aye, sir.
Julian?
You ever been to San Francisco?
Yes, I have.
A week on the way down, met a lovely girl.
Longest, loveliest legs I've ever seen.
Full of martinis, both of them.
The legs, I mean.
It got to you, didn't it?
You know...
I've been trying to get Mary to face up to it.
To make her understand what has to be done when the time comes.
But she won't.
She just won't.
And I don't know what I'm gonna do.
I don't think you'll have to worry about Mary.
You don't know, Julian.
You just don't know.
You didn't see her face when I told her...
She'd have to give Jennifer one of those pills if it happened before I got back.
You'd have thought I was a murderer or something.
All I was doing was what
I felt I had to do.
How do you tell a woman you love that she has to kill herself and her baby?
How do you do it?
I envy you.
You envy me, do you?
You have someone to worry about.
I never envied anyone before.
Never really believed in it.
But you, yes, I do. I envy you.
You have a wife and a child, nappies to change.
You have a lot to remember.
You're fortunate to have someone to worry about.
There are those who don't, you know?
I mean, have anyone to worry about.
Moira, for one.
Myself, for another.
We let it all go by the boards. It's too late now.
But you, you've had it all.
And I'll thank you not to bother me with any more of your blubbering.
I don't know why I like you so much,
Peter. You can be such an intolerable ass.
Julian?
Julian?
Now what the devil?
Thanks.
What are you standing there looking so silly for?
I don't know. I just don't know.
You're not losing your mind or something, are you?
No, I don't think so.
You know, if I can just get back in time, I don't think I'll complain about a thing.
I think I could change Jennifer 24 hours a day and never complain.
Alcatraz Island on port beam, sir. Range, 800 yards.
Suggest we come right
10 degrees, sir.
- Right 10 degrees.
- Right 10 degrees, sir.
New course, 160.
- All stop.
- All stop.
Up both periscopes.
Captain, San Francisco is yeoman Swain's hometown.
He wants to take a look.
Okay, let him look.
- Still doesn't make any sense.
- Down San Diego way, all right.
It's got to be hydroelectric.
Where could it be?
Probably in one of the refineries along the coast.
They've got the transmitters and lots of juice.
See your house, Rob?
No, sir.
You couldn't see it from here anyway.
It's up in the hills.
Seen enough?
Yes, sir. Thank you.
You know,
I seem to keep expecting to see more damage.
There's no people.
I wonder where they are.
Dogs go somewhere to die.
They don't want anybody to look at them.
Maybe people do the same thing, go to bed.
Captain!
Swain's out through the escape trunk, sir.
Out?
Secure the loading hatch.
Drain the escape trunk.
Why didn't somebody stop him?
Raise the boat!
Give me that.
Swain, this is the
Captain. Hear this.
Don't be a damn fool, Swain!
Come back right now, and we'll take you aboard.
But I mean right now!
Swain, do you hear me?
Swain!
I got a date on Market Street,
Captain. I'm going home!
Mr. Osborn.
How long can he last out there?
Three or four days, a week.
Depends on the individual.
We'd be safe to take him back up till when?
Up to not more than a few hours.
Certainly not after he's eaten or drunk something ashore.
Then you might as well take a time bomb aboard.
It'll be dark in about an hour.
We'll set on the bottom for the night.
Secure the diving stations.
Underway at 7:30.
- Good morning, Swain.
- Hi, Captain.
I thought you'd gone.
- Catch anything?
- No, just started.
Always do though, out here.
How are you feeling?
Okay.
My stomach was upset last night, but I got some Alka-Seltzer from the drugstore.
I must have swallowed some saltwater.
What's it like in town?
Everybody's dead, I guess.
My folks are.
I didn't look much after I saw a few.
I got a case of good beer, if you want any.
No, thanks.
Captain, how long is it before I feel anything?
A few days, a week.
There's no rule.
Well, the weather's okay, if the wind would die down a little.
Captain, I didn't mean any disrespect or anything yesterday.
I want you to understand that, but...
I'd rather be home here to have it than in Australia.
You know what I mean?
I know what you mean.
Is there anything you want before we go?
I'm okay.
We won't be coming back.
I know.
You'll get pretty sick.
Have you got anything to take?
I got 200 drugstores to choose from.
Good luck.
Okay. Take it easy.
Watch the suck of the props now.
- No soap, sir?
- Gibberish.
Can't make out a thing. I don't know what the hell it is.
Stay with it. Got to be somebody.
You know, one of us was the last man to see San Francisco, the last man alive next to Swain, that is, and we didn't see much.
Somebody ought to write a history of the war.
What are you bucking for, a whole chapter to yourself?
I doubt anyone could put it all together.
Well, if they do,
I'd like to read it.
I was in it for a while, and I didn't know anything about it.
I don't even know who started it.
I wish somebody had stopped it.
You know, the people on Mars probably saw what happened.
When things cool off, they'll probably come down and take over.
How about that,
Professor? Any chance?
They might have the means of paying our corpse a visit, but I shouldn't advise it for a long time.
Who do you think started it, the war?
- Albert Einstein.
- You're kidding.
Do you really want to know who I think started the war?
- Yeah.
- Why?
You're an egghead, aren't you?
Who would ever have believed that human beings would be stupid enough to blow themselves off the face of the earth?
I don't believe it even now.
We didn't want a war.
We didn't start it.
How did it start?
The trouble with you is you want a simple answer, and there isn't any.
The war started when people accepted the idiotic principle that peace could be maintained by arranging to defend themselves with weapons they couldn't possibly use without committing suicide.
Everybody had an atomic bomb and counter-bombs and counter-counter bombs.
The devices outgrew us.
We couldn't control them.
I know.
I helped build them. God help me.
Somewhere some poor bloke probably looked at a radar screen and thought he saw something.
He knew that if he hesitated one thousandth of a second, his own country would be wiped off the map, so he pushed a button.
And...
The world went crazy.
And...
And...
What's with him?
Maybe we shouldn't ask him any more questions.
What's new from San
Diego, Sundstrom?
Still can't make it out, sir.
We'll be there soon enough.
Lungren.
Sir?
Mr. Osborn is doing a good job for us.
He's not used to this kind of duty.
He's not feeling well, just a little claustrophobia.
- Beg your pardon, sir?
- Professor needs a drink.
He's a civilian. He's used to a shot or two before dinner.
See what you can find in the medical locker.
The closer you can come to scotch, the better.
Yes, sir.
Pull it tighter!
Now I want you back here in one hour.
Ditch the boat, the suit, the tank, everything.
And take a shower in the trunk for 10 minutes.
And no souvenirs.
All I want to see come through that hatch is you.
As naked as a baby, understand?
We'll give you a blast every quarter hour.
When you hear the third quarter, get!
I don't care if you find a tribe of beautiful girls, eager!
Get! And I mean it.
Fan your tail for home.
He's away.
Check Jones.
Sundstrom's away.
Still getting that signal?
Off and on. They never went to radio school, those spooks, that's for sure.
Amazing equipment to last like that.
Wind. Window shade tugging on a Coke bottle.
Say, what time is it in Melbourne?
1500, sir.
I hope old Bridie's listening.
She's beautiful, isn't she?
So full of life.
- Here you are, baby.
- And she always waits for the sugar.
She knows she won't get it if she doesn't.
Go on, get out. Get.
I'll bet she would.
I'll bet if she sat down and refused to do anything, she'd still get the sugar.
He should be coming home any day now.
- I'm not sure.
- Have you missed him?
Terribly.
Then why don't you tell him?
Dwight?
What a thing to do to me.
I'd given you up.
I thought the polar bears had you.
Don't you ever do that to me again, leave me without telling me.
I don't think I will.
You're thinner. You're not ill?
No, no, a little tired.
I'm all right.
You're sure about that?
I'm positive, Ms. Davidson,
I'm absolutely positive.
Why didn't you telephone, let me come and meet you at the station?
I thought I'd walk.
I wanted the air.
Is your invitation to spread a little fertilizer still open?
Can you stay for a few days?
If you've got room for me.
I'd build a house if I didn't.
Peter... Peter, I...
Darling, I'll never leave you again.
You might as well run a railway train through here.
I beg your pardon?
There's no need to frighten all the animals.
Sorry, sorry.
Julian.
Hello, hello.
The Admiral told me
I'd find you here.
I thought you might want to have a look at this report of mine before I have it typed.
I'm sure it'll be all right.
Well, you don't have to be so noisy about it.
The cows won't give any milk for a week.
He just said that.
So this is the Ferrari?
What will she do?
I don't really know yet, but
I'll find out on Saturday.
You are coming to the race, aren't you?
Well, I'd like to.
Will there be much of a crowd?
I shouldn't think so.
It's a question of transport for most people.
Besides, nobody cares who wins.
I suppose you think you're going to?
I might. It's the fastest car, you know.
Commander, there's a telephone call for you.
All right. Be right back.
Julian, this is ridiculous.
Why are you doing it?
Because I want to.
I can't think of a better reason.
You think it's that funny?
In view of things, don't you?
"From United States
Naval Forces, Brisbane.
"To Commander D.L. Towers,
USN, USS Sawfish.
"One, on the retirement of the present commander US Naval Forces at this date,
"you will immediately and henceforth assume the duty of
"Commander US Naval
Forces in all areas."
I guess this makes you an admiral, if you want to be one.
Congratulations.
Thank you, sir.
May I dictate something to your secretary?
Yes, I could let you dictate something to her, but I tried to get through to
Brisbane myself half an hour ago.
There was no reply.
They've closed up.
I see.
Thank you, sir.
He's moving up.
I wish he'd be more careful.
It's not that important.
It is to him.
He almost had it that time.
I can't watch much more of this. Is Julian all right?
He's all right. He's back on the track.
Julian!
He doesn't make the slightest bit of sense.
He's never been in a race before.
Well, he won it, didn't he?
I had lunch with Admiral
Bridie yesterday.
He told me that somebody brought pressure to bear and got the trout season moved up.
It opens tomorrow.
Why don't we have a crack at it, go up to the mountains for a few days?
When?
Now.
I know just the spot.
It's nice, quiet and peaceful.

Captain.
You'd better have a look at Ackerman.
Ackerman? What's wrong with him?
The doctor says he's in a bad way.
You'd better have a look at him.
I'll go right down.
Do that again, baby, will ya?
- Hello, Ackerman.
- Hello, Captain.
How are you feeling?
I'm okay, except I'm a little weak.
Can't seem to keep anything in my stomach yet.
Guess I hoisted a few too many beers the other night.
You know, I don't know what the kangaroos are putting in the brew nowadays, but I can sure tell you what it tastes like.
- You just take it easy.
- Yeah.
You'll be perfectly okay.
- Dr. King here will look after you.
- I'll do fine.
Any chance that he's right?
He just had a few too many?
No, he has the full range of symptoms.
It's radiation.
Why...
Why this one case all of a sudden?
Why? Why not? It's here.
It had to hit somebody first. It hit this lad.
We're not machines. We're not going to fall over in rows, you know.
- Anything you can do for him?
- No.
Except make him as comfortable as possible.
This thing is coming sooner than we thought.
I'm a little off balance.
I'm terribly sorry if it's inconvenient, but I'm afraid I can't be held responsible for that.
I never predicted the precise date.
No, I don't think we have a freak case here, Commander.
I've been getting very irritable myself, as you can see.
It's one of the first symptoms.
O lord, give us the strength.
Help us to understand the reason for this madness on earth, the reason why we have destroyed ourselves.
Give us the courage to bear thy will, and when the end is upon us, give us thy hand and show us the way.
That we may better understand that only you can give, and only you can take away.
Forgive those of us who are weak, as we forgive each other.
For Jesus' sake. Amen.
Simpson, John.
Jones, Norman, Molly,
Kenneth and Kim.
Dickson, George and Lola.
You all know the situation.
I've given leave to many of you, to stay here for personal reasons.
It's understandable why some of you might prefer this.
I think that the rest of you are entitled to decide what you'd like to do.
I'd like you to think about it.
Take a vote if you need to.
Give me your decision by this evening.
I think that's all.
Captain.
We've already taken a vote.
We'd like to head for home.
Just give it to me straight.
How much longer?
We're 15 points in the red.
Up three and a half since last night.
I suppose you've heard about Mary.
No. What?
Quite irrational.
Peter came in Sunday to find her packing for a trip back to England, taking Jennifer.
I'm sorry to hear that.
She's a bit calmer now, doctor and all that.
Dwight?
Yes?
What about Moira?
I want to stay with her right to the end, but I had to leave it to the men.
We're going.
When do you leave?
In a day, two at the most.
You might not have that much time.
Yes, I know.
I've got to see her right away.
So long, Julian.
God bless.
Hosgood?
Hosgood?
Yes, sir?
It looks as if we've had it, Hosgood.
Would you like shore leave or are you staying aboard?
I'm remaining aboard, sir.
Would you have a glass of sherry with an old man?
No, sir, but I would very much like to have one with you, sir.
There's one thing that always bothered me, Hosgood.
A girl like you...
Why no young men?
They never asked me.
I guess maybe it was the uniform.
To a blind...
Blind world.
I think I can get Mrs. Andrews to help me out with Jennifer.
Yes, but if you need anything, you'd better call me.
I'm sure she'll be all right, but I wish there was something I could do for Mary.
Mary, Mary.
Moira, it's for you.
Hello. Dwight.
Yes, I'll be there!
Right away, Dwight!
I'll be there!
Moira!
You're not going.
- You're staying. You're staying.
- No.
I'm going.
- But the Sawfish...
- Just across the bay at the fuel depot.
The men want to try to get home.
I can't explain it.
Then I suppose that the time has come to say,
"it's been nice, Dwight Lionel.
"It's been everything."
Dwight, I'm so frightened.
I know.
I'm so sorry for so many things.
I love you, Moira.
I love you.
I love you.
Mary.
Mary.
I love you.
Did you say something, Peter?
I didn't hear.
I said, "I love you."
I... I feel so strange.
You remember the first time we ever met?
It was on the beach.
I thought you were everything
I'd ever dreamed about, everything I ever wanted.
I thought you were so underfed.
Every day after that,
I went to the beach, but you were never there.
I had the flu. My mother made me stay at home.
I looked for you.
I looked for you so.
Did you suffer horribly?
Mary, you'll never know.
Did you really?
I thought I couldn't bear it if I didn't see you again.
I'd about given up hope, but one day, there you were.
Now it's all over, isn't it?
It's all over.
And I want you to know that I could never have been happy with anyone in the world but you.
I've loved you, Peter.
I've been foolish, and I haven't been practical, but I've loved you so much.
So much.
We've been happy and fortunate.
And Jennifer...
She'll never have the chance.
She'll never know what love is.
- Peter, Peter, you'll see that she's...
- I will, I will.
Darling.
God!
God forgive us.
Peter,
I think I'll have that cup of tea now.
The Crawling Eye (1958) aka The Trollenberg Terror.
What's he doing up there?
- Hey! Jimmy!
- Hang on a minute.
Can't see.
It's foggy.
Gone cold too.
What do you say?!
I tell you it's foggy!
Cloud, or something...
Hey! Wait a minute.
There's someone coming.
Who is it, Jim, the
Abominable Snowman?
I tell you, there's someone coming.
I can't see a thing.
Who is it? Who is it?
No... no...!
Nooo...!
Gerald!
- Help.
- Right.
Take the strands.
Haul it quick.
Stand by. Now pick it up.
- Heave.
- Hold.
Heave!
Can you see him?
Not yet. He's just below the lip.
Here he is. Jim?
No!
Come on! Come on!
You idiot, we nearly had him.
Why did you let him go?
Didn't you see it?
What are you taking about?
His head...
It was torn off!
Hey...? Anne?
- Huh?
- Were you dreaming?
No, I don't think so. Why?
You were talking in your sleep.
Did I give away any secrets?
Not really. I didn't quite catch his last name.
Silly.
- Would you like some tea?
- No, thank you.
You sure you feel all right?
Yeah, I feel wonderful.
I wish everybody would stop treating me like an invalid.
I'm sorry.
Look. Anne, there are the mountains.
Anne...
- What happened? Did I faint?
- Now don't worry. It's all right.
Is there anything I can do?
Oh, ah... my name is Alan Brooks.
Oh... I'm Anne Pilgrim and...
- this is my sister, Sarah.
- Hello.
How do you do?
There we are.
I'm sorry about your newspaper, Mr. Brooks.
Oh, that's all right. I've read the baseball scores.
There you are. Spot of that will bring the color back.
- You look like you might do with one.
- No, thanks.
- You have far to go?
- Geneva.
That's quite a run.
[Conductor] Trollenberg.
Next... Trollenberg.
Trollenberg?
Sarah, we're getting off at Trollenberg.
That's my stop.
What's the matter, Anne? You know we have to go on to Gen...
No! I really can't go any further today.
We can stop at the Hotel Europa.
Hotel Europa? We've never been to this place. How do you know about the Hotel Europa?
I don't know.
Anne, what's got into you?!
We're getting off at Trollenberg.
Please, Sarah!
Herr Brooks, I'm sorry I'm late.
Did you have a nice trip, I hope?
Herr Klein, nice to see you again.
Oh, I'd like you to meet
Miss Anne and Sarah Pilgrim.
Herr Klein. He's the proprietor of the Hotel Europa.
I wonder if you can help us out.
These young ladies have arrived without any reservations.
- I thought perhaps you could put them up.
- Yes...
- it will be all right.
- Good.
- Thank you very much.
- The car is outside.
It's very good of you to put us up on such short notice.
Well, this is not yet our season, you understand.
- Oh? I thought now would have been about your busiest time.
- Normally yes, but ahh...
Oh, is... is Hans still working for you?
Yes, Hans is still working for us, Herr Brooks. Thank You.
- Cigarette, Sarah?
- No, thank you.
Anne?
No, thank you.
- How about you, Herr Klein?
- Thank you. I don't smoke.
They shouldn't have started the climb.
- What are you talking about?
- An accident.
Last week. Twelve hundred feet up the south col.
Three English students.
One of them was killed.
Was there an accident,
Mr. Klein?
On a mountain, these things sometime happen.
What else do you know about the Trollenberg?
Peasants are leaving the mountain.
They say it's bad luck.
The mountain people are very simple.
They are superstitious.
All these stories are nonsense.
What stories?
Climbers, disappearing into the mist and never seen again.
- Hans, we have guests.
- Yes, sir.
Hello. You must be Mr. Brooks.
Klein told us you were coming. My name's Truscott, Philip Truscott.
How are you Mr. Truscott?
Klein, you didn't tell us we were expecting other guests.
Oh, this is Miss Sarah Pilgrim and Miss Anne Pilgrim.
Pilgrim? Sarah and Anne Pilgrim?
I'm sure we've met before.
- The name rings a bell.
- Does it?
Would you mind if we went up to our rooms now?
It's all there:
Observatory at the foot of the mountain.
Cable car.
There's a small hut the climbers use.
You can see it from the observatory.
It's all there.
Just like...
Just like what, Anne?
Well, just like...
Sarah, why did
I want to come here?
What is there about this place?
Why do I feel I've seen it all before?
Don't worry about it, darling. Lots of people get a feeling like that.
Perhaps you read about it in a book, or saw a picture in a travel folder.
You mustn't let it upset you.
No... no, I mustn't.
Yes, you're right.
I've probably read about it.
Come in.
- Hi.
- How are you?
Give you a hand?
Oh, I think I can manage.
Lovely spot this, isn't it?
- It certainly is.
- You've been here before, haven't you?
Yes, once, a couple years ago.
Good climbing.
- So they tell me.
- Don't you climb?
Not if I can help it.
Funny place to come for a holiday.
If you don't climb.
Yes, isn't it?
Attractive, those two girls, aren't they?
They certainly are.
Pilgrim sisters, Sarah and Anne...
Of course, I knew I'd seen them before somewhere.
On the Palladium, about a month ago.
They're a mind-reading act.
Funny they didn't say anything.
Well, perhaps they ah... they wanted some privacy.
Can I buy you a drink later?
- All right.
- Good.
Give me zero-x-6-4-6-8, will you?
I want you to check on someone for me.
Brooks, Alan Brooks.
He's just arrived here.
He's American. He's about
40, I should think.
Well, I should try New York first, then Los Angeles, and then Washington.
OK.
Right.
Hello there. You'll be Brooks.
- That's right.
- I'm Dewhurst. This is Brett.
- How do you do?
- How you doing?
- Looks like you're going for a climb.
- Yes, we're going up the Trollenberg.
Gonna have a noggin' before we start.
Care to join us?
All right.
- What's it gonna be?
- Scotch, please.
Scotch and the two brandies.
Better give me a bottle of brandy to take with us.
Keep the cold out tonight.
You gonna stay the night?
No, there's a hut at the foot of the south col.
We'll sleep there tonight and attack the mountain proper tomorrow.
Hello, Truscott.
You must be Miss Pilgrim.
- Yes, that's right.
- Oh, this is Mr. Dewhurst, Sarah... and Mr...
- Brett.
- Brett. Yes.
Do you care for a drink?
I appear to be in the chair.
Wish us bon voyage.
Thank you. I'll have a Campari.
- Truscott?
- Scotch, please.
Campari and another scotch, Hans, please.
Sit down, Sarah.
Your sisters here with you, isn't she?
Klein told us.
- Would she care to join us?
- No, she's having a rest just now.
Quite an occasion for me.
My first climb up a mountain.
Well, yours too, Mr. Brett?
Oh, no.
He's a big voice in the Alpine Club.
How'd you come to take up mountaineering?
Wanted to see if we can't find some good reason for all these accidents.
I'm a geologist, I know all about rock formations and that sort of thing.
Welp, here we are.
Cheers.
- Good Luck.
- To a good climb.
Keep an eye on your roping, won't you.
Why roping, particularly?
- The student business last week.
- That's right, nasty business.
Very nasty.
What was that?
Some kids, climbing on the south col, and one of them fell.
They shouldn't have been climbing without a guide!
Seems he wasn't roped up correctly and the rope got caught up around his neck.
- Strangled him?
- Worse than that.
Tore his head off.
You don't know the half of it.
Tell him what the villagers say, Hans.
It's not for me to...
What do they say, Hans?
Well... the guides who found him, also his friends, they swear the rope was around his waist.
You understand, it was still tied.
But, how could it have...?
The villagers have something to say about that too.
Haven't they, Hans?
Excuse me.
What do the villagers say, Truscott?
They say that it happened before he fell.
As I said, they shouldn't allow inexperienced climbers up the
Trollenberg without a guide.
- There are bound to be accidents.
- Nevertheless, you watch your roping.
We ought to be moving, if we want to make the hut before nightfall.
[German]
Oh, ah, I'm going up to the observatory.
I'll hitch a ride with you in the cable car.
That is, unless you're going to climb the whole way.
Climb the whole way?
Not if I can help it!
See, there are certain chemical changes that can take place inside rock... which cause a physical alteration to its structure.
At times it can become like chalk, break away in hand.
- What do you think of that, Brett?
- Huh?
Oh, I don't think it's like that.
A mountains a mountain.
Some people can climb it and some can't.
Those that can't, shouldn't try.
I'm here under sufferance.
How long do you think it will take you to reach the hut from the observatory?
I don't know.
Oh, about three and half hours.
It's an easy climb.
Professor.
Professor.
How many more times do I tell you?
I'm not to be interrupted.
I'm sorry sir, but there's someone outside to see you.
I don't care. Tell him to go away.
- He says his name is Brooks.
- Tell him to...
- Alan Brooks?
- Yes, sir.
Well, bring him in, bring him in!
No. Wait. Wait.
I bring him in myself.
Alan, my dear Alan.
They all get the sack for leaving you out here. Come in. Come in.
It's good of you to come and see me.
And on your holidays too.
- I was lucky it was in Europe.
You got my letter?
- Yes.
Well, you don't say very much.
What's the matter? You're not pleased to see your old friend?
- [German], professor.
- And how are you, Alan?
Come in. Come in.
Well, Alan, what do you think of our little observatory, huh?
Yes, indeed.
You know, the government gives me as much money as I want.
Come here.
I show you something.
Television?
Better than windows.
Now look.
- Hmm.
- Do you see?
Television cameras on the roof.
We watch everywhere!
You know, the government, the government, they say to me, "Professor, do you have to have such expensive things?
Windows are much cheaper!"
And I say, "I have to have", and I have!
That over there.
That is the only window.
And even for that, we have protection.
Look.
That will stand up to any avalanche.
But that too was very expensive.
All this to study cosmic rays.
Well, Alan, come into my office.
Well, Alan, here we are.
Same old mess, huh?
Well, you're looking very fit.
Fit?
I look the same as always.
Come on, quit your stalling, professor.
You forget I know you.
You said in your letter that it was urgent I see you right away.
What's so urgent?
Well, how long you been here in Trollenberg, Alan?
Got here this morning.
Came right up to see you.
You haven't heard about the accidents then?
Yes, I heard about the students.
Yeah, that was one of them, but... but there have been others.
Many others!
Where people climb mountains there are lots of accidents.
That's true.
And sometimes, the bodies, they disappear.
But here, the search parties go out, and always they find nothing.
Now why is that?
I don't know.
- And then there is the cloud.
- What cloud?
Come on, Alan, you know what I'm talking about.
The cloud where there should be no cloud.
Where there are mountains, there are always clouds.
But this one remains static, on the side of the Trollenberg.
It never moves.
A freak of nature.
A radioactive freak of nature?
- Radioactive?
- Uh huh.
Can we see it from here?
Come, I'll show you.
There you are. On the south side of the Trollenberg.
Alan. Come here.
You see.
Here... here's a map of the area.
This is the Trollenberg.
Now that... that is the scanner.
It's up on the roof here.
Now, you see, at the moment... nothing, no reaction, nothing.
Now remember, here is the cloud.
I turn on the scanner... so.
Now watch when it passes the cloud.
Watch up here on the dials.
Uh huh. Now you see it's past the cloud... nothing.
Watch it go around again.
Watch here.
Well, what do you think of that?
Alan, I ask you to think back 3 years ago, to what happened in the Andes.
- But... but this can't be the same!
- Why not?
We have the accidents like before.
We have the cloud like before.
- Why can't it be the same?
- Too many things missing.
- The mental compulsion...
- What is it?
The girl on the train.
She... she suddenly decided she had to get off at Trollenberg.
She was booked for Geneva.
But she had to get off at Trollenberg!
And did she?
Yes.
She's at the hotel.
There's climbers on the Trollenberg, sir!
Climbers? I thought they were all scared away.
- Where are they?
- 16 degrees west of true north.
2000 meters.
Oh, it's Brett and Dewhurst.
- You know them?
- Just from the hotel.
They came up with me on the cable car.
Well...
They should be all right as long as they stick to their present track.
The cloud is well to the west of the path.
Alan... will you do something about what I've told you?
The cloud? Do what?
Inform the authorities.
Look, I'm on a holiday.
Besides, you haven't told me anything that can be proved.
I've told you about the cloud.
I've told you about the accidents.
What more do you want?
Facts. Proof.
Something that'll look real in black and white on a committee's desk.
Oh no, I'm not gonna stick my neck out again like I did in the Andes.
But why? You were employed by the United Nations.
It was all in the report.
Look, by the time the Andes report was in, there wasn't anything left... in the area, explained or otherwise.
They practically accused me of dreaming the whole thing up.
If I was to take a hand here,
I'd have to have a list... of documented facts and they'd have to be pretty conclusive.
You're an important man.
Why don't you get through to Bern.
Important! I'm only important if
I say something about cosmic rays.
If I say anything else, they tell me to mind my own business.
Maybe... maybe you should speak to Klein.
- The hotel proprietor?
- Well, he's also the mayor of Trollenberg.
Perhaps he could help.
Anyway, he could supply a list of the accidents.
Then perhaps you do something yourself.
You all right?
Take your pack off, man.
You can't relax like that.
Hello?
Yes, Herr Brett.
You're arrived all right!
Good... good.
A nights sleep will set you right.
Yes, all right.
Good-bye.
It was Herr Brett.
They have arrived at the hut.
You see, there's nothing to worry about.
It is just unfortunate that this year we have had many inexperienced climbers.
And what about the rumors in the village?
Well! You know these people, professor.
They are superstitious.
They like to believe in... in fairy stories.
Gentlemen, you understand, officially, there's nothing I can do.
We should be able to make the summit and back tomorrow, if we travel light.
I must have a sack for rock samples.
I think we can manage that.
You can take your sack.
Hmm... visibilities not to good.
- Hope it'll clear.
- Fog? Up here?
No. A cloud, moving down from the peak.
- Will this do, Miss Pilgrim?
- Oh, this'll be fine.
It's quite a collection you have there.
- Now would somebody bring Anne in, please?
- Oh, yes.
Now you'll see that I make no signals to Anne and say nothing.
So it's impossible for any sort of code to be used.
Well done, Alan.
It's a bank note,
French, 500 francs.
There's a number on it.
H...
Oh...
One...
One...
Eight...
Eight!
Well done... very good... ya...
And, who does it belong to, young lady?
- Philip.
- Well done!
It's a rounded sort of object about the size of a tennis ball.
Made of glass.
I think it's used as a paper weight.
There's a model inside it.
A mountain and a little hut.
And when you shake it there's a snow storm.
Snow... mountains... a little hut...
- Two men in the hut.
- Anne!
- Leave her alone.
- The fat one, he's asleep.
Yes, the fat one, he's asleep.
But he's not the one.
It's the other one, sitting at a table, smoking, writing in a book.
He's the one.
He's getting up, he's coming toward the door.
He's reached the door.
He's opening it.
He's coming out.
Up the slope.
Up the slope!
Walking slowly!
No...
Mountains...
Paperweight.
Glass paperweight.
- Please, don't crowd.
- Take her up to her room.
- Hello.
- Hello, Brett?
- Dewhurst here. What do you want?
- Are you all right?
Yes, why?
- Is Brett there?
- Of course he is.
Wouldn't go wandering off in the middle of the night...
Just a minute... hold on.
Dewhurst!
Dewhurst, is Brett there?
Can you hear me? Dewhurst?
Are you there?
Hello? Hello?
Hello? You're right, he's not here.
He must have just gone out.
I better go and look for him.
No, don't do that.
You'll be lost in 5 seconds.
Just sit tight where you are.
I think I should go. There may be something wrong.
No! You're not to move.
Stay in the hut!
- What's the weather like?
- Not very good.
Some heavy cloud coming down.
Well then, stay where you are, there'll be somebody at this end of the phone all night.
If Brett show up, or if you need us, ring us here, will you?
All right. Bye.
Bye.
Brett!
Brett!
[Echoes]
She's coming around, I think.
- Where am I? What happened?
- It's all right, darling.
You passed out.
Now we need something to relax you sister.
A sedative, perhaps?
You have such a thing?
I may have some sleeping pills in my room. Shall I see if I can find them?
Oh, please.
Thank you.
Sarah, could I speak with you for a minute, please?
All right.
I shan't be a minute.
Now, Miss Sarah, I don't want you to upset yourself...
Are these any good?
Oh.
Yes, that's fine.
Now, you give her 2 of these, then come downstairs, please.
All right.
So Mr. Brett decides to take a walk.
- That is not so strange.
- Hope you're right.
How is she?
Well, she'll be all right, I think.
- Did you get through to the hut?
- Yes.
Brett isn't there.
Did you notice how she said... he was coming out of the hut, coming up the mountain side?
It was as though she was watching from on the Trollenberg itself.
Well, Miss Sarah, I wanted to ask you something.
This act of yours, you've been doing it for how long?
About 2 years now.
You don't use a code, do you?
Well, we used to.
And hen we found that Anne could guess what I was thinking before I started speaking.
- But I don't see what this has got to do...
- Please, please...
Your sister's telepathic, no?
Yes, she is.
- I wanted to give up the act.
- Why?
Well, you saw what happened tonight.
It's a dreadful mental strain.
That's really why we're taking this holiday.
Nevertheless, you will take her away from here first thing tomorrow, please.
Take her aw... But why?!
It's not good for her here.
You will take her away first thing in the morning, all right?
If you say so.
Good.
Hello?
Yes.
Yes, he's here.
It's for you, professor.
Thank you.
Hello.
- Hello, Crevett here.
- Professor?
I thought I'd better contact you.
That cloud has started moving.
Yes. It's variation is about 6 degrees.
Radioactivity increasing.
The radioactivity is increasing too, sir.
Wait a minute and I'll find out.
Yes.
Yes, I understand.
I'll be up in the morning.
The cloud has moved.
It is at the foot of the south col.
Where the hut is!
Hello!
Oh, hello Alan.
No, no sign of him yet.
It's foggy as hell outside.
Anyway, I can't see far.
Perishing cold too.
Yes.
Yes.
Hold on a minute.
There's someone outside.
Hang on.
Brett?
Brett, is that you?
False alarm, I guess.
Hang on a minute, I'm just gonna close the door.
Dewhurst, can you hear me?
Dewhurst?
Dewhurst? Hello? Hello?
Dewhurst?
Well?
The phones gone dead.
Hello.
Yes, speaking.
Yes...
I see.
All right.
All right.
It was the observatory.
The cloud has moved away from the hut.
Back up the Trollenberg.
[SPEAKS GERMAN]
We better start now.
It will be light soon.
[SPEAKS GERMAN]
I though the locals were afraid of going up that mountain.
They are afraid.
It's an unwritten law here.
At a time like this, they go up, no matter what.
I have called a spotter plane, but it will not be up until morning.
We will be well on our way by then.
Ready?
- All right, Herr Klein.
- Good.
Look after yourself, Alan.
Don't worry.
I'll stop by the observatory on the way down.
Good.
Be careful everyone.
Here they come.
Professor?
Here they come.
Men,
They're climbing the ledge.
They'll be here soon.
Soon they'll be at the hut.
Keep them away.
Keep them away from the hut.
Away from the hut!
Away from the hut!
Professor?
What's the matter?
Why does she behave like this?
Well...
Well, it's...
It's like a radio receiver.
You see... your sister's mind is capable of receiving signals sent out by other minds, by yours for example.
Now... now there is a stronger signal,
I think, a stronger mind.
It's jamming the wavelength.
But who is it?
Well, we shall know more about that, I think, when they reach the hut.
In the meantime, I say to you again, get your sister out of here before it is too late.
Too late for what?
Well, it's time I was getting back to the observatory.
Too late for what, professor?
When they reach the hut, then we shall know for sure, I think.
The door's locked from the inside.
They must be there.
Mr. Brett! Mr. Dewhurst!
I just looked in through the window.
The place seems deserted.
Philip.
Come here.
These blankets... frozen stiff.
Where are they?
That door was barred on the inside.
- Yeah...
- Herr Brooks!
[SPEAKS GERMAN]
It's Dewhurst.
His head's been torn off.
Anne, we're leaving here today.
No, Sarah.
But Anne, why not?
Look, after last night...
I just want to stay here, that's all.
Now, Anne, I really mean this!
We're leaving Trollenberg today!
All right?
All right.
Now, don't you worry about anything at all.
And I'll go and fix things up.
[SPEAKS GERMAN]
You know these mountains, Herr Klein.
What do you think of our chances of finding him?
Herr Brett is an experienced climber so we can only assume that he's hurt.
[Indistinct] ...the spotter plane should be here any minute.
[SPEAKS GERMAN]
Hey, Alan.
This is why the telephone went dead.
The wires are broken.
What do you make of it?
Never seen that happen before.
I have.
I saw some experiments with excessive cold once.
If wire like this is subjected to sufficient cold, it crystallizes, the structure breaks down.
- Just like this here.
- It hasn't been cold!
- Not cold enough for this.
- Yeah, I know it.
Spotter.
Plane to party. Plane to party.
Are you receiving me?
Are you receiving me?
Party to plane.
Receiving you loud and clear.
What is your position?
What is your position?
Our position: map reference 2-6-5-8-4-3.
Over.
Roger, party. I can see you now.
I shall fly north for 5 miles, then turn west for 5 miles,
- then south.
- Uh huh.
- I shall cover this search area first.
- Roger, plane!
Anne, I...
Hello?
Hello, I want to speak to the observatory,
Professor Crevett.
Hello, party. This is the plane.
I have spotted him.
I have spotted him.
He's approximately half a mile due north of your position.
- Above the north face.
- Roger, plane.
Miss Pilgrim, my name's Wilde.
Professor Crevett sent me to bring you to the observatory.
But I'm not to go to the observatory.
Well, there's nowhere else to go.
It's only a couple hundred yards.
I'm to go up the mountain.
I don't think so, Miss Pilgrim.
I think you ought to wait a while at the observatory.
[SPEAKS GERMAN]
Herr Brett! [Echoes]
[SPEAKS GERMAN]
Swing it 30 degrees west.
- How about that?
- Negative.
- Hugo?
- Negative.
Swing another 30 degrees.
Negative.
Negative.
Try the other circuit.
No. Wait.
Switch back to the first circuit and reverse the scanner.
Now...
Well, hello Anne.
What are you doing up here?
I must go.
- Please excuse me.
- Go? Go where?
To the Trollenberg.
I must go, now.
- Don't let her go, sir.
- Don't worry.
Come along.
Oh, good.
- Alan, I want to speak with you.
- Yeah, I've got news for you too.
Hans, when's the next cable car go down the mountain?
- It shouldn't be long, sir.
- Good. I...
I want you to take Anne down.
Don't let her out of your sight.
Anne, I want you to go with Hans.
He'll take care of you.
Thank you, Hans.
- Well, I've been to the hut.
- And?
Dewhurst is dead.
Brett's missing.
Not that I'm surprised, mind you.
The cloud has started moving again.
What cloud?
Oh, I don't think you'd understand, Philip.
Like that time in the
Andes, do you mean?
How do you know about that?
All right, I'm a newspaper man.
It's my job to know about these things.
I see.
I chased that story when we got a wind of your report, Alan.
When I got there it was too late.
Looks as if I'm going to be more fortunate this time, doesn't it?
Yeah. Fine. Fine. That's... that's just what we need.
You haven't answered my question, professor.
- What question?
- Is this the same as it was then?
Seems to be.
So what happens now?
The United Nations have a special team for investigating phenomenon.
I call them in.
Does the... theory that you put forward last time still hold, professor?
What theory?
Visitors from outer space.
That was it, wasn't it?
- Well, what else?
- Well, what are they?
What do they want?
Look, Philip, there are many galaxies besides ours.
Now, who knows what is happening millions of miles out in space.
Perhaps the world that these creatures inhabit is coming to an end.
Perhaps the need to find somewhere else to live.
- Well why pick on us?
- We don't know it's just us.
Maybe it's also Mars, Venus, Jupiter.
Who can tell?
Do you go along with this?
Until someone comes up with a better theory...
Yes... yes I do.
All right.
All right, while we're theorizing...
Why, do you think, do they always happen to land on the tops of mountains?
First the Andes, and now the Trollenberg.
Well, it's the atmosphere, I think.
You see, it gets much thinner high up.
Well, perhaps these creatures need that.
The cloud would seem to indicate this too.
Creating their own atmosphere.
Well, if they can only exist on the tops of mountains they're hardly likely to inherit the earth, are they?
You see, anyone can get used to anything, in time.
Now these movements we have recorded here, each time lower down the mountain.
Acclimatization perhaps?
What next, professor?
The next move is up to you, Alan.
You must inform the authorities!
Have you seen the professor?
He's in the office with Alan Brooks.
They're telephoning Zurich.
Any sign of Mr. Brett yet?
Well, the plane spotted someone he thought was him, and 2 of the searchers went to meet him.
The others are back.
They saw nothing.
Well, if it was Brett, they aught to be back by now.
- Where's your sister?
- She's in her room.
Good.
You think she's safe from our "friends" up there?
Well, I don't think they'll try the same thing again.
Trouble is... what will they try?
Herr Brett... you all right?
A bit tired, otherwise all right.
Where have you been?
We had search parties out for you.
I was lost.
- Dewhurst get back all right?
- When did you see him last?
- Dewhurst?
- Yes.
- Last night I saw him.
- At the hut?
Yes, at the hut.
It's a bit hot in here.
Pour me a drink, Klein.
Have one on me.
- Let me help you.
- Sorry.
Thank you.
- How's your sister, Miss Pilgrim?
- She's all right now.
Where is she?
- She's in...
- Here... have a cigarette.
Bit nervous, I'm afraid.
Pretty scary up there on your own.
Were you all on your own?
After I lost Dewhurst.
I'm sorry to be a nuisance, but may...
Look at his head.
There's no blood.
That should take care of him until the morning, I think.
Good.
The UNO team will be here tomorrow and Dr. Frekard can have a look at him.
Do we tell the others what he was trying to do?
I don't know.
I don't know about you, but I could use a drink.
Alan, what is this all about?
Brett behaving like that, I mean.
You read the Andes report.
Don't you know?
Do you mean to say something like this has happened before?
Oh, that part of the report was hushed up.
There was an old woman down there.
She was clairvoyant.
The villagers thought she was a witch.
Actually, it was case of more than ordinary sensory powers.
Crevett was able to hypnotize her.
She was remarkably sensitive to outside suggestion.
You know, mental suggestion.
Under hypnosis, one can tell these things.
Well... it was about the same time as we first observed the cloud.
She started having these trances.
It was a though some mental compulsion was working on her.
She began seeing things.
We planned a course of hypnosis to try and find where these compulsions were coming from, but... we never did start it.
There was a man... he went up the mountain.
He'd been missing for 24 hours and then he came down.
His co-ordinations were not quite right.
Just like Brett.
The first opportunity he got, he took a meat axe to the old woman.
We got there about
10 minutes later.
Both dead.
How did the man die?
Crevett...
The man had been dead already 24 hours.
I know, I know, it's impossible, of course.
But you see, there are certain changes which take place in the body after death.
They follow a pattern that can not be altered.
The man had been dead already,
24 hours. There was no doubt!
I was unfortunately unable to perform the autopsy.
The police took over.
Are you trying to tell me that Brett is like that?
That... we've just been fighting a... dead man?
We believe that he was sent down that mountain by... whatever's up there, for the express purpose of killing Anne Pilgrim.
They can't afford for
Anne to be alive.
She's a threat to their security.
They tried to entice her up there.
Now they've tried this.
- Neither's worked.
- So what do they try now?
I don't know.
- Professor?
- I don't know, either.
But whatever it is, we won't have to wait long to find out.
Alan!
Alan!
Alan!
Oh, Alan!
Alan!
Wake up! Please!
Alan! Please!
Alan!
Alan! Come quickly!
Alan!
- Alan, look at this.
- What?
Hans, bring the light closer.
Now put it lower. Lower.
Put it on the floor.
You see the way the flesh reflects the light?
It's almost as though it was crystallized.
Like meat that's been deep frozen.
I still don't understand how such a...
Alan, the observatory's just been on...
That clouds moving again.
It's coming down the Trollenberg, towards the village.
Hans, I've told you, you're wasting your time. That phone is dead.
The wires have been cut.
- We gotta get up to the observatory.
- But we must...
You heard what the professor said.
That place is built like a fort.
If we're going to have any direct contact with these things, at least we'll have some kind of chance up there.
It's insane!
We should try to get out...
- to the valley!
- The road is blocked. The cloud stretches right across it.
Alan?
- We'd better get moving, eh?
- Yes. Yes. You.. you go in the next cable car with the girls.
- You got everyone?
- Nearly everyone.
Got 12 left.
One has all ready gone up and the other one will be down in 10 minutes.
- Who is that?
- It's Hans.
All right everybody, let's get up to the cable car as quickly as we can.
We haven't got very much time.
- Got everything, Philip?
- Yep.
- Hey, what about Hans?
- He's driving through that cloud!
Professor, are you sure we're doing the right thing, coming up to your observatory?
Right or wrong?
I don't know.
What I do know is it's wrong to stay down in the village.
Up there, we stand some chance, at least.
Professor, look, on the lower slopes, the cloud!
It's moving faster.
I hope they see it down there.
The operator says it is 5 minutes now.
Good.
Alan!
The clouds moving pretty fast now.
Please folks, I'd like for you all to be ready to load in the car as soon as it gets down.
We haven't got a second to spare.
It's nearly at the hotel.
If only we could see into that cloud at least we'd know what we were dealing with.
Well, we'll know soon enough.
It seems to have stopped at the hotel.
Yeah, well, as long as it stays there, we're all right.
At least that cloud lets us see where it moves.
Let's get aboard as quickly as possible, please.
That's it.
Hurry along.
Please, ma'am, please.
[SPEAKS GERMAN]
Of course... the child!
If that cloud starts to move this way before I get back, take the car up, understand?
- What about you?
- Do as you're told!
Stay!
[SPEAKS GERMAN]
Tell her that Mr...
All right, let's get in the cable car.
That's it.
- That was a close shave.
- It was.
We're not through yet.
Remember the telephone wires at the hut?
Yeah.
This contraption operate in extreme cold?
- We work the cable car at 30 below.
- Colder than that?
It never gets colder than that.
The cable, it will snap!
All right, quick, everybody out!
That's it.
We're leaving the villagers out here, sir. It's just as safe, and they won't get in the way.
- Are the radios still working?
- We checked it about 15 minutes ago.
Oh, Alan, come here.
- Alan, we are in big trouble.
- What now?
- The cloud is splitting up..,
- Splitting up?!
There are 4 of them now.
And all moving this way.
- How long before they get here?
- An hour, maybe.
Then we've got just an hour to decide what we're gonna do.
Better check that radio again.
- You're going to signal the authorities?
- To tell them what?!
What do you use against these things?
- High explosives?
- Bombs?
The time the plane get here, those things will be all over us.
How do they drop their bombs then?
- Sets still working OK, sir.
- Good.
Let me see that thing again.
There's someone knocking at the outside door, Herr Wilde.
- It's Hans, from the hotel.
- I'll let him in.
There are 5 of them now.
And all moving.
Well, if we don't make up our minds pretty soon, they'll be made up for us.
Hans, what's the matter?
What happened?
The cloud, it was straight across the road.
I turned the car and came back.
You all right?
Yes.
I'm all right.
Thank you.
It is so hot in here!
Stay here with the others, Hans.
You'll be all right soon.
Thank you.
[SPEAKS GERMAN]
I know it's a lot to ask, Sarah, but I don't see any other way.
Anne, where're you going?
- I'm just going to sit down in the office.
- All right.
But how can Anne help?
She doesn't know anything.
We don't for sure that she can. But Sarah, we've got to try something.
Obviously, she has some kind of contact with these things, whether she know it of not.
I thought perhaps with you controlling her thinking, we... we might be able to learn something about what we're dealing with.
I suppose we could try.
Professor, it's the thermometer on the south col, it's going down all the time.
- It's 45 below.
- And still dropping.
- It's a cloud location, isn't it?
- There is a cloud there, yes.
Wait a minute.
Say it's cold they need.
They live in cold. Remember the phone wires at the hut?
And Brett complained of being hot after he was infected.
- Yes.
- And Hans too, he complained of the heat.
Supposing that...
Hans? What about him?
He arrived a few moments ago, said he changed his mind about trying to escape. He complained...
- Where is he?!
- Out in the corridor.
- Where's Hans?
- He went inside a minute ago.
- He came in here.
- Well, where can he... Anne!
No, Sarah, no!
Wait, my dear, please.
Poor devil.
- Anne!
- She'll be all right, I think.
Wilde. Better take care of him.
How thick are these walls?
- I don't know, 2, 3 feet, maybe.
- Fireproof?
Well, yes, they're reinforced concrete against the avalanche.
Good. Hugo, get on the radio,
United Nations in Bern. I want to talk to Colonel Spellman.
Now that Anne can't help us anymore, there's only one thing left.
- What's that?
- What I said before.
Every time we've come up against these things there's been this intense cold.
Remember you said that Brett looked like he'd been in a deep freeze.
Heat! That's what we've got to use.
I'm going to ask for a bombing raid.
- You said that was impossible.
- Fire bombs, that's our answer.
Through to Bern, Mr. Brooks.
- Got any petrol?
- Yes.
Fine. Get it. And all the jars and bottles you've got.
I think a bit more in that one.
That's fine.
Be sure and get that rag stuffed in there tight so the petrol won't leak.
May I have your attention, please?
I don't want anyone to leave this corridor unless I say so. Understood?
In the meantime, get as many of these ready as you can, and be careful of them, they're dangerous.
And I can tell you that help's on its way. Thank you.
- Alan?
- Yeah?
How we gonna use these "bombs" of yours?
You light the rags and throw them at those things in the cloud.
Alan, come here, quickly.
Look at this.
- Cute little things, aren't they?
- Yeah.
I'm gonna throw a bomb at that one. You watch on the screen and see what happens.
Would you all go up to the far end of the corridor, please?
Except you, you come with me.
I want you to slam this door behind me and wait for me to knock to come back in.
If I don't knock, don't open it, right?
All right.
Get me a couple more of those bottles.
- I saw it on the screen.
- Those things can really move.
We really got to get a direct hit or surround them with so much flame they can't get out.
- Let me try one.
- All right.
Alan, there's one on the roof!
It's taken Philip!
Thanks.
- You all right?
- Yes.
Thank, Alan.
- Now what?
- I don't know.
We can't go out that door again, that's for sure.
It's the only way in or out of this observatory, I've checked.
No more bombs then.
Not these.
- Well, what do we do then?
- I don't know.
There's nothing much we can do, but wait for that airplane.
What are they doing now?
- Can't tell anymore. They block out the cameras, you see?
- Yeah.
Jolly Roger to observatory.
Jolly Roger to observatory.
Receiving you loud and clear.
ETA in 5 minutes. Over.
Mr. Brooks, I'm through to the plane.
He says ETA in about 5 minutes.
Good. Tell him to make a straight run over the observatory and drop his bombs on the roof.
I hope he knows what he's doing.
Hello, Jolly Roger.
- Hello, Jolly Roger.
- Jolly Roger to observatory...
- No change?
- None.
Repeat. Waiting your instructions.
Over.
Hello, observatory. I can just make you out through a great deal of low hanging cloud. Over.
Tell him to bomb the cloud.
Hello, Jolly Roger.
Drop first stick across observatory and cloud. Understand?
Bomb the cloud as well.
Over.
Wilco, observatory. Sounds crazy to me, bombing a cloud. Over.
- Do as you're told! Over.
- Yes, sir. Out.
Stand by, everyone.
The target is that cloud.
I'm going in to take another look.
Now all we can hope is these wall will stand the heat of those bombs.
Well, we shall know soon enough.
I'm gonna try a high level attack first.
Here we go.
Steady.
Steady.
To your right.
Visual on.
Steady.
Bombs away.
Standby for low level attack.
Oh, Wilde, tell the villagers they can go down the mountain any time they'd like.
Yes, sir.
How about a breath of fresh air?
- I'd love a breath of fresh air.
- Come on.
Well, Sarah, doesn't look as though you'll have to worry about her any longer.
- No, it doesn't.
- Cigarette?
Well, Alan, for the first time in weeks, the Trollenberg is free from cloud.
Yes, and let's hope it stays that way!
Created with VisualSubSync and Subtitle Edit.
    - You know who that was?
    - No.
             Major Lincoln Bond.
I wonder what he's doin' back here.
                       I wonder.
   Edwards to General Banner,
   I can see it again.
     It looks like the fire
     is back to the wing.
'Roger, Edwards.
I can see it now in my mirror.'
  'I'm reducing power
  to idle position. Stand by.'
     General, this Mickey McKee.
 I don't see any fire now.
 Is your warning light still on?
   'Affirmative, Mickey,
   no fire in the mirror now'
    'but the warning light's
    still on.'
'I'm stop-cocking the throttle, and comin' in.'
 Okay, we'll be all set for you.
     I want crash trucks
     at both ends of the runway.
  Calling Crash Control,
  we have an F-102 in trouble.
  Give us equipment
  at both ends of the runway.
  You got fire again, general.
  Don't try to land, bail out.
      'Relax, Mickey,
      we'll never locate'
     'the cause of the fire
     that way.'
  'If I can't make the runway,
  I'll land on the dry lake.'
Don't try it, she may get worse.
Get out while you can.
   'Negative, I'm coming in.'
I'm sorry, Lt. Sweeney, but only the rescue party is allowed in the crash area.
It's still dangerous, ma'am.
        - You too, sir.
        - Okay, captain.
            Mm-hmm. Yeah, I see.
   Oh, what's his condition now?
   Hmm, good.
What about the plane, any report come through on it yet?
               What do you know,
               it's Major Bond.
   - Welcome back to Edwards.
   - Thanks, Jerry.
Just visiting.
    - What'll you have, sir?
    - Scotch on the rocks.
                      Coming up.
                      How is he?
 Hospital says he's okay.
 He'll be back at work tomorrow.
          I was afraid this time
          he'd had it.
     Excuse me.
     Major Bond, meet Major Lee.
Bromo Lee?
I've heard about you.
     I've heard about you.
  I saw the general coming in.
With that much fire, you'd have thought he'd have bailed out.
   Looks like you don't know
   General Banner.
  He's allergic to abandoning
  any aircraft..
    ...if it's still flying.
    Well, it's getting late.
          - Goodnight.
          - 'Night.
Bromo's been making quite a name for himself with those speed and altitude records.
               Oh, I don't know.
      Always figure we got
      other pilots just as good.
         But he rates number one
         with General Banner.
      'There's no question
      about that.'
           Tell me..
...the general still doing a lot of tests, like the one tonight?
  Are you kiddin'?
  He flies more than his pilots.
      Especially the tough ones.
That's what I hear.
     Mickey.
   You should know better, Linc,
   this is no way to do things.
Well, maybe I should've come in through the back door.
             The idea is to give
             a little notice.
 Why, we have a band that jumps
 at any excuse to start playing.
They'd need a better excuse than me.
                 Sit down, Linc.
Well, since you having made general obviously, you've been doing something else with your time.
               Well, I just had
               another daughter.
All by yourself?
        No, there was some woman
        around at the time
           by the name of Sarah,
           I think.
I think so too.
How is she?
    They're all wonderful, Linc.
   Well, you didn't come
   all this way just to find out
         that we're loaded
         with kids at our house.
 Mainly, I came all this way
 to get away from where I was.
           Washington? I thought
           that's the place
       where everything happens.
  Not any of the things
  that I know anything about.
 You know why I'm here, Mickey.
   I want a job test flying.
         Yeah, I know.
  And I know all the questions
  you've got to ask
     before you can give me
     any sort of an answer.
   First, "Am I alright now?"
            Are you?
           I'm fine.
     All I need is a job
     that I know I can do.
  I know what a spot
  it's putting you in to ask.
         That doesn't bother me.
          The only thing
          that really matters is
             are you sure
             you're alright now?
      'Maybe you need
      a little more time.'
           I'm okay.
                    I don't have
                    to tell you
           if it were up to me
           you'd already be set.
  It goes without saying that
  I'll put in a request for you.
    Then it's up to the general.
Banner?
Is he everything they say he is?
     He's a real good man, Linc.
What's his attitude going to be about me?
                 Let's find out.
                 Come on.
    Hi, Connie. Any chance of
    seeing the man for a minute?
 Probably. You're ranked pretty
 high around here, you know.
'Yes?'
     Col. McKee would like
     to see you, general.
        - 'Send him in.'
        - Yes, sir.
See how easy it is when you're ranked pretty high?
       'Thanks, Connie.'
Oh, by the way..
I think this is what
Sarah means when she says
I'm always putting my foot in my mouth.
Anyway, there's a guy outside
I think you used to know.
  I used to know lots of guys.
That's what I mean.
So, you probably know this one.
         Linc.
                  Hello, Connie.
This is a fine thing to do to a girl.
             Well, I didn't know
             you were here.
 - Last time I heard you were--
 - I was in dating.
That was quite a while ago, Linc.
                Yes, yes it was.
General Banner requested me here about a year ago.
                             Oh.
You would've known all this if
I hadn't started feeling silly about all those letters
I was writing and never getting any answers.
           Yeah, well, it wasn't
           that exactly, I--
Lots of time can pass before you even know it.
                           Yeah.
            Well, all in all,
            wouldn't you say I..
  ...look a lot younger
  than you've ever seen me look?
I was thinking that but...
I couldn't find just the words.
Good Ol' Linc... he can always tell when a girl's about to go completely to pieces.
I haven't even asked you what you're doing here.
                Well, I'm trying
                to get a job
     which no one seems to think
     I have a chance of getting.
You'll never know until you ask.
           Well, it used to be..
           knew before I asked.
              Well, things have
              a way of changing.
Don't they just?
          Connie, how about
          having dinner tonight?
I'd like to, but..
I'm afraid I'm going to have to work tonight, Linc.
     Well, couldn't you tell him
   that a ghost out of your past
   showed up unexpectedly?
The general is a man who doesn't believe in ghosts.
But if you're going to be around for a few days..
         Not if the news is bad.
Well, I better be getting back to my desk.
Oh.
         Connie, isn't there
         something you could do?
        I mean about the dinner.
I'm afraid not, Linc.
If I'd had any warning..
...but of course you didn't know I was here.
Goodbye, Linc.
  But, general, I wouldn't be
  asking you to assign Bond if..
 Look, he wasn't a collaborator.
         Oh, wasn't he?
 A confession he made to
 the Chinese about germ warfare
      sounded a lot like
      collaboration to me.
     Alright, so he signed
     a piece of paper.
 But not until he'd held out
 for 14 months of brainwashing
       and gone through..
     Hell, who knows
     what they go through.
              But more important
              than anything..
     ...before he went to Korea,
     he was turning into
        the most promising pilot
        I'd ever run across.
          He had natural ability
          and judgment.
  And what you need more
  than anything else right now..
                   ..experience.
What I need more than anything else right now is pilots I know I can count on under stress.
I'm sorry, Mickey, that doesn't sound like Bond to me.
           But who knows how bad
           the stress got?
           Maybe nobody could've
           taken it any longer.
Maybe.
   He tried to kill himself by
   slashing his wrist, you know.
     We turn down good men
     every week.
  How can you ask me to lower
  that standard for Bond?
 Bond met those standards when
 he came here originally, sir.
     There's no use
     trying to convince me.
     It doesn't matter
     how I feel personally.
 What matters is, that I have
 pilots I know I can count on.
  With Bond, I wouldn't know.
   That's all there is to it.
Believe me, it's a rotten decision to make.
 It looks as though
 I was giving him a final kick.
It  wi be the final kick, sir.
      If it is, I'm sorry.
 That doesn't change anything.
                Well, it looks
                as if we've won.
           Maybe full production
           on the XF-120.
  Great. It's about time too.
        I gotta go fly.
Well, you're in the right branch of the service for it, general.
Never without a word on the subject, these civilians.
      You were right.
      I used to know him.
I was sure I had the right girl.
    Oh, general...I'd like
    you to meet Major Bond, sir.
    - General Banner.
    - Glad to meet you, sir.
Haven't I seen you before?
      I don't believe we've met.
Thanks for trying to pry me out of there last night.
             Well, sir, I wasn't
             doing much good.
                 The rescue boys
                 got you out.
About your request, Bond
I'm afraid I'll have to turn you down, I'm sorry.
Too bad you had to come all the way out here.
           It meant a lot to me.
Look, if you'd be interested in anything else around here except test flying..
- That's nice of you. sir.
- You let McKee know if you are.
Where are you staying?
        I piled in last night
        on Joe and Polly Craven.
   From all the fuss you'd think
   they were glad to see me.
   - Great actors, those two.
   - Yeah.
In our theater group they don't come any better than Joe and Polly.
    - When are you leaving?
    - Tomorrow morning.
      In case you don't know it,
      I'm having dinner tonight
                with the Cravens
                and the McKees.
      Thanks, Mickey,
      I know how hard you tried.
See you later.
  Well, you know what
  it was like during the war.
       No place to eat,
       no place to park.
   Luckily, of course, we had
   only two children then.
Only two..
Sounds like a whole gang to me.
      Believe me, Linc,
      two children aren't enough
           to completely destroy
           a large house.
         Stick around a few days
         and you'll see.
    Absolutely, Linc, and you're
    not gonna leave tomorrow.
    You just can't do things
    like that.
    Just pop in after
    who knows how many years
    then turn right around
    and pop right off again.
  Before anyone's had a chance
  to get used to you again.
Now, why would you want me and my long sad face around?
It may be long and sad, but it's a familiar face.
    Andf I think old friends
    are the best friends.
            She didn't read that
            any place.
       She made it up
       on the spur of the moment
         just for this argument.
You better watch yourself, pal.
This is the kind you wind up marrying.
          Don't worry,
          I'll keep my guard up.
       Don't you agree?
       If he did marry me
               it'd be nice
               for the children.
'Don't worry, you'll find out.'
       Not at this rate,
       I won't.
    Connie told me
    she was working tonight.
  So what? It's already 10:30,
  they worked until ten
    and then Connie dragged
    the general down here
  for a little Saturday night
  relaxation.
   You know, I think I'll ask
   that girl for a dance.
                      Uh, Linc..
Nothing, I was just gonna wish you luck.
            Thanks.
   - Why didn't you tell him?
   - Why didn't you?
  There's nothing for anybody
  to tell anybody.
    He's just gonna ask her
    for a dance, isn't he?
      - Evening, general.
      - Good evening.
      How are you, Connie?
I was afraid you'd take off before
I had a chance to see you again.
    You've heard of
    the perennial bad penny.
 And I hope, sir, you've
 heard of the universal custom
    of asking an attractive
    young lady to dance.
                  Oh, I've heard
                  of it alright.
     I can't say that I
     particularly approve of it.
             But if it's alright
             with her, major.
It's alright with me.
        Thank you, sir.
        You know, a lonely major
        can find himself
     flying with his wings
     cut off
  by making a pass
  at the general's girfriend.
          It isn't that exactly.
But it is something.
      Well, we've been going out
      quite a bit together
      and you know how
      those things are built up.
      How serious is it, Connie?
       If somebody asked me that
       yesterday, I..
...would have said pretty serious.
       - What's changed?
       - Stop it, Linc.
              You know very well
              what's changed.
            You don't sound
            very happy about it.
                   Why should I?
             What's there to be
             happy about finding
         you still get disturbed
         about someone
      who hasn't even given you
      a thought for over a year?
  - You know better than that.
  - How?
  That big stack of letters from
  you that I treasure so much?
        Like old times,
        isn't it?
    I don't think it's much
    like old times, do you?
Oh, I'm sorry, sir.
I certainly didn't mean to disturb you but there's been trouble at the rocket testing station and I--
         Alright, Sweeney,
         pull yourself together.
        - I'm leaving right now.
        - Oh, yes, sir.
   - So, you're at it again.
   - Oh, it isn't my fault.
    Being a general's aid's
    a lousy position to be.
  I-I-I didn't mean that, sir.
     It was an unfortunate
     choice of words--
   - Alright, Sweeney.
   - I'll go with you, Bill.
 No, it's early, you stay here
 and have a little fun.
    You can bum a ride with
    the McKee's or someone
       I'll see that she
       gets home, sir.
       Yes, the major
       can see you home.
       Thank you, major.
      - Alright, Sweeney.
      - Yes, sir.
       Why don't we leave
       by the front door?
Thank you, sir.
       - Goodnight.
       - Goodnight, sir.
But at least somebody's on my side.
               Just pray that
               it isn't Sweeney.
Why won't you tell me about Korea?
    Honestly, Connie, I'd rather
    tell you about it
         than anybody else but..
      ...it'd be like two people
      trying to communicate
   with each other,
   each in a different language.
            I just don't think
            you'd understand me.
Alright, then let's forget it.
From now on, if anybody asks you anything you tell them to check with me.
     I don't want a whole lot of
     people checking with you.
              If it's scars
              you're looking for
                I've got some
                worse than that.
I just wanna be sure they're all healed.
Gone as far along toward healing as they can without some help.
What kind of help, Linc?
    I need somebody to show
    some confidence in me again.
      Believe me, I never needed
      anything so desperately
               in my whole life.
            What it amounts to..
                ...I guess, is..
  ...starting from scratch and
  selling myself all over again.
   Ever try to sell something
   that nobody wanted to buy?
         - Connie, I--
         - Don't, Linc.
           - Why not?
           - Why not?
 Linc, you can't just wander
 back here after all these time
    and pick up right where
    you left off.
You're not the only one that things have happened to since you've been gone.
And believe me, you're not the only one who's been hurt.
You hurt me bad, Linc, real bad.
Taking me in your arms isn't going to help me forget it.
                        Connie..
You talk about needing someone to show some confidence in you..
Why couldn't you have shown a little in me?
Didn't you know that no matter how cut up you were mentally or physically, you could've come right back to me and that's all
I would've cared about.
   Perhaps I needed some time
   to pull myself back together.
I didn't want you all together.
I wanted you all the pieces.
So I could show you how much I loved you by helping you get back.
'I'll try to make it brief, sir.'
  'I'd like to quote something
  you said in a speech once.'
You said that the most important requirement of a test pilot
      is the desire to be
      a test pilot.
No doubt about it.
       Well, that I've got, sir.
           And I think my record
           will back me up.
         Then you went on to say
         that the second-most
           important requirement
           is stability.
That's right.
And since you brought up your record, I..
Go ahead, major.
   Well, sir, unfortunately,
   at this point
    the only way I can prove
    my stability
      is for somebody
      to let me prove it.
      Also, unfortunately
   nobody who's in a position
   to let you prove it
   could possibly ignore
   everything on your record.
    No, sir, they couldn't.
  The only reason that I'm
  taking up more of your time
    is to try to impress you
    with my complete desire
      to be a test pilot.
  In regards to my stability,
  I..
    ...I think I'm qualified
    there again, sir.
    I'm sorry but the answer
    is still no.
Alright, sir, may I take you up on your offer of last Saturday?
         Some other job
         on the base?
   You didn't seem
   very interested Saturday.
       What made you
       change your mind?
    Well, when it came time
    to leave, I..
   I realized that even if
   I couldn't do test-flying
  I'd still like to be around
  where it's being done.
     I'm afraid I've gotta
     say no to that too
       because it,
       it wouldn't work.
        And I quote you
        right back..
  You mentioned your complete
  desire to be a test pilot.
    We both know that there
    isn't any substitute.
 But maybe there's another way,
 a better way.
 Nobody knows all the answers,
 least of all, me.
But I do know some testing procedure.
Suppose you have to determine the stability of an experimental aeroplane, how would you proceed?
    I'd work up to it, sir,
    step by step.
   Exactly.
   You nibble at the problem.
  Now, on that basis
  I'm going to change my mind.
     I'll go along with you
     for that first step.
  I'm willing to re-assign you
  as a test pilot.
But you'll be limited to chase and pace.
None of the major projects.
   - I understand, sir.
   - Alright, it's up to you.
      Yes, sir.
      Thank you, general.
           - Bill..
           - General.
     Senator, may I present
     General Bill Banner
     he runs the show here.
  I've been hearing about you
  for years, Banner.
  Thank you, sir, I hope
  you had a comfortable trip.
     Very smooth. General Shelby
     is a good pilot.
      Don't tell me you finally
      broke down and got an aid.
    Yes, sir.
    Gentlemen, Lt. Sweeney.
Lieutenant.
    Isn't that Lincoln Bond?
'Yes, Bromo's checking him out on the XF-120.'
- How long has he been here now?
- Little over two months.
I was surprised when you took him here.
       - How's he doing?
       - Alright so far.
That about covers it.
And remember she's got a high rate of sink.
Your first landing, come in flat with plenty of power.
 - Hard to judge the flare out.
 - Roger Wilco.
And try to bring it back in one large attractive piece, huh?
         I'll bend every effort.
       - All checked out?
       - Yeah.
              I get to do it
              all by myself now.
This makes just about everything on the base you checked out on now, doesn't it?
                     Just about.
How you coming along with Bromo?
       I'd say, I was
       winning him over, slowly.
At least, he stopped foaming at the mouth every time my name's mentioned.
    That's progress.
    You can't get away from him.
           'Right..'
I'll see you later.
'That was flight 745 taxing.'
         Quite a view.
Sixty four square miles of level rock-hard landing surface.
 We figure you save the country,
 a quarter of a billion dollars
     in safe emergency landings.
   Edwards is one of ten centers
   under General Shelby
         and Aero Search
         and Development Command
         but it's developed into
         a pretty big operation.
         I have over 8000 people
         on duty here.
  There's our rocket engine test
  station right over there
                 in those hills.
     High altitude speed course,
     deceleration track.
             All this is just
             a bird's eye view..
     Oh, there's the Gilbert 120
     taking off right now.
'Yes, Mr. Gilbert was telling me we really got something there.'
Before I came here, I thought you tested mainly airplanes at Edwards.
Just what is your mission?
  Quality. Flying hardware of
  better quality than the enemy.
   Not just the aircraft but
   the power plant, the armament
 the RADAR, everything that goes
 with the vehicle
           to make up a complete
           weapon system.
   How long have you been in
   command here, Bill?
          Well, it's going
          on six years now, sir.
         I'm just really getting
         broken in, Senator.
 What it boils down to, is this.
   Our whole future air strategy
rests on the accuracy of the data, our guys pass on to the planners at Washington.
I'd call that a good sized responsibility.
   We try and pick the good ones
   and throw out the bad.
What was that?
 Sonic boom. An aircraft
 penetrating the sound barrier.
You're looking at an engine right now with enough thrust to reach outer space.
     - What's stopping you?
     - Money.
   Then the guiding system.
   We're still perfecting it.
'Attention! Final warning for ten second countdown.'
  This high speed track is the
  world's fastest
    and straightest railway.
 - 'Ten. Nine.'
 - Sled'll do 1500 miles/hour.
   'That way we can make
   some tests on the ground'
  'without risking the pilot.'
'Five-four-three-two-one.'
'Fire!'
   Senator, there you see
   an Air Force tanker refueling
       a bomber and two fighters
       at the same time.
'Yes.
A B-66, an F-100, an F-101.'
 'Some of our latest aircraft.'
        - Bye, Senator.
        - Thanks a lot.
    - Goodbye, general.
    - It's a pleasure, sir.
           Carry on.
 We just intercepted a radio
 call, Mickey, what's going on?
 Major Bond just called in, sir.
 Having trouble with the 120.
             Says he's got
             aileron on reverse.
'Edwards Control to Major Bond.
What's your present position?'
I'm eight miles south to the lake at 22000 ft., Edwards.
    I'm trying another roll
    to the same side.
'There she goes again,
Edwards Control.'
I think I've got something else.
 I've got wrinkles in the skin.
 My left wing.
This is General Banner, how bad are the wrinkles, Bond?
     - Not too bad, sir.
     - Can you land safely?
   - 'Affirmative, General.'
   - Alright, bring her in.
 - Keep checking on that wing.
 - Roger.
'Control to Major Bond, you're cleared'
   'for an immediate landing
   on runway 22.'
 - What'd you do? Pull ten Gs?
 - No, sir. Less than five.
     - Report to my office.
     - Yes, sir.
 Did you authorize Bond to carry
 out any stability tests?
    No, sir. It was strictly
    a check up.
      - I recommend, sir--
      - Yes, Connie?
   - Major Bond is here, sir.
   - Send him in.
        Come in, Major.
    What's the story, Linc?
    It's the wings, General.
They won't take the design load on a rolling pull out.
       Until, they're
       beefed up stronger
     you've got
     a dangerous airplane.
      Somebody's gonna
      pull the wings off.
    I don't agree, General.
I pulled more than five Gs with no sign of structural weakness.
You must've exceeded design limits.
  It happened exactly at 4.5 Gs.
You must've pulled more Gs than that. Maybe you blacked out?
  No, sir, I didn't black out.
  I'm sure it's gust loads.
Hitting few bumps for a fraction of a second would do it.
    If it could happen to me
    it's gonna happen to others.
  Bromo Lee is plenty capable
  of running phase four tests
 on that aircraft. You were up
 there for familiarization.
 Why did you start
 your own private test program?
 Sir, I stumbled on a condition
 that didn't feel right.
    I wasn't looking for it.
But when it happened
I thought I oughta pin it down.
            Alright.
But Gilbert's chief engineer tells me, you must be mistaken.
      Maybe he can explain
      the wrinkles, sir.
    The question is
    what really caused them?
  You're telling us, Major Bond,
  we're committing ourselves
 to mass production of a fighter
 with a dangerous defect?
                 Yes, sir. I am.
    Mickey, is the other 120
    in commission?
 It'll be ready tomorrow, sir.
 Set it up for me. Linc, I want
 you to fly chase.
And help me duplicate the exact conditions you encountered.
  General, since Bromo's been
  directly responsible
  for this project, it'll save
  time if he flew with Bond
       on the first one.
Save my time? What do you think
I'm here for, Mickey?
        Very well, sir.
 That's all for now, gentlemen.
Bill, you suppose bond pressed the panic button up there?
             I'm gonna find out.
How do you feel about his reliability?
               It's this simple.
If I were commanding an army and he was guarding my left flank
   I'd be running there every 30
   minutes to check up.
Why you wasting your time on him?
  Well, because what I said just
  now is a personal feeling.
      I'm gonna judge him on
      performance, nothing else.
You know, Bill, this X2 may well be as far as we can go with a human pilot.
And expect him to survive.
                    Yes, I know.
How soon are you starting tests with rocket power?
 Not for several months.
 We've lot of blind drops to do.
Decided on our pilot for it.
        I'll take that one, sir.
      That's been my pet project
      from the beginning.
  I've watched six years, nine
  million dollars and the brains
   of 280 engineers go
   into that X2. Excuse me, sir.
  - Banner.
  - 'This is Harvey Gilbert.'
               Yes, Mr. Gilbert.
'What's this about wrinkles in the wing? Is it true?'
              Yes, that's right.
              News travels fast.
'...accepting his report?'
        We don't know yet.
        We'll find out tomorrow.
Of all people, we don't consider a brainwashi qualified
        to say we've got
        a bad airplane.
   I'd like to come up there
   right away.
   Fine, we'd be glad to see ya.
  Alright, Mr. Gilbert, goodbye.
     Well, he's in a real storm.
Well, I can't say I blame him.
I'm equally concerned.
Bill, running Air Research and
Development Command has turned into a tremendous responsibility.
I could sure use you at my headquarters.
   How soon do you think you can
   wind it up here?
Wind it up sir?
Oh, I can't leave this job now right in the middle of all the new projects we're getting into.
Not that I don't appreciate your asking me.
I know there's no job more important than yours.
    I'm glad you agree we're not
    exactly an old man's home
        back there in Baltimore.
    Leave some of the strenuous
    testing to Mickey and Bromo.
                     The others.
Oh, it's good for the circulation, General.
     Just remember, you and I
     aren't getting any younger.
Yes, Connie.
                 I have the 104
                 data here, sir.
Oh, good let's have a look.
That's all.
         - Hey, Connie?
         - Yes, sir.
Do you think I'm getting old?
            Well, I'd say that's
            the usual procedure.
I mean maybe I'm too old to compete with these youngsters around here.
       - You mean flying?
       - All departments.
        In experience, I'd say
        you're older than Moses.
          But you seem ten years
          younger than you are.
It's a good definition of what the commander here better be.
You know, Connie, one thing
I'm not going to do is get my brains knocked out at any high school competition over you. I'd lose that one.
All I'm asking is that I be the first one you tell.
              Of course, I will.
            The first thousandth
            of a second, I know.
    Oh, wait. Mr. Gilbert,
    this is Major Bond, sir.
         - Mr. Gilbert.
         - Oh, yes.
            Lincoln Bond.
            Structural Engineer.
         Just a pilot,
         Mr. Gilbert.
             Very modest of you.
  I was just talking with
  Gilbert's chief test pilot.
    He inspected the damage
    and frankly he thinks
    you're out of your mind.
    However, I'm going ahead
    with the test anyway.
           Yes, sir.
Give me a double. Honest double.
Do you mean that, sir?
   Yeah, I wanna see how four
   ounces of alcohol
  affects a flyer's judgment.
    Connie, I didn't know you
    were working the West Coast.
Linc, you've a real important day ahead of you tomorrow.
   They're all important, honey.
  It's just that some are little
  more depressing than others.
       However,if it bothers you
       to see me to lush it.
              I'll wait it out
              until you've gone.
What's the matter? You're afraid you're wrong?
I have a feeling I've never been right a day in my life.
It should show one way or other shouldn't it?
          It should but then you
          never know.
I know one thing, mister.
Anybody who's thinking about having any kind of tussle at all with Bill Banner had better think it over carefully because he's really in the heavy weight division, Lincoln he belongs there.
   Yours could hardly be an
   impersonal opinion, could it?
I just know the General in question never ran away from a thing in his life.
He faces things head on, Linc.
And when he does, people always wonder what hit them.
There was a time when I thought that you and the General were two of a kind.
 Let's just chalk it off to
 girlish enthusiasm, shall we?
         Just a minute.
    Hi. Am I still under
    the 10 o' clock curfew?
              Yes.
 - Well?
 - Since you made it. Come in.
 I juts want it made perfectly
 clear that even if you hadn't
    waded into me with those
    bitter, stinging remarks
   I still probably wouldn't
   have taken that drink.
  Because I believe basically
  people don't change.
 I'm a man who's never run away
 from anything in his life.
 I don't know whether you know
 it or not, Connie
  but I've always been a man
  who's faced things head on.
 Whenever I have, people always
 wondered what hit them.
  If you've ever had any other
  impression of me
       you've been wrong.
       Unfairly wrong.
I should be boiled in very warm oil.
    - At least.
    - How about some coffee?
  No, sir, because I've got
  a very important day tomorrow.
 And I believe a man should get
 to bed early before such a day.
Well, hurray for you,
Horatio Alger.
      Thanks for the help, lady.
Any red blooded girl interested in experimental aircraft would've done the same.
   Ha ha. Hey, that's very good.
      About the red blooded girl
      interested
       in experimental aircraft.
       Very good indeed.
 You know all the people around
here who think I'm going crazy like Gilbert's chief pilot, he's an awfully good man, Connie.
     Maybe I did read those
     instruments wrong.
  At Red Prison they got me to
  where two and two
       looked like five.
       Maybe I am crazy.
I'm betting my own money that you're right in this thing.
    Sure, what do all those
    old highly trained engineers
                  know about it?
Will you please relax, Linc?
        It'd be too smooth today
        at 20000.
Well, if we don't find the right conditions there, General
Bromo reported some turbulence lower down.
  All set, Bond. Now, give me
  the exact conditions.
      Okay, General, start
      a shallow dive.
      Stay 40 knots below
      critical Mach number
       at 95 percent rpm.
  Pull 4.5 Gs and a steep bank
  to the left.
'Then give it, three quarter air rock.'
             Roger.
    What is this,
    you're giving us, Bond?
  Everything's normal.
  I pulled more than 5 Gs too.
'I'm afraid the air is too svelte at this altitude.'
   'No gust blows that time.'
'I'll try lower over the mountains at the Pass.'
       'Ought to be bumpy
       enough there.'
'Roger.'
'Giving it 4.5 Gs now, Bond.'
  I can't find anything wrong.
I guess we're not getting quite the same conditions, General.
You mean wrinkles in the wings, you're right. Returning to base.
             Roger.
Well, Mr. Gilbert, everything's seemed normal to me.
     That's not conclusive.
The fact remains that one of my pilots did get wrinkles and till we find out why, Mickey
I want the phase four test
 done over from the beginning.
 Assign Joe Craven to work with
 Bromo on the 120 full time.
   - Double check everything.
   - Yes, sir.
  I'm all for caution, General
  but it can't be overdone.
      Specially in view
      of...circumstances.
    I repeat I think
    you're airplane is okay.
  But if there's one chance
  in a million that Major Bond
   stumbled on something.
   Now's the time to find it.
    I'm confident you won't
    find anything.
  Unless the design limits
  are exceeded. Right, Major?
         Who knows, Mr. Gilbert
         what a limit really is?
It's funny.
Trippin over my own feet.
Me and my big feet.
        You don't look too well,
        General.
Oh, I'm alright.
  The flu's going around. You
  oughta see the flight surgeon.
Flight surgeon?
No, I feel fine.
You've been General Banner's friend longer than anyone else.
I suppose it's occurred to you he can't stay here forever?
       Oh, I hadn't given it any
       thought, sir.
     You know how he flies
     all the winds himself.
   Finds it hard to delegate
   responsibility?
Mickey, it's time to think about another commander.
            But his whole life
            is test flying, sir.
Naturally it'll be an important promotion.
               Boot him upstairs
   when every pilot on this base
   would crawl on his belly
              to Chicago for it?
Mickey, what he's got in his head is too valuable.
General, he wouldn't understand.
  Do you want to risk losing him
  to some big company
     like Gilbert Aircraft?
I know he's had some fancy offers.
That's where you come in. I'm talking to the next commander.
   Start getting ready. Take all
   the load off General Banner.
Aren't you placing me in an awkward position, sir?
  Let's say an unusual position.
       One that involves loyalty
       to General Banner.
I don't know what to say, sir.
             You know him better
             than anybody.
Nudge his elbow every chance you get about the challenge.
The bigger challenge waiting for him in Baltimore.
       I'll try, General.
     But you're handing me
     an awful big pair of shoes.
  Okay, sergeant, pop it out.
With this amount of drag, you'll drop from 20000 feet
                    like a rock.
       We figure 4000 feet
       to be the lowest altitude
         you can get rid of this
         deceleration chute
 with a safe margin to pull out.
Suppose the electrical release mal-functions
    have you got
    a manual release for me?
        Yeah we've installed one
        just in case.
Good. You know the old saying,
"If it can go wrong, it will."
  You wouldn't change your mind,
  would you, General?
 You know, I've been kinda
 hurting to do this test myself.
You've got enough to do.
I can't spare you right now.
I was thinking, sir, Linc Bond's got this current as anyone
 on this F-94. They want you
 pretty badly at the conference.
            I think he'd be okay
            to do this test.
You know my policy, Mickey, Bond is limited to chase and pace.
           Well, I knew that was
           your policy, sir.
       But he's been putting out
       harder than..
          I think he's really
          earned the right, sir.
I know he's putting out.
Just leave it that way.
 You see what I mean about Bond?
'He's been bumming rides in the
B-66 in his spare time.'
     'I don't when
     the guy ever sleeps.'
You're pressing, Mickey. So is
Linc. Pressing too hard, maybe.
Trying to prove something.
That alone can make him a risk.
Oh, thanks.
Oh, never mind, Connie.
No more coffee.
I think I'll knock off.
Why don't you take off, Connie?
You're probably late for a date.
                 That's alright.
That reminds me. When's that wing-ding Lillian's giving?
   - Thursday night.
   - I guess we'd better go.
  Help celebrate Joe Craven's
  promotion.
      When you said we, were you
      including me?
Of course. Why?
Somebody else ask you?
  Incredible though it may seem,
  somebody did.
                   Lincoln Bond.
Make a note in your book to remind me to ask you sooner.
That won't be necessary. You did ask me over a week ago.
     I told Linc,
     I was going with you.
      Hmm, that's a mark
      of a good commander.
     Instinctively he does
     the right thing.
      - I did.
      - You certainly did.
   But don't you go assuming
   I would've said no to Linc
      if he'd asked first.
 Oh, before you go. The mayor's
 appointment tomorrow.
    Will you be down
    from your test by nine?
   Better change him to 9:30.
  And operations called about
  your chase pilot.
 Bromo has to go to El Centro.
     Mickey's tied up too.
 They said Bond was available.
    - Alright, make it Bond.
    - I'll tell them.
   - Thursday night, then.
   - 'Affirmative, General.'
   Okay, Bond, I'm deploying
   the chute.
             Roger.
    You fouled up, General.
    You're only half open.
 Getting plenty of drag though.
 - I've got 4300 feet, General.
 - Roger.
     It's about that time.
     There she goes.
 - You've strung up the shoot.
 - 'I know it.'
   Both release
   has mal-functioned, Linc.
 Well, maybe I can land anyway.
 The chute's only half open.
    Negative. Might open
    all the way any second.
'If it does, you'll spin like a top.'
     I'm gonna have to try
     to snag the chute.
 Don't try it, Linc. Pull away.
        That was close.
      Can you hold
      that position, Linc.
   I'll have to hold it
   right through the landing.
I don't want the chute to pull lose and open again.
   Okay. I'm landing straight
   ahead on the lake.
             Roger.
 For Pete's sake don't lose me.
  We'll leave everything as is
  until they photograph it.
                       Yes, sir.
Well, Linc, how much do I owe you?
            A couple of bucks
            ought to care of it.
Two dollars, huh?
A minute ago my neck wasn't worth two cents.
Well, no sweat, huh?
                       No sweat.
           Lucky we didn't
           need the rescue boys.
Yeah. They would've been a little late.
Too far out.
You know, Linc,
I can't figure you out.
In these emergencies..
Well, it just doesn't jibe with that business in Korea.
Of course, you never did tell me your version of it.
I wish you would though.
Maybe if I understood what really happened.
Something beside the inhuman treatment.
What they use?
Drugs, truth serum?
                        No, sir.
Well, it just doesn't figure.
Even with torture, you're not the kind to crack.
What made you do it, Linc?
  Have you ever been in solitary
  confinement, general?
               Tortured mentally
               24 hours a day.
     Physical torture is nothing
     compared to the things
          they've learned
          to do to a man's mind.
That covers it, huh?
            Well, it's something
            entirely new, sir.
                 If a man hasn't
                 been through it
              it's no use trying
              to explain it.
Look, I'm trying to give you a break.
Give me something to go on.
   What does it take, general?
You think I'm hard to convince, huh?
Well, I am.
I always have been when the test date issued a flaw.
Can't you give me a better reason?
            I wish I could, sir.
Well, at least you showed me something today.
Another step, shall we say?
And if I step you into something more important what's your first choice?
                  Rocket flight.
          X-2 project.
Ah, that's a big step.
Too big maybe.
I always had
Mickey and Bromo in mind
  to work with me on the X-2.
However, Bromo's still got his hands full with the Gilbert job.
- I'll talk it over with Mickey.
- Yes, sir.
      ♪ Off we go into the
      wild blue yonder ♪
             Crash!
        Come on, Carmen.
            Come on.
   You don't want me to have
   to right in my log book
     that you're
     uncooperative, do you?
 I'm not going to your quarters
 for a nightcap
       or anything else.
       I just wanted you
       to see how much
      my wonder box
      geraniums had grown.
        Sure...you did.
        Come on, Carmen.
            Come on.
         - Hiya, Jimmy.
         - Hello, Linc.
 How about all this
 fancy dan flying you're doing?
          Trying to make
          Chuck Yeager look bad?
Chuck could fly better than that before he ever saw a plane.
   So much modesty to be in just
   one little old Korean hero.
A couple of real sharp chase pilots you got tonight.
                 Chase is right.
           I don't like him very much.
Mickey.
        The only man now alive
        who's flown an aeroplane
                 with no wings..
           ...faster than sound.
I was in a hurry.
It's just no way to live.
You're always so jumpy and jittery and popping right out of your skin every time you hear his voice.
           Just because I always
           try to be cognizant
                     to my duty.
Don't know what that means, but I do know all he has to do is say hello, and you shoot up 14 feet.
  Debbie, I wish you'd try not
  to exaggerate every time.
        Hello, Sweeney.
          Oh, oh, oh!
Honestly, you did it again.
You embarrass me so much!
    'Why do you always
    do that sort of thing?'
         His heart's going
         to give out long before
      he makes first lieutenant.
Ha ha!
                    Oh, so soon.
Well, Joe and Polly have finally gotten here.
Let's go.
    - Hi, Joe.
    - Good evening, general.
Those look awfully good, colonel. Congratulations.
      - Thank you, Connie.
      - You too, Polly.
    - Congratulations, Joe.
    - Thank you.
   What does his promotion
   really mean to you, Polly?
Well, for the first time in our marriage, food on the table.
        When did we get a table?
      I'll be right back.
Alright.
    Any messages for anybody
    in the powder room?
No. But on your way past the bar
     would you mind telling
     my husband
     that his leave from me
     has just expired?
    I always like to be
    the bearer of bad news.
            Then as we pulled
            into a steep climb--
   You will be sorry to hear
   that you were just shot down.
  Sarah's reeling in her apron
  strings again, is she?
             Oh-oh!
   I was saving that
   to go to camp this summer.
             But..
Here you sit all by yourself and there are literally 50 girls
        who are drooling
        for you to ask them out.
You know that, but nobody ever tells me.
       Nobody tells you.
 I suppose that little red head
 at the PX isn't telling you.
    Every time she sees you
 she goes into
 that exaggerated model's walk.
     She throws her hips
     out so far you wonder
  if they're ever coming back.
Well, I assume, naturally that she has some sort of trouble with her back.
        Aren't you going
        to join us at the table.
Oh, I was afraid a man all by himself would put a crimp in the fun you couples are having.
            You're just a lonely
           wanderer, aren't you?
I don't think so.
          Well, I hope I see you
          at the table.
             Have a drink on me.
No, thanks, Bromo.
I was just leaving.
           Yeah, maybe your wise
           at that, buddy-buddy.
       'Cause I hear you've been
       bucking real hard
   for the job tests on the X-2.
          And I kind of consider
          that belongs to me.
Good luck.
       I don't like you, mister.
     I'll go home and stick
     my head in the oven.
    Oh, I got a better idea.
Let's go outside, and I'll knock it off for you.
        Come on, Bromo.
        I've got--
              No.
Hey, don't hit him again.
He's drunk.
Linc!
                He held my arms.
              He shouldn't
              have held my arms.
How could you hit him?
      You didn't see
      what happened, Bill.
 It was on account of that man
 over there trying to stop him.
      Whatever it was
      you better get home.
           Yes, sir.
Come on, men, give him a hand.
Connie.
Let's get back to the table.
        We can't just..
         Alright, Bill.
         You go ahead.
     I'll only be a minute.
             Linc.
                If only that guy
                 hadn't held me.
I know, Linc.
I know.
        Look, Connie,
        you're with the general.
             You better go back.
It's perfectly alright.
    Please, it's bad enough now.
I want to talk to you.
        Go on back in, will you?
Better go in there, and explain how it happened.
          That's the worse thing
          I could do.
I know he'd understand.
         Better for him to think
        that I go around socking
        helpless people
                   than peg me
                   for a psycho.
You've got to do something.
                 Leave it alone.
- I'm going back to the base.
- I think I better go with you.
           Don't you understand?
      The general gave me
      my chance and I muffed it.
If he gave me another, I still wouldn't have the right to..
Finally it happened.
Blew my top.
That's what they've all been waiting for.
   Nobody's been waiting for it.
    They're pulling for you.
    Everybody.
It's going to be alright.
         You still don't get it.
              I'll spell it out.
   The Reds hammered me
   to my limit and broke it.
    I put a patch over it,
    and hoped it would hold.
  For months now, I've been
  praying that it would hold.
       Trying to hide it.
    Now the patch is pulled off.
                      It's over.
No, Linc, it isn't.
                  It's all over.
                Goodbye, Connie.
       - Hi there, Linc.
       - Hi, Hank.
    - The party over.
    - No, it's still going.
What are you doing here so late?
  We got a glide drop coming up.
         Hope you get in on her.
         Been making any hit way
         with the old man?
Afraid not.
Just thought I'd drop by and see how it was going.
  You, uh, changed the stick?
             Yeah.
  Moved it half an inch forward.
        Go ahead and try it out.
                     Any better?
I'd even give it a little more.
Of course, it's not up to me.
I wish it were.
       Well, you're about the
       same size as the general.
    Like sitting in the nose
    of a guided missile.
       I guess that's what
       it would be like, alright
        when she carries a man
        right up to outer space.
           Only I'll never know.
      You'd like to Hank,
      wouldn't you?
                   Be the first?
Who wouldn't, Linc.
             Yeah.
'And to have this kind of behavior'
   'from two of our officers'
 'well, it...it's just not the
 sort of thing we point to'
 'with pride in the Air Force.'
      I just can't drink.
      I know that, sir.
 But you proved you could stay
away from it, Bromo for three years until last night.
Now since this is your first slip with me
I'm gonna leave it this way.
Some people just can't drink.
If you ever take another, your career in the Air Force is over
I'll see to that.
      I think the general
      can count on me.
              Yes.
       'Sir, can we give
       out a statement'
    'on the chute emergency
    yesterday?'
 No! I don't want the
 drag chute story released yet.
         - 'Yes, sir.'
         - Not yet.
      'How do you want me
      to handle it, sir?'
 - We've had several inquiries.
 - Alright. Then hold them off!
              Yes.
    Sir, major here is Bond.
I mean Major Bond is here, sir.
          Send him in.
I was about to send for you.
Have you talked to any newspaper men?
                        No, sir.
Somebody leaked a premature report on our chute emergency.
I dropped by your quarters last night.
Where were you?
  I returned to the base,
  and then to my quarters later.
You weren't there when I looked for you.
   Excuse me, general, it'll
   save a lot of questions--
Just let me handle the questions.
 The big question is what am I
 supposed to do about that show
 that you put on with Bromo Lee
 in a public place?
If I ground you you'll be dead weight.
       If I take strong--
 May I say something, general?
    I came in here to resign
    from the Air Force.
So you're, you're ready to quit, hmm?
      I never should've started.
You had to start somewhere.
I appreciate your giving me a chance against your instincts.
Let's say in spite of my prejudice.
             Your first judgment
             was right, sir.
Have a seat, Linc.
What I wanted to talk to you about last night..
                     No, thanks.
...I got to thinking that over.
It just didn't add up.
You slugging Bromo Lee.
Unless there was something else.
     That's right, sir.
     It was a mental thing.
     That's why I want out.
  I was about ready to put you
  into the X-2 project.
So you want to admit failure, huh, Linc?
Look, I've gone along with you this far
I'd feel like it was my failure too.
   I'm sorry, sir. I'm just
   afraid I'd mess things up.
Ever read William Faulkner?
         Yes. Most of his stuff.
Well, than maybe you'll remember something he said when he accepted the Nobel Prize.
   It's sort of, sort of goes
  to the heart of the job here
  at the flight test center.
   Something like,
   "Man will not only endure
       he will prevail."
         Some men, yes.
You'll never know where you'll find it, Linc.
 Excuse me, sir.
 It's Col. McKee. An emergency.
Craven's having trouble, sir.
Aileron reverse, she just snap rolled on him.
'Chase pilot to Craven.'
   'Chop your throttle, Joe.'
 'Just turn everything loose.'
  Okay, Joe, you're out of it.
           Level off.
Craven from Gen. Banner.
You okay, Joe?
'No sweat now, general.'
   'but I was real busy there
   for a minute.'
   'I sure got the reversal.'
   General, I've got wrinkles
   in both wings.
        'How bad, Joe?'
      Worse than Bond got.
        Chase to Craven.
        Hold your level.
       I'll have a closer
       look underneath.
 Wrinkles underneath too, Joe.
    I'm afraid you're
    gonna have to leave her.
'Chase pilot from Gen. Banner.'
       'You're sure it's
       that bad, Harry?'
     Affirmative, general.
The wrinkles are flexing bad in the left wing. May come off.
     General, I still think
     maybe I can land.
       Negative, Joe.
       Get out, get out.
        - Bail out now.
        - Okay, general.
 But I'd like Harry to get some
 pictures of those wrinkles
      before I fire myself
      out of here.
 'Use your own judgment, but I
 advise you to bail out now.'
   Hardly take a minute, sir.
          Okay, Harry.
     'I'm ready to eject.'
         'Stay clear.'
'Bail out, Joe.
Joe!'
       'Can you hear me?'
       'Bail out!'
    'Joe, fire the canopy.'
        'Joe, bail out.'
     Joe, fire the canopy.
     'Get out of there.
     Fire the canopy, Joe.'
'Too late, general.'
  'His chute opened too late.'
Just the instant before he hit.
            Are you sure, Harry?
      'Positive, general.
      He was too low.'
    'Never had a chance.
    He...he's had it, sir.'
           Well, I guess there's
           nothing we can do.
        I let him wait too long.
It's not that, sir.
He, he never answered any calls.
He must've been knocked out.
          Mickey, you know Polly
          better than I do.
     - It might help--
     - I can tell her, sir.
 Only Linc really knows Joe and
 Polly better than any of us.
      - Maybe..
      - Do you mind, Linc?
   - No, sir. I'll tell her.
   - Thanks.
  I'll send the flight surgeon
  and the chaplain over later.
   - 'I'll drop in shortly.'
   - Yes, sir.
   Why do they always have
   to have two or three kids?
          Hiya, Linc.
          Come on in.
        Hi, Uncle Linc.
     Daddy hasn't come home yet.
Hi, Uncle Linc.
            Polly..
  Maybe we'd better go inside.
              Joe?
          I heard it.
He was..
Well, it was instantaneous.
Let me get Sarah McKee for you.
                        Not yet.
         Please, just excuse me,
         will you, Linc?
     You know, I've been
     ready for a long time.
  Kids, how about going to
  Aunt Sarah's for ice cream?
Yeah, yeah!
      Okay, let's go.
      Thanks, Uncle Linc.
        How'd she take it, Linc?
General, she's got more guts than anybody you ever saw.
               Think she's ready
               to see me yet?
Yes, sir. I think she'd really appreciate it.
           I want to thank you
           for going over there.
   We've got a big job ahead
   of us with this X-F 120.
   Major modifications
   on that wing and all that.
   It'll be your project
   of course if you want it.
- Sir, I appreciate that very--
- Ah, Linc.
I hope this has knocked out all ideas of your resigning.
      Well, general, it hasn't
      changed the primary reason
                that I felt
                I should resign.
   The fact that Joe went in
   still doesn't change the fact
            that I went
            sky high last night.
Why shouldn't you have gone sky high?
If a man's taken a lot of nasty beatings while somebody's holding his arms he'd have to be an insensitive idiot not to react violently when he felt somebody was holding his arms again.
What would you do if you got out?
You'd make a rotten insurance salesman anyway.
            I wouldn't care
            to argue that point.
     Well, sir, if I'm back
     on the payroll
     what you said about working
     into the X-2 rocket program
           sounded awfully good.
Alright, Linc, you've got it.
                 Thank you, sir.
          Okay, Linc.
          8000 feet.
      Count off for drop.
       Five, four, three
          'two, one.'
            'Drop.'
Hank, I'm still getting a little buffeting in the nose.
   Stability could be better.
'Stalling action, good.'
         Linc to Harry.
      Are you sure my nose
      wheel is straight?
                     How was it?
You ought to know.
       - Wow!
       - Same way I felt.
That was really something, Mickey.
But the real charge would be with rocket power.
      The old man's set on doing
      that himself.
          I think it's
          a younger pilot's job.
 - I know.
 - I got this much out of him.
      I get to do this next drop
      with partial rocket power.
I want you to get qualified to be my launch panel operator.
Well, that's something anyway.
      Passing 20,000 feet.
    Launch panel cameras on.
     Selector switch, off.
      Count for jettison.
       Five, four, three
          'two, one.'
        Locks, jettison,
        switches open.
       Come off the X-2!
       Come off the X-2!
        Get out, Mickey.
        Get out quick.
   Bond to pilot.
   Drop her! Drop her quick!
'Yes. Yes, sir, that's right.'
'Well, what happened?'
'We don't know, general.'
 'They told me she just blew.'
      Something more Barn,
      but we haven't--
'Well, anyway, this settles it.'
     I'm not taking anymore
     chances with you.
     On the test
     with full rocket power
      you've got to assign
      somebody else.
      The day I can't run
      my own show
     I'm turning in my suit
     for a different model.
'Don't be pig headed, and stubborn.'
'I'm sorry, but if you tie my hands--'
'Nothing personal, Bill.'
       'I'm just thinking
       of the Air Force.'
'Yes, general,
I appreciate that.
'But we need you here in Baltimore.'
'Okay. But not until this one's finished. This one's mine.'
'Remember what I told you.'
'We're not getting any younger.'
'Yes, sir. Goodbye.'
  That was a real close call
  for Mickey McKee, wasn't it?
                    Yes, it was.
Mickey said you must've been almost psychic.
As if you'd had premonition.
            I don't go for that.
         The instruments weren't
         reading quite right.
   Anyway, testing is based
   on facts not premonitions.
   Linc, there's still one thing
   after all this time I don't
   understand about test flying.
             What?
Why anyone should want to do it?
Well, why do you think?
   I haven't the slightest idea.
At first, I thought maybe it had to do with something silly like
 proving to each other
 what real good he-men you were.
      But I never met one of you
      that needed to prove that.
     Maybe it's the money.
No, I'm serious.
It's a mystery to all the other women I know.
  Well, part of it is the
  excitement and satisfaction.
             Doing something
             for the first time.
                  The challenge.
       That's a very small part.
            When you love flying
     you know that the aeroplane
     wants to fly right.
You get a compulsion to make it as perfect as you can.
 But with you and Bill and the
 others, it's almost fanatical
        like a religion.
               Ever heard of
               a good ballplayer
       who lived much
       of anything but baseball?
Or a woman that didn't know that the...only really important thing in life was having children?
  But that happens to be true
 because if we didn't have them
 where'd you get
   all your ballplayers or..
          Test pilots?
         That's right.
 Is Bill Banner still planning
      to fly the big test
      in the new X-2?
              Yes.
        Should he do it?
    Have you or Mickey explained
    to him that he shouldn't?
 No, Gracie Allen, we haven't.
    Just the same, if Bill
    shouldn't fly that test
      and everybody knows
      that he shouldn't
 then somebody should tell him.
       Yes, they should.
       Linc, I'm almost..
   I probably shouldn't ask.
  But what's Bill going to be
  up against in the X2?
  Well, you can't say exactly.
   First time a man goes over
   a hundred thousand feet..
     ...three or four times
     the speed of sound
 hits the heat barrier
 where the friction of the air
   makes the wings white-hot.
And the pilot has a fraction of a second to make decisions.
    Why did they have to use
    anything as dangerous
       as rockets anyway?
    There isn't any choice.
         No other type of engine
         develops enough power.
           Those two rockets
           in the tail of the X2
          give it enough power
          to drive a battleship.
Linc, do you have any idea?
Well, any premonition about Bill?
      I don't have premonitions.
             Connie, you've said
             Bill four times?
      If it weren't Bill
      it would be another pilot.
You know it's Bill.
             Yes, I guess it is.
            Well, I got an early
            take off tomorrow.
     - 'Do you have to go?'
     - Yes, ma'am.
Goodnight, Linc.
At least I'm glad it doesn't have to be you.
   You haven't understood a word
   I've been saying, have you?
    I'd give anything if it were
    going to be me up there.
           And I'd give anything
           if it were me
          instead of Bill Banner
          down here.
         I don't know.
   She oughta be ready for
   a try at full rocket power
    but how can you be sure?
    This time she's going
    right out of this world.
Let's face it, Hank, you'll never be sure.
      Maybe one more time
      with one rocket.
     I don't see why, Hank.
   Mickey and I have already
   done three more drops
   than we did on the old X2.
       Everything is
       checking out okay.
      Maybe you're right.
      Well, whatever
      General Banner says.
Yeah. See ya, Hank.
Any chance he'll let one of you fly?
           Not a prayer,
           you know the general.
     Thanks for the coffee.
  Tomorrow's okay with Hank
  if it's okay with you, sir.
         Then it's on.
       Something else
       isn't okay though.
      Ever since you went
      to Baltimore, Mickey
  there's been new heat
  on me to delegate this test
      to a younger pilot.
   Now I get a TWX that's
   a next thing to an order.
     Did you have anything
     to do with this?
  They pinned me down, general
  I gave them a straight answer.
       Younger pilot,
       you for instance?
                             Me.
                        Or Linc.
        We've been friends
        for a long time, Mickey.
           If I can't depend on
           your absolute loyalty
I'd better get me a new director for flight test.
       If it's a question
       of loyalty, sir
  that'll never be necessary.
                           Okay.
        Alright, wheel and deal.
               Set me up for
               an 05:30 takeoff.
           Yes, sir.
May I speak to the general privately?
      What's on your mind, Linc?
Well, sir, I never wanted to ask a favor.
 Pretty hard to turn you down.
   Well, what I mean sir is..
    ...I'd like to make this
    next flight in the X2.
- You too?
- I hope I'd earned the chance.
     I've flown in her
     as much as anyone now.
      I don't know what's
      the matter with you.
   We know this
   is gonna be a rugged one.
       That makes it
       my responsibility.
    I have a responsibility
    too, sir.
       That day in
       the locker room..
    - What about it?
    - You almost passed out.
- That could happen in the air.
- I told you, I tripped.
      We both know
      what happened, sir.
   I think the flight surgeon
   would agree with me.
You'd go to the flight surgeon?
    I didn't say that, sir.
    I know best whether
    or not I'm safe to fly.
      General, may I speak
      off the record?
        Go right ahead.
I know what it's like to go through hell.
I've been there, and I failed.
And I would've failed here too if it hadn't been for you.
You gave me your confidence and your respect.
                  You earned it.
      Not my own respect.
 'You reached your limit once
 but that was all in the past.'
     You would've held out
     until they killed you.
         Keep talking.
I think I've faced myself on that score.
Have you faced yourself?
Have you faced the fact that with your stubborn pride your blind egotism and time catching up with you
     'you could jeopardize
     this whole project?'
        That's enough--
If you keep this up your failure can be greater than mine was.
   You're the only man alive
   that could say that
   to me that I'd listen to.
       Is it true, Linc,
       is it that bad?
    I wish I didn't have
    to be the one to say it.
      Do the rest of them
      think the same?
    I can't speak for them.
      Well, I'm not making
      any promises.
   But I can't fly them all.
       Somebody else will
       get their chance.
       But not this time.
       I still wish you'd
       change your mind.
   I guess that's all, Linc.
      Very well, general.
And I think you can count on the zero wind for the landing.
               Hello, Linc.
               Hank, come on in.
         - Coffee?
         - No, thanks.
             What's the problem?
      Well, sir, it isn't
      exactly a problem.
      Hank was
      wondering whether..
    Well, maybe you better
    tell the general, Hank.
General, I've been going over the figures again and could we have one more drop at half power?
Just one rocket?
I know you're anxious to go ahead--
  I'm not that anxious, Hank.
       Not until
       you're satisfied.
Then I'd suggest, sir that Major Bond repeat exactly the same test he made last week.
   Well, the only thing
   I don't like is the delay.
'I'd really feel better, sir.'
   What's your opinion, Linc?
   Well, sir, everything checked
   out normally on my last test
      but it would give you just
      that much more information
      before using both rockets.
        Certainly couldn't hurt.
          Okay, Hank,
          I'll approve one more.
You take it up, Linc.
You'll be getting a piece of what you want anyhow.
'I appreciate it.'
       After Bond's test
       set me up
      as soon as possible
      for the final test.
  - Both rockets, full power.
  - 'Yes, sir.'
            'Linc.'
     How about flying Chase
     for you tomorrow?
                   Okay, Mickey?
             Okay.
'Weather report's still okay for take off time?'
       'Affirmative.
       Wind's subsiding.'
    - 'Forward tank filled?'
    - 'Check.'
     - 'Aft tank filling?'
     - 'Check.'
'Operations inform Bond we still have a zero wind for takeoff.'
    'Affirmative, he knows.'
   That liquid oxygen
   is really frosting up now.
      Snow's beginning
      to form on the skin.
How do you feel, Linc?
  I always get a few butterflies
  with rocket power.
         Yeah, so do I.
  But using one rocket you can
  stay below 70,000, alright.
                No problem, sir.
       - Good luck.
       - Thank you, sir.
       - Good luck, Linc.
       - Thanks, Bromo.

'He's fired both rockets.'
- He's got full power, general.
- I know, I heard it.
What does he think he's doing?
       Did you give him
       a choice, general?
       Later, Hank.
       Talk to me later.

         'I can't. I..'
    Ask Bromo if he's still
    in contact with Bond?
      Bell control to Major Lee.
   Are you still reading the X2?
'Negative.'
     'His transmission
     was getting garbled.'
  'The last I heard, he was
  firing the ejection system.'
                      Thank God.
The flight surgeon is here, sir.
And Colonel McKee.
Send them in, Connie.
            Come in.
How is he now, doc?
  He's gonna make it, general.
Good.
      Near as we can tell
  a wind blast tore open
  that experimental face plate
      at high altitude
      and passed him out.
      And he's got a mild
      brain concussion
      and an injured hip.
Ah, Linc's a pretty rugged customer.
       He had to be.
       It was that close.
 He's still coming out
 of a severe case of the bends.
      Call for excellent
      physical condition.
Oh, I know that.
 Frankly, sir, a pilot your age
 wouldn't have had a chance.
 Well, sir, I better be
 getting back to the hospital.
Thank you, doctor.
Well, Mickey, I've been here a long stretch.
Seems like a lifetime.
      Tests that came out
      okay, and some bad.
'But in a way they were all successful.'
What I meant to say Mickey..
...I've got news for you.
I'm transferring to headquarters
Air Research and
Development Command.
I'll recommend you to succeed me.
     We're gonna miss you, Bill.
I know you'll do a great job.
           - Thanks.
           - Coffee?
No. thanks, Connie.
   About Linc's flight, sir.
 General Shelby's headquarters
 wants to know
  if he violated orders
  going to full rocket power?
Of course, he didn't violate orders.
I left it up to him.
Verbal orders.
   Then we better amend this
   operations order, officially.
         - In writing.
         - Alright.
It's amended.
        - Line of duty.
        - Yes, sir.
  Connie, what are your plans?
   I imagine I'll stay here.
Of course, I'd love to have you go with me.
          I'd love it too, Bill.
         But you know that story
         about the paratrooper
         who was afraid to jump.
    And the general asked him
    why he became a paratrooper?
                    The boy said
    "Because I like to be around
    guys who like to jump."
   I guess I'm that way
   about the flight test center.
Yeah.
I know what you mean.
   I'll miss these guys
   around here, all of them.
        Mickey, Linc.
        Specially, Linc.
 There's a big fire burning
 out of control near the dump.
                Tell them to put
                it out, Sweeney.
           Yes, sir.
   But, sir, won't they just
   naturally go ahead and..
    Yes, sir, I'll tell them
    to put it out.
   Connie, I'll tell you how
   much I think of Lincoln Bond.
                He deserves you.
      Now, you'd better get over
      to the hospital, hmm?
Bill, I'm so sorry.
      Look, you don't have
      to worry about me.
Anybody who's waited as long as I have to get married probably knows subconsciously what a rotten husband he'd be anyway.
             Don't give me that!
              I'm tellin' you
              what the man said.
       I'm not responsible
       for the caliber of orders
     that are given around here.
           Under this antiquated
           military system
             they're given to me
             and I pass 'em on.
      Lieutenant Sweeney.
  I'm leaving for Baltimore
  so you'd better get me packed.
           Yes, sir.
  If you're coming along you'd
  better start packing yourself.
  You mean, you want me to go
  along with you, sir?
    Well, let's put it this way.
  After having been
  in the service almost 25 years
         I've run into something
         completely new
               and unheard of
               in the Air Force.
 I don't want to let it get away
 until I find out what it is.
           Yes, sir.
      Something new
      and unheard of, sir?
        A second lieutenant with
        a general for an aid.
That'll finally hit him tonight in bed and he'll go right through the ceiling.
I don't care if that is against regulations.
     It's all your, Mickey.
  Take good care of the place.
I won't say goodbye, Bill.
I know you'll be droppin' in on us to keep your hand in.
     Connie, you take good
     care of Mickey.
        I'll do my best.
       And I'm not saying
       goodbye, either.
     You'll be coming back.
          Sure, sure.
   You see that Linc follows
   Doc Bailey's orders.
  He's not supposed to be out
  of bed for another week.
           What the..
      - Button your coat.
      - I know, I know.
   It was like getting out
   of Alcatraz but I made it.
                          Linc..
      ...when are you gonna
      learn to carry out orders?
  Sorry, general, but I've never
  been able to miss a parade.
           Present..
          Order, hut.
        There goes a lot of guy.
A lot.
   As much as we'll ever see.
Well, almost.
Neal, what do you suppose the missi髇 is?
Send Captain Patterson and his crew in,
Yes, sir.
Go in, please.
Good morning, gentlemen.
Professor Konrad, Captain Patterson,
Lieutenant Cruze, Lieutenant Turner.
How do you do, Professor?
We're honored, sir.
It's a pleasure, gentlemen.
I have a missi髇 for you, Captain.
You're to ferry Professor Konrad to Space Station A.
You're disappointed, Captain?
Missi髇 not important enough for you?
Oh, it isn't that, sir.
Well, anything Professor Konrad does is important.
Space Station A is his brainchild.
He fought for it. He built it.
It's just that, we were hoping for a crack at the exploratory orbit around Mars.
You'll get it.
You and your men have earned the chance.
But this missi髇 is of the gravest importance.
There are indications of serious trouble up there.
Professor Konrad will tell you about it when you're underway.
Until then, you're not even to discuss this with anyone.
Yes, sir.
Departure at 1400.
Your navigational data is being checked out.
Good luck, gentlemen.
At ease.
- Doctor.
- Lieutenant.
Lieutenant. Pleasure, Captain.
A lousy milk run. And we're stuck with it.
Look, we're the guys who made the first orbit around the moon.
We're not ordinary space jockeys.
They got freighters for that routine stuff.
You heard what the Colonel said.
This is a missi髇 of the gravest importance.
What's important about a taxi run to that bus depot up there?
Bus depot?
I'm sorry, sir. I...
No, no, Lieutenant. It's a good name for it.
It is a way station in space, spinning tirelessly 10,000 miles above our Earth, where travelers in space can take on oxygen, fuel, supplies of all kinds for their journeys
- to the far reaches of the universe.
- Yes, sir.
- Welcome aboard, Doctor.
- Thank you, Captain.
Excuse me, sir.
They're still fueling the second stage.
The liquid oxygen. I should know.
I've seen enough of these rockets blow up in my time.
- Departure on time, Captain?
- Yes, we'll be ready.
Our navigation is all preset for us, recorded on tape and fed into our autopilot.
I still want Lieutenant Turner to check it, though.
- Hey, where is that guy?
- Where else?
But, Larry, spaceships are dangerous.
I mean, what if it should get lost up there?
Or blow up or something?
Oh, I wouldn't know what to do without you.
I'm sorry, baby, but I don't have any other choice.
I'm the navigator, and they can't make a move without me.
He's saying goodbye to a friend.
Lieutenant Turner, report to the ship on the double,
Oh, Larry.
On the double, Lieutenant.
So long, honey.
Don't do anything I wouldn't do.
Bye.
Thanks.
That was a pretty dirty trick, if you don't mind my saying so, sir.
Come on. Let's get this show on the road.
Better look over that flight plan again.
Ready, Professor? It's almost takeoff time.
Ready, Captain.
Starfire to Control Room, ready to take off.
Zero plunge,
Twenty, nineteen, eighteen, seventeen, sixteen, fifteen, fourteen, thirteen, twelve, eleven, ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one, fire,
- You all right, Doctor?
- Y es. Y es, I'm all right.
First stage burnout, two seconds late.
Second stage, right on the nose.
We should be on predicted course and speed.
- Good. Verify it with the base.
- Yes, sir.
- Let's take a look at your baby.
- Fine. Fine.
There it is.
Your way station in space.
A few hours cruising, and we'll be there.
How many times have you made this run, Doctor?
100 or more, I should say.
I fought for the idea of a space station for many years, but it wasn't until that memorable day in 1957, when the first satellite was rocketed into space, that I got any support.
22 years ago, July 1963, we put the first materials for the space station into orbit around the Earth.
22 years ago, the first brave men stepped out into space, with 10,000 empty miles beneath them to assemble that material.
Dr. Konrad, the Colonel said there were indications of serious trouble up there.
What did he mean?
They've made some disturbing observations from the space station.
Apparently, we have some deadly neighbors in outer space.
Earth may be in mortal danger.
Captain, there's something strange going on out there.
Some sort of a beam.
What is it?
A beam, a ray.
Energy of some kind, God knows what.
It's gone! It just blew up!
Good men. Good men on her.
Captain, it's coming towards us.
Hang on!
Prepare for maximum acceleration.
It's overtaking us!
It looks like snow.
No, that ain't snow, Mike.
That's 醤gel hair.
We done died and gone to heaven.
Captain.
Give me a hand here, men.
Captain's been hurt.
- His head's cut.
- This must be what hit him when all that stuff was flying around the cabin.
It's a small cut.
There may have been concussi髇.
Where are we?
I was afraid you might ask that, Captain.
Lieutenant Turner here says we're in heaven.
Mr. Cruze doesn't seem to agree.
Myself, I'd vote for Alaska.
Alaska?
It's a bad joke, my boy.
I've no idea where we are.
But first things first.
How do you feel now?
Oh, I'm all right, except for the headache.
Captain, what hit us?
The same thing that blasted the space station, I guess.
It picked us up like a chip of wood in a flash flood.
That it did.
Automatic landing controls must have worked perfectly, or we'd be splattered over 100 acres.
Did you get a report off the base?
No, the radio's knocked out, both transmit and receive.
Captain, are we back on Earth?
Easy enough to find out.
Larry, would you see if the artificial gravity is still working?
- Yeah, it's working.
- Turn it off.
Then we're not on Earth.
I tell you, we're in heaven.
Take a look at that speed indicator.
Over 100 miles a second.
We could have been going twice that fast.
Or 10 times that.
We could be almost anywhere.
What about Mars?
Mars has polar snowcaps.
It also has a surface gravity of 0.38.
We'd all be bouncing around like ping-pong balls.
Why don't we check outside?
I'll break out the pressure suits.
We may not need them.
The gravity is so close to Earth's, the atmosphere should be breathable.
Easy enough to find out.
You're right.
We won't need the pressure suits or the oxygen.
- Got a hunch, Professor?
- Yes, yes, I do.
If it proves to be correct, we will have made the most fantastic voyage in history.
What is it, Doc? Where are we?
Yeah, come on, Doc, give.
I want to be sure.
Captain, I want to explore a bit down there below the snowline.
All right. We'll all go.
About that hunch of yours, Professor, you still got it?
It's no longer a hunch, Captain.
I'm sure.
- We're on the planet Venus.
- What?
At its closest,
Venus is 26 million miles from Earth.
You don't just accidentally land on a planet 26 million miles away.
That's what I would have said, but it appears all things are possible in space.
We don't know how fast we were traveling, nor how long we were unconscious, but of one thing I'm sure, this is Venus.
Yeah, but, Doc, what about all those things we learned at school?
You know, the atmosphere of Venus is supposed to be unbreathable.
The cloud layer's so thick that no light ever gets through.
And with a surface temperature higher than the boiling point of water.
Yes, I know. I subscribe to many of those theories myself.
I even helped formulate some of them.
But it appears
I'm closer to the problem now.
Not a sound.
Not even the hum of an insect.
Is this a dead planet, except for us?
I don't know.
I don't know.
Was that a bird or an animal?
My guess is that was an electronic signal of some kind.
Electronic signal?
Did the hackles cut through the back of my shirt, Mike?
They came up high enough.
Let's get this straight, Doctor.
Electronic signals could only be made by humans.
Not necessarily humans, Neal.
Intelligent beings perhaps, yes, but, who knows what form they may have taken.
It could be insects with tremendous mental powers.
You know, the Doctor's right.
Once I read one of those thriller dollar magazines that told all about the life on the planet Venus.
They had these little bitty guys, about so high.
Green bodies, green blood, heads like king-sized turnips.
They had beautiful eyes, though, waving around on the end of two-foot feelers.
You can see the advantage, Mike.
All they had to do was bend them around behind their head, and they can see what's sneaking up on them.
That sound definitely passed directly over our heads.
Well, there's nothing out there,
I'm happy to report.
I can't stop thinking of Berger and the others on the space station.
All gone.
If one of those weirdies with the floating eyes catches up to us, we'll be gone, too.
You're a cheerful little thing tonight.
Why'd you ever give up that job as master of ceremonies in the Chamber of Horrors?
All right, all right, boys.
- Who'll take the first watch?
- I'll take it.
- I couldn't sleep anyway.
- You got it.
You guys go ahead and sack out.
If I see any of those little green men,
I'll faint.
The sound of my body falling will wake you up.
I wouldn't worry.
The fire ought to keep them away.
How do you know? How do you know?
They might try to come around to get warm.
Just checking. See if you're on your toes.
Good night.
Well, Mike, you've been away from Earth too long.
Hey, you kids play rough.
All right, doll, all right.
- We have found the intruders.
- Good, Bring them in,
We shall do so.
They speak English.
Go! Go! Go!
I believe we'd better accept the invitation.
Yeah, the way those shooting irons of theirs work, I'm with you, Doc.
Well, you heard what the babe said.
Little green men.
I hate them! I hate them!
I hate them! I hate them!
What do you suppose is the matter with her?
I don't know. What's she picking on me for? I didn't do anything.
Go!
- I don't think they like strangers.
- I don't think they like men.
Yeah. Where are the men?
Well, what now?
My guess is they want to look us over.
That's fair enough.
Larry's sure looking them over.
You're not fooling.
How do you like that blonde?
Wow.
Hey, Mike, how'd you like to drag that to the senior prom?
Professor, what do you make of all this?
There's nothing but women.
Perhaps this is a civilization that exists without sex.
You call that civilization?
Frankly, no.
That's the chief?
I am Yllana, ruler of the city of Kadir and queen of this worid.
Why are you here?
We're amazed that you speak our language.
You shouldn't be.
We have monitored your electronic waves for many years.
I see.
I'm Captain Patterson.
This is Professor Konrad,
Lieutenant Turner, Lieutenant Cruze.
We came from Earth on a peaceful missi髇, but our ship was thrown off course, and we crashed here.
This is Venus, is it not?
I believe that is your name for our planet.
If your people will help us repair the damage to our craft, we'll leave as soon as possible.
No, Captain. If we let you go, you will return and make war on us.
That's not true.
The people of Earth have always been aggressive and warlike.
We told you, our missi髇 was a peaceful one.
You betrayed yourselves, Captain.
When my guards found you, your first reaction was to kill.
But we thought we were being attacked.
We were merely defending ourselves.
I do not believe you.
I know how belligerent and quarrelsome you Earthmen are.
The Council will decide your fate.
The men from Earth have had their audience with Yllana.
She sent them to the prison chamber.
- What sort of men are they?
- They seem strong and brave.
Their leader insisted they're on a peaceful missi髇, but Yllana did not believe him.
Do you believe him, Motiya?
His eyes told me he spoke the truth.
I will talk to them.
I must be sure that they can be trusted.
The Council has deliberated.
- lt is our decisi髇 that you lied.
- We told you the truth!
You came here to spy on us, to prepare for invasi髇.
What is the plan of attack?
This is utter nonsense.
There's no plan of attack.
Doctor, you are a man of intelligence.
You must see how futile this stubbornness is.
As a man of science, I assure you,
Earth has never considered Venus to be inhabited, or inhabitable.
Lieutenant Turner?
I haven't heard of any plans.
Why don't you giris knock off all this Gestapo stuff and try to be a little friendly?
You! What have you to say?
Oh, I'm just fine, ma'am.
How's all your folks?
You will die!
But first you will scream for mercy when we force the truth from you.
Take them away!
And I'm the guy that said this was gonna be a lousy milk run.
Very interesting so far.
Be more interesting when we find out what they're going to do with us.
Well, Venus is an awfully nice place to visit, but I certainly wouldn't want to live here.
Not much hope of breaking out.
Surprise one of the guards.
Get a hold of one of those ray guns.
Neal, why do you suppose the queen and her councilors wear those masks?
I'd assume for the same reason that Oriental potentates made their wives wear veils.
Oh, you mean so the hoi polloi can't take a peek.
Something like that.
Brother! They must be knockouts, judging by what there is to see.
Those masked beauties may be knockouts to you, but I have sense of foreboding about them.
A feeling of something monstrous, evil.
So do l.
I didn't say anything to the queen.
I didn't want to put her on guard.
But I'm beginning to think our being here isn't an accident.
I'm afraid I must agree with you.
What's that? What's that?
The ray that destroyed the space station and knocked us off our course may have originated right here.
Oh, come off it.
How could a bunch of women invent a gizmo like that?
Sure, and even if they invented it, how could they aim it?
You know how women drivers are.
I will take that.
Groceries.
Man, they're getting beautifuller and beautifuller.
- The queen wants you to eat.
- Yeah, so we'll eat.
Hey, you know, it's good.
But don't tell me what it is.
Extend our thanks to the queen.
And please ask her to grant us a further discussi髇.
I'm afraid no amount of discussi髇 would help.
Surely, we can make her understand.
But the queen doesn't wish to understand.
She has nothing but hatred in her heart.
Sounds downright subversive.
- Who are you?
- I'm Talleah.
I'm a member of the queen's court.
I came here to tell you that your lives are in great danger.
Maybe I could help.
Fine. We can use a little help, baby.
Hold it. Queen Yllana would kill anyone who tried to help us, wouldn't she?
Yes.
- We can't allow you to risk your life.
- Why not? I'm not alone.
There are many of us who are against the queen's cruelties.
We would like to see her banished.
If you help us, we are going to help you.
I know everything. I heard the verdict.
It's dangerous for you to come here.
I must take that risk and so must you.
Otherwise, the Earth is going to be destroyed.
Earth destroyed? By who?
Yllana and that bunch of masked marvels of hers?
Don't underestimate the queen.
Ten Earth years ago, our worid became involved in war with the planet Mordo.
It was a terrible war.
We fought with weapons of great power, and we still were nearly defeated.
Finally, Mordo was destroyed.
However, the war was won at great cost.
Most of our cities were destroyed, and now they are lost to the jungle.
But what has this to do with Earth?
We suffered greatly.
And that is when we women took over.
Go on.
We were led by a masked woman called Yllana.
Masked? Why?
Nobody seems to know.
You mean, you've never seen her face?
No, but she is said to be very beautiful.
You said Yllana led a revolt?
She said that men caused the ruin of this worid, and it was time for women to take it over.
She became our queen with an absolute power over life and death.
That's incredible.
How did she manage to overthrow the men?
They didn't take her seriously.
They were preparing for war.
After all, she was only a woman.
Well, what happened to them?
To the men.
They're all gone.
You mean, they're all dead?
Not all of them. Some of them she needed.
Scientists, mathematicians.
She banished them to Tyrus, a small satellite that circles Venus.
It became a prison colony.
Then, we're the only men on the whole planet?
Yes.
Wow!
No wonder they locked us up.
Yllana knows that the Earth has been making scientific progress, and she's afraid that they might attack us.
That's why she wants to destroy the Earth.
She must be mad.
She boasts that weapons made by her scientists can destroy the Earth.
The destruction of the space station.
That was the work of one of those weapons?
Yes.
Then Earth may indeed be doomed.
Yeah, if she could knock out the space station the way she did, bam, maybe she could wipe out the Earth.
Yllana sends for you.
I think she wants you, Neal.
Sounds like an invitation to a royal working-over.
- Look, no bunch of dames...
- Turner, don't be a fool.
You heard what that Yllana said she'd do to us?
Yes, I heard what she said.
Also, I watched her.
Believe me, Captain Patterson, she only had eyes for you.
That's it.
Maybe Yllana has more on her mind besides military information.
Neal, why don't you give her the old romance bit?
You know, give her that old black magic.
- Queen Yllana?
- She's a woman, isn't she?
Yes.
Remember the legend of Achilles' heel.
No one, man or woman, is completely invulnerable.
Now listen, skipper, maybe I'm the fellow that ought to have all this romantic razzmatazz.
Sorry, I don't think Yllana's your type.
What do you mean?
If she's a woman, she's my type.
That old stuff again.
How can a doll as cute as that be such a pain in the neck?
All right, Romeo,
I'll give it a whirl if I get the chance.
You know, there's a certain irony in the fact that our lives, and perhaps the lives of everyone on Earth may depend on
Captain Patterson's sex appeal.
If she'd have only picked me.
I'd get her under a tree with a full moon and all that romantic jazz.
Do they have a moon on the planet Venus?
Yes, they have several, but you'll never see them because of the dense cloud cover.
She picked the right guy, don't worry.
I hate her!
I hate that queen!
She's jealous.
26 million miles from Earth, and the little dolls are just the same.
Good evening, Captain Patterson.
Is anything the matter?
Why, no, no.
Bring me a glass of wine, Captain, and one for yourself.
Now, drink with me.
Refreshing, don't you think?
It's distilled from fruits and flowers found nowhere else in the universe.
You're right. It's delicious.
It's exciting and mysterious as Queen Yllana.
I'm sorry my men and l gave the wrong impressi髇, but, a strange new worid, our nerves were on edge.
You needn't bother to explain, Captain.
I understand perfectly.
I hope so. It was scarcely good manners.
You can make your apology sound most convincing.
And, you'll accept it?
Let us say, I'll consider it.
It doesn't depend on your deft phrases and your undeniable charm, Captain, but as I indicated in our first meeting, your common sense.
My common sense?
I mean quite frankly, Captain, if you do not give us a truthful explanation of your visit here, the Council sentence will be carried out to the letter.
I assume you'll weigh the consequences.
But I wonder, have you considered the alternative?
The alternative?
Even a queen can be lonely, Captain.
I've never admitted it until now.
Yllana.
The moment I saw you in the Council chamber,
I felt a weakness most unbecoming to a queen.
But not unbecoming to a lovely woman.
- Take off your mask.
- No.
You're certainly making it difficult.
I can see you are no novice at this, Captain.
Did you promise your men you'd sweep me off my feet?
Use your male magnetism to win freedom for all of you?
Certainly not.
Whatever gave you that idea?
Come, Captain, you don't really hope to deceive me.
We're not fools.
Your space station was an outpost from which you intended to attack us.
How many times must I tell you?
That's not true.
I've warned you, Captain.
You will speak the truth or suffer the consequences.
- What is the plan of attack?
- There is no plan of attack.
Let me show you what happens to those who oppose me.
Look, Captain. The beta disintegrator.
- This is what destroyed the space station.
- Yes.
And it will destroy the Earth just as easily.
But the people, the lives of those countless millions.
I admit the men of Earth have been quarrelsome and foolish in the past, but they mean no harm to your worid.
I swear it.
I understand you better than you do yourself.
You're denying man's love, substituting hatred and a passi髇 for this monstrous power you possess.
Monstrous?
You're not only a queen, you're a woman, too.
And a woman needs a man's love.
Let me see your face.
For that you will die.
I'm sorry, I didn't understand.
Radiation burns. Men did this to me.
Men and their wars.
You say I need the love of a man.
Very well.
Now that you know, will you give me that love, Captain?
- I didn't realize.
- You didn't realize!
Guards! Guards!
It was atomic radiation that disfigured her.
I think it's affected her mind.
And it certainly would account for her hatred of men and wars.
I was clumsy. I should have known.
Don't blame yourself.
No one suspected, not even Talleah.
Just the same, I failed.
It was our last chance.
Well, what are we gonna do, just sit around and wait for those dames to polish us off with the ray guns?
Easy, Mike.
Hey, there's only two of them.
Let's rush them.
- Mike, don't be silly.
- Well, it's better than sitting around, waiting for something to happen.
Come on.
No, No! Friend.
Talleah. Come.
- I was so worried about you.
- We're all right.
These are my friends, Motiya and Kaeel.
They are also your friends.
Hiya, dolls. Glad to have you on our side.
We have no time to waste.
I've found out that the queen plans to destroy the Earth in two days.
Maybe she wasn't bluffing.
Where is the machine?
The beta disintegrator?
It is housed deep in the jungle.
An underground tube runs to it from Kadir, but it is well-guarded.
Then we'll have to go overland.
Can we get out of the city?
It's not going to be easy, but we are going to try it.
Talleah, no need for you and your friends to risk your lives.
It's our fight.
If we can disable the machine, we'll come back to help you.
- But we want to come with you.
- Yes, we want to come with you.
We have no life here without love, children.
All right, you and your friends can come along.
Thank you. Your weapons are here.
We're going to teach you how to use them.
Look in the laboratory.
Take them! Take them! Hide.
Come! Come!
I didn't call for you. What do you want?
You are disturbing my work.
What do you want?
Get out. Get out of here.
You are not needed here.
I ordered, get out!
All exits are sealed.
It's impossible to escape from the palace.
We'll try to fight our way through.
I know a way they may not think of.
Come on.
The Earthmen must be found, and I want them taken alive.
The richest reward to their captors.
No, no, please. No!
This is the traitor who helped the prisoners escape.
No, no, she's mistaken. I swear it, Yllana.
Houdina has always been loyal to her queen.
Release her.
You may go.
It seems
I'm always being forced close to you.
Oh, that's all right.
I'm not the type to complain.
Air Force, you know.
We learn to handle almost any emergency.
Promise you'll stay close to me no matter what happens.
Oh, yes.
Gosh, yes.
Yllana's detection devices are relentless.
Why, they might even track us down by our heartbeats.
Boy, I'm really giving her a target right now.
You're very pretty.
You're handsome.
Is there any special reason for taking your friends along?
Yes, because if we can't change the civilization here,
I thought perhaps we can go someplace and start one on our own.
She's straightforward about it, anyway.
I hope you realize, Captain, this leaves you with a grave responsibility.
Well...
I'm sure that the Captain is dependable in everything.
Looks like we lost them.
I guess we can rest a bit.
They're bombarding us by radar control.
They located us by infrared detection.
Radar can't track us in there.
The metallic streaks on the wall.
You're right, Neal.
No radar impulses can reach us here.
Do you realize that's gold?
The whole planet must be veined with it.
What is so different about gold?
We have much here.
It's incredible.
You know, under other circumstances, this would be so wonderful.
You beside me, watching the fire, the two of us planning the future.
I must admit
I was thinking about the same thing.
But then again, we might have no future at all.
Tell me, Captain, were you happy on your planet?
I was doing work that I liked.
I'd gotten a little recognition.
Yes, I'd say I was pretty content.
Were you really?
No. I hadn't found the girl I wanted, if that's what you're getting at.
I'm glad you said that.
I would be terribly jealous.
Talleah, you're amazing.
Why, you know, on Earth, a girl would rather die than show her real feelings.
We have an old saying,
"A man chases a girl until she catches him."
How silly. What a silly waste of time.
I think if a girl wants a man, she should tell him so.
You're very beautiful, Talleah.
I'm glad you noticed.
It took you such a long time.
I noticed from the first.
And I noticed that I wanted to kiss you from the very beginning.
- Comfortable?
- Yes, very.
- I think the fire's going out.
- No, it isn't.
Oh, the fire.
Larry, get some more wood, will you?
What do you mean,
"Larry, get some more wood"?
What's the matter with,
"Mike, get some more wood"?
This is one time when the seniority really pays off.
Turner, more wood.
Save my place. Yes, sir.
No, I'll get it, Lieutenant.
I'm not busy.
We don't really need any more wood.
Look here!
Guards outside. They found our trail.
No. No use to fight.
They'd simply surround us and starve us out.
They're too many.
How long could we last without food or water?
- You're sure they know we're in here?
- Yes, I'm sure.
- I say let's make a break for it.
- Wait a minute.
- Nobody knows you helped us.
- No.
All right. So far as Yllana's concerned, you're still a loyal subject.
You all are. So loyal, in fact, that you followed us here and recaptured us.
Yes. Of course.
Come on. It has to look good.
March us out.
Come on.
Guards! Help me with the prisoners.
We are going to take the prisoners back to Kadir.
Talleah has recaptured the Earthmen.
We shall return with them immediately.
Talleah has recaptured the fugitives,
Good. Have them taken to my quarters.
Push forward the preparations with all possible speed.
Guards will remain here.
Man, I just aged 10 years out there.
What if those guards had insisted on coming in here with us?
Nice going, Talleah.
I'm disappointed in you, Captain, attempting this foolhardy escape.
You should have known it would be impossible.
Perhaps you would have been more disappointed if I hadn't tried.
Perhaps.
But you'll never get another chance,
I assure you.
I am going to allow myself the exquisite pleasure of watching you while I obliterate the Earth.
Then you will be executed.
Well done, Talleah.
I promised a rich reward for the captor, and you shall have it.
I don't want your reward.
One move, and I kill you.
You're all through. You've had it.
Traitors! You know what this means.
Freedom for our people.
These women aren't alone.
There are thousands like them, desperately wishing for the old order.
And now they're going to have it.
My subjects are grateful to me.
I've kept peace.
Peace is not enough.
They must also be content.
- Women can't be happy without men.
- You're so right, baby.
Do you want to be hated, Yllana?
I don't think you're a tyrant.
I think you're just a woman who's been hurt, hurt so badly you can never repay it.
Is that understanding, Captain, or pity?
Call it what you want.
I'm giving you a chance to save your life.
First, you'll go to that tele-viewer screen of yours and give orders to suspend all work on the beta disintegrator.
I'll give no such orders.
And you will contact the guards on Tyrus and tell them to free all the men.
And if I refuse, Captain?
The alternative wouldn't be a pleasant one.
No, I suppose not.
I've shown no mercy.
I should expect none.
That was a stupid thing to do, Yllana!
You ought to know when you're beaten.
Beaten? You're beaten, Captain.
No one but I can give the orders you want, and I'll die before I give them!
You know, Neal, it sounds like she means it.
That's great, just great!
Is it true?
The orders must come from Yllana?
Yes.
And the orders are going to come from Yllana.
Of course.
I'm going to put on one of her dresses.
Come on, giris. Help me.
I'm sorry.
- We could have ruled this planet together.
- Not your way, Yllana.
You would have done so if I had been as beautiful as Talleah.
- Once I was beautiful.
- Yes. I'm sure you were.
- Tie her up!
- Let me go!
- Put her in back of that screen.
- lt'll be a pleasure.
Let me go!
You're hurting me. Let me go!
Let me go!
You're hurting me. Let me go!
You'll pay for this. You'll all pay!
You look like her twin sister.
Disguised like that, you can take us right to the machine, give us our chance to destroy it.
Are any of the personnel at the disintegrator base loyal to you?
-10 or even more.
- We'll need them.
You better go ahead and tell them that we are coming.
Alert them to help us if necessary.
We'll do our best.
No, that way.
We may not have a chance to talk later.
We may not even live through the day.
I just want to say while I have the chance,
I love you.
Love. I've almost forgotten, but if it is that warm feeling that makes my heart sing, then l, too, love you.
We must hurry. We have no time to lose.
Don't forget. We're your prisoners.
Get rid of those guns.
Yllana!
Get out! I didn't send for you.
What are you looking for?
You're disturbing me.
Traitor.
Now don't jump to conclusions.
Please!
Now, if you'll just give me a second
- I can explain.
- Silence, man.
So, the beautiful, loyal Talleah.
- Let me kill her now.
- No, not yet.
They shall die. Talleah, Motiya, all of them, but not until they've witnessed my greatest triumph.
For her treachery, Talleah will die last, and most horribly of all.
I could spare your life.
I must say, this baby looks like it can do it.
Yes.
I believe they've solved the problem of projecting nuclear energy.
You will be interested to hear that the weapon will be ready to fire in a few minutes.
Well, Captain, no comments?
I think you're out of your mind.
A person like you must appreciate this achievement, Professor.
One touch of a tiny red button, and Earth will become a wasteland, and the mountains will crumble into dust.
It's monstrous.
Will nothing keep you from going through with this?
Nothing, Professor!
You disappoint me.
I thought you would be fascinated.
Many would envy you this privilege,
Professor.
If you've got a crazy notion to blast somebody, blast us.
In due time, Lieutenant. In due time.
Look! Over there!
My electronic telescope makes every detail clear.
It took untold millions of years to create the planet you call Earth.
Watch it closely, Earthmen.
It will be destroyed in a matter of seconds.
Watch it!
And now the brave men who have helped us to get back our freedom and our happiness are about to depart.
Their ship has been repaired, and there is nothing that stands in their way to go back to their own planet.
If you must go, promise me you're going to come back to me.
I don't want to go, Talleah, believe me.
I want to stay here with you.
But, Larry, you said you loved me.
Oh, baby, I do, I do.
These past few days have been wonderful.
I mean, getting to know you and all.
Can't you delay your departure a day or two?
I'm sorry. No.
- Where's Larry?
- Where else?
Larry.
I gotta go. I'll be back as soon as I can.
- I was just being polite to the girl.
- Sure, sure.
Come on. We have to get going.
You're going to come back to me.
The electronic tele-viewer is working.
Earth answers us.
Wonderful!
My orders to Captain Patterson are not to attempt a return flight in the Starfire.
I will not risk his life or the lives ofhis men in a patched-up ship,

Pepe! Is it your desire that the fishes, they swim away?
Come on! Pull up on the net!
Fishnets.
Many big ropes to catch a little fish.
Now, in Texas, that's where one little rope, she catches a big cow!
The net, the net.
Texas.
- What is that?
- Mondello, you do not know of Texas?
She is a big country across the sea, near America.
- That's where the cowboys...
- Silenzio!
Look!
- We go back.
- Why, Verrico?
It is a possibility that in the aircraft there may be people.
But, Verrico, that is no usual aircraft.
There are no people on it.
Mondello, you know this thing you say?
You were perhaps inside of it?
What are we? Children or men of the sea?
- We go back.
- We go back!
Look, a hole.
Pepe, the boat hook!
Mondello, you come with me.
I may need your help.
Why me, Verrico? Why me?
Do you not boast to be the bravest man in all Sicily? Come on!
- This man, he still lives.
- Take him to the boat, quickly.
Take him.
Bring him.
- Row, row, Pepe. It's dangerous here.
- Verrico!
- There may be other people inside.
- Never mind the others! Save yourself!
The oars.
There must be more than two men in there.
Almost certainly, Pepe, but we could not reach them.
May they rest in peace.
From all indications, she's splashed in somewhere right here.
Twenty thousand leagues under the sea.
Perhaps not, General.
Calder may have regained control.
I appreciate your optimism, Doctor, but that's the way it reads.
We got a radar blip on her just off Iceland.
Altitude, 200 miles.
Rate of descent, what was it?
Thirty-five hundred feet per minute, sir.
Another sighting by Stillman from Marseilles.
Rate of descent, still 3,500 feet per minute.
I'm sorry, Doctor.
That puts her right down with the fish.
What makes me sick inside is that they were so close, so very close.
They made it there, and almost made it back.
Major Stacey speaking.
Hold it. Tell the General.
McIntosh. Yes?
Where? Is that confirmed?
Thank you. She's down off Sicily, Doctor.
Only a few kilometers off the coast of a fishing village named Gerra.
- Where is it? Gerra...
- There it is, right there.
We'll need the cooperation of the Italians, so get the State Department on the phone.
Tell them we've got a green light, and get the Italian embassy to clear a path.
Tell them to roll up the red tape and put it in a drawer until this thing is over.
- Yes, sir.
- After that, call Transport.
Tell them the Doctor and I are leaving now for Sicily.
Yes, sir.
Take them to the Comune di Gerra, quickly.
Mondello, get a doctor, subito.
Verrico, you were inside the wreck.
Were only those two men aboard?
No, I was inside with Mondello.
We saw one more man but it was a certainty he was dead.
But, signor commissario, the ship of the air, she was so big, so vast.
Surely there must have been other men inside, too.
I want you to remember everything that happened, and tell me about it slowly.
The doctor is not at home.
He's at Signora Martinelli's who's to have a bambino.
Perhaps twins, as before. Who knows?
- And Signor Martinelli is a very sick man.
- That's too bad.
There is that doctor from Rome, traveling with his American granddaughter.
- Is he still here?
- The man with the house on the wheels?
Pepe would know. Pepe!
Pepe sells him worthless shellfish, anything of no value.
Si, Verrico, you have need for me?
That old dottore from Rome, do you know where he is?
Dr. Leonardo?
He is camped on via Messina, a kilometer from the residence of Signor Groppi.
- Good. You know where the place is?
- Of course.
Get the doctor here at once.
Dr. Leonardo!
Come with me, please. Come, now.
A great aircraft fell into the sea.
It's a terrible tragedy.
Two men, they need you.
Slowly, slowly, my friend. Do I understand there's been an air crash and men are hurt?
The only doctor we have is with Signora Martinelli who's having twins, perhaps more.
Who knows?
But I'm afraid I wouldn't be of any help.
I'm a doctor in zoology, not medicine.
But my granddaughter, it is possible, Marisa.
- You are a doctor of people with hurts?
- Not yet. Not for another year.
I'll do the best I can.
Come this way.
Be back as soon as I can, Grandpa.
Good afternoon, my merchant friend.
And what is it you wish to sell me today at an exorbitant rate, I'm certain?
An inedible clam which you're willing to part with for very little money, I'm sure.
Dr. Leonardo.
You are a kind man. A just man.
A man of much learning.
A man of great wealth.
A man of wealth, a professor of...
Of course, Pepe. Come on in, my Sicilian bandit, and we'll bargain.
You have 200 lire?
There's a possibility that I have such a fortune.
Tell me, let me see this great treasure of such great value.
- You have 200 lire with you, in your purse?
- Yes.
- That is a true fact?
- Sure, that is a true fact.
But, tell me, why is your need so great and so urgent?
Because with the 200 lire,
I can purchase the hat from Texas.
Please, may I have my money now?
A hat from Texas?
I don't understand you, Pepe.
It is the hat the cowboys wear when they shoot the bandito.
- And the man, he is dead.
- Those American movies.
For so great a need, Pepe, you deserve the 200 lire.
Now, let me see. What you got?
Hey, I'd better get my money's worth or I'm coming after you, believe me.
Pepe!
- Si, Doctor?
- Where did you find that thing?
In the water, Doctor. In the sea.
I know. You want to know where you are.
In Gerra.
Gerra?
A village in southern Sicily.
About where we figured.
The others, how are they?
Well, as far as I know, your aircraft is at the bottom of the sea.
Whoever else was on it...
Except for this man.
His condition is critical.
I'm sorry, but you're in no condition to get out of bed.
- Doctor! Dr. Sharman!
- I must ask you to leave this man alone!
- Please. Dr. Sharman!
- He's extremely ill.
- Can you hear me?
- Go back to your bed.
- Nurse, I'm in no mood to argue with you.
- I'm not a nurse!
I'm a doctor, or almost a doctor, and this man may be dying.
All right, "almost-a-doctor."
Do you know what's wrong with him?
- No, not exactly.
- Well, I do. And I know it's fatal.
Eight of my crew have already died from it.
If you must stay, stand still and be quiet.
- Dr. Sharman! Can you hear me?
- Will you please lie down?
- Are we going to make it? Make it back?
- We are back. We are back!
- You're suffering from exhaustion.
- Quiet!
The animal specimen.
- Is it all right?
- I don't know.
We crashed into the Mediterranean, and I guess it went down with the wreck.
The others are dead.
Make them find it.
My notes.
- Will you lie down?
- Nurse!
Doctor, how long can it live encased in that metal cylinder?
I've got to know. It's our only hope.
...cooperative, informative. Altogether, a joy and a pleasure to be around.
Now, what specimen? What fatal disease?
Would you mind telling me what this is all about?
I'm sorry.
I mean it.
- But I can't.
- Can't or won't?
Both.
He's dead.
I know.
You better get some sleep.
Pleasant dreams.
Grandpa.
Grandpa!
What is it, mia cara?
- My gloves. Where are my gloves?
- Under the table.
What is it? Where did it come from?
Pepe, the little fisher-boy.
I've never seen anything like this before.
There is no scientific record of such a creature.
Look at the torso.
The torso is that of a human being.
And the articulation of the legs. Look at it.
But from where?
The cage. The cage, Marisa.
Soft cloth. The flooring of the cage is rough and hard.
So very ugly, and yet it seems so frightened.
Come inside, mia cara.
Marisa, come.
What is it, Grandpa?
Come here. Come here.
Observe, mia cara.
Observe our strange friend.
- Look how much he's grown in a few hours.
- It's unbelievable.
Think, Marisa.
Think of what will be said when I bring this strange creature to the giardino zoologico in Rome.
Now I'm going to the village, and I'm going to see the young fisher-boy and learn where in the sea he found our friend.
Can you inform me of the whereabouts of Pepe?
Pepe? He's right over here playing like a Texas cowboy.
Where?
He is gone.
Yet he was here a few moments ago.
I will see him tonight, and I'll tell him to seek you tomorrow.
No, tomorrow I won't be here.
I'm just now on my way to Rome.
Welcome to Gerra.
May I introduce myself, General?
- I am Signor Unte, commissario of police.
- Thank you. This is Dr. Uhl.
- It's a pleasure.
- How do you do, sir?
From the government in Rome, I received a telegram. I am to cooperate with you.
I'm at your service, signore.
If you will come with me,
I will take you to Colonel Calder.
He's not badly hurt?
No, General, don't you worry.
He recovers quickly.
It was all I could do to keep him from coming to meet you himself.
This way, please.
Congratulations, Bob! You made it!
- First man in all history. How does it feel?
- Fine, sir, except that...
Yes, I know.
It's tragic the others died in the moment of their glory.
But still, and I mean it, you deserve congratulations.
Mine, too, Bob.
You did a magnificent, heroic job.
- Is there some place we can talk privately?
- My office is yours. This way, please.
I am honored, signore.
May I introduce Signor Contino from the Italian Department of State?
General McIntosh.
Colonel Calder. Dr. Uhl.
How do you do, sir?
Thank you for coming so promptly, signore.
And I want to thank your government for expressing its desire to cooperate.
I must beg you, however, for the moment, to observe strict secrecy.
It is understood.
What I have to say, you will find incredible but true.
Colonel Calder here has just returned from an expedition to Venus.
To Venice? Perhaps you mean "Venezia"?
To Venus. The planet Venus.
- The planet Venus?
- That is correct.
I was informed this matter was connected with something vast, but the planet Venus?
Man's first interplanetary voyage.
On the return trip, the spaceship was crippled by a meteor.
Except for Colonel Calder here, the entire crew perished.
- I am grieved.
- The problem that confronts us is this,
Venus' atmosphere is such that a human can't breathe and survive for long even after using what we considered foolproof respiratory equipment.
Several members of the expedition died before the others realized the danger.
Dr. Sharman, the chief scientist, also became fatally ill.
He died here, after the ship crashed.
Fascinating. Horrible, but fascinating.
Now, on that ship was a particular sealed metal container.
In it is an unborn specimen of animal life on the planet. We've got to find it.
Our task is to discover in what way life is able to survive and flourish there.
Not until that secret is learned can another expedition return.
And return we must, for on Venus important minerals were discovered that would be of vast benefit to our civilization.
I am at your disposal, General.
In what way may I assist you?
We need several divers to descend to the wreck to search for the specimen.
They will be here in the morning.
- Don't you want me to drive for a while?
- No, no. Non sono stanco, grazie.
I should like to speak to the two fishermen who went aboard the wreck.
Of course. I have them waiting here.
Now, if you will come with me, please.
Verrico, Mondello, one moment of your time, please.
This is Verrico and this is Mondello.
They are the two men who went inside the ship before she sank.
The American general wishes to speak to you of an item of great importance.
We are looking for a cylinder... about this high and about this round.
Probably, it went down with the ship, but there's the possibility it was knocked loose and may drift ashore somewhere today, tomorrow, who knows?
It is so important that we recover this container and its contents that I have offered the reward of a half million lire.
Please spread that information...
- You will not take my hat?
- Silenzio, Pepe. The General is speaking.
- Continue, General.
- Wait!
What is it? What is it you wish to say?
If I speak of the thing from the ship then you must promise me that I may keep my hat from the great country of Texas.
Of course, you may keep your hat.
What do you know about the container?
And there is the matter of a half million lire.
How much is that?
Sufficient to purchase for me a cowboy horse like they ride in Texas?
Enough to buy many horses.
What do you know about the container?
You promise to me about the hat, about the horses?
You have my promise, son.
It is there.
Come on, follow me.
- Please, may I have my horse?
- Empty.
I know where it is. The thing from inside.
Where is it?
I took it to Professor Leonardo and sold it to him for 200 lire.
- That's how I have the hat from Texas.
- Professor Leonardo, where is he?
He must be somewhere on the road to Messina.
He said he was going to Rome.
How will we find him?
How will we know him?
He drives a truck with a house that follows like a goat.
A trailer.
Find it quickly. I'll wait here for the divers.
Yes, sir. Come on.
- Would you accompany the Colonel?
- Of course, General.
Besides, I have to see a man about a horse and a half million lire.
- What?
- The canvas has come loose.
I'd better stop then.
You know, it occurs to me that our friend is perhaps a mutation, but of what species, I do not know.
Now, here, you catch this on the other side.
There's also the possibility that it might be a type of throwback toward the prehistoric and unknown.
Are you hurt?
No, I don't think so.
I guess I frightened it as much as it frightened me.
But its claw was so strangely hot.
I beg your pardon, but you must be...
- A strange animal has escaped.
- Like something you've never seen?
Like something no one has seen before.
It broke out of its cage and grabbed me by the arm.
Hello, "almost-a-doctor."
This creature, tell me about it.
Well, first it was this high.
Then this high.
Now it is tall, nearly as tall as a man.
Is that the normal rate of growth?
No, not as far as I know.
The only data we have is in Dr. Sharman's notes.
- Where's the animal now?
- It fled into the woods.
Let's go.
Wait. What is that creature?
Where does it come from?
I must know. We will go with you.
I'm sorry, Professor. I can't now.
Thanks for your help.
It looks as though my patient has fully recovered.
Carlo!
What you got, boy?
Don't move!
Stay where you are.
Let's back out quietly.
Incredible!
The creature has to be taken alive.
There's a cart outside.
Would you have your men bring it in the barn?
Now, will you get me a long wooden pole?
I've had nightmares in my time, but
I've never dreamed of anything like this.
Actually, they're not ferocious unless provoked.
That poor dog must have jumped him first.
That's good.
That's just what I need. Grazie.
Now, I'm going to try and prod the creature right into that cart.
If I can get him in there, be ready to shut that gate.
Come on down, fellow. Jump!
Come on.
Come on down. Come on.
Come on!
Get back!
Look out!
No! Stop him!
All right, men, over this way.
I don't like it.
- Colonel?
- Yeah.
I hate to intrude on your private thoughts, but I'd like to change your bandage.
You're worried about what happened today about where the creature is tonight, aren't you?
We'll find him. We've got to.
I guess I've been pretty inconsiderate and self-centered.
You've had a lot on your mind.
If that's an apology,
I think it went in the wrong direction.
All you've done is try to help and all I've done is snarl at you.
I hope, when this is all over, you'll let me try to make it up to you over a table for two in a dark café.
With a candle burning on the table?
And a bottle of wine.
- Bob. Bob Calder!
- Excuse me.
Here's something, Bob.
Sharman wrote that the basic diet of the creatures is raw sulfur.
- I remember that.
- There are rich sulfur beds in Sicily.
Not many kilometers from here, at the base of Mount Etna.
We'll scour the mountains at first light.
If the creature's there, we'll recapture it.
I would consider it an honor to offer the facilities of the giardino zoologico in Rome for its observation and examination.
That will not be necessary, gentlemen.
There is no longer an attempt to recapture the monster alive.
I don't understand.
I must inform you, signore, there is no more cooperation between us.
The beast must be destroyed!
It has injured one man badly, and he might kill others.
My duty is to the welfare of my people.
Not this crazy scientific experiment!
Signor commissario, you can't do that!
Signor commissario, please wait.
That is my position.
The safety of the people in this district is my affair, my primary affair.
As long as I am commissario.
It may be, you can have me replaced.
That, of course, is your privilege.
Until then,
I intend to function as commissario.
You are an efficient man, signor.
A man of sincerity.
There will be no thought of replacing you.
Then I must say that at daybreak,
I intend to use all means at my disposal to destroy that creature before it kills someone.
But you can't do that.
Yes, sir.
May I remind you that the commissario is a Sicilian police chief performing his duties?
I know that, sir, but...
But what?
Would there be any objection if Dr. Uhl and I tried to track it and take it alive?
- Before the commissario has him killed?
- Not from me. Signor Contino?
How do you propose to do this?
On Venus, we discovered by accident that these creatures are susceptible to electric shock, and that controlled voltage can paralyze them.
If we could have two helicopters and a squad of armed paratroopers we might be able to drop a charged wire net on the beast.
A net!
All I ask, sir, is permission to try.
If this can be done before any human life is threatened the Italian government will have no objection.
- Bob, you'll have your copters.
- Thank you, sir.
Thank you, signore.
- The hook is working fine, sir.
- That's good, Sergeant.
Take those sacks of sulfur over to the other copter.
We're taking over a load of sulfur to feed our prisoner when we capture him.
If the commissario doesn't catch it first.
Doc, this is like a parachute.
It's got to work the first time.
Right.
All right, men. Load up. Let's go.
Let's use the back road. There's a waterfall.
We've spotted the animal, it's by those sulfur beds.
Right.
We can't drop the net until it's cleared.
I'll drop the sulfur now.
It's taking the bait. We're ready to move.
Okay, we'll stand by.
Another few feet and you've got it.
Drop it!
Hurry it up!
Careful.
We're ready, Doc.
Jump clear.
Hit it!
Maples here.
No, John, nothing's happened yet.
Yes, I will.
If you will all come in, please, the General will see you now.
It looks like something now.
Keep a line open.
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen of the press.
I am fully aware of the rumors that began with an air crash ten days ago off the coast of Sicily.
Not until now have I received permission to make known the facts exactly as they are.
This cablegram has been signed by the United States Secretary of Defense.
"In the face of widespread speculation, and after consultation
"with governments, the President has authorized release of all information
"to press and news agencies for their immediate publication.
"The airship XY-21, which crashed into the Mediterranean Sea on the 11th
"was a single-stage, astro-propelled rocket launched 13 months ago
"from a site within the United States.
"The rocket, with its complement of 17 men,
"had landed on the planet Venus..."
- Venus?
- The planet Venus?
"...had landed on the planet Venus and was on the return to Earth when the ship
"plunged into the sea."
There was one survivor:
Colonel Calder, seated beside me.
Commander of the expedition.
Some of you may have heard the story of a monster now confined in Rome's zoo.
That beast is from Venus.
It is an essential object of scientific study if man is to survive the atmosphere on Venus, poisonous to humans.
May we be allowed to see this creature?
I ask you to select three of your number to accompany Colonel Calder to the zoo.
Those selected by you will, of course, pool their interviews with the entire press corps and we will furnish you all necessary photos.
Well, I guess that's all, and thank you for your patience.
Sorry, old boy, my line.
John, get this...
The size!
Eight days ago, it was about this tall.
How do you account for its rate of growth?
Or is that normal on Venus?
No, it isn't. The scientists here believe the Earth's atmosphere has upset its metabolic rate.
The more it breathes, the more tissue it builds, the bigger it gets.
If you'll follow me, please.
You've probably heard of Dr. Gerhart Blankfurt of Vienna.
Probably the world's top man in anesthesia.
It's the doctor's job to keep the creature unconscious during the examination.
Now, you'll note the wire running down to the creature's wrist.
Dr. Blankfurt keeps 1,800 volts of electricity coursing through the body.
More voltage and it would die.
Less, it would awaken.
Amazing. Utterly amazing.
You can get a better look at the wrist connection this way.
This is Dr. Koroku of the University of Tokyo.
He's assisting Dr. Uhl.
Another attempt to pry secrets from the creature, Doctor?
We hope this electro-dynamometer will enable us to complete our examination of the oral passages.
Could you give us any positive statement on your progress so far, Doctor?
So far, we have come to one conclusion.
The creature's olfactory system is more highly developed than any known on this planet.
We'll find Dr. Uhl on the platform.
He's the man in charge.
Sixty-seven cc's. Correct?
They're feeding the creature a compound of sulfur.
Now, sulfur serves it as our vitamins do us.
- Grandpa, will you need me anymore?
- No.
You caught me unprepared.
I've been cooking over a hot creature all day.
You get lovelier every time I see you.
Or is it the lights in this room?
Well, next to that, I look dandy.
Colonel, when you have a free moment
I'd like to tell you about the latest nightmare I've had.
They're busy for the moment, tell me now.
Well... it concerns a dark café a small table, a bottle of wine.
And a burning candle?
And that candle's burning lower and lower.
Pretty soon it's going to burn out.
Well, maybe if we hurry, we can find that dark café before it's too late.
Good.
- Now, don't go away.
- I won't.
If you'll come over here, please.
Dr. Uhl is expecting you.
Dr. Uhl, I present Miss Reynolds,
United Press. Mr. Maples of Reuters.
- This is Monsieur Lacroix, News France.
- How do you do?
General McIntosh has told us the importance of knowing how this animal survives on Venus.
We discovered the creature's respiratory system includes sort of a fibrous filtering element which blocks out all of the poisonous vapors on Venus.
Fortunately, we've been able to duplicate that system almost exactly.
It's like a plastic sponge.
It is made of one of the new synthetics.
By the way, there's a rumor that gunfire has no effect on the beast. Why?
This beast has no heart and it has no lungs.
It has instead a network of small tubes throughout its entire body.
Hence, firearms effect no great damage.
Yes, Lee?
Dynamometer is coming on the platform now.
Please, right over here.
Look out for those electric cables!
Look out!
Everybody, off the platform!
Come on, Doc, hurry!
- Get that power back on!
- This way, Colonel.
- The power is gone.
- Everyone, outside! Fast!
Marisa!
Look!
Get that elephant out of there!
Get these people out of here!
- Where's the nearest phone?
- There, Colonel.
Yes, sir. And, General, we need some firepower, quick!
All right. As soon as I do, I'll get there.
Stay with the beast, but get reports back to me if you can.
Right, sir.
The creature?
On the rampage! If it isn't stopped, it'll kill hundreds, maybe thousands!
We'll need artillery and tanks immediately.
- It's up one of the side streets.
- I know. I hear it.
Doc, take them to the embassy.
- I'm going to track it as long as I can.
- Right.
This is Colonel Calder, get me
General McIntosh. This is an emergency.
It disappeared into the Tiber at Ponte Umberto.
What do you think, would hand grenades force it out?
I don't know. I can't tell what it'll do or where it'll do it. It's worth a try.
There's an artillery unit deployed at...
The Palace of Justice across the bridge.
They'll give you all the help you need.
Start blasting it, Bob.
We're moving up with another unit, on the other section of the Tiber.
Yes, sir.
It's got to be down there someplace.
Keep blasting.
- Calder talking.
- Anything there, Bob?
No, we don't spot it here.
Nothing here, either.
We've blasted the Tiber through the city for hours. Any ideas?
Hello, Bob.
Do you hear me?
Do you hear me, Bob? Come in, Bob.
It's here at Ponte Sant'Angelo!
Ponte Sant'Angelo.
Bob!
It's headed towards the Colosseum.
Sergeant, deploy your men.
Sergeant!
Sergeant, take your men up those stairs.
Up here!
There it is.
Look!
Why is it always so costly for man to move from the present to the future?

Come in, Mrs. Sugrue.
Katie, darlin'.
Can you lend me the loan of a small pinch of tea?
I'll pay you back Thursday.
You can have it and welcome.
I knew you wouldn't refuse old Sheelah, and I knew you'd have rations and leavings, for there's little that's lacking here, unless 'twould be a man to cook for.
I have me father to cook for.
So you do, so you do, but I meant a man of your own.
- Time enough for that.
- "Time enough" lost the ducks.
There's many a lass that lost her market from waiting too long.
Oh, you can smile now, but who in this town would have you?
- Am I that bad?
- You miss the meaning.
There's not a man doesn't want you, but who among them dare look at you with the grand house you live in?
A fine situation your father has with his lordship.
Take my son Pony.
He don't dare raise his eyes to you, and him the catch of the town.
Now, I would have said that Pony thought no small beer of himself.
Oh, he's proud.
He's proud as a white-washed pig, but he needs encouragement from you.
You should be looking ahead, Katie.
Your father is getting no younger, and when the time comes that he must step down... who else will there be but Pony
Sugrue who can take his place?
Don't put me father in his grave just yet.
Oh, the saints forbid.
He'll be spared for many years,
God willin'.
[Skipped item nr. 32]
(hoofbeats)
That must be Pony now.
No, it's not.
Merciful heavens!
It's Lord Fitzpatrick himself.
Hello, Katie.
Your Lordship, why didn't you tell us you were coming?
I'd have opened the manor house for you.
I'll not be stopping here long enough for that.
Where's your father?
Well, now, let me see.
Um...
I heard him sayin', um, something about cuttin' the weeds around the summer house.
I think he'll have gone to have the smithy sharpen his scythe.
- I'll fetch him for you, Your Lordship.
- Well, that's good of you.
That Katie's a grand girl.
Almost makes up for her father.
- What ails him?
- Oh, nothing at all, but he retired about five years ago, didn't tell me about it.
He'll be down at the inn now, telling stories.
Well, let's go and have a look at the gatehouse.
Oh, I didn't know anybody was here.
I'm the Widow Sugrue,
Your Lordship.
- I often comes in to help.
- I see.
Begging Your Lordship's pardon,
I'm the mother of Pony Sugrue.
He drives the mail cart to Cahersiveen whenever the train comes in.
I'm very glad to hear it.
He's a fine strong lad.
He's worthy of greater things.
- Is he, now?
- Aye, he is indeed.
You'll never hear me speak a word against Darby O'Gill, but he's gettin' on.
When the time comes for you to hire a younger man, give a thought to m'lad Pony.
I'm not sure I want a man who is too well known to the town.
A man from outside would be more respected.
My Pony is respected and feared, too.
He's whipped every man in the parish.
Is that so?
Thank you. Thank you.
If it were Pony you had in charge of this place, he wouldn't let it fall to wrack and ruin whilst he sat in the pub telling stories.
Well, I'll tell you, the first look
I got at him was in the old ruins
- on the top of Knocknasheega.
- And what did he look like, Darby?
Ah, just like any other leprechaun, only he, being king of them all, had a little gold crown on his head.
Tell me something, Darby.
Did he have a long tail and a cloven hoof?
Now, whoever heard of a leprechaun havin' a...
(laughter)
You don't have to listen if you don't want to, Pony, but you needn't make fun of those who do.
But I do.
I want to listen.
I want to learn all about them.
Here, Molly, give me another large one, and then maybe I can see a leprechaun, too.
You'll get no more whiskey here today, but if you care to be sociable, you can have a glass of stout.
I ordered whiskey, and devil a foot will I stir from here until I get it.
Pony Sugrue, you're bloom old and for want of a beatin', and if I were 10 years younger,
I'd give it to you.
Ah, but you're... you're not
10 years younger, are you?
No, I'm not, but this is my place, and while you're in the Rathcullen
Arms, you'll sit quietly, or I'll have Father Murphy forbid you to come here at all.
All right, I'll have the stout.
You were sayin', Darby?
I was sayin' this wasn't like any old leprechaun that you wouldn't say hello twice to.
But who was he... but Brian Connors himself, the king of them all.
But I got me eye fixed on him.
They can't escape, you know, as long as you don't look away.
Now, the night was dark and the mountain was covered with mist, and the moon was no bigger than the light from a wee penny candle, but it didn't hide him from me... for there he stood, with an angry little gob on him and his face as fierce as fire.
King Brian, me old boyo,
I've got you at last, and I'm not gonna let you go until you grant me the favor of three grand wishes.
Wait now, wait now, maybe we can talk this over.
- Will you have a pinch of snuff?
- Aye, and you'll blow it into me eyes.
I'm up to all your dirty little tricks.
You've gone too far. You'll get no wishes from me at all, now.
You'll either give them to me, or else you'll answer to the Church.
I'll have Father Murphy curse you with a blessin' that'll shrivel you up in a minute.
All right, then, wish your wishes and be done with it.
I've work to do at home.
- Ah, don't rush me.
- Don't rush you? Huh.
Mean to say you're not gonna wish for a crock of gold?
I may in due time, but what's gold to a man if he be too sick or too sad to enjoy it?
Ah, you're the thinkin' man.
I am, and me first wish is you'll grant me health.
- Granted.
- Now, me second wish is a small wish indeed, but it means a lot to me.
- I want a big crop of potatoes.
- Granted.
And me third wish is for the crock of gold.
Granted.
Now, what about your fourth wish?
Me fourth wish?
Try me.
You'll find I'm a generous man.
Then I'll be a generous man.
I'd like a crock of gold like this for me good friend Tom Kerrigan and another one for that decent man Pat Scanlon and another one for that doorful of a woman, Molly Malloy.
- Is that your fourth wish?
- It is.
(laughing)
Three wishes I'll grant you, great wishes or small, but you'll wish a fourth one, and you'll lose them all!
(laughing)
Wasn't I the fool of the world, lettin' him trick me into the fourth wish, and me knowin' better.
Ah, dear, dear, and we could all have been as rich as Midas himself.
- A whole crock of gold for me.
- The devil's gold.
I wouldn't touch it if Father Murphy blessed every coin.
Stay away from Knocknasheega, Darby.
You moil and meddle with that little king, he'll put the come-hither on you and make you his slave forevermore.
Do you think I'm a babe in arms?
You are to the likes of him.
5,000 years old, he is, and every year of his life he's learned a new trick.
And I've learned 100 of them.
You're mad, mind you. You'll be caught like a rat in a snap trap.
Now, I don't want your blood on my head, so don't wish any gold for me.
I'll leave your share to the Church, Paddy,
(laughs) but I won't let Father Murphy know where I got it.
- No, no.
- (laughter)
(Father Murphy)
God save all here.
We didn't see you, Father.
I didn't want to interrupt.
I just dropped in to tell you the news.
My friend Father O'Leary in the town of Glencove has a new bell that was given to him by Lord Bellinbergh, and he has presented the old one to us.
- Ah, that's grand, Father.
- Glory be.
There'll be a chapel bell in our tower at last.
All we have to do is to go after it.
Now, if I had a horse, which I haven't,
I'd go for it meself, which I won't, but I thought perhaps there might be somebody here with a horse and cart who'd like to go for the bell.
How much would that somebody be paid, Father?
Paid?
I suppose we might be able to scratch up two pounds.
Now, I would've said it was worth two pounds, 10, if it was worth a bob.
Like enough it's worth three pounds, but since we're a poor parish,
I thought perhaps you might like to take out the difference in the credit to your soul.
Two pounds, 10, Father.
Why, my goodness me, a deed like that might even absolve a man from the sin of using the priest and the Church against the powers of darkness for his own selfish ends.
I'll do it, Father.
I'll do it for nothing.
No. As a reward, you may have the music of the bell.
- The music of the bell for me?
- Yes, and for your seed, breed and generation till the end of time.
It's a bargain, Father.
I'll do it in the morning.
Father!
Savin' your presence, Father Murphy, but he's needed at the house.
Excuse me, Your Reverence.
- Fitzpatrick himself...
- Don't worry about me, girl.
I'll get back.
I'm coming now.
What are you after doin' pulling me out, with Father Murphy lookin' at us, neither?
I can't afford an army of caretakers for the little use I have of the place, but I don't like to see the weeds higher than the summer house.
Someone's after poaching rabbits.
Ah, that's a thing
I want you to put a stop to.
Old Darby couldn't catch a poacher if he tried.
Like enough he helped to set the snare.
Now, I don't want any bad feeling between the townspeople and me.
I like 'em, mind you, and so will you,
- but don't like 'em too much.
- No, sir. No poachers.
Well, well, well, sir.
I never thought I'd have the pleasure of seeing Your Lordship so soon.
Yes, it looks as if you weren't quite ready for me.
One more day, and I'll have the whole place beautified.
Darby, this is Michael MacBride, a Dublin man.
I've decided to settle him here in your place.
I know it sounds sudden, but I've had it in mind for some time.
You've served me well, Darby, but we need a younger man here.
When a man gets along in years, he shouldn't have to work so hard, so I'm going to retire you on half pay, let you have the old McCarthy cottage rent-free for the rest of your days.
And leave the gatehouse?
It's become our home.
Well, so will the other in time.
- I don't think Katie will take to this.
- We'll give it a new thatch.
But what am I going to do with meself, and me cut off in me prime?
You'll be telling stories at the public house all day, and poaching rabbits by night.
Holy old Finbar!
What with the foxes eatin' the grouse, don't tell me I set a snare down a rabbit hole.
You're an old fox yourself, Darby, but, faith, I'm fond of you and Katie, too.
Whenever we have to open up the manor house, she can have first call with the cleaning.
Pardon me, sir, but when have we got to leave the gatehouse?
Can we give them another two weeks?
Longer than that, sir, as far as I'm concerned.
Good. Then tonight, when you finish today's work here, you tell Tom Kerrigan to let you have a room at the Rathcullen Arms.
Please, sir, I'd be grateful if you wouldn't mention it to Katie.
I want to break the news to her meself.
Very well, but remember I said two weeks, Darby, not two years.
When I return here on Monday week,
I want you out and Michael in and everything settled and done.
Yes, sir.
Good day, Your Lordship!
Well, goodbye, Mr. O'Gill.
Now here, wouldn't it be a shame to put his lordship to the expense of a room in the pub and Katie and me fair rockin' around in the gatehouse?
That's very kind of you, but I don't think his lordship would like it.
Why wouldn't he? Sure I can instruct you on your new duties. Katie!
Yes, Father?
- This is Mister, uh...
- MacBride.
Mr. MacBride is comin' to stay with us for a while, so throw some extra spuds in the pot for supper and make up the bed in the loft.
If it's any trouble, I can go to the inn.
It's no trouble at all.
Pony!
- Come with me.
- What's up with you now?
I want you outside where his lordship can have a look at you.
Why should he want a look at me?
'Cause you're going to be a consequential man and have Darby's fine position as his lordship's caretaker and Katie O'Gill for your wife.
Huh, and when the sky falls, we'll all catch larks.
I mean it, Pony. I had a talk with his lordship about you, and I tell you it's only a matter of time.
I put a flea in Katie's ear, too.
I wouldn't worry about her.
With a fine situation like that,
I could have me choice of girls.
Katie might help you get it.
- Maybe you're right.
- Here he comes.
Smile, me darling.
Smile.
This is m'lad Pony, Your Lordship, the one I told you about.
Your servant, sir.
Well, he's a big man, isn't he, now?
Nice to meet you, Pony.
(clears throat)
"A big man," says he.
What did I tell you?
You'll get the job in no time at all.
Ah, Katie, you should have saw the turf the two of us cut this afternoon.
That was a grand bit of work you done. So it was, aye.
His lordship thought I could use a lad to help with the turf before the rains came.
And me doin' 10 men's work already.
Come, lad, sit down.
Take the air of the fire, and I'll play you a tune while the pot's on the boil.
(# plucks strings)
Ah, that's good.
(# playing lively tune)
- Can you put a name to that?
- Hmm? Uh, no, it's... it's new to me.
What's it called?
Them as I heard it from give it no name.
Well, where did you hear it?
In the old ruins on the top of Knocknasheega, and there were the little people dancing all around in the moonlight.
Well, aren't they the bold creatures?
Aye, they are.
Supper's ready.
Bold and cunning, they are, but I'm up to them.
Once I caught King Brian himself, and he gave me the gold, though I'd no need for it.
But, faith, I have need for it now.
Shh.
(whispers)
Don't breathe a word.
Tomorrow at dawn I've got to go to Glencove to bring back a bell for the chapel.
I'll have to round up the horse, now, before she runs all over the mountainside.
I'll be glad to give you a hand.
I was just going to ask you to go the rounds of the manor house and try all the doors and the windows.
Right so, but after that, I think I'll go down to the Rathcullen Arms and see about a room.
Now, why would you be doin' that?
I don't like to take hospitality under false pretenses, and besides, two weeks from today, you must leave here.
- I think your daughter should know.
- Oh, she will, she will.
Then why let her believe that I was brought here only for the cuttin' of the turf?
You see, she was born in the gatehouse, and for 20 years, she's lived in it.
It gives us a standin' in the town.
No, I'll tell her when the time comes.
I can't break it out of a clear sky like a crack of thunder.
Well, when will you tell her?
- The first good chance I get.
- Then do it soon.
I'll tell her, I'll tell her.
Here, I'm used to the dark.
- Watch out for poachers.
- I'll do that.
Come on now, Cleopatra.
Wait now, darlin'.
Devil take you!
Come back here!
Come back to your master.
Wait till I catch you.
Cleopatra, come on, now.
Cleopatra, where are you?
I'm lookin' for you.
Can't you hear me?
Cleopatra.
Ah, there you are.
What do you think you're doin'?
Hop out of that.
Do you want to break a leg?
Whoa! Whoa, there.
Whoa! Whoa, I tell you.
Whoa! Whoa!
Whoa, there.
Whoa!
Get down! Whoa!
- (neighing)
- Get down!
(screaming)
- So that's Darby O'Gill, is it?
- Aye, it is.
I wonder why his honor put the come-hither on the likes of that.
Sure there's no more life in him than a potato vine after a frost.
Well, either he's hard asleep or he's killed entirely.
Let's find out.
(grunts)
You murderin' little heathens!
- Watch your stick.
- Oh! Hey! Get off me!
Wait, wait.
Hey! Ooh!
(laughing)
(grunting, groaning)
Come on, you blackguard, now we'll take you to the king.
There's no tellin' what he'll do to you.
No tellin' indeed.
(laughs)
(# bagpipes and drums playing)
- Come on.
- Hurry up!
Darby O'Gill is here.
He's come.
(music stops)
Come in, man.
Come in.
All right,
Your Royal Highness.
Well, Darby O'Gill, 'tis pleased and delighted I am to see you again.
Thank you, sir.
It's a grand place you got here.
Ah, it does well enough.
Sit down, man.
Over there.
Drop the lid, man.
It's only an old chest full of jewels.
We took it from the Spanish ships when the Armada
- was wrecked on our coast.
- Is that so?
Ship's gun, too.
Oh, that's a fine piece.
- It is indeed.
- And the throne?
By all the goats in Kerry, do you think I'd sit on a Spanish throne?
This once belonged to Fergus mac Leda, ancient high king of all Ireland.
- Do you say so?
- I do.
And over there, the gold cup of Cormac.
And here's the sword of Brian Boru, who drove out the Danes.
And over there you see the harp.
Don't tell me it's "the harp that once through Tara's Hall the soul of music shed."
Aye, it is that same.
I declare to me soul, when I tell them this down in the pub, they won't believe a word of it.
Ah, you can't do that, Darby.
Once you're here, there's no going back.
I've got to get back to Katie.
Ah, you needn't worry about Katie.
She'll give you a grand wake, and then she'll forget all about you.
- Mind what you say about Katie.
- Calm yourself, now. Calm yourself!
- What have I ever done to you?
- Nothin', Darby.
- Who tells all the stories about you?
- You do, Darby.
Aye, and who makes the women watch where they're throwin' their wash water when you and your lads are out walkin' invisible?
You do, Darby.
And who makes the men tip their hats respectful to every swirl of dust?
You.
You've done grand.
So you put the come-hither on me.
That's how you pay me back, you ungrateful little frainey.
Your heart's as cold as a wet Christmas.
(shouting)
Blackguard!
They better watch what they're saying. I speak Gaelic, too.
- Now, you listen to me.
- No, you listen to me.
Phadrig Oge was standing under the white thorn tree by the summer house when his lordship gave you the bad news today, and the moment
I heard you were in trouble,
I swore I'd take you out of it.
If you're the fine, decent man
I think you are, you'll be showin' me a little bit of gratitude.
I am grateful.
Then you can say goodbye to the tears and the troubles of the world outside. There's nothin' but fun and diversion here.
Now, what'll you do first, Darby?
- Well, I don't know.
- Would you care to play the harp?
No, I'm no great hand with the harp... but give me me old fiddle, and I'll play you a tune
- worth goin' a mile o' ground to hear.
- Grand.
Now, if someone will show me the way out, I'll go home for it.
None of your tricks, Darby.
I said you were here to stay.
Phadrig Oge!
- Yes, Your Highness?
- Fetch the Stradivarius.
Right away, Your Highness.
It was presented to me by the emperor of the Italian fairies in 1700.
It's a Stradivarius.
I'd rather have me own.
Ah, you'll have to make do with this one.
Go ahead, man.
Try it.
All right, then, if it makes you happy.
(# playing sad tune)
- Now give us a good one.
- All right, then.
Me grandfather Podge told me there were three things the little people were mad after:
Dancin', whiskey and huntin'.
Begorra!
He wasn't far wrong.
Then I'll give you the fox chase.
- (crowd murmuring)
- Ah, the fox chase.
First you'll hear the gathering of the huntsmen
- and the bayin' of the hounds.
- Grand.
Away we go.
(# playing lively tune)
(# playing faster)
(# playing faster)
(# playing faster)
(laughing)
Ooh!
(horn sounding)
Gone away!
(laughing)
Give us full cry!
(laughing)
(King Brian) A-ridling!
Oscul!
A-ridling!
Wait!
Wait, Your Highness. Wait!
(whinnies)
Whose side are you on, anyway?
You'll find out who's the knowledgeable one.
Come on, now.
Oh, it's not for me.
I'm expectin' company.
If I can only hold him here till cockcrow, you'll see what'll happen to your friend when daylight comes. Aye.
(door banging)
And... And how was the chase, hm?
We were chasin' the wrong fox, but I've run you to earth at last.
What do you mean, sir?
- I've a good mind to break your back!
- I thought we were friends.
You've made a laughingstock of me in front of my own people!
- I don't understand.
- When his lordship kicked you out,
- who took you in?
- You did.
And what did you do the minute my back was turned?
Oh, I-I just went back for me pipe.
You didn't think I wanted to stay here, did you?
How could any man who's had one look inside the fairy mountain be content with anything else?
Faith, I never saw dancin' so fine or heard pipin' so shockin' sweet or touched a fiddle so grand, and never in me wildest dreams did I dream I'd be sittin' on diamonds.
No, indeed.
All I want from here is me old duidin.
Well, you better make sure.
We can't have you goin' in and out.
No, not a thing else.
- I'll not even be needin' this.
- And what might that be, now?
It's a drop of old poteen
I found in the bog.
Oh, it has a real smack to it.
I'd offer you a drop, only it wouldn't be fine enough for Your Royal Highness.
Let me be the judge of that.
Well, very good,
Your Royal Highness.
Well, here goes.
Ahh.
It drinks cool and easy, so it does.
I'm plenty glad you like it.
Now we'd better be on our way.
I can't wait to get back to all that music and fun and diversion.
Now, just a minute.
We've a fine bit of diversion right here.
Sit down now and have one with me for friendship's sake.
Well, if you insist,
Your Royal Highness...
- I'll join you.
- Good man, yourself, and if it's music you're after, what about a song?
- A song?
- Aye.
- Do you know the "Wishing Song"?
- I do not.
Oh, we better not try it, then.
You have to make it up as you go.
(laughs) I can make up a thousand songs, so I can.
Can you?
- Of course I can.
- All right, then.
The "Wishing Song."
# Oh, I wish I had time to sing you a song
# But when I get started,
I sing all night long
- (laughs)
- Ha.
Can you put a rhyme to that?
- Try me.
- Go on, then.
# Oh, singin's no sin and drinkin's no crime
# If you have one drink only, just one at a time
(Darby laughs)
# Oh, I wish all the rhymers were like Brian Connors
# When it comes to rhymin', he takes all the honors
(Darby laughs)
(laughing)
- Can you beat that?
- Hold your whisht.
# Oh, I knew you could sing when you opened your mug
# So you carry the tune and I'll carry the jug
That's a good one.
Could we have another round?
- There's nothin' stoppin' us.
- Good.
# Oh, I wish all barmaids
# Were like Mary McCluskey
"McCluskey"?
# When she served you a drink
# Why, she served you good "whuskey"
(laughing)
Oh, that's a thunderin' good rhyme,
"McCluskey" and "whuskey."
Did you ever hear the like of it?
# But Mary, she married poor Jimmy McQueen
# 'Cause she wanted her name to rhyme with "poteen"
- Oh, I've got a good one.
- So have I.
# Oh, I wish I was married to old Widow Tunney
# She's ugly as sin but has beautiful money
- Slainte, lad.
- Slainte go saol agat.
(laughing)
(groaning)
(both continue laughing)
(snores)
(# King hums the "Wishing Song")
How many verses have we sung?
- Well, here's the 80th for you.
# Oh, I wish that all mortals were like my friend Darby
# He's full of poteen, but he's fuller of blarney
(laughing)
- That's a tough one.
- (King laughs)
- Well, here's 81.
- Ha! Ha! Ugh!
# I wish all the gentry were like the King Brian
# If he can't beat ya drinkin',
# He'll fall down a-tryin'#
(both laughing)
(roostercrows)
(laughing)
Good mornin', me old bucko.
(laughing)
Open your door.
Can you not go through it anymore?
Try again.
Would you violate the sacred rites of hospitality?
I would.
How would you like to have me put a lump on your back?
I know you can't work your charms in the daytime, and when you couldn't go through that door, I knew I had you.
You murderin', deceitful, blind-staggerin' old truaillidh moran!
When me strength comes back in the nighttime,
I'll put an elephant's head on you and have you crawl on all fours and eat grass that won't nourish you
- till you shrivel up and die!
- Whoo-hoo, hullabaloo!
(cat meows)
Ah, good mornin', Ginger.
Have you come for your breakfast?
Well, there's a tasty morsel
I've no further use for.
Don't let him loose.
Don't let him loose!
Shrivel him up.
Put a hump in his back.
Have mercy, Darby.
Spare me and I'll grant you your three wishes all over again!
Do you hear that, Ginger?
Now, go on, wish them.
Sure now, I might wish for the crock of gold.
- Go on!
- Or I might wish for... let's see...
- Long life.
- Yes.
Or I might wish for a carriage and pair.
- Granted. Granted.
- (Ginger meowing)
Granted!
But I haven't wished a wish yet.
I said I might.
Get on with it, then.
Wish your wishes, and since we've had such a grand night of it, you can have as many as you like.
So that's good of you.
"Three wishes I'll grant you, big wishes and small, but if you wish a fourth, you'll get none at all."
(laughing)
Ah, what a memory you've got, you wicked old scut.
(laughing)
But before I make a wish,
I'll have to talk with Katie.
- I'll make one.
- Go on, go on.
One wish to protect the other two.
Now, me first wish is that you will not fly back to Knocknasheega, but you'll be at my beck and call for a fortnight at least, until I make the other two wishes.
You thief of the world.
Never in 1,000 years has a man taken such an underhanded advantage.
Faith, never in 5,000 years have you ever met a more knowledgeable adversary.
I am Brian of Knocknasheega, and never...
No! No!
Do you agree to the terms of the first wish?
I do, I do!
All right, then.
Go on, Ginger.
But how am I gonna protect myself while you're makin' up your mind?
Now, don't worry.
I'll take good care of you.
Aah!
No, no, no, you wicked old devil.
You murderin' old hypocrite!
Let me go! Let me out!
(muffled)
Let me out, do you hear me?
Now, what would she be doin' around here?
Always scroogin' round to the back door, beggin' something, borrowin' tea or something.
- Morning.
- Good morning.
- Did you sleep well?
- That I did, thank you.
Where's Darby?
His bed hasn't been slept in, but he'll turn up.
I gathered from something he said last night that he might capture the leprechaun.
- He has great games with them.
- When he's taken a draft too many?
He's not a drinkin' man.
But he's a lonely man since me mother died.
When he goes to the pub, it's for company, and when he makes his rounds at night, the wee folk give him sport.
Well, what about yourself?
Don't you get lonely?
I keep busy.
Rathcullen's a small, little place, but there are dances and hostings aplenty.
There's a dance on tonight.
Maybe you'd care to go,
Mr. MacBride?
No, not yet, thank you.
And, uh, by the way, my name is Michael.
Well, so it is, but until I've known you more than a day, your name is Mr. MacBride...
Mr. MacBride.
What was old Sheelah doin' around here?
She dropped in to pay back a pinch of tea.
Well, I don't like to see her about the place.
- Father, sit down and eat.
- She and her son Pony, they're two of a kind, neither of them up to any good.
She's only a poor old woman.
Old woman indeed.
Are you wearin' your holy medal?
- I am.
- Well, don't leave it off.
- She could be a witch.
- You'd better go to bed.
I can't. I got to go to Glencove to pick up a bell for Father Murphy.
'Tis a shame I'll not be here today to help you.
Oh, we can't let the cutting of the turf stand in the way of good deeds.
Well, me boy, seein' it's for one day only, could you leave the turf and cut the weeds around the summer house?
- I think I could.
- And, listen, if you make a good job of it,
I might keep you on.
How would you like workin' for me, anyway?
Why would he want to work for you?
You haven't one shilling to rub against the other.
Katie, me dear, there's been a change in our fortunes for the better.
I'm thinkin' of buyin' the manor house for meself and shiftin' you out of here into surroundin's more in keepin' with your charm and beauty.
Well, I wouldn't want to live in the manor house.
You know as well as I do, his lordship would never sell it.
What do you want?
You've only got to name it.
I don't want anything.
Now, sit down.
I suppose you don't want to hear about the great battle
I fought with the powers of darkness.
I do not.
Now, sit down and eat your stirabout.
She should be the caretaker.
She's got a tongue would clip a hedge.
(Michael) # Have you ever seen the sea gulls
# A- flyin' o'er the heather
# Or the crimson sails in Galway Bay
# The fishermen unfurl
# Oh, the earth is filled with beauty
# And it's gathered all together
# In the form and face and dainty grace
# Of a pretty Irish girl
# Oh, she is my dear my darlin' one
# Her eyes so sparklin' full of fun
# No other, no other can match the likes of her
# She is my dear my darlin' one
# My smilin' and beguilin' one
# I love the ground she walks upon
# My darling Irish girl
I called you when your food was ready, but you were makin' so much noise, you couldn't hear me.
Faith, I know I can't sing a lick, but when I'm roarin' like Doran's bull, it works up a killin' hunger in me.
What have we got here?
Bread newly baked, butter fresh from the churn, and boiled eggs and ham.
Well, now, aren't you the clever girl?
You have enough here to feed the parish.
I thought you'd be hungry.
- I hope the bread has cooled.
- Oh, I like it hot.
Mile murder! Did no one ever tell you the hazard of hot bread?
No, they didn't, ah...
Sure you can see I need someone to watch over me.
Did your father say anything this morning before he left?
He said he would be back by sundown.
Nothin' about me?
- He said you were a good lad.
- That's all?
- Isn't that enough?
- I suppose it is.
Tell me, Katie, do you think I'm a good lad?
I very greatly doubt it.
(bell chiming)
(cheering)
Aye, you look fine, Darby!
Hey, all right!
It's a grand bell.
You've done a great deed.
Thank you, Father.
Thank you, Father.
Darby!
- What have you got in the bag?
- Well, uh, Father, it would be a hard thing to explain.
Oh, now, you could try.
Well, like, it's a kind of financial venture, you might say.
A financial venture that you'd be afraid to tell your priest about?
Oh, no, no, no.
Sure I'm on the side of the angels, against the powers of darkness.
What would you say,
Father, if I told you
I captured the king of the little people?
I'd say you had imagined it.
Ha-ha. Then I've nothin' at all in the bag here, Reverend.
Nothin' at all.
(laughing)
(cheering)
Glory be to the saints of joy.
This is a great day for Rathcullen.
You've certainly earned a glass of stout, Darby.
Aye, it's dry work cartin' a bell.
May we all live to see...
- Would a toast be a kind of wish?
- It would.
Oh, well, then, devil a toast will I drink this day.
What's in there?
The renowned Brian Connors, king of all the leprechauns.
One wish I wished already, but I'm not lettin' him out of this bag until I've wished the other two.
What does he look like, Darby?
Ah, just a teeny-weeny tawny little atom-y kind of gentleman with a beard on his face and a crown like a fistful of horns on his head.
Let's have a look at him, Darby.
Let's have a look at the little gentleman.
Oh, never mind, then.
Sure it's only
Lady Fitzpatrick's prize hen, the one they gave the red ribbon to at the fair.
(imitating chickens clucking)
Fill the little pannikin, 20 year old, the best in the house.
I will, Darby.
Thank you.
Here you are, Your Majesty.
(gulping noise)
(King Brian) Ah.
- Did you see that?
- I saw it with me own two eyes.
Give me the glass, Tom.
That's a story will bear repeatin'.
And if any man doubts the truth of it, there's the very same glass.
# Bum-ba-dum-ba-da-da-dee-dee

- Now, where did you hear that?
- Michael was singin' it.
# My pretty Irish girl #
- Where are you off to?
- To a dance.
With Michael?
No. Michael's goin' your rounds for you.
He is?
Why'd he do that?
Well, he said you were worried about the poachers.
If I hurry, I'll catch up with him.
- Ah, the devil take you!
- Darby!
What ails you, lad?
Is it blind you are?
I am indeed. Sure when I saw man running in the dark with a game bag in his hand, wasn't I the foolish one to mistake him for a poacher?
By the hokey, it did look bad.
Will you forgive me?
Faith, a stepmother wouldn't blame ye.
No harm done.
I'm sorry, but I promised his lordship there'd be no poaching, and I can't make an exception, not even for you,
- so you'll have to let the rabbit go.
- Rabbit indeed.
(laughing)
I didn't intend to show him yet, but you've been a nice fella.
I'll give you the first look.
Bring him over here. Come on.
Get ready for the grand surprise.
It's no rabbit.
- Rabbit or hare, what's the odds?
- Rabbit or hare?
You're lookin' at Brian of Knocknasheega,
- king of all the leprechauns.
- 'Twas a rabbit I saw.
Have another look.
It's still a rabbit.
- Try closin' one eye.
- Closing one eye?
Ah, you've had a hard day today, and a hard night last night.
Now, why don't you go home to bed and get a good rest?
How could I rest, and you thinkin' I'm a poacher?
They take different shapes, you know?
So I hear.
Aye, you ought to see him with his little gold crown and his red beard and his two eyes leapin' from his head like flames.
- I wish you could see him.
- Granted.
And that's your second wish.
Why, you tricky, deceivin', connivin', double-dealin',
- high-handed...
- Oh, wirra, wirra, wirra.
That's what comes of a man not yet threescore and 10 matchin' his wits against an intellectual gladiator 5,000 years old.
Well, I still have me third wish left, and maybe me second one's not all wasted.
Now, go on.
Make yourself visible to him.
But I am visible to him.
You wished he should see me, and see me he does.
- He sees me as a rabbit.
- You're a cheat and you're a liar.
- Don't tell me you can't hear him.
- I'm afraid I can't.
What's the world comin' to?
I could have knocked a crock of gold out of this old chancer with that second wish, but I gave it all up for a man who can neither hear nor see.
Darby, he can see me as I really am... in his dreams tonight.
You can see him tonight in your dreams.
Are you sure?
I am.
He promised me.
Ah, the last reel was the best one.
You know, Katie, you're so light on your feet, you could tread on cobwebs without breaking them.
- Thank you, Sean.
- May I take you home now?
No need to trouble yourself.
Katie can ride home with me.
- I think it...
- Can't she?
That'll be grand, Pony.
- Good night, Sean.
- Good night, Katie.
(clicks tongue)
Come on. Hup! Hup!
Thank you for the ride.
Good night, Pony.
Have you no pride, ridin' home with the like of that?
He was only bein' civil to me, and I was no more than civil to him.
Well, you'd better forget about him altogether.
Well, maybe I will... when me father stops spyin' on me at windows.
Oh, tare and ages!
Isn't that a nice way for a girl to talk to her father?
And she me one and only.
She's a fine girl, Katie, but she's in mortal danger.
- How do you mean that?
- 'Tis you, the way you're dillydallyin' with your wishes.
Phadrig Oge, he's me lieutenant.
He'll stop at nothin' till he gets me back.
He might even put the come-hither on Katie, so's you'd have to wish her free again.
If he lays a finger on Katie,
I'll kill you dead and murder you entirely.
- Tell your Phadrig Oge that!
- Tell him?
How can I give the order, and me tied up in a sack?
I'll throw you in the river and drown you like a kitten.
Do that, and you'll have a scourge that'll make the potato famine
- look like a Sunday regatta.
- Don't you threaten me.
Your cows will die of the black leg and your sheep of the red water, and in every cradle in town there'll be a changeling!
I'm not afraid of you.
You'd better be.
I'm the one that keeps my kingdom in order, and all the unpleasant spirits of the night will run wild unless you wish your wish and let me go.
To tell you the truth,
I don't know what to wish for.
Then, uh, wish for the gold.
I'll give it to you this time.
Ah, she doesn't want the gold nor the manor house, neither.
- Who doesn't?
- Katie, I'm thinkin' of.
Well, uh, what does she want?
I don't know.
We were happy here, the two of us, but when I catch her dancin' and whirligiggin' with a drunken blatherumskite like Pony Sugrue... well, I don't know her at all.
Ah, she needs to settle her mind on a good steady lad with temperate ways.
That she does.
What if she found such a lad and fell in love with him, and he with her?
Would you wish your wish then?
I would.
Good.
Now, go to bed, have a good sleep.
Leave all to me.
Put your mind at rest.
Michael.
Michael.
What do you want?
I said I'd visit your dreams, and when I make a promise,
I keep it.
Well, I've seen you.
Now go away.
Ah, but I...
- I'd like to talk about Katie.
- How does she concern you?
She's the one that's keepin' me here.
Darby won't wish any more wishes until his girl is pleased.
Well, what can I do about it?
Marry her, and you can all live here as happy as three peas in a pod.
I hardly know the girl.
One look at her and you'll know her.
She's a nice girl and I like her, but...
Good.
Then next Sunday after Mass, take her up to the ruins on the top of Knocknasheega.
'Tis a fine romantic view from there.
Just lookin' down will make any girl so dizzy, she'll fall into your arms.
I don't want her to fall into my arms.
But then, of course,
I can't very well blame you.
Might mean gettin' your head broken.
I know if I was courtin'
Pony Sugrue's girl,
I'd be afraid, too.
Is it puttin' the coward's name on me you are?
Ah, no, no, no.
No, no. Go to sleep now.
Go to sleep.
Good lad.
Go to sleep.
Katie.
Katie.
I say, Katie.
He's a fine strong lad with temperate ways.
Hmm?
Michael is a fine strong lad with temperate ways.
He'd make you a grand husband.
I don't want a husband.
Not yet.
Not yet? Oh, Katie, many a girl has spoke these words and lived to rue them.
You know, when a girl is 20, her boy will marry her up in a minute, but when she's 30, doesn't she have a time trying to make him say the hard word?
- I'll have me courtship first.
- Courtship, is it?
And marriage the bone and sinew of the country?
What would you call a girl who'd keep her lad dangling through pure selfishness or sinful dalliance?
I know what I'd call her.
I'd call her...
I'd...
Katie.
Katie.
(whispers) Yes?
I returned as a matter of courtesy to give you the last word.
Me last word... is no.
That's grand.
That's grand.
Keep on sayin' that.
Keep on sayin' that.
(whispers) Keep on sayin' that.
"The ruins of old Ireland, how wondrously they stand
"by the lakes and rushing rivers on the hilltops of our land."
"Around these walls of battle, the Viking and the Dane, the Norman and the Saxon and the Cavaliers of Spain."
Ah, it makes a man feel like the lord of the castle.
I wonder now, is it the Danes or the Vikings swarming up the valley to storm the fort?
- The Danes.
- We'll both be put to the sword.
But before we are, you would crave the favor of one last kiss.
Mr. MacBride, I thought you could do better than that.
Maybe I could.
(laughing)
(gasps)
You don't care who you walk out with, do you?
Get off this land, or I'll report you to his lordship.
You do that.
(laughs)
Get out of the way.
Look who's talking.
If you lay a finger on him,
I'll never speak to you again!
Katie... when I need your help against the likes of that, I'll ask for it.
Pony Sugrue would have killed you.
- Would you care?
- Not in the slightest.
You have no interest in me at all?
You're certain sure?
Kiss her.
Kiss her.
Go on, kiss her.
Aah!
And him a Dublin man!
Look, look, look.
Will you wish your wish now?
- I will indeed.
- Good.
(bell chiming)
The bell.
Listen to the music of it.
Father Murphy gave it to me.
But the wish, Darby.
Ah, it would charm the fishes from the deep and the little birds down from the trees.
You said you'd wish your wish.
What? On Sunday, with my music floatin' over the countryside and Father Murphy himself pullin' the rope?
Tomorrow is Monday.
Will you wish your wish then?
I will.
Hush now.
Listen to my music.
Whoa, there.
Hello, Joe.
Morning, Mrs. O'Toole.
There's the post.
Did the tea come down from Dublin?
The pails, too.
Where's everybody going?
To the pub.
Darby is making his third wish.
His third wish?
The old fool.
Old fool indeed.
It's makin' too free with them, Darby is.
When you sup with the devil, you need a long spoon.
From America.
Nora Cassidy's son.
- Ah, there'll be money in that.
- The pails, Mrs. O'Toole.
- Right you are, Pony.
- "Michael MacBride, Rathcullen."
That's from the Lord Fitzpatrick.
I'd know his fist anywhere.
Look at the elegant swirls and all.
So that's why his lordship left him behind.
And now 'tis "Michael" this and "Michael" that.
The Dublin jackeen.
"And, Michael, go and open up the manor house
- and get Katie in to help."
- The dirty usurper!
- Poor old Darby.
- Poor Katie.
I wonder, does she know?
Maybe you should drop it by and leave her see it for herself.
Oh.
You think I should, now?
No Christian bein' would do any less.
Then I will so.
Look, Pony, his lordship wrote it to young Michael MacBride, and nary a word to Darby, now I ask you.
Ha! And you said you had an understanding with his lordship about me, and all this time,
MacBride has the job.
He won't keep the job if I have a son who's man enough to run him out of town.
Well, Pony?
What are you doing?
I'm packing, and if you don't know why, you can read the card.
Why didn't you tell me?
Your father made me promise that I wouldn't.
- When are you throwin' us out?
- Oh, now, Katie.
- When?
- Well, today was supposed to have...
- You give short notice.
- I don't want you to leave at all.
Why not?
What does it matter to you if you break an old man's heart?
You're a strong young man.
You can find work anywhere, but, no, you must come here and take me father's place.
No wonder he's chasin' the fairy gold, and him half out of his mind, tryin' to keep some little bit of self-respect in the town.
Here, you can clean the manor house yourself.
It'll be all we can do to move our belongin's out of your house this night.
Now, you listen to me.
I don't want your father's job at all, not unless I can have the both of you along with it.
I want you to stay here and be my wife.
I love you, Katie, and I think that you love me.
I?
Love you?
- Everybody ready?
- Yes, we're all ready, Darby.
Run and get a turf creel, a big one.
- What for?
- For to hold the gold.
- I'll not wish for the gold.
- Why not?
Nine times out of ten, it leads to unhappiness.
Wish for happiness, then.
Human beings need bitter with the sweet.
When I was a young lad, knee high with a sod of turf, me grandfather Podge...
God be good to him...
...he told me there was only one man in the town who was happy altogether... the village idiot.
- (laughter)
- (King Brian) Ha!
Were you addressing me,
Your Majesty?
What's all the speechmaking about?
Are you standin' for Parliament or what?
- Will I get you a drink, sir?
- You could make a wish.
- Get on with it.
- I'll do that.
You know what I'd wish for, Darby?
I'd wish for a grand, big house on top of a hill, as big as the castle at Cong.
- How would you look after it?
- I'd have the servants, too.
You didn't wish for the servants,
You didn't wish for the money to run the house.
There you'd be with a big house in your hands, as big as a church, and you the poorest church mouse in it.
Did you hear that?
Oh, he's got a head on his shoulders like Aristotle.
- Think of the best...
- Father!
Then ask yourself,
"What else might I lose if I had it?"
Father, you've got to come and catch the horse.
Not now, Katie.
His lordship is comin'.
We've got to move today!
Move out of the way, Katie.
I'm makin' me third wish.
Not here, Father!
Wait, Your Highness!
Wait, Your Highness.
Wait!
(mocking) Wait, Your Highness.
Wait!
(man) Catch him, Darby!
Catch the coinin!
(all shouting)
Darby, catch the coinin!
Make him give you the crocks of gold!
The crocks of gold!
- Get out of my way.
- Leave that horse alone.
Do you think I'd stay under your roof another night?
- I'll go to the inn.
- You can go to blazes.
I'm movin' to the McCarthy house.
With night coming down on that mountainside, you could get yourself killed.
Now, give me that halter.
I'll get the horse.
Ah, well, you look grand.
Now, don't move a finger until his lordship comes.
Katie!
Katie!
Katie!
Katie!
Katie!
Katie!
(sniffs)
Is it drunk you are?
- Who did it, lad?
- I don't know, but I can guess.
- Where's Katie?
- She's gone after the horse.
Did you let her go alone in the dark of the night?
She was in a tearin' rage at me, and sure it was your fault for not telling her the truth in the first place.
God forgive me.
She'll be chasin' a puca.
Oh, for goodness sakes.
(female voice wailing)
- The banshee!
- Maybe it's just the wind.
It's the wail of the banshee, the same as I heard the night that Katie's mother was taken.
She'll be destroyed entirely!
(thunder rumbling)
Katie!
Katie!
Katie!
(echo) Katie!
Katie!
(echo) Katie!
Katie!
Katie!
Katie.
Katie!
Katie!
Katie!
The banshee!
(wailing)
Keep away!
Keep away!
Keep away from her!
Keep off!
(wailing loudly)
Keep off, now!
Keep off, now!
Oh, me poor darlin'.
Your daddy didn't mean to do you any harm.
- Speak to me. Speak to me.
- Darby.
What have I done to you?
We'd better get her home.
(banshee wailing)
Brian!
King Brian!
King Brian!
King Brian!
What is it, man?
- Your Highness!
- What is it?
It's the coiste-bodhar, the death coach.
Send it away!
It's comin' for Katie.
Send it away.
But it's not within my powers, man.
Once it sets out, it can never return empty.
Then give me me third wish and let it take me instead.
You don't know what you're askin' for.
You promised!
Don't break your word.
Darby O'Gill, never in me born days...
Give me me third wish.
More's the pity.
Granted.
Darby O'Gill.
Get in.
(King Brian) Darby.
Darby.
I was on me way back home, and I says to meself,
"Brian," says I,
"'tis at his side you should be."
Well, then, the truth of it is,
I'm real glad to see you.
Ah, Darby, me boy,
- we've had great sport together.
- Aye, we did.
You've been a grand adversary.
'Tis sorry I am to see you come to this.
I can endure anything if Katie was all right.
Ah, you needn't fret about Katie.
Her fever broke the minute you set foot in this coach.
I'll be forever grateful to you.
In the years to come, maybe you'd keep an eye on Katie and Michael.
I'll do that.
'Tis a pity you won't be there to see them married.
Ah, it's better for the old to die than the young.
In the end, we all have to go.
That you do.
I wish I could go with you all the way.
I wish you could, too.
(laughing)
And you a knowledgeable man!
Darby, you've wished your fourth wish.
Goodbye, Darby, me friend.
(King Brian laughs)
It's a miracle. She's fine and sonsy, like a baby woken from sleep.
Michael, what a temper I have.
Well...
I like a lively girl.
I suppose I'm the only man alive today
to have rode in the coiste-bodhar and come back to tell it.
Coiste-bodhar.
'Twas his lordship's carriage you saw.
His coachman told me they found you rootin' in the mud of the road, so far gone in grief you were out of your mind entirely.
(laughs)
Pony, I heard you were goin' to live in Cahersiveen.
I am.
Then why don't you be on your way and leave us alone?
Don't worry.
I will.
I've heard enough silly blather about little people to last me a lifetime.
What kind of man are you at all that doesn't believe in the little people?
- Maybe you'd like to find out.
- Indeed I would.
You know, somebody beat me over the head that night, and I thought it was the little people, but when I spoke to King Brian about it, he said that you should take the consequences.
What consequences?
Indeed, that's what I asked his majesty, and you know what he said?
He said, "If I were you,
I'd clout the blackguard in the face."
- Ooh.
- (glass breaks)
Oh!
- (glass breaks)
- Ooh! Oh, gosh.
Ooh!
(whispers) Come on.
(whimpers)
Pony, me darlin'.
Oh, you poor thing.
Hold your whisht.
I'll have no more from you.
- Well, that didn't take long.
- Now I can get back to work.
I even feel like workin' meself.
I do indeed. Aye.
How do you feel about bringin' in the rest of the turf?
Well, lad, you took the words right out of me mouth.
Come around, Cleopatra.
Come on, now.
# Oh, she is my dear my darlin' one
# Her eyes so sparklin' full of fun
# No other, no other can match the likes of her
# Oh, he is my dear my darling one
# His eyes so sparkling full of fun
# No other, no other
# Can match the likes of him
(both) # She is my dear, my darlin' one
# My smilin' and beguilin' one
# I love the ground she walks upon
# My darlin' Irish...
- # Girl #

My name is Group Captain Todd.
During the I was commanded an RAF station on the east coast of England.
This is a story of some of the men of an air-sea rescue unit...
... who served under my command.
They didn't fly, but went to sea on high-speed launches.
Their job, to rescue their comrades from the sea.
Their motto:
The time is the autumn of 1944.
The allied armies are sweeping through France...
...and thrusting towards Belgium and Holland.
# If I only had wings... #
Go on, kids, get some sea servicing.
# I'd fly up high #
# Up in the sky #
Shut it in and prime the port engine, can't you, Dray?
Okay, corp.
# If I only had wings... #
Go on, rupt yourself, do!
Stand up!
- Well, what's your name?
- Milliken, sir.
Who are you, what are you?
Armorer, electrician, sanitary welder?
Medical orderly, sir.
Told to report to 2561.
Medical orderly?
Well, what was you in civvy street, a chartered accountant?
- No, sir.
- Don't call me sir.
Save your sirs for the skipper.
He's an officer and knows nothing...
...and therefore entitled to be called sir.
See these?
These indicate the most important rank in the Royal Air Force.
Oy, now then.
What am I?
- A Flight Sergeant.
- And don't you forget it!
No, Flight.
Flight, he says.
Just like that.
What the war does for the Air Force.
When I joined the service it was,
"Yes, Flight Sergeant.", "No, Flight Sergeant."
Three bags full, Flight Sergeant.
Stand still!
My name's Slingsby.
Flight Sergeant Slingsby.
I drink blood and eat grenades.
- Morning, lads.
- Morning, sir. All right, son, fall out.
- Move on, sir? On to sea?
- Tell the engine to start up.
Aye, aye, sir.
Start up, below.
Okay, Dray, start them up.
- Let go springs.
- Springs out, sir.
- Let go out!
- All gone out, sir.
Let go fore head?
All done fore head, sir.
Fire the engine, Clarkson.
- First trip?
- Yes, corporal.
- It's nice and smoothe, isn't it?
- Yeah.
Just another pleasure cruise.
Come on, big time, there's no time for sleeping.
You're in the way.
Over in the bunk, go on!
Robbie, I'm going to change.
Okay, Chiefy.
Have some corned-beef sandwich?
Best in the world, this is.
Here, doc.
- Put that on.
- Thanks, corporal.
There's an overcoat in there if you want it. It's gonna be cold.
Oh, you.
You married?
- No.
- Lucky you.
What's happened? We stopped.
Hey, Gus, do you reckon we'll be back on time?
- Why, are you in a hurry?
- Yes, I am.
Well, we won't then.
You'd better get your head down, Doc.
We've got a long way ahead of us.
Why, where are we?
We're on what's called rendez-vous.
We're going to stay here until somebody tells us to go home.
It's exciting, ain't it?
- You all right, Skip?
- I'm all right, give me a hand.
- Through the hatch, sir, up above.
- Right.
How are the others?
The dinghy's been ejected.
Make your way along to the wing, sir.
Will you finish buckling the belt?
Get in the dinghy.
The craft's going down any minute.
Come on, Skip, let's help him.
Any more for the skylark?
We got a long way to go.
You all right, Skip?
Yes, I'm all right. I got a bit of a whack in the bread basket...
- ...when we ditched, that's all.
- What happened exactly?
We got poked in the engine by a Messershmidt.
But if it's any consolation,
I returned the compliment.
Right now Jerry's on the North Sea, too, sitting on his own little rubber mat.
Boy, is he going to be lonely.
Do you think anyone saw us ditch, Canada?
I shouldn't think so.
I didn't see any ships or anything.
- Where are we exactly?
- Just off the coast of Holland, sir.
About 20 miles from the show.
And a long way from home.
Guess we'd better get organized.
- Canada, can you get that small box going?
- Right.
- Mac, can you set up the aerial?
- Yep.
- Would you mind helping, sir?
- Oh, of course, I'm in your hands.
All I want is to get this briefcase back safely to England.
You just treat me as one of the crew.
She's going.
Well, that's that.
Makes you think, doesn't it?
If any of us had anything sharp on us, rip, zip, and we'd be sitting on about
500 fathoms of ocean and nothing else.
Yes, sir, this little piece of rubber is all there is between us...
... and the bottom of the deep blue sea.
Come in.
- Yes, Flight?
- The weather's getting worse, sir.
- I've posted two bridge lookouts.
- Right.
By the way, how's the new boy?
His name's Milliken, sir.
Herbert Milliken.
- He's a bit seasick, but he'll do.
- You'll get him up to standard, anyway.
- Coffee?
- Thank you very much, sir.
Thank you.
- Is it true about the rumor, sir?
- Yes, this is my last trip.
I'm checking out of the unit at Gosport.
It's a promotion anyway.
I expect the wife's pleased.
How is she?
I took her to the hospital an hour before we left.
The baby's due any moment now.
Oh, by the way, my wife made this.
She asked me to give it with you.
It's a grey coat.
It'll fit a boy or a girl.
It's a nice cozy one.
Thank your wife for me, will you?
- I most certainly will.
- How's your boy?
- Well, he's let me down, sir.
- Why?
He joined the Navy yesterday.
Not again, Milliken!
I don't seem to be able to stop.
I knew a fellow once in the early days of air-sea rescue, he were a medical orderly, too.
He died from seasickness.
He strained his stomach.
Oh, it was a horrible sight.
Hi, Doc, still alive?
- How are you feeling?
- Sick.
There's hot soup in the forecastle.
Come on, I'll get you some.
Self-heated soup! I never touch it.
I don't trust them chemicals.
Come on, chap, get up on deck, you're on.
All right, corp.
Fill your bowls with this.
When's the return to base coming through, Robb?
I'm sick of this bit of sea.
The other bits are just the same.
I never want to see another boat after the war as long as I live.
Ten men and a medical orderly crammed aboard this tub.
What's the matter, Skinner?
Danger of losing a date?
Yeah, a WAF. She promised to see me last night at the station dance tonight.
I thought you were supposed to be overhauling the oil feed...
...on the port engine last night.
- Oh, I did that in 10 minutes.
- I thought it was a big job.
Duke said it would take all night.
The engines got us here and they'll get us back.
Come and take this message, will you, Knox?
There you are, Skinner, the one thing you can do well.
Return to base.
- Hey, Chiefy, Chiefy!
- What's up, Marshall?
There's a kite in the drink northeast of here.
Knox is just decoding them and they're not quite sure of it.
- Get up!
- Return to base, Flight?
Kite the drink.
Start up!
- Kite in the drink, sir.
- Come on boys, there's a kite in the drink.
This is it, Milliken, we're going to war.
- Ahead all speed, Flight.
- Ahead all speed, sir.
4050, 2000 revs.
Good morning.
Come in.
At ease.
- Good morning, sir.
- Sit down.
- Poor show, this.
- Yes, nothing further, I suppose?
We've had a signal.
The Hudson took off at 11:20.
The Air Commodore Waltby was definitely on board.
- It was that one?
- Looks like it.
There's no other aircraft reported overdue.
Not so far anyway.
If they are in the drink, there's a pretty fair chance of their being picked up.
They've got to be picked up.
I've had London on the phone.
Waltby was carrying a briefcase.
It's vital that neither he nor the briefcase shall be lost.
I know Waltby's number one buff on unguided missiles but...
I wonder what was in the briefcase.
It seems our people over there got hold of some papers.
Formula, blueprints, and so on.
Waltby was sent over to identify them.
London had word from him yesterday.
He's got the follow-on to the B-1 and the B-2.
I wonder if the Jerries knew about Waltby.
And deliberately shot them down?
I doubt it.
I'm going to see what's happening.
- Thanks. I'll keep you posted.
- Thank you, sir.
- Ah, Dray.
- Good morning, sir.
- Which is the Hudson?
- Here, sir.
It's only an approximate position, of course, sir.
I can't understand why we didn't get a better one.
Flight Sergeant MacKay is a good wireless operator.
If in fact the signal came from Harding's aircraft.
Oh, quite, sir.
We're only guessing.
There's still time to hear the Force landed somewhere in this country.
- Who picked the signal out?
- They heard that it Fellwell and Harbury.
A weak mayday signal without a call sign...
...lasting just long enough for them to get enough bearing.
Probably Harding's last chip before he ditched.
Yes, sir.
They've apparently got Air Commodore
Waltby with them, of course?
Yes, sir.
Do you know him, sir?
He's my brother-in-law.
The plane's the best part of an hour overdue.
Any shipping in the vicinity?
There are air-sea rescue launches north and south in the area.
What about Coastal Command?
They've got a couple of Sea Otters in the job and the Navy have sent at least one.
There's always the chance of an aircraft in the area picking up the signal, I suppose?
With a squawk box in a dinghy?
Oh, yes.
- What's the picture on the weather?
- A bit dicey, sir.
I'll get Commander Peeple to send someone up.
- Tell him to come to my office, will you?
- Very good, sir.
Main office?
- Good morning, sir.
- Morning, Scotty.
- Do you want me? I'm rather busy.
- I shan't keep you long, sir.
Well, all right.
I found something rather interesting this morning, sir.
Now, sir. What about this?
Rather wizard, I think.
I suggest we hang one up in the mess somewhere, shall we?
You're the adman officer, Scotty.
I leave it to you.
Roger, sir.
I'm just on my way to the canteen to give the boys a lecture on post-war planning.
- I might hang one up there too.
- Oh, you fix it, Scotty,
I'm rather occupied at the moment.
By the way, sir, about this ensign company... who's supposed to be giving a show here on Sunday. I...
Come in.
- Ah, Hart. Well, what's the picture?
- I'm afraid we're in for a nasty blow, sir.
What I really want to talk about, sir, is the new bus service to town.
Deal with it yourself, Scotty.
Roger, sir.
Stoneway reports clouds at 500 ft, heavy rain and a gale-force wind.
No flying.
That's about 400 miles north of here, isn't it?
- Yes, sir.
- How long before it reaches us?
It'll be here by this time tomorrow, if not before.
Just a bright day for flying, that's all we want.
The barometer is falling a little already, sir.
I guarantee that every time anyone ditches...
...the weather immediately starts to make things as difficult as possible.
When I ditched in 1940 it took two days to find me.
I never felt so cold and lonely in all my life.
As a matter of academic interest, has one of these things ever been known to turn over?
Judging by the way this one's behaving at the moment,
I reckon it can turn itself inside out if it tried real hard.
There's a whole lot of water getting in here.
Is there something I can bail with?
That briefcase would make a good bailer.
How about it, sir?
- I think not.
- You could shove the papers in your pockets.
- I think not.
- I don't see why...
Enough, Mac!
Do you think anybody's getting a signal from that thing, Canada?
- Sure, if it's working.
- It's working, all right.
Just as you say, bud.
It's a pity we didn't get a signal out before we ditched.
I hadn't got a chance, had I?
I made out a couple of maydays and the transmitter...
...went to pieces right in front of me eyes.
Sure, so nobody's got a bearing on us.
- At least not a good one.
- I did what I was supposed to do!
Keep your hair on, Mac.
Nobody's fault.
I mean, who'd expect to find a Jerry here at this time of the war?
Anyway, it helps to know he's got a wet behind, too.
It don't help mine any.
How long is it since we came down?
About 4 hours, sir.
It'll be dark in another hour or so.
Think of that.
And me, I had a date tonight.
Not another new popsy, Canada?
Not a new one.
Same as last week. And the week before.
Don't tell me it's the real thing this time.
Sure is. Hell, I didn't pluck up the courage to kiss her for two nights running.
That proves it then, doesn't it?
All right, I'll take it.
Come on, time we had some food.
Let's get the bag, Allan.
Better start on a strict ration right away.
We don't know how long we're going to make this lot last
Is it getting darned cold?
A nice warm blanket would be just the job now.
Look, Steve, here's my jacket.
I don't need it.
I've got a jacket.
You keep yours for yourself.
- But I can get a bang on the guts.
- I don't feel the cold, honest.
Don't be a clod, Mac.
If you don't feel the cold you must be dead or something.
No, you keep your jacket on.
Well, well, well!
Water purifying tablets.
That's gonna be real handy with all this sea around us.
What are those?
Oh, biscuits. They're useful.
And energy tablets.
Say, they think of everything.
Cigarettes, chewing gum...
...compass, and...
My, my, what a delicate thought!
Toilet paper.
All right...
One food tablet and one biscuit each for this meal.
What, no coffee and licors?
Oh, that reminds me.
- Brandy.
- Brandy?
No wonder you didn't want to let that case go, sir.
We'd better keep that till we need it.
What, when we're too weak to taste it?
Not in your life! Let's have it now while we can enjoy it.
Let's die happy.
- What do you think, sir?
- I think a little nip around will do us good.
- Here, you first.
- No, after you.
Carry on.
I got it.
Go on.
Thanks.
Okay, sea, I'm ready for you now.
This would happen to me.
We'll never get back to London now.
I don't know what you're talking about, Tebbitt.
She can't get a train to London till midday tomorrow. So long as we're back by noon...
No, I know the wife.
Of course, blimey, I ought to.
Look, she says here...
If you are not back home tonight
I am going to London.
There is someone there who loves me and who will not leave me alone...
...all the time like you do.
Who is this bloke, have you got any idea?
How should I know, with her living in town and me stuck in camp?
Maybe she only wrote that to put the wind up you.
No, Wilda's always wanted to get back to London.
B1s, B2s, she don't mind.
She misses the pubs, and dance halls, and things like that.
Maybe we'll make it back tonight even yet.
I bet we don't. Even if we do pick up them fellows in the dinghy...
...we'll probably hit a bloody mine or something.
Here, you take over.
- Comfy, Tebbitt?
- That's right.
It's not all right. There's an aircraft over there and it's coming this way in fast.
- Sir, I'd seen it...
- Well, report it, you berk.
Aircraft approaching from starboard.
It's a Sunderland.
Thank you very much!
- What's that, Robby?
- Cocoa.
Give us a cup, will you?
- Any sign of anything yet?
- Nah!
What's up, Flight?
Ah, that Tebbitt.
Drives you up a wall.
He's all right. He's a good boy when it comes to the pick-up.
Oh, sure, they're all good boys when they're on the job.
The problem is keeping them going in between times.
You don't mind that, do you?
You think I like chasing Tebbitt?
It's my job, that's all.
Look at young Milliken.
Do you think I like chasing him?
- He hasn't complain, has he?
- No, he's got guts, all right.
They have to learn the hard way, same as you did.
You were a civilian for the duration, weren't you?
Well, you made it, and so will he.
And the same way.
With punishing flight sergeants chasing from butt holes to breakfast time.
But I was a bit older.
Maybe you were.
But he'll grow old.
I'll see to that.
Oy!
You're the sergeant.
And the sergeant's got to be tough, eh?
That's right.
Ever a Beau Geste.
- How are the engines, baby?
- No complaints.
Bet you're beginning to wish now you hadn't skipped those repairs last night.
Ah, get stuffed, you.
Listen, son.
A damaged oil feed can stop the engines stone dead, and you know it.
All you can do now is hope and be ready.
Ah!
How long is it since we ditched?
About ten hours, I imagine.
Why the hell couldn't look for us in the daylight?
They must be somewhere about.
They can't be far away.
You're the only one who wants to get out of here, bud.
My girlfriend's waiting for me back there.
I reckon in just about an hour
I'll be kissing her good night.
That's all you ever think about, isn't it?
Beer, and girls, and going to the pictures.
Well, I've got other things to think about.
I'm not going to spend the rest of my life in this blasted dinghy.
If the sea gets much rougher, you won't have to worry about that, Mac.
Wait a minute.
Are you all right, Skip?
Yeah, I'm all right.
- A bit stiff.
- A bit stiff.
Here.
Listen, MacKay, and you, Kirby.
If anything should happen to me, this briefcase has got to go overboard, do you understand?
And if we're picked up by an enemy vessel, take the strap of this squawk box, pull it through and tie it tight, and drop it overboard so that it sinks fast.
Did you get that?
Okay, sir.
Is that understood, MacKay?
Why don't you throw it overboard now and have it done with it?
It's brought us only but bad luck.
Listen, MacKay, up to now I haven't reminded you that I have got a certain rank.
When I ask you to do something it's an order.
Did you hear that?
Yes, sir.
Right. We won't talk anymore about the briefcase.
It's about time we did some more exercise. Come on.
It's the damn water we're sitting in.
I've had pins and needles on my behind for the last hour or more.
I can't get rid of it.
Still, if it's just the job for working up an appetite, boy, am I looking forward to my next energy tablet.
- Come on, MacKay!
- Oh, what's the use?
It's a waste of time anyway.
Come on, for goodness' sake.
Do something, stop arguing.
We'll have a song, too.
On and on...
On and on...
Away, pull and tug.
Dear God.
We are four men here... on a pretty tough spot.
I know You've got a lot to think about but... please, try and not forget us.
Our trust is in You.
And if You could possibly see Your way clear getting us somewhere dry, we'd be very grateful.
Amen.
Amen.
Amen.
I say, what's the trouble?
It's nothing, sir.
Come along now, you're not crying for nothing.
Nothing, sir, really.
I say...
You're one of the mess clerks, aren't you?
- Yes, sir.
- Well, can't I help?
- That's what I'm here for, you know.
- Yes, sir, I...
I suppose you haven't heard any news of Mr. Harding's crew, have you, sir?
Oh, I see.
Well, uh...
Look, I was just going to see the Group
Captain, I'll find out what's happening.
Who is it you're interested in?
- Sergeant Kirby, sir.
- Your boyfriend, right?
- We're nearly engaged, sir.
- Jolly good show.
You hang on here and I'll let you know.
- Thank you, sir.
- Think nothing of it.
Come in.
- Good evening, sir.
- Evening, Scotty.
- Sorry to bother you so late, sir.
- Is it important?
- I'm afraid so, sir. Any news of Harding?
- No.
Well, this is about Flight Sgt. MacKay.
He's with Harding, isn't he?
MacKay? What about MacKay?
Well, sir, the station police have found a Jerry kind of petrol in his car, you know, that old Morris he runs about in.
Seems it fell off the back of a motor transport...
...and the police corporal spotted MacKay picking it up after dark.
For sure, sir, fetching petrol is a Court Martial offense.
- Has the corporal reported it?
- Yes.
- That means a charge will be made out.
- Afraid so, sir.
MacKay's a good wireless operator.
He was put in for commission with me.
That's right, sir.
It's all he could do altogether.
What do you feel should be the drill?
There was a sergeant at Fell Borough who took a jerry can of petrol, I remember, in similar circumstances. Stealing by finding, I suppose you'd call it.
That's right, sir. Court Martial and reduced at the ranks.
Then, shortly afterwards he was given his rank back...
...and was eventually killed over Essen.
Oh, was he, sir?
I didn't remember that.
No.
Anyway, nothing much can be done about it until MacKay gets back.
If he gets back.
By the way, sir, about this ensign show on Sunday,
I was wondering if we couldn't possibly...
Roger, sir.
Did you find out, sir?
Oh... yes, my dear.
Well, there's no need to worry.
- They're going to be all right.
- You mean they've found him, sir?
Well, they know where they are.
It's just a matter of time.
- He is all right, isn't he, sir?
- Of course he is.
He'll be on the telephone through the
War Effort before you know where you are.
- Now, you run along and don't worry.
- Thank you, sir.
I've been in touch with the Navy at Dover. sir.
If it gets no worse they think the dinghy will rough the night.
- And if it does get worse?
- I'm not so sure.
I wish we knew where they were.
If they can hold out till daylight, there's still a chance.
We'll get everything that can fly off the ground at first light, unless there's thick fog or heavy rain.
- What's the temperature, Howard?
- Low, sir. Cold and raw.
Possibly some frost on the way.
It could be pretty grim out there.
Could you get a new piece of chalk, corporal?
Sorry, sir.
Oh, Flight! 2559 is around.
I've just picked up a signal.
- They've called airmen to search now.
- Very good. Where is she?
Due north of here.
Well, here we go again.
It'll be the usual, Ryce.
Three tours on the point of a pick-up, and each time fire on us was pitiless.
Next time I'll pull out her bungs and scuttle her.
What's this?
I tied us all... all together.
And that... case...
In case one of us..
...went overboard.
Oh, yeah...
- How's the skip.
- I'm all right, Canada.
How's yourself?
Lousy.
Came the dawn.
Skip, would you like some food?
- No?
- No.
This damn wind...
...taking us closer to the Dutch coast all the time.
Where are they?
It can't take them all this time.
They're...
They're just not trying.
Him and his blasted little bag.
What if he has got Jerry secrets in it?
The war's nearly over now.
Pipe down, Mac.
Whining's not gonna get us anywhere.
Bloody charm we're under...
He... he can't fall himself...
...so he has to take us in the drink too.
Oh, the hell, Mac.
He's a nice enough guy.
What's he doing in the Air Force anyway?
Earning his living?
Not likely.
I know his type.
Constable over his camp... pink gins in the mess...
Mac...
I don't think they served any pink gins in the last six weeks.
Why? Did the mess run out of gin or something?
Did you ever make a parachute jump, Mac?
No.
He did. To get all the stuff that's in that bag.
Made his way through...
...occupied territory for heaven knows...
...how many miles to get it back.
Not so many miles, Harding.
Only about 6 km, actually.
Pretty sticky ones, though.
- What's happened to your boots?
- Hm?
Your boots!
Oh, Skipper's got them on.
He only had shoes on.
How are you feeling?
I'm all right.
I don't feel the cold.
He flew through the air with the greatest of ease
The bold, daring man on the flying trapeze.
He flew through the air with the...
One more leg, Ted, then we head for home.
Set out the course, will you, Ted?
Yep.
Wouldn't like to be in the drink in this weather.
Lord knows I'm fed up with these Sea Otters.
To hell with ditching in a kite that won't float.
Accomplished course 270.
Turning at 5 minutes exact.
Roger dodger.
Listen! Listen!
It's one of ours.
Say, Mac, you'll capsize us.
- Where's the flare?
- I've got it.
Wait a minute, Mac.
Let's see the aircraft first.
- There it is!
- Where?
- I can't see it! Where?
- I can, sir. Over there!
- Have you got the flare ready?
- I can't. I'm too cold.
Hey! We're here!
Here we are!
Hey! Hey!
Hey!
Hurry up, man!
It's a Sea Otter. They're searching for us.
Hurry up with that flare!
- Hurry up, man, for God's sake or we'll miss it.
- It won't come, I can't help it!
- Let me try, here!
It's turning away. It's heading south.
It's too late, I'm afraid.
- We're here! Here we are!
- Hey!
Hey! Hey!
It's no good, fellows.
They can't hear us.
No wonder they didn't spot us.
Why weren't you turning that thing?
I was turning it.
Why didn't they hear us then?
Got a hell of a clout when we ditched.
Maybe it's busted.
You're the wireless operator.
You ought to know.
Knock it off you two.
Quarreling won't help.
Nobody's fault.
They're all the same.
They don't care.
They're warm.
Skipper's passed out.
- Wish we could have found them.
- Me too.
The weather's closing in.
If we don't head for home, we'll be in the drink ourselves.
Come on, you old string bag.
Twenty miles an hour flat out.
The wind and tide behind her.
Bloody taxi driver, that's what I am.
Hey, can you see something down there?
- Huh?
- Look!
- Yeah, it looks like a dinghy.
- I'm going down.
It isn't what we're looking for.
It must be a fighter boy.
I'm going down to pick him up.
Made it!
It's rougher than I thought.
Stand by, Ted.
Johnny, it's a Jerry.
Grab the rope!
Hang on tight!
Come on, you sausage-eating baboon!
Don't panic!
We're getting you!
Danke... danke shoen.
Danke shoen.
I wonder if he's seen anything of the other dinghy.
- Did you see another dinghy? No?
- A dinghy.
- No English. No speak English.
- He doesn't speak English.
Where, what happened?
Who shot you down?
Bomber... attack.
Hudson! Must be the one we're looking for.
- Where was it? Where was it?
- Wo war der Hudson?
He must be the character that shot the Hudson down.
They probably got a pop at him and shot him down too.
Better get him back in the damn tub, too.
Yeah, let's get going.
We haven't any time to waste.
Now we're in trouble.
Someday I'm gonna meet the guy that invented these tripe machines.
Better get busy on the buzzer and contact base and tell them where we are.
Then climb out on the wing and see what the score is, will you?
What about him?
He's in pretty bad shape.
I hope he can hold on until they question him.
I hope so.
Danke.
Danke shoen.
- 59's pretty close now.
- Wonder which is gonna pick up the dinghy.
I bet it's 59. You couldn't pick up a curl in the head.
Hold it!
Yes, that's all right.
Procede... immediately... to assistance... of damaged Sea Otter... tow back to base.
That's due south of here.
Away from the search area.
Oh, now, 61 always gets the dirty jobs.
This boat's got a jinx on it.
Visibility's not so good, Flight.
Still good enough to spot trouble, sir.
See what I see?
Full speed!
Skipper! Sea Otter in the drink by the sound of it, sir.
Signal, sir.
Ahoy, there, 61!
I see they're taking you out of the search.
Well, well, well!
Never mind, you're better off doing an honest job of towing.
They're only using us because we can tow the Sea Otter and search.
- Anyway, good luck with the pick-up.
- Keep your trousers dry.
Head off, Flight.
Head off, aye, sir.
We'll never get back before the train leaves now.
- That's me last chance up the spout.
- That's right, chum, you've had it.
I bet she'll be wearing her new coat.
Ten quid that cost me, you know?
With the gloves in the act.
She's daft about money, dead daft.
She said she wanted it to go with her green suitcase I bought her for Christmas.
I bet she takes that with her, too.
Yeah, and the knives, and the forks, and the family jewels.
That's all right for you to talk, you're not married.
No, and after serving in this lot with you, chum, I'm staying that way.
Phooey! After 20 years of this game
I'm posted to a tug.
- Five-man passengers, that's all.
- Oughtn't to be.
- It's just a ship built at the same time.
- They have a better fitter that we have.
Yes, that's true.
Ah, Skinner!
He should have been a tailor.
Al he's interested in is trousers and skirts.
Weather report, sir.
Gale blowing up.
- Do you think they want me, corporal?
- Damn, get out of the way, can't you?
Skinner!
Oh, there you are. What's up?
- The water pumps are packed up, Flight.
- Water pumps?
Yes, sir, both of them.
The engines are overheating.
There's no water coming through.
How is it that both the water pumps are packed altogether, Skinner?
Well, sir, the keys have sheared.
They have a habit of shearing at awkward moments.
What are you going to do about it then?
- Dismantle the pumps and fit new keys.
- How long will it take?
It'll take about 2 hours, sir.
I'll have to make new keys.
- Haven't you any spare keys?
- That's right.
Not like the boat
I was on before, sir.
The fitter there he made spare keys.
They were in his kit.
Why haven't you?
Why not?
- Well, you see...
- Come on, Skinner, out with it!
Well, sir, it's pretty busy down there with only two of us.
- None of the boats have more than 2 fitters.
- Yes, sir, but...
Skinner, how long did it take you to fix the oil feed last night?
It took me about 3 hours, sir.
I don't believe you took 10 minutes at the most!
- How long did it take you?
- Well, it took me about...
Go on, get back there to make those new keys.
I'll sort you out when we get back.
Hang around.
- Knox.
- Yes, sir?
Send a signal to base.
Tell them we've broken down and we can't pick up the Sea Otter.
Sir.
Pick it up, Skinner!
Go on!
- Pick it up and get on with it!
- But, Flight, it's bleeding.
Lovely!
I'd like to see you bleed slowly to death, master-flaming-corporal Skinner.
Go on, get on with it!
I'll just strip off a bit, Flight, it's pretty hot...
There's no time for stripping off, master-flaming-corporal Skinner!
Maybe you'll sweat to death.
If you do, I'll read the burial service when they push you over the side.
I'll be the first to shout per ardua ad astra as you go down.
And you're gonna be hanging I'll bloody well push you down with a boat hook!
Fire away!
I'll be watching you.
- How's it going, son?
- All right, Flight, it's coming off.
How long's it gonna take?
- A day at this rate.
- All day?
Well, the first sea lord here is gonna be back in a couple of hours.
He'll be lucky.
Thanks, Flight.
Launch on stern quarter, sir.
Ahoy, there, 61!
Broken down again?
Never mind, we're on the job.
We'll find the Sea Otter and tow her in.
Much obliged to you!
You're welcome. And we'll come back for you in the morning if you like.
Very funny, ha-ha.
I'll make a note of where you are in case you're not sure.
Shall I give you your position?
I know where I am, thank you.
You'd better let the Navy know we're here.
If this weather gets worse, we might need help.
We'll probably come back for you ourselves.
Have a good day.
You'll get a medal for this.
He knows what he can do with his blasted medals.
Hold on, 61, I'll pass on your message.
Good luck!
All right, you move along, on the bridge.
All right, Flight.
You'll all end up with double pneumonia this flight, I'm telling you.
Milliken, get me some cocoa.
Well, I've been 20 years in the Marine Corps but I never knew anyone like Skinner.
There's a gale warning out, Flight.
Everybody's been recalled.
And we had to stop here. All because of Master Skinner. Ain't it marvelous?
I keep telling you, kid.
There's no Sergeant Kirby here.
We're keeping beds ready and hot-water bottles...
...but they haven't even found them yet.
From what I heard in the ops room they don't even know where they are.
That can't be true!
Squadron Leader Scott definitely said last night that they'd been found.
He was only saying that to cheer you up.
No, he wasn't. He said they knew where the dinghy was and...
Listen to me. If they had found Kirby or any of them, I'd know, wouldn't I?
Sorry, kid. Keep your chin up.
Excuse me.
I couldn't help overhearing.
I'm afraid Sqn. Ldr. Scott misled you.
He meant well, of course.
- They haven't found them then.
- No.
We've had no luck at all so far.
We're assuming they got into their dinghy safely and that they're still afloat.
But we can only guess at where they are.
- But... in this weather, sir?
- I know.
If it's any help to you,
I still honestly believe...
...there's a chance of their being picked up.
Yes. Thank you, sir.
Here.
Let me help you.
Is he going to die, sir?
Do you think he'll be all right?
I hope so.
Must be...
...nearly midday.
He's a nice fellow, Harding.
You like him, don't you?
He'd so the same for me.
It's...
...just the way he is.
The way... he talks, the bloke.
We've been together nearly two years, sir.
Others have... have come and gone.
But... we seem to have stuck,
I don't know why.
Yes, I know how it is.
His dad's got big estates.
Biggest there are in town.
My father's got fruiters and grocers.
In Luton.
It's mine now.
It's time for his water-foolish son...
...to get back to the shop.
I've got an old bloke looking after it but...
...he doesn't care.
No, it's not the same when it's not your own.
- Did you say Luton?
- Eh?
- Luton.
- Yes, do you know it?
That's funny...
You know, you must know my dad.
Why, did you live there, sir?
What is he, the mayor or something?
No, not exactly.
But he must have punched your ticket at the railway station often enough.
He's a porter there. Or he was, till two years ago when he retired.
Oh.
I used to be mad about trains when I was a kid.
Playing about the railway line all the time...
...watching the numbers of the trains and so on.
But Dad always said no. Fly.
Flying is the thing of the future.
Well, I dropped into the RAF but they wouldn't let me fly.
Eye sight test, you know.
Well, well, I was lucky.
I got a scholarship.
I... I'm an engineer, you know.
Yes... I got back into the RAF again in the end. They wanted me.
Some use to them, I suppose.
So... here I am.
I'll put in for my commission.
Do you think I'll get it?
I don't see why not.
You would, if you knew.
Why?
It's a bit soft telling this to an Air Commodore but...
I pinched a Jerry can of petrol...
...the night before we started out on this lot, and it landed in a ditch.
I've got a little car I bought off a bloke, you know... to go down see the shop now and again.
I just slung it in the back.
If anybody's found it...
I've had it.
If that shop goes bust...
I'm finished.
Yes.
This damn weather, this trouble at home, and you can't get back.
By the way, you'd better consider yourself under close arrest.
Oh...
You know...
He always thought...
...that he'd come and get his groceries from me...
...even if he had to cycle from Gloucestershire.
That's where he lives.
He will, Mac.
So help me, bud, he will.
Where do you think we are now, Kirby?
Somewhere off the coast of Belgium,
I reckon, sir.
There's a chance we may be washed up on...
...enemy territory then.
Well, at least he'd be safe and warm in hospital.
How's your hand, Mac?
Can't even feel it, sir.
That reminds me.
Time we had another ration.
See if you can reach that thing and...
...chuck it over, will you?
If I can.
With the other hand.
Thanks.
Do you think that...
...Sea Otter will...
...ever come back again?
Not exactly flying weather, is it?
Not ideal.
What about the air-sea rescue?
As my old grandma used to say...
Patient, ever patient, enjoy, so be thy share.
- Got it?
- Thank you, sir.
Oh, God!
I hate the bloody sea!
Is that the dinghy?
According to the Navy, yes, sir.
They've questioned that German pilot they brought in pretty closely, and allowing for wind and the tide, that's about it, sir.
- As close in as that.
- As close in as that.
If she's still afloat.
The Navy says she'll be right by the beach this evening...
...in occupied territory.
- Are both our launches still out of it?
- Yes, sir.
2559 is due at any time now with the Sea Otter.
2561 I reckon will be able to operate in a couple of hours.
Look!
Look what's happened to my best jacket.
Look at it! Look what's happened to my best jacket.
- Look what's happened.
- Good!
Nothing like a spot of oil for a two-bit, Skinner.
You'll have to get it off.
Got to wash it, like I do.
Maybe it'll keep you in at nights.
Go on, keep firing.
- What are you doing, bosseye?
- Yes, Flight.
The big swan wants his head examined.
How long is this likely to last?
Robbie seems to think we won't get the full force of the gale.
We're somewhere on the edge of it.
What do you think, Timmy?
Maybe I should have walloped her, given her what for, showed her who was boss.
No, that good-for-no-good, she'd just gone off sooner, wouldn't she, eh?
Well, what do you think, Gusser?
I'll tell you what I think, chum.
Somewhere out there there's four blokes in a dinghy.
They've been out there all night.
And if they're not dead already, they're sitting out there depending upon you and me to go and find them.
So if you don't stop whining about that silly wife of yours,
I'm gonna pick you up and chuck you right over the side, personally.
All right, all right, I was only asking.
Come on, it's time you and I go on watch.
Milliken, put the kettle on.
Robbins will be down in a minute, he'll want a cup of tea.
Okay, corporal, Tobey's in the way.
He asked for Flight.
Okay.
Do you think we'll be back before dark, Flight?
What's the matter? Can't you sleep without a night light?
What about the skipper?
- Going to Gosport.
- Yes...
Ever been to Gosport?
- No.
- I have.
I was stationed there in the old days.
Yeah, we've gone a long way since then.
And what have we got?
We've got radar, wireless, loops, launches with vast engines and patent logs.
With that and a fishing crew you're up a well-known creek.
Excuse me. I think I've set the boat on fire.
Fire!
Get down below!
It's all over here, sir.
- Where is he?
- Check the upper deck, the cabin.
- Aye, aye, sir.
- This is a fine bloody mess.
Who's responsible for this?
I am, sir.
Flt. Sgt., I want the full facts before we get back.
Milliken...
They'll probably shoot you for this.
But I was only trying to put the kettle on for a cup of tea.
If they don't shoot you, you'll be paying for this boat for the rest of your life.
Keep out of my way till we get back.
Now get up top.
You're doing bridge watch.
- Bridge watch, what's that?
- Keeping your silly eyes open, that's all.
You keep sitting on your old mat all day. Go, get up there!
Tobey, you follow him.
- Don't take your eyes off him.
- Okay, Flight.
- Well done, Tebbit.
- Thanks, very much.
- Clear this muck up.
- That's gonna take hours!
We've got all day!
I shouldn't have cared if we all blowed up.
What have I got to live for?
Hey! Come on, Guy Fawkes.
- How are you feeling now?
- Like death.
Why don't you sit in the wheel house?
I'll stand your watch for you.
Thanks, Corp, but I think I'd better stay here.
I'm not very popular with the Flight
Sergeant at the moment.
All I did was put a match to it and it blew up in my face.
Oh, forget it.
I know it was an accident.
The Flt. Sgt. doesn't think so.
- He's a bit of a terror, isn't he?
- He's gotta be.
After all, the Flight Sergeant's got to be tough.
He's all right.
You watch him if you run into any trouble. You'll see.
Hey, skipper.
Kraut firing ahead!
Launches.
Yeah.
And more than one by the sound of it.
I heard them.
And the firing, too.
You'll get a bloody medal, you will.
- They're due east of us, sir.
- And they're not HSLs.
You bet your life they're not.
They're right in the middle of eboat tally here.
I suppose they couldn't be
Navy boats, could they?
Yeah, they could.
But not our Navy.
The enemy.
I hope they don't run into us before
Skinner gets his engines going again.
We've got to make this pick-up.
All right, you bunch of heroes, get back to your holes... we're not dead yet.
Did you hear that?
There's firing.
Canada!
Canada! They've come, they've come!
Hold...
Hold the flare, Mac.
Let's see them first.
They might be Jerries.
Why should they be?
They must be ours.
They must.
Hear that?
But they... they must be our chaps.
They must...
Testing their guns around here?
No, they're Jerries all right.
That means we must have drifted south faster than we expected.
Yes, sir.
My guess is we're... we're somewhere off the mouth of the Scheldt.
How far off, do you think?
Well, unless... the wind changes...
...or the tide...
...we'll be inshore before nightfall.
Right under the nose of their shore batteries.
That washes out any chance of a rescue.
- There they are.
- Where?
There.
Two of them, see?
I... I knew it.
They're Jerries.
- What do we do now, sir?
- Wait.
Wait?
We're not going to give up ourselves now.
We'll be on the beach by nightfall.
You said so.
And Skipper... it'll be too late.
They may not have seen us yet.
There's still a chance of a rescue.
What's so good of being rescued if he's dead?
He's had as much as he can take.
We all have.
Haven't you got any pity?
Look at him.
He's dying, I tell you!
He's dying!
I've got to get this case back to England even if we all die.
There's just a chance they may be looking for us.
- For us, sir?
- Or this case.
They've passed us by.
No!
What are you up to, man?
For God's sake, man, what are you doing?
MacKay, MacKay, let go.
Give me that!
Give it!
- I'm gonna do it!
I'm gonna...
- It's time. It's time!
- MacKay, listen to me!
Millions of lives are... Listen!
There are millions of lives that we can save...
...if I can only get this case of mine back home.
Come on, Mac.
For God's sake, believe me, man.
He's right, you know, Mac.
Excuse me, sir.
You'll excuse me speaking to you, you're Group Commander Todd, aren't you?
- Yes.
- I've seen you at the dances.
- Oh, I'm uh...
- I'm Mrs. Tebbitt.
Oh, Mrs. Tebbitt.
- Yes.
My husband was due back from patrol last night and he hasn't turned up.
- What launch is he in?
Are you planning to catch this train?
Yes.
Yes, I am. I'm going to London.
- At least I...
- Mrs. Tebbitt.
There are four men down in a dinghy.
They're somewhere in the North Sea.
About their only chance now is for launch 2561 to find them.
Oh.
Excuse me. I've got to break the news to someone.
- Hello, Chris, dear.
- Hello, Eve.
How nice of you to come and meet me.
- Where's Clive?
- He's not here. Eve.
Don't tell me I've come all this way...
What is it, Chris?
Has something happened?
I'm afraid Clive's missing, Eve.
The aircraft he was traveling back in yesterday morning failed to arrive.
There's a crew of three with him.
We believe they're in a dinghy.
Dinghy?
Message from headquarters, sir.
Must be highly secret. I can't decode it.
Flight.
Aye, aye.
- Congratulations, sir.
- Thanks, Flight.
I told you that coat would fit a boy.
- Any reply, sir.
- Yes, send a signal.
When do the new childs allow us to start?
When do the new childs allow us to start?
I hope we get back soon, Flight.
It's gone 2 o'clock. That's me lot.
She's left me.
Here... you don't have it, you know.
Well, I did.
She's on her way to London by now.
I shall never see her again.
And a damn good job, too,
'cause I'm jolly well sick of her.
- Where's the captain.
- On the bridge with Chiefy.
- Well, they're all right. We can start.
- The engines are okay?
- I said we can start.
- Right.
- Engines are ready, sir.
- Good, and about time, too.
All right, start them up.
Marshall, send the signal to base.
- We're ready to continue the search.
- Very good, sir.
Blythe, go ahead all speed,
1000 revs.
Come in.
Well, Scotty, what is it this time?
- I thought you'd want to see this, sir.
- What is it?
It's a charge sheet made out against Flt. Sgt. MacKay.
- You haven't wasted much time.
- No, sir.
- Any news of the dinghy?
- No, there isn't.
Did all you could do, sir.
I suppose this will have to go through.
But if he comes ashore alive, he will be dealt with lightly, or I'll know the reason why.
Yes, sir. Still it's jolly unpatriotic, you know. I mean, pinching petrol...
- Don't behave like a club man!
- Yes, sir... Very good.
- Oh, one thing more.
- Yes, sir?
This little WAF, Sgt. Kirby's,
I gather you told her last night...
- ...he was safe and on his way back.
- I was trying to cheer her up.
She's only a child, you know.
She didn't behave like a child when I told her the facts.
Sorry, sir.
I seem to make rather a muck of things all around.
Come in.
Signal from 2561, sir.
- They're ready to resume the search.
- Right, I'll come.
- May I talk to you of the dance on Sunday, sir?
- No.
- Oh, no news yet, I'm afraid.
- Thank you, sir.
Where do you reckon the dinghy should be now?
Just about here, sir.
- Right in close to enemy shore.
- Forecast for that area is mist lifting rapidly.
It means the Jerries are bound to spot them.
Yes...
How long would it take 2561 to get to that position?
About an hour, sir.
45 minutes, maybe.
Right. Signal them to make an in-shore search in that area.
Yes, sir.
It's a devil of a place for a launch to go right out to the shore batteries.
- That is not all of it, sir.
- Hm? What else?
This is an enemy mine field.
I think it's about time we did some exercises again, huh?
- Land!
- Where?
- I saw land.
- Huh?
I saw land over there.
- Look, there it is.
- Where?
- See it?
- Yes, I can see it now that the mist is lifting.
Houses.
Real houses.
Well... we're close in.
Belgian coast.
South of Antwerp.
That'll be nice.
Right in Jerry's lap.
Listen!
It's only waves.
No, it sounded louder than that.
It's a sand bank.
We're inside it.
If it dries out at low tide... they'll be able to walk out and pick us up.
At least you'll be all right.
All I've got to look forward to is a court martial.
If we can get this briefcase back to England safely... you'll find it'll weigh more than a Jerry can of petrol.
Well, if anyone wants to pick us up now...
...they'll have plenty of fun.
- Will you make us some tea, Knox?
- Tea? Hot-water bottles in case of shock.
- Oughtn't I to do that?
- You did enough damage last time.
You get up on deck and keep your eyes open.
The shore's only over there through the mist.
We've got just about enough petrol to get us out.
Keep searching.
Aye, sir.
Thank goodness for this mist.
At least they can't see us from the shore.
A launch.
- A launch, they've found us.
- Where, man, where?
Over there.
I saw it for a second, then...
Then it disappeared.
- It's nothing.
- I tell you I saw a launch.
Air-sea rescuer, or I'm crazy.
Get the flare out, will you?
Make sure that it works this time.
Come on, where is it?
There!
There she is.
- Shout!
- Hey!
- For God's sake, shout!
- Hey! Hey!
It's no good attracting mensches at that distance
Get the flare out, Mac, go on!
Hey...Hey...
- I can't. You... you do...
The whistle!
Blow the whistle, Mac.
The mist is lifting.
It's a bit disappointing though, coming all this way without making the pick-up.
Blarmey, Tebbitt, you're human after all.
Thanks very much, Flight.
Flare, Flare!
Flight, a red flare.
Sir, a red flare over there!
That's all, hold it.
- There she is, sir!
- It's a dinghy, sir! It's a dinghy!
Stand by to pick-up!
On posts! Keep your eyes keen everybody.
The shore's somewhere over there.
Come on, get below, Milliken.
You've got work to do, come on.
She's coming.
She's coming towards us.
Shout, boys.
Shout like hell.
Hey! Hey!
- Hey!
- Hey!
We go uptide to the south side of the sand bank and come out the other end.
Aye, aye, sir.
Skinner, up on deck!
Let's have all of you up on deck!
We may need you.
Full speed ahead on all three.
- They've seen us, Flight!
- Here it comes!
Pretty rotten shots, aren't they?
Any menace they all start up.
One more like that, that's all we want, just one more like that.
Come on, hurry up!
Get a move on.
All together!
Right, lift!
Steady as you go!
- Are you all right, sir?
Don't worry about me, watch the dinghy.
We've got do this damn quickly.
Take the wheel.
You'll be all right, chums.
You'll be on board a train in a minute.
- Hey, Tebbitt!
- All right, sir.
Try to get a move on.
- I got it. Watch out chap.
- Okay, get her away!
Head off!
Hold your breath, boy!
We did it!
We bloody well did it!
Tebbitt!
- You all right?
- They must have chucked the gun at me.
- I'll get you an order to sick bay.
- And an all clear, Flight.
All clear?
Do you hear that noise?
The sweetest music in the world.
The engines making for home.
How are you, Clive?
- Hello, Chris.
- It's good to see you.
Good luck, sir.
- Thanks. Come see me later.
- I will, sir.
Okay, now?
Yes.
You?
Fine.
See you later.
Thank you, Treherne.
You did a great job.
The doctor said you'll be on your feet in a matter of weeks.
That'll suit me fine, sir.
Have a nice stretch of convalescence leave.
Give you time to get to know your son.
I'd like that, sir.
Congratulations.
Thank you all very much.
Thank you, sir.
- Well, how do you feel?
- Oh, I'll be fine in a couple of days.
I'm glad Eve took it so well.
Oh, by the way, I wanted to talk to you sometime about that Flt. Sgt. MacKay.
Funny you should mention that.
I wanted to talk to you about him.
How's Flight Officer Harding?
Oh, he'll be okay, Sergeant.
We got him just in time.
- How was it?
- Oh, a bit dodgy.
But we held them off, you know?
Here, Milliken!
A fag?
Oh, thanks, Flight.
I thought you did a favor to us all.
You made a pick-up.
You're one of God's chosen few.
Enjoy the trip?
I never thought we'd get back.
Get back? Get back?
After a pick up like that I'd have swum under the basket and carried her home.
I bet you would, Flight.
Now come on, son, don't keep the ambulance waiting. You're wounded, aren't you?
Oh, it's nothing. I feel a bit hungry.
I thought I'd go down to the cookhouse.
All them WAFs!
Come on, Robbie.
Subtitles: Luís Filipe Bernardes
Since the first revelation of the atom bomb at Hiroshima in 1945... the United States, England and Russia... have been experimenting with more and more increasingly deadly weapons.
Every day, there is more concentration on the race for atom supremacy.
Sometimes machines and men, such as Carl Noymann... are driven beyond the line of endurance.
And when that happens...
In Washington, the accident became the subject of an intense discussion... by high-ranking officials.
Dr. Penner, science is your business.
Protecting this country is mine.
You say we should call an immediate end to nuclear experimentation.
- But you know that's impossible.
- Then limit it to experiments for peace.
We've been over all this before.
After what happened,
I thought you might think differently.
That's why I flew here.
General, since I can't change your mind...
I am resigning from the Commission.
- I want nothing more to do with the project.
- You're being panicked by one incident.
Panicked? The area around Dr. Noymann's laboratory won't be livable for years.
Every test made since the explosion yesterday... shows pollution of our atmosphere, the air we breathe.
Every precaution is being taken to protect the people in that district.
- Decontamination crews are...
- Are what?
Cleansing the air?
Straining it, as you would dirty water?
Radioactive particles have been blown into space.
Who can tell when those particles will come down to Earth again?
You don't even know what lasting effect... they might have on the space around the Earth.
Dr. Penner, please reconsider.
The Commission can't afford to lose its top man.
Sorry, but I think my attitude now... would be more of a hindrance than a help to the Commission.
I'm going to fly home in time for Carl Noymann's funeral... and I'm not coming back to Washington.
Goodbye, General.
Carl Noymann and I were friends since childhood.
We grew to manhood sharing the same goal.
Science for the benefit of humanity.
Somewhere, our ideals were lost... and Carl Noymann died because of it.
A deadly weapon he was helping to create killed him.
But Carl Noymann hasn't died in vain.
His death has served a purpose... to bring me back to my senses.
I've found again the ideals
Carl and I once had.
From now on, my work will be devoted to the aid of humanity... not its destruction.
I have made my pledge to you, Carl.
May God rest your soul.
- How is he?
- Asleep. He's exhausted.
I'm sorry your father resigned from the Commission.
It puts us on opposite sides of the fence.
It's become an obsession with him.
I hope he gets over it.
I'm sure he will.
I'd better get some sleep.
I have to catch an early plane back to
Washington the first thing in the morning.
It's good seeing you again, Phyllis.
It's been a long time, John.
- I'll drive you downtown.
- Wonderful.
I'm glad you could fly in for the funeral.
I know Dad appreciates it.
I'll call and see how he is before I leave in the morning.
Carl!
Adam Penner, you will listen carefully.
You can't be Carl. You can't be.
No.
This is the corpse of an Earthman who was known as Carl Noymann.
Earthman?
I am from another planet, outside your galaxy.
I'm sorry. I just don't understand.
Adam Penner, you can save the people of Earth from total destruction.
Unless Earth surrenders in 24 hours, we will begin a mass invasion.
This is fantastic.
You expect me to believe that you can overrun the entire world?
Your scientists think that the moon is a dead planet.
That it is uninhabited. It is not.
You're a madman. We know it is.
More than 20,000 years ago, my planet invaded the moon... and destroyed the life that existed there.
We have controlled the moon since then... and made it an impregnable base for our spaceships.
- We'd have seen signs of life there.
- You would see nothing.
We are invisible.
We are invisible, Adam Penner.
Long ago we learned to change the molecular structure of our bodies.
You cannot see us.
I am using this dead man's body so that I can communicate with you.
Why do you want us to surrender?
What do you want of Earth?
We have studied your languages and your many civilizations... for thousands of years.
We have never bothered Earth because of its slow scientific development.
But now you are approaching the Space Age.
You are testing nuclear and rocket devices for travel into space.
As we have put the moon and many other planets under our rule... it is now time for us to put Earth under our rule.
Dictatorship of the universe!
We cannot be defeated.
We have never been defeated.
Just as I have done with the dead body of Carl Noymann... my people will come to your planet... and inhabit the bodies of other dead Earthmen.
The dead will kill the living.
And the people of Earth will cease to exist.
That is the message you will bring your people.
Why me? Why did you choose me?
Your voice has been the loudest for peace.
You have demanded that the nations... stop the manufacture of nuclear weapons for war.
Adam Penner, if you want peace... you will tell your people to surrender now and avoid war.
They'll never surrender. They'll fight.
As fast as you can land your spaceships here, they'll destroy them.
Hold out your hand.
What is it?
The material from which our spaceships are constructed.
We have made everything on our planet invisible.
- That sound...
- Look closely.
You are holding the material from which we build our ships.
Without this device, you cannot see it.
Now that you know you cannot find our ships to destroy them... you will bring the message to your people.
They won't listen. Nobody will believe me.
You have had your warning.
- John, please be patient with him.
- Of course.
I know that this won't interfere with your plans to return to Washington.
We'll see. Besides, it gives me a little more time to see you.
When I came home and found that he actually believed that fantastic story...
- I had to turn to someone.
- I'm glad you came back to the hotel for me.
I'm sure all he needs is a little rest.
Dad.
- You brought John back?
- Yes, I'm here, Adam.
- Phyllis told you about it?
- Yes.
This has to be just something in your mind.
A nightmare. You know that, don't you?
The corpse of Carl Noymann was in this room.
- It was no nightmare.
- Oh, Dad.
And I'm not insane, Phyllis.
I'm not having a breakdown.
Try to understand. There's no time to argue.
Don't ask me to get proof.
I can't explain what happened tonight.
I'm not going to try. All I know is... that we're all just 24 hours away from destruction.
Adam, in heaven's name!
Phyllis told me that you want me to go to Washington... to alert them about this crazy idea.
You must!
Do you expect them to believe such a thing?
Not from me, not after the things
I've said to them about the nuclear tests.
- But they might believe you.
- You're asking me to make a fool of myself.
In 24 hours, John, you might not be alive... to enjoy that precious career of yours.
Please, John?
Adam, I owe you a great deal.
Everything I know, you taught me.
I don't want to do this, for both our sakes.
But, if that's what you want,
I'll go to Washington... and tell them what you said.
Then hurry. Every hour counts.
Now make them realize that.
I'll be in Washington in a few hours.
I'll try, that's all I can promise.
Goodbye, Phyllis.
If Carl had only left me some proof, something to convince them...
Dear Lord, I pray that I am insane... that all that happened is only in my mind.
I pray that tomorrow the sun will shine again on living things.
Not on a world where only the dead walk the Earth.
- Well, John?
- I see you've read the papers, Adam.
Wasn't there anyone who'd listen to you?
He tried, Dad. John really did try.
All you've succeeded in doing is making laughing stocks out of both of us.
I hope you're satisfied.
I want to believe that I'm out of my mind,
John, but I can't.
You've been with me all day, hon.
Was I rational?
Yes.
He was, John, every minute.
I'd know. He's not sick.
I don't know what to say, Phyllis.
At 11:30, the 24 hours will be up.
We need time.
They must give it to us. They must.
You honestly believe you can contact these... invisible things again?
I don't know. But we have to try.
Where? How, Dad?
The one I talked to was using
Carl Noymann's body.
- Perhaps if we go to the cemetery...
- Adam!
We've nothing to lose, John. Please.
Like I told you, he's not sick.
I'll drive.
If you are here, if you can see me... or hear me... please, I must talk to you.
I beg you, I plead with you, in the name of humanity... please, let me have this one chance to speak.
Speak, Adam Penner.
I tried to do what you wanted.
You failed, Adam Penner.
No one would listen. We must have time.
Please, give me time to try again.
Your voice is not enough.
You are alone, Adam Penner.
You cannot succeed.
But the people of Earth will have one more warning.
How? What will you do?
One more warning. That is all.
Listen.
I don't hear anything.
That rasping sound, the breathing.
It's stopped. They're gone.
What do you believe now, John?
What can we do? What can we possibly do?
Nothing.
The warning will come.
Then it'll be up to the world.
It's out of our hands.
The first warning came in the wake of a fatal air crash... outside Syracuse, New York.
The pilot had been killed.
But, within minutes, his lifeless body was inhabited... by one of the invisible invaders.
Girard back to Fontaine. Fontaine shoots.
The puck is deflected.
It hits the cage and goes off to one side.
The invader, using the pilot's body... had come to issue the first public threat to the people of Earth.
Icing is called. They'll have to bring the puck all the way back to Rover ice.
People of Earth, this is your last warning.
Unless the nations of your planet surrender immediately... all human life will be destroyed in a war you cannot win.
The invader, finished with the corpse... left it and again became invisible.
The second warning came in California.
People of Earth... this is your last warning.
Unless the nations of your planet... surrender immediately... all human lives will be destroyed.
And the entire world has felt the shock of sudden and very strange warnings... delivered by some sort of invisible life from another planet.
At this very moment, every capital in the world... has called an emergency meeting to discuss a unified defense of the Earth.
Apparently, there is no indication that any of the nations intend to surrender... as demanded by the invaders.
People of Earth, our warnings have been ignored.
The invasion of Earth has started.
Within three days... the dead will destroy all the living and we will rule the earth.
For the human race, this is the end of existence.
By late that same afternoon, the invaders had instigated... a worldwide reign of terror with sabotage.
Buildings and industrial plants were hit by explosions.
Large dams in the United States, Holland...
Finland and Russia were blown up... flooding the areas around them, inundating towns and cities... killing thousands.
Bridges leading to key military installations were destroyed... stopping all traffic to these vital centers.
Throughout the entire world, the dead are leaving cemeteries... to attack the living.
Walking dead who kill, but cannot be killed.
Horror, fear and panic have turned the civilized peoples of the Earth... into howling mobs.
It is impossible to estimate the death toll... since many of our news headquarters in other nations have been destroyed.
Just a moment.
We have a bulletin from Washington.
Dr. Adam Penner has again taken charge of the Atom Commission.
He and other top scientists are being sent to laboratories in underground bunkers... throughout the United States, where they will try to find... methods of fighting the invasion of the invisible enemy.
Well, that must be John now.
- I was afraid you weren't going to make it.
- We just about did.
- Miss Penner, Major Jay.
- How do you do?
The Pentagon had assigned
Major Bruce Jay, of the Air Force... to escort the group to one of the underground bunkers...
27 miles outside of town.
The news said there was fighting in the Lawnhurst area.
- Bunker 4's been cut off.
- We'll try Number 6.
- Can't we stop them at all?
- They're sabotaging large installations.
- It's our job to find some sort of weapon.
- What about the others on the Commission?
27 scientists have been moved to other underground bunkers.
They'll be working on this project, also.
Here, can I help you?
All right, hang on.
Maj. Jay, who had been briefed thoroughly... in the operation of the complex underground bunkers... was to afford whatever protection he could for the scientists.
The walking dead were everywhere now.
A vast army of destruction that could not be killed.
Just keep your hands up where I can see them.
I got no way of getting out of this part of the country, except on foot.
- I want that jeep you're driving.
- This is an official mission. Get off the road.
You think you're better than I am?
You think you got a right to live, and I ain't?
I seen them walking dead things.
I seen them.
Joe Anderson and his wife drowned two weeks ago.
Now walking through the fields again.
Walking and killing.
I'll give you three to get out of that car, then I'm shooting. One!
All right, get out.
Don't do anything to make him nervous.
He's out of his head.
- What are you gonna do?
- Just get out.
Two!
You killed him.
Maybe you've got some answers this country needs.
Anyway, we're only a few miles from the bunker.
I wasn't going to let him stop us.
Everybody get back in the jeep.
I said get back in the jeep!
The jeep arrived without further incident at the camouflaged entrance... of Bunker Number 6, which had been built to be bombproof... in the event of an all-out atom-bomb war.
The control panel's over there, everything's marked.
Shut the door. I'll meet you in the lab.
Able Fox Niner Six on May Day Channel 1.
Calling May Day Homer.
This is Able Fox Niner Six. Over.
May Day Homer to Able Fox Niner Six.
Just a moment, sir. Gen. Stone?
- It's Major Jay, on Number Six.
- Then he got through all right?
Yes. Maj. Jay, Dr. Lamont,
Prof. Penner and his daughter.
Good.
Major Jay, listen carefully, all of you.
A worldwide state of extreme emergency exists.
The federal government has been evacuated from Washington.
Total military and scientific mobilization has been ordered.
Attempts to negotiate with the invaders have proven hopeless.
Continuing efforts by the military to destroy the invaders have failed.
Hold on, General, be right with you.
Remote Geiger counter shows high radioactivity outside.
All of you, turn off those white switches, quick.
We're all right now.
Those switches hermetically seal the bunker.
Make it bombproof, safe from almost anything.
But why the high radioactivity outside?
We'd hear, or at least feel, any nuclear explosion... close enough to give a reading like that.
The radioactivity isn't constant.
It goes up and down.
Cyclic pulsation?
Doesn't make any sense at all.
As if the wind were blowing radioactivity in, then out, then in?
Or a line of something going past one at a time.
- We better take a look.
- Look?
Closed-circuit TV wasn't affected by the jamming.
They've found us.
No, not yet they haven't. But they're looking.
And that's the reason why.
The walking dead, inhabited by the invisible enemy... had left their spaceship nearby to search for the scientists.
So far, it looks like they don't know the bunker's here.
You were right.
The invaders occupying those dead bodies are highly radioactive.
Able Fox Niner Six to May Day Homer. Over.
- What happened?
- Invaders outside the bunker looking for us.
We picked them up with the Geiger counters.
We've already discovered they're highly radioactive.
Unfortunately, we can't give you any help.
No one's been able to come up with a clue to stop the invaders.
We don't know how you're going to do the job... but you must find some weapon to stop the invaders.
You'll use May Day S.O.X. for your reports.
Good luck to you.
Good luck to all of us. Over and out.
Roger Wilco. Over and out.
Well, you heard him. Any ideas?
Every scientist in the world must be working on this.
How do they expect us to hold out long enough in this prison?
Those things out there are breathing down our necks.
We're all scared, Dr. Lamont.
You're not alone.
Sorry. When I saw that farmer you killed walking past the bunker...
I don't see any point of your being insulting about it.
I'm in charge of this outfit.
We've got a job to do, and we're gonna do it, now.
I'm sure that Dr. Lamont and my father realize that.
Since this started,
I've seen a lot of men crack up mentally... like that farmer out there, but we need you.
You can't afford the luxury of cracking up.
John, the Major is right.
We're all gonna need sleep by tonight.
The work can't stop, so we'll have to sleep in four-hour shifts.
- Agreed?
- Agreed.
- You gonna need your daughter?
- Not until she has to take some notes for us.
All right.
You'll find everything you need here.
If it isn't here, it doesn't exist.
Miss Penner, you'll help me with the supplies.
Meanwhile, the sabotage by the invaders... went on in ever-increasing fury.
Government buildings, communications units... warehouses, army supply depots... railroad and air terminals were the victims of incendiaries... completely demoralizing the high commands... of the armed services of every nation in the world.
May Day Homer to Able Fox Niner Six.
This is Able Fox Niner Six.
Major Jay. Over.
Major, Gen. Stone. Is Dr. Penner there?
Yes, sir. Right next to me.
We can't hold out here much longer.
Any progress there?
Nothing definite, sir.
Maybe this will be of some help.
We've been able to establish a definite pattern.
The invaders either have no weapons of their own, which is unlikely... or the ones they do have won't work in our atmosphere.
General, this is Dr. Penner.
What about the sabotage, the explosions, the fires?
All created by our own weapons against us.
Then their only weapon, actually, is the fact that they're invisible.
That's right. Dr. Harkov, in Moscow, believes there must be a weakness... in the molecular structure of their basic materials... their metals, in Earth's atmosphere.
It might also indicate a weakness in the molecular structure of their bodies.
Thanks, General. This might help.
We'll report back in two hours, sir.
- Right.
- Over and out.
Shall I wake up Lamont and your daughter?
Not yet. They've only had a little over an hour's rest.
I want to work on this new aspect alone for a while.
Dr. Penner... do you still feel the same way about the testing of nuclear weapons?
Yes, Major, I think I do.
If the Lord wills it, we'll come out of this alive.
Then, perhaps, the nations of the world will realize it's possible to work together... as they're doing now... instead of trying to destroy each other with nuclear bombs.
You didn't sleep much.
I thought I heard the radio.
Gen. Stone had something for us.
- Your father thought it might be a lead.
- Can I help?
He wants to work on it alone.
You hate my guts, don't you?
You killed a man in cold blood this morning.
I keep seeing his face.
So do I.
I fought all the way through Korea.
Probably killed a lot of men.
But I never saw their faces.
Dropping a bomb from a plane isn't quite so personal.
Can I make you some coffee?
No, thanks. I've had enough already.
It was either your father or the man with the shotgun.
I had to make a choice.
Perhaps I was wrong about John, too.
What about?
The way you insulted him.
You had to make that choice, too.
Well, he was going off the deep end.
It worked, didn't it?
At least, it was better than slugging him.
I majored in Psychology at college... but I'll take a few lessons from you, Major.
Yeah, sure.
If there's anything left of this world after we get out of here, we'll talk about it.
About Lamont, you two majoring in each other?
Lamont and I...
Phyll.
Get John for me, please. Hurry.
Find something?
I'm not sure it'll work.
It's going to take some courage to find out.
Major, one of us will have to leave the bunker.
What is it, Adam?
I told you of the device used by the invader who contacted me.
- The thing that made the metal ore visible.
- Yes.
Since this morning, I've been working on the theory that the device... may have projected a ray of some sort.
Now, only two theories seem to make any sense.
That the ray changed the light spectrum, or that it temporarily changed... the molecular structure of the ore itself.
Dr. Penner.
You said one of us would have to leave the bunker.
- Why?
- I'm getting to that, Major.
Before I can test either of the theories... we'll have to capture one of the invaders to test it on.
- That's a pretty tall order.
- We have no choice.
We'll have to bring one of the creatures into the bunker.
How can you possibly capture something you can't see?
There's a fire-foam spray among our equipment.
Can you convert it to handle an acrylic spray?
Acrylic spray?
A liquid plastic mixed with a catalyst that... covers and solidifies on contact, forms a hard shell.
The stuff used to mothball
Navy equipment and tanks.
If I can convert the gun, then what?
I believe... the invisible creatures enter a dead body through the pores of the skin.
Sort of an osmosis process.
And the acrylic spray will seal the body so the invader can't get out?
It's only a theory. I said it might not work.
We can't take this chance.
One of them might escape in the bunker.
None of us would be safe.
Maybe there's another way.
Maybe there's something else...
If there is another way, we haven't got time.
Dr. Penner, you get on with the spray.
I'll try and convert the gun.
Phyllis.
They've no right to put you in such danger.
Haven't they, John?
By 11:30 of the first night... the nations of Earth were close to total defeat.
All through the night,
Dr. Penner and Dr. Lamont... labored to manufacture the acrylic formula.
Meanwhile, Major Jay, with the help of Phyllis Penner... converted the fire-foam gun so that it could use the liquid plastic.
By dawn, they had succeeded.
Remember, if I don't make it, you'll have to try again.
They won't quit now.
You asked about John and me.
We're just old friends. That's all.
I'm glad I asked.
All clear.
All clear.
Okay, open the door.
There's enough radiation out there to kill you. Please be careful.
This suit's tough. I'll be all right.
The Geiger counter. Something's coming.
- He got him.
- Wait.
He didn't finish the spray.
No!
We can use the truck to get to him.
Look.
He's leaving.
If he gets far enough away, we won't need the truck.
Now!
Thanks. I'm all right.
The spray gun won't work.
It's not fast enough.
However, I still think the acrylic spray is the answer.
When I hit the body with it, the invader took off fast.
- He was afraid of it.
- But how can we use it?
Well, that depends on Lamont's nerves.
Major, you've been trying...
All right, all right, take it easy. Relax.
I need your help. I'm asking for it.
My life will be in your hands, and I don't want to go into this thing with... two strikes against me.
- What do you want me to do now?
- I'll tell you in a minute.
Dr. Penner, can you make up a large amount of this spray?
- We might.
- All right.
We're gonna have to move fast now, after what's happened.
Have any of you wondered why I wasn't killed by that invader?
You said the invader was frightened by the spray.
That's right.
The spray was more important than I was.
He probably went back to his spaceship... to report we were getting close to something that might bother them.
Now they'll double their forces to find our bunker and knock it out.
It will also mean the entire area around here will be filled with them.
That's why only two of us will leave.
Phyllis and Dr. Penner will stay here.
If we're not back, there'll be someone left to keep working.
- There's only one radiation suit.
- That's all we need.
You'll stay in the cab of the truck.
It's protected.
As you say.
All right, let's get busy on the spray.
I'll explain what I have in mind.
Knowing the invader's spaceship must be in the area...
Major Jay chose a likely spot to set his trap for catching one of the enemy.
Okay, this looks like the spot.
They're around here, but not too close.
Remember, don't get out of the truck.
I understand.
Major, there's one thing you haven't said.
Yeah?
You're actually making yourself the bait in a trap to catch one of the creatures.
Know a better way to go fishing?
No, I don't.
All right, stay with that Geiger counter.
In case I get company, signal with that horn, and fast.
One long, one short.
A deep hole had been dug.
And now it was being filled with the acrylic liquid.
The next step was to set a noose beneath the liquid... for once the acrylic hardened... the encased corpse would have enormous weight.
The plan now was to lure one of the walking dead into the area... where the pit had been dug.
A direct attack by Major Jay was the quickest... though the most dangerous, method of baiting the invader.
- They're coming, get ready.
- All right, Dad.
- You okay?
- I'm okay.
Get your father,
I want to get this into the chamber.
Major Jay!
They're all around us.
I saw them on the monitors.
They probably followed the truck.
They're trying to smash down the door.
Take it easy.
This place is built to stand an atom blast.
Come on, help me.
Are you sure the pressure will crack that stuff on the body?
It can crush anything not built to withstand it.
All right, when the acrylic coating on the body splits... we'll be turning an invader loose in the chamber... if we've caught one.
Let's find out. The pressure, Dr. Penner.
Nothing's happening.
Now we've got one of those things in here... and a mob of those dead men right outside.
If you hadn't gone out in the truck, they couldn't have followed us.
John, shut up.
Another point, Dr. Penner.
Look!
The thing is in there.
Yeah.
It looks like we caught ourselves an invader.
The rest is up to you, Dr. Penner.
Wait.
It's left the body.
Let's hope we can keep it locked up in that chamber.
Do not think you will succeed.
There is no way on your earth to make us visible.
Your people are being destroyed... country by country.
My unit has already received reports... that many of your nations are considering surrender.
You're lying.
You can check with your commanders for the truth.
If they had surrendered, you would have said so.
It is inevitable.
If you will surrender to me now... your lives will be spared.
Look, friend, you're the prisoner.
And as long as we have you to work over, we still have a chance.
Lamont, Dr. Penner, we'll continue on with the tests.
You will die, then, as all the rest of you shall die.
Dr. Penner and Dr. Lamont began immediate... experiments in a desperate effort... to make the invader visible to the human eye.
The vast scientific knowledge of the two men... was put to the test in a race against time.
For they knew that with every moment of failure... thousands more people all over Earth would die.
Time was running out for the defenders.
The world was nearing the end of its ability to fight back... for this was the third day.
By midnight, the human race on Earth would cease to exist.
They still trying to batter down the door?
No, they gave that up.
But they're still out there.
Probably trying to figure a new way to get at us.
That thing in the chamber knows we're trapped and that we can't get out alive.
If we surrendered, you think they'd let us live?
Maybe. We won't know if we don't try.
All our experiments have failed. Why wait?
We're not giving up.
Or do you two go along with him?
Major, we've tested everything.
Light rays, every shade on the spectrum... chemicals, mechanical devices, nothing.
We can't make it visible, we can't hurt it.
I asked you a question.
Do you agree with Lamont or don't you?
I don't know.
I'm too weary to think straight anymore.
Look. We can't hold out here forever.
Let's take their offer. See what happens.
Look, the three of you.
That thing in the chamber is bluffing.
The very fact that he's offering us our lives if we stop the tests... proves that we're on to something.
And he's afraid we're gonna find out.
You're a fool.
We're no closer now than we were an hour ago.
You do what you like. I'm taking the offer.
I'm letting that thing out of the chamber.
Make him stop.
John, I think we've hit on something.
- What, Dad?
- The creature.
You heard the alarm bell on the radiation counter.
The explosion and concussion made the creature react.
Nothing else has.
React?
We've been looking the wrong way for our answer.
It isn't in light waves or chemicals.
The answer is in sound!
- Sound, John!
- Sound to create sight?
You said the device used by that creature that came to your house... caused a humming sound.
Yes, the sound was low-key to our ears... but the device must've used sonic rays.
Sound vibrations that created resonance... with the basic molecular structure of the metal ore.
And that resonance caused visibility!
I just hope it isn't too late.
Sound is the answer.
He certainly reacted during the explosion.
Listen. When the chemicals in that flask hit the panel... it caused a short circuit... jumped the breakers and blew up our entire air-conditioning and filtering system.
Luckily, our radio's still intact.
- How long can the air last?
- An hour and a half.
Then we'll have to open the air vents.
We'll be sitting ducks for what's waiting for us outside.
Major, I want to apologize.
It's all right. Forget it.
Look, if you think sound is the answer, you better make sure, and fast.
There. That ought to do it.
Now, both these pieces of equipment are identical.
If one doesn't generate enough sound, we'll use both... and probably break our own eardrums.
- Nothing, nothing at all.
- Keep going.
Major, there's your weapon.
It not only makes the invaders visible, but destroys them as well.
Could the army turn these out in a hurry?
I could give headquarters all the details in a few minutes.
Good. Come on.
May Day Homer, this is Able Fox Niner Six, over.
Able Fox Niner Six...
There's a high-powered jamming signal in the area.
- You think the invaders are doing it?
- Deliberately, to kill our broadcasts.
The spaceship must be close by.
We could use the jamming signal to find the spaceship... by tracking it on the direction-finding radio in the truck.
Yeah. That'd be our only chance to get your information to Gen. Stone.
Yes. But what about the invaders waiting for us outside?
We're gonna crash right through.
If you have any prayers for a job like this... you better start saying them.
After you let us out, get to the transmitter.
When the jamming signal goes off, call the General in a hurry.
Good luck, Major.
Don't miss with the sound gun.
It's the only chance you have against radiation.
Okay, Dr. Penner, open her up.
The radio jamming set up by the invisible spaceship... was the only key to the location of the ship.
The directional-finding equipment on the truck operated by Dr. Lamont... had to use this key successfully... or all hope would be gone.
Slowly, but surely... the radio jamming led the truck to the immediate area... of the invisible ship used by the invaders.
Hold it.
May Day Homer. This is Able Fox Six.
Come in, please.
May Day Homer to Able Fox Niner Six.
Come in, Able Fox Niner Six.
Come in, please.
In the United Nations building in New York, a special meeting was called.
Present were Dr. Penner, his daughter...
Major Jay and Dr. Lamont... to receive grateful thanks from the countries of the world.
Earth had been on the brink of disaster.
But out of the holocaust of war... in which a dictatorship of the universe had been defeated... a lesson had been learned.
The nations of the world could work... and fight together, side by side... in a common cause.
- Sir?
Can you please tell me where
I can find Dolls Incorporated?
- Room 502, first door on your left.
- Thank you.
These are the Brownies from the Valley High School.
- The girls are here to visit the factory, Mr. Franz.
Yes, Mr. Franz.
He'll be with you in a moment.
I'm sure the girls would like to see the doll display while they're waiting.
- Well, fine.
Thank you.
- [Girl] I like the one over there next to you.
It's beautiful.
- [Girl] I like the one over there.
- [Girl] They've got so many beautiful dresses.
I like the one over there best.
There are so many, I don't know which one I want.
- Don't let Mr. Franz catch you.
He's very particular about these dolls.
Nobody's allowed to touch them.
Come on, let's look at the other dolls.
- Young lady, do you like my dolls?
- Oh, I think they're lovely.
- Do you really?
You must meet some of them.
My dolls are fashioned from all walks of life.
Here's a bride.
Isn't she lovely?
And over here, now let me see.
Here's a housewife going shopping.
And here, oh my, yes-
She's very important.
This is my nurse.
She helps to keep my little people well.
Wouldn't do for anything to happen to them, would it, nurse?
- You treat them like real people.
- But of course.
They're my friends.
My name is Franz.
What's yours, my dear?
- Sally Reynolds.
You came about my ad, I suppose.
- Yes. But I don't think
I'm the girl for the job.
- Wait, please.
Let me be the judge, huh?
How much experience have you had?
- Very little.
I worked a year in a college bookstore, that's all.
- Married?
- No.
- Live with your family?
- I haven't any family.
I'm on my own.
I'm sure there's somebody else that's better qualified.
- You're exactly the one
I want, Miss Reynolds.
I'd like you to start right away.
- I don't know what I'm supposed to do.
- Just answer the phone, take care of my accounts and my correspondence.
As you can see, I'm no good at paperwork.
- I'm sorry, Mr. Franz.
I couldn't.
- I have no one to help me with my dolls.
I work alone.
I need someone in the office.
Whatever you do, your work will be satisfactory, my dear.
I pay the usual wages, but if that isn't enough,
I could manage a little more.
Won't you please try it?
Just for a day or two?
- Dolls Incorporated.
One moment, please.
A Mr. Grant for you.
- I'll take it in the back room.
Yes, Mr. Grant.
- [Grant] I understand you had a secretary named Janet Hall?
- Yes, Miss Hall used to work for me.
- [Grant] Do you have any idea where I can reach her?
- Well, she left last week.
She was going to take a better position with Pathay.
You might try to reach her there.
- [Grant] This is Pathay.
She never showed up.
- If you see her, will you have her get in touch with me?
- I'd be glad to, Mr. Grant.
I'll make a note of it right away.
- [Grant] Thank you, goodbye.
- Goodbye.
Who is it?
- It's Sally.
Mr. Franz, if I'm to work for you,
I'll need the cash ledger.
Can you tell me where it is?
- I'm afraid I don't know.
Janet took such good care of things.
I'll be right out and help you look for it.
- Well, hello!
Who are you?
- My name is Sally.
I work for Mr. Franz.
- Since when?
- Six weeks ago.
Do you have business with Mr. Franz?
- I sure do.
I'm Bob Westley, the best salesman in St. Louis.
- Well, he can't be disturbed right now.
You may wait or perhaps come back later.
- [Bob] The least you can do is tell him I'm here.
- But I'm sorry, he just can't be disturbed.
- He's not in the factory.
Now, are you gonna tell me where he is?
- Please, don't get me into trouble.
Mr. Franz is in the back room.
And when he's in that room, he never wants to be disturbed.
- All right, all right, don't get excited.
But can't you send up some smoke signals or something?
Call him on the phone.
- He'd be furious.
- Mr. Franz, furious?
They don't come any milder than him.
Say, are you afraid of him?
- Please, I've got work to do.
If you'll excuse me,
I'll be able to do it.
- Look.
- Let's start all over again.
I apologize.
I don't want to get you into any trouble, and I want to be friends.
Okay?
- Okay.
- All right, now that we're friends, tell me the truth.
Are you afraid of your boss?
- No, I'm not afraid of him.
Maybe just a little.
He does get a little peculiar at times.
- What times?
- When he talks to them.
He's so serious.
It's almost as if he expected them to talk back.
- Who?
- Why, the dolls, of course.
- The dolls? (laughs)
- Wait, just a minute.
- Good morning, Sally.
Been dreaming up anything new about the boss?
- Dolls Incorporated?
- It's on the fifth floor.
- Second floor!
- Well, I can take the letter.
I work there.
- Are you Miss Hall?
- No.
- Well, it's registered.
Someone will have to sign for it.
- Maybe you better see Mr. Franz about it.
- Third floor!
- Are you another new man?
Seems we just got one lately.
- I'm special delivery.
- Fourth floor!
- Whatever happened to that friendly fellow who brought the mail around here for so long?
- You mean Old Ernie?
Funny thing, two days before he was to retire and get a pension, he disappeared.
Yes sir, started out one morning with his mail sack and never came back.
- Yes, Miss Reynolds.
I'll be right out and sign for it.
Bob.
Good morning.
- Morning.
- I'm sorry I don't know
Miss Hall's new address, but I expect her to stop by in a day or two.
I'll see she gets this.
- [Delivery Man] Thank you.
Come on in, Bob.
- Sorry if I hurt your feelings.
- I'll be right with you, Bob.
- [Sally] How beautiful!
- Yes, very nice.
The price doesn't seem too out of line.
I'll take four gross of that.
What do you like, my dear?
- This one here.
- The white organdy with the blue ribbons.
- Ah, It's a pity you can't model it for us.
I can see it would be very becoming on you.
Yes.
- Well, two gross of the strapless organdy, and two of the negligee.
- How about lingerie to go with it?
- Yes, you can put that in, too.
When can you deliver them?
- [Salesman] Ten days.
Is that all right?
- Yes.
- Will that be all, Mr. Franz?
- Do you mind if I keep this strapless organdy?
You can charge it to my order.
- I think that'll be all right.
Thank you, Mr. Franz.
Thank you, Miss.
- Here, let me get rid of some of this stuff for you.
- Miss Reynolds, I don't know what I'd ever do without you.
- Yes, Miss Reynolds.
Who?
No!
By all means, tell him
I'll be right there.
An old friend out of the past is here to see me.
Shall we call it a day?
I'd have to stop soon anyway to mix more plastic.
So, you'll forgive me, won't you?
- Certainly, sir.
- Hey!
- My dear friend, how are you?
- [Franz] Emil, what a surprise.
I didn't even know you were in this part of the world.
- I arrived yesterday.
- With your puppets?
- Why of course, of course.
My puppets open their show next Monday.
And listen, Franz, I should like you very much to come to the theater and meet them.
- Of course, I should be happy to.
- Good.
- How did you ever find me?
- Well, I thought I'd need the services of a marionette-maker while I was here.
So, I opened the directory and there was your name.
It's been a long time, Franz.
No more show business, huh?
- No, no, I gave that up.
I just have dolls now.
- Dolls, eh?
- Many, many dolls, as you can see.
- As long as you enjoy it.
- Tell me, how's your dear Emma?
- Emma, Emma.
- Emma, the girl with the beautiful golden hair, your wife.
- I have tried so long to forget that name,
I sometimes almost succeed.
She left me.
- When did this happen?
My marionettes were playing in Luxembourg.
And she ran away with someone she liked better.
An acrobat.
- Acro, oh, how that must've hurt.
How that must've hurt, Franz.
- But I'm happy now at any rate, and that's what counts.
Emil, let me take you to dinner.
- [Emil] Why not, why not?
- And we'll have time to stop at the theater and visit your marionettes.
- That's an excellent idea, Franz.
- So, let us go.
- And wait till you meet my little puppets.
- (applauding) Bravo, bravo, bravo!
Excellent, Franz, excellent.
You know, I haven't seen a performance like that in ages.
Well, well, well.
This is like the good old days again, huh, Franz?
You were once the best in our profession.
You still could be, if you wanted to.
Well, you see, things have been getting too much for me lately and I've been thinking of a partner.
What about joining me, huh?
- It doesn't interest me.
- Why not?
Because my marionettes are getting old and need attention?
- Oh, I don't mind repairing them, it isn't that.
- What is it, then?
- I'm content in my doll factory.
Isn't it time we ate?
- Do you know what's wrong with you, my friend?
- Why must someone who's content with things the way they are always have something wrong with him?
- Contentment is unnatural.
Emma's leaving must've done you a great deal of harm, my boy.
- You think so?
You've run away from life.
You've surrounded yourself with all shapes of people, with their faces, their legs, their arms.
Even little mannequins of them.
But not their spirit.
You're afraid of that.
- Well, I've found peace, anyhow.
- Will it last?
- I have no fear it won't.
I love my dolls and I'm quite sure they'll never leave me.
Let's forget about the past, Emil, and have a good time, huh?
Living in the present is the only important thing.
And then after dinner, we'll go back to my shop, huh?
- Excellent idea.
- How about that?
- Happy?
- Mmhm.
Did you pick this show for any particular reason?
- I get tired of the same things all the time.
Don't you?
- Yes, I do.
Such as what?
- Dolls.
- Why don't you ask me what it feels like to be a freak?
- Please sir, I--
- This is how it feels to be so big you can stick your fist through a circus top!
Like a clown!
- Mr. Franz said you were going back to St. Louis tomorrow.
- Maybe.
- [Colossal Man] It's ingestible,
I can grow to be 100 feet tall!
And I don't need a change of wardrobe.
- How would you like to come with me?
- What would I do in St. Louis?
- Live in a pretty little house.
Become Mrs. Bob Westley.
- Man lives through plutonium blast.
That's a great joke, isn't it, sergeant? (laughs)
- Why do you think I've been hanging around all these weeks?
What do you say?
- I don't know what to say.
- Don't say anything.
- Do you want to go back to your quarters and tell your friends about the monster, about the circus freak?
That's right, sergeant.
I'm a circus freak.
Have a tent, will travel.
Why don't you make a sign saying: see the amazing colossal man?
- Say, I got a terrific idea.
What do you say we fly to Las Vegas tomorrow and get married?
- I couldn't leave without telling Mr. Franz I'm going.
- Well, let me tell him.
I'll see him first thing in the morning.
You get packed and be ready and I'll pick you up at 10:00.
How's that?
- Wonderful.
- [Colossal Man] I'm not growing, you're shrinking!
- Hello?
- Miss Reynolds.
Is anything the matter?
When you didn't come to the office this morning,
I began to worry.
- Well, hasn't Mr.
Westley been to see you?
- Yes, he was here earlier, but he's left.
- [Sally] Where did he go?
- Back to St. Louis, I believe.
Miss Reynolds, Miss Reynolds?
Are you all right?
- Yes.
- Can I expect you at the office this morning?
- Yes. I'll be there.
- All right.
Ah, there you are.
Now things are as they should be.
By the way, I left the bill for those St. Louis shipments on your desk.
- I'll see to them right away.
Mr. Franz, did Bob go by air?
- No, by train.
I believe he had his ticket all ready.
- It was very sudden.
- Well, he'd been neglecting his business lately.
It probably caught up with him.
- Didn't he tell you anything about me?
- Yes, of course, he did.
He told me that he'd asked you to marry him, and that you had consented.
When's it to be?
- He didn't...
I mean, we haven't set the date.
- Bob gave me to understand that you wouldn't have worked for me after you were married.
I begged him not to take you away.
I told him how sad it is when people go.
Oh, my dear.
I didn't mean to make you unhappy.
Is it because he didn't come and say goodbye?
That wasn't very thoughtful of him.
Will you listen to an old friend?
Perhaps it would be better if you tried to forget him.
- I don't know what to think.
That's not true, I do know.
Bob wouldn't treat me this way if he could help it.
Something's happened to him.
- When did you make this, Mr. Franz?
While Bob was here.
- It could be him, almost.
- Well, thank you for the compliment.
The aim of every composer is to fit the world within the limits of his symphony.
A writer wants to put all of life between the covers of his book.
If I can make my dolls in the image of those I know and love,
I'm satisfied.
Oh, it's a small talent, I know, but I have to make the most of it.
It's the only one I have.
I'll be out of the office for an hour or so, Miss Reynolds.
Will you lock up, my dear?
I have my own key.
- Pardon me.
Can you tell me where
Sergeant Paterson is?
Thank you.
Sergeant Paterson?
- Yes.
- I'm Sally Reynolds.
The man at the desk sent me to you.
- Oh, yes.
Sit down, Miss Reynolds.
Here it is.
You say in this report you made downstairs that your fiancé disappeared mysteriously.
Just what does that mean?
- Something Mr. Franz did to him.
- Such as?
- Well, Mr. Franz did something to him.
- You said that.
- Well, I don't know how else to put it.
- Did he hit him?
Did he shoot him?
Did he strangle him?
- No, he...
You won't believe me.
- Well, that's my business.
Now tell me, just what did he do?
- He made Bob into a doll.
- He made your fiancé into a doll.
I see.
Well, we'll let you know if we learn anything, Miss Reynolds.
I knew you wouldn't believe me.
Suppose there were some other people that disappeared the same way?
Would you do something then?
- That all depends.
Who were they?
- Janet Hall.
- Anyone else?
- A mailman named Ernie.
- Ernie Larson.
Go on.
- Well, isn't that enough?
I guess it is.
- Okay, let's go and see this Mr. Franz.
- He's taken Bob down.
He must have him inside.
- Is this the man?
- Yes.
- The lady says you've been making people disappear mysteriously, turning them into dolls.
- Why, Miss Reynolds, what made you say such a thing?
That's perfectly ridiculous.
- Is that Westley?
How come it looks just like her boyfriend?
- I model all my dolls after people I know and like.
People I like to have near me.
There's nothing wrong with that, is there?
- May I see it, please?
- Certainly.
- It's lifelike, all right.
- Well, I should hope so.
But I assure you, it's only a doll.
Watch.
What did you expect, my dear?
They're only made of plastic.
You see, here's a whole case full of them.
- Well, looks like your boyfriend kind of took a powder, doesn't it?
Okay, I'll put through a tracer on him, anyway.
Be seeing you.
- Feel free to drop in anytime, Sergeant.
- Thank you.
- Oh, you weren't thinking of going too, were you, dear?
- Of course.
- Please, don't.
It would make me so unhappy.
- Do you really expect me to work for you after all this?
- I think of your pretty eyes and your lovely voice, and the beautiful flowers on your desk, and I ask myself, how could I ever bear to let you go?
- But it's impossible.
- Now why do you say that, my dear?
- Because I can't stand being in this place another minute.
It's locked!
Open the door, it's locked!
No, no!
- Be careful, my dear.
You aren't afraid of me, are you?
Why, I'm your friend.
You mustn't feel bad, Miss Reynolds.
It's time for you to put on your new clothes.
You don't want to meet your fiancé dressed in nothing but a napkin, do you?
Here they are.
First your toilet articles.
And your stockings.
And the dress.
Oh, it's very pretty.
You remember you selected this yourself?
You want to make yourself look nice, I'm sure.
You're going to meet Bob.
Shall I help you?
That's better.
He's only asleep, Miss Reynolds.
What you might call a state of suspended animation.
- Bob, Bob!
- Oh, be patient, he'll be with you in a minute.
This fresh air will revive him in no time.
You don't know how much I enjoy these little reunions.
You funny little people.
I wonder why it is you always hate me so at first.
I haven't really harmed you.
You get the best of care.
I never let you get too warm or cold, too hungry or too tired.
You should be grateful.
Think.
No daily grind, no budget problems, no taxes or debts or family to support.
I see to everything.
And it's never dull.
You sleep away the long boring hours in your jars, and when I take you out to wake you, it's only to have fun.
To enjoy some new treat
I've thought up for you.
Don't you see how fortunate you are?
You have nothing to do all the rest of your little lives but be happy.
- That's what you think!
Change us back the way we were!
- I like you better the way you are.
- Are you going to keep us this size?
- Always.
- What have you done to us?
- Would you really like to know?
It's my secret, but I don't think you'll give me away.
It's a very simple principle, really.
Notice how this slide projector throws a visual image.
I can make it any size I choose.
When I push it closer to the wall, the picture becomes smaller.
Being of an inquiring mind,
I asked myself one day if I couldn't do the same with living things.
I reasoned that if I could pass them through a device similar in principle to this slide projector then I would be able to project these living things to any size that I would choose.
This is the answer I found.
Here, Tommy.
Tommy, Tommy, Tommy!
To project a complex molecular structure, such as a man or say a cat, it's only necessary to change them into energy first.
Much as the light in that slide projector.
I soon found out that the most practical way of causing this change was to break down the molecular structure by means of high-frequency vibration.
Now, with this tuning fork, I will set up a sonic vibration.
Just as the glass disintegrated through the resonant frequency sent out by this tuning fork, so will a living thing disintegrate to its resonant frequency.
Of course, it's a much higher frequency.
Oh, there you are, Tommy.
Now, watch this.
All right, kitty, I have something for you.
Now, watch the cat.
You remember Tommy, Miss Reynolds.
He always liked you.
Take him.
Being so small, he may feel strange at first.
Pet him.
I must get some of the other little people who live with me.
I want them to meet you.
- Hello, big boy.
Who's your friend?
- [Franz] Miss Reynolds, may I introduce Miss Lane?
- Call me Georgia.
They all do.
Glad to meet you, Sally.
Welcome to the toy department.
- [Laurie] Hi, kids!
- This is Laurie.
She's a swell kid.
Laurie, meet Bob and Sally.
- How are you?
- Hello.
- Gosh, I'm awfully sleepy.
How long did he put me away this time?
- For a couple of months, anyhow.
Say, you missed a lot of fun, we had a picnic in a flower box, two dances, and a moonlight swimming party in the sink.
And all because I wouldn't sing for him.
- Hi, Laurie, long time no see.
Hi, everybody.
- Well hi Stan.
Say hello to Bob and Sally.
And if it isn't Mac, pride of the Marine Corps.
Mac, meet Bob and Sally.
- Well, welcome, stranger.
Hey, the old Franz is learning how to pick 'em better all the time.
- Hey, when are we gonna get this party rolling?
- Yeah, let's go!
What are we waiting for, big boy?
We got a new arrival here to celebrate!
- I have some refreshments for our little party.
A petit four.
A knife to cut it with.
Some tiny little cups and saucers.
And a miniature bottle of champagne.
Please help yourselves.
I'm afraid I'm a little too clumsy to serve my guests when they're as small as you.
- [Georgia] Oh, boy.
This is great!
- A toast to the new members of the family, Sally and Bob.
- Are you two engaged?
Say, when's the wedding going to be?
- You'd better ask him.
- Poor Bob and Sally.
There's no one your size who can marry you.
I'll have to see what I can do about it, sometime.
- Stop! All of you stop!
How can you be so calm?
Call for help, run, do something, anything but this!
- Say, what's the matter with her, anyway?
I got used to this size in about 10 minutes.
And believe me, brother,
I kind of like it.
I ain't never had it so easy in my life.
- Look at it this way, Sally.
We're in a jam, and there's nothing to do but make the best of it, for the time being anyway.
- I know how she feels.
I took it pretty hard, too.
But we sometimes have to do things we don't want to just to have some freedom like this.
- Listen, he drops a capsule in your jars to put you to sleep.
Don't breathe any of it--
- Pipe down, everybody, he's coming back.
- Come on, baby, let's go.
- [Mac] Rock it, rock it!
- Now, Laurie, you must sing for us.
- No, I don't want to sing.
- [Franz] But you will, my dear, or back in the bottle you go.
♫ You're a dolly
♫ You're so cute and lovely, dearest little doll
♫ Say you want me to be near you
♫ To be yours forever more, my little doll
♫ You're so precious, you're so darling
♫ You're all that I could want, a living doll
♫ Never leave me, don't deceive me
♫ Stay with me forever more, my living doll
♫ Never leave me
♫ Don't deceive me
♫ Stay with me forever more, my living doll
- Yes?
- I was passing by and saw the light in your window.
I thought you might be lonesome, so I dropped in.
You mind?
- That was kind of you, Emil.
Tell me, how did your opening night go?
- Franz, wonderful, wonderful.
Come and sit down and I'll tell you all about it.
- Let me put things away, huh?
- Ah, but it will only take one minute.
- You must hear what happened last night.
Come, sit down, will you?
First of all, everybody was there.
But everybody!
- He's got somebody outside.
- The telephone.
The police.
Does anybody know their number?
- I should remember.
I called them just yesterday.
- Come on, come on, hurry up!
- Police department.
Police department!
- We're at Dolls Incorporated!
Fifth floor of the Tilford building!
Please hurry!
- Police department!
Anybody on this line?
- Oh, he can't hear me.
It's the music.
- But if we stop it, Franz is sure to come back.
- Tilford building!
Fifth floor!
Dolls Incorporated!
- [Switchboard Operator]
Anybody on this line?
- [All] Help! Help!
Help! Help!
- Oh, what's the use?
Nobody can hear little people like us.
- It's awful when you think there are people all around us, and we can't even get through to them.
- And then, right after the first act, who do you suppose--
- Emil, I simply have to go now.
- Now wait a minute, Franz, wait.
You don't know who came backstage to congratulate me.
- Just a minute.
I have to take care of the record player.
- There, you see.
The record player takes care of itself.
Now come on, let me finish it.
- Franz, listen.
I tell you, it was like the good old days in Brussels.
Now, will you guess the name of the party who came backstage?
Come on, try, try.
- I can't guess.
You tell me.
- The machine.
I was wondering if we could go through it the other way and come out our right size again.
He said it works like a projector.
I'll bet I could figure out the controls.
- It may not be a good idea to fool with it.
You might get killed.
- I don't care.
I'm willing to risk it.
- I am, too.
Who wouldn't be?
- Well, one's enough.
It only takes one of us to go for help.
Shall we try it?
- [All] Yeah.
- No no no, hold it, you living dolls, but I was one of his first puppets.
So I deserve the right to be the guinea pig, okay?
- All right, Mac.
If that's the way you want it.
You know what can happen if I make a mistake.
- Come on, let's go.
- Well if it does work, you're going to need some clothes, now I'm pretty sure he keeps our old ones in that closet.
- That's right.
I saw him hang mine up over there.
- Well, come on, let's go.
You three girls better stay up here.
I'll work the controls.
Stan, you go to the door and keep an eye out for Franz.
- Just a minute.
- There you go.
Okay, Mac.
Come on, let's go!
- How splendid for you.
- So, I said to myself, I said, at last I'm being appreciated.
I could have wept for happiness, Franz.
- And I am happy for you.
May I go now?
- Well, I shouldn't detain you like this, should I?
You go on and--
- You see, I have to be alone in this kind of work, I'm doing.
You understand?
- [Stan] Hold it!
- Why don't you go and do what you have to do, and I'll talk to you while you work?
- No, no.
I'd rather give you my undivided attention, old friend.
So tell me, what happened then?
- Okay.
- We'd better get back.
- What about a nightcap with me, huh?
- Oh, I only wish I could.
- Oh, lunch tomorrow then, huh?
- Certainly.
I'll call for you about noon.
- Excellent, excellent.
- Well, I suppose there's nothing more for us to say but goodnight, huh?
- Let's be bold and get it over with.
Goodnight.
- [Emil] Goodnight.
- [Mac] Come on, Stan.
- You've had enough fun for tonight.
Come to bed quickly now.
It's time.
Come in.
- Ah, Sergeant, how are you?
- Fine, Mr. Franz.
- You don't mind if I go on with my work, do you?
I'm shorthanded and
I've fallen way behind.
- I notice you're advertising for another secretary.
- Yes, it's quite a problem keeping help these days.
- How'd you happen to lose Sally Reynolds?
- She went to St. Louis, I believe.
Her fiancé lives there, you know.
- Well, I could have saved her the trip.
- Why have you news of him?
- Well, he didn't show up at home, and we've been asked to do more some more checking on him here.
- How strange.
What do you suppose could have become of him?
- Well, that's what I came to ask you.
- Mister, can you fix my dolly?
- Will you excuse me?
- Go ahead, take care of your customer.
I'll just look around.
- Well, let's see what we can do for you.
Tell me, what's your dolly's name?
- Susie.
She got run over.
- Oh, dear, dear, dear.
How did that happen?
- She ran out in the street while I wasn't looking.
- (clicks tongue) That wasn't nice of her, was it?
- She's a bad dolly.
- You know, you ought to spank her when she disobeys.
- I do, but it doesn't seem to do any good.
Are your dollies like that?
- They do get rather headstrong sometimes.
- Mr. Franz?
What's in here?
- [Franz] Oh, just a workroom.
- Well, may see it, please?
- There's nothing there that would interest you, Sergeant.
I go there whenever I'm lonely.
- I would like to see it.
May I have the key, please?
Thank you.
- You have so many dollies.
They must give you a lot of trouble.
- Yes, but they're nice.
I never get lonely and that makes up for it.
- Oh look!
Isn't that cute?
Can I have it?
No, dear, no, no.
- Please, why not?
- Well, everybody would want to know where you got it.
You know, grownups ask so many awkward questions.
Now you better give it to me.
- Don't take it away from me, I want it.
- What do you call this thing in here?
- You can play with it until I get back.
- Oh, that?
Well, what's it look like to you?
- You've got me.
- You know what a photographic enlarger is, don't you?
- Well, this works just the opposite.
I use it to make models of people.
Wouldn't you like to see how it works?
- Some other time.
I've got to be running along.
We'll, what you got there, little girl?
Let's see.
A tape recording inside.
You like it?
- [Girl] Uh-huh.
Can I have it?
- No. But you can come and play with it anytime you like.
- And the cat?
- Yes. That, too.
- About those missing people,
I'll be checking with you later.
- I do hope you find them soon, Sergeant.
- Thank you.
Bye, honey.
- [Girl] Bye,
- Now, to fix your dolly.
(chuckles) This is one of the best puppets you ever had, Emil.
- It's one of the best Jekyll and Hydes there ever was.
It was made by Schwartz, back in the good old days in Prague.
But a funny thing, every time the cue comes for Jekyll to change into Hyde, nothing happens.
- Did you bring me back here at this late hour because your star puppet was a little temperamental?
- Please, Franz.
Please understand my predicament.
- There are only three people in the world
I trust to cure him.
Mariani, who's in Milan.
Auriac, but he's in Paris, and you.
- You know perfectly well I never could resist flattery.
- How much time can I have to work on him?
- Well, you see, we have a matinee tomorrow at 2:00.
It would be tragic to return all that money for the tickets.
Can you have him ready that soon?
- I'll try it, even if it takes me all night.
- Good, and, one more thing, how much is this gonna cost?
- Oh nothing.
That's the least I can do for an old friend.
- Thank you, thank you.
- May a dear old friend ask you something of a personal nature?
- Certainly.
- What are you up to that brings the police over to ask me all sorts of questions?
- When was this?
- This afternoon.
A police sergeant named Paterson.
He comes to my hotel room, and it sounds fantastic,
He asked me if you were in the habit of making people disappear.
- I suppose you told him
I do it all the time?
- Ah but seriously, it's bad business to have police prying into your affairs.
- Emil, I'm quite serious.
If I thought I was being watched
I would find life intolerable.
Now, be a good fellow, will you, and tell the night doorman to let me in the theater later on.
I'll have to give Mr. Hyde a tryout when he's finished.
- I'll run along now.
I'll do it on my way home.
I don't suppose I have to tell you how grateful I am to you, Franz.
- Oh, nonsense!
Good night, Emil.
And goodbye.
Oh.
Sorry you're awake, Miss Reynolds.
Makes everything much more difficult.
- What are you going to do?
- The police have been asking my friend, Emil, questions.
They're getting uncomfortably close.
That leaves me only one course.
- You'll free us, won't you?
You'll make us our right size again?
- And be deprived of your company?
Oh no, I couldn't let that happen.
Can't you see?
It's better that we all bow out together.
Oh please, don't be frightened.
Can't you see?
It's much better that we all meet death together than for any one of us to be left alone.
There's nothing worse than loneliness.
Wait, wait, I have a splendid idea.
Yes, we'll have a going-away party for all of us.
A celebration.
My friend Emil asked me to fix his puppet and leave it at the theater.
We'll have our party there, a theater party.
Now, let's all get ready.
- Say, what's the matter with being a bottle baby?
Look at the service we get.
Oh, the old boy is really letting go.
He's been giving us parties like they're going out of style.
And tonight, a theater party no less.
- You better enjoy it,
Georgia, as it may be our last.
- What are you talking about?
- Sally!
Tell her.
- He said that tonight.
He said tonight he was to kill us all, himself too.
- You'd better hurry up and dress.
We'll tell the boys.
- Bob, Bob, he said he's going to--
- Yeah, I know.
We heard you tell Georgia.
- Oh, if I was just my old size for five minutes.
- Hey, let's try the telephone again.
There's no music now.
Maybe they'll hear us.
- Yeah sure.
So would Franz.
He's just outside the door.
Hey, the window.
It's slightly open.
Maybe we could signal somebody.
- Sure we can.
We're only five stories up.
- Hey, here's some paper.
Somebody get something to write with.
Laurie, keep an eye out for Franz.
- Here's an old paintbrush.
It's all dried up.
- Say, how about using some of this lipstick?
- [Stan] Hey, here's a pencil.
- [Bob] Hey, that's great.
Bring it on over.
Let's see now.
I'll write, help, send police!
- Come on, hurry up.
Aim it good.
- Now, shall we take a taxi to the theater?
I think that'd be a nice treat.
Of course, you won't be able to see out the window, but I don't think you'll mind that little inconvenience.
At least, you'll be able to hear what the city sounds like at night because this time, I shan't put you to sleep.
You've been very good.
This is your reward.
- You all right, Mr. Franz?
- Yes, yes, fine.
- [Doorman] Kind of lonesome in a theater with nobody around.
- Not to me.
I have my puppets to keep me company.
- But you've been at it all night.
I thought maybe I'd get you some more coffee.
- No, no more coffee.
I still have plenty.
Don't come on the stage!
- All right, all right.
No more coffee.
- I've got one of those capsules he uses to put us to sleep.
We could slip it in his coffee.
It may not put him to sleep, but it'd probably slow him down some.
- Where'd you get it?
- The last time he put us away.
- Now then, I think our puppet friend Dr. Jekyll is ready for a trial.
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen,
I am Dr. Jekyll.
I have discovered a strange drug that is able to free my evil nature from what is good in me.
Then I become the sinister monster, Mr. Hyde.
With the assistance of a few members of our audience,
I'd like to put on one of the scenes from our little play.
Which one of you will volunteer?
Come now, we mustn't keep Dr. Jekyll waiting.
Miss Reynolds, you will play the good doctor's fiancé.
Georgia, you will be his victim.
And, now let me see, for
Dr. Jekyll's best friend...
Yes Bob, you should be very good in the part.
The rest of you just sit back and enjoy yourselves.
All right, you're on now, Miss Reynolds.
I'll prompt you on what to do.
- Go ahead, darling.
Keep his eyes off the coffee cup.
- Tell him he's been strange lately and ask him what's the matter.
- You've been strange lately.
Tell me what's the matter.
- Nothing, my dear.
Nothing at all.
It's only your imagination.
You must play up to him, Miss Reynolds.
Remember, you love him.
Say so.
Tell him he can trust you.
- You know I love you.
Why can't you be kind to me?
- No. More convincing, dear.
Try it again.
- You know I love you.
Why can't you be kind to me?
- That's it, my dear, that's it.
Things are different now.
They can never be changed back again.
Perhaps it would be best if we stopped seeing one another.
There is danger here for you and I wouldn't want anything to happen to you.
Ask him to confide in you.
- Why won't you tell me what's wrong?
- [Franz] I have traveled the road of no return.
There is no going back.
Only death can free me from the curse
I have put upon myself.
- Why you're more of a fiend than I thought!
If you're gonna kill us, get it over with!
Cut out this cat-and-mouse game!
- Bob, don't ruin our last act.
- Look at this puppet down here, Franz.
Look at it closely!
It's a monster all right, but not half the monster you are!
- Oh, stop it, Bob!
The puppet!
You're destroying the puppet!
Stop it, I tell you!
Stop it!
Who's there?
Me again.
Don't come on the stage!
I thought I told you I don't want to be disturbed.
- Well, I heard you shouting and I thought--
- You thought what?
- Maybe you want some more coffee.
- No, no, your coffee's fine and still have plenty.
- Bob!
Miss Reynolds!
Where have you run to?
Where are you hiding?
Where are you?
Don't run away from me!
Come, it's time for us to go!
- Who are you talking to, anyway?
- Haven't you heard a ventriloquist practice throwing his voice?
- Help! We're here!
- Come over here, help!
- [Doorman] Oh, I've heard about enough.
- There must be somebody nearby!
- It's 5:30 in the morning.
Most people are in bed now.
- Oh, it's hopeless!
- Let's try to get back to
Franz's place and the machine.
If we make it, we can come back for the others.
- It's this way.
- Second and main.
And we have to go to Seventh and Hill.
- How far is it?
About a mile, I think.
- When we're our size, that's the equivalent of six miles.
- How can we ever make it, Bob?
- We're not gonna make it standing here.
Come on.
- Who are you looking for?
- [Franz] Did you see them leave?
- Them? Who?
- Never mind.
- Are you sure it's this way?
- I think so.
I was almost sure that it was.
- Wait, Bob, look, it's the factory.
Come on, let's hurry.
- No wait, we have to go to the fifth floor.
The elevator operator won't be on for at least an hour.
We can't operate it ourselves.
Hey, what about freight?
- What do you mean?
- Well, there must be a freight elevator around back.
When do they make deliveries?
- I don't know.
Shipments usually come in before I get to work.
- Come on.
Hey, Wait!
Oh, it's all right.
He'll be back for another load in a minute.
- Bob, look!
Bob, look, the label!
It's for Mr. Franz.
- Go on, get out!
Get out of here!
- Hey, we're in luck.
He left the doors open.
- Mr. Franz!
Mr. Franz!
- What's the matter, honey?
Isn't Mr. Franz in?
Let me try.
- Well, it looks like we both missed him, doesn't it?
You like him, don't you?
Because he makes dollies?
- [Girl] And people, too.
- People?
- Little people.
- He makes little people, does he?
How?
- Out of big ones with a machine.
- Real little people?
People that walk and talk and everything?
How do you know?
- Mr. Franz showed me.
He said, sometimes when I'm good
I can play with them.
- [Paterso] So he isn't here to let you play with them, and that's why you're unhappy, huh?
- [Girl] He said I could play with his kitty.
- [Paterson] Oh, a kitty?
- [Girl] A little, tiny kitty.
Mr. Franz keeps it in a matchbox.
He made it in his machine.
- I see.
Isn't it time you were going to school?
Well, come on.
I'm going to take you there.
Little people.
Cat in a matchbox, huh?
Come on.
- Get away from that door.
Come on, Sally.
We'll call the police.
- Don't leave me.
Please don't leave me.
Don't leave me!
I'll be alone.

{3338}{3486}KYUSHU - MOUNT ASO
{4191}{4214}Hey!
{4260}{4291}Good Morning.
{4301}{4434}Hey, were you out last night again?|-Yes, I'm sorry.
{4442}{4465}That's not good!
{5220}{5341}Get back! Back off! What is this?|Stop getting so excited!
{5641}{5681}Stop! Stop!
{5689}{5759}How many times have I told you|to stop this foolishness?
{5767}{5851}I won't put up with this|anymore! Alright, Yoshi?
{5904}{5939}You too, Goro.
{6092}{6206}Well everyone, let's go, let's go!|Save your strength for the mines!
{6391}{6437}Good morning.|-Good morning.
{6775}{6803}Descending!
{7840}{7866}Hello!
{7875}{7915}Good morning.
{7981}{8062}It's very warm out today.
{8071}{8133}Haven't you figured out|what's wrong with the Earth?
{8140}{8191}What's happening to the Earth?
{8219}{8365}With eight million tons being mined out of this|entire area, I'd say the Earth is running out of ore.
{8374}{8402}Oh, no!
{8585}{8629}Hello, main office.
{8694}{8736}Filled with water?!
{8771}{8823}Mine number eight?
{8887}{8939}Alright, I'll be there soon.
{8982}{9065}Two meters of water has|flooded the mine.
{9086}{9215}That's strange. There wasn't any|there the last time it was surveyed.
{9245}{9298}It must be an underground spring.
{9305}{9336}I'll go check it out.
{9390}{9448}Hey, give me a hand here!|-Yes, sir!
{9791}{9840}It's shut down! It's shut down!
{9959}{9994}Go ahead!|-Go ahead!
{10314}{10344}Thank you for coming!
{10470}{10499}How did it happen?
{10507}{10585}We were mining a wall,|when it started flooding.
{10593}{10616}How bad is it?
{10624}{10731}It's flooded pretty bad...|We had no way to control it.
{10741}{10776}Well I'm glad that everyone's safe.
{10802}{10865}No... Yoshi and Goro are still down there.
{10890}{11018}I need to down and look at it.|I need some volunteers.
{11025}{11065}Is it okay?|-It's okay.
{11109}{11179}Suikishi, Saba... Let's go!
{11244}{11300}Be careful.|-Be careful.
{12751}{12797}That's Yoshi!
{12810}{12849}Hurry! Hurry!
{13020}{13081}Yoshi!|-Yoshi!
{13088}{13130}Hurry! Hurry!
{14272}{14305}Doctor...
{14357}{14432}It's hard to say.|It's not a simple wound.
{14465}{14539}I've never seen a|head wound like that.
{14549}{14666}But... What could have|done something like that?
{14747}{14806}You've contacted the police, right?
{14813}{14905}Yes. They should be here around 1 PM.
{15083}{15230}Yoshi's my husband! Let me see him! Please|let me see him! Please let me see him!
{15234}{15277}Please let me see him!|Please let me see him!
{15279}{15381}Wait! Wait! You'll have to|wait for the doctors see him.
{15741}{15770}Let's go.
{15873}{15921}Haven't they found Goro yet?
{15931}{16038}Hey! There's no proof|he's the criminal, right?
{16046}{16136}I'm prepared to believe it.|That's my opinion of it.
{16146}{16225}That's for the police to decide.|It's best to keep it to yourself.
{16234}{16370}But, he and Goro were working together.|Why haven't they found Goro's body?
{16381}{16461}Please don't go spreading this around.
{16998}{17045}Oh, they're taking a look at him now.
{17125}{17156}Kio...
{17365}{17417}Is it true about my brother?...
{17506}{17564}It's impossible.
{17572}{17613}But, everyone...
{17686}{17735}Believe in your brother.
{17759}{17921}Until they can get a hold of Goro,|they can't be sure if he's the criminal.
{17934}{17973}I'm sure of it.
{18262}{18400}I can walk with you to the mines.
{18409}{18453}Come on, let's go.
{18857}{18895}Oto!|-Here!
{18902}{18936}Oetsuka!|-Here!
{18945}{18980}Ooyama!|-Here!
{18986}{19019}Mamura!|-Here!
{19027}{19052}Hodo!|-Here!
{19066}{19092}Akeshita!|-Here!
{19100}{19132}Mamona!|-Here!
{19146}{19183}Akira!|-Here!
{19190}{19242}Here!|-Here!
{19752}{19855}We've completed a full roll call|and Goro is the only one missing.
{19931}{20019}You're sure that Goro|hasn't come out yet?
{20027}{20091}This is the only|way out of the mine.
{20163}{20192}You hear that?
{20235}{20270}You're too jumpy!
{20303}{20343}Someone must have gone in again.
{20352}{20470}No! The only person|in there would be... Goro.
{20554}{20625}Alright. I'm going in.
{20728}{20767}Give me the rope.
{20808}{20871}There must be something wrong with him.
{21754}{21802}What's that noise?
{21832}{21917}Goro? Goro!
{22161}{22190}It's him!
{22233}{22267}Idiot! Control yourself!
{22307}{22349}It may be nothing...
{22559}{22638}Goro?|-Goro!
{22891}{22920}It's him!
{22928}{23070}Idiot! There's nothing to|be afraid of! Keep quiet!
{25123}{25235}Hey, just a moment. Here they come!|-Hold on please.
{25838}{25889}These aren't ordinary murders.
{25904}{26033}How could a criminal make wounds|like this on these men?
{26153}{26316}The wounds could only have been|made by someone of great strength.
{26323}{26425}In Japan and in the rest of the world,|I've never seen a weapon so sharp.
{26432}{26471}What is the weapon?
{26546}{26601}I regret that I can't even guess.
{26608}{26681}Incredible... Murders unlike any in Japan.
{26688}{26753}Of course, we'll have to do something.
{26760}{26826}I'll increase the number|of police in the village.
{26946}{27014}Let me go! Let me go! Let me go!
{27021}{27063}Hurry! Get the others!
{27133}{27189}Otama! Otama!
{27203}{27262}Otama! Otama!
{27349}{27423}Kio! Kio!
{27497}{27564}Let me go! Let me go!
{27581}{27613}Stop!
{27617}{27786}She's right. You cannot|blame her for your pain, ok?!
{27837}{27871}Thank you...
{28711}{28748}Shigeru!
{29506}{29654}Kio... I don't believe|Goro is the murderer.
{29741}{29912}To kill... Goro would have|to be pushed too far.
{29964}{30074}I don't think he killed|anyone. I'm sure of it.
{30159}{30248}I believe Goro knows who did it.
{30360}{30485}So, don't count him out yet. Okay?
{30732}{30762}Kio!
{31092}{31176}Hey! Police! It's an emergency!
{31184}{31228}Oh! Let's go!
{31889}{31918}There!
{32294}{32406}Hurry! Hurry! Hurry, please!|Run across the bridge!
{32417}{32461}What's going on?
{32986}{33015}Come on!
{34209}{34238}There it is!
{34423}{34485}Alright, let's go!
{36062}{36090}Fire!
{36942}{37000}It's in sight!|-We're firing!
{37361}{37393}Look out!
{37947}{38013}Damn... Oh, no...
{38025}{38065}Alright, let's go!
{38813}{38875}Captain, I believe that|thing is our murderer.
{38915}{38948}That thing?!
{39359}{39531}Put me through. Ah, headquarters? This|is Nishima. What's the matter with you?!
{39538}{39631}When you assigned me here I thought I was|going after a criminal! What are you saying?!
{39638}{39745}I need men with pistols and machine guns|right away! Hurry, please! Don't delay!
{39834}{39904}The monster has retreated|into one of the older shafts!
{39906}{39932}Right!
{39977}{40048}Okane! Okane!|-Hurry! Hurry!
{40057}{40114}Hang in there!|-Help is coming!
{40154}{40226}Hey, is he okay?|Stretcher!
{40233}{40264}Okane!
{40306}{40346}Head inside!
{40383}{40436}Right. To the hospital!
{40561}{40684}Boss... If that thing's in|there, let me go after it.
{40688}{40762}Idiot! Going in|there is dangerous!
{40769}{40822}Besides, the military|is on its way here.
{41185}{41223}Let's go!
{42300}{42336}Halt!
{42469}{42504}Thank you for coming.
{42534}{42572}Remove the barrier.|-Yes, sir.
{43411}{43517}First unit, set up!|The rest keep moving!
{43733}{43771}It's filled with water!
{43799}{43843}Alright, let's go.
{44917}{44982}Goro! Goro!
{45257}{45286}Fire!
{46193}{46277}Right. I have an idea!|-Okay! Let's go!
{46357}{46415}Look out! It will|come this way!
{46549}{46591}Here I go!
{48168}{48219}Let's get the debris up front.|-Roger!
{48739}{48787}Hey! Just a moment!
{48890}{48961}Shoot! Fire, please!
{50032}{50168}Are you okay?|Are you okay?
{50364}{50451}I can't believe what we saw.
{50458}{50558}A creature like this is quite amazing.
{50565}{50651}For the Meganuron to have the|strength to do that to a man...
{50653}{50727}You could earn a living finding|proof of their existence.
{50734}{50808}You would expect it|to come from outer space.
{50815}{50919}Oh, I'm with the Seibu Newspaper.
{50974}{51096}It was inside the coal mine, so we can assume|the Meganuron hatched from an egg there.
{51130}{51256}Things that could affect its age range from|temperature and to where it was buried.
{51265}{51324}It may have been around for 3 or 4 years.
{51333}{51468}Although it's difficult to see how old it is,|I have enough data to produce a theory.
{51475}{51517}We understand.
{51525}{51704}This time, the larva changed tactics for a short|period and that created the outbreak of murders.
{51725}{51763}But why did it do that?...
{51822}{51866}How's the excavation going?
{51875}{51998}It was a large cave-in. I regret|that we haven't found him yet.
{52248}{52281}An earthquake!
{53010}{53047}Hello?
{53060}{53191}Yes, this is Chief Scientist Sugahara.
{53200}{53303}Hello. The earthquake we just felt...|Where was its epicenter?
{53313}{53452}We're just finishing... We believe|that it's near the area of Kotowataji.
{53469}{53529}Is the science center certain of that?
{53538}{53790}It's not exact. We think it was near coal mines,|but it wasn't strong enough to damage them.
{53799}{53868}I understand. Keep up the good work.
{53922}{53969}Get the cars.|-Yes, sir.
{54181}{54257}Hey, stop! Stop!
{54686}{54878}That's strange... I don't see how this much damage|could have been made from a shock like that.
{55025}{55075}Look at that guy over there!
{55716}{55790}Hey! Hey! What happened?
{55842}{55873}Is this Shigeru?
{55882}{55943}The last I heard he|was stuck in a cave-in.
{56012}{56122}Kamura! Kamura!|Hang in there! Kamura!
{56126}{56175}What happened to him?
{56182}{56286}Kamura! Kamura! Can you say|something for the Seibu Newspaper?
{56295}{56344}Kamura! Kamura!
{57040}{57097}Thank you...|-Let's get him inside.
{57764}{57797}Kamura!
{57859}{57920}Kamura!
{57986}{58034}Clear the way! Clear the way!
{58484}{58702}Kamura! It's me! Don't you know that|it's me? Take a look at me! It's me!
{58717}{58762}You know what my name is!
{59184}{59230}Shigeru!
{59403}{59440}Shigeru!
{59871}{59913}Shigeru!
{60201}{60315}What's... What's wrong with him?
{60332}{60660}As far as I can tell, he doesn't recognize any of you.|I'm not sure how long this amnesia will last.
{60669}{60826}We'll treat him at the hospital.|We'll take him right away.
{60852}{60888}Let's go...
{61284}{61411}Alright, take it easy.|Close your eyes.
{61471}{61533}Okay, open your eyes.
{61665}{61827}Once more, close your eyes|and take a deep breath.
{62043}{62083}And this is?
{62646}{62743}You were the first one to|see this. Look at it very carefully.
{62858}{62897}Can you remember it?
{63722}{63752}Shigeru!
{64321}{64495}Yes? Yes, they're going to pass over the volcano|tomorrow morning. Yes, this is Nishima.
{64554}{64615}It could erupt tomorrow?
{64690}{64798}It might be wise for them to|stay at their post? I understand.
{64806}{64944}I'll tell them it's urgent. Right, I understand.|I'll do what I can in the morning.
{64953}{65123}I can't believe they're doing it,|just so they can find this monster.
{65130}{65186}I would just blowit off the mainland!
{65517}{65766}This is Kitahara. Unknown object at 50.5 degrees,|20,000 feet, travelling at supersonic speed!
{65775}{65873}What? Did I hear him correctly?
{65881}{66140}Kitahara, Kitahara. This is base. Recommend you|check it out. Recommend that you check it out.
{66148}{66188}Roger, roger.
{66691}{66803}Base, base. This is Kitahara.|This is Kitahara.
{66812}{67002}Object in the sky still travelling at supersonic|speed. It just completed a 1 1/2 times vertical loop.
{67009}{67047}What?! One and a half?
{67058}{67140}The object is still travelling at a high speed.
{67148}{67264}Kitahara! Kitahara! Pursue it!|Escape if it comes after you!
{67271}{67310}Roger, roger!
{67839}{67882}It's coming back towards me!
{68037}{68111}It's moving too fast to avoid it! Damn!
{68182}{68252}Kitahara! Kitahara!
{68383}{68442}It's impossible!
{68461}{68545}But the radar showed|what happened in the air.
{68553}{68694}Is that what you think? How can something|that size manueuver so quickly in the air?
{68703}{68823}Of course, I don't know... but perhaps if|it had registered at other installations...
{69139}{69213}What do you think it was?
{69228}{69345}It didn't look anything|like a flying saucer.
{69506}{69622}Yes? Huh? Yes... Just a moment.
{69629}{69669}Excuse me. It's your office.
{69675}{69712}Oh, thank you.
{69731}{69781}Hello. This is lizeki.
{69835}{69895}It's been sighted at other locations?
{69946}{70044}What? They're talking|about flying saucers?
{70079}{70135}I'll be there.
{70143}{70256}I just got word from my office.|They're keeping track of the object.
{70286}{70339}Can't they tell us where it's going?
{70547}{70643}PEKlNG
{71211}{71274}PHlLLlPlNES
{72157}{72200}TOKYO
{72205}{72258}Is the Earth a target?
{72271}{72436}Many people believe that this flying|object is actually a flying saucer.
{72444}{72659}Also, this flying object has reached speeds|that would be impossible for us to achieve.
{72668}{72860}It was sighted in Peking at 11 :00 AM, then|sighted in Manila at 11 :20 AM, both Japan time.
{72979}{73078}Drive carefully on that mountain.|You never know what could happen.
{73085}{73163}We've already had our earthquake.|What else could possibly happen?
{75244}{75378}I can't see how they could both be dead.|There was no one else in the area.
{75387}{75541}If this was going to be a double suicide, wouldn't|their camera and shoe be close by them?
{75549}{75647}Really?|-Also, they wouldn't be apart.
{75660}{75769}This mess doesn't add|up to anything, huh?
{75828}{75956}These men would like to speak with you|later, regarding three missing cows.
{75966}{76014}We want to tell you about it.
{76125}{76181}The film is developed.|-Oh, it's done!
{76239}{76310}Hey, take care of those two.|-Yes, sir.
{76344}{76431}Iizeki, this is the film from the camera.
{76491}{76596}Of course... This looks like|two typical newlyweds...
{76672}{76717}What is that?
{76761}{76942}Doctor, could that be a flying saucer?|It looks a lot like... an animal.
{77809}{77896}Is that it?|-There's no mistake. It's a Pteranodon.
{77903}{77998}Haiyama... If it is, it's travelling very fast.
{78008}{78076}But wasn't this photograph taken recently?
{78085}{78314}The Pteranodon roamed the earth about two|million years ago. How could it be captured on film?
{78322}{78479}But is this a Pteranodon? Do you mean one of them|lives in the mountain and no one knows about it?
{78489}{78595}After all that, you expect|me to believe such a thing?
{78597}{78683}Yes. The characteristics are|the same as in this photo.
{78829}{78930}If one still exists, what|can we do to catch it?
{79035}{79072}Go ahead...
{79767}{79958}Shigeru, look at them. They're so|cute. Do you knowwhat they are?
{84731}{84832}Shigeru! Shigeru!
{85359}{85454}Kio!|-Shigeru!
{85464}{85606}Kio... I... What did l...
{85669}{85828}Shigeru... you're out|of danger! You are...
{85942}{86021}That's it... There's no doubt about it.
{86170}{86203}Thank you!
{86286}{86401}This was the thing that was eating|the creatures inside of the mountain?
{86410}{86662}Yes. I saw it with my own eyes...|This thing was eating them.
{86669}{86772}Alright, I know what we|have to do. Come with me.
{89173}{89217}Incredible...
{90392}{90511}This is it. I'm certain|this is where the egg was.
{90519}{90630}If it is Kamura, why aren't|there any remnants of the egg?
{90718}{90869}The cave-in may have covered|it up. It could have...
{91198}{91289}Doctor, this is it!|This is part of the egg!
{91296}{91348}This is part of the egg?|-lt is.
{91483}{91529}Hey, it's a cave-in!
{91578}{91652}Hey! Get out! Hurry!
{92096}{92135}The tests are completed.
{92163}{92221}The results are very good.
{92228}{92282}Percent data?|-Ninety percent.
{92313}{92520}Really? Judging from the cell structure, I'd say|this creature was reptillian. See for yourself.
{92713}{92827}Of course... The egg matches perfectly.
{92835}{93027}The problem is guessing the size of the egg|based on the inner curve of this section.
{93645}{93864}I can't believe the size of this egg. You might hear|about an egg like this in the book, "Arabian Nights"...
{93930}{94112}You'd think an egg like that came from space.|But for nature to produce an egg like that...
{94122}{94208}This egg is a product of|both nature and man.
{94297}{94384}I don't think this will|determine its final size.
{94392}{94447}But, you...|-No, thank you.
{94454}{94500}This confirms my theory.
{94646}{94920}To repeat, this Pteranodon is a life form|that is alive due to unusual circumstances.
{94928}{95045}We have determined that this creature|is part of the species called Rodan.
{95053}{95333}Its wingspan will reach 270 meters and it will|weigh one hundred tons when fully grown.
{95467}{95650}The Rodan's strength was discovered to be|similar, but more powerful that its cousin's.
{95660}{95850}It's a sonic boom. Since it flies at supersonic speeds,|it's natural that its wings create the phenomenon.
{95949}{96033}Professor, I have a question.|-Go ahead.
{96079}{96225}If a Rodan is among us now, has the|Professor thought about how it survived?
{96330}{96448}I have a theory regarding that question.
{96518}{96774}From what I've concluded, radiation and atomic|bombs may have been the spark that gave it life.
{96782}{97073}It may have seeped into the caverns from the outside|and this new energy revived Rodan from its stasis.
{97080}{97128}That's what I think.
{97159}{97281}But... could that be all?|-No, there may be other factors...
{97293}{97365}But I haven't fully explored them yet...
{97390}{97565}Professor, the real problem is where do we|begin our search for Rodan. Is there one spot?
{97626}{97819}There's no doubt... Near these coal mines and|in this general area would be the likely spot.
{97830}{98034}It would go beyond these two areas if|there were a drought or shortage of food.
{98041}{98126}This should be enough|of an area to begin.
{99231}{99267}What's that?
{99410}{99507}That's it! That's definitely it!|That's the thing I saw!
{99848}{99921}Alright! Head back|and inform headquarters!
{101268}{101382}What?! Rodan is coming?|Right, I understand!
{104663}{104702}Damn!
{104871}{104921}Jets two and three are left!
{104947}{105095}Base, base. This is limura.|Rodan is still in the air.
{105101}{105198}Alright... Continue pursuing the monster!|Continue pursuing the monster!
{105211}{105244}Roger, roger!
{106352}{106390}Over there!
{107596}{107783}Everyone, please make your way to|the buses! Hurry! Go to the buses!
{108060}{108085}Let's go!
{109013}{109056}We did it!
{111021}{111194}Rodan is changing course. We have scored|at least one hit. Its speed is down to half.
{112375}{112420}Here it comes!
{113078}{113149}Hurry! Hurry, hurry!|Quickly! Quickly!
{114402}{114470}Order our forces to attack|it while it's on the ground!
{114507}{114635}Mobile armored units, move into|position while it's attacking the city.
{114642}{114718}Open fire on Rodan as|soon as you are able.
{120932}{121069}There's another! There isn't just one!|We have sighted a second Rodan!
{121075}{121109}Over there!
{121186}{121277}I see the second one!|It's coming from the ocean!
{121283}{121333}Have all available units begin|attacking the one in the air!
{121336}{121399}Yes, sir! I'll order an|air assault right away!
{122675}{122757}How's the battle going?|-Take a look! One of them did this.
{122769}{122854}Incredible! And Rodan?...
{122884}{122951}He got away.|-Got away?!
{122985}{123081}It's not from this area. I think it|went back to where it had hatched.
{123768}{123921}It's unusual, but our intelligence doesn't|know where either of the Rodan's could be.
{123930}{124013}Do you think the two have left the area?
{124019}{124142}No. I'm certain that both Rodan's|are in the Mount Aso region.
{124155}{124194}Mount Aso region?
{124223}{124396}The truth is, these animals are assisting each|other. They'll stay in a place that's easily defended.
{124415}{124600}If we were to use the camera film as testimony,|I'd say that they were staying in that area now.
{125130}{125177}We are in the area now.
{125185}{125221}Please take us down.
{125605}{125688}There it is!|-Ah! We've found one!
{125835}{125946}Professor, you were right!|-Yes. It's a splendid bird.
{126300}{126523}Unit number one will concentrate|their attack in this vicinity.
{126531}{126809}At the same time, unit number two will attack this|area. The explosions should bury both Rodan's.
{126815}{126926}Just a moment please. Could that|cause Mount Aso to erupt?
{126960}{127034}We don't believe that the|attack will cause an eruption.
{127040}{127184}It's not so absurd! How could you|ignore the possibility of it happening?
{127193}{127268}But...|-No I'm opposed to the idea!
{127280}{127433}Sugahara, of course there is always some|kind of risk in an operation like this.
{127448}{127598}That's not what I'm talking about.|The people... Their livelihoods...
{127604}{127783}Listen, what would happen to the Kyushu|area if we allowed the Rodan's to live?
{127792}{127932}Unless you have a better idea, we|cannot be bothered by such complaints!
{130337}{130671}Headquarters, this is command outpost.|We have three platoons ready to attack. Over...
{130675}{130818}Yes, this is Nishima. Yes. All of|our units are ready for the attack.
{130825}{130944}We will inform you when our|advance has stopped. Right. Roger.
{130984}{131052}Have unit one set their position|and prepare to attack.
{131055}{131126}Right. I'll contact unit one|and tell them to stand ready.
{131133}{131298}Unit number one, unit number|one, prepare to attack.
{131812}{131855}Kio!
{131983}{132042}Shigeru!|-You're not supposed to be here!
{132045}{132103}I know.|-Then why are you here?!
{132124}{132208}I don't know why I came. I'm sorry.
{132332}{132489}Thank you. It's dangerous out|here, so let's hurry inside.
{132904}{132970}Unit one is ready to attack!|-Open fire!
{132977}{133036}Yes, sir! Open Fire!|-Right! Open fire!
{133045}{133133}Open fire!|-Fire!
{135638}{135804}It's an emergency! The attack is affecting|the mountain. It may erupt at any time!
{135858}{135899}What do we do?
{135981}{136076}Alright... We'll continue our attack.
{138640}{138695}Unit number two is ready to attack!
{138719}{138803}Alright... Open fire!|-Open fire!
{140856}{140891}It's Rodan!
{145798}{145889}Give the order to cease fire.|-Give the order to cease fire.
{145964}{146105}All units are ordered to cease fire.

This is the salton sea
in Southern California.
A strange phenomenon, in which nature
has placed 400 square miles
of salt water in the middle of an arid desert.
In the desert, near the shore of the sea,
the government has established
one of its most important naval research bases.
At the laboratory on the secluded
south tip of the base,
top-secret atomic experiments
are carried out under rigid security control.
At the airfield, under the direction
of the parachute test unit,
planes leave on daily missions
for the jump area over the salton sea,
where Navy men dive in the government's
continuous researching of parachutes,
to meet the ever-increasing demands
of modern flight.
On may 17, in the early afternoon,
an earthquake occurred in the desert area.
Its force was strong enough to be felt
at the research base,
even though its epicenter was 10 miles away
in the wild rock formations 350 feet
below the surface of the salton sea.
However, less than 2 hours
after the earthquake,
the base was back to normal operating procedure.
Lt. Hollister, of the parachute test unit,
was preparing to make
the last-scheduled jump of the day.
Hollister was a veteran of over 300 test flights.
For him, this was to be one more routine jump.
Meanwhile, on the salton sea,
crewmen Johnson and Sanders
were headed out to meet lt. Hollister.
And for them,
this was to be one more routine pickup.
This is flutterboy 2-4-2 calling Navy 8-7.
You are now in sight. Over.
Hollister now
preparing to jump. Over and out.
He's down.
Navy 8-7, this is flutterboy 2-4-2.
Over.
This is Navy 8-7. Over.
He's in sight.
You're clear to return to the base. Over.
Roger. Leaving for home.
Over and out.
Flutterboy 2-4-2 calling land radio 4. Over.
Land radio 4. Come in.
Jumper landed safely.
He's down about 2-miles in,
off the southeast tip.
That's pretty far out. Hope this doesn't take all night.
Yeah, I'll call you back.
Where is he?
I don't know.
He's gotta be here.
I saw him hit.
Hey, lieutenant!
I'm going down for him.
You see him?
No. I'll try the other side.
Johnson?
Johnson!
Johnson!
Johnson!
Uh.
Ah!
Ah!
This is land radio 4 calling flutterboy 2-4-2.
Come in, please.
Land radio 4 calling flutterboy 2-4-2.
Come in.
Come in, flutterboy 2-4-2.
El centro base.
Naval intelligence, please.
Cmdr. Twillinger's office.
He's on the other line.
Okay, I'll put you on hold.
Lieutenant, I appreciate your calling, but there's nothing I can do.
He went awol, it doesn't matter what the circumstances were.
I'll have to refer the case.
Wait a minute!
In the 1 week that I've been here,
I've had a dozen different cases come up.
I don't decide these things.
I'm an investigating officer, not a judge.
All right,
I'll send you notification.
I know this guy. He's all right.
He made a mistake, but...
He sure did!
Commander, Wyatt on 3.
Wyatt?
He's our radioman at the salton sea pier.
Twillinger. Yes, Wyatt.
How long ago?
45 minutes.
No, I've lost radio contact.
It's not a mechanical failure at this end.
Have a boat standing by.
I'll be there in 5 minutes.
Trouble?
The last pickup crew hasn't reported in.
We'll have to go out.
Sally, wait until I call you.
Yes, sir.
Still there, mom?
Looks like ironheart's gonna work late again tonight.
That's right.
Shove off.
I don't see why they weren't covered for something like this.
They jump close to 20 men every day.
It's a good system, nothing goes wrong.
Something went wrong this time.
A boat off the port bow, sir.
She looks deserted.
Head up alongside.
Aye.
It's Sanders.
Check the water for the other men.
Yes, sir.
Sam.
Look at this.
What is it?
I don't know.
You better take a sample.
Have the lab run a test.
Commander, there's something surfacing on the portside.
It's Hollister.
Like I told you, he said he'd call me back later and that was all.
That's when you lost contact?
Yes, and I called the base.
When you talked last, was everything normal?
Yes. We was just kiddin', you know how you get on the phone.
That's against regulations.
Yes, sir.
Have a report in my office in the morning.
Yes, sir.
May I have that sample we took off the boat?
Right here.
How long's that autopsy on Hollister gonna take?
We'll have it early tomorrow.
I'll cover it for you.
Take some divers and go after Johnson in the morning.
It's too late to dive now.
Okay.
I want to take this to the lab.
It's right there.
Go through the main door and turn to your right.
I've already spoken to Dr. Rogers.
Good.
We won't need you anymore, Wyatt.
Thank you, sir.
That your new boss?
Yeah.
Sure is an eager beaver, sir.
Yeah, that he is.
You might know I'd be making eight carbons.
I said I'm always making eight carbons when my fingers go to...
Hello.
Is this Dr. Rogers' office?
Yes.
I'm cmdr. Twillinger.
I'll tell him.
I think you were notified that I was coming.
I was sorry to hear about the accident.
Young lady, you're not to discuss that with anyone. Do you understand?
No, of course not.
I'm Dr. Rogers, commander.
Twillinger.
Lt. Clemens said you have a substance to be analyzed.
I do. It's in here.
Come on, let's take a look at it.
Where did you find this?
On the boat, near the body.
Lt. Clemens told me what happened.
I'm terribly sorry.
We lost 3 men, so far.
At least, we think it's 3.
We've only recovered 2 bodies.
He said there was something unnatural about the condition of one of the bodies.
There was. It was shriveled.
Shriveled?
Sometimes seawater does strange things to human flesh.
In this case, I don't think so.
Would you say that the water in the sea could be radioactive?
Commander, let me answer you in this way.
My 2 assistants do a lot of diving related to our work.
I know that.
We don't take any chances with radioactivity.
Our sea experiments had nothing to do with what happened to your men or the condition of that body.
You might be wrong.
I've found that people are always jumping to wild conclusions concerning atomic reaction.
Science fact and science fiction are not the same.
Not in the least.
Just take a few minutes.
Can you make it as fast as possible?
It'll only take a little while, as long as I'm not interrupted.
I'll be outside.
Gail, I'm returning your child in the same condition as when I got her. I think.
Hi, sweetie.
Hi, mommy.
Excuse me.
It's all right.
May I go look at the rabbits?
Not today, sweetie.
Please. Hm-mmm.
Mommy, of all those rabbits, i like grace the best.
You can't see her today.
That's okay,
I've got a ladybug to keep me company.
Gail, when will the boys be finished?
They got tied up because of the earthquake and had to reset all the tests.
Oh.
Hey. 2 minutes.
Your wife and unborn child are starving.
A minute and a half.
What a life!
Did I ever tell you that I detest this lab?
That husband of mine even has "top secret" stamped in red ink in the middle of his chest.
He does. "Secret, secret, secret."
You can't speed up science.
I guess not.
Would you like to hold my ladybug?
Hmm?
I said, "would you like to hold my ladybug?"
Certainly. It's a privilege.
Honey, don't bother him.
That's all right.
Doesn't she have pretty spots on her back?
Yes, she has.
Commander?
It's just a simple marine secretion, although there is something that puzzles me.
I'd like to run another series of tests on it tomorrow.
I'll call you.
I'll wait for your call.
You can get me on 254.
That's right.
My ladybug.
You forgot my ladybug!
Maybe it's on the floor somewhere.
Don't worry about it.
Sandy, you can find another ladybug.
But I don't want another one, mommy.
I tell you what, when I get home,
I'll see if I can find her.
If I do, I'll bring her back, okay?
Okay.
He's cute.
I guess so.
Did you mention that you were available?
Somehow it didn't come up.
If I were you, it would have.
You're a character.
Ready to go home now?
I guess so.
I'm leaving now, doctor.
'Night.
Excuse me.
That's okay.
Just consider me a piece of furniture.
Sandy, come here.
Look. I've got a surprise for you.
I found her for you.
Thank you.
I'll give her a good talking to.
I wouldn't be too severe on her.
Thank you very much.
You're welcome.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Cmdr. Twillinger?
That's right.
Nate brown.
How do you do?
You know Josh Peters, sheriff's office.
We've met.
I've been with this office for 15 years, but I've never seen anything like this.
Have you, Josh?
Afraid not.
I've seen a lot of people die in different ways.
What caused it?
It's hard to tell.
A puncture wound, I think.
Both bodies taken from the sea were totally drained of blood and water.
What would make that happen?
I have no idea.
The wound could've been made by any sharp object and naturally the body would bleed.
But simple bleeding wouldn't cause this.
It happened near the research lab?
Yes. But they say there's no connection.
Maybe.
Take a look at the microscope.
You're looking at a piece of skin.
Usually when a body is left in water, the epidermal tissues become swollen.
But this is like leather.
It doesn't even resemble human skin anymore.
Skin on a man over 100 would have
3 times the amount of moisture.
What about the other man we found on the boat?
A stroke.
A stroke?
There's a technical name for it, but that's what it amounts to.
I don't understand you.
What could cause a stroke in a man that young?
In that age group, only 2 things could cause a stroke:
Violent anger or fear.
You can rule out anger.
Hm-mmm.
In my opinion, the man you found on the boat was literally scared to death.
Do you have enough deputies to post a quarantine on all the beaches until we find out what happened out there?
Yeah. I'll get right on it.
Good.
Thanks again for your help.
Not at all.
You boys care for a sandwich?
Got tuna fish and minced ham on rye.
No, thanks.
It's nice and cold.
Close the beach? I got
22 people staying here.
Sorry, we've got orders.
Nothing we can do.
That's swell. So everybody should go home, is that it?
Did you look at the temperature today?
Yes, we know it's hot.
120 at 3:00. So nobody swims.
What's wrong with the water?
We got a bulletin, Mr. Davis.
That's all we know!
Okay.
Dr. Rogers' office.
Yes, commander. Just a moment.
Dr. Rogers,
cmdr. Twillinger on line 1.
Yes, commander.
Yes, we're working on it.
We hope to have something, late today or tomorrow.
Tomorrow! Look, doctor, that's the only clue we've got.
I could have sent it to San Diego by now.
Hold on, commander, don't pressure us.
We don't need it.
I'll call you as soon as I finish.
I'll be in my office.
I've just been read the riot act by our friend from naval intelligence.
Don't let him bother you,
I'll give you a character reference.
I'm ready to run a geiger count on the stuff from los Alamos.
Good, go ahead.
That's strange.
Is that the stuff from the boat?
Yes.
What's it register?
And your last reading on the salton sea?
Normal, 0.034 constant.
That's odd. This is from the same water.
Why the difference in the radioactivity?
We'd better run a check test.
Hello, Larry.
Mrs. Simms.
Bob. What'll it be?
We'd like to talk about your beach.
About my beach?
I'm going now, ma.
All right. Jody.
Jody!
Yes.
Who you going out with?
You know.
I said, "who?"
Morty.
Morty.
Sure, I might have known.
I got nothing against servicemen, but that morty's no good.
You hear that?
I hear.
Ma, look at me.
I'm a big girl now. Grown up.
Can't you understand that?
You won't pay attention to me anymore.
That isn't what I mean.
I don't want to hurt you.
But there are times when I've got to use my own judgment about things.
It has to be that way.
Please try to understand.
All right.
Just you get home early.
I will.
I got a terrible headache.
I'm sorry, ma.
Goodnight.
You were saying?
About your beach.
I'm afraid you'll have to close it up temporarily.
No swimming.
Mort?
Mort?
Where you been?
Ma, she's...
Ma what?
Nothing.
She's screaming at everybody tonight.
Forget it.
Pretty girl. Ha.
Pretty girl, where's your suit?
Underneath, silly.
It's sure a beautiful night.
Did you get a look at that moon?
Catch me.
Come on. I'll race you to the float.
You haven't got a chance.
Morty.
Morty?
Mort.
Mort.
Ah.
Ah! Ah!
Ah!
I'll tell you what happened.
That boy ran off somewhere with Jody.
I know it.
He's no good.
I warned her. I said,
"why don't you go out with a nice young man?"
But no, she's just like her father was:
No sense.
The boy didn't report back to the base at all last night.
Are you sure he was with your daughter?
Of course I'm sure.
Did you see him?
I didn't have to see him.
Jody herself told me she was going out with him.
Uppity as you please.
And after all I've sacrificed and done for her, not a word of appreciation.
You'd think that at least she'd...
May we take a look around?
No, go ahead.
Her room's in there.
Let me have it.
No, give it.
Wait a minute.
I don't care. Give it to me.
It's mine, I found it.
There's some kids out there with a sailor's cap.
What?
Some kids.
What do kids got to do with it?
I don't know.
Give it to me.
I don't care.
Come here. Just a minute, son.
Let me take a look at that cap.
Did you find this cap?
That boy, Freddy, was trying to take it from me.
Yes.
Where'd you find it?
Over there.
It don't belong to nobody.
It don't belong to you, does it?
No, it doesn't.
Will you show me where you found this cap?
Come on.
There.
What's that?
A uniform or at least part of one.
Did your daughter and her boyfriend ever swim here?
Swim? I don't know.
You don't think they could...
Jody!
Jody!
Oh.
Oh, baby!
I could cut out my tongue for the things I said to you.
Oh, baby.
Josh!
Josh!
What's up?
I don't know.
But that's the same thing we found on the side of the boat.
Dr. Rogers says it's highly radioactive.
I better call and have him investigate the bottom of the sea, before somebody else is killed.
Man, it's cold down there.
I'll get price to get you some coffee.
Do you want us to move out again?
No, not yet.
There's a rock formation i want to check with a geiger counter.
As soon as I fix my regulator.
Thanks.
Any sign of them?
Nothing. Those kids are probably off on a honeymoon.
I hope so.
That's it.
Thanks.
Okay, let's go.
Keep a sharp eye, will you?
Believe me, we haven't seen a thing, except a few fish the size of your left hand.
Fine. Just be careful.
Sure thing.
How rough does it usually get?
It depends on the wind.
As a rule, there's not much current.
Then if the bodies are down there, they'll be easy to find.
Should be. Unless...
Unless what?
I'd rather not conjecture.
Okay?
Yes, sir.
We've got you on the frequency.
Right.
We're still descending.
What's your depth?
40 feet.
60 feet. We're leveling off.
Good. Try a reading.
Doctor, I'm now checking
the rock formation.
Reading is normal.
Normal. Good.
What's the bottom like?
Doctor, about the same.
We're going down again.
It looks like there may be
some kind of cave out under us.
How deep are you?
80 feet.
Still dropping.
That's most unusual.
Why?
We've been over this area a dozen times, the maximum depth is 65 feet.
Don't take any chances.
Don't worry.
97 feet.
100.
125.
We've leveled off again.
I think we're at the bottom
of some kind of huge cavern.
We see some kind of peculiar object ahead.
Hang on.
Doctor, I get a reading of 1.038.
What is it?
I'm not sure.
Some kind of marine growth, I think.
Circular. About 6 feet.
Almost transparent.
We'll try to cut it loose.
I'll send down a net.
Lower the net, boys.
Okay. Take it up.
Is everything all right?
No problems.
We're still looking.
Hold off and come up till we check what's in the net.
Okay.
We've found the girl.
Can you get her up quickly?
It'll only take a minute.
Okay, but don't take any longer.
My tank.
What' s wrong?
Blake's tank is caught
in the undergrowth.
Do you need any help?
No, we're okay.
Oh!
Johns!
Johns!
Answer me, Johns!
I'm okay. It got Blake.
What're you talking about?
I'm coming up. Get help.
Oh, my god.
What happened?
Oh, my god. His body.
He died right in front of me.
I couldn't help him.
I've got to go back.
Talk sense. What's down there?
I don't know, I never saw anything like it.
Like what?
A creature. A giant creature.
You're not going back down there.
Take your hands off me, i 've got to kill it!
I said, "you're not going back down!"
Stay out of this,
I'll take care of him.
There's no time for hysterics.
What are we fighting?
I don't know.
Was there just one of these creatures?
I think so. There was a cave, outside that thing.
An egg.
That must be one of its eggs.
Behind you!
The eye. Get the eye!
Keep those depth charges moving.
Hurry up, boys, we don't have much time.
The commander wants to leave in 5 minutes.
The Pentagon is sending admiral greenhouse for the conference.
Good. We're keeping the egg in the lab under observation.
We should know more about it by then.
I issued a press release saying the Navy is conducting routine tests with underwater explosives.
That should cover us for the moment.
No sense in starting a panic.
Excuse me, sir.
They're about finished loading.
You want to take a look?
Be about 5 minutes, doctor. Excuse me.
Would you sign these?
Did you get a hold of Connie?
No, but I left word for her to come down here.
Thank you.
If you have any problems, let us know.
The chief of staff has authorized full cooperation.
We'll see you in the morning.
Thank you, captain.
What's going on?
Did Mars finally invade us?
Another secret?
Where's George?
Where's George?
Connie, I couldn't help it.
Where's George?
What's happened to my husband?
Connie, step in here with me for a moment.
Where's Dr. Rogers?
He's in the radio shack.
He's with Connie.
Oh.
We're about ready to shove off.
Leave them alone, please.
Are you all right?
I'm fine.
I don't think you are.
What's wrong?
I should be with Connie, telling her how you get over it.
The trouble is, you don't.
I mean, I didn't.
Would you like a cigarette?
No, thank you.
When tom was killed, they said all those things to me.
Tom?
My husband.
I'm sorry, I didn't know.
It's funny, you go around for days and you don't believe it.
You think it can't be true.
And one of those days you get to thinking,
"it is true.
He isn't coming home."
And you say it out loud,
"he isn't coming home."
Don't listen to me,
I'm over it now.
It was 2 years ago.
I couldn't go in there with Connie.
Not right now.
What did your husband do?
He was a pilot.
He was stationed in San Diego.
Sandy and I moved here afterwards.
It takes a great deal of courage to start over.
I had a lot of happiness, a lot of things to think about and remember.
And I had Sandy.
I couldn't fall apart.
I guess not.
You know something?
You're easy to talk to, and I didn't think you would be.
Gail.
Yes, doctor.
Would you take care of Connie, please?
Of course.
We're waiting for you, doctor. How is she?
She's resting.
She'll be all right.
Good.
Men, Dr. Rogers has some final instructions for you.
Everything that's happened, or that will happen on this expedition, is classified
"top secret." Is that clear?
We've crippled and may have killed this giant creature.
To make sure it's dead, we're going to saturate the area with depth charges.
But our most important job is to find all its eggs.
Once they're located,
Dr. Johns will make a quick survey of them and then they must be totally destroyed.
Cmdr. Twillinger will be in charge of the underwater demolition.
I guess that's all.
All right, men. Let's go.
Believe me, it's best for you to stay here tonight.
I've got plenty of room.
What are they doing?
Come on.
What you see here is the formation inside the egg sac we found near the creature's lair.
You'll notice the shell is beginning to harden.
There's quite a bit of definition in the head.
Until our studies are completed, we're keeping it alive by controlled water temperature.
You'll notice that the thermostat reads
38 degrees exactly.
Is there any danger that the egg might hatch?
No, the temperature is low enough to keep it from hatching.
As long as this knob is set so the temperature remains constant, there'll be no problem.
I see.
Gentlemen, we believe that this creature is of the same family as the historically documented kraken.
A giant sea beast that was the direct ancestor of the modern water mollusk.
I've had some film of common mollusks flown in from San Diego.
I'd like you to compare it with the creature that attacked us.
Dr. Johns?
Yes. Right this way, please.
Sheriff, would you cut the lights, please?
As most of you know, the mollusk family is comprised of animals with a soft body usually covered by a hard shell.
This is gonaxis kibweziensis.
It's one half inch in diameter.
You'll note the similarities between it and the giant creature in the salton sea.
For example, the gonaxis has a predatory nature.
It attacks other living creatures, will devour them, eat their flesh.
The larger it is, the larger its appetite.
This is a branch of the gonaxis, the euglandia.
It shreds the flesh of its victim with scissor-like teeth.
Some species suck out the body fluids in much the same manner as the creature with which we're dealing.
As I mentioned, most of these creatures live entirely in the water.
But it's not unusual to find them on land, searching for food.
The same thing is true of our kraken.
These mollusks are only recently hatched, yet they're as large as the adult.
The reason being that they developed to full growth within the egg sac.
From the instant they're born, they're hungry.
That bubbly secretion you see is formed in the digestive system.
It acts as a defensive weapon.
Incidentally, it's chemically similar to the secretion we found on the boat.
That'll give you an idea.
It's interesting, but what's the point?
The creature was killed and all the eggs were destroyed.
That's right, but we're not sure we destroyed all the other creatures.
Do you think that more than one has developed?
We're sure of it.
From the number of shells in these photographs,
I'd say there are at least 10 of these giant creatures, each one with the capacity to lay several thousand eggs in its life cycle.
There was a cave here which we sealed with explosives and probably trapped the rest of them inside.
We have to be sure, doctor.
That's impossible, because the mouth of that cave is covered with tons of rock.
If any did escape, it will have to surface sooner or later.
It won't find enough food in the salton sea, it'll get hungry.
We can keep a 24-hour beach patrol.
Yes, I think that's imperative.
But our real danger doesn't lie at the sea.
Let's remember that these creatures can travel overland, too.
A few miles from here is the all-American canal system, which irrigates the entire imperial valley and then in time empties into the Gulf.
I don't want to alarm you unduly, but if just one of these creatures lived and got by the patrols, into the canal system and multiplied, the species could threaten the entire world.
First, devouring all life in the oceans and then, foraging on land.
Can you imagine an army of these things descending on one of our cities?
What caused it?
Where'd they come from?
We don't know, we can only guess.
Perhaps you saw this article here in life.
A few miles from here, this lakebed existed in a dry state, void of life for many years.
Then a flash flood filled it with about 2 feet of water.
In a few days, there were millions of shrimp in that lake.
They hatched from dormant eggs that were there for centuries.
I believe the same thing happened here.
I think that a pocket of eggs from this prehistoric species was trapped here, below the bottom of the salton sea.
Suppose an earthquake caused a fissure to open at the bottom of the sea, allowing water to seep down to this pocket.
Because this water was slightly radioactive, and because the eggs had a capacity to absorb this radioactivity, they found an environment that was perfect in which to hatch and grow.
Then a more severe earthquake widened the fissure, allowing these creatures to escape into the sea.
I'd like to alert the civilian defense.
Mr. Patterson, there are
100,000 people in this valley.
A move like that would lead to hysteria.
I suppose that's true.
I think we should set up a joint patrol around the sea, combine your staff with the sheriff's office, set up a headquarters at the air base and coordinate from there.
Does that sound practical to you?
Yes, sir.
How about your office, sheriff?
Sounds fine to me.
I'm due to report back to joint chiefs of staff.
I'll tell them that even if there are some surviving creatures, there's still no national danger.
Unless, as you said, some escape from the sea into the all-American canal.
That's correct.
I'll be in touch with you, commander.
Call me if anything develops.
Very good, sir.
Good day, gentlemen.
Good day. Good day.
The governor advised me to offer you any assistance you may need.
We appreciate that very much, thank you.
Yes, doctor.
I think we'd better meet in my office to set this up.
Okay.
Good night.
Good night.
Gail, how's Connie?
All right. She's staying with me for a while.
Good.
I feel kind of embarrassed today, commander.
Why?
The personal things i said yesterday,
I hope I didn't embarrass you.
You didn't.
I don't usually carry on that way.
You ought to, at least once in a while.
We're on our way back to the base now, and we have to eat sometime.
What I mean is, why don't you let me take you to dinner tonight?
I found a wonderful place to eat in mexicali.
Thank you, but i can't leave Connie.
I mean, I shouldn't.
Okay.
I'm awfully sorry.
If you should change your mind...
I never do.
If you should, the number's 254.
You already have it.
So I have.
Good night.
Good night.
Anything happening?
Nothing. Nothing but moonlight.
Wallace and hanson will replace you at 10:00.
Thanks.
Okay.
That about ties it up.
This reminds me of last year.
We had a stakeout on a federal bank for 3 months.
What happened?
Not a thing.
You sure you won't come home and take potluck?
Jenny wouldn't mind.
Much.
No, come on!
No, I'll get something from the cafeteria.
Okay, see you later.
You bet.
This is just like that federal bank stakeout last year.
The only trouble is, nothing ever happens.
No, mom.
I don't know. Yes, I'll hurry.
No, I don't know how late.
This is Walker, section 5 north. All clear.
Check.
Oni, twillinger.
Hi.
I had to come to town with some reports for the doctor.
I know it's past dinnertime, but if you hadn't already eaten, I...
Yeah, I'm starving.
Where are you?
Right, I know where it is.
I'll be there in 5 minutes.
Right, goodbye.
I'll check with you in half an hour.
Okay.
You can take mine, too, please.
You certainly don't eat very much.
I don't know how you keep going.
I had a big lunch.
That reminds me,
I'd better check in to base again.
Excuse me.
Nothing's happened so far, nothing at all.
Did you make a wish?
Yes.
I've got a confession to make.
I bet I know what it is.
You're still hungry.
No.
What I said about coming into town wasn't true.
I went home and Connie felt like being alone so that made me feel lonely, too.
So I decided to call you.
That's not a confession, that's a compliment.
You want a ballpoint pen, senor?
What?
Very cheap, senor. 8 pesos.
Big bargain.
No, thanks.
Si!
No.
Much ink inside.
No, thank you.
She will write 2 million miles, no refills.
How much is 8 pesos?
65 cents.
All right, bud.
You got yourself a deal.
Thank you, senor.
Hey, kid, my pen!
What are you grinning at?
Twill.
What's so funny?
That kid walked off with my money.
Your face. You're so serious.
Big bargain.
You're really much too serious.
Maybe you're right.
But I don't think you're like that underneath.
What did you want to do when you were little?
First, I wanted to be a fireman, and then a forest ranger, then I guess i wanted to be a cop.
Really?
Mm-hmm.
Senor, look, you like red?
I got red, white, green, blue, red and white, black and white, green and red...
Blue and white.
No blue and white.
Red, red and white, black and white, green and red...
Look, I'll just take this one.
Go on, scoot. Shoo!
Thank you, senor!
Where were we?
You were just going to take me home.
I'm afraid it's getting very late.
It's only 10:15.
Want to stop at the four oaks for a beer?
I told Betty I'd come right home after our shift.
So you'll be half an hour late.
Take the canal cutoff and we'll be there in 5 minutes.
Check that car ahead.
You better take a look.
Yeah.
What happened? What's wrong?
It. It was...
Better get him to the hospital.
Radio headquarters. Right.
No! Mary Jean.
Mary Jean.
It could have gone a dozen different ways.
Every half-mile, there's a junction and the locks roll open.
I don't understand.
Did you check all the patrols on the sea?
Yes, they're certain nothing got past them.
It's 23 miles from that sea to that canal, and there's no connection by water.
I just got a report.
A farmer 15 miles from here found
2 of his cattle dead.
Shriveled up.
He thinks they were attacked about 10:00 last night.
We know that the boy and girl were attacked here at 10:00.
Of course. There must be an underground river through which they escaped.
A river that leads from the sea to one of the pools near the canal area.
They leave this pool at night, and come around the canals in search of food.
We'll have to patrol the entire canal system.
There's 700 miles of canal bank in this county alone.
That could take us days.
We don't have days.
The egg at the lab was almost hatching when we got it.
We must find their new nest, before they lay any more eggs.
I'll call air national guard.
Their helicopters will work with ours.
We'll check every pool in this valley for their secretion.
Good. Because the possibility of finding one pool out of thousands is remote.
There's the chance that there may be an old survey map that shows where this underground river empties into the pool.
Doctor, if there is such a map, we'll find it.
Come on, we'll use our car.
This is helicopter 2-5, reporting in.
We have covered south basin.
There is no sign of target pool.
Bearing south-southeast.
Well, now, we gave most of our map collection to the library.
We've already been to the library.
We've checked every possible source.
You're our last resort.
Too bad.
We don't have many documents.
We don't have room for them.
We put up a bond issue, proposition 14-a, specifically asking for a document room.
Here.
Here we are.
Is this all you have?
I'm sorry.
Just not a speck of room.
Mr. dobbs, this is very important.
Have you heard of an underground river or ancient waterway that runs through the valley that would empty into a deep pool?
Dear, let me think.
I can't think of a thing.
But every once in a while, somebody dies and leaves us a whole lot of documents for our room, the one we didn't get, you understand.
Proposition 14-a was defeated.
If you hear anything, you can get me at the air base.
Air base?
Yeah, El centro.
Sure. I always cooperate with the authorities.
You'll find I'm a very cooperative person.
Thank you, Mr. dobbs.
Just call on me anytime. Night or day.
Give me Navy intelligence, please.
Oni, yeah.
Lock 23? Lock 23, okay.
46, okay, nothing sighted.
We still haven't spotted the pool where they've nested.
We have the entire irrigation system under patrol.
The gatekeepers at each lock are on 24-hour guard.
Someone is bound to spot one of those creatures.
When they do, we close all the locks and hold it till we arrive.
Then we'll follow it back to the pool.
Sounds like an effective plan.
I'll be in capt.
Master's office.
All right.
How many patrols have checked in?
The gatekeepers have called, except 3.
See if you can get them.
Right.
Sally, try locks 14, 32 and 57.
I'll call you back later, mom.
Lock 57.
Yes, I did try, but the line was tied up.
No, I haven't seen any creature.
Just plain foolishness.
Hey, boys!
Get away from there!
We don't allow no swimming here, you know that.
Go on, now.
Okay.
Don't go in there, Sandy.
We're going home now.
When can we go swimming again?
I don't know, dear.
Then can I go look at the rabbits?
Not today, sweetie.
Dr. Rogers' office.
Yes, just a minute,
I'll read you the figures on that.
That was 2-3-4-5.
Yes, and 5-4-2-3.
Hello, grace. How are you today?
We have to be very quiet, because mommy is so busy.
Poor grace. You're cold.
If I had a nice warm blanket,
I'd put it over you.
Maybe I can figure something out.
There. Is that better?
I gotta go now. Goodbye.
Fine. Goodbye.
Sandy?
Yes, mommy.
Let's go home.
Lock 41, okay.
41, okay.
Proceed eastward on highway 8-0.
Have you heard anything?
Not yet. We'll keep you posted.
What time were the boy and girl attacked last night?
9:30 or 10:00.
It's 9:00 now.
Yeah, I know.
Mm-hmm.
Hey, you kids!
Don't try to hide from me.
Hey, you kids!
Hey, you kids!
Still no answer.
When did you last talk to him?
At 8:00.
Do we have a car in that area?
There's one within half a mile.
You better call it.
Get moar and Walker in car 14.
Right.
This is control operations calling car 14.
This is Walker, car 14.
What've you got?
Proceed to
canal junction 57.
Repeat. Proceed to canal junction 5-7.
Right.
My god. I'll call in.
This is car 14 calling control operations. Over.
Come in, car 14.
Tell Josh we found
the gatekeeper dead,
just like the others.
Have them stay there.
Radio all the patrols.
Roger.
Close everything that leads to lock 57.
We'll try to hold it long enough to follow it.
Right. Sally, give me a line.
Commander!
Could I help you?
I'm here to see cmdr. Twillinger.
Will he be back?
Not for some time.
You just missed him.
I know. Well.
Is there anything I could do?
No.
I think maybe I better wait.
If it's all right?
He may be gone for hours, Mr...
Dobbs. Lewis Clark dobbs.
Mr. dobbs.
Well.
I'll wait.
That's right.
Close the locks south from juncture 302 to 23.
Right. And keep them closed till you hear from me.
I called in the minute i heard that noise.
I thought to myself,
"something's breaking out there."
"There's sure something breaking."
So I come out to see what it was.
And there it was.
Why weren't you out here?
The lock has an emergency release.
You could've stopped it.
Listen, commander,
I was only doing what they told me.
I didn't know you wanted to follow it.
You didn't?
Thanks, anyway.
I know how you feel, but it wasn't his fault.
Twill?
Yeah?
What do we do now?
Wait for another one.
Come on, let's go back.
Commander.
Lewis Clark dobbs.
Hello, Mr. dobbs. What is it?
It's probably not anything at all.
I see.
How's it coming, sailor?
The same, sir.
Nothing?
No, sir.
You said it was important, you know, about the map.
Yeah?
A very strange thing happened.
I was looking for these papers.
Actually, I was looking for this petition.
We're campaigning again for proposition 14-a, the one that was defeated, and there was this folder.
And in the folder, there was this map.
I remembered it because Mrs. de fauna de porto had asked me to take care of it, and then she passed on.
I told you about it, didn't I?
A very great loss.
You see, the de fauna de porto family settled this valley.
A most distinguished family.
Is this a river?
No. But the Indians dug Wells along there, apparently.
Here. It says here, in Spanish, of course,
"the Wells of life."
I read 18 foreign languages.
Clem!
Sir?
Any boys working in the photo lab?
Not now.
Get them down there right now.
I want this blown up and graphed.
Order me a helicopter at dawn and notify Dr. Rogers.
Right.
Drop us down a little.
That's the one.
How do you want to proceed?
We radio for equipment, then dive and destroy them.
Chances are they're dormant now, but any sound may attract them.
So set your charges and get out.
Right.
Are you ready?
Are you?
I think so.
Doctor, your lab's on the mobile phone.
Thank you. Yes, Gail.
I sent you those cylinders you asked for.
They should be there in 10 minutes.
Thank you. We may need them.
Hold on a minute.
Gail?
Yes, twill.
Hi!
Is everything all right?
Are you all right?
Everything's fine. Don't worry.
I'll call you later.
Okay. Twill?
Yeah?
Take care.
I always do.
Goodbye.
I'll take it.
I have you on the frequency.
We're moving through
a dense growth.
Can't tell what's ahead from here.
We've reached the bottom.
We've found them.
Any problems?
No,
I think we can get them all.
It took you
3 minutes to get down.
Allow yourselves
2 minutes leeway.
Will do.
We set the first charge.
The pin on my last charge
is stuck.
Twill, Johns is in trouble.
You're 30 seconds past safe time.
Start up.
You're 42 seconds past safe time.
Start up.
Are you on your way up?
Just a second.
We're on our way up.
You have 25 seconds.
Come on.
Let's help pull them up.
Hurry up.
You fellows all right?
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
I wanna make a check in half an hour, when the sediment clears.
All right.
I'm sorry about what happened down there.
You don't have to be.
I made a mistake.
When I signaled you,
I was sure the pin was loose.
Forget it, anyone's entitled to an honest mistake.
Anyway, you saved my neck.
Thanks.
Excuse me,
I've got a phone call to make.
It's a great relief knowing we got them all.
Yeah.
You know, I guess I was wrong about that guy.
The commander takes a bit of knowing.
Mobile operator.
Give me Dr. Rogers' office.
The Navy lab, salton sea, 2-2-1.
Johns is going to stay to load up.
Would you mind dropping me at the lab?
Sure, jump in.
I called Gail at the lab, but the line was busy.
Oh, really?
They're all down at the pool, sir.
Yes, I will.
Hi, honey.
Hi, mommy.
I got dressed by myself.
And a good job you did, too.
Have you had your orange juice?
Yes.
We'll have breakfast in a little while.
Why don't you go play?
Dr. Rogers' office.
I'm sorry, he's not here now.
I can take a message if you wish.
Yes, captain.
I'm sorry, he was called away.
Grace?
Ah!
Mommy!
Sandy!
Honey, stay where you are!
Mommy!
Mommy!
Don't move!
It's all right, honey.
Someone will come soon and help us.
Mobile operator.
Could you try the Navy lab again?
Salton sea, 2-2-1. That's right.
Still busy.
Want to stop and get some breakfast?
No, thanks.
I had toast and coffee when I got up.
But if you want to stop...
No, I can wait.
Sandy.
Do you see that window?
Yes.
Can you get up there?
Try!
I can't.
Try!
I can't!
Oh, god.
I want you to close your eyes.
I want you to close your eyes and put your head right there.
Don't open them for a little while.
Good morning, commander. Doctor.
Go ahead.
Gail!
Doctor!
Get help!
Get help!
Can you hear me?
Yes.
Can you hear me?
Yes.
Now listen, when I holler come out of there.
Now! All right. Now!
Here, take it easy now.
You're still shaken.
Yes, I am. But i feel all right now.
What about you?
I think I'm all right.
You're just fine, honey.
You know something?
You can go swimming again.
Can I?
Yes, ma'am, you can.

Space Control to SJ 1.
We read you. Copy.
Space Control. Space Control.
Come in, please. Come in, please.
Something's approaching us!
Space Control. Space Control!
Come in, please.
Look at that.
Hey, you!
Get on the S.O.S. right away.
- We're being attacked.
- Come in--
Space Control! Space Control!
BATTLE IN OUTER SPACE
We're running two minutes late.
We'll have to make it up.
Ai Diacho!
Hey! The bridge is out!
These are the headlines on your
Tokyo television news this morning.
They are both unexplainable events.
And now, for an even more curious news story...
...we switch you to our reporter in America.
This is your announcer,
Thomas Sheldon...
...with a special from New York.
The American freighter, Blue Queen...
...passing through the Panama Canal...
...was destroyed by a waterspout...
...which left her a pile of junk draped on the side of the canal.
The cause of this catastrophe is quite unknown.
And, while you hear my voice, this announcer in Venice, Italy...
...is telling his public about a similar occurrence this morning.
A powerful waterspout lifted tons of water from the canals of the city...
...flooding and destroying many age-old monuments.
In order to investigate these mysterious events...
...the World Council has called an emergency conference...
...to be held at the Space Research Center in Tokyo.
Delegates from various member nations...
...are scheduled to arrive this morning.
How do you do?
- Hi.
- How do you do?
Oh, it's so nice to see you again.
It is clear from an examination of the circumstances...
...resulting from these three disasters...
...that there was a common force at work in each instance.
The fact that the survivors were severely frostbitten...
...is of particular significance...
...indicating that extremely low temperatures...
...were somehow produced.
Now, what does this imply?
Simply that by rapidly lowering the temperature of a certain object...
...its gravity would also be decreased.
But isn't it impossible to remove gravity...
...from a stationary object or a certain place?
Yes, you are right.
You see, it's been considered impossible up to now.
But now it has happened right here on Earth.
And my colleagues,
Dr. Adachi and Major Katsumiya...
...have a brief analysis of some very interesting data on this subject...
...which I will ask them to explain to you.
As you know, the cause of gravity is the motion of atoms.
And when the atoms of an object have no movement...
...its gravity is correspondingly diminished.
At the temperature known as absolute zero...
...the atomic movement of an object is reduced to a state of rest...
...and it becomes weightless.
Owing to the centrifugal force of the revolving Earth itself...
...the object thus affected would rise up into the air.
We are sure that the recent disasters...
...were caused by an operation from space...
...of some sort of freeze ray, which...
...by reducing temperatures abruptly...
-...was able to destroy the gravity--
- Are you all right?
Don't worry. It's all right.
Hello, Dr. Achmed.
Has the conference ended?
Hold on, now.
What's this?
It's Dr. Achmed.
Dr. Achmed. Where is he?
Well, he isn't there now.
You must be seeing things.
Achmed's at the conference with everybody else.
But I'm sure. He was right there.
- Oh, there you are. Iwomura.
- Yeah.
Get the heat-ray gun set up.
Firing test.
Okay-
Say, Katsumiya.
I think Etsuko's a little overtired.
Try to cheer her up, huh?
If we acknowledge the fact...
...that the Earth has entered upon the space age...
...we must be prepared to admit that...
...just as we can go from Earth to the planets...
...there must be other beings whose intelligence is superior to ours...
...who have solved the problems of space better than we have.
Dr. Adachi, what do you think their purpose is in coming to the Earth?
Wouldn't you say they came here impelled by the same kind of...
...scientific curiosity we might feel about them?
Could it be they plan to conquer the people of Earth?
I only wish I knew the answers to these questions, gentlemen.
I couldn't care to guess what the future holds...
...though I'm sure we all hope that this is a peaceful visit.
Unfortunately, we do not understand their language.
But we should by all means possible continue to urge peace.
On the other hand, however, we should also study...
...measures to repulse them if attacked.
I hereby declare that this meeting is adjourned.
Inspector Iriake of the international police.
Gentlemen, this is our new ray gun.
It produces a narrowband energy radiation...
...of the order of 600 megatherms.
At maximum output...
...it will fire continuously for 20,000 hours...
...with a single charge of plutonium.
We have lined up a series of targets composed of beryllium 19...
...which is, as you are no doubt aware...
...the hardest metal produced here on Earth. this same alloy is being used for the skin of the Spip One...
...which is now under construction.
We're ready.
All right. Please stand back, gentlemen.
Here, gentlemen, are the results of the test firing you have witnessed.
These are our spaceships, the Spips.
Were they built in accordance with our original design?
Why, yes, exactly.
Why, do you find something wrong?
No, I think they're wonderful.
I have to confess, I am quite surprised.
I didn't think you could build them so quickly.
Well, we didn't do it alone.
All the nations in the world did it.
Well, it's marvelous all the same.
Congratulations, doctor.
- Yes, congratulations, doctor.
This way, gentlemen, this way.
We're mainly concerned with adjusting the instruments and controls...
...inside the ships. Actual firing is just a question of time now.
What is the deviation on the wave-motion index?
Well, here. I was just checking the figures on that, professor.
It's one to 100,000 in the atmosphere...
...and one to 1,000,000 in outer space.
- Kogure, are you ready?
- Ready.
Will you connect the meter leads from the engine room...
...to the master control? Thank you.
- You got it.
-Ready.
Now I'll test the motor on Spip number one.
Doctor, I am Inspector Iriake, international police.
- Can you give me some information?
- Why, yes, of course.
I'm looking for Dr. Achmed.
Can you find him?
I believe so.
He's around here somewhere.
Will you find him at once for me, then, please?
There are reasons for my haste which I can't explain at the moment.
Dr. Achmed.
He isn't here, doctor.
He didn't come with us.
Yamek. Yamek.
There's something wrong in the gun room.
What's going on here? Stop that.
The ray gun. I caught him.
He was trying to steal it.
Achmed, is that true?
How could you?
You're under arrest. Come with me.
You wanna get me, eh?
Well, come on!
Cowards, all of you.
Eventually, you'll be our slaves.
Achmed. No, don't. Wait.
Get back!
Get him!
Look. A flying saucer.
Where did he go?
Here, doctor.
Here are the pictures.
It's some kind of radio-controlled apparatus.
How atrocious.
Implanted in Achmed's brain.
It would make him respond to radio-wave impulses.
It is clear that the inhabitants of the planet Natal...
...have established an advance base on our moon.
And they are planning to attack the Earth from this base.
Mankind has lived on the Earth for the past 500,000 years.
Now he must be prepared...
...to resist the attacks of the interplanetary bandits...
...of outer space.
We are going to send two spaceships to the moon.
Dr. Adachi, the eminent scientist...
...will command the crew of the first ship.
Dr. Richardson will command the crew of the second ship.
And now, for the details of the flight.
Dr. Adachi, will you tell us something about that?
Well, of course, we have to consider this...
...as just a reconnaissance flight.
We expect to land at a point...
...100 kilometers north of the Sea of Rains.
Our radio telescopes indicate...
...that mysterious radio signals are being transmitted from that area.
Isn't it beautiful?
And there are creatures up there, about to attack us.
I know.
Yes, but it looks more beautiful...
...when you imagine that there's a--
A prince waiting up there...
...who's going to come down and carry you away, forever.
I think that we humans will gradually lose such feelings of beauty.
Katsumiya.
Isn't there one thing that will always be the same?
There must be one thing.
Don't you understand what I mean?
That there's one thing that we'll never lose.
We'll always love each other, no matter what happens.
On the Earth or on the moon.
Well, I guess...
I wonder...
No. I won't let it. It just can't.
Our love will never change.
Say that you'll love me forever.
Forgive me. I'm sorry.
I was just teasing.
Wait. Be careful, darling.
You really had us worried.
And the way you were making your sweetheart cry.
I worry about that.
- You were spying, huh?
- Oh, all right.
Let's all go to town.
How would you like that?
- Where?
- I'd like to have some fun.
There won't be any on the moon,
I know.
You can be sure of that.
That's right. So before we go,
I'd like to go kiss the girls goodbye.
- Do you want to come along?
- Why not?
I don't think so.
I'm doing all right here.
Watch out for that guy, Etsuko.
Well, I guess I'll go by myself.
See you later.
- Goodbye.
- See you later.
Be calm.
It is useless to struggle against us.
Have courage.
This will not hurt very much.
Now it is over.
We have implanted our life in your brain.
And you are now our slave.
Hereafter, you will do what we tell you to do.
We welcome you as a new servant...
...of the glorious planet Natal.
Now, go.
Go!
Hey, you.
Get a move on.
You can't park your car here.
What's wrong with you?
Your forehead's bleeding.
What happened?
There's a tremendous crowd here today...
...waiting for that moment when a brilliant new chapter...
...will be recorded in the annals of mankind.
Far across the spacious grounds of the Science Center...
...I can see the spaceships standing silently on their launching pads...
...waiting for the moment when they'll carry aloft...
...the hopes of the world.
Present...
...arms!
Order...
...arms!
The commander of the first ship will be Professor Richardson.
While Dr. Adachi commands the second ship.
Each crew consists of nine specialized technicians.
The launching pad.
The cars have stopped...
...and the crews are about to enter the elevators in the gantries.
The fueling of the ships has been completed.
Everything is in readiness for the takeoff.
In a few moments, the countdown will begin...
Everything is ready, sir.
Thank you.
Please be seated, gentlemen.
Report when ready for pref light checkout procedures.
Let him know that we are ready.
We are ready and starting countdown.
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm all right.
Would you request a report from number two ship?
You can say the second Spip is ready.
We are ready and counting.
Fueling completed.
Fueling number one completed, also.
Remove gantry.
Fifty seconds.
Forty seconds.
Ignite your primary burners on your own command.
Ignite your primary burners on your own command.
First stage, full power.
Full power. Mooring safeties released.
Ten, nine, eight, seven...
...six, five, four, three, two, one.
Fire.
- Good. Start space procedures.
- Space procedure.
- Reduce thrust to zero.
- Thrust to zero.
Well, gentlemen.
Looks like it's a success.
- International teamwork...
- Thank you.
Feels good.
You can release your belts now.
What happened? Well, don't just stand there, help me down.
You have to remember, there's no gravity on this ship.
- Yes, sir.
- You gotta be careful.
Put everyone on space procedure.
Well, doesn't this weightless feeling feel strange, Sylvia?
It certainly does, Roger.
Calling Spip number two.
Come in, please.
I want your cruising report. Over.
Spip number two calling Spip number one.
Skin temperature 361.
Normal fuel consumption.
Everything okay.
Space radar ready and go.
Space radar number one, space radar number one.
Unidentified object bearing 321, second quadrant.
This is radar two. We have unidentified object on same bearing.
What is it, doctor?
Are they enemy saucers?
We can't be sure yet.
Check it on the space scope.
Very well, sir. Get that scope out.
-321, second quadrant.
-321, second quadrant.
It's what's left of the satellite.
Let us say a prayer for them.
At 42 hours...
...the present position of our Spip...
...is 306,000 kilometers...
...and the attraction is .17.
Good.
How far to the moon?
Ten more hours, at the current rate.
It's 70,000 kilometers to the moon.
I get a signal from the moon.
And radar, how about it?
I don't have anything.
- What's wrong?
- Iwomura.
Iwomura.
What's wrong with him?
Hey. I've got something here.
Two pips.
I've got them on the space scope too, sir.
They're dead ahead.
They're gonna crash into us.
- Get the ray gun ready!
- Ray gun.
Ready, sir.
- What could they be?
- Some sort of guided missile.
Keep tracking closely, and fire when they're in range.
- Very good, sir.
- Prepare the ray gun.
It's ready, sir.
This is Spip number two.
We are prepared to give battle.
Contact.
Contact.
Listen, earthling.
Cut the power to the heat-ray gun.
Cut the power to the heat-ray gun.
Where's Iwomura?
I must have some help.
Okada. See what's happened to Iwomura.
Yes, sir.
More raiders coming in.
I've got them on the scope...
...and there are two saucers behind them.
Hey. Iwomura.
What are you doing? Hey, wait!
Fire!
- What's wrong with that ray gun?
- I can't locate the trouble.
What's happened to your power?
Check the oscilloscope.
We'll switch to the auxiliary generator.
What's wrong, number two?
They're going to ram you, they're going to ram you.
It's no use, doctor.
Prepare for evasive action.
- Very good.
- Get tied down.
- Correct our deviation at once.
- Yes, sir.
And find out what happened to that ray-gun generator.
Get the controls off the line.
- Over.
- Pull over.
What happened to him?
Okada, what's wrong with him?
I caught him working on the ray-gun generator.
He was shutting off the power.
What?
Put him here till he wakes up.
You earthmen are fools.
We warn you.
Do not approach the moon.
Do not approach the moon.
If you do, you will surely die.
Dr. Richardson, did you hear that?
Of course I did, but we can't very well turn back.
I agree with you that we must persevere.
To turn back now would mean complete defeat.
Listen well, earthmen.
We repeat our warning.
Do you want to die?
Obey our command and return to Earth.
- To your stations, men.
- Yes, sir.
They're running back to their moon base.
- Hadda.
- Yes, sir.
Iwomura seems to be in shock.
Try to make him comfortable, at least.
Right.
We're in the moon's gravity field now.
Start your reverse.
Full reverse thrust.
Stop and turn around.
How can I? We'll be a perfect target for those enemy missiles.
I know that.
Notify number two.
Hello, number two.
We're going to reverse propellant.
Hold on.
This is Adachi, professor.
The fate of the entire world depends on us.
We must proceed with our landing on the moon.
Roger.
Excuse me, sir.
In order to escape radar detection...
...we'd better land as close as possible to the mountain in section six.
Yes, you're right.
We are changing our point of impact...
...to the east side of the mountain in section six. Do you agree? Over.
Very well, then. The east side of the mountain in section six. Over.
Roger. Over and out.
Landing stations.
- He's out of harm's way now.
- Good, strap in.
Yes, sir.
Rate of descent, zero.
Azimuth, 1-0.
We are directly above the mountain.
Altitude, down and slow.
Roger.
Reverse altitude.
Altitude, 105.
Our approach angle is 109.
Increase thrust, 10 G.
She's down.
Secure the ship and prepare to land.
Cut your turbines, Okada.
- Okada.
- Huh?
Make sure Iwomura can't do any harm.
Do you want me to tie him up?
- It would be better for everyone.
- All right.
- Check your oxygen.
- Don't worry, I checked. It's all right.
- Turn around, let me check yours.
- It's all right, isn't it?
- Good shape.
- Just a minute, check the radio.
Radio working? Can you hear me?
- Yes, I hear you.
- Very well, then, let's go.
Dr. Adachi, what was the matter with Iwomura?
He is a victim of the enemy's brain wave. We have to leave him here.
Welcome!
Oh, look, the Earth!
Oh! Help, help!
Help me! Help me!
Look, you have to be careful.
I told you.
The gravity here is much less than it is on Earth.
Well, Dr. Adachi, we finally made it.
Yes, we finally did, but our work is just beginning now.
We've got to find those flying saucers so we can destroy them.
So good hunting, and let's keep together.
We're ready.
Wake up. Wake up.
You haven't completed your mission yet. Wake up!
I get a radio bearing...
...almost due north of here.
Good.
- Try to keep track of it.
- Let's go after it.
Yes. New heading, 30 degrees fight.
Get in the observation dome.
Ground car to Spip One.
Is everything in order?
Everything in order here, sir.
Listen well, earthman.
Your mission is to blow up these spaceships.
You must blow them up.
Do it quickly!
Flying saucers!
They must be watching us now.
Be careful.
Right.
- Get number two car.
- Yes, sir.
Did you see the flying saucers?
Yes, we just saw them now. They seem to be following us. Be careful.
Don't worry, we will.
Dr. Adachi, have you noticed the barometer?
- Look at the atmospheric pressure.
Check the air-cushion system.
Air-cushion system okay.
Cushions on.
- Hello, doctor.
- Hello, professor.
You must hurry.
Time is running out.
Flying saucers! Take cover!
They've come from a station hidden on the other side of those mountains.
Yes.
The only thing is, we'll have to find out where it is.
We'd better go on foot.
We'll have to leave the cars here...
...and go on foot to search for the enemy base.
Reactor working.
Radar working.
- How much further is it?
- I don't know, let me see.
- Here's where we are.
- Another thousand yards.
Close the cooler valve.
And now the other one.
Hey! Look at that.
It's a tunnel!
Look in there! This must go right through the mountain.
It must be an entrance to the enemy base.
Kogure!
Go bring up the number one car!
Okay-
Very good, Iwomura.
Now do the same to the other ship.
Blow it up, keep moving, go ahead!
This is the base from which they plan to launch their attack on Earth.
Then we must destroy it.
It doesn't seem to be completed yet.
There must be some way to destroy it, if we could only find out how.
Doctor, let me try to sneak in.
That's out of the question.
I could destroy at least a part of it.
He's right, and I want to go with him.
The longer we wait, the less chance we have of succeeding.
Let me go with them.
Let's go.
Tell Kogure to get the heat-ray cannon up here right away.
All right.
And be careful, please.
I will.
I'm going to move in on their base now, all right, doctor?
No, not yet. Wait until the heat-ray cannon gets here.
- I heard Etsuko scream.
- You better go after her.
Yes, sir.
Katsumiya! Save yourself!
Etsuko!
Let her go!
Etsuko! Where are you!
Here.
Come this way!
No, no, save yourself!
Earthmen, you have ignored our warning.
Now you can no longer return home.
You shall become our slaves.
Lay down your arms and surrender.
Yourself!
The dog! I'll make it stop! I'll kill it!
No, wait. The fire from your gun won't help us very much.
This is your last chance.
We will attack...
...if you do not surrender...
...within 10 seconds of Earth time.
One.
- Two.
- Out of the way! Get back.
Three.
Careful, now.
Fire!
Four.
Now, hurry.
You haven't much time.
- Let's get out of here!
- Everyone, back to the car.
- Let's go!
- Quickly, give me a hand!
Hey, doctor!
Captain! Look at that!
It's burning inside.
It's the other car. Katsumiya!
He did it! He destroyed the dome!
What's that? What should I do?
What"?
What did I do?
- Oh, Etsuko!
- Katsumiya is waiting.
- Very good! Come along!
There's no time to lose.
Hurry, hurry!
- Here they come. Quickly.
- Move it out!
- Go on, quickly, move it out!
- This way! This way!
-Into the cars, move.
- Easy, easy, watch it.
- Careful with the guns.
- Move those guns into the cars!
- Anybody left in there?
- Come on, come on, get in.
Come on, doctor, get in.
I wonder what happened to those saucers that flew away.
There isn't very much to worry about there with their home base destroyed.
I only hope they don't get to our ships before we do.
- The air pressure's dropping.
- You're right.
Twenty-three, two, one.
Twenty. Nineteen.
We're going down.
Saucers! Behind that peak up ahead there!
What's wrong?
Number two car is disabled.
Cut your power.
We'll have to pick them up.
Hurry! Come on, come on.
Get them in, quickly!
Come on, come on.
- Come on, hurry. Hurry!
- Wait for me!
- Come on, hurry!
- All here, sir.
- You fought well, Kogure.
- Thank you, sir.
Back to the ships.
Quickly!
Can you contact either ship?
No one answers.
Look.
They've been here.
I wonder why they didn't wreck the other one.
Maybe they were driven off.
Doctor, what do you think could have become of Iwomura?
I don't know, but I doubt if he's alive.
You men investigate the ship.
- Yes.
- Prepare the elevator to hoist the car.
- But above all, be careful.
- Yes, sir.
Here they come! Get inside, quick!
Kogure! Take cover, run!
Look!
It's Iwomura! Over there.
It's Iwomura.
Iwomura!
Katsumiya! I blew up the ship.
Forgive me. They had me in their power. But now I'm free.
Now I'll stay here and hold them back...
-...while you, go on, blast off!
- Iwomura!
Goodbye, all of you. Good luck!
Goodbye, Katsumiya!
Etsuko, goodbye!
I wish you happiness. Goodbye, doctor and all my friends.
Good luck to all of you.
It's so sad.
Iwomura had to die...
...to help us get away.
No. We can never bring him back...
...but now we can fight.
An explosion accompanied the return of the surviving spaceship to Earth.
An explosion accompanied the return of the surviving spaceship to Earth.
An explosion that was to rock the course of humanity...
...and change the entire Earth into a fighting organism...
...with but one single point of view.
All over the world, people of all nations flocked together...
...to seek safety in a common union.
They insisted that their leaders should all work together...
...against this common enemy...
...and for the defense of the Earth.
From country to country the cry was taken up.
And it echoed across the surface of the Earth...
...until it was heard in the halls of the Untied Nations.
We must check...
...by every means at our disposal...
...the barbarous ambitions of the Natal spacemen.
They are bound to fall upon us with renewed attack...
...after reinforcing their base.
Doctor, can you estimate...
...how big a lead they have over us in their space technique?
Well, theirs is quite advanced when compared to ours. At least from...
...the time viewpoint.
While their theoretical knowledge may not be very far ahead of ours...
...it is clear that we should be ready to resist their attack...
...in the best way we can. I suggest that the small scouting craft...
...we now have undergoing trials...
...should be converted into fighter ships...
...to intercept the attacking saucers outside our atmosphere.
Gentlemen, we are at war with the planet Natal.
I am sure each and every one of us agrees...
...that diplomatic procedures can be bypassed in the present emergency.
And we should mobilize.
An emergency order for the construction of fighter rockets...
...was issued to all advance factories throughout the world.
Day and night, men and machines struggled...
...to complete production schedules in time.
The fate of the world hung in the balance.
On the cold Siberian plains, fighter-rocket bases...
...mushroomed into growth...
...to be followed quickly by similar launching sites...
...on the plains of Texas and at the Science Center base in Japan.
Unidentified object approaching from fourth sector, range, 8000 miles.
That would put them about here.
Stay with them, on red alert.
Yes, sir. Red alert.
- Check on Siberia.
- Siberia here.
- And Texas, is it ready?
- Ready in Texas.
Ready in Tokyo?
This is Space Control calling Russia, over.
Immerman speaking. My first fighter squadron is now taking off.
We've done our best, professor.
There really isn't much more to say.
It better work the first time. We won't be able to send anyone else out.
That's so.
Rocket one to Space Control.
Rocket one calling
Space Control.
Space Control to rocket one, come in please, over.
Cruising in E sector.
Objects approaching on course.
Looks like it might be the enemy.
We're moving in to investigate.
It's a large force of enemy saucers.
They're escorting a mother ship with space torpedoes.
- We are going in after them.
- An all-out offensive.
Attention, emergency.
Enemy forces are approaching.
All defense units report to E sector to repel invaders.
- Four, three...
- Prepare to launch.
Fire!
This is group B.
Altitude, 4000 kilometers.
We'll rendezvous in 30 seconds.
This is the captain of the reinforcement group.
Altitude, 5000 kilometers.
I have the enemy in sight and am preparing to attack. That is all.
Get them.
They've fired a space torpedo at Earth.
This is group leader A.
Space torpedoes approaching Earth.
You must leave your sector and go after them and destroy the torpedoes.
Right.
The mother ship has gotten through, escorted by six saucers.
Get them.
They're in the second sector...
...on a gradual approach.
We will track.
- Don't let them get away.
- We will hold them, sir.
One saucer is approaching Earth behind several space torpedoes.
Mother ship is approaching
Tokyo with escort.
Mother ship is approaching
Tokyo with escort.
Mother ship is approaching
Tokyo with escort.
Group A reporting.
We have destroyed the bulk of the enemy fleet with two exceptions:
The mother ship and one saucer.
Keep out of the way, then.
We'll take over now.
Enemy coordinates are 30 degrees north of the space terminal...
...and seven miles high.
Ray gun ready?
Stand by!
- Fire!
- Fire!
This is group A reporting.
We are very low on fuel, and we must return to base.
It's up to you now.
The enemy saucer and mother ship are nearing your position.
Well done, group A.
Katsumiya.
- Prepare to fire!
- Ready!
Contact.
- Ready, two?
- Two, ready.
Fire.
- Beat them all.
- Very good!
Here is a report from Space
Radar Search, commander.
No indication of further enemy activity.
Dr. Adachi, we did it.
Congratulations!
Grandpa!
- Well done, major.
- Commander, here's the colonel's son.
Come on, now.
Listen, Papa, how many enemy saucers were there?
Well, you can read all about it in the paper.
- Well, goodbye, commander.
- Goodbye, and have a nice trip.
You can terminate the alert.
Yes, sir, I will give the order.
All stations, the alert is over.
Conditions green.
We're free! We're safe!
We're free! We're safe!
Katsumiya, I'd like you to come along with me.
- I'm going to talk to the rocket pilots.
- Right, sir.
Let's go.
[Thunder cracks]
[Wind howling]
[Lawrence] I don't know if she's still alive or not.
They've had her now for the past 24 hours.
I'm equally uncertain as to the fate of her father,
Professor Elliot.
Both are probably dead.
The odds are 100 to one
I, too, will be finished before another sun rises, but tonight I'm going to try to fight for my life and those larger issues, so perilously at stake, affecting all mankind.
If I fail...
This seems most likely...
The consequences to humanity defy the imagination.
As the only trained reporter who has been in a position to observe the terror from its inception, and as one of the few living humans who has actually met, face to face, the man from planet x.
I will try to set down the strangest story a newspaper man ever covered.
It began prosaically enough in a college observatory not far from Los Angeles what is it?
A new planet.
For want of another name, presently identified as planet x.
It was first spotted some weeks ago rushing out of space.
Is this the reason
Professor Elliot wired me to contact you?
Have you known the Professor long?
Yeah. I was with the eighth air force in england.
The Professor was our chief meteorologist doping out weather for bomber raids.
The British lent him to us.
Good man,
Elliot.
Oh, the best.
He and I became fast friends.
He always said if he ever ran across anything of real importance, he'd give me a crack at it.
Used to think he was kidding, but I guess not.
No, I guess not.
[Lawrence]
What's it all about, doctor?
[Dr. blaine]
The world, Mr. Lawrence, is now experiencing strange astronomical phenomena.
Reports have come in from all over the globe of objects being sighted in the sky.
[Bell rings]
You're not saying a scientist like yourself believes such nonsense.
No. I'm not telling you that.
Then on what evidence do you base your statement?
On questionable reports of trained observers.
First this phenomenon seemed to have no particular focal point, appeared at random here and there about the world.
But about
6 weeks ago, tremendous concentration was detected over a certain section of the earth, in a particularly barren and isolated area.
Burry?
Yes. What do you know about it?
Well, nothing much, except that this cablegram
I got from Professor elliotcame from there.
Says, uh, "if you remember my promise"
"for exclusive story, see Dr. Robert Blaine
"at university observatory."
Signed Elliot.
Strange waves resembling, but still not radar waves, have been bouncing off the earth.
Coming from someplace outside, like the moon or
Mars for instance?
Originating on some sphere outside, but not the moon or Mars or any known planet.
Well, where's this planet x fit in?
What's it rushing##towards?
The earth.
You mean you mean it's likely to collide with us?
No. At least not a headlong collision.
Oh, we've had these things before, like halley's comet for instance, to name one.
None which has come as close to our world as this one is expected to in the next 3 weeks, if our calculations are correct.
You think something will happen?
I wish I knew exactly.
At the best, atmospheric disturbances, hurricanes, probably tidal waves.
And at the worst?
Where does Professor
Elliot fit in?
He discovered the planet.
Oh, is that why he's in burry?
If he's correct in his deductions, this isolated island is that part of the world the new planet will come closest to.
Gee, it sort of makes cold fingers run down my spine.
How about you?
This is not visible to the naked eye.
Not yet.
How do I get to burry?
[British accent]
Here you are, sir.
This is burry.
Uh, do you know
Professor Elliot?
Aye. I've seen him once or twice.
Where's he staying, do you know?
Up at the Brock.
Good evening to you, sir.
Well... hey, wait a minute!
Mr. Lawrence.
Hello.
I'm sorry I was late.
Had a little motor trouble.
Well, better late than never.
Put your things in the back.
All right.
Thanks.
All set?
Yeah. Drive on, macduff.
Fog's getting thicker.
It's always worse on the moors than it is in the village.
You don't remember me, do you?
Well, I, uh...
Isn't that a fine example of how unfaithful men are?
The last time I saw you,
I got your solemn promise that when I grew up
I could be your girl.
Good heavens.
Enid Elliot.
Well,
I thought...
Took you long enough to recognize me.
The last time I saw you you were crying because you had to go back to school.
All gawky legs and buck teeth.
I see you do remember me.
Braces took care of the teeth.
And nature took care of the legs.
I hadn't thought you'd noticed.
It's the newspaper man in me.
What a difference
6 years make.
I don't think you've changed.
Well, thank you kindly, or should I thank you kindly?
Yeah.
Thanks.
Hey what did all this?
Bombs?
Father time.
It's been this way for centuries.
Who ever built this tower up here at the end of nowhere?
[Enid] They call these towers brocks.
Originally built, local legend has it, as a defense against the viking raiders.
Well, come on.
"As of midnight, the 13th of September,
1950, isas follows..." hello.
Professor.
John.
Good to see you.
And you, my lad, and you.
It's a cozy place you have here.
Serves its purpose.
Oh you remember
Dr. mears by any chance?
Mr. Lawrence has forgotten.
I forgive him.
I doubt if he ever expected to see my face again.
Frankly, I hadn't given it much thought.
John and I are starved.
You and Dr. mears have already eaten.
Yes. We had a bite.
Take him down to the kitchen, and fix yourselves something.
It's just a tiny place right here, but home is where the pantry is.
Isn't that so?
That's right.
Come along.
Here. Let us continue.
"1950, is as follows..."
What I lack in talent for cookery,
I make up in speed.
But I really do brew a fine cup of tea.
Well,
I hope so.
How many of these rooms are there?
This one's mine, and there's another one under this.
Dr. mears occupies it.
No thanks.
You have some.
Um-hmm.
Hey, how on earth does he happen to be here?
Oh, you know father, soft-hearted as a sponge.
Mears dropped in on us, 2 weeks ago, pleaded he was ill and broke, and jolly well looked it, too.
And he was one of father's students...
So he's here.
Hmm. Just dropped in?
Um-hmm.
People don't just drop in here, a place on the edge of the world.
I heard he was somewhere in Scotland.
He's been in seclusion since that trouble he got into.
I feel sort of sorry for him.
Well, you needn't.
He should've gotten 20 years.
[Enid] He did go to prison for a while, didn't he?
I was just a kid then.
I trust I'm not disturbing you,
Mr. Lawrence.
Professor Elliot would like to see you upstairs.
Go ahead, John.
I'll be up in a minute, soon as I put away these dishes.
All right.
Didn't interrupt you before you'd finished, did I?
No. No. Just having some tea.
Where's mears?
What? I thought he was behind me.
Hmm. Must have gone to his room.
I called you to take a look at our mysterious visitor before we lose her for the night.
Good.
Fog's rolling in off the moors.
Go ahead, John.
Thank you.
[Lawrence]
It's tripled in size.
[Dr. elliot]
Grows larger nightly.
Well?
What do you think,
Professor?
I think
I'll just have to wait and see on the 17th.
[Dog howls]
Stray dog.
[Laughs nervously]
Eerie place, these moors.
Wet, too.
Yet they have a grim beauty of their own.
That hot tea you drank should've warmed you.
Is that why the
British drink it...
The climate?
And because we like it.
Hello, lightning.
Storm brewing.
I've heard that one may tell how far a storm is by the number of seconds between the lightning and the thunder. True?
Well, let's see.
Huh. Must be in Chicago.
No thunder.
Hmm.
Well, static electricity maybe.
This time of year?
How's the view from the top of the rise?
Pretty if there's anything to be seen.
Well, I'm sure of that.
The village is over there, but the fog's too thick.
You'll have to take my word for the view.
I'll do that and add 3 of my own.
I like it.
We better be getting back. Dad'll worry.
I'll bet right now he doesn't know we're alive.
And it's getting cold.
I hadn't noticed.
Well, which way?
Uh, this.
I think it's closer this way.
Here we are.
Take it easy.
Thank you.
Ooh. I'm sorry.
[Enid] What on earth is that?
[Lawrence]
I don't know.
If I were mechanically minded,
I could probably tell you.
Well, what could it be?
That, as we say back in the states, is the $64 question.
Oh, careful. It might explode or something.
Oh, it's not a bomb.
At least, I don't think it is.
Besides, what would a bomb be doing up here?
Fell out of a plane?
Do any ever fly across here?
The only one that's been anywhere near here in the past 6 months must've been the one that set you off the breakwater.
Well, your father'll probably be able to tell us##what it is.
Oh, you couldn't carry that back to the Brock. It looks...
Nothing to it.
Ah.
The measurements are singularly precise.
Well, what is it?
How does it operate?
If it does or has.
Well, you ask more than
I'm prepared to answer.
A theory might suggest that the inside is hollow, and it might've contained a propulsive element of some kind, a gas perhaps.
Look here.
The metal is discolored, possibly from the generation of some terrific heat.
It's fantastic.
Professor, look.
Interesting.
That should work out at about
1/5 the specific gravity of steel.
That could mean millions, millions if that formula could be reproduced.
I don't know if I follow you.
What do you mean, if that formula could be produced?
Where do you think this came from?
Well, my idea may sound fantastic, may be fantastic for all I can say, but this object...
Comes out of space?
I could not deny the possibility.
Do you realize what this metal could mean?
It's harder than steel.
It has tremendous tensile strength.
And it weighs only
1/5 as much as steel.
The man who controls this formula, controls the industry of the world.
Before you start spending those millions, doctor, consider a slight problem.
What's that?
If the Professor's theory bears any fact you're going to have a little difficulty mining that metal, don't you think?
I was speaking metaphorically, of course.
You reassure me.
Let us concentrate on this remarkable object.
Father, it's quite late.
Shh. The scale is delicate and responds to a breath upon it.
[Yawns]
How long has it been since you slept?
Oh, about 36 hours and
6,000 Miles ago, I guess.
Would you object to sharing a bed with Dr. mears?
No need to inflict myself on him.
Just for tonight.
I noticed an inn at the village.
Tomorrow I'll make dad get rid of mears.
Not on my account.
On my own. He...
Well, he upsets me.
Well, we can't have you getting upset.
Can we?
Where you going?
I'll drive you.
Oh.
See you tomorrow.
Well, good night.
Thanks a lot for everything.
Drive carefully.
Oh, I know every stone in the road.
John?
Yeah?
It's nice having you here.
Thanks.
Good night.
Good night.
[Tire blows]
Confound the luck.
[Sighs]
[Electronic pulsating hum]
Aah!
[Running footsteps]
[Tap, tap, tap]
The light flickered on and off.
It wasn't very bright, a ghastly greenish color.
When I got close to it, it looked like a giant glass ball girdled with something like a steel belt.
3 of them,
I think.
When I got close enough to look in, there it was.
"It?" What?
That face right on the other side of the glass, looking right into mine. I was scared.
Face, a human face?
A ghastly caricature, like something distorted by pressure.
I can't think how else to describe it.
A horrible, grotesque imitation of a face looking right into my eyes.
Now, I know you're not given to hysteria, my dear, but your statements have the tinge of fantasy.
Now, you you say you saw this...
This hideous face.
Yes!
And I ran, really frightened,
I guess, for the first time in my life.
Hmm.
You're not going##out there.
I'd better take a look.
You have a hot drink and get some sleep.
I'll show you.
My dear...
Don't argue.
I'm quite all right.
It was just the first shock.
Now you've got me wondering just what I did see.
I'm going with you.
[Elliot]
All right.
[Enid]
This way.
[Elliot]
Where?
Over the next rise.
[Dog howls]
I don't see anything.
I think it's straight ahead.
[Wind howls]
Look.
Quietly now.
[Electronic hum]
[Elliot]
Can't see much.
No face, at least.
I'm certain of that.
What is it?
Obviously a creation of science.
That's beyond question.
But manufactured by whom and for what purpose?
Careful.
[Hum stops]
Shh. Shh.
Look, the light went out.
[Footsteps from inside]
[Piercing tone]
Down.
[Tone stops]
Let's get away from here.
We should've waited until daylight.
It was senseless coming out here in the dark.
I'm... it's uncanny.
Come on, father.
Get up, father.
Is anything the matter?
Father, do you hear me?
Hurry.
Come on.
Hurry.
[Frogs croaking]
Please wait.
Father, stop!
Father?
Don't stare at me.
Come with me.
Slowly.
[Buzzing]
All I was capable of was obedience when I heard a command.
It was a complete paralysis of the faculties other than blind, slavish movement.
Well, we seem to be confronted by a concrete menace.
Willful.
Hostile.
Do you think...
Could it possibly have something to do with that planet?
Oh, am I glad to see you.
I saw your car.
Is anything the matter?
We've had a case of the jitters.
But I shouldn't keep you out here on the doorstep.
Come on in.
Your theory,
Professor, is that these occurrences are in some way connected with planet x.
Have you a better theory to offer?
No, but, uh, you'll have to pardon me if it takes me a moment to get my bearings.
What do you think this is building up to?
Well, I must confess
I'm beyond my depth.
We have but one theory to work on.
In approximately
60 hours the planet's orbit will bring it into its closest position to this world, burry will be the nearest spot on earth to the planet and whatever and whoever is upon it.
60 hours.
Don't you think we'd better notify the police?
What should we notify them of?
That ball out there.
The gadget enid and I found.
And defeat everything that we've spent all these weeks in this forsaken spot to achieve? Being overrun with the curious?
Somebody's liable to run onto that thing out there.
Oh, it isn't likely.
This area of the moors is checkered with marshes.
Many a straying farm animal has been swallowed up.
This place has a bad name.
The natives keep their distance.
Where's this ball now?
I'll take you.
You can see it from the edge of this rock.
Look.
No sign of life.
You know what that looks like to me?
A big diving bell.
The only difference between water and space is a matter of density.
Hmm. Here.
It's pretty quiet now.
Let's go down and take a look.
[Buzzing]
That everlasting fog they mistake for climate around here.
Come on.
Glass?
I wonder.
It was my wife's.
Diamonds cut glass.
Not a scratch.
Glass and practically any other substance on earth.
This must be tremendously resistant.
I can't think of anything known to man equally so.
And this, you believe, from out of space?
What else?
What's the next step, Professor?
Keep it carefully under observation until the 17th and find out whether it has any connection with what may or may not happen then.
We'd better be getting back.
We don't want to worry enid too much.
Quite right.
[Spacesuit hissing]
That thing he's holding. Watch it.
Don't move.
If he doesn't take the idea and make a move for me, you run.
Run as hard and as fast as you can and come back with help.
Ever tried outrunning the speed of light?
Well, here goes.
This is a universal gesture.
Maybe it'll work.
[Electronic noise pulses]
What's the matter with him?
[Elliot] Hear that hissing noise?
[Lawrence] Sounds like it's coming from that tank on his back.
[Elliot] Probably filled with gas, something like oxygen.
He's trying to regulate it.
[Lawrence] He's trying to turn that knob to the right, but he doesn't have the strength or coordination.
[Hissing grows louder]
Must have decided we're friendly natives.
We've got to find some means of communication.
He's capable of sound.
[Alien noise pulses]
It's an attempt to communicate.
It seems hopeless, though.
It looks as if we're up against a blank wall.
Let's beat it back to the Brock.
What, and leave him?
Question is, will he let us?
It's maddening.
Here we have this astounding creature with his vast potential for fabulous knowledge to be given us, and we may only stand and stare at each other.
Lawrence.
Elliot.
[Alien noise pulses]
Oh, I'm getting primitive in my excitement.
It's foolish of me.
What about sign language?
Shall I try it?
Just don't alarm him.
It's no use.
Start backing up.
If he makes a move for that thing in his holster, stop.
All right.
Back up.
[Pulses]
All right now.
On the double.
[Coughs]
[Coughs]
What's the matter?
[Coughs]
Father!
I'm all right.
[Coughs]
John, where have you been? I've been so...
Behind you.
[Alien noise pulses]
[Lawrence]
Any luck?
[Elliot]
Nothing works.
He just keeps making that sound to everything we try to do.
How is enid? Did the sedative work?
Yeah, she's asleep now.
Good.
[Elliot] We've got to reach him.
You've found a means of communication, doctor?
Yes.
What?
A common denominator,
Professor.
The basic and universal language:
Geometry.
By George, doctor!
You've hit it!
If anything should warrant success, this should.
Excuse me, Professor.
You've lost me.
I'm the shadowy figure in the background with a stupid look on his face.
I don't get this math.
There may be no scientific achievement without math.
In itself, it's the purest language of science.
Now this creature represents an obviously superior race of beings where science is concerned.
To be able to land on the earth from a planet whose existence was previously unsuspected.
I'm up to you now.
If there's anything our friend should understand, and we might use as a bridge to reach him, it's this same basic language: Geometry.
Precisely.
Professor, this is not an easy formula to devise.
Would you...
I understand.
You need undisturbed concentration.
Let us know when you're ready.
Come, John.
You're leaving him alone with...
I presume your concern arises from fears for my safety, Mr. Lawrence.
Spare yourself any anxiety.
This creature is as intelligent as we.
He knows that we are trying to find a mutual basis for understanding.
I'm quite safe.
Mears is right.
Come, John.
[Pulses]
I'll have the world in my pocket with your help.
[Humming and pulsing]
Now don't start fussing about me like that, my dear.
I have a little touch of the flu.
It's nothing to get nervous about.
You're going to stay in bed.
Here's a compromise.
Suppose I go to the village to the drugstore and buy medicine that will alleviate the...
"chemist" in england.
Chemist or drugstore,
I'll get something that'll knock this out.
You stay in bed till I get back.
Oh, that creature downstairs...
Don't worry about him.
I'll take a look at him.
I don't like leaving you here with...
I'll return as fast as I can.
Here are the car keys.
If you fix the tire, it'll save you a lot of time.
All right.
Oh, and what have we here, now?
Oh, morning, constable.
Isn't that miss Elliot's car?
Yeah. I'm visiting her father.
So you're the man from America.
Yup.
Folks be saying all's not well up to the Brock.
They're absolutely right.
Strange doings at all times of the night.
Naturally.
Excuse me.
Aye.
Naturally, you're saying.
Yup. Professor Elliot has a touch of the flu.
Oh, so,
'tis true.
As a matter of fact,
I'm on my way in now to the chemist to get some medicine.
Aye.
If you'll excuse me.
Aye.
This shall be my secret.
[Hums and pulses]
Oh.
Heh heh heh heh.
To think, a fantastic gnome like you had to hurtle out of space to put this power into my hands.
Well, now that we've made contact,
I'm going to tear out every secret you've got.
[Pulses and hums loudly]
[Humming ends]
We're gonna ration this, and you're gonna start earning it.
[Enid] Dr. mears.
Dr. mears.
What is it?
Father would like to see you.
He's resting.
Were you able to communicate with him?
No.
It was a futile attempt.
I couldn't make him understand me at all.
I'm most disappointed.
I had high hopes.
Oh, I felt sure you were on the right track.
Well, we will have to try another method.
How are you feeling?
Everybody's so concerned about me.
May I trouble you for a glass of water, please?
Yes.
[Enid screams]
Got the stuff.
Should have you up around in no time.
Where's enid?
In the kitchen.
Enid.
Enid?
[Lawrence] Enid was gone.
Had I sacrificed her just for a newspaper story?
That was the thought which tormented me.
She's nowhere around.
The dungeon's empty.
Empty?
What happened after I left?
Enid! He must have taken her.
Come on.
Where to?
The sphere on the moor.
Where else would he take her?
You got a gun,
Professor?
I have one.
Well, bring it.
Be careful.
I'll go along...
Wait a minute,
Professor.
Be sensible.
You'd better stay in bed.
We'll go out and scout and be back as soon as we can.
Let's go.
The gun'sin my room.
I'll meet you out front.
What did he do to him?
He was trying to establish communication.
How? Oh, yes, I know geometrically, but how else?
What do you mean?
Did he abuse him?
Provoke him in any way?
There wouldn't have been any sense in doing so.
Well, I don't consider mears a sensible man.
He's an ambitious man, a brilliant man, a dishonest man, but not a sensible one.
But why should he be foolish as to try to jeopardize...
Well, he mayhave to answer for that one of these days. Here.
Directions are on the bottle.
You'd better take it, and stay in bed.
Anything?
Not a sign. Nothing.
We can't risk a move.
Enid might be in there.
What'd you do to him back there in the dungeon?
Do to him?
I didn't do anything.
Nothing at all.
He showed a definite disposition toward friendliness when I left.
Well, how can you talk of him as if he were a human being?
How do we know what thought processes run through his head?
How can we even assume that he thinks like we do?
How can you anticipate what a fantastic organism like that might do or might not do?
All right.
Stay here and
I'll be back.
If anything should happen to enid
I'll never forgive myself.
I should never have exposed her to this danger.
Should never have exposed her.
[Lawrence] The night was haunted by terror and the sickening conviction that the man from planet x had enid powerless in his grasp.
If she was to be saved,
I had to think calmly.
I checked off my resources.
Help from the village?
I dared not risk it with enid a captive.
The Professor?
Ill. Helpless.
Dr. mears?
Unstable. Unpredictable.
If I only were not so helpless before the voiceless threat of the unknown.
Where was enid?
And where was the man from planet x?
[Footsteps]
Good evening to you, sir.
Good heavens, men.
Don't you knock?
I thought you heard us coming upthe stairs.
No, I didn't.
I didn't mean to frighten you, sir.
What brings you here?
We'd like to speak with the Professor.
He's sick.
He's on a sedative.
What do you want with him?
'Tis a matter of considerable importance.
Sandy burns and
Mike Lane have gone.
Gone?
Where? Why?
Plain vanished and none can tell where.
I don't get you.
Gordy and me, we've been out on the moors searching for them.
We dropped by here to look in on you.
You don't think
I have your
2 villagers up here?
Each night they drive the sheep in from the moors.
Last night they did not come home.
The two of them.
And what we want to know is it any of your doing here at the Brock?
Up here?
You'll not deny there's something very strange going on here.
No, I won't deny it.
Something strange has been going on.
Boogey doings.
Aye, aye.
And now, what exactly is the natureof this...
Miss Elliot has disappeared.
Aye, miss...
Oh, no.
She has, now?
Have you any idea as to where she could be?
Yes, I have, but I can't tell you.
And why not?
You wouldn't believe me.
I'll have to show you.
Aye, show me, is it?
I'll try to explain on the way if your friend will stay with the Professor while we're gone.
Well, all right.
But there'd best be no monkey business of a foreign nature.
I'll go with you, and, gordy aye, Tammy?
If I'm not back in a reasonable time, call outthe village.
Aye.
Boogey's work.
I'll not believe such clapper-claw...
That's why I'm going to show you.
It's that sphere which brought him out of space.
It's just over the next rise.
Aye, it's daft you are completely flummoxed.
Or it is some
American joke.
Look, I don't enjoy walking out on these cold moors.
Professor Elliot hasn't been living in that Brock because he likes it, and his daughter hasn't disappeared as a joke.
Aye.
You make it sound very sober.
'Tis a sorry part of the moors for honest men to be in.
Come on, easy.
It's right ahead, now.
[Constable]
I don't see a thing.
But this is the spot where I left mears just a few hours ago.
You don't tell me he's gone away, too.
Mears?
Mears?
[Dog howls]
Give me a light.
Aye.
I don't see a thing.
There, there.
You see where the brush is flattened?
What's this?
Mears' binoculars.
Ach, man, it must be you've been sampling too much of our good scot whisky.
Finding glasses doesn't mean much.
What about your
2 villagers who've disappeared and miss Elliot and now mears?
Believe me, man, we're in trouble.
We'll go back to the station house.
I'll get out a search party.
Meanwhile I'll keep me eyes on you.
I don't care where you look, provided you do something.
Now, go along with you.
Tammy, have you found my man?
[Andre] Was out on the moor gave you any clue, constable?
Nay, not.
We have not found a thing.
But 2 more persons are missing.
One is the old
Professor's daughter, and the other is one of the men staying up to the Brock.
Now, don't you worry.
We'll find him for you.
Donald.
Aye?
Go up one side of the village.
Knock on the doors.
Andre, you go up the other side.
We'll search the moor.
It will take every man.
Tell the men to bring what arms they have.
Andre, Donald, you hear that?
Get on with you, then.
Gordy! What ails you, man?
Act like you've seen a ghost or something.
A ghost? No.
Something of flesh and blood yet of neither.
Horrible, monstrous creature with a head as big as two men put together, and skin with the shine of a new shilling, and eyes that are no better than a dead fish.
Where'd you see him?
Why'd you leave the Professor?
I didn't.
He left me.
What are you saying?
I went to fill the water jug at the well.
When I was coming back, the Professor was walking into the fog with his friend who's been with him.
Dr. mears?
That's him.
I heard him call by name.
What happened?
The Professor's ill.
The other one was helping him.
And he looked no better than a dead man himself, with his glassy eyes.
I was afraid, and I followed them.
And then, then it was I saw it.
It? It what, man?
The boogey.
Boogey?
With a big head and a hump in his back.
He stepped out of the fog a wee bit before the Professor and his friend,
I did not wait to see what else happened.
I ran until I thought my heart would burst from my chest.
All right. Get back, now, get back.
Well, Mr. Lawrence what do you make of that?
It's that creature from outer space.
He's got mears in his clutches and used him to get the Professor too.
That's where you'll find the men from the village, too.
[Andre] Man from space?
What clapper-claw is this?
'Tis a fearsome visitor from another world.
Is it complete daft you are, constable?
'Tis why the Professor has been living up at the Brock.
To see what would happen when an unknown planet came close to the earth on the night of the 17th.
That's a few days from now.
But why here in burry?
The Professor's calculations told him this is the area of closest contact with the planet.
[Woman]
But the boogey
'tis real, then?
We have every reason to believe it is.
The Lasses and the children stay behind locked doors!
You men!
It will be all over town in no time.
We've got to get out on the moors.
You could not get a loon out there.
We'll get help from the outside.
Got a radio?
I mean a wireless?
Not for outside contact.
Call London, tell them what's happened here, and ask for help at once.
Hello?
Are you there?
Hello!
Hello, there!
It's dead.
Here, let me try.
Hello, operator?
Operator.
Hello, hello.
Have you had this trouble before?
Only during climate disturbances.
There's no local exchange here?
It's over on the mainland.
The wire goes across the bottom of the sea.
Well, except for the fog, the weather isn't too bad.
Aye, I can't understand it.
Lend me your bicycle and I'll go to the Brock.
Maybe I'll find something that...
Who knows?
Fine risk you'd be running.
It's better than hanging around here, just waiting.
The bicycle's outside.
Thanks.
I'll be back in a few hours.
You hang on that phone.
Aye.
Hello?
These two must have undergone the same treatment.
You mean they were acting independent of their own will?
They were acting like slaves, and seeking villagers to be enslaved with them.
But for what?
Can't you see?
He's building an army.
If he isn't stopped, he'll have every man in this village to carry out his orders.
You take the taste of the tea right out of my mouth.
Any luck with the phone?
Nothing but jangling clanging and buzzing.
Is there a way we can get word off this island?
No, no, no. Except what? What?
Well, talk, man!
I was thinking perhaps heliograph.
Well, try it at once!
But there's not enough sunlight to get to the nearest place.
[Ship whistle blows]
There's enough to reach that boat out there.
Hey, right you are!
Fast, fast, before it sails by.
Right-o.
She'll be nosing into that fog bank in a few minutes.
Aye.
[Whistle blows]
Emergency.
Village terror-stricken.
Contact Scotland yard.
Well, she's gone.
Aye.
Fog bank swallowed her up.
Think they saw us?
I cannot tell.
And what are you lads doing out this time of...
Oh, look here, lads!
Let me go! This is no time for pranks!
[Continues shouting]
And I found it at the new location, where he'd moved it.
It was being fortified, and I have no doubt that the men doing the job were the same ones who disappeared from the village but I was too far away to recognize them.
And I have some news for you, too.
Two more of the men of the village have been taken.
How'd that happen?
Young wilke and Bobby Harris.
Young wilke went down to look at his cows.
They hadn't been milked for 2 days.
His sister said he left a little before sunrise.
He didn't return.
Bobby went down to look at his boat, to see if it were up above the midnight tide line.
He didn't return, neither.
If the men left don't buckle down, this will be a village of zombies.
You can not get them out.
It's the fear of the unknown that scared them.
Even if they would take the risk, their Lasses wouldn't let them.
What should we do?
Stand around and let him send for us?
[Knock on door]
Come.
Come in.
Gentlemen.
Who are you?
Are you in charge of this station, constable?
Aye.
I'm inspector Porter.
This is sergeant Ferris.
Scotland yard?
Yes.
Gentlemen, pardon me.
Come in, inspector come in. Sit down.
We were in Edinburgh.
We received word from London...
Our message got through!
The ship saw us!
Aye.
I understand a freight ship relayed to London by a wireless a message he picked up while passing that was flashed by heliograph.
I'm John Lawrence.
Oh. American?
Newspaperman.
Affiliated press.
How'd you get here?
Small plane.
Landed South of the village.
Only field without boulders.
Took us an hour to trudge here.
You're a long way from home, Mr. Lawrence.
What are you doing here in burry?
Sit down, inspector.
I'll try to tell you.
How do you expect to cope with this situation, inspector?
Well, from what
I've been told,
I see only one way.
A detachment of the military.
That creature won't be taken.
He'll fight and all those people he's captured will die with him.
How will you get soldiers here?
The telephone's out.
Our plane has a wireless.
There just might be another way.
Oh? What's that?
It's now 9:30.
I'll give you until 11:00 to try what you can.
If you're not back by then, we'll open fire.
But you've got to at least give us time.
By that time, your job must be finished.
If it isn't
Everyone out there might be annihilated...
Enid, the Professor, people from the village,
Dr. mears...
Everyone.
Professor Elliot told you that planet would be within the earth's gravitational orbit by midnight.
The result of such an unique proximity could be...
Anything.
None of us know what that enigma out on the moors might be planning.
Aye, you're right, inspector.
The Professor's theory was invasion.
We can't risk determining whether it has an effect.
A planet of such size coming so close to ours might cause a disastrous atmospheric upheaval.
Therefore,
Mr. Lawrence, 11:00.
We dare not delay beyond that time.
Do you understand?
Yeah.
We may be risking too much.
All right.
The hour is near, and the man from planet x is waiting.
Be sure who's coming out of the fog before you start blasting, inspector.
I'll make certain.
I've written a story of what's happened here up to this minute.
Can I count on you to get it to the right hands when security seems fit?
I'll see that it reaches the proper hands.
Thanks.
Well...
Good luck.
Look out for yourself.
Yeah, thanks.
[Buzzing sound]
Professor Elliot.
Professor Elliot, this is John.
John Lawrence.
Do you hear me?
[Emotionless]
I hear you.
Where's enid?
Where's enid?
Inside.
What did mears tell you when he came back to the Brock?
Told me enid had escaped and sent for me.
Listen to me,
Professor.
Climb over this embankment...
Very quietly...
And walk straight ahead.
Climb over this embankment.
Walk straight ahead.
Mears.
Dr. mears.
Come here.
Kneel down.
You were able to communicate with thecreature, right?
Yes.
You found out how to do it in the dungeon at the Brock.
Is that so?
Yes.
What's he doing now?
What's his appearance here mean?
He's establishing a wireless directional beam to his planet.
At midnight, when the planet is at its closest approach to earth, an invasion will be launched.
But why? Why?
He comes from a planet that's dying.
It's turning to ice.
If his people do not escape from the planet before it swings back along its route through space, they will be doomed.
How'd they get so close to earth?
They managed to make the planet deviate from its natural orbit by scientific degravitation.
What was that object enid and I found on the moors?
It was a magnetically powered range finder, used to determine the composition of the earth's atmosphere.
It was sent out in advance of the spaceship for experimental purposes.
And how does he keep you a slave to his will?
By exposing us to a ray.
He exposes us to it every few hours.
Wait here.
Men.
Stop work.
Walk straight ahead.
Walk.
[High-pitched humming]
Enid! Enid!
Come out of there.
Mears, stand up.
Up!
Run!
Over this wall.
Come down.
Darling, it's me.
John.
Come on, we must hurry.
There's something out there.
It's the Professor!
Ah, it's glad I am to see you, sir.
Glad I am, indeed.
Where are you going?
Stop now.
Ferris, help him sit down.
Come along,
Professor.
Come along.
That's it, man.
Sit down here.
That's right,
Professor.
[Explosion]
[John]
Keep going!
No, they can't destroy him.
They mustn't.
[Explosion]
Mears!
Come back!
[Man] Fire!
Fools.
The planet!
You're going back with inspector Porter in his plane, hmm?
Yep. By this time tomorrow afternoon, we'll be...
Far out over the ocean.
Going home.
Mm-hmm.
I'll miss you.
Your father tells me you're coming to California so he can confer with Dr. blane.
Mm-hmm.
Soon.
Good.
Is it true that no one will ever know what happened here?
Knowledge would only bring more fear, in a world already filled with it.
Can such a thing be kept a secret?
No, but it can be reduced to gossip.
You know,
I think that creature was friendly.
I wonder what would have happened if Dr. mears hadn't frightened him?
Who knows?
Perhaps the greatest curse to ever befall the world, or perhaps the greatest blessing.
Ladies and gentlemen, it's amazing how much we know about the surface of our globe.
In the last 100 years, men have progressively studied this.
Explorations have reached the North, the South Pole.
There are really relatively only a few square miles left of the surface of our globe that are not known.
During the same years, men have reached out into the stars, three times further in your lifetime and mine, three times further into space than men have ever been able to go before.
Amazing knowledge we have of that and of this.
What's inside this globe?
What is there beneath our feet as we stand on the earth?
No one knows, of course.
And science ponders about it and all men are curious, but no one knows.
Primitive man, going into caves, reaching back and back, and down and down, wondered what lay beyond, and in terror he fled out.
And he remembered strange sighs and noises.
Now you go back to Mesopotamia and the beginning of Western civilization, and you have the great hero
Gilgamesh going down into the underworld.
And so, too, with the Greeks.
All down through time.
Religions of the past have postulated the existence of this inner habitable world.
All through the Middle Ages, people believed of something under the surface.
Dante, the great Dante, saw great cone-like cavities stretching down to the very center of the earth.
There's nothing new about this. lt's as old as man, this belief that under the surface there may be areas inhabitable by man.
And in our time and in the last 100 years, there've been a number of theories, very curious and strange theories, about what goes on in the center of our planet.
This is a very famous and interesting and odd one.
A soldier...
Rather, a minor hero of the War of 1812 was a man named
John Cleeves Symmes.
And he had a sudden idea that inside our world, like onion layers, there were globes within globes, five of them, some of them inhabited, and that if you were to travel up through the icy wastes of our world, the northwest edge of Siberia, you could go down through a hole, and go successively to these various spheres.
Unfortunately, he was thoroughly obsessed with this, went around lecturing, and in fatigue, died before he could make this experiment.
Now, here's another theory much closer to us.
This is 1870, about.
A young American physician named Cyrus Reed Teed had a revelation.
We are not living on the outside of the globe, said Teed, but on the inside, that when we think we're looking out at the sun, we're really looking in at the sun.
Strange, strange.
Questing mind of man that tries to find answers to things that he can't understand.
This was a theory by Karl Neupert, in Germany, in the 1920s.
He, again, imagined that we're living on the inside, rather than the outside of the globe.
And here's a real sun, and a real moon, and then a rather shadowy and formless mass of electric potentiality with little bright sparks in it.
And they give us the sense of our stars.
So in this picture you're about to see, you'll see the culmination of a long series of such desires to look into the earth.
One might well believe, philosophically, that some ancient culture, engulfed by a great and tremendous upheaval of nature might linger on in some pocket of earth.
This is science fiction, of course. lt's a fiction. lt's a fable beyond fiction, for l think if you'll study this picture and think about it, when it's over, you'll realize that this is something more than just a story told. lt's a fable with a meaning and a significance for you and for me in the 20th century.
Thank you and goodbye.
Dr. Bentley! Dr. Stuart!
Come quickly.
Bellamin! Lafarge!
Come on!
Some sort of stone tablet.
What's it doing in this strata?
The cuneiform writing...
But it is not possible in this part.
You mean it's not probable, Lafarge.
In archeology, all things are possible.
The fact is we found it below the Great Flood level, so it must be at least
5,000 years old, which would make it one of the oldest human records.
What about the inscription?
Sumerian.
It's the dedication of a temple or a public building.
Stuart, every time i think of how many civilizations have crumbled, fallen apart, rotted from the inside, or cracked from the outside, i shudder when i pick up the front page of a newspaper.
The translation, Bentley.
Sure.
The first part reads,
"i, Sharu, king of kings,
"son of Sharu Ad..."
It breaks off there.
Sharu?
Well, that's a new one on me.
Mean anything to you, Lafarge?
Dr. Bentley, do you remember the Gilgamesh tablets George Smith found?
Yeah. They told a legend about a dynasty that suddenly disappeared from the face of the earth.
Right. lt also referred to a king of the dynasty, one called Sharu or Charul.
Well, what does the rest of it say?
"He who with malice destroys, effaces, or removes from its place this, my signed attestation, may he be denounced by lshtar."
"May his name, his seed in the land,
"be destroyed."
Earthquake!
We'll have to open new trenches tomorrow along the north line, Jud.
Most of the old ones caved in.
That earthquake put us behind at least a month.
You know, Bellamin, we shouldn't complain about the work.
I think we were fortunate.
The epicenter of the earthquake was only 25 miles from here.
Do you think the goddess of Ishtar is punishing us for removing the tablets,
Lafarge?
The inscription said
"He who removes it with malice."
But we aren't malicious, are we?
We want to rescue the Sharu dynasty from oblivion.
That's what archaeologists are for, no?
Archaeologists are underpaid publicity agents for deceased royalty.
This shepherd boy found something.
What, another one?
This boy came a long way,
Dr. Bellamin.
You buys your ticket and you takes your chance.
I believe in grabbing for the gold ring every time.
Hey! Where'd you find this?
Kuhitara. High, high.
Kuhitara, the epicenter of the earthquake. lt's a kind of moss that is native to this region.
It grows only on the rocks of Kuhitara, but not where the boy found it.
Much, much higher.
The earthquake must've dislodged it and rolled it down to the plateau.
But how did it get up on Kuhitara to begin with?
Maybe Bentley has the answer.
How's it coming, Roger? lt's an oil lamp all right, shaped like a boat.
The engraved figures are of a man, a woman and different animals in pairs.
The Sumerian version of Noah's Ark?
Exactly.
The Flood's been proven to be a historical fact.
Why not a Sumerian version?
According to the inscription they got wet, too. Listen.
"I, Sharu, king of kings, son of Sharu Ad."
"From water i emerged.
I caused to embark within the vessel
"all my family, my relations,
"my craftsmen and my slaves, and the beasts of the field,
"and made my home in the ark.
We floated on the waves
"until we found the land of the snow near the goddess of Ishtar."
The top of the mountain.
The Sharu dynasty was saved from the Flood on Kuhitara.
But was never heard of again.
Of course not. No one would look for human beings on top of Kuhitara.
We're going to.
Oh, it's impossible.
The summit is less than
20,000 feet.
It's treacherous. Always wind and snow.
Nothing's there, nothing.
Then we shouldn't be afraid of nothing.
Gentlemen, Kuhitara is a treacherous mountain to climb.
Do you think we can make it? l think so.
We shall establish three camps.
The porters will carry enough supplies to establish a base camp here at the foot of the snow level.
We will then climb to here, which is 2,000 feet from the plateau on Kuhitara, and establish a second camp.
The next day we shall attempt the final climb.
All this risk and money because of a vague poetic inscription on an ancient oil lamp.
Don't you trust poets, old man?
No, l don't.
Schliemann did.
He found the ruins of Troy by trusting Homer, the biggest blabbermouth of all.
When can we start, Nazar?
My men are ready, sir.
Tomorrow morning, then.
Kuhitara.
BELLAMlN: That's a lot of mountain.
We're only going to the plateau. ls that it on the right face, Nazar?
No, Dr. Stuart.
Tomorrow we may be able to see it, if we keep to our schedule.
Then let's keep to the schedule.
We'll make camp here.
Peaceful-looking, isn't she?
The thing that impresses me the most is the complete and utter silence.
You can almost hear it.
Don't let her fool you, Mr. Bentley.
When she wants to, she can scream so loud as to make you deaf.
And you will hear her and quite soon. l think perhaps even tonight.
Tremendous invention, gasoline.
Yeah, l'm well-done in front and my back teeth are chattering.
Cheer up, Jud. lf this storm clears, we'll be on the plateau of Kuhitara by tomorrow night.
Tomorrow night is 24 hours and 3,000 feet of thin air away.
Avalanche.
This mountain's hundreds of square miles in area.
You're only occupying one square foot.
Sitting here is a lot safer than crossing Times Square.
There's an avalanche. Come on!
Well, the goddess of Ishtar isn't smiling so sweetly this morning.
Look!
The avalanche must've brought it down from the plateau.
Can anyone be living up there now?
In this thin air, it's possible to imagine anything.
The ruins of a Sumerian temple.
I don't understand.
They usually built their cities near their temples.
Where are the rest of the buildings?
Five thousand years is a long time.
To make any sense out of all this is going to take a while.
I think we ought to send Nazar back for his men and set up permanent camp here.
Dr. Bentley,
Bellamin, take a look at this.
The goddess of lshtar?
Right.
How did the inscription on the oil lamp go?
"We floated on the waves till we found the land of the snow,
"near the goddess of lshtar."
Wait till Stuart sees this.
Paul!
Paul! l can't see the bottom.
We got to get down.
Get your ropes, Nazar. lt's getting warm.
Yeah.
We must've come down at least 200 feet.
You gonna be all right?
Oh, sure. l'm fine. l found him!
We are trapped here.
Say, this isn't a natural cavern. lt's been excavated.
You all right?
We are trapped here.
No food, no water.
There seems to be a draft.
There must be another opening.
Come on, let's look for it.
There's another tunnel.
You better take a look at Lafarge.
What's wrong? lt's the air. lt's hard to breathe.
Give me a hand with him, Jud.
There's light.
What do you make of the light?
Probably some chemical in the rocks.
There must be some rational scientific explanation for this.
Look!
It's an exact duplicate of the head we found on the plateau.
Here, gentlemen, is your city. lt's fabulous.
The city must have been built on a thick crust of earth, over a volcanic bubble strong enough to support the city until an earthquake came along.
What we found on the plateau were the suburbs.
You're right.
Look here.
"The temple of Ishtar have i built with the stones of the mountain.
"Sharu."
That's how the
Sharu dynasty ended.
They ran away from a flood right into an earthquake.
The children of Noah survived and the children of Ishtar died.
There's going to be some history rewritten when we get out of here.
How do you know there's a way out?
There has to be.
We'll keep looking.
How long can we keep looking?
We've been on our feet now over 15 hours.
Yeah. We got to get some rest.
Well, this is as good a place as any.
I think i'll sleep forever.
How is it?
It's as if the whole mountain were lying on my chest.
We're going to get out of here. Don't worry.
Now get some sleep.
What was that?
I didn't hear anything.
Is there anything alive in here?
Oh, nothing dangerous.
Dwarf lizards, small bats, things like that.
Go on to sleep.
What were they?
I couldn't see a thing.
I couldn't either.
Jud, come here.
Take a look at this.
Claw marks, or maybe a hand. There are four cuts.
Some hand.
And whoever it was needs a manicure.
It can't be.
It can't be.
Save your battery,
Rog. There's no way out of here.
We were brought in.
There has to be a way out.
What do you think, Jud?
I'm no anthropologist.
I wouldn't know whether they were Cro-Magnon or Neanderthal.
I don't think an anthropologist could classify this one either.
All we can say for sure is that they walk erect and they have a skull large enough to house a brain with associative areas.
And this one died as a result of a blow from a heavy, blunt instrument.
Well, that's a sign of higher civilization.
Bentley!
What is it?
Look!
Don't move.
He wants us to go with him.
No, don't.
Gentlemen, we are in 3,000 B.C.
In my hand i hold the magic eye of Ishtar.
The sacred weapon of Ishtar.
The golden rod, the secret of death.
There, O King, are the evil ones who were captured by the beasts of the dark.
Bring them here.
Who are you?
We are friends.
We are different from you, but we are your friends.
He speaks our tongue.
We come from a world where your tongue can be studied on ancient tablets.
There is no world beyond ours.
There is only heaven, where we lived a long time ago until we were expelled for our sins amidst thunder and fire.
This is the world and we are its people.
You are not of us.
There is heaven and only the gods live there.
Would you tell us that you are gods?
The greatest find of all time, and we're buried with it. ln the name of the King, l declare sentence upon you. lf you are evil spirits, you must be destroyed.
If you are mortal, as you claim, our world cannot support you.
In either case you must be destroyed.
You will die in the fire of lshtar.
Bentley!
Come on!
Bentley!
The light. Their eyes can't tolerate the light.
Help him up, Jud.
Stop! Stop! Do not run!
Guards! Do not run!
We won the first round.
Look at him.
No pigmentation.
Without sun or ultraviolet rays they turn into albinos.
The pupils are enlarged to let in the maximum amount of low-intensity light.
The optical nerve must be hypersensitive.
That's why they couldn't stand the light.
And how have they survived here?
What do they eat?
What happened to the mind, the memories of the past in the world of light?
So many questions.
So many questions.
And why is it necessary for them to kill us?
They have to kill us because we made them doubt their world is the only world, their answers the only answers.
Look out!
Lafarge, wait!
Lafarge, wait!
Wait!
We must get away from them.
We have to get out of here. lf we go back to the temple, we are lost.
All right, Lafarge, all right.
We've been going down all the time.
It's getting hotter and hotter.
The air is getting worse.
I can hardly breathe.
What was that?
I don't know.
Lafarge, you wait here.
Come on, Jud.
Listen.
Beasts! Guards! Get them!
The button's jammed!
Come on, let's go.
Come on, Lafarge! Come on!
It won't work.
Forget it. Come on!
I can't go on!
You have to!
Come on!
Lafarge, wait!
Well, at least Lafarge is at rest where he always lived, in a world of the past.
Oh, we're right back where we started.
There's bound to be a way out of here.
There's fresh air. lt has to come from somewhere.
Why don't we get back to the river and try and swim out?
Now, you know as well as i do that river runs underground for miles.
In the King's name...
Do not use the burning light.
We come to you as friends.
I wouldn't count on that.
What do you want?
Since you have shown that you possess the divine fire of Ishtar, the King is now convinced that you are holy messengers.
Are you speaking only for your King?
The King's will is law for all.
He has ordered me to assure you of his friendship and to invite you to a royal feast.
We are most grateful.
Where is the absent one?
He was called back to heaven by Ishtar.
Follow me.
And why did lshtar send you to our kingdom?
To see how you live, to learn of your needs so she can help you.
Does she not know us through our prayers?
Does she not reward us for our sacrifices?
Does she not see us with her all-pervading eyes?
We are her eyes.
Then you will see.
Our kingdom is your home.
Mushrooms?
Why not? lt's one of the few things that can grow without the sun.
Come here!
Do not interfere.
The King's will is the law.
The fire of lshtar is the law.
So be it.
You have fondness for her, have you not?
Yes.
She belongs to you.
Go.
The gods do not favor trading human beings.
Human? She is a marked one.
Are there many like her?
No.
Rarely is one born with the mark of darkness.
And the others like yourselves.
How many are there?
Twice and a half times 60.
Well, that's not very many. lt is a sacred number.
The highest number that our sacred food can nourish.
Well, what do you do when your population exceeds that number?
We kill them.
We sacrifice them in the fire of lshtar, the like of which you possess within that cylinder.
Speak.
The beasts of the dark have desecrated our dead.
They took the body of the guard that was slain by the intruders.
When they were finished with it, they left it in the tunnel.
All the flesh had been torn from the body.
You've apprehended them? l have, O Priest.
Kill them.
Let us now bless the spirit of the earth.
Ishtar has given us the food of the tunnels, the fish of the river, and the sacred milk of the goat.
Above all, we glorify lshtar for giving us power over the beasts of the dark, that they may till the earth beneath us, so that Sharu, king of kings, his children and his children's children may live in strength and rule the world.
So be it.
Well, even if there is a way out, we'll never find it.
Not without help.
You mean the albinos?
No.
Well, surely you don't expect the beasts of the tunnel to help us.
Why should they, after what's been done to them?
Five thousand years of slavery.
The planned degeneration has turned men into beasts.
There's no help there, Jud.
Thank you, Adad.
Lie down, my lord.
Well, go right ahead, Rog.
Don't mind me. l will watch you while you're away.
Away? ln your dreams.
What about you? When do you sleep, Adad? Or do you? l sleep when my sleeping time comes.
Your sleeping time?
But how are you able to tell?
Here, in my heartbeat.
One, two, three.
But you're not counting all the time, are you?
No, l just feel it all the time.
What happens when your heart beats faster? lt matters not. lt is my heart, it is my time.
Look, Adad, you'd better go home.
This is my home.
The King has ordered it so.
Well, never mind the King.
You're free to go. Understand?
Free? What is free?
Well, if you wish to go, you go, and if you wish to stay, you stay.
That's being free.
Then l am free, because l wish to stay.
But you're in danger.
Danger? Why?
Because we're different than your people.
They fear us and may try to harm us.
You're different, too, and if you're with us, it may remind them.
What are you going to do?
Try to get back to our world.
There's nothing beyond darkness, my lord.
Are you sure of that?
Have you never in your life heard of a world of light above the darkness?
No, my lord. Never.
Well, then, let me tell you about it.
The world of light changes color with every heartbeat.
There are mighty rivers and places where the land is covered with living things.
And then there are the cities.
Beautiful cities filled with many people like you and me.
You're speaking of heaven, my lord.
Maybe l am. Maybe l am.
Well, that's one way of doing it.
What is it?
Steam from an underground spring?
Something hotter than that. Lava.
Figure this one out.
You tan hides with tannic acid made from tree bark, right?
What do they use?
Want me to ask them?
No, not now. Let's go.
The Egyptians were able to weave very fine materials out of wool.
The stuff they're weaving here looks like burlap.
Well, the finer cloth is loomed by the priests.
One of their trade secrets. l sure would like to get out of here.
And that is not all.
The King has shown weakness and poor judgment.
He believes in the divinity of these intruders.
Dealing with the divine is our office. lf we abandon the smallest particle of it to outsiders, our position will soon come to naught.
But are these outsiders not divine?
No, they are mortal.
Do they not eat when they are hungry?
Do they not sleep when they are weary?
When the guards attacked them, did not their faces show the fears of mortal men?
But do they not possess the power of heaven?
The cylinder they carry possesses it. lf you had that cylinder, or you, or you, you could use it, too.
And if it is the power of heaven, is it not we who should possess it and use it to control the beasts of the dark, the people, and yes, if need be, even a faltering king himself?
You will therefore follow these intruders wherever they may go, and bring me that cylinder.
Here's something.
No, that's not it either.
That's hopeless, Roger.
Not as long as we're alive.
Why don't we just give up and apply for Sumerian citizenship?
I don't like mushrooms.
Now, don't complain, Rog.
Last night we had cave rat for dinner.
No, why don't we settle down?
Especially you?
Why especially me?
Well, there's Adad.
Just imagine what some future archaeologists would think if they happened to rediscover this world and the wild theories they'd concoct in order to explain the presence of dozens of little Bentleys speaking Sumerian with a Harvard accent, and playing baseball in front of the temple of Ishtar.
The Ishtar Nine, champions of the Little Mushroom League?
Come on.
Let's look around some more.
Yeah.
Is all in order?
In order, Captain.
Shall i feed them?
They're getting weak.
You have your orders.
They're not to be fed until you're told otherwise.
Guards! Sixty lashes!
Please don't interfere.
The beast has committed a crime.
He was hungry.
My orders are to keep them hungry.
Captain, look.
Do you realize you're bringing disaster on our heads, and yours, too?
Did you learn that song as a child?
I did not learn it, i found it.
It's beautiful.
As beautiful as you are.
No, i'm a marked one.
The priests said so.
They are so right.
It's not only the color of your eyes and your hair and your cheek that mark you, but your heart also.
It beats with tenderness.
The love of your ancestors is there.
Love? I do not understand.
Well, if somebody has hurt and his hurt gives you pain, or if somebody has joy and his joy gives you pleasure, that's love.
Adad, do you believe, as your king believes, that i'm one of your gods?
No, my lord.
Our gods are always angry and give orders. You smile.
If i ever get out of here into my world...
The world of light and flowers?
...will you come with me?
Yes, my lord.
My lord.
What is it?
The King wishes to see you at once.
The Captain of the Guards has been found murdered.
The beasts of the dark have done it.
It is possible they intend to revolt.
What about your guards?
Cowards. They tremble at the sight of their own shadows.
We do not want unnecessary bloodshed.
We need the beasts.
But with your cylinder of fire, you could bring them under control.
We will not take part in any plan to punish your slaves.
They are against us.
They are evil.
Ishtar has sent them.
I say to you that she has not.
Take their magic cylinder away from them and you shall see then that they are powerless, and we will have their power.
No, Elinu.
We will not challenge Ishtar.
Have the guards arrest three of the beasts and beat them until they are dead.
It's dead.
And so are we.
As long as they think we're armed, they'll stay away from us.
Come on, help me with these chains.
You're gonna release them?
We can't leave them here.
Why, they attacked us the last time.
The guards forced them to.
Go!
He was trying to say something.
They don't have the power of speech, but they can reason.
And all we can hope is they try to help us.
Ishtar has turned her face away from us because we have sinned.
The intruders are the sinners, and we are to starve because of them.
They are behind the rebellion.
It is they who encourage disobedience so that the beasts of the dark do not produce enough to feed us all.
If we cannot produce enough food, we must reduce our population as it is inscribed on the sacred stones.
We will offer them in sacrifice to our goddess so that the others can live.
In my hand i hold the golden rod, the secret of death.
For death shall appease Ishtar through the spirit bride of sacrifice.
Ishtar, who is married for life to the spirit of our world, to the glory of death.
I have something to show you,
Priest. Please come with me.
Wait. The King must see for himself.
The divine messenger who has gone to heaven.
He was mortal, as we are mortal.
And he is dead, as we shall soon be dead if we do not deal with the intruders.
What do you advise?
Give me freedom to act.
You have it. Destroy them!
Did you ever hear of anyone smoking dried mushrooms?
What?
Oh, nothing. Skip it.
What a pleasant surprise.
Where'd all the food come from?
Slaves back at work?
I don't know, my lord.
The food keeper was very generous.
Delicious.
Sit down, Adad.
Well, why don't you eat?
Royal food is not for servants.
Haven't i told you before that you're not a servant?
Yes.
And what else have i told you?
That i'm just like you.
Correct. Now eat.
In your presence, my lord, i cannot eat.
Adad, i...
I want you to...
My lord. My lord!
They poisoned me.
Seize them.
Guards! Kill them!
We've nothing to fear.
I have the burning light.
The eye of Ishtar.
Adad.
Sunlight.
To your people it was a burning death, but to us it's life.
You see, a long time ago your people came from our world.
You're a living proof that that's true.
But they didn't understand.
That's why they called you the marked one.
It's warm. It's beautiful.
And deadly for our friends of the tunnel.
That's right.
I'm afraid the world of darkness is theirs forever.
The priests must have had this secret for thousands of years.
Then finally the sun became too strong even for them.
You will take me with you?
Well, welcome to our world, Adad.
It's even more beautiful than i imagined.
Hey, Rog, look!
There's our gear.
Adad!

He's passing the previous highest.

There's still the heat barrier.
Will you speak with him, Commander ?
He's near the barrier of control.
It will be difficult for him.

You're reaching the ionosphere.
Your motor will burn out in exactly... five seconds.
Check.
Four, three, two...
That's the burnout.
He's okay.
Take it easy, Dan.
We're reaching maximum test height of 300,000 feet.
You're in modified atmosphere.
She's riding steady.
Feel as though I could go on.
Test your controls and prepare to turn.
Let her go, Chuck.
See what she'll do.
Think he's all right, Doctor ?
Heartbeat is almost normal.
But with release of pressures, judgment may be unsound for some seconds.
- Shall I take over on remote control ?
- No. Give him a few more seconds.
Dan, do you hear me ?
I repeat, do you read me ?
Cannot direct hands toward stabilizers.
Steady me. Steady me.
Electronic controls, take all stabilizers.
- I'm trying, sir, but I can't get equalization.
- Keep at it.
Listen, Dan, this is Dr. Von Essen speaking.
You are weightless.
Without concentration, you cannot coordinate your senses.
Listen to me.
Tell me what to do, Doc.
Tell me what to do.
First, control yourself.
Now, forget everything else, and watch your left hand.
Without taking your eyes off it, put it down... until it is resting on something.
No matter what.
Take your time.
Be quick, Doctor.
If he hits atmosphere at this speed, he'll burn up.
When you have hold with your left hand... do the same with your right.
Bring it slowly forward until you can grasp the stabilizer.
Watch carefully until you are steady.
Now concentrate and you will regain control of Y-12.
You're moving outside the preset radar position.
We're going to lose you.
Can't help it !
Can't help it !
I've got control, but I can't reduce speed !
Radar control,
Y-12 gliding outside preset orbit.
Track five degrees west.
Tracking five degrees west, sir.
You'll never hold him.
He's going !
His only chance is to bounce the atmosphere until he loses enough speed.
- Radar Control, keep tracking west !
- Yes, sir.
Track west. Keep going !
Keep going ! Keep tracking !
Well, if we don't hear soon, we never will.
Why didn't he obey orders, stick to the test plan ?
He should have !
You cannot blame your brother for this tragedy, Commander Prescott.
For a few vital seconds, he was not himself.
I wish I could agree with you, Doctor.
We do not yet understand the physiological conditions... a man may have to endure at such heights.
My brother's always been unpredictable.
He's a heck of a good pilot, the best we ever had.
Well, he knew the limits.
Why did he disobey orders ?
It was a physiological condition clouding his judgment.
Chuck, we've progressed a long way in the development of aviation medicine.
But the conditions we simulate in the high-altitude test chamber... just aren't the real thing.
It's like...
Captain Richard's office.
Commander Prescott speaking.
What ?
Is the pilot all right ?
Now, where ?
Say that again slowly.
Puerco. Yes, yes. I know the place... between Albuquerque and Santa Fe.
Listen, don't let anyone near it.
We'll be right over.
We found Y-12, sir.
Badly damaged, but in one piece.
And Lieutenant Prescott ?
Is he safe ?
Yes, he's all right.
Yes, sir ?
Have Hyatt bring around my car on the double.
- Salvage officer speaking.
- Captain Richards.
Team up the Y-12 crew.
Get 'em loaded and have a salvage crane follow me to Puerco.
I'll radio directions, but get going'.
Well, Commander, looks like you're losing me another night's sleep.
Afraid so, sir.
Commander Prescott, U.S. Navy.
Where's the plane ? just off the road over there.
We're sure glad to see you.
We're mighty cold and hungry.
Should have been off duty a couple hours ago.
Well, thanks for stickin' around.
Where's the pilot ?
Oh, he's around here someplace.
The plane's just over here.
Right. Thanks.
Take it easy, Clancy.
It's me, Whitney. I brought the navy.
Huh. What in, a land yacht ?
You see it come down ?
Yeah, right down the valley.
We took a quick look and radioed in to headquarters.
Where's the pilot ?
The relief patrol took him into town.
Into town ?
But he's okay.
Sure. He looked like a man from Mars in that getup.
Talked sense, but he acted kinda loony.
What do you mean ?
I don't know. Kind of high, I guess.
But I'll tell you one thing...
- I'll send in a report to you in the morning, sir.
Well, she's badly beaten up, but with any luck, the instruments might be okay.
Let's hope so.
Good evening, sir.
Boy, that pilot's the zaniest guy I ever saw.
How come ?
He had me take him into town for a change of clothes.
Said he had some dame to see.
Couldn't even wait for coffee.
Well, I guess I know where that'll be.
Mind if I borrow the car, skipper ?
Sure. We'll ride back with the salvage crew.
- Thank you, sir.
- Take it easy.
Oh, Dan, I wish you were not a test pilot.
It is so dangerous.
Honey, it's my future.
It's our future.
Who's gonna forget the first man in space ?
They don't forget Lindbergh, or the Wright brothers.
- You talk too much.
- You can always shut me up.
I will.
Oh, don't talk with the macaroni.
Answer the door.
- Is Lieutenant Prescott here ?
- Yes.
In there.
But...
Hiya, brother. 
Have a drink.
What the heck's the matter with you ?
You just wrecked $10 million worth of aircraft, and I find you lollygagging around here.
Why aren't you back at the base making out your report ?
As a matter of fact,
I was just on my way.
Okay, wise guy.
Taylor.
Escort Lieutenant Prescott back to the base... and inform the duty officer that he's confined to quarters until further notice.
Yes, sir.
Now get up !
You can see how it is, honey.
I'll phone you soon as I can.
You can pull all the rank you want.
You're very good at doing that.
But just remember this :
You couldn't pilot a kiddy car to cross the other side of the street.
If it weren't for guys like me, you'd be dead ! Nothin' !
Why did you treat him that way ?
Right now he has no business playing house with you.
He's got a job to do and that comes first.
Not always, Commander.
Dan knows what he's doing.
Does he ?
I'm not so sure.
Why don't you quit riding' the boy, Chuck.
He disobeyed orders.
Y-12's a wreck and we were darn lucky to salvage the instruments.
All right. But you got to look at it both ways. just think of the progress we made.
Come in.
Yes, sir ?
Simmons, take this to
Commander Barrett.
- Tell him I'll be there in five minutes.
- Yes, sir.
I got something else here you can worry about.
We're putting Y-13 on a four-week countdown as of tonight.
Four weeks ?
Yeah, the Pentagon just came through.
- We're priority go-ahead. - Mmm.
We'll be really sweating blood to get this on time.
All right, then sweat blood and read your orders.
I have an Apex to free in 30 minutes.
Look at that baby go.
Isn't she beautiful ?
You're, uh, released on Captain Richard's orders.
- It's about time.
- That's not all.
It seems the Pentagon is so impressed with your fame... that you're to pilot Y-13.
That's great !
But you're not so very happy about it, are you ?
I just want to be sure of one thing, that there are no mistakes... that you obey every instruction given to you.
- Your reactions are slow up there.
- That's not the answer I want !
- What do you want me to say ?
- I want you to say that you understand... that you're the pilot, but I give the orders.
Unfortunately, I think you'd do anything for this.
- Get off my back, will you !
- I'll get off your back... as soon as you realize that we're developing a piloted space plane... and not a record-breaking hero !
All right. As I said before, your reaction is slow up there.
Well, we'll see to it that you get plenty of time for a checkout... before the next fight.
Dr. Von Essen will give you a thorough indoctrination... so that your reactions are automatic.
Now get your things together and get over to Aviation Medicine.
Yes, sir.
- Miss Francesca ?
- Yes ?
What are you doing here ?
I'm sorry, Commander, but I'm in a hurry.
Wait...
Chief, what is Miss Francesca doing here ?
Check in' in some material with Dr. Von Essen, sir.
I don't understand you, chief.
What sort of material ?
She's on Dr. Von
Essen's staff, sir.
Aviation Medicine Department.
I wish she was working here.
I'm all for scientists in skirts.
Hmm. You and the rest of the navy.
Come in.
Commander Prescott.
Congratulations.
- Y-13 should be a fine project.
- Oh, thank you, Doctor.
- Sit down. Cigarette ?
- Uh, no. No, thanks.
Say, uh, Doctor, do you, um...
Do you have a Miss Francesca on your staff ?
You do not visit us often enough at the university.
- How long has she been working for you ?
- Some months.
She has charge of the cardiographs... and probably knows more about your brother's heart than he does himself.
Yes. From what I've seen,
I wouldn't be surprised.
She's good for him.
He's quieter, calmer... and in love.
In love ? 
Are you kidding ?
You're too close to your projects, Commander.
You do not notice people enough.
- Are you sure of this ?
- I should not say it otherwise.
Well, what do you know ?
What sort of an idiot does that make me ?
Why in the heck didn't 
Dan say something ?
You don't seem to have your brother's entire confidence.
No, uh, Doctor, I'm afraid I don't.
You wish it were any other man than Dan who should pilot Y-13 ?
Well, he's not the man
I'd personally pick for the job.
Why not ?
I just don't think it's in his nature... to stay inside any organized pattern.
It's not an unnatural characteristic to find in a man who risks his life for a new achievement.
Maybe so. But on a project such as this,
I'd prefer to have someone more reliable.
Well, he will be in my care until you are ready for the fight.
I'll pay some attention to his psychology.
Yes, would you let the psychiatrists work on him, Doctor ?
Make him understand that even though he's up there in space, alone... he still has to obey orders.
Attention all personnel... stand by for Y-13 rocket motor testing.
Y-13 tied down.
Fueling completed.
Stand clear for test. Stand clear for test.
- Like to go over the fight plan again ?
- What, again ?
- I know it blindfolded.
- I know. Let's go over it again, huh ?
Okay. Okay.
We blast off at 45,000 feet, crash the heat barrier... out into the stratosphere in six seconds.
Fifty seconds later,
I break through the chemo sphere.
- And you switch off your refrigeration plant.
- Check. But keep tracking me.
Buffeting in Y-12 was so severe
I couldn't read my instruments.
- Oh, that and the barrier of control.
- Mmm, yeah, that's really tough.
It's as much as you can do to hold on.
You sure you can take over when you reach ionosphere ?
If you want to, we can take you past rocket burnout.
No, no. That won't be necessary.
Now that I know what to expect,
I'll be ready.
Y-13 countdown. Zero minus 54 minutes.
Repeat, zero minus 54 minutes.
Well, von Essen did a good job.
You look pretty good.
Never felt better. I wish he was comin' today, though. I like to have him around.
The air force has priority today.
Y-13 countdown.
All personnel assemble.
All personnel assemble for takeoff.
Well, good luck.
And you take it easy.
Thanks, Chuck. But don't worry.
I'll bring you back all the dope you need for Y-14, and then some.
Come on. Let's go, huh ?
Right. five, four, three, two, one, drop.
Y-13 to Control. Y-13 to Control.
"G" pressure gone. I'm weightless.
- But gyros holding steady.
- Okay, Dan, we're with you.
Now check controls for atmosphere bite.
I'm checking now.
- Steady her up. That's enough !
- Take it easy, Chuck.
Approaching 500,000 feet. Check ?
Check.
You're doing fine, boy.
Now, commence your turn in 15 seconds.
Chuck, she feels like she'd go on forever !
Stop talking ! Concentrate !
- Your altitude is 600,000 feet.
Prepare to turn.
Dan ? Y-13. Y-13.
Commence your turn immediately.
No, sir, I'm going straight up.
First man into space !
Commence your turn !
Commence your turn !
Sir, we're losing contact.
Switch to remote control !
Over to remote control, sir.
- Dan, are you reading me ?
- So long. See you in space !
- Dan ! Dan, are you reading me ?
Are you reading me ?
Remote control won't respond, sir.
- He'll be out of atmosphere any second now.
- He's still climbing.
The fool's fred his emergency boost !
This is an emergency.
Keep all radio beams open.
Instruct all radar to keep scanning constantly. Bring in everyone.
Warn all spotters.
This is an intercontinental priority.
Yes, sir.
Well, he's on his own now.
The first man into space.
He'll either hit the moon or orbit the Earth the rest of his life.
Control ! Control !
I've done it ! 250 miles !
I'm going to turn now.
This is Y-13.
Y-13 calling from over 250 miles in space.
My rocket motors are burned out, and my gyro stabilizers cannot turn me at this height.
I'm going to use release mechanism to catapult myself and the nose away from the plane.
Control ! Control ! Are you reading me ?
This is Y-13.
Control ! Control ! Are you reading me ?
This is Y-13.
Y-13 calling Control !
I'm running into some meteorite dust !
Pressing ejector button now !
Wish me luck.
Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. Si. Si.
Kalinsky ! Yeah. Yeah, sure.
We'll take care of it right away.
Yes, sir ?
Some Mexican farmer called Sanchez.
He says he caught sight of a parachute floating down.
It landed just outside his farm.
I don't know, he says there's something like a front half of a plane... or something attached to the chute.
- Where's he located, sir ?
- Just off Route 17.
About 10 miles south of Alvarado.
You better get the nearest patrol car out there right away.
- Yes, sir.
- Meantime, I'll call the navy base.
Might have something to do with their rocket fringe.
Hello. Get me the duty officer at the navy base.
Smash-up on the south highway.
Bus full of people and two trucks.
No report on deaths.
Should have word from car 51 any minute now.
- Yeah.
- We got two witnesses.
- They're definite about the way it happened.
- Uh-huh.
Krupke's getting their reports now, and he'd like you to follow up.
Yeah. Okay.
Have him call me back.
- Morning, Commander. Glad you could make it.
- Morning.
I'm Wilson, Assistant Chief of State Police.
Well, thanks for phoning in, Chief.
Uh, whereabouts is it ?
Oh, just up there a ways in the bushes.
- Any... Anyone hurt ? Any damage ?
- No.
Dropped about a half a mile from the nearest farm.
Came down like a dame in a feather bed.
No sign of the pilot though, huh ?
Well, uh, you better come and look for yourself.
Well, what do you make of it, Commander ?
I don't know. It's, uh, too early to say.
Uh, I've never seen anything like this before.
It'll have to go into the test lab.
Well, the pilot's had it.
That's for certain.
Smashed the canopy in.
Yeah, he couldn't live up there in space.
- You got a minute, sir ?
- Why ?
Could you come up and take a look at what we've got up here ? There's a farm.
- You okay ?
- Oh, yeah. Yeah, I'm okay.
Salvage crew's right behind me.
Oh, uh, look, will you have one of your men stand guard ?
I've got to go in to Albuquerque and make a call.
Oh, sure. I'll be here myself.
Well, thanks for your help.
Always glad to help the navy.
What's the trouble ? 
Oh, it's this Mexican farmer.
He's had a lot of cattle slaughtered for no reason I can see.
- Well, let's go and see.
- Okay.
I knew this would happen.
I didn't want him to go.
Yes, I understand.
How could you understand ?
- To you, Dan was just a piece of machinery.
- Now, that's not true.
You wanted him to risk his life.
I had to put Y-13 into space and Dan as a pilot because those are my orders.
- Orders !
- Tia...
Dan couldn't exist unless he were risking his life.
If he weren't piloting Y-13, he'd find his own brand of danger somewhere else.
He had to prove he was the best.
If you knew all this, why didn't you try and stop him ?
I did.
I don't believe you.
I've been trying to stop him ever since we were kids.
He was always climbing the highest tree... or swimming further than anyone else.
With Dan it was all the way or nothing.
He wanted to be the first man into space.
And he was.
Before we lost track of him, he was higher than any man had ever been.
Higher than any man.
That's all you can think of.
I wanted him to give up flying, to settle down.
If he had, do you think he'd have ever been happy ?
No, you're right.
I just can't believe he's gone.
I've got to get back to the base.
Will you be all right here alone ?
Alone...
Yes, I'll be all right.
Well...
Chuck...
I didn't mean to blame you.
Look, I'll, um, stop by the Aviation 
Medicine Department tomorrow... and see you if you'd like.
Thank you. 
I'd like that.
Good-bye, Tia.
We're, uh, running some metallurgical tests.
It seems as if the skin was subjected to some sort of incrustation we've never heard of.
Any idea how high he went ?
In weakened gravity pull, he could go a long way.
Could be anything... 250, 350 miles.
Chutes seem okay.
The usual signs of scorching.
Yeah. The, uh, automatic escape mechanism operated perfectly too.
And this breaking chute opened just right, as soon as it hit full atmosphere density.
But it was too late to save Dan.
Nobody could live once the canopy burst.
You'd be dead in a second.
Have a look over here.
This incrustation has some remarkable qualities.
You see ? 
Nothing.
Nothing at all.
X-rays will not pass through it.
- No luck here either, sir.
- Thank you.
This is the infrared photograph.
But the rays do not penetrate to show us what is below the surface.
And here under the ultraviolet lamp...
I can't understand it.
It's resistant to any identification or penetration test we can do here.
We'll take a photograph anyway.
There may be some reflection we cannot observe, though I doubt it.
Hmm. So far, then, your tests are negative.
Well, let's hope the metallurgical report will give us a line.
- Let's hope.
- Let me know as soon as you have it.
Well, good night, Doctor.
Good night, Chuck.
- Good night.
- Good night, sir.
You know, you better get some sleep.
I will, skipper. Thanks.
What is this stuff, Doctor ? Do you think a chemical breakdown could tell us anything ?
We do not even know the primary reactor.
I'll send a sample to my own laboratory.
We may find the answer more quickly.
Yeah, l, uh... I can't get him out of my mind, Doctor.
I can just see him up there now in the cockpit.
He, uh, wanted you there today.
Maybe if you had been...
- If only I had...
- You mustn't blame yourself, Chuck.
Maybe you're right.
Look, I'll check with you first thing in the morning.
Yes, I'll do that.
Thank you, sir, and good-bye.
Come in.
Hi, Chuck. Glad you came by.
I want to talk to you.
Have you seen this, skipper ?
Uh, not the headline.
Read further down.
"In the past 24 hours death has struck in mysterious and terrifying ways.
Type of wound inflicted is fearful and inhuman."
Read the middle part, sir.
It talks about the slaughtered cattle.
That farm is right next door to where Y-13 fell.
I've got a call in now to Chief Wilson.
I don't get the tie-up.
- Yeah ?
- Call for Commander Prescott, sir.
Thank you, sir.
Commander Prescott.
Yes, Wilson. Where are you ?
Alameda ?
What ?
Yes, well, I'll be there as soon as I can.
It's like I said, Commander, about the wounds on the Mexican's cattle.
Look, this one's the same.
It's like a tearing jag there across the throat. See ?
Who or what could cause this wanton destruction ?
Well, I don't know, but it seems to like the taste of blood.
See, it... it looks like it's been scooped up or something.
And look here. Look.
Takes more than human strength to do this.
Unless he had an ax.
- Chief.
- Yeah ?
- Give me your flashlight, would you ?
- Sure.
Look there. See on the edge of the wound there ?
What ?
Those little shiny specks.
Oh, yeah, yeah. I see.
That's funny.
I never noticed those before.
What do you suppose they are ?
When you do an autopsy, will you send a sample of that... to a Dr. Von Essen in Aviation Medicine ?
Sure.
Think they mean something ?
I don't know.
But I'd like to take a look at that Mexican's cattle.
Okay. We'll go over as soon as we're through here.
Well, there you are, Commander.
Take a look.
There's a dozen more like it in the lower pasture.
Esta muerta.
; Que cosa terrible !
Who want kill Clara ?
She win many prizes at feria.
See what I mean ?
It's the same thing.
The throat ripped right open.
Mmm. Looks like it kills whatever it comes near.
Yeah.
You have any idea what sort of a weapon could cause such a gash ?
No, not yet, but we're working on it.
Wait a minute. Shine your light.
- Oh, yeah. Those shiny specks again.
- Mm-hmm.
Would you send a sample of this also over to Aviation Medicine ?
Why, sure.
What are you trying to say, Commander ?
That something from outer space came out of that missile ?
I don't know, but I'd like to have them compared... with the sample we took from the nurse at the blood bank.
Okay.
You think it's gonna help us find the killer ?
Well, I can't say.
But let's hope we catch it before it does any more killing.
Well, it can't escape my roadblocks forever.
But if you've got any ideas, Commander, you've gotta let me in on 'em.
Here. Lift that head. Yeah.
What is it ?
Looks like a high-altitude oxygen lead.
I've gotta get back to the base.
I've got a lot of work to do.
But don't worry.
I'll keep in touch.
Yeah, sure.
Pero, senores, quieren pagar mi ganado ?
- I gotta go now.
- Okay.
- I'll be back this way next Thursday.
- Okay.
Don't forget to keep my side warm.
Don't worry. I won't let it get cold.
Uh, hello, I'm Commander Prescott.
I'd like to see a Miss Francesca.
I'll see if she's free.
They're just finishing an altitude test.
Commander Prescott to see Miss Francesca.
I'll bring him down.
- Come with me, Commander.
- Thank you.
Watch out for sphere density and final reactions carefully.
Only 10 seconds to normal.
Right. Open the chamber.
Careful with his helmet.
Hello, Tia.
Hello, Commander. Good to see you.
- How are you feeling ?
All right.
I've got plenty to do. It keeps my mind off of it.
Yes, it does help, doesn't it ?
I was on the way over... to see about some blood tests the police sent over this morning... and I thought I'd stick my head in and say hello.
That's very nice.
Do you want me to see if they are ready ?
I'd appreciate it. Thanks.
Pathological.
Hello ? Are those blood tests ready for Commander Prescott ?
They are ?
Could you please send them down ?
He's waiting for them.
Thank you.
Well, that's fast work.
We try our best.
- Do you want some coffee ?
- Yes, I would. Thank you.
- Black ?
- Please.
- Sugar ?
- No, thanks. I'm fine.
You look tired.
Yeah. Well, maybe this'll help.
How did you ever end up in Albuquerque ?
I came with my father two years ago.
He and Dr. Von Essen were very good friends.
They were at school together.
And when my father died,
Dr. Von Essen asked me to stay on and help him.
What part of Italy are you from ?
Turin, from the north of Italy.
- Ever get homesick ?
- Not anymore.
It's strange... The first time
I met you, I thought...
Well, it just goes to show you how wrong a person can be.
- Do you want some more coffee ?
- No, thanks. That's fine.
Thank you.
"Embedded in both samples are innumerable particles of meteorite dust...
"that show no sign of structural damage...
"such as would be expected from passage through atmosphere.
"Detailed analysis will be needed before a confirmed opinion can be given.
A full report is requested on the origin of the dust."
Has this got anything to do with Dan ?
I don't know.
Look, Tia, I've got to get back to the base.
I'll see you again as soon as I can.
- Thanks for the coffee.
- Good-bye, Chuck.
We have the results of the metallurgical tests.
Hang on a second, Doctor.
I'd like you to take a look at this.
Later, later. 
Come over here.
I want to show you something.
Well, uh...
This is a sample of our new secret alloy... of which the fuselage of Y-13 is made.
You know the terrific heat and pressure it will stand.
This is a piece from the fuselage which was coated with this strange substance.
Notice the metal underneath has not been affected.
Now, this is a piece we removed from the stabilizer... that has escaped being encrusted.
Look. It has undergone a complete transformation.
It does not even retain a resemblance to metal.
It's like, uh, crumbling carbon.
And if I grind it... there's nothing left but powder.
What could cause this transformation, Doctor ?
Difficult to say.
Possibly cosmic rays we do not yet know or understand.
And where it is coated, this transformation hasn't occurred. Right ?
Exactly.
So then it could be that this is some sort of cosmic protection.
Could be.
Commander Prescott, report to Captain Richard's office, please.
Commander Prescott, report to Captain Richard's office, please.
I'll, uh, be right back, Doctor.
Although I accept your explanation, senor captain... there is no doubt that it was providence that His Excellency was not killed.
But the place where the tail section of Y-13 fell... is 10 miles from your town.
What is 10 miles, senor, when you do not know where your missiles go ?
- What's he getting at ?
- He's referring to the rocket that almost hit Juarez.
But that was a captured German V-2.
It happened nearly 10 years ago.
What is 10 years, senor ?
You still do not know where your missiles go.
He has the whole story, sir.
The low-flying projectile you lost over Argentina last year... and the Apex missile that disappeared last week.
That is so, senor captain.
Where are they, eh ?
As if I knew. If they're not up there, they must be down here.
Glad you're here, Commander.
Meet Sr. Ramon DeGareara, consul for Mexico at Santa Fe.
Mr. Harold Atkins, State Department.
Commander Prescott.
Mr. Atkins.
It seems that His Excellency, the minister for social services... was opening a new bull ring in San Pedro...
Senores, it was the moment of truth.
A great silence descend upon the crowd... 5,000 people.
10,000 eyes, senor comandante, fixed on the blade.
When suddenly there is a roar from space.
It was greater than the roar of the "oles" that would greet the final triumph.
All of the eyes look up.
And when they looked down...
- He missed the kill.
- Of course !
Suddenly there is a tremendous...Crrrrrrr!
The crowd scatter.
The bull is scared, jump over the barrera, nearly into the lap of His Excellency.
Then the bull escaped... and wrecked the market.
They found what was left of Y-13 tail section later on in the day.
Y-13 ? How soon can we get a salvage crew down there ?
I'm afraid it's not quite as simple as that.
There are formalities and compensations.
Si, senores.
Here is a list, senor captain, but, uh, it's not complete.
20,000 pesos !
Must have been the bull of the century.
Senor captain, it was a bull... worthy of Manolete himself.
Senor Consul, I hope you will cooperate by allowing us to salvage the tail section.
- I will use my personal influence.
- Thank you.
And the United States government will see about adequate compensation.
Please impress upon His Excellency that both our countries will benefit... from permission to send a salvage crew onto the crash site... at the earliest possible moment.
Of course, senor captain.
Well, uh, buenos dias, senores.
Buenos dias.
Buenos dias.
Oh, and, uh, captain...
I hope the next time you lose a missile... you shoot it in some other direction.
Boy ! We free a dozen missiles every week.
Because something goes wrong once in a while, this kind of thing has to happen.
Now, look, Chuck.
Wilson's just called.
Things are getting pretty serious.
There have been three more killings.
- Three ?
- Yeah.
- Did he give any details ?
- Mm-hmm.
A truck driver at a roadside diner just outside Los Alamos... and an elderly couple out by Green Valley.
Green Valley ? Why, that's...
How is it traveling those distances in such a short space of time ?
It can drive.
Wilson found a truck with a steering column and foot controls bent so far out of shape... it can't be driven another yard.
Ah. I'm beginning to get a picture.
We know it has great strength... it's clumsy, smashes everything it touches... and it has mechanical knowledge.
What makes you think this has anything to do with Y-13 ?
I'd like to have you look at something in the lab.
Excuse me.
- Captain Richards.
- Commander Larsen, sir.
The S-21 rocket motor is ready on test bed number two.
- We free in 30 minutes.
- Hold it.
- How long you gonna need me ?
- I'll make it as fast as I can.
Delay your test by one hour.
Fire at 1730.
But, sir, we're all set !
Look, it's about time you boys realized there's more than one baby in this nursery.
Delay your test till 1730.
I can give you 30 minutes.
Let's go.
Assuming that there is life in outer space... it would have to create a protective coating... in order to survive those destructive elements up there.
You mean, like the primeval creatures that crawled out of the sea... and grew skin to protect themselves against the sun ?
Yes. Y-13 has penetrated a new world.
So this coating was formed on Y-13... to protect it from those destructive forces in space.
It's an interesting theory, but I don't...
But suppose the same thing happened in the cockpit.
Let me show you something.
This.
If you notice, this is flexible and... harmless to touch.
Let me demonstrate on this piece of sponge rubber here.
I'll wrap this around my hand.
Now watch this.
Holy cow !
If this were a human throat, that's how it could be slashed.
Look closely into these gashes.
Meteorite dust.
The same as in the wounds of all the victims... meteorite dust.
So, there's only one interpretation
I can put on all this.
This... monster... kills... but only because, for some reason or other, it needs this blood.
No one has seen it and lived.
What are you getting at, Chuck ?
I'm afraid this monster is Dan.
- Say, that guy's off course.
- Yeah, he's loaded, okay.
Here we go.
Hold on.
I'm gonna take him !
Okay. I'll handle it.
Dan's metabolism must have changed.
But what form has it taken ?
Without knowing the kind of cosmic rays to which Dan was subjected... and their effect on the physical basis of life...
I couldn't say.
Perhaps it caused a blood change.
Boy !
It's incredible to think of your brother as a blood-drinking m...
Tia, would you get Dan's metabolism charts and cardiograms ?
We're gonna need your help.
Yes, l-l-I have them all here.
Suppose when the canopy burst... his blood absorbed a high content of nitrogen.
Then he would die.
The human body cannot survive a rarified atmosphere... without the protection of space suits and pressurized cabins.
But you're forgetting about that protective coating on Y-13.
- And if it formed quickly enough on Dan...
- Yes, it might have kept him alive.
And if, instead of death, a new metabolism was created... which starved his body and his brain of blood... what then ?
We know very little.
Only that by some mysterious means the cells controlling growth and reproduction... are changed by exposure to some cosmic rays.
Beyond that, I could only guess.
Yes, I'm only guessing too, Doctor.
But I think Dan would be more at home in space... than on Earth.
What has been going on hasn't been wanton killing... but only his need to replace this blood that has been changed.
He would need some proper transfusions.
It would be useless to drink it.
Yes, unless he was obeying some animalistic instinct.
Your hunch was right, Commander.
- Look at this.
- It's Dan's space helmet.
- Where'd you find it ?
- Not too far from here.
In a car with his latest victim.
And now we know what he looks like... a great big, lumbering, deformed monster.
It seems you can't kill him.
The bullets bounce off.
It's the coating.
It's a perfect protection, like armor plate.
I've assigned a platoon of marines to help Wilson.
Look, I... I know he's gotta be stopped, but... remember, he's still
Lieutenant Prescott, and... and if he can drive a car, he still retains some intelligence.
He's not all monster.
Well, what do you suggest ? We just let him roam the state, killing at random ?
No, Chief, that's not what I meant !
Well, look, we've got the works on him.
Next time we fight him, we'll try tear gas first.
If that doesn't work, let the marines blast him.
Stands to reason, Chuck.
If we can't stop him, we gotta destroy him.
I know, I know.
In the meantime,
I gotta talk to Washington.
Doctor, can you take me to your office ?
I wanna get a long-distance conference line open.
Of course, Captain.
Come with me.
I'd like you along, Chief.
Chuck, why did this have to happen ?
Tia, we're conquering a new world.
The dangers have to be faced.
Someone has to start.
- But why Dan ?
- Who could stop him ?
I couldn't, even though I tried.
You couldn't either.
No, I couldn't.
No, though you were right about one thing.
It was a piece of machinery that I wanted in the cockpit of Y-13, not Dan.
It is hard to remember sometime that people matter more than machines.
It is...
Well, he can't breathe !
In there !
Stop fringe ! Leave him alone !
Get out of here and warn the others to stay away from him !
We've got to get to von Essen, tell him to open up a high-altitude chamber.
Come on.
- Where's your nearest P.A. system ?
- Reception hall.
You'd better get to von Essen.
I'll stick with Dan. Go on.
Dan ! Dan, listen to me !
It's Chuck !
Listen, I tried to...
Attention, everyone !
Do not leave your offices !
Don't go into the corridor ! Your life is in danger if you go into the corridor !
Dr. Von Essen, he's going the wrong way.
Try and direct him on the P.A. system.
I'll follow him.
Captain, why don't you let me call my men and blast him ?
Forget it.
I'll take full responsibility.
Dan, listen to me !
You are in the wrong corridor.
Remember the building.
From the reception hall you should turn right.
Do not go straight on.
Turn right !
Dan, you have come a long way to find me... and I am very near.
If you are following my directions correctly... you will be approaching a staircase... leading to the high-altitude chamber... where I am waiting for you.
Remember, you must turn left onto the staircase.
If you are on the staircase... you are almost there.
Dan, try hard to remember.
The chamber is at the end of the corridor... leading straight from the bottom of the staircase.
Take your time, Dan.
I'm here in the high-altitude chamber... waiting to help you.
Come straight into the chamber.
He's coming this way.
Captain, open the door to the chamber.
- Larsen ?
- Yes, Doctor ?
Take Mr. Wilson over to the atmosphere controls.
Get as many recorders in operation as you can.
Look out, skipper !
With those hands he'll never be able to connect the inside controls.
- I'm going in.
- Chuck, you can't !
- I've got to.
- Chuck !
- Dr. Von Essen, can you hear me ?
- Yes, Chuck.
Start altering atmosphere immediately.
- Take it up as high and as fast as you can.
- All right, Chuck.
Proceed, Larsen.
Open inlet valve.
Allow for rise to 30,000 feet in 60 seconds.
It's being done, Chuck.
Dan. Dan, it's Chuck.
Your brother. Don't you know me ?
Chuck. We want to...
We want to help you.
We want to help you, Dan.
Dan.
Dan, don't you know me ?
Chuck !
It's Chuck !
Don't you know me ?
Ch... Ch-Chuck ?
Dan, we're trying to help you.
Sit down in the pilot's seat.
Sit down !
That's right. 
Back up.
Easy.
Sit down in the pilot's seat.
Back up. 
Back up down at...
That's right.
Dr. Von Essen, get me some oxygen, quick.
All right, Chuck.
Dan.
Listen.
Dr. Von Essen is here.
He wants to help you.
Dan,
I'm here at the window.
Dr. Von Essen.
Doctor ?
I've been searching for you.
Everything seems strange and dark.
I c-couldn't find you !
Tell me about it, Dan.
If I know what's happened,
I can help you.
Under this stuff...
I feel like I'm suffering from some terrible disease... like I've got no blood in my veins.
But the rarified atmosphere we are giving you, it helps ?
Like clean, fresh air.
I can breathe and think again.
We're up to 30,000 feet.
Can Chuck take any more ?
Be still, Chuck.
Don't exert yourself.
Take it very steadily up to 38,000 feet, but no more.
Go on, Dan.
There's not much to tell.
I have no memory.
Only an instinct to stay alive... until I found you.
I've been groping my way... through a maze of fear and doubt.
We're steady at 38,000.
Hold it there.
Dan, to find out what's wrong with you...
I must make metabolism and blood pressure tests.
All right, Doctor.
Dan, can you tell us what happened up there in space ?
It was like running into the tail end of a hurricane... only it was a stream of meteorite dust we hit.
At first it was like
50,000 machine guns... all hammering at once.
First the canopy... and then my... my visor melted.
I thought my blood was starting to boil.
Then this coating started to form... fast, cooling and protective.
But it was too late.
The last thing I remember was... pressing the button of the nose ejector.
Then I... I thought I died.
How high did you go, Dan ?
About 250 miles.
Maybe 300.
I don't know.
Chuck, did you hear that ?
Yeah, Dan. I'm listening.
You thought I was kidding... when I said I'd bring back all the dope you wanted.
Well, I've got it all.
With a covering of this stuff...
Y-14 will be able to go through that meteorite dust... straight up... l-It will be able to... go on... forever.
Rest, Dan. Rest.
He can't breathe.
Take it higher.
Chuck, i-it's no good.
I'm finished.
We shall take him higher.
But if we do, we'll kill Chuck.
- Tia.
- Yes, Dan ?
I'm sorry things had to happen this way.
But, you see, I...
I just... had to be... the first man... into space.
Neutralize atmosphere !
Right, Captain. Open the door.
No, Tia.
- Take care of Dan, will you ?
- Sure, sure.
There's nothing we can do.
You know, Doctor... this is the part of my job I dread.
Y-13 cost Dan his life.
And we go ahead with Y-14 soon.
I wonder if we've learned enough.
The conquest of new worlds always makes demands on human life.
And there will always be men who will accept the risks.
[dramatic music plays]
[sirens blare]
General Treegar.
At 0300 this morning, the expeditionary X-1 rocket ship, missing for 61 days, was sighted by Mount Palomar, drifting in orbit some 90,000 miles out in space.
All attempts to establish radio communication have failed so far.
We don't know if anyone is left alive on board.
The MR-1 appears to be a dead ship.
We've had no contact with the rocket since it entered Mars orbit over two months ago and reported preparing to land on the planet.
The ship was believed to have crashed in the landing attempt.
But she didn't!
Gentlemen, the Mars rocket must be retrieved and brought back to Earth intact!
That's a tall order, George.
I know, but the recording instruments on that ship contain priceless information covering the entire trip.
We must have it.
Professor Weiner, what are our chances?
They depend on several factors, general.
The MR-1 is, of course, equipped with robot control, which can be activated by remote triggering from Earth, if they're operative.
The Nevada base is alerted to handle it.
- They're on standby.
- Go on, Professor.
If there's enough fuel on board, we can send the ship homing for the Nevada base.
If the fuel holds out through the re-entry deceleration, we can set her down safely.
Here's another if: what if there is someone on board, alive?
Major Ross, has communications established any contact?
No, sir. None.
It could be radio failure.
Someone must have taken the ship off Mars.
The unexpected, remotely-controlled acceleration of, uh, of...
Five, six Gs.
...five, six Gs could be dangerous to them, even fatal!
And how long will they last if we leave them out there?
Then it's decided.
We take off for Nevada at once.
[man speaking faintly over speaker]
[indistinct chatter]
We're getting it now, sir, on the radar telescope screen.
There she is.
Good.
Are you ready?
Yes.
Activate!
Attention, please.
Minus one minute.
Repeat. Minus one minute.
Start final countdown.
Tracking, tracking.
[man continues speaking faintly over speaker]
[man] Rotary fuel pumps on.
Recording tapes running.
Minus 30 seconds, minus 30.
Mark!
Main guiding gyros starting.
Running true.
Running true.
Minus 20 seconds, minus 20.
Remote-control firing switches...
On!
Ten seconds.
Nine, eight,
seven, six,
five, four,
three, two,
one, fire!
She's off!
Great.
Then there is fuel aboard.
Right! But there's only one question: how much?
Well done, Professor.
Davis, I want the arrival time of the ship computed.
Notify me as soon as you have it.
Yes, sir.
[newscaster] The answers to this and the many other questions
posed by anxious officials may come tonight,
when an attempt will be made to land the Mars rocket ship
at a remote air force base in Nevada.
There is still the question of fuel:
does the ship have enough fuel left
for a safe deceleration?
Or will it burn up in our atmosphere
like a blazing meteor?
The world waits with suspense to learn the fate
of the ship's crew of four,
seen here in newsreel shots
prior to the departure of the MR-1.
Colonel Tom O'Bannion,
United States air force, the pilot navigator.
Dr. Iris Ryan, brilliant young authority
on the sciences of biology and zoology,
daughter of the late
Professor Alfred Ryan.
Professor Theodore Gettell, the designer of the rocket ship
and the world's foremost authority
on space and rocketry.
And chief warrant officer Sam Jacobs,
electronics and radar expert.
The prayers of a grateful nation tonight
will be offered in the hope that these four survived
their history-making flight.
- Five minutes more.
- Yeah.
What do you think?
Anyone aboard? Alive, I mean?
- We'll know soon enough.
- Yeah.
Hey, look!
- You know what I think?
- What?
That thing up there, it's a flying coffin.
Looks good so far.
Colonel Davis, anything on the distant-radiation counter?
Negative.
Radiation monitors in position.
[woman]
Radiation monitors, check.
Attention, please.
This is a repeat of previous instructions.
No one is to approach the ship unless ordered by Control.
I repeat, no one is to approach the ship unless so ordered.
[static noise]
[man] Radiation monitors, proceed to the rocket.
Start your check.
[man speaking faintly over speaker]
All counts still in the green zone.
[siren blares]
Hull radiation within safety zone.
Good.
Radiation monitors, stand back.
Recovery squad, move up.
No shielding necessary to open airlock.
Monitors, stand by to check interior radiation.
Hold it! Look!
[man] Recovery squad, hold!
[man 2] Someone's alive.
The girl!
To hell with radiation!
Let's go!
Come on, let's go!
[sirens blare]
[indistinct chatter]
Stretcher bearers!
[man] Aw, come on, Sarge, give me a break, will ya?
- [man 1] Who is it?
- [man 2] Can't see his face.
Hey, what is it, man?
Come on, Iris.
Anything that can be done for him will be done.
- How can anyone cope with that?
- [car engine starts]
Come on, Dr. Ryan, we'll follow.
[siren blares]
I've given him a sedative.
Should keep him quiet.
He's running a high temperature.
Dr. Gordon, that... that growth...
What are we up against?
- I don't know.
- It's spreading rapidly.
Do you have any idea what it might be?
No, I haven't yet.
If we only knew how or by what he was infected, we might know how to combat the disease, but we're working in the dark.
What about the tape records?
Has anything been learned from them?
That's just it.
General Treegar informed me that there are no records.
No tapes at all?
Yes, many of them.
Marked and filed from the first day out.
They've examined about half of them by now, all of them empty.
Nothing on them?
Silent, as though they'd been erased by some powerful magnetic force.
Treegar expects they're all like that.
Then we may never know.
We have one chance: the girl.
She is actually our only hope.
If she could give us a lead...
What is Dr. Ryan's condition?
Exhaustion, shock.
She's resting.
We should be able to talk to her in a couple of hours.
We have very little time.
I hope she comes through.
Dr. Ryan, will you talk to us now?
I'll try.
How is he?
Will he be all right?
We're doing everything we can.
What happened to him?
I don't know.
I can't remember.
Iris, a lot will depend on what you can tell us.
Please, try to remember.
How was he infected?
By What?
I can't...
I can't remember.
Why don't you start at the beginning?
Tell us everything that happened from the day you left.
It may help clear your mind.
Yes. Yes, yes, I'll try.
The takeoff was as we expected.
We reached escape velocity, and Tom cut in the steady
1-G acceleration rockets.
We were all in high spirits as we finished our flight-check.
It's not much different from the dry run in the space-test cabin on the base, huh?
A lot easier, if you ask me.
No "Eager Treegar" to throw imaginary problems at us.
That's what the man said, Sam.
"The trip will probably be boring routine." [chuckles]
Just so you blasé space travelers don't get too bored, the radiation count is jumping.
Radioactive meteor?
Looks like it.
Both the radar scope pattern and the erratic gamma-count fit.
Well, let's double check, hm?
- Visual direct, too.
- Right.
[electronic beeping increasing in frequency]
Meteor confirmed.
Intersecting course.
[beeping frequency decreases]
- Safety margin adequate.
- [whistles]
I wish my parents could have seen this.
They spent their lives making it possible.
Mars, the red planet.
Our destination.
Look, both moons are visible.
Hey, two moons, what a place for romance, huh?
And songwriters.
♪ Two moons
Da da da da da da da da ♪
Let's close your mouth and the port guards, huh?
No use getting the view plates scratched up by meteor dust.
[beeping]
I know, I know, okay, okay!
MR-1 to EB-9.
Come in, please.
Oh, Sam, get it all on tape, will ya?
I've got it on the auxiliary tape, sir.
[man] MR-1, this is EB-9. Over.
MR-1 to EB-9, condition A, condition A.
Everything's under control.
Over.
We're still in our own back yard.
The radio time-lag is only a few seconds.
Wait till it's a couple of hours.
Our conversation is going to be a real drag then.
[chuckling]
[man] MR-1, base computations confirm report.
You are on course, on schedule.
Hey, you look real good up there. Over and out.
Thanks a lot. Over and out.
Good old mother hen watching over her four little chicks.
We're thousands of miles out in space.
It's hard to believe.
Yeah, any minute now,
I expect to see
General Treegar come through that hatch and say, "All right, enough work for today.
Let's everybody go out to Tony's and have a little drink."
Well, that would be a little hard to do.
Tony's is 30,000 miles from here.
Well, we wanna be able to face reality on our watch.
Come on, Sam.
Let's get some rest, huh?
Okay, Professor, I dig.
It's really happening.
You know, Irish, reminds me of when I was a kid.
I can just see you.
I remember when I got my first dog.
I was crazy about that dog.
I wanted him to sleep in my room, but my family wouldn't allow it.
I used to go downstairs a dozen times during the night to make sure that he was there.
- Then you were sure.
- Uh-huh.
And pretty soon, people will be just as sure of space travel as I was of my dog.
And as I'd like to be of you.
Makes Broadway look like a dark alley.
When we get back, Irish... how about exploring that dark alley...
Together?
You, Colonel, sir... may have a date.
[Sam] MR-1 to EB-9.
MR-1 to EB-9.
Report 7-9.
Time: 17 days, 1103 hours.
Position:
"Triangle Easy Fox Baker."
On course, on schedule.
Condition A.
Over and out.
Hey, when's chow, huh?
Comin' up. Come on, Tom.
You can help me with the rations.
I'd rather be carving a thick steak at Tony's.
Make it medium rare and I'll join you.
Will you take a rain check?
- If it won't bounce.
- [chuckles]
Hm. Here we are between two dots.
We could miss either one of 'em, and never know it.
Mars rocket one, ration B.
Mars... the angry red planet.
Sounds so foreboding, doesn't it?
Mars.
Ancient God of war.
Afraid, Irish?
A little.
Apprehensive, I guess.
Oh, we all are or we wouldn't be human.
I know this is a funny way for a scientist to feel, but...
I wonder if some things aren't better unknown.
That's what they said on the Santa Maria before they discovered the new world.
By mistake.
You know, Irish, you're the first scientist
I've ever known with lovely, long red hair.
And you're the first pilot
I've ever gone to Mars with.
And listen, my name is Iris, not Irish.
I never know if you're calling me by name or nationality.
When I call you by name, you'll know it.
"So Oola ran screaming across the burning Martian sands as the monster Ongolur relentlessly pursued her, his five arms reaching hungrily for her.
To be continued next week."
[chuckles]
And that was the last issue before we took off.
[electronic beep]
Mars...
Martians, monsters.
I wonder if I'll ever get to see that next issue.
[electronic beeping]
[man] EB-9 to MR-1.

[rumbling]
[thud]
[exhales deeply]
Well, shall we go out and claim the planet in the name of Brooklyn?
Not yet, Sam.
Open the viewports, Tom.
Okay-
Turn on the outside mic, Sam.
Yes, sir.
[Tom] Strange.
Nothing moves.
Everything seems to be... waiting.
Shoot anything that moves and pick up anything that doesn't.
I'm gonna take that advice, especially on the first count.
Turn up the volume, Sam.
[low droning sound]
Well, come on, Iris.
Let's get to work on our tests, huh?
You take the microbe count and radiation.
I'll work on the atmospheric composition, temperature.
Keep a sharp lookout, Sammy.
Anything moves, yell.
You know, it's so quiet out there, if anything does move,
I'm gonna jump right out of my skin.
Something will.
With all that vegetation out there, there's bound to be something alive.
You mean, like five-armed Ongolurs?
What?
[chuckling]
Don't worry, Sammy.
We O'Bannions are charmed.
Yeah, but maybe us Jacobs ain't?
My dad, when I was a kid, told me about my grandfather.
He had sort of a sixth sense, particularly in Indian country.
When there were Indians around, his ears would begin to twitch.
Runs in the family.
Oh, well, I am reassured,
Colonel, sir.
Only, do me a small favor, will ya?
If your ears start to twitch, will you let me know fast?
I'll twitch with you.
- Anything move yet, Sam?
- Not a thing.
[loud crash]
Stay here.
Hey!
I told you not to leave that thing layin' around.
Iris tripped over it.
She dropped a tray of test tubes.
- Boy, I'm sorry, Colonel.
- Aw, that's all right, Sammy.
No surprises, Tom.
The atmosphere is pretty much like we thought: thin, extremely thin.
Not enough oxygen to sustain us, but undoubtedly enough for some kind of native animal life.
Well, like you said, Professor, no surprises.
[chuckles]
You seen anything yet, Sam?
Just those frozen vegetables.
Any sounds?
Not a peep.
If those Martians are out there, they must be invisible.
No movement at all.
"Weirdsville," as my grandmother used to say.
Keep your eyes open, huh?
Yes, sir.
We've landed near the Equatorial belt.
Now, if there is any native intelligence around here, it should be in this area.
I think you must be right.
Sorry about the sound effects.
Aw, forget it, Irish.
This crazy silence and lack of movement's gotten us all.
It doesn't make any sense, Sammy.
Something has got to move.
- What's the matter? Ears twitch?
- Aw, just a hunch.
Yeah? What?
I know there's something out there.
Sure, like the invisible
Martian?
Are you certain the outside mics are on, Sam?
Full volume.
You know, the atmosphere is very rare.
It wouldn't conduct sound too well.
Of course.
That might also explain why the plants don't move.
No breeze.
I wonder...
Could it be... intentional?
Intentional?
I know it sounds unreasonable, but it just doesn't seem natural.
You mean, you think it's controlled?
What beings could possibly exercise such fantastic control?
Well, there's one way to find out. I'm going out there.
- Tom, wait, I don't--
- No, no, we'll all go.
It's about time Iris and I had a chance to use some of this expensive lab equipment of ours.
All right. Get your suits.
You know something, Professor?
First time in my life
I've ever really been scared.
There's nothin' out there except a bunch of crazy plants.
It takes a brave man to admit his fears, Sam.
We're all afraid of the unknown.
Yeah.
Yeah.
- You okay, Irish?
- Mm-hmm.
I'm actually looking forward to start to work.
You know,
I can't say that I recommend space suits for beautiful young dolls.
What happened to all your lovely curves?
No, Sammy.
Some of the creations I've seen in New York store windows didn't look too much better.
I'm convinced that all fashion designers are woman-haters.
[screams]
Dr. Ryan, what is it?
What happened?
I don't know.
I can't remember.
All I know is it was horrible.
All right, all right.
You rest now, and we'll talk to you later.
Nurse, sodium luminol, two and a half grains.
Yes, doctor. Intravenous?
Yes.
She's obviously had a tremendous shock.
She has a mental block.
Her mind refuses to remember something.
You noticed her memory is already beginning to take on a quality of unreality.
We must know what happened.
A man's life, perhaps more, depends on it.
I know. Suppose this alien infection spreads to all of us.
Every moment counts.
What about the tapes?
Any result?
We've gone through nearly all of them. Empty.
Dr. Ryan must remember.
What about narcosynthesis?
Well, it's our only hope.
But she's pretty weak.
She ought to get some rest before we use drugs.
Her mind might snap if we forced her to remember the horror she has so carefully obliterated from her conscious level.
Would she be able to remember what actually happened?
She'll be able to remember anything familiar normally.
Although, when we penetrate her mind block into her suppressed memories, her recall will be undoubtedly colored by her mind's own interpretation of what she experienced.
In effect, whenever she's remembering anything that was alien, frightening to her, we'll see it as her mind saw it.
Exactly.
And remember, her mind had to save itself by forgetting.
Dr. Gordon.
How is he?
Is he getting worse?
I'm afraid so.
We don't know what it is we're fighting, Iris.
And I'm the only one who can help you, by remembering.
There is a way you can force me to remember, isn't there?
There is.
Then use it.
Dr. Ryan, you've had quite an ordeal.
You need to build up your strength. You need rest.
The shock of forced memory recall under the influence of drugs can be dangerous for you.
And how long can he wait?
Please, Dr. Gordon.
Ah.
What is it, Irish?
The port outside.
Tom, it was horrible.
Stay with her, Sammy.
- There's nothing there, Irish.
- But I saw it!
What did you see?
It was like a huge, distorted face, with... with three bulging eyes.
But there's nothing there now.
I tell you, it was there!
Hey, three eyes!
What a crazy Peepin' Tom, huh?
It was staring right at me.
There's nothing moving.
There's nothing there.
You don't believe me, do you?
Hey, everybody.
With this waitin', it's a wonder
I didn't get to see the thing.
I did see it, Sam,
I really did.
Please, couldn't you just make believe you didn't?
I'd be much less scared.
If that thing is out there, we won't find out about it in here.
You're so right. Let's go out and take a look, Gettell.
Irish, you stay here with Sammy.
Not on your life,
Colonel O'Bannion!
I'm going, too!
Well, hey, wait for me!
[low droning sound]
Check your oxygen gauge-
Okay-
Now, this'll be S.O.P.
Even though these intercoms carry for miles,
I want you to always stay in sight of me.
Sam, your ultra-sonic freeze gun hooked up alright?
- Yes, sir.
- Why don't we check it?
That plant over there.
[high pitched beep]
[shattering sound]
All right, huh?
[Sam] Yeah!
Very all right. Wow!
The pickup mics are on, Tom.
I heard it shatter.
- What about you?
- Yes, it checks.
Loud and clear, four-by-four.
All right, let's go and see what's in that jungle.
Come on, Irish.
Wait a minute. I won't be long.
It's amazing.
Just let me make a preliminary examination.
If you ask me,
I think we oughta make a preliminary examination for Martians.
We can stay here for a while.
You cover that side and I'll stay here, Sammy.
Okay-
[Iris] Fantastic.
All the characteristics of plant life, but hardly any chlorophyll.
And there seem to be indications of... of a nervous system.
- Nervous system?
- Well, it looks like it.
Of course, I'll have to make some more specific tests.
What about the minerals?
I haven't found anything yet to contradict the theory that the basic matter throughout the universe is the same.
But, I have run across some most unusual chemical combinations.
These vines are almost like fingers.
Where are you going, Irish?
I'm tracing this vine.
I'm curious to see where it comes from.
- You'd better stick close to me.
- Oh, Tom, really!
I know you think I acted like an hysterical female at the ship.
I'm perfectly capable of taking care of myself.
I won't get out of your sight.
Have it your way, Irish.
Tom! Tom!
Tom!
[low growl sound]
Tom!
[low growl sound]
Tom!
Tom!
Tom!
[Tom shouts]
Now, Sam! Get it!
[low growl continues]
[high pitched beep]
[beep stops]
You all right, Irish?
I think so.
Just let me count to ten.
Count to 100 if you like.
I'm all right now.
Hey, what was that thing?
It's a giant carnivorous plant, Sam.
It feeds by trapping animals and digesting them, live.
Lotsa luck.
Here, come on, take a look.
If it weren't for you and Tom, that could've been me.
Well, at least we know there's animal life up here, huh?
Now he tells me.
It's remarkable.
You were right, Iris.
This is more than just a plant.
It's a low form of neuromuscular vegetal creature.
What do you say we call it a day and go back to the ship?
I agree.
We've had enough excitement and swashbuckling for one day, hmm?
I'm for that.
Any "swash" I ever had just came unbuckled.
Let's go.
I'm sure glad the boys in ordnance developed you, baby.
[kissing]
I think I'll call ya Cleopatra,
'cause you're such a cool doll.
[sighs] And believe me, Cleo, you and I will never part.
Never.
[Iris chuckles]
[Theodore chuckles]
Here, Sammy, for your scrap book.
Hey, what a handsome couple.
Look, Colonel, me and my new pinup.
[Tom] There must be other creatures around.
You better take care of that thing.
You never know what else we'll find.
Or what'll find us.
Oh well, chin up,
Sammy boy, Chin up.
You know, Sam, there's only a little bit of difference between keeping your chin up and sticking your neck out.
Colonel, sir,
I, for one, know it...
HOW.
Was that thing really trying to kill Iris?
It wasn't just a friendly embrace.
But why weren't we attacked before?
We all passed that... that plant creature.
What are you driving at,
Professor?
Well, I can't help feeling that we're being watched.
That there is some purpose behind it all.
What's the matter, Professor?
Your ears twitch, too?
Obviously, there is animal life here, probably intelligent life as well.
And yet, we haven't seen any.
Now, this quiet, this lack of motion...
Oh, you still think it's... intentional, controlled.
Well, I... I don't know.
But why?
Perhaps, in a way, we're being controlled, too, through the actions of these lower life forms, kept harmless, so to speak.
What could control all life here?
It could be some super-intelligent community mind, I suppose.
- Community mind?
- Yes.
Like the inexplicable, mysterious control which keeps a colony of ants functioning in perfect unity back on Earth.
I got news for you, Professor.
I'll take the ants any day.
Well, we have four days left to find out.
Isn't your Earth contact a little late, Sammy?
Yeah, it is.
Over an hour late.
- Try your equipment.
- [low droning sound]
It's not equipment failure.
I get nothin' but dead air.
Hmm.
Keep your line open and try transmitting.
[echoing] This is MR-1 and this is a test transmission.
It's no use. Our signal keeps bouncing back at us.
I can't get through.
There must be some ionized layer in the Martian atmosphere, keeping those radio waves from going through.
Yeah, and keeping Earth's reports from reaching us.
I never heard of anything that'd stop the frequencies I'm using.
Well, you're hearing about it now.
Keep taping our reports, Sammy.
We're going to stay here the full five days, even if it means no contact with Earth.
[thud]
Jumpy, Irish?
Afraid so, a little.
Hmm. See anything?
Nothing.
Everything seems to be dead out there.
It's like a nightmare of unending silence.
I know. We all feel it.
Then it isn't just me, because I'm a woman?
[chuckling] Oh.
Women don't have any monopoly on fear.
Men are more afraid of being called cowards.
Cowardice is one thing I guess we can never forgive ourselves.
Look, the sun's rising.
Yeah.
Looks sort of angry.
[Sam] All right, everybody, come and get it!
Breakfast's ready!
Hot coffee, hard tack and vitamin pills!
We'll head off in that direction.
Now, remember, stay together.
Come on, Irish.
This certainly looks different.
Look! Those trees over there!
They look different, too.
[Tom] Yeah, like nothing we've seen.
Let's take a closer look at them.
Okay. Sam and Gettell, you stay here.
Keep Cleo handy.
I'll go with you.
Doesn't look like bark.
Let me have your machete, Tom.
Here.
- [shrieking sound]
- Oh, it's alive!
Look out, Professor!
[high pitched beep]
[beep stops]
[high pitched beep]
- Look out, Professor!
- [screams]
Colonel!
I'm givin' her all she's got!
She won't move her!
Cleo isn't budging her!
Stay here.
[Tom] Aim for the eyes, Sam!
Blind it!
Get it!
[shrieking loudly]
- Are you all right?
- Yes, give me a moment.
Are you hurt?
[Theodore] No, no, Iris.
I'll be all right.
No bones broken.
Just bruised a bit.
Boy, some playmate.
King Kong's big brother.
Even Cleo only gave it a slight chill.
[Tom] Must be about 40 feet high.
Come on, let's get back to the ship.
Oh, no, no, no. Wait, Iris.
We don't have much time for exploring as it is.
We mustn't lose more of it on account of me.
It's too important.
I'll be fine.
I've been curious as to what's on the other side of that ridge.
Let's go.
Now there it is, a Martian lake.
It has that same feeling of deadness.
Yeah.
No, wait a minute, Iris.
[electrical clicking sound]
It's all right.
No abnormal radiation.
So there's water on Mars after all.
Besides the polar icecaps, I mean.
If it is water.
Well, it feels kind of oily.
Seems... seems heavier than ordinary water.
It probably has an entirely different mineral content.
I'm sure it couldn't sustain life, at least not life as we know it.
I wonder what's on the other side?
Well, tomorrow we'll bring the boat.
The lake isn't so wide.
We'll have a look.
It's getting late.
We meet any more creatures like that last one,
I'd hate to have to fight 'em in the dark.
Come on.
Some baby, that rat-bat-spider nightmare, huh?
Walked away from Cleo and even after Cleo turned on all her charms, too.
At least she scared it away.
Yeah, good girl, that Cleo, huh?
[kissing]
Hey, you know the only thing that bothers me?
Someday, maybe she'll meet a monster that'll ignore her, break her heart.
Mine, too.
Irish,
Sam, the Professor and I have come to a decision.
Yes, in view of everything, we've decided not to stay the full five days.
- Huh?
- We're gonna take off tonight.
- Tonight?
- Mm-hmm.
Sam, prepare the panel for take-off, will you?
- Yes, sir.
- But why?
Well, Iris, it's probably mostly because of me.
You see, I can't seem to get it out of my head that there is an even greater danger here than we realize.
The controlling force?
Yes.
My orders from
General Treegar were to take no unnecessary chances.
We've fulfilled our mission.
We've landed on Mars.
Mm-hm. And we've collected a lot of information, plenty to prepare for the next expedition.
Now prepare for blastoff.
Strap in.
Gettell, close the ports.
Right.
Instrument lights.
Minus 15 seconds. Mark!
Main firing switches, on.
Minus ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one, fire!
[rumbling sound]
[rumbling stops]
What is it, Tom?
We can save our fuel.
We're not going anywhere.
Look, every pin is glued to the top.
We're in some sort of a force field, tremendously powerful, holding us right here.
The control.
Whoever they are, they don't want us to leave.
Why don't they come out in the open, whoever they are?
This waiting, uncertainty, not knowing...
Why are they keeping us here?
What do they want with us?
What are we? Guinea pigs?
Take it easy, Irish, easy.
Now, think a minute.
They can't really want to harm us.
If they did, they could've destroyed us a long time ago.
They must have another reason for keeping us here.
Tom, I've run a few tests.
Now, we're being held by a gravitational pull so strong, it would take 100 times the thrust we have to break free.
I wonder. Will we ever get back to Earth again?
Well, we're not gonna wait.
Sam, break out the boat.
We'll see what's across that lake.
[air hissing]
Didn't we calculate that the other shore was just over the horizon?
We did.
Well, then, we should see it quite soon.
I don't like this place.
I'm with you.
Why?
It's so dead.
Well, it's better than that walkin' forest we just ran into.
Tom, take a look at this.
What do you make of it?
Now we're getting somewhere.
Those buildings didn't just grow. They were made.
Let's get closer.
Yeah, I want to get one of those Martian girls.
[Tom] We thought we had it made.
[Iris] How tall are those buildings?
[Tom] Why, at least half a mile, I'd say.
Oh, look at that!
Iris, Gettell, get back to the ship.
Sam, try Cleo again.
Yeah, right.
[high pitched beep]
Iris!
Close the door!
Hold it!
- [high pitched beep]
- [Sam screaming]
[gurgling sound]
Close the door.
Sam, he just...
Easy, Irish, easy, huh?
I'll open the view ports.
Look!
Try the screens.
It's all around us.
Tom, your arm.
Part of that creature touched you.
- Eaten right through the suit.
- Like... like Sam.
You'd better get out of that suit.
I'll get some niacin compound, just in case.
Give me that suit, Tom.
We'll put it in the disposal unit.
Iris... what is your opinion of that creature?
Well, I'm sure it's a unicellular animal.
Those two areas inside it must be the nucleus and the contractile vacuole.
Now, wait a minute. Whoa. Heh.
- Let me in on it, Irish, huh?
- It's like an amoeba, Tom.
A giant amoeba, one single cell, without intelligence, without a nervous system at all.
It reacts completely on instinct to external stimuli.
Ah, we must be safe in here.
The amoeba engulfs its prey and digests it with extremely strong acids.
[inhales and exhales deeply]
It's trying to get to us.
It's incredible.
I wouldn't say that, Tom.
Not after what we saw it do to poor Sam.
Yeah.
It'll take time, but it probably can eat right through the ship.
Well, we've got to get rid of it some way.
But how? It can't even be touched with anything we have.
You've experimented with amoeba on Earth. What affects them?
They're almost impossible to kill.
Even if you cut them in half, both parts will live.
Now, there's got to be some way to get at it.
It can encyst, Tom.
That is, secrete and form a sort of protective envelope.
That's how it withstood the sonic gun.
Heat, fire.
I could turn on the rocket.
You can't do that, Tom.
With that creature clogging our thrust chamber we'd have an internal explosion.
Well, we've got to do something!
I can't think of anything.
Hey, wait a minute.
I do remember.
We experimented with electricity.
[Tom] What happened?
Well, the power from a small flashlight battery killed thousands of amoeba.
That's it! Electric shock!
I can generate half a million volts.
But how are you going to get to it to electrocute it?
You can't go outside, or even open the airlock.
I won't have to.
But what I have in mind could backfire.
If you both don't agree,
I won't go through with it.
What is your plan, Tom?
I'll need your help.
Check me out.
This ship has a double hull, right?
That's correct. The outer hull acts as a meteor bumper.
And the outer hull is completely insulated from the inner one?
- Quite effectively.
- Good.
Now, is there any way I can get to the outer hull from in here?
One place only, the detector instrument cable access channel.
I want to feed the radar power through the outer hull.
Can it be done?
[Theodore] It would take a lot of rewiring, but, yes, we can do it.
What I have in mind: feed the current through the outer hull, without it spilling back into the inner one.
What do you think?
And if there is a spill?
Then we won't have to wait for that thing to eat through to us.
Well, I'm for it.
So am I.
Good. Let's go.
- Almost through.
- Mm-hm.
- Open the view plates.
- Mm-hm.
[whirring sound]
Well, that's it.
Cut in the generators.
[electronic sounds]
Go ahead, Tom.
[loud electronic sounds]
[electronic sounds stop]
Gettell.
- Gettell.
- What is it?
It's...
It's all right. I was j... it's all right.
Just a little pain, that's all.
The exertion, I suppose.
Aw, c'mon.
Take it easy, Professor.
I'll start rewiring it just in case whatever's holding us here decides to let us blast off in a few days.
- [beeping]
- The radio works.
The force field must be off.
Turn on the recorder, Irish.
[alien voice] Men of Earth, we of the planet Mars,
give you this warning.
Listen carefully and remember...
Professor Gettell!
Oh... Iris,
I'm sorry.
The... takeoff... the acceleration pressure...
Don't talk now.
- Let me help.
- No, no.
Wait, Iris.
The ship, the wiring...
You... you must try...
[groaning quietly]
Uh...
Tom... in the cabin...
The cabin...
[screams]
[electrical whirring]
[sobbing]
Tom!
Dr. Ryan, is that all of it?
What was the warning?
What else did the voice say?
Try to remember.
I don't know.
But Tom, he had me turn on the tape recorder.
Maybe the last tape...
Nurse, light, please.
Here you are, doctor.
- What is it?
- Exhaustion.
Will she be all right?
With a lot of rest.
A giant amoeba.
She told us what we had to know.
- About Tom?
- Yes.
It's an enzymatic infection.
A minute part of the amoebic creature must have reached Tom's skin.
And it's growing, literally eating his tissues.
Can you save him?
Now we know what we're fighting.
At least we have a chance.
[water splashing]
- [groaning]
- Dr. Gordon.
- All right now.
- [breathing rapidly]
Three CCs.
All right.
Call me immediately if there's any change.
Yes, doctor.
Dr. Gordon tells me it has resisted everything we've tried.
We have slowed down its growth, but that's all.
You know more about this creature than anyone.
- We thought that--
- General Treegar, there is a biological laboratory here, isn't there?
Yes, of course.
[indistinct whispering]
Fine.
Dr. Ryan, Dr. Ryan!
Dr. Gordon, I think we found the solution.
What can we do?
I'll show you.
Electricity.
We have already thought of that, Dr. Ryan.
But any kind of electric shock strong enough to kill the amoeba will also kill Tom.
- I know.
- Then how?
We've been attacking the alien amoeba as if it were a disease, but it isn't, it's an animal, an animal with instincts, and most important of all, a will to act.
It only makes it harder to destroy.
And gives it a vulnerability we also have, that of making a wrong choice.
Look. We have two identical tissue cultures there.
Both infested with our own microscopic amoeba and placed very close to each other.
One we left alone.
The other we subjected to light, periodic electric shocks.
Before long, all the amoeba on the irritated culture had made their choice.
They moved to the nearby undisturbed culture.
Then that is what we have to do.
We will prepare a large tissue culture and place it next to the infected arm, then, subject Tom to electric shocks, just short of being harmful to him.
Better hurry and get out of that bed, Colonel, sir.
Broadway's waiting.
[Tom] Broadway?
Just like to know if I can cash my rain check?
It's up to you, Iris.
[door opens]
Tom, Iris, I have something
I want you to hear.
You were right.
The whole speech was on the recorder, the last tape.
I think you should listen to it.
Sounds important.
Judge for yourself.
Professor Weiner.
[alien voice] Men of Earth, we of the planet Mars
give you this warning.
Listen carefully and remember.
We have known your planet Earth
since the first creature crawled out of the primeval slime
of your seas to become man.
For millennia, we have followed your progress.
For centuries, we have watched you,
listened to your radio signals
and learned your speech and your culture.
And now, you have invaded our home.
Technological adults, but spiritual and emotional infants.
We kept you here, deciding your fate.
Had the lower forms of life on our planet destroyed you,
we would not have interfered.
But you survived.
Your civilization has not progressed beyond destruction,
war and violence against yourselves and others.
Do as you will to your own and to your planet,
but remember this warning:
do not return to Mars.
You will be permitted to leave for this sole purpose:
carry the warning to Earth.
Do not come here.
We can and will destroy you, all life on your planet,
if you do not heed us.
You have seen us, been permitted to glimpse our world.
Go now.
Warn mankind not to return unbidden.

[ Man Narrating ]
This is Tokyo...
once a city of six million people.
What has happened here
was caused by a force...
which, up until a few days ago,
was entirely...
beyond the scope
of man's imagination.
Tokyo - a smoldering memorial
to the unknown...
an unknown which,
at this very moment, still prevails...
and could at any time lash out
with its terrible destruction...
anywhere else in the world.
There were once many people here
who could have told of what they saw.
Now there are only a few.
My name is Steve Martin.
I'm a foreign correspondent
for United World News.
I was headed
for an assignment in Cairo...
when I stopped off in Tokyo
for a social call.
But it turned out to be a visit
to the living hell of another world.
Emergency hospitals were overflowing
with the maimed and the dead.
For the living,
the horror of last night was over.
The only thought left
was the paralyzing fear...
that it could happen again today...
or tomorrow.
[ Geiger Counter Clicking ]
Everyone who had survived
without serious injury...
was helping to repair
the human wreckage.
One of the survivors
was Emiko Yamane...
the daughter of Japan's
famous paleontologist.
For some of the victims,
there was hope.
For others,
there would be no tomorrow.
[ Child Wailing ]
I don't know
how many hours went by...
before an auxiliary
hospital unit found me.
I knew it was daylight.
I was surprised to be alive.
The odor of scorched flesh
permeated the air.
The sight of all the helpless
human wreckage...
snapped me back to stark reality.
[ Wailing Continues ]
[ Woman Sobbing ]
Emiko. Emiko!
Steve. Steve Martin.
Are you badly hurt?
After last night,
I'm lucky to be alive.
I guess we're all living on borrowed time.
Oh, Steve, what brought this upon us?
I don't know, Emiko.
I don't know.
Your father - is he all right?
Yes. He's meeting with the security officials now.
[ Groans ]
Don't move, Steve.
I'll try to get a doctor for you.
[ Steve Narrating ]
It was still hard for me to believe...
that I could be lying here
in a hospital alive....
when I think of the thousands
of others dead and dying...
in the ruins around me.
When I think back,
only a few days ago...
I was en route to Cairo...
with a few days' layover in Tokyo.
I was looking forward to a visit
with an old college friend, Dr. Serizawa...
a theoretical scientist who was gaining
great recognition in the Far East...
for his unusual experiments.
While I was unaware
of it at the time...
10,000 feet below,
an incident was about to take place...
that would shake the foundations
of the civilized world. dd [ Ballad ]

DISTRESS FREQUENCY
[ Steve Narrating ] This morning,
it would have been impossible...
for anyone to convince me that I would
ever see Tokyo like this again.
- Pardon. You are Mr. Steve Martin?
- Yes.
I'm Shigeo Ioto, assistant to Dr. Serizawa.
Oh, how do you do?
And how is Serizawa?
His health is fine, but he regrets not being here to meet you.
Something wrong?
Dr. Serizawa had to go inland on some field experiments.
He wanted to delay them until after your visit... but they were much too important.
- He hopes that you understand.
- Of course.
- Oh, when's he planning to return?
- Perhaps before your departure to Cairo.
Meanwhile, if there's anything I can do, please feel free to call me.
I certainly will.
[ Japanese ]
[ Japanese ]
I'm sorry, Mr. Martin, but we must ask you... to come to the security office for questioning.
Is this a polite way of telling me I'm under arrest?
No, no arrest.
Just questioning.
- But it is imperative that you come.
- Of course.
I'll take your bag.
Hotel Mikasu?
No. Still the Imperial.
[ Man Over P.A. ]
Flight 104 is arriving at ramp seven.
[ Japanese ]
- How do you do, Mr. Martin?
- Mr. Iwanaga.
During your flight last night, did anything unusual occur?
Well, I didn't notice anything.
I was busy writing and reading, and the rest of the time I was sleeping.
Oh, I see.
I understand you've questioned everyone on my flight.
What is it you're trying to find out?
I represent United World News.
I don't know, Mr. Martin.
I don't know whether it should be printed or not.
I don't follow you.
You see, we don't know what it is we're dealing with.
At 3:30 this morning, a ship from Tokyo was literally wiped... from the surface of the ocean in a matter of seconds.
Anything from the ship's radio?
It said there was a blinding flash of light... and the ocean burst into flame.
Could have been a mine or a collision.
Why would the radio men not report a mine or a collision?
That's a good point.
Well, whatever's being done
I'd like to find out about.
All right.
Come with me.

You mind telling me what they're discussing?
They're at a loss to explain how their ship could disappear so suddenly.

- Any survivors?
- No, not yet.
They're in direct contact with the rescue ship now.
It should arrive at the scene of the sinking in a few hours.

The few survivors who had been found...
died in a matter of minutes

With disaster following disaster,
the terror-stricken people...
demanded action be taken.
Security officials and scientists
were called together.
Dr. Yamane,
Japan's leading paleontologist...
was among the top scientists
invited to the meeting.
I had met Dr. Yamane through my friend
Serizawa several years ago.
If there was to be an answer
to these mysterious ship disasters...
it would come from these men.
[ Japanese ]
[ Man Speaking Japanese ]
[ Japanese ]
I'm afraid my Japanese is a little rusty.
[ Japanese ]
Dr. Yamane is suggesting to the officials... that they question the natives of a small island.
He says that Odo Island is close to the area... where the disasters have taken place.
[ Steve Narrating ]
Odo Island...
a bleak spot of land in the Pacific...
populated
with several hundred natives...
who were now
half paralyzed with fear.

who had seen
some of the fires at sea.

a helicopter was dispatched from Tokyo.

the group of officials who were
to question the natives of Odo Island.
While various natives
of the island...
were being interrogated
by the officials...
Tomo and I went out
among the natives.
[ Japanese ]
Hey, Tomo, we make him mad?
He's frightened.
He's terribly frightened.
He must've seen something.
He claimed he saw a monster, a horrible monster.
If he saw a monster, he's had too much sake.
No, no, Mr. Martin.
These island people are very superstitious.
Well, let's see what else we can find out.
[ Steve Narrating ]
It was decided that we'd spend the night...
and it gave me an opportunity
to witness a rare ceremony...
one that was all but forgotten.
dd [ Native ]
The island people are beset by many dangers, Steve - some real, some imagined.
This ceremony is dedicated
to one such danger.
There's a legend
among the island people...
that somewhere off their shores
there exists a monster... too terrible for a mortal to conceive.
Many centuries ago, they used to send a young girl out on a raft... each year as a sacrifice.
dd [ Continues ]
What's the name of this monster?

Godzilla. Godzilla!

They said it was Godzilla.
The next morning, the officials brought
some of the islanders back to Tokyo...
to make a direct report.
[ Chattering In Japanese ]
[ Japanese ]
Each of the natives of Odo Island...
told his own story
of the sudden turbulence...
and had his own ideas
of its cause.
They were all of the opinion
that the destruction was brought about...
by a living creature.
[ Japanese Continues ]
[ Japanese ]
I have not been to the island myself... but the world today is filled with many mysteries.
In the Himalayas, footprints of snowmen have been found.
No one knows
anything about them...
so there's no one
who can explain
a phenomenon
at the top of the world.
Is it not possible that some other
unexplainable phenomenon....
might exist at the bottom
of the ocean?
A research party should be organized to make... a scientific survey of Odo Island.
[ People Applauding ]
I'm going to catch Dr. Yamane.
I'll see you later.
It seems to me there are still forces left in this world... that none of us can understand.
[ Japanese ]
Oh, excuse me.
[ People Chattering ]
- Dr. Yamane.
- Steve Martin. It is good to see you.
You take this monster talk seriously?
Who can tell?
I understand you're heading the research group to Odo Island.
Yes. We leave this afternoon.
With your permission, I'd like to come.
I've been cleared by the security office.
Of course. Pier J at 2:00.
Good. I'll see you then.

But there was still
a feeling of anxiety among us all...
for every ship
that had taken this course...
had vanished
from the face of the earth.
Yes, there was a feeling of anxiety.
But perhaps the two exceptions...
were Emiko and a young
marine officer named Ogata.
At the moment, they seemed
more interested in each other.
When I'd last seen Emiko...
she had just become engaged
to Dr. Serizawa.
It was the usual triangle...
only this time it was
to play an important part...
in the lives of millions of people.

Look at the size of those footprints!
It can safely be assumed that two million years ago...
It can safely be assumed that two million years ago... this brontosaurus and other ancient reptiles roamed the earth.
It was known as the Jurassic age.
During this period,
there was another species which
we may call the intermediary animal...
a cross between the land-living
and the sea-living animals.
Let us call this creature Godzilla...
according to the legend
of Odo Island.
And judging from this photograph... this creature is over 400 feet tall.
[ All Murmuring ]
[ Man Exclaiming In Japanese ]
Of course, the question we are...
asking ourselves is how this animal...
happened to reappear
after all these centuries...
and so near to the coast of Japan.
One answer could be that some rare phenomenon of nature... allowed this breed of the Jurassic age to reproduce itself...
and for a long span of time, it had
no reason to reappear to the world.
But now that analysis
of radioactivity...
of the creature's footprint...
shows the existence of strontium 90...
a product of the H-bomb...
it is my belief that Godzilla
was resurrected... due to the repeated experiments of H-bombs.

We want to know what's being done about this monster.
Well, here's your headline:
‘‘Security Decides to Use

Oh, that's fine.
But how can they use depth bombs against something they can't even see?
Same way they look for a submarine: sonar.

in an effort to stem
the oncoming terror.

[ Steve Narrating ]
The damage had been severe...
but fortunately confined
to the dock section of the city.
Godzilla was still in Tokyo Bay...
and there was every reason
to believe he would return...
unless some means
was found to stop him.
[ Japanese ]
Steve.
- Hey, Steve.
- Hi, Tomo.
- What did you run out of the meeting for?
- Got to get this story off to the paper.
- Anything happen after I left?
- Yes.
They're making one last big effort to stop him.
- And what's that?
- Come here. I'll show you.
Tokyo is surrounded
by high-tension electrical towers.
To get to the heart of the city...
Godzilla would have to break through
300,000 volts of electricity.
The officials are trying to have everything ready by nightfall.
Now I must report back to my station.
All right.
And thanks, Tomo.
- So long, Steve.
- Sayonara.
[ Steve Narrating ] The security officials
ordered a general evacuation...

George, here in Tokyo, time has been turned back two million years.
This is my report as it happens.
A prehistoric monster the Japanese call Godzilla... has just walked out of Tokyo Bay.
He's as tall as a 30-story building.
And now he's making his way toward the city's main line of defense:
300,000 volts of electricity
strung around the city as a barrier...
a barrier against Godzilla.

Hi, Emiko.
You've been sleeping very nervously.
- Hello, Ogata.
- Hello, Steve.
Anything new develop?
[ Emiko ]
Nothing new will develop unless -
- [ Ogata ] Unless what?
- I was shown a terrible secret... which is probably the only weapon which could destroy Godzilla.
- What is it?
- I promised Dr. Serizawa...
never to reveal his secret to anyone.
Emiko...
Emiko, last night
Tokyo was destroyed.
Tomorrow it might be
Osaka or Yokohama.
If you can help, you must.
[ Emiko ]
When I went to see Dr. Serizawa...
I had intended to tell him about Ogata and me...
but there was something
he wanted to show me first.
[ Japanese ]
[ Screams ]
[ Emiko ] Dr. Serizawa had been
experimenting with oxygen...
when he came upon
a terrible chemical discovery -
a way to destroy
all oxygen in water...
thereby disintegrating
all living matter.
An amount no larger
than a baseball...
could turn Tokyo Bay
into a graveyard.
Serizawa had found
a terrible destructive power...
and until he could find
a counteracting good...
that would come
from this discovery...
he didn't want the world
to know his secret.
[ Japanese ]
[ Liquid Bubbling ]
He made me promise
never to tell what I had seen.
[ Ogata ]
Emiko, we need Serizawa's help.
There's no other way.
If I could only see him... just talk to him.
Perhaps I can change his mind.
Ogata will go with me.
Whatever you do, Emiko, you mustn't fail.
[ Ogata ]
Serizawa-san.
Sit down.
Doctor, I know of your Oxygen Destroyer.
- We must have it.
- I don't know what you are talking about!
I broke my promise, Serizawa.
I told Steve Martin and Ogata.
They both agree.
You must use your Oxygen Destroyer against Godzilla. [ Sobbing ]
- No.
- [ Ogata ] Serizawa-san!
Serizawa-san!
- Ah, Serizawa-san!
- Let go!
- We must have the formula! We must!
- Let go!
Please stop!

Sorry, Ogata.
The Oxygen Destroyer cannot be used.
If we don't defend ourselves from Godzilla now...
what will become of us?
And what will become of us if a weapon such as I now have...
falls into the wrong hands?
Then you have a responsibility no man has ever faced.
You have your fear,
which might become reality... and you have Godzilla, which is reality.

[Man Narrating]
It cost Commander Robert Reary...
20 years of unremitting
hardship and misery...
to reach the North Role
finally in 1909.
It would have astounded Reary to learn
that by the late 1 950s and early '60s...
the vast, frozen
top of the world he pioneered...
had become a vital highway
for world travel and commerce.
Not just in the skies...
but also deep under the ice...
in the frigid five-million-square-mile
depths of the Arctic Ocean.
Here, great passenger-and cargo-carrying
atomic submarines...
glided by the dozens
back and forth across the Role...
until a series of
mysterious undersea disasters...
threatened to close
the Arctic route forever.
The decisive moment came
May 3 at 13 15 hours...
when the undersea atomic liner,
Sturgeon, largest of them all...
reached 87 degrees, 10 minutes
north latitude...
only a few miles
from the North Role itself.
[Electricity Crackling]
[Narrator]
According to the official reports...
the next phase
of the life-and-death drama...
occurred May 1 0 in Washington...
at a hush-hush supersecret meeting...
of the Arctic theater war room.
Gentlemen, this is the man we've been waiting for.
The skipper of the atom killer sub, Tiger Shark.
Commander Dan Wendover.
This is Justin Murdock, secretary of defense.
- Mr. Murdock.
- Commander.
And I know you've heard a lot of Dr. Clifford Kent, Dan.
- Doctor.
- Commander.
Dr. Kent had a lot to do
with the development and design of your boat.
Sir Ian Hunt just flew in from London.
The Dr. Hunt, winner of the Nobel Prize for oceanography?
Oh, let's just say I took the bow for a team of very brilliant associates.
Uh, sit down.
Gentlemen, to begin, let me read you just one line... from a detailed staff study prepared for theJoint Chiefs.
''In our judgment, these Arctic disasters... may prove the gravest emergency in all history.''
Any comments on that statement?
A bit fanciful, isn't it, sir?
Possibly.
Let me read you, uh, a partial list of observed phenomena.
''Destruction of four surface vessels.
Largest, 1 0,000 tons.
''Radioactivity in Arctic waters,
flow ice and bergs.
''Reculiar television images
preceding each distress call.
''Seven polar atom subs...
vanished without a trace. ''
''Fanciful,'' did you say, uh, Sir Ian?
[Chuckles]
And now, Dan, we come to you.
You skipper the Tiger Shark...
the most advanced,
the deadliest killer sub in the fleet.
Right now she's undergoing emergency around-the-clock modification... in the Bremerton Navy Yard.
The orders call for special observation and testing instruments here...
removal of all but two atomic torpedoes... special launching equipment for water-to-air ballistic missiles... and a special escape hatch in the keel for the Lungfish.
The Lungfish?
Yes. Uh, a deep exploration device, sort of an animated diving bell.
The mission of the Tiger Shark... is to hunt down and identify the cause of these Arctic disasters.
If humanly possible... you will remove it.
[Man] Not that I don't think
Lieutenant Commander Holloway... is the finest exec in the entire sub fleet,Julie... and not that he isn't the best friend that I have -
Come on, Dave.
You talk too much.
Now be quiet, little mother.
I - I feel behooved to warn you... our friend Reef is no less than the number one howl in the entire sub wolf pack.
Nuclear powered.
And when it comes to women- Well... he has got a built-in sonar detector that -
Dave, you know you're exaggerating, old buddy-buddy. You know it. Yes, you are.
You know, on most boats, a certain loyalty exists...
between the exec
and his navigation and firing officer... but in the case of Lieutenant David Milburn of the Tiger Shark and myself-
But su - She's a nice girl.
Uh, I've seen you work.
I think she deserves a fighting chance.
Helen, I appeal to you.
Dave, look at me.
I'm the mother of your three children.
Will you please take me home to them at once?
There you are.
Just drop in anytime.
Don't bother to call.Just -Just drop in.
That's my way of life.
[Sighs]
Dave is exaggerating, you know.
I mean, a man spends three months in a deep freeze... it'll take his whole leave just to thaw him out.
By that time, he's ready to report back.
It won't take me long to defrost.
Not around you.
What was I saying about thawing out icebergs?
Yeah, you, uh -
You never can tell about icebergs.
Only show one-ninth above water.
After that kiss,
I'd say that's about right.
- Do you feel anything?
- Are you kidding?
No, I mean that this is just the beginning of something.
That we didn't just meet accidentally.
Oh, that's original.
Doesn't the next chorus go something like...
''Let's not waste one precious golden moment.
Any second there could be a knock on the door and -''
Well, I've seen stranger things happen.
It happens all the time to heroes on television, plays, motion pictures.
The hero gets his leave canceled, and he's -
And she spends the rest of her life wishing that she'd -
Oh, honey.
Let's not waste one precious moment then.
[Knocking On Door]
What's that pounding?
Need I say more?
Mmm.
Reef, look.
- Oh, no.
- What's wrong?
What is it?
Oh, no.
[Dave]
Reef.
- They caught you too, huh?
- At the worst possible moment.
Tomorrow's Janie's birthday.
Poor little kid's been looking forward two whole months to having her daddy home.
- Now -
- That's the worst possible moment?
What could be worse than disappointing a little girl?
Disappointing a big girl.
Julie?
[Laughing]
Really tough, old buddy.
[Laughing]
Oh, really tough.
[Laughing]
Skipper, I thought you were going to Washington.
I did.Just got back. Reef, I want you to meet a couple of our passengers.
Sir Ian Hunt and Dr. Clifford Kent.
My exec, Commander Richard Holloway.
- Glad to know you, sir.
- How do you do?
- Dr. Kent. Met you before.
- Yes indeed, Commander.
You gentlemen are going with us.
What for?
We'll discuss that later. Roberts.
- Have Chief Griffin report to me as soon as the crew's aboard.
- Yes, sir.
- Watkins.
- Yes, sir.
- Will you show these gentlemen to their quarters?
- Aye, aye, sir. This way.
Well. Sorry we had to cut your leave short.
- Yeah.
- Come at the wrong time?
Yeah.
Will do.
- Oh, it's you.
- Yeah.
Griff, what's the scoop? Hauled out in the middle of the night, all leaves canceled.
We going to war, or what?
Don't you worry, Chester. When the skipper wants you to know what's going on, he'll tell ya. Okay?
- I don't like it. I mean, this is all mighty funny.
- Ah, isn't it, though?
Suppose you get aboard anyway.
- I don't like it.
- What did you say?
I like it. I like it.
Hey.
Well, skipper, I think I'll stow my gear.
- Well, Reef, I got some bad news for ya.
- Oh, yeah?
- You're gonna have to share quarters this trip.
- Who with?
- Dr. Neilsen.
- Dr. Neilsen? When did that happen?
- Huh?
- Oh, it's all right. We're old friends.
Dave, stand by to shove off as soon as Griff reports the crew aboard.
Right, skipper.
Well, looks like we're gonna share quarters, skipper.
Been a long -
Carl.
You?
Oh, of course. I should have suspected when I heard that ''doctor.''
- I thought it was your father.
- It was supposed to be.
- Dad had a heart attack two days ago.
- He what?
It was mild. He'll be all right.
But it was out of the question his coming along.
And they thought you could replace the skipper, huh?
There was no choice.
Dad and I developed the Lungfish together.
Except for him,
I'm the only one qualified to dive in it.
- You could have trained somebody else.
- Not in two days.
Look, do you think I wanted to come?
If it didn't mean so much to Dad, proving his depth explorer, I certainly wouldn't be here.
That I can believe.
[Narrator] The Tiger Shark left
her dock at Bremerton at 0335 hours...
the morning of May 1 1...
on what was to prove the strangest,
most fearful voyage ever made by a submarine...
atomic or otherwise.
Simultaneously with
the Shark's departure...
and with his crew still in the dark
concerning their secret, fateful mission...
Skipper Wendover made
the first notation in the log.
The men would remain unbriefed
for two hours...
until the Tiger Shark
cleared Ruget Sound...
and was headed for open sea.
Who the devil belongs to this gear?
[Man]
Uh, we do, Chief.
Oh. You two guys, huh?
And just what do you do around here?
Underwater demolition.
Seaman First Class Powell, and I'm Carney.
Yeah, I know.
So you're frogmen.
Yeah, we're off tin cans.
We've, uh, looked the pigboat over from, uh, fore to aft... but can't seem to find an empty locker, uh, to store our stuff in.
An empty locker?
In a sub?
Are you kiddin'?
This whole deal is makin' less and less sense to me.
What are frogmen
doin'aboard the Tiger Shark?
Following orders, like everyone else in the navy.
Beats me.
But orders are orders.
Yeah, well, uh, in the meantime, where do you want us to stash these gizmos?
Come on.
[Narrator]
Shortly before dawn...
the Tiger Shark, running submerged
at better than 30 knots...
had left the sound behind...
and was headed for open sea.
Here are our orders, Reef.
Look 'em over while I fill in the crew.
Now hear this.
This is the captain speaking.
I know you're wondering about all the mystery.
[Wendover On P.A.]
Well, our job had to be kept absolutely secret.
Our mission is to find out what caused the disasters under the Arctic ice.
Once we cross the Arctic Circle,
any command you hear will be the real thing.
Rlease remember it.
That's about it.
Now you know as much as I or anybody else does, for that matter.
Oh, incidentally,
I assured Washington... that this was the best sub crew in the fleet.
I know you won't make a liar out of me.
Carry on.
That's it.
What do you think?
I think I should have joined the air force.
[Narrator] A week later, the Tiger Shark
was still running due north at cruising speed.
So far, the voyage was routine, uneventful.
But the nearer they came
to the Arctic Circle...
the more the tension increased...
the more tiny irritations
were magnified into bitter feuds...
the more the crewmen pondered
their possible fate.
On the morning of May 20...
the Tiger Shark crossed the Arctic Circle
into the critical area.
You're always asking me why I stay a bachelor.
There goes one of the best reasons
I can think of.
- Huh?
- Yeah. I might have a son like that.
I don't get it.
What goes with you two?
I guess his father, Skipper Neilsen, retired before you enrolled at the academy, didn't he?
I guess.
One of the finest men and officers alive.
A real hero in the best sense of the word.
World War II.
Taught engineering and design at the academy.
- Fought like a demon for atomic subs.
- So?
So, when his only son dropped out of school, began making statements... all sounding like borrowed propaganda -
''Ban the atomic test.''
''Junk the nuclear subs.''
''Spend the military budget for peace.''
Well, it just about broke the old man's heart.
Then when the newspapers picked it up... called Carl the honest, sincere son of a warmongering father... well, Captain Neilsen resigned from the navy.
Oh, he still keeps his hand in with projects like the Lungfish... but it broke him all the same.
Have, uh - Have you talked to Carl?
Tried to get his side?
His side?
He's all front with no back.
How can he have a side?
Either of you men seen Dr. Neilsen?
He's in here, sir.
Oh, uh, Tuttle, Powell, would you men mind leaving us alone for a few minutes?
Sure, Mr. Holloway.
Dr. Neilsen.
What is it?
You are out.
This came for you.
- My father?
- Dead?
No. As a matter of fact, he's a lot better.
Just got out of the hospital.
- What did you mean I'm out?
- Your father can be in Nome, Alaska tomorrow.
We have two choices.
We can ask them to bring him out by helicopter and take you off... or we can put the Shark back into Nome.
You trade school boys are all alike, aren't you?
Anybody who doesn't think like a little gold-braided puppet is ipso facto a coward.
You said it. I didn't.
Well, wearing a uniform doesn't bestow an automatic monopoly on courage, Commander.
It just so happens I'm not a coward - physical or mental.
And before I'd risk my father's life -
- We're all risking our lives.
- That may be... but Dad stays where he is, and I'm staying here.
Oh, you are a mixed-up oddball, aren't you?
Well, perhaps.
But the idea of willingly going to school... to spend my life at a Paleozoic pastime that should have disappeared with the thunder lizards -
I'm referring to war- that strikes me as the worst cowardice of all - being spiritually yellow.
- You mean nothing's worth fighting for?
- Peace.
The dignity of man, destiny of human spirit.
Now, you show me a man who says you win these fighting wars, and I'll show you an idiot.
Oh, Carl, you talk like so many young men I've - I've known.
You talk well.
Literately, intelligently- even brilliantly sometimes.
But you're all talk.
What do you do about your ideas... your ideals?
You mentioned my uniform.
These are my work clothes.
They represent what I'm willing to do... how hard I'm willing to work for what I believe in.
I doubt your willingness for anything... except talk about what you're against.
That talk darn near killed your father.
[Loud Bang]
- [Man On R.A.]
Mr. Holloway to the conn, please.
- [Alarm Blaring]
[Dave] The instruments have all gone crazy,
and take a look at the screen.
Incredible. Absolutely incredible.
- What hit us?
- It doesn't seem possible... but could it be an electric storm center?
Underwater?
[Dr. Kent] High-intensity arcs
will burn submerged...
and millions of volts discharged
in random directions.
Is there any way out of this?
Seems all around.
What about down?
- I don't know.
- Take her down.
- Maximum angle, maximum depth.
- Aye, aye, sir.
Take her down.
Maximum angle, maximum depth.
Sir Ian has evolved a theory.
At first I wasn't about to buy it... but we have eliminated one by one every other logical explanation.
Mmm. It is rather fantastic.
But, uh... here... is a chart of the Arctic region.
On it I've plotted every instant of these peculiar phenomena... the sinkings, electrical storms... our own experiences.
Now, uh... here is where we encountered the electrical storm.
The Sturgeon was lost about here.
The others here, here... and here.
- Do you see it?
- See what?
The pattern. The pattern.
Each incident occurred almost precisely
1 ,000 statute miles from the Pole.
A line drawn through the points of occurrence... makes almost a complete circle around the Pole.
Which adds up to what, Sir Ian?
I cannot accept the idea that these phenomena were... either random or natural.
I believe they were motivated by... some sort of intelligence.
Do you mean that somebody is -
I didn't mean to imply a human intelligence.
Well, what on earth kind of intelligence is it, Sir Ian?
Oh, perhaps... it's not an intelligence on Earth.
Perhaps it's an intelligence from beyond the Earth.
What can we do about it, sir?
I've been thinking about that.
As you see, these occurrences were on this line... almost a perfect circle around the Pole.
However, there may be a significant break in that ring... here in the area of the Queen Victoria Sea near FranzJosef Land... north of Murmansk and Finland.
Supposing your theorizing is correct... then this could be the next danger point.
Yes. Yes.
But supposing we, uh, anticipated a little.
Supposing...
the Tiger Shark was
lurking there, waiting.
He could be right.
We'll chart our course right straight across the Pole and bring us here.
The Queen Victoria Sea.
[Narrator]
So, swiftly, implacably...
the Tiger Shark moved across
the top of the world...
toward a rendezvous with what?
We've been running due south along the 30th degree of longitude.
By my reckoning we should be about here, just short of our planned position.
- And that should be -
-Just about the critical point, if we're on the right track.
- Prepare to surface. Flank speed.
- Aye.
Prepare to surface.
Flank speed.
Mr. Milburn.
Quick, look at this.
Skipper, Reef!
Those chunks of ice are coming right at us. Dive! Dive!
Dive! Dive!
- Determine extent of damage.
- Aft to torpedo room, report.
This is Griff, Captain.
Moderate leak in overhead plates.
Damage to main driveshaft housing.
Forced to full stop.
- We're dead in the water.
- [Dave] Captain.
[Reef]
Whatever it is, it certainly can travel.
Course and speed.
Speed, about 22 knots.
Course, due north.
Directly toward the Pole.
- Are you two flounders about set?
- We're ready.
Now, try and remember, you're not going out to rehearse a water ballet.
- We need a damage report.
- I never should have volunteered.
If I had enough sense, I would have -
Hey, uh, look out for the sharks, huh?
A pure oval shape... with this cyclops-like eye, or turret, on top.
I'd estimate its diameter at, oh, 300 feet.
No discernible orifices.
The eye of Cyclops.
What did you say, Sir Ian?
Just musing about our one-eyed adversary... and the Homer legend.
The Cyclopes were the sons of heaven... who forged the thunderbolts thrown by Zeus.
Our own cyclops throws quite a thunderbolt itself.
I knew there was something familiar.
Take a look.
This picture was taken by
an amateur astronomer over New Mexico.
I've had it since I served on the Air Force Evaluation Board...
for U.F.O. Reports.
''Unidentified flying objects.''
Then this is a flying saucer.
That was the popular designation, yes.
Weren't all the sightings in the sky, not underwater?
This would explain why there were never any reports of landings.
It's quite possible that whoever or... whatever inhabits this craft... is not a land creature at all... but some form of marine life.
That would make our little green men actually little green fish.
Undersea flying saucers.
- Excuse me, skipper.
- Yeah, Griff?
All internal repairs completed, and frogmen report exterior damage minor.
- Good.
- Then we can get under way, huh?
- Right, sir.
- Dave, you plotted the course of Cyclops?
Then that's our course.
Where he goes, we go until we get him.
Or perhaps until he gets us.
[Narrator] So the Tiger Shark began
relentlessly stalking her space enemy.
Up to the Role,
back to the Arctic Circle, again and again.
A week, a fortnight, a month.
[Narrator] Never a glimpse of their enemy,
but there were reports.
New disasters,
new ships and lives lost.
Invariably, the Tiger Shark
made for the scene...
only to arrive after Cyclops had left.
For all its desperation,
the pursuit seemed fruitless.
And then on July 3,
Dr. Kent and Sir Ian...
held an urgent discussion
with Reef and the skipper.
Why does Cyclops invariably turn to the Pole between attacks?
Never two in succession.
Always away and back, away and back.
We've asked ourselves that over and over a thousand times.
But answers are what we need, not more questions.
We think now we have them.
We took for granted his source of energy was nuclear.
But suppose it isn't at all.
What if it is magnetic?
Yes. Yes.
We harness energy on a small scale by cutting magnetic lines of force.
Supposing Cyclops does it on a superscale?
The North Pole is the positive end of the biggest magnet of all: the Earth itself.
What you're getting at is that you think our saucer friend... must return to the Pole regularly to recharge his batteries.
That may be oversimplifying it.
But, uh -
Now, uh, our present tactics are useless.
But suppose we place ourselves between Cyclops and the Pole.
In such a way as to prevent him returning to the Pole to... as you put it, recharge his batteries.
If we are lucky enough to catch him with his power depleted.
Then we polish him off with an atomic fish.
We wait till the next report of trouble, and then we lie in wait for him... right in his path, and bushwhack him.
- ''Bushwhack''?
- Yes, it's an American tactical expression.
Oh.
[Narrator]
So, a change of tactics.
Now the Tiger Shark cruised
almost over the North Role...
waiting for the radio report
that would put the plan into effect.
On July 1 3,
at 1 600 hours, it came.
- We got it, Reef.
- Cyclops?
Sounds like a distress signal from a small freighter between Ellesmere Island and Greenland.
- One Mayday, then nothing.
- Where's the skipper?
Already in the conn.
- [Dave] We're here.
-[Wendover] All right.
This is where Cyclops knocked off the freighter.
This is the way he has to head for home - the Pole.
Here we are, right in his path.
Sonar and TV-scan the bottom. Find a good place to hide and lie in wait for him... maybe a cave or a valley.
Rig for silent running.
As soon as we're on the bottom, secure everything that hums or buzzes.
- I want absolute silence.
- Very well.
Rig for silent running.
[Narrator] Hour upon hour,
the Tiger Shark lay in its deep-six ambush.
The Arctic depths were as still and silent
as an uninhabited world.
And then at 0600 hours -
[Clicking]
Skipper, Dr. Kent.
- What is it?
- That's him.
It has to be.
Range: 22 miles.
Speed: I give it 1 4 knots.
His radiation level is very low.
That would confirm our theory about having to return to the Pole.
It better be correct.
Get me a setup on the T.D.C.
Range: about seven miles.
Reef, arm atomic warheads. Load Tubes 1 and 2, and report to the conn.
- Sounds like we mean business.
- Yeah.
Griff, you arm number two.
I'll handle number one.
[Machinery Whirring, Beeping]
Load one and two.
Open outer doors.
Stand by for action.
Range: now 1 5 miles.
- You sure it's Cyclops?
- Take a look.
Range: 1 4.5 miles.
Griff to skipper.
Tubes 1 and 2 loaded.
Outer doors open.
Ready to fire.
Stand by.
[Beeping]
Range: eight miles.
Range: 7 3/ 4 miles.
Zero minus 1 0... nine, eight...
seven, six, five... four, three, two...
one, target zero.
Fire 1 .
- Number one, fired.
- Fire 2.
Number two, fired.
- How are they running?
- Hot, straight and normal.
Number one missed.
How could it? We're dead on the target with the homing first.
- What's that?
- A mass of jelly-like stuff came out of the thing and caught our torpedo.
It must function like a degaussing field.
We'll never get a torpedo through that.
Maybe not a torpedo.
Blow all main ballast tanks.
Reactor room, stand by.
As soon as we're off the bottom,
I want all ahead, flank.
-[Dave] What course, skipper?
- Right at our one-eyed friend.
- Right at him?
- That's what I said.
- But what can we accomplish?
- We can ram him.
You've weighed the consequences,
Captain, the lives involved?
Doctor, I've weighed the destruction that the Cyclops has done already... and what he'll do in the future unless we stop him right now.
- There must be some other means.
- What other means?
If the Tiger Shark can't stop him, no power on Earth can.
Now brace yourselves.
Sound the collision alarm.
[Siren Blaring]
[Rumbling]
We got him, skipper.
Drove right into him.
Look at that. Speared him like a fish.
We did it, boys.
Dove right through the saucer's side.
Reactor room, give me all reverse, full.
We're stuck tight.
Skipper, take a look at this depth gauge.
1 80 fathoms?
We can't be sinking that fast.
It's our screws, skipper. At our declination angle, running in reverse... they're pulling the shark and cyclops right to the bottom.
And we're at safe maximum depth already.
- Full stop.
- Full stop.
[Thuds]
[Narrator] Hours later, the two
titanic craft were still locked together...
in an apparent death grip...
on the bottom of the Arctic Ocean...
nearly 1 200 feet below the surface.
Well, anybody got any ideas?
Anything's better than lying here.
Suppose there's some kind of atmosphere inside the Cyclops.
What do you mean?
Well, maybe we could get inside the saucer. We could use our torches...
- to cut the Shark loose.
- That's all very well, young man.
How would one go about getting inside Cyclops?
Through the eye using the depth explorer.
Yes. The explorer was built to operate at even greater depths.
Yeah, but suppose there isn't any atmosphere inside the saucer.
Well, then the idea's no good.
But we're no worse off than we are now.
-[Dave] You've gotta let us try, skipper.
- Us?
Reef and I could take the explorer down, clamp it onto the eye -
[Neilsen]
No. You can't, but I can.
I can deliver you to the eye.
Then you -
A little out of your line, isn't it?
Why don't you stay aboard and make a speech?
Maybe you could get them to ban flying saucers.
Listen, Holloway. However our ideas disagree,
I've said before, I'm not a coward.
And it happens you have no choice.
Either I take you down there in the Lungfish...
- or you don't get there.
- I'd sooner swim.
- That's enough, both of you.
- Very well, sir.
No use making the odds any longer than they are.
It so happens that Dr. Neilsen's right.
Get the explorer in the air lock and prepare for launching.
- Better take Carney and Powell with you.
- The frogmen?
That's right. Their underwater experience might make them invaluable.
- You'll need sidearms.
- Sidearms? The saucer's dead.
- You hope.
- We better get ready.
Girls, you go everywhere I go.
All right, Carl.
There's still time.
- You wanna show me how?
- Get in.
[Griff On R.A.]
Ready to open air lock door, Captain.
Go ahead, Griff.
- What now?
- What do you say, Doctor?
- Shall we take a chance?
- That's what we came for.
You all stay here.
I'm gonna take a look inside.
Not alone, you're not.
Better breathe your oxygen, just in case.
- Air, pure air, under pressure.
- That's a relief.
Well, we won't need these tanks.
Good luck, men.
All right, let's go.
The bow drilled through her, but she sealed herself right up.
Yeah, there's our problem.
The sawteeth of the ram are caught in the break.
Now, if we can cut it away, the Shark can pull herself loose.
- I think you're right.
- Powell, go back to Dr. Neilsen.
Tell him to report to the skipper.
All right, let's get to work.
We read you, Doctor.
Go ahead.
They're inside the Cyclops.
It's full of breathable air.
- Wonderful.
- That's great, Doctor.
Reef thinks that he can clear the Shark's bow so we can pull ourselves loose.
What's it like inside the Cyclops?
This is a priceless opportunity to -
Doctor, tell Reef to make sure that you're in the clear before we make another move.
Right. Over.
- We may get out of this yet.
-Skipper.
- Could you take a look here?
- What's wrong, Griff?
The inertial navigation system must've been knocked out in the crash.
We're dead in the water, but it indicates we're moving.
- That's impossible.
- The radiation level from the saucer is rising.
What direction does the system indicate?
Due north at five knots.
No, six.
Toward the Pole.
But that Cyclops is dead.
We killed it, didn't we?
Beats me.
- Dave.
- Yeah?
Do you hear anything?
I don't hear anything.
You've been down here too long.
You better go topside and rest.
Strange you don't hear it.
- Reef.
- Huh?
You know something?
I think it's getting lighter in here.
Yeah. Yeah, it is.
If I didn't know better...
I'd swear we were moving.
Well, let's get back to work, and maybe we will be soon.
I'm getting an impression of movement,
Captain. Is that possible?
We get the same reaction up here.
Now they're feeling it down below.
The radiation level, constantly rising.
As we near the Pole.
There's got to be an explanation.
I think there is.
I believe our friend Cyclops is returning to life.
[Male Voice]
Commander Holloway, listen.
- Dave.
- Commander Holloway, make no resistance.
Did you hear it?
That sound again?
This time it was a voice.
It called my name.
Look, why don't you go topside?
[Voice]
You will see- that avails nothing.
Where do you think the sound was coming from?
Down there somewhere.
[Low-pitched Hum]
[Hum Continues]
[High-pitched Hum]
[Loud Hum]
Carney! Carney, help me!
CarneyI Help me, CarneyI Help meI
[Hum Increases]
CarneyI Carney, helpI
[Hum Continues]
[Grunting]
- [Cracking]
- [Gasping]
[Retching]
[Voice]
Remove your weapons, Commander.
And come here below.
- Come where?
- To me, here.
That voice again?
It wants me to go alone.
Oh, it does, does it?
You better stay here.
So, Commander Holloway, as you
Earth inhabitants would express it... we meet, face-to-face.
That's a face?
Roint of view is everything.
To us, your form of life is ugly... as we appear to you.
Tell me something.
Why is it that I can hear you and the others can't?
You do not hear me.
Our individual brain frequencies are now attuned...
and we exchange wave-thoughts.
You mean, extrasensory perception?
Whatever your Earth term may be... the principle is ancient and very simple.
It is not necessary for you to speak.
Your thought response will suffice.
My mission is to study various solar systems and planets.
Select the most suitable for colonization.
[Thinking]
For horrors like yourself?
Of course. It may interest you to know
I have visited hundreds of other worlds... and of all of them, your Earth seems most suitable.
[Thinking]
Swell.
[Creature]
Your friend was to remain where he was.
- [Thinking] He did.
-I am afraid not.
- Dave.
- What's going on in here, lad? What -
Stand away from him, Commander.
He wants you back.
So this is your headquarters.
Well, you've sunk your last ship, you -
[High-pitched Hum]
[Low Hum]
[Screaming]
[Thinking] Why not me?
What am I, the closing act?
On the contrary.
I want you unharmed, perfect.
[Thinking]
Why?
I have selected you to return with me... along with several other specimens for study.
We will examine you and the others...
discover desirable features
to incorporate in our Earth colonizers.
[Thinking]
And you just build them in, huh?
Of course.
Evolution is much too slow a process.
On Earth, you build with inanimate material.
We employ living tissue.
This space vehicle, for example.
It is a living thing.
When damaged-
you would say ''wounded''-
it immediately heals itself.
[Thinking] Oh, that's why no water leaked inside when we rammed you.
Of course. But it is time
to begin the return voyage.
[Thinking] To navigate, won't you have to see your way?
Obviously.
It'll be rough!
[Clicks]
[Clicks]
- Back to the Shark, right now.
- What about Dave and the others?
Fortunes of war.
Skipper, this is Reef from the depth explorer.
- Rull looseI
- Right, Reef.
Reactor room, get me all back.
Emergency.
- Well, what about the -
- Skipper, we didn't kill it.
And if that thing ever gets back to where it came from...
- the Earth is doomed and everybody on it.
- [Rumbling]
[Man On R.A.]
We've pulled loose, Captain. We're freeI
[Reef]
There it goes.
Headed straight for the Role, 50 knots.
Nothing we can do.
Excuse me, Captain.
There may be one last desperate chance.
What's that?
It's possible I could adapt one of the torpedo guidance systems to the I.C.B.M.... so it would home on the saucer when he rises from the Pole.
What about the time?
The Cyclops will have to linger at the Pole to recharge its power banks.
Well, it's worth a chance.
Reef, take over as navigator and see if you can find us an air hole in the ice.
- Let's go.
- Very well.
[Narrator] Adapt a complicated guidance
system to a huge ballistic rocket.
Convert it to a water-to-air
interceptor missile.
It was foolish.
It was insane. It was fantastic.
But it was their only hope...
and the Earth's only hope.
- Ready?
- As ready as we can be.
I'll report to the skipper.
Skipper...
we found our hole in the ice.
What's the corrected bearing to the magnetic pole?
3 57 degrees.
Prepare the I.C.B.M. for firing.
Well, that's about all we can do until our space friend decides to blast off.
Skipper, I think it's -
[Rumbling]
[Buzzing]
Fire! Fire!
[Explosion Continues]
Attention, all hands.
We got him.
Cigarette?
Ah, they're so remote, the stars.
-[Reef] Hmm.
- Cold and beautiful.
- Now I wonder.
- Yeah?
Which is the one?
The one we have to worry about?
Well, we have enough ills here to worry about.
But maybe,just maybe... when their ship doesn't return, they'll decide not to come here after all.
But if they do?
- Well.
- Oh, I wouldn't worry.
Knowing we have boats like the Tiger Shark... men like you, skipper...
Dave, Sir Ian, Kent, and my father-
And his egghead son. We'll give 'em a rough reception, won't we?
You know, I think I lost my little black book on that lousy thing.

What was that?
Yes? Southern Sea Salvage,
Ogata speaking.
What?
Right, I understand.
As soon as possible.
Emiko, I'm sorry...
What is it? An accident?
The Coast Guard received a distress call.
I'll have to cancel our date tonight.
I'm sorry I can't go with you, but you can still see it if you hurry.
It's a shame, but it's your job.
Well, you'd better hurry.
Southern Sea Steamship Company vessel, the "Eiko-maru," a 7,500-ton freighter, was reported lost... on August 13 at 19:05 hours.
Its last position, latitude 24 degrees north, longitude 141.02 degrees east.
Contact was lost for unknown reasons.
All units in sectors 3 and 4 stand by for action!
Thank you for calling me.
Thank you again.
What could have happened?
We have no idea.
It seems like there was a sudden explosion.
Communications suddenly halted shortly after we received their SOS.
Well, the "Bingo-maru" is approaching the area now.
We'll learn more soon enough.
They are here.
Certainly. The "Eiko-maru" and
"Bingo-maru" are both owned by the Southern Sea
Steamship Company.
Yes. They don't know how.
Can't you tell us if any survivors were seen?
Please wait a little longer.
We have a helicopter and two ships searching the area now.
We won't be sure of anything until we get their report.
Excuse me, why not send more ships?
Two ships are not enough for this!
No, we're not limiting the search party to two ships.
We'll make every effort to conduct a thorough search.
Until then, please be patient.
Hey!
Help us, please!
We're here! Hang in there!
It was incredible.
The ocean just blew up!
Blew up?
So far, three survivors were picked up by a fishing boat.
They are being taken to Odo Island.
We have sent the vessel "Kotaka" to assist them.
Which ship were the survivors from... the "Eiko-maru" or the "Bingo-maru"?
We are still investigating, but their names will be released soon enough.
I hope the three men know what happened.
We need to know more about the accidents.
Just a moment! Please, wait!
What's the matter?
I can't believe it.
I just can't believe it!
The fishing boat sank the same way.
News desk! Ah, Mr. Yamana?
Mr. Yamana, the other search boat was sunk!
In the same area... yes.
Yes, in the same way!
We're tired of hearing the same thing!
Please tell us what happened!
Please give us a chance to investigate!
Don't you know what's going on?
I'm sorry, but you must be patient!
Wait, please wait!
A drifting sea mine, or an underwater volcanic eruption?
One shipwreck after another!
I can't imagine, could it be a volcano?
Izuma! Is there something out there?
Ah, it's a raft!
Hey, there's a raft out there!
A raft is coming this way!
A raft is coming!
Hey! Over here!
Build up the fire!
Build up the fire!
It's Masaji! It's Masaji!
Masaji!
Masaji! Hold on! Masaji!
Hang on!
Brother!
Masaji! Masaji!
Masaji!
He did it...
What?!
A monster...
What did this?!
Masaji! What did this?!
It's no good!
We didn't catch anything!
It can't get any worse than this!
Then...
Godzilla must have done it.
The old man and Godzilla, both relics from days past!
Hey! What do you know about the old days?!
If you all keep thinking like that, you'll all become prey for Godzilla!
Anyhow, there must be some kind of animal in the sea.
That's why we can't catch anything.
But a creature that big would...
I knew it was stupid to open my mouth!
I try to tell you all, but nobody listens!
Shinkichi, let's go.
Ah, sir! Sir, sir!
Godzilla?
It's the name of a monster that lives in the sea.
It will come from the ocean to feed on humankind to survive.
In the old days, during times when the fishing was poor, we used to sacrifice girls to prevent him from eating us all, yes!
Now, this exorcism ceremony is all that remains of the old traditions.
Godzilla?
Shinkichi!
Shinkichi! Stay inside!
Shinkichi!
Shinkichi!
Brother!
Brother! Run, brother!
Brother! Run, brother!
Hey, hey!
Shinkichi, what's wrong?!
Brother!
Odo Island Representatives
Mr. Ooyama.
There have been 17 houses destroyed with nine deaths...
I have heard that there were other damages.
Could you please tell us how bad they are?
Odo Island Village Mayor,
Mr. Inada.
Certainly, of course.
Twelve cows and eight pigs died.
I'm not lying!
It was hard to see in the dark, but it was an animal!
I know it goes against common sense, but the more I think about it, the more I am convinced that it was definitely not a normal hurricane.
The way the houses and helicopter were destroyed, it seems as if they were crushed from above!
Now, finally, we will hear the opinion of expert paleontologist
Professor Kyohei Yamane.
I suppose my opinion is a bit premature before a thorough investigation, but we are all aware of the discovery in the Himalayas of the alleged
"snowman footprints."
It is a mystery we have yet to solve.
The earth has many deep pockets, abyssal regions that contain secrets we have yet to discover.
For this incident,
I request the formation of a fact-finding party for a full investigation.
Good Luck,
Odo Island Research Party!
Good-bye!
We'll see you soon!
It was surprising to see
Dr. Serizawa at our departure.
He rarely leaves his laboratory.
I don't know if he believes this will be our final journey.
Well, what could go wrong?
Of course, we can avoid dangerous waters, but anything can happen.
For the time being, please don't use the water from this well.
It's dangerous.
This is horrible!
We can't use the well anymore?
Professor, if there was radioactive fallout, wouldn't the wells on the other side of the island be affected?
Yes. Why is it that the wells in this area were the only ones affected?
It doesn't make any sense.
Mr. Hagiwara, I think this depression might be the footprint of a creature.
Would you agree with me?
Is that true, Professor?
This footprint is radioactive.
Everybody, it's very dangerous here! Please step back!
Step back! Step back!
Emiko, look!
It's a trilobite!
A three-lobed creature that has long since been extinct!
Professor!
You shouldn't be touching that!
Professor, what is that thing?
This is... an incredible discovery!
It's on the other side of the hill!
It's on the other side of the hill!
Father!
What is it?
Tanabe, I saw it!
A creature from the Jurassic Period!
Where is it?
Emiko! Emiko!
Emiko!
Father!
This way! This way!
This way! This way!
What is that?
Those are footprints.
About 2 million years ago, this brontosaurus and these other dinosaurs roamed the earth during a period the experts called Jurassic.
During the following geological period, the Cretaceous, a creature somewhere between the marine reptiles and the evolving terrestrial animals was born.
I am convinced there was such an intermediate creature.
This creature, according to Odo Island folklore, is called Godzilla.
As we look at this photo of Godzilla's head from a hill on Odo Island, we can estimate that this creature stands approximately
50 meters tall.
So then, how can we explain the presence of such a creature during the present day?
It probably survived by eating deep sea organisms occupying a specific niche.
However, recent experimental nuclear detonations may have drastically altered its natural habitat.
I would even speculate that a hydrogen bomb explosion may have removed it from its surroundings.
Incredible!
Really!
I have strong evidence to support my theory.
First, the organism we found embedded in Godzilla's footprint, a trilobite.
This is a photo of the creature.
This is it.
This creature has been extinct for two million years, yet here it is in perfect physical condition.
Next is the sediment that we found in the trilobite's shell.
That sediment is sand.
There is no doubt that this sand matches the deposits found from the Jurassic period.
This sand is similar to the red clay found in the stratum of that particular period.
Professor, how do you know that this has something to do with the atomic bombs?
Because our Geiger counter readings of the radiation in this sand indicate the presence of Strontium-90.
Professor Tanabiya will explain this better in a moment, but basically, this sand that came from Godzilla has absorbed a massive dose of radiation, the type generated only from an atomic bomb.
Order, please! Order, please!
The evidence suggests that Godzilla itself must have absorbed an enormous amount of atomic radiation.
Order, please! Order, please!
Chairman! Chairman!
Mr. Ooyama.
I believe
Professor Yamane's report is of such extreme importance, it must not be made public.
What are you saying?!
Because it is so important, it should be made public!
Yes! Yes!
Be quiet!
What I mean is, if this Godzilla is the product from the use of atomic weapons...
Exactly!
That's exactly what it is!
She's right!
That's my point!
World affairs are fragile enough as it is!
If this were to be made public, can you imagine the consequences?
The truth is the truth!
That is what makes it such a delicate matter!
The improper handling of such a notion would engulf the country in a panic!
The government, the economy and international relations would plunge into total chaos!
You stupid idiot!
What are you saying?!
You dare to call me an idiot?!
Apologize! Apologize!
The truth must be made public!
Counter-Godzilla Headquarters
Established.
Seventeen Ships Already Lost.
It's terrible, huh?
Contaminated tuna and radioactive fallout, and now this Godzilla to top it all off!
What will happen if he appears out of Tokyo Bay?
First, he'll probably eat you in one bite.
You're horrible!
They seemed certain about the accuracy of their report.
How could we create such a thing?
I guess I'll have to find a shelter soon.
Find one for me, too!
The shelters again?
That stinks.
Counter-Godzilla Headquarters
Isn't there any way they can get rid of this creature?
Longitude 138 to 138.07 degrees east.
Latitude 33.04 to 33.08 degrees north.
These are the coordinates of the anti-Godzilla frigate fleet.
Depth charges will be dropped in the area.
So vessels in the vicinity should be warned.
That's all.
Is that all?
That's all.
In response to the public outcry, the government is attempting to get rid of the monster known as Godzilla.
A frigate fleet has been ordered to begin a massive depth-charge attack in order to get rid of the creature.
The 10 vessel fleet left port at 10:00 a.m., heading for the coast of Odo Island.
At 10:19 a.m., they received orders to commence with their attack.
What's wrong with them?
The professor is a zoologist.
He doesn't want them to kill Godzilla.
Father! Father!
Father...
Please leave me alone for a while.
Emiko, please turn off the light.
Yes.
Godzilla! It's Godzilla!
Watch out! Watch out!
Please don't panic!
What a bother!
Have you tried solving the problem together?
They're sticking to their point of view.
How much longer will they keep us waiting like this?
For as long as they want.
It's annoying!
Please, Professor. Have a seat.
Excuse me.
Thank you for coming.
You're welcome.
This is quite a problem,
Professor.
If this keeps up, we'll have to suspend the international ship routes.
Have you found a way?
Is there something we can do to defeat him?
So, that's it?
Professor Yamane, let's be honest.
If there's a way to defeat
Godzilla, we'd like to know.
It's impossible!
He absorbed massive amounts of atomic radiation, but Godzilla still survived.
What do you think could kill him?
Instead, we should focus on why he is still alive.
That should be our top priority!
Professor Yamane's argument is absolutely correct!
This isn't the time to behave like idiots.
We should focus on scientific research!
Yes, but research at what cost?
You're right!
That's the question!
Hagiwara, interview this gentleman.
Dr. Serizawa?
Yes, he's Professor Yamane's future son-in-law.
Oh? The girl's fiance?
I'm sure my father will understand.
There's no reason for him to apologize.
But I can't help feeling uneasy when I think about Serizawa.
If it wasn't for the war, he wouldn't have received such a terrible scar.
Ogata...
Ever since I was a child,
I've always thought of him as an older brother.
Even now, my feelings for him have not changed at all.
Emiko, thanks.
Miss, Mr. Hagiwara would like to see you.
Mr. Hagiwara?
Yes, the reporter.
Hello! Excuse me.
Thank you.
What do you want?
Um... I'd like to ask you a favor.
The truth is, I tried to talk to Dr. Serizawa, but he refused to see me.
So, I was wondering if you could introduce me to him?
It's for our daily newspaper.
I'm sorry, but I need your help.
It's perfect.
I should go along with you to speak with Serizawa personally.
You're right, but I should break it to him my way.
Please let me go to speak with him first.
You're right. Well, go ahead.
Thank you. I'm sorry, but we should go.
I have a ride waiting outside.
I'll try my best to talk to him.
I'll help Shinkichi with his studies. See you later.
Serizawa Research Laboratory
There must be some mistake.
I haven't spoken to anyone about the importance of my research.
It's the truth.
A journalist in Switzerland met with a German scientist who stated that your project would be an incredible breakthrough in anti-Godzilla operations in Japan when completed.
I don't have any German scientist associates.
Really? Then what is the nature of your research right now?
No. I'd rather not speak about it.
Well, thank you for your time.
No, I'm sorry that I wasn't much help.
Excuse me.
I'll stay a little longer.
Really? Then, I'll be going.
I wanted to find out what his research was all about.
He's very moody, but please try to ask him again at another time.
I will. Good-bye.
Have a safe trip.
Well, what are you really studying now?
My father is also wondering what you are studying these days.
Emiko, would you like to see it?
Yes.
This must be strictly confidential.
Sure.
I'm risking my life in this project.
Would you be able to keep it a secret?
Follow me.
Wow!
Get back!
Emiko, you're the only one
I've shown this to.
Don't forget it.
Yes, I'll keep my promise.
Welcome back. We missed you.
Welcome home.
Did anything happen?
No, it was nothing.
Has Emiko come back?
Yes!
Godzilla!
Godzilla has come back!
Ogata!
I couldn't tell him about us.
I am Yamane, Professor Yamane!
I'm sorry, but I've been ordered not to let anyone pass!
Then tell your commander not to use lights on Godzilla!
They will only make him angry!
He can't be bothered by that now!
Professor, let's go to that hill.
Get back, please!
Get back, please!
International Researchers to Assist!
We are preparing to construct a 30 meter high, 80 meter deep barbed-wire fence along the coast.
We will send 50,000 volts of electric current through the fence in hope of electrocuting Godzilla to death.
We will have to evacuate the people along the coast, of course, and maintain a safe distance of 500 meters from the entire fence perimeter.
The Coast Guard and the Army will work to implement this defense plan.
Hurry! Hurry!
This is a Security
Command Announcement.
At 16:30 hours, Godzilla was sighted north of Kasonzaki, moving in a northeast direction.
A maximum security alert has been issued for the coastal zones in the Tokyo vicinity.
Third District. Third District.
Check! Check!
Third district!
Check!
This is a special news report.
This is a special news report.
All residents of the Minato,
Shinagawa and Osaku districts are to begin evacuating immediately.
Repeating, all residents of the Minato, Shinagawa and Osaku districts are to begin evacuating immediately.
Please keep your radio on for further reports.
Emiko, today I'm going to ask for your father's consent.
Will that be all right?
Welcome home.
What happened, Father?
All they can think about is killing Godzilla.
Why can't they try to study him from a radiological perspective?
It's an unique opportunity!
Professor, I agree with them.
Ogata, I do not take this matter lightly.
Godzilla is something that no one in the world has ever seen, and only those of us in Japan can study it!
But, Professor, that's no reason to do nothing while this monster ravages our country.
Isn't Godzilla a product of the atomic bomb that still haunts many of us Japanese?
Don't you think we should study what keeps a creature like this alive, regardless of the radiation it absorbs!
But...
All you want is to kill Godzilla, too?!
Go away! Get out of my house!
I'm very sorry.
No, I shouldn't have upset him like that.
No, Father has been like this.
Emiko, give me a chance to see him again.
This is a special bulletin!
This is a special bulletin!
Godzilla was spotted moving toward the coastline several minutes ago.
The barbed-wire fence along the shoreline is about to be charged with high voltage electricity.
We repeat...
Direction, 25 to 30 degrees!
Distance, 850!
Fires are raging through the Shihabara district.
We have no way to put them out.
This is Central Command, come in, unit 465.

We'll be joining your father in just a moment!
A little longer, a little longer, and we'll be with your daddy!
This is unbelievable, absolutely unbelievable!
Yet, the unbelievable is happening at this moment, right before our very eyes!
Right now, Godzilla is leaving behind a sea of flame!
From Ginza-Owari to Shinbashi,
Tamachi, Chiba and Shinabara, it's all become a sea of flames!
Now, Godzilla is starting to move again!
It appears that he is moving beyond the city limits!
To all of our viewers, this is not a play or a movie!
This is real, the most extraordinary story of the century!
Is the world going to be destroyed by a two million-year-old monster?
All personnel to the shelters!
All personnel to the shelters!
Quickly, please!
Quickly, please!
Operational Command Staff, proceed to shelter 306!
We are reporting to you live from a short-wave transmitter.
Godzilla is now approaching this broadcasting station, heading toward our TV tower!
There is no time for us to take cover!
We don't know what will happen to us!
He is getting even closer!
It looks like our doom!
I'm watching as he grabs onto the tower!
He has incredible strength!
This broadcast is over!
Good-bye, everyone, good-bye!
Godzilla has turned Tokyo into a sea of flames!
He is moving from Ueno to Asakusa and Shinagawa, apparently heading for the river!
Damn it! Damn it!
Damn it!
Damn it! Damn it!
He's running away!
He'll be back!
What can we do?
Damn it!
How can we get rid of him?!
Damn it!
Godzilla has retreated back into the sea.
Professor Yamane has been asked to work on a plan to defeat the monster.
No details are known at this time.
That is the news for now.
Mr. Ogata from Southern Sea Salvage.
Mr. Ogata from
Southern Sea Salvage.
There has been a change in the scheduled timetable.
Please report to the briefing room for further instructions.
Thank you for your help.
Your mother will be okay.
Emiko...
Ogata, I have something important to tell you!
I can't stay quiet anymore!
I must betray him.
Betray?
Yes. I made a promise to Serizawa.
Serizawa?
It's a secret I've been keeping, even from you!
But, now, I have to break my promise!
It happened on the day that Mr. Hagiwara and I went to see him.
That's when it happened.
Get back!
What was that?
Yes. All of the oxygen in the water was disintegrated.
The organisms in the tank died of asphyxiation.
Their remains were liquified by my Oxygen Destroyer.
Overall, it's a device that splits oxygen atoms into fluids.
My...
I intended to devote my work to the study of the element oxygen.
But, in the course of my research,
I came across an unknown form of energy.
In my first experiment,
I discovered a powerful force that scared me beyond words.
I didn't eat for two or three days!
Just a little piece of this, dropped into the water, could turn the entire Tokyo Bay into a graveyard!
Why are you working on such an awful project?
Emiko! I perform my work strictly as a research scientist!
But what if... what if your discovery is used for some horrible purpose?
You're right.
Used as a weapon, this would be as powerful as a nuclear bomb.
It could totally destroy humankind!
But I believe I can find a use for the Oxygen Destroyer that will benefit society.
Until then,
I won't reveal its existence.
That's why I didn't say anything to the reporter.
If I am forced to surrender this device in its present form...
I'll make sure the results of my experiments are destroyed in the event of my death.
I understand.
I won't tell anyone about this, not even my own father.
I had to break my promise.
So that's it?
But, Emiko, considering what Serizawa said, and the fact that this thing can be of help,
I'm sure he will forgive you for this.
Hello. Welcome back.
Serizawa.
What? Oh, it's you.
I have a favor to ask you today.
Well, have a seat.
What do you want from me?
I want to use the Oxygen Destroyer.
What Oxygen Destroyer?
I don't know what you're talking about!
Serizawa, why are you pretending?
Pretending?
Serizawa, I broke the promise
I made to you.
So I told him everything!
Please let him use the device!
I'm sorry! Please forgive me!
Emiko wanted to help after seeing the destruction.
Please try to forgive her.
Your device is our only hope!
Ogata, if Emiko told you everything about my device, you should know why I can't let you use it.
I must refuse!
Serizawa!
No!
Why is it wrong to use it for this?
Please go home!
Serizawa!
Serizawa!
Open the door, please! Serizawa!
Serizawa! What are you doing?!
Leave me alone!
Do you want to destroy years of research?
Let go!
Stop, please!
Serizawa!
Ogata!
Ogata!
Ogata, forgive me.
If my device can serve a good purpose,
I would announce it to everyone in the world!
But in its current form, it is just a weapon of horrible destruction!
Please understand, Ogata!
I understand, but if we don't use your device against Godzilla, what are we going to do?
Ogata, if the Oxygen Destroyer is used even once, politicians from around the world will see it.
Of course, they'll want to use it as a weapon.
Bombs vs. Bombs, missiles vs. Missiles, and now a new super weapon to throw upon us all!
As a scientist, no, as a human being,
I can't allow that to happen!
Am I right?
Well, what do we do about the horror before us now?
Should we just let it happen?
If anyone can save us now,
Serizawa, you're the only one!
If... you use the device to defeat Godzilla, unless you reveal what you have done, who will know about it?
Ogata, humans are weak animals.
Even if I burn my notes, the secret will still be in my head.
Until I die, how can I be sure
I won't be forced by someone to make the device again?
What am I going to do?
"Oh Peace, Oh Light, Return," the prayer for peace that took place all over the country today.
Here we see the Tokyo chapter of this event.
Listen to the young voices as they put the strength of their lives into their song.
May we live without destruction
May we look to tomorrow with hope
May peace and light return to us.
Serizawa!
Ogata, you are right.
But this will be the first and last time that I will ever allow the Oxygen Destroyer to be used.
Don't cry, Emiko.
This is the only way to be sure that it won't fall into the wrong hands.
We are getting closer to the moment of truth.
We will soon know if Godzilla, the monster that has terrorized the world will be finally buried forever in the ocean depths.
At this time, Geiger-counter readings are being used to pinpoint Godzilla's location.
Ogata, get me a diving suit.
What are you saying?!
You have no experience in using a diving suit!
Serizawa... Ogata is right.
Let him do it.
Professor, this is the only Oxygen Destroyer
I have!
To use it properly,
I have to do it underwater.
All right.
We'll do it together.
No. I'll do this myself.
You're crazy.
I won't allow someone with no experience to go down alone!
Hey! Get another diving suit ready!
Okay? Please don't go down alone!
Will the only Oxygen Destroyer in the world be powerful enough to do the job?
Its inventor, Dr. Serizawa, remains silent.
All we can do now is pray for its success.
Professor...
I never thought
I'd reveal it in this way.
I'll be praying for you.
All right!
You two be very careful.
Ogata, we're counting on you.
Right!
The time has come.
Right now, Dr. Serizawa is being lowered into the water.
They've reached the bottom!
Pull!
Start pulling!
Serizawa! Serizawa!
Serizawa!
Serizawa! Serizawa!
What's going on?! Serizawa!
Ogata, it worked!
Both of you, be happy.
Good-bye... farewell!
Serizawa! Hey, bring him up!
Serizawa!
Serizawa...
This exhilaration, this jubilation, we have won!
We can see that Godzilla will never rise from the ocean's depths again!
This victory could not be achieved if it weren't for the young scientist, Dr. Serizawa.
He wanted us to be happy...
I can't believe that Godzilla was the only surviving member of its species...
But, if we keep on conducting nuclear tests, it's possible that another
Godzilla might appear... somewhere in the world, again.
Salute!
At ease!

Doctor Kruger,
Colonel Banks speaking.
Would you mind coming into my office right away, please?
Thank you.
As I was saying, our search planes
Found the wreckage of your husband's plane, Mrs Martin.
A rescue crew was sent out, but...
But they must have reached the wreckage hours ago.
Why can't they find him?
I honestly don't know, Mrs Martin.
[KNOCKING AT DOOR]
Yes, come in.
CURT KRUGER: Ellen.
Curt.
Colonel Banks, isn't there any hope?
COLONEL BANKS: I'm afraid not, Mrs Martin.
They found the pilot dead in the wreckage,
And according to all reports, no one could have bailed out.
I'm terribly sorry.
[SOBBING]
Doctor Martin!
Doctor Martin, are you all right?
I, I am, yes.
It's Doctor Martin.
Call the base hospital.
Come on, doctor, come on.
All right, look up to your right.
Now, look over to your left.
All right, you can get up now.
Well, everything seems all right, except can't you recall
Anything that happened from the time your plane crashed until...
I remember the controls froze.
The next thing I saw was the main gate of the base.
Your plane was completely demolished,
The pilot burned to death, and you
Show up the picture of health.
Are you sure you weren't driven here?
Positive.
You don't remember where you got this?
Mm-mm.
You know, your medical chart shows
No indication of any scars on your body.
I must have got it in the crash.
No, no this was surgery, a very skillful incision.
I've never had an operation.
Now, that's what
I don't understand.
Mr Briggs.
Colonel Banks.
How are you, Mr Briggs?
Fine, how are you?
Fine, I see the FBI doesn't waste much time.
Well, uh, not if we can help it, Colonel.
Oh, you know our base surgeon, Major Clift?
Sure.
How have you been, Major?
How do you do?
Well, I guess you gentlemen have business to discuss.
Oh, no, no, this won't take a minute.
Sit down.
Sit down if you please, gentlemen.
Cigarette?
Oh, thank you.
I understand you've already talked with Doctor Martin.
I just left him.
You know, ah, Colonel, um, according to my files,
Doctor Martin is just about the key man
On this nuclear project.
Yes, along with
Doctor Kruger, he is.
Well, I know they're both good friends,
And, uh, well, both have knowledge
And access to top secret information.
Well, that's very true, but there's no
Reason to suspect that they...
Oh, we can, uh, we can suspect anything, Colonel,
Until Doctor Martin accounts for every minute
From the time of the crash.
The shock must have caused a mental block.
His mind doesn't want to remember the details,
The origin of the scar on his chest,
How he got back to the base under his own power.
Did you ever stop to think that perhaps this Doctor
Martin isn't really the Doctor Martin?
What are you getting at?
What I mean is that, uh, this man could be an imposter.
[PHONE RINGING]
Briggs speaking.
Oh, oh they did come through, huh?
They do check?
That's what I've been waiting for, thanks.
Get me Colonel Banks at the base, please No, no, I'll wait.
Oh yes, Mr Briggs.
Any news on the line you were getting on Doctor Martin.
Just heard from
Washington, and I was wrong,
This is our man, all right.
His prints and description check right down the line.
Now, here's what
I suggest you do.
But you say he's in excellent physical condition,
Yet you're keeping him in the base hospital.
Why?
Mrs Martin, you must realize that your husband is
Engaged in a highly secret work.
If this experience had, well, affected his mind...
Are you trying to tell me that Doug is...
No, no, no, it's nothing serious, Mrs Martin.
His reflexes are excellent, except for that one lapse
Of memory, his mind is perfectly clear.
Isn't that natural under the circumstances?
Yes, except for the question of the scar on his chest.
I know he didn't have it before the crash.
Well, I'm sure he didn't,
Mrs Martin, but you see,
It would be impossible for a wound of the size
To have healed so quickly and without medical attention.
Well, you can't keep him here indefinitely.
We don't intend to.
We asked you to come down here, because we've
Decided to let you take him home, provided you can keep
It quiet and he gets enough rest.
I understand.
Now we'll just have to take that vacation
He's been wanting for so long.
Vacation.
To watch him, you'd think he'd never heard of one.
Yes, he must have asked me 100 times
When the next test was scheduled.
He's anxious to take his own readings, again.
Well, he did have a key part in the planning of these projects.
Well, is there anything he should
Or shouldn't be allowed to do?
No, except he does need diversion,
Anything that won't upset or excite him.
I see, movies, bridge, drives, things like that.
Well, you're the doctor, now.
Just see that he gets plenty of rest.
Thank you.
Good bye, Colonel.
Good bye.
See you later, Major.
[MOANING]
Doug, what's the matter?
I can't sleep.
What time is it?
Little after three.
I'm going to go get myself a glass of milk.
Get me squadron operation.
Duty desk, please.
Ellen, what did you get up for?
This is Doctor Martin calling.
Who is this speaking?
Sergeant Bandero.
Is there anything I can do for you, Doctor?
I wondered if there were any last minute
Orders on another atomic test.
What do you mean, you can't tell me?
Sorry sir, regulations.
I can't give out information to anyone.
No sir, it won't do you any good to come down.
All right, we'll see about that.
I've got to get out to the base right away.
Ellen don't you agree with me?
I've spent months preparing for this series of tests,
And no Sergeant is going push me around, now.
Well, aren't you say anything?
No.
Look, I know they're ready for another test,
And I should be there.
Can't you understand that they don't
Want you around for your own good?
I don't need their sympathy.
There's nothing wrong with me.
Then why are you acting this way?
You're all on edge.
If you don't slow down, I don't know what's going to happen.
You really believe that, don't you.
Look Doug, if you won't take it easy for your own sake,
Please, do it for mine.
Hey.
Hey, time to get up.
Go away.
All right stay in bed all day.
It's almost 11 o'clock.
What'd you say?
I said it was almost 11 o'clock.
It is?
Mhmm.
Oh, you go put the coffee on while I get dressed.
I don't care what you say, you had
No right to go ahead without me.
And you, Curt, you didn't tell me, either.
Why?
Orders, Doug.
Orders, nonsense.
The least that could have been done
Would have been to let me know.
I'm fine.
I could have done my work.
I hate to say this, Doctor Martin,
But in your present state, you're
Not considered a very good security risk.
Me, security risk?
My present state?
What's the matter with me?
How long am I to be considered...
Only temporarily.
The results of the test will be available for your study
When you return to work.
I am ready, Colonel.
To us, you're still a very sick man.
My advice to you is to go home and relax as you were ordered.
Relax, relax!
And if I don't?
Then you'll be confined to the base
Hospital 'til you change your mind.
Now, what's it going to be?
Well, Doctor.
Oh, Doctor Martin.
I didn't expect you back so soon.
Why, haven't you heard?
I'm a mental case.
Can't even be trusted with my own work.
Ah!
Liable to go berserk at any minute.
Colonel Banks will fill you in on the details.
Now, don't, don't tell me, let me see, you're, uh,
I know, I know, you're
Miss, uh, Vincent,
The secretary I share with, uh, hmm...
Oh Doctor, you can't be serious.
Uh, there was no one in your office,
So I thought you wouldn't mind.
No, that's all right, it's all right.
As far as I'm concerned you can take the rest of the day off.
Are you sure?
Mhmm, oh, I don't really belong here, I just,
Uh, just came in to pick up a few personal things
From my desk.
Good bye.
Good bye.

Just a minute, Doctor.
Main gate, Sergeant Powers.
Doctor Kruger?
Doctor Kruger, Doctor
Kruger, no, he checked out.
Yeah, about 20 minutes ago.
OK.
Sorry to keep you waiting, Doctor.
That's all right.
OK, Doctor.
Will you sign out, please?
We'll post a couple of men outside
Of Doctor Kruger's office.
Get me Colonel Banks at the Officer's Club.
Thank you, Doctor.
Good night.
Good evening, Doctor Kruger.
Yes.
My name's Briggs.
I'm from the FBI.
Briggs, Briggs, of course.
I've heard of you.
I wonder if you'd mind returning to your office
With me?
What seems to be the trouble?
Oh, just a few things we'd like to straighten out.
Concerns me?
Well, I'm afraid so, Doctor.
You can take your own car, if you like.
I'll met you there.
All right, I will.
The papers seem to be intact.
Is this all, uh, classified information, Doctor?
Of course.
You know, according to security regulations,
That vault should have been locked before you left.
But I'm certain I did lock it.
All right, then tell me this, who, besides yourself,
Has access to the combination?
Well, the Colonel, here, and Doctor Martin.
Doctor Martin.
He was in building this afternoon.
That's right, we saw him in my office.
He left around 4 o'clock on orders.
He dismissed his secretary a few minutes later,
But he, he didn't sign out of here
'Til 20 minutes after you left.
After I did?
Well, there must be some mistake.
I personally checked his office just as I was leaving,
And he wasn't there.
Do you always do that?
Well no, but Doctor Martin has been acting, well,
Quite strange of late.
Yes, he certainly has.
His wife telephoned to say that he hadn't come home as usual.
I was very much concerned about him.
So am I. He still hasn't show up, yet.
What kind of pipe tobacco do you use, Doctor Kruger?
Me?
Why, I don't smoke at all.
And you, Colonel?
Cigarettes.
What are you driving at?
That's funny.
How long has Doctor Martin been using this brand of tobacco?
Well, I really don't know.
Why?
Well now, Mrs
Martin, you say you
Have no idea where he could be at this hour.
Why no, he's never been this late
Before without telephoning.
Well, I hate to ask this, but have you ever had any suspicion
That there might be another woman?
Certainly not.
I'm sorry, Mrs Martin.
Just why are you asking me these questions?
Well, let's put it this way, has he made any new friends
Lately, you know, people not in the usual group?
No, the only people we've seen in months
Have been connected with the institute.
[PHONE RINGING]

[TIRES SQUEALING]
[TIRES SQUEALING]
[HORN HONKING]
They're here, they're going to... here, they're here,
They're here, they're going to destroy us.
He's coming out of it.
It's all right, Doctor Martin.
You're with friends.
You'll be all right.
Let me go!
Let me go!
That's enough, that's enough.
They'll kill everyone.
We've got to stop them!
Easy, Doug, easy.
What did you give him?
Sodium amytal, truth serum.
It'll deprive his mind of any imagination.
I guess he'll make sense, now.
I'll get the recorder ready.
Can you hear me Doctor Martin?
DOCTOR MARTIN: Yes.
Now, listen to me, I want you to count backwards from 100.
Do you understand?
Backwards from 100.
Oh, you can ask him questions, now.
Doctor Martin, what were you doing with the information
You took from Doctor
Kruger's vault?
I was delivering it.
Delivering it?
But where?
To the rocks in Soledad Flats?
Yes, Soledad Flats, right where we crashed.
I was delivering it, just as I was ordered.
Who ordered you to do this, Doctor Martin?
I'll tell you the whole story.
I remember we were circling the atomic cloud.
There was an object glowing beneath us at Soledad Flats.
We were going down to investigate.
Controls jammed, couldn't pull out.
When I regained consciousness,
I was on a table.
Next thing I knew, they were coming at me, strange people.
Their eyes, those horrible eyes.
They didn't speak.
I could see something strange and eerie pulsating
In front of me.
Then one of them lowered it toward my chest.
It was my own heart.
What happened?
What is this place?
Who are you?
What are you doing to me?
Can't you speak?
Who are you?
Step forward.
Doctor Martin, I see you are quite well.
You have recovered from your unfortunate accident.
Who are you?
A scientist, like yourself.
Where do you come from?
From a planet yet unknown to you.
You know my name.
You speak English.
We speak every language.
You can't expect me to believe that.
I'm getting out of here.
Stay where you are.
[ELECTRICITY SURGING]
Who are you?
I have already told you that.
How did you get here?
[ELECTRICITY SURGING]
Here, in our machine, magnetically
Propelled across the electron bridge we have created.
Electron bridge?
You mean, you come and go, just like that without anyone
Ever seeing you?
Our ships have been sighted on numerous occasions
By your people.
And why haven't we been able to track one down?
We have a warning system, similar
To your primitive radar.
Our machines are set to change course
At the mere approach of a pursuing object.
Let's say I do believe you.
Where are we right now?
In a cavern within the upper crust of the Earth.
How long have you been here?
Since the beginning of your experiments in nuclear fission.
What have you got to do with that?
We are accumulating the energy released
With each of your atomic explosions.
[ENERGY SURGING]
One moment.
[SPEAKING ALIEN LANGUAGE]
What was that?
A report from the monitor we sent to the surface
To obtain the results of your last nuclear test.
Results?
They'll take days to analyze and compute.
I think you will find these figures are correct.
I can't believe it.
Where is that man?
You don't recognize the area?
No.
He is in the vicinity where you crashed.
That rock was glowing.
A normal reaction in view of the amount of radiation
Absorbed.
You have a remarkable memory,
Doctor, considering the fact
That you did not survive the crash.
What do you mean?
The mechanism of your heart, it ceased to function.
It was necessary for us to revive it.
You were dead.
I was dead?
So that's what they were doing.
You didn't even try to help the pilot, why did you save me?
Because we had an important need of your services.
Such as?
[ELECTRICITY SURGING]
Look this way, Doctor.
You will understand.
[ELECTRICITY SURGING]
Here Doctor, you are the first of your world
To be looking at our solar system, the Astran.
This is our planet,
Astran Delta.
It occupies the fourth position in relation to this, our sun.
Yes, go on.
During the 23rd time rotation our sun began to die.
So during the succeeding generations,
As our planet began to cool, vegetation began to disappear.
Our eyes developed to this state to combat
The ever-growing darkness.
We were forced to migrate.
You left your planet?
Where?
We invaded these neighboring planets.
They were nearer to our sun.
You just moved in and took over?
How many of you?
All of us, well over one billion.
There were feeble attempts to stop us,
But we were prepared for such contingencies.
And now that our sun is about to completely expire,
We must move again in order to survive.
Yours is the only planet in this solar system
Capable of supporting our civilization.
This is fantastic, over a billion
Of you trying to come here to Earth.
We had no alternative.
We have been putting our plan to work for some time.
At the proper moment, the invasion
Will be launched from out platforms,
Which are being readied in space.
[ELECTRICITY SURGING]
ALIEN: Nothing can stop us.
You must be insane.
This is ridiculous.
You cannot find your way in or out of this cavern.
Do not try to leave.
[ELECTRICITY SURGING]
[ELECTRICITY SURGING]
[ELECTRICITY SURGING]
[AMPLIFIED ANIMAL NOISES]
[LAUGHING]
So you have discovered our menagerie.
Don't you think you will be more at ease
On this side of the cage?
I... it's horrible.
What are you doing here?
We are breeding our, shall I say, armies?
Those carnivorous insects and animals?
What have you done to them?
Their growth is due to a change in their genes.
At your next nuclear test, these animals will multiply at a rate
Beyond imagination.
When the time comes, we will unleash them.
They will spread to every continent
And devour every living thing on the surface of the Earth.
Well, what good will that do you?
How could you expect to survive better than we?
We have provided for that.
[ELECTRICITY SURGING]
No, Doctor, look over there.
We will use their bodies to fertilize the soil.
Vegetation will rise up in abundance.
A new era of civilization will begin.
Gamma rays?
You see, Doctor, we have arranged for everything.
Wait a minute.
All this equipment?
Our nucleostorage units.
To date, we have accumulated several billion electron volts
As a result of your atomic explosions.
Several billion?
Why, a chain reaction at this point,
Could release enough unstable isotopes to,
To create a new and powerful element,
Might be impossible to control.
True, an element that will never
Be known by your scientists.
I can assure you the strength of this new element-
- Well, this is a powder keg, could go up at any minute.
I assure you, Doctor, we have everything
Under our complete control.
What force could possibly be strong enough
To harness the...
Now, you control
Your whole operation by electricity.
Of course, no generators, no generators.
That means you're getting your power
From somewhere on the surface.
It must be passing through here.
You have heard enough, Doctor Martin.
Step inside.
All right.
What do you want from me?
You will have access to advanced information
Relative to the time and strength
Of the forthcoming atomic tests.
What about it?
You will provide us with that information
As soon as it is available.
I see.
You're afraid of an overload.
You can't tap enough electricity, wherever you get
It from, to hold a strong enough charge.
You are a clever man,
Doctor, perhaps too clever.
And what makes you think
I'll give you any information?
It is the only way you can save your own life
When the time comes.
You will be transported to one of our platforms in space
And resettled here when our operation is completed.
You're asking me to sabotage the entire world,
Three billion people.
They are doomed in any case.
Well, I guess there's no alternative.
I have to do as you say.
You are lying, Doctor.
Your only wish is to betray us.
No.
I know.
Your thoughts have been recorded.
Lie detector?
Call it what you like.
You force me to resort to other methods.
I will contact our space station.
MALE VOICE: You are an unwilling subject, Doctor Martin.
What?
Who are you?
I am The Tala.
You will listen and obey.
No, I...
You will listen to my orders and obey me.
You will listen and obey.
Listen...
And obey.
You will remember nothing you have seen or heard here,
Nothing but my orders, which you will obey.
Yes.
You will obtain the data, and bring it
To the stone near the place where your plane was wrecked.
DOCTOR MARTIN: To the stone.
What have you seen or heard here?
What have you seen or heard here?
Nothing.
Repeat my orders.
I will obtain the data and bring it to the stone.
Well, that's what I did.
I took the information to where they told me.
I didn't realize I was being mesmerized.
Why didn't somebody say something?
Don't you believe me?
Curt, you understand.
These giant animals, breeding by the millions,
They'll devour everything unless we stop them.
Of course, Doug, we will.
Colonel, Colonel, you've got to arrange to set off other bomb,
Tonight, the strongest charge we have.
They're beneath the ground with all their equipment.
We can blow them to pieces.
Now, wait a minute.
A strong charge will overload their units.
You, you don't believe me, Colonel?
Major?
Curt?
Of course we do.
Easy, Doug, easy.
You think I'm crazy, all of you.
Well, I'm not.
Do you understand?
Everything I said is true.
I saw it with my own eyes.
Give me a hand, Doctor.
No, let me go!
Let me go!
Steady, steady, steady, take it easy.
Take it easy.
We'll talk this whole thing over.
(SLEEPILY) What are you doing to me, now?
You just rest quietly.
That's it.
Mrs Martin should be along any minute, now.
She went for their car.
What'll I tell her?
Well, he's in a state of shock.
Tell her he's resting quietly.
If you'll excuse me,
I think I'd better
Wait for her at the information desk.
Well, Doctor Martin seems to be indestructible,
Except for those hallucinations.
Those weren't hallucinations, Colonel.
Under the influence of sodium amytal,
A patient loses all control of his imagination.
Well, then he shouldn't be able to fabricate those stores.
That's right.
Major, you're not trying to tell us that everything he said
Was true?
Look, gentleman, I can only give you the medical facts.
As for the rest, you'll have to decide for yourself.
Excuse me, please.
[CAR REVVING]
Good evening, Doctor Kruger.
Chili isn't it?
Oh, Mr Briggs, you startled me.
I didn't expect to see anyone here.
Well, neither did I, Doctor.
Well, I suppose you want me to explain why I'm here.
Mhmm.
I want to believe Doug.
We've worked together a long time.
Anyway, I just had to come out here and check for myself.
Check what, Doctor?
For an entrance or an exit to the caverns he described.
I'm afraid you're wasting your time.
Cigarette, Doctor?
No, think you.
See, we've already covered the entire area.
We couldn't find a thing.
Then what about that scar?
I'd like to see you disprove that.
Oh, Mrs Martin.
Oh, how is he, Doctor?
Oh, he's resting fine.
I think he'll be all right.
How's the car?
There's nothing to worry about...
DOCTOR MARTIN:
Keep away from me.
Keep away, I said!
Stop!
Let me go!
They're after me!
Nobody's after you, Doctor Martin.
Keep away!
Doug, he's trying to help you.
I don't need any help!
I, I want to see
Curt, right away.
Now, you control yourself, and I'll call him just as
Soon as you get back to your room.
Now, you get back into bed, and I'll call Doctor Kruger.
I, I've got to figure something out before he gets here.
I'll need a pencil, some paper, and a slide rule.
I'll see that you get it.
Oh, can I have Doctor
Kruger, please.
[PHONE RINGING]
Doctor Kruger speaking.
Oh yes, Major, how is he?
All right, I'll be over in a few minutes.
Doug.
Doug.
Doug.
Curt!
Ellen, I got here as soon as I could.
Is there anything wrong?
He's much better.
And Major, he's even started working.
He asked for paper and a slide rule.
That's interesting.
I wonder what he's up to.
Formulas, equations, anyway, whatever he said,
Pretend to agree with him, Major Clift's orders.
Of course.
Doug.
Doug, Curt's here.
Hello, Doug.
Just a second.
I'm almost finished.
I'll take your hat.
Thank you.
Curt, let's face it.
I know that you all think there's
Something wrong with me.
No, of course not.
No, I wouldn't blame you after the story I told last night.
Well, frankly you did have us a little worried
Asking that a bomb be dropped because of what you said.
Now, you don't believe me, either.
Curt, I tell you,
I've been there.
I've seen what they're doing, breeding animals
Into carnivorous monsters, but I don't need a bomb to stop them.
I've figured it out.
It's all here.
Now look, here's the nuclear strength of our last test,
And this is the amount of electricity
Needed to control it.
Let me see that.
I had to estimate the conversion
Rates of their transformers.
If these figures are correct, such transforms
Must operate on a constant supply of electricity.
Where could they get that much electric power?
Only one way, they must tap it from the main lines
At the power house.
If they do it by parallel induction,
Nobody'd ever know the difference.
All we have to do is to cut it off.
Cut off the power?
We can't do that.
It would cause untold damage for miles around.
Such a power stoppage must be planned in advance.
8 to 10 seconds, that's all I need.
That gap in supply will short out their resistors
And the whole thing'll go up.
But you won't go along with that, no no, not you.
Doug get back in bed.
I've got the car keys.
Now look, you're carrying this too far.
Out of my way.
Doug!
Please call the main gate and try to stop Doctor Martin.
Doug took the car, hurry!
Doctor Martin!
Stop!
[TIRES SQUEALING]
Stop!
He did what?
How long ago?
Right, we'll leave immediately.
What's wrong, Colonel?
Doctor Martin, he's on his way to the power house,
Wants to cut off the power supply.
Well, let's go.
I couldn't stop him,
Doctor, he went that way.
[TIRES SQUEALING]
Hey, no parking!
[LOUD MACHINERY]
[PHONE RINGING]
OK, you run up the stairs, I'll look here.
[TIRES SQUEALING]
There's his car.
Come on, hurry!
He isn't back there.
Let's go.
Where is the driver of this car?
He went into the building.
We better take the stairs.
What do you want?
Where are the main switches?
Hey, what's the with you?
You sleep walking or something, Mister?
Where are the switches that control the...
[PHONE RINGING]
Soledad Flats area?
I said, where are they?
This way.
[PHONE RINGING]
Phone.
Control room.
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
Come on.
Show me those switches, come on!
All right.
Cut that power.
Now look, Mister, be reasonable.
I said, cut it.
Now the next one.
Next.
Go on.
That'll turn the power off for 100 miles.
Do as I say.
Stay where you are.
Put down that gun, Doctor Martin.
I'm warning you, Colonel, come any closer and I'll kill him.
Now the next one.
What's this one?
That's the master switch.
Cut it.
ELLEN MARTIN: Doug, please, don't.
I said, cut it.
Get back or I'll kill him.
Go on, get back.
Go on, get back.
Do as he says.
DOUG MARTIN: Give me 10 seconds after I cut the power.
If I'm insane, nothing will happen,
And you can do what you want with me.
But if I'm right...
Now, one, two, three,
Four, five, six, seven, eight...
[LOUD RUMBLING]
Over here.
Soledad Flats, right on the button.
Just as he said.
He blew them to pieces.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
- What's the score, Doc?
- Twins. Cutest things you ever saw.
Hey, they're keeping you busy these days.
It's the desert. Gives people wonderful ideas.
- Check the ship, will you?
- You betcha.
Hiya, Doc. Phone's been ringing like crazy for you.
Sheriff's half out of his mind.
- Call him for me, will you, Josh?
- Yeah.
- I'm ringing him, Doc.
- That's fine.
- He's on, Doc.
- Thanks, Josh.
Hello, Jack. What's up?
Can you come over right away, Doc?
I hate to bother you.
I know you've been up all night, but this is important.
Okay.
Doc, sure sounded worried, didn't he?
Someday, you old codger, you're going to hear something you won't like.
Are you inferring that
I was listening in?
Yeah.
Hi, Jack. What's all the excitement about? Who's sick?
- Nobody.
- Huh?
The boys found a man near the highway this morning.
- Run over?
- No.
- Well, then?
- That's why I called you, Doc.
- What's it look like?
- Like nothing I've ever seen before.
Who is it?
Well, he has the same general build as Eric Jacobs, but I'm not sure.
I don't follow you.
There's something about his face says he's Jacobs... but maybe he ain't.
Look, Jack, I'm lost.
You remember Jacobs, don't you?
Yeah, he's the biologist.
Works for Prof. Deemer.
Met him a couple of years ago.
He's over at the undertaker's.
You'd better have a look.
- Hi, Charlie.
- Hi, Charlie.
I phoned Deemer right away.
He said he'd be over to see if this is him.
You know Deemer, don't you?
Yeah. When I opened my office I went out to pay my respects.
He was polite enough... but I had the feeling I wasn't welcome, so I never went back.
Some of these big brains never learnt manners.
Here he is, Barney.
- Hi, Doc.
- Hello, Barney.
You figure this one out and you're good.
Now you know why I'm not sure.
That's not Jacobs. This man has had the disease for years.
I saw Jacobs last month.
He looked okay then.
They're in the back room, Professor.
It's Eric, all right.
He was my friend for 30 years.
You better come outside, Professor.
Yes.
- You all through in there?
- Yeah.
Leave us alone for a minute, will you, Barney?
Yeah, sure.
Professor, I have to know all about it.
Why he looks that way, why he was missing.
Sheriff, have you ever watched... a friend dying before your eyes and not been able to help?
That's the worst of it.
Being helpless.
It's particularly tough when you're a physician... and you know what's wrong with him.
And there isn't a single solitary thing you or anyone else can do.
When I saw the body,
I though it was acromegalia.
But that's not possible.
Acromegalia?
The pituitary gland goes haywire, Jack.
It distorts the face, neck, hands, and feet.
I met Jacobs a couple of years ago at your place.
The sheriff saw him about a month ago. He looked normal then.
It is acromegalia.
But in every case
I've ever heard of... it's taken years to produce the deformity.
I know.
The history of medicine is the history of the unusual.
Perhaps Eric had been ill for years. Who knows?
But it was only four days ago that he began to complain of muscular pains.
Neither of us thought too much about it.
These things happen as you grow older.
And the next morning he began to...
To change.
Maybe we'd better do an autopsy just to make sure.
I don't think that'll be necessary.
I was in attendance, and I signed the death certificate.
I see.
How come we found him on the desert?
Dr. Jacobs became delirious last night.
Broke out of the house and ran into the desert.
Are you certain he hadn't complained of anything before that time?
There's nothing I can add to what I've already said.
Eric had no family. I'll arrange for the funeral.
Thank you for calling me so promptly.
- Goodbye, Dr. Hastings.
- Professor.
Acromegalia.
- You heard the man.
- I sure did.
A young fellow like you can't stack what he knows against the professor.
The trouble is, Doc, you hate to admit you're wrong.
We all make mistakes, Jack.
This isn't one of mine.
Hello.
There we go.
- Paul!
- Eric is dead. Do you hear me?
There's just you and me... and we're going to die, too.
No, Paul! Keep away from me!
I'm trying to help you. Paul!
Coco, you startled me.
So you escaped the fire?
Let me see those paws.
I'll have to do something about those burns, won't I?
Come on, Coco.
You've got that look like you swallowed the canary.
Not at all.
If there's anything a man hates it's to be told he's wrong when he knows he's right.
I knew Deemer had burnt your tail.
Listen, I'm just a country doctor, but I know what I know.
And I know acromegalia doesn't turn up in four days out of left field.
So?
So I went to the medical library in Phoenix and read up on it.
There wasn't one single recorded case in medical history... where a malformation developed as fast as Deemer said Jacobs' did.
- You mean he was lying to us?
- I don't know.
But I'd like to know why he was in such a hurry to bury Jacobs... and why he didn't want me to do an autopsy.
The man's an M.D. Like you.
He's entitled to his opinion.
Or do you want me to charge him with confusing a country doctor?
There's nothing like the safety of prestige, is there, Sheriff?
Let's skip it.
Everything's clean and legal... and I wouldn't want you to stick your neck out for anything.
What do you want me to do?
Pinch him because I don't like the way he parts his hair?
Have you ever asked yourself what Deemer and Jacobs... were working on in their lab?
No, and I don't intend to jimmy open a window to find out, either.
Deemer's speciality is nutrient biology.
Jacobs is a leader in the same field.
Now when two big shots like that get together... and hole up in the desert,
20 miles from civilization...
I'd say they might be working on something... they're not too anxious to talk about.
You think whatever they might be doing ties in with what killed Jacobs?
I wish I knew.
Oh, oh.
Joe Burch is on the warpath again.
- What'd you do this time?
- I forgot to tell him about Jacobs.
Well, good day, my very, very good friends.
A fine pair you turned out to be.
I practically had the paper put to bed... when I found out about
Jacobs by accident.
Well, I'm sorry, Joe. It slipped my mind.
What do you want to know?
Only what I haven't found out for myself.
I sneaked a look at the death certificate over at Barney's.
Got the personal dope on him out of Who's Who.
How often does this acromegalia occur, Doc?
Not very. First time I've seen it, as a matter of fact.
My dictionary says it's chronic, it doesn't mention death.
Well, death doesn't usually come from the disease itself.
It's caused by suffocation.
What do you mean, suffocation?
The tongue becomes enlarged.
The throat, the thorax, the heart... everything gets pushed out of place.
What do you think Deemer's been working on out there?
That I'd like to know.
I'll hop out with Ridley, grab a couple of pictures, and see what I can find out.
By the way, Doc... how long had Jacobs been dead when our friend here remembered to call you?
- Will you lay off?
- Eight or ten hours.
Thanks, Doc. I'll be sure to spell your name right.
As for your friend, it might just slip my mind... to support him the next time he comes up for election.
Say, that's a good idea, Jack.
Him going out to Deemer's.
Joe will get him so riled up with questions, he may take to me.
If you go into the hotel, miss, they'll tell you the best way to get there.
Thank you.
I wonder if you might tell me the best way to get out to the Deemer place?
- It's about...
- I know where it is.
Is there a bus or cab available?
Well, yes, but there won't be any buses through anymore today.
Then would you mind calling a cab for me?
I wouldn't mind it a bit.
But it wouldn't do no good.
Because Jasper, you see, it's his cab.
He's out at the Bar Six and won't be back for a couple of hours.
Maybe longer.
Well, what'll I do?
Sit down and wait.
That's all you can do.
Thank you.
You ain't come through here before, have you?
No.
Didn't think I'd seen you.
You any kin to this man, Deemer?
No, I'm not.
He any kin to you? Oh, no.
- I don't suppose that...
- I doubt it.
Me, too.
Josh, I'm expecting a call from Dan Simon.
Switch it to the Deemer place, will you?
You going out there?
- Just leaving.
- Take her with you.
Well, you see, I was asking how to get out there, but...
Well, I wouldn't want to impose on you.
He won't mind.
No, I'd be glad to drive you.
- Well, if you're sure.
- Are these yours?
Hey.
Ain't you two going to introduce yourselves?
- No.
- No.
Getting to be a fast world.
Think it's about time?
- Dr. Matt Hastings.
- Stephanie Clayton. "Steve."
I like Steve.
I'm really indebted to you,
Dr. Hastings, for this ride.
Or rather, I'm indebted to your friend Josh.
So am I.
I guess it's none of my business asking why you're going out to Deemer's place, but...
Why not?
I'm doing graduate work in biology.
The professor teaches it, or he did.
I knew it would happen.
Give women the vote and what do you get? Lady scientists.
Well, student so far.
You see, I wrote a paper on the nutritional aspects of expanding populations... and Prof. Jacobs read it and offered me a job for the summer.
How about a place to live?
There are a couple of nice boarding houses in Desert Rock.
- Cost less than a hotel.
- Well, no.
I'm going to stay at the professor's.
You see, it's all part of my contract.
I'll be laboratory technician, cook, student. The whole works.
I see.
Well, it's one way of earning a master's.
And it's worth it working with people like Deemer and Prof. Jacobs.
- How well did you know Eric Jacobs?
- I've never met him.
He just read the paper and liked it, and that was that.
He's dead.
Died yesterday morning.
How?
Glandular condition called acromegalia.
Acromegalia? Isn't that a very rare disease?
Extremely.
Are you sure it was that?
No, I'm not sure at all.
He has a wonderful lab here.
One of the best.
Looks like nobody's home.
There must be someone. That's
Joe Burch's car over there.
Might as well.
The electric panel shorted.
And, well, you can see for yourself.
You estimated the amount of damage yet, Professor?
The greatest damage, of course, was to the work that was destroyed.
Let's get back to Jacobs.
- Why did he leave...
- I've told you all there is.
Will you gentlemen excuse me?
One more picture.
- Pat the monkey, Professor.
- I said that was all.
I think that ought to be enough, Joe.
- Professor's had a rough couple of days.
- Yes. Thank you, Dr. Hastings.
Thanks for the story, Professor.
I didn't mean to add to your troubles.
Come on, Ridley.
- See you later, Matt.
- See you, Joe.
I thought I'd never get rid of them.
You must forgive an old man.
- Have I met you before, miss?
- No.
This is Stephanie Clayton. It seems
Prof. Jacobs wrote for an assistant.
- She's it.
- Yes, Eric told me you were coming.
But I didn't expect to see a biologist that looked like you.
That was intended as a compliment.
- I'm afraid I've gotten a bit rusty.
- Well, thank you, sir.
Well, I don't know that you'll want to stay on with all that has happened...
You're welcome to, of course.
But Eric...
I know. Dr. Hastings told me on the way out.
I see.
Well, with Eric gone, I'm alone.
I'm sure I can be of service.
I mean, if you're going to continue with your work.
Yes, indeed. For Eric's sake, if nothing else.
Wasn't Paul Lund working with you, Prof. Deemer?
Paul...
Yes, he was studying for his doctorate... when I was a freshman.
- I'd heard he came here.
- Yes, of course.
Paul Lund. No, he's not with us anymore.
Well, come now, Miss Clayton.
Let me show you my lab.
- Are you interested at all, Doctor?
- Yes, of course.
I've put all I own into this.
It's my life.
Everything that I have and care for is here.
Unfortunately, part of it has been destroyed.
I see.
What's in the vial, Professor?
- A nutrient.
- You mean a synthetic?
A completely nonorganic food concentrate.
Medicine has lengthened the life span, and people live longer.
But the food supply remains fairly static.
World population is increasing at the rate of 25 million a year.
An overcrowded world.
That means not enough to eat.
The disease of hunger, like most diseases, well, it spreads.
There are 2 billion people in the world today.
In 1975 there will be 3 billion.
In the year 2000, there will be 3 billion 625 million.
The world may not be able to produce enough food to feed all these people.
Now perhaps you'll understand what an inexpensive nutrient will mean.
Well, not many of us look that far into the future, sir.
Our business is the future.
No man can do it on his own, of course.
You don't pull it out of your hat like a magician's rabbit.
Well, you build on what hundreds of others have learnt before you.
I thought that synthesis was impossible without a bonding agent... to hold everything together.
And we use the simplest of all: The atom.
Let me show you.
- That's an isotope, isn't it?
- A radioactive isotope.
Ammoniac.
- And that's what binds your solution?
- Binds it and triggers it.
Using it, Eric's dream and mine may be a reality before...
Excuse me.
Hello?
Yes.
It's for you, Doctor.
Thank you.
Hello? Hi, Josh.
Of course.
Call her back. Tell her I'll stop by on my way home.
Bye.
Sorry to break this up.
Thanks for the tour, Professor.
Maybe one of these days you'll invite me back.
Why, yes, of course.
Professor, I...
I'm still puzzled by the speed with which Jacobs' malformation developed.
Can you explain it?
Eric is dead and he shouldn't be.
But the cause was acromegalia. Nothing else.
It seems such a deviation from the classic cases.
You're being very diplomatic, Doctor.
Why don't you speak up?
Don't you think, sir, this time you might be wrong?
In this case, no.
You want to do an autopsy. Why don't you?
- Well, you objected.
- I was upset.
Eric was not only my colleague, he was my closest friend.
- You have my permission.
- Well, thank you, sir.
I'll let you know what I find.
And please, don't forget to invite me back?
- Well, now I'll show you to your quarters.
- All right.
- That you, Jack?
- How're you coming?
Be right with you.
What you got?
I'll give it to you fast, Jack. Nothing.
Nothing? You mean the professor was right?
Couldn't have been more right.
Well, how do you like that?
You make a big thing out of it, show
Deemer up for maybe a murderer and then...
You want me to go ahead with the interment, Jack?
You might as well before this amateur gumshoe gets any more bright ideas.
The case is closed.
And the next time I need a doctor,
I'll call one in from Phoenix.
You know, I don't think Jack's too happy about all this.
I don't blame him.
But I still can't figure it out.
Slowly, slow.
That's good.
Take your time, Steve, take your time.
We have nothing except time.
And we won't have that if we make a mistake.
There.
- Am I doing all right, Professor?
- Fine!
Now lift the lid onto the vial.
Easy.
That's it. Now lift up the graduated glass... and put it in the access chamber.
Well done, Steve.
Now lift up the chamber.
That's it.
Now we'll take this into the dry box... where we can handle it safely.
You're getting quite expert at this.
I don't know what
I'd do without you.
Now let's see how we make out.
It's one thing to develop a formula on paper, another to make it work.
So far we've found an almost consistent instability in the material.
One batch of nutrient varies sharply from the next.
What do you want to try it on this time?
One of the baby rats?
Okay.
How long before we know anything, Professor?
Well, there have been times when the instability has caused death.
I meant, if it works.
Let me show you.
- You see that rabbit?
- Yes.
How old would you say he was?
Four months.
Look at the chart.
Six days!
Is it normal?
I ran a reflex test on him after you went to bed last night.
The only difference between him and the others... is that he's healthier and stronger.
All the same, we mustn't be in too much of a hurry.
We've got to lick this problem of instability.
Once we can control that, we're ready for the ultimate test: On humans.
There mustn't be a mistake this time.
- I'll be back in a couple of hours.
- All right, Steve.
Science is science, but a girl must get her hair done.
You'd better hurry though, if you're going to catch that bus.
- It only stops on signal, you know.
- I know.
- Anything I can get for you?
- No, thanks.
We'll run those tissue tests when you come back.
- Right.
- Have fun.
Have the prescription refilled and be sure she takes it after every meal.
Okay, Doc, but you know women.
Mary will just let it sit on the shelf.
Yeah, but she'll feel better knowing it's there, won't she?
Yeah, I suppose so.
Say, when are you and me flying out for some more fishing?
- It's been four or five weeks since...
- Excuse me, Jim.
Steve!
- Carry your books, miss?
- Thanks!
I haven't been walked to school in a long time.
Hey, you dress up our town very nicely.
If you don't look out, the
Chamber of Commerce... is going to list you in their publicity with the local attractions.
Say, do you have to go right back?
No.
- Good, let's skip school.
- All right.
It's like an oasis.
- I bring all my patients here.
- I'll bet.
- How's this?
- Fine.
Not now, thanks.
How are you getting along with Deemer?
Half the time he doesn't know I'm there... and the other half he's worried I'll make a mistake.
- He's quite a guy, I guess.
- Yes.
Has he said anything more about that assistant that left?
No.
How's the nutrient coming along?
Well, this is the most amazing thing
I've ever seen.
How long does it take an ordinary rabbit to reach full growth?
I don't know. Four or five months, I guess.
He has one there that's reached maturity in six days.
Six days?
I know it sounds unbelievable, but it's true.
It's still so new and unpredictable.
There are all sorts of things to take into account... before we can even think of experimenting on humans.
Some of the nutrient, when unstable, has even been deadly.
But we do know that it's kept animals alive that have been fed nothing else.
If I stay here much longer
I'm going to miss my bus.
Who can ask for a better opening?
I'm at your service, miss.
Are you sure your patients can spare you?
I'm such a good doctor, they never get sick.
- Come on. Let's go.
- All right.
No wonder you love the desert.
It's so beautiful.
Everything that ever walked or crawled on the face of the earth... swum the depths of the ocean... soared through the sky has left its imprint here.
Look.
Did you ever wonder what piled them up like that?
Wind? Water? What?
I've never seen anything quite like it. Can we stop?
Sure.
All this was once an ocean, wasn't it?
You can still find seashells if you keep your eyes open.
- What's that?
- I...
- There he is.
- It scared me.
I'm beginning to see now why you love it here.
Catching, huh?
I think I'll have that cigarette now.
Thank you.
You know, it must look out of this world from the air.
- I'll show it to you sometime.
- Will you really?
What does it look like?
Like something from another life.
Serene, quiet, yet strangely evil... as if it were hiding its secret from man.
You make it sound so creepy.
The unknown always is.
- Whatever could have started it?
- I don't know.
Well, I think I've had enough of the unknown for one afternoon.
Something must have started it.
You can't second-guess the desert.
Rocks that have stayed for
1,000 years, they just move.
There's no figuring it.
Well, the bus would have gotten me here sooner, but I certainly enjoyed it.
- Give my best to the rabbits.
- Would you like to see them?
Now you're talking.
You can put them right there.
It's funny he's not here.
Maybe he's resting.
- Do I get the guided tour?
- Follow me.
It wasn't like that when I left!
Are you sure it's the same one?
Yes.
We injected a baby rat this morning. Let's take a look at it.
- This morning?
- It was a baby.
Matt, I tell you, this morning it was a baby.
And it doubled in size in a few hours?
Matt, you do believe me?
Of course I do.
Hello?
Yes, he's here. Just a minute.
It's your office.
Thanks. Hello?
Yeah, Josh.
I'll stop by on my way home. Thanks. Bye.
I've got to go.
That's one of the penalties of being a doctor.
I never seem to find time to finish a conversation.
What do you make of that baby rat?
I don't know.
Freaks of any kind give me the willies.
Well, I've heard of giantism, but
I've never seen it produced.
Why don't you have Deemer ask me out in the next day or so.
- I'd like to discuss it with him.
- I will.
Besides, it'll give me a chance to see you again.
Or don't I need an excuse?
- Now, what do you think?
- I'll call you.
My laboratory is not open to the public, Miss Clayton.
Explain why you brought
Dr. Hastings here.
- Sir?
- Dr. Hastings.
Will you please explain why you brought him here?
He's very interested in your work, sir, and I thought it'd be all...
Were you in the habit of conducting tours at Owens University?
No, sir, but I thought it would...
Bringing him here was a breach of my trust in you.
Experimental research is always confidential be it here or anywhere else.
You didn't tell me it was confidential.
I didn't think I'd need to.
Professor, your face.
- That will be enough, Miss Clayton.
- Yes, sir.
- Boy, you got nerves. Simmer down.
- Where did you come from?
I was on my way to old Andy
Andersen's when I saw your car.
What are you doing here?
There was a landslide an hour or so ago.
- Came back to see what caused it.
- This is one of those days.
Old Andy called me in a sweat and said to come a running.
Couldn't figure out what he was yakking about... but it seems like something was eating his cattle.
- Eating them?
- Say...
He had sunstroke a couple of years back. You don't suppose...
No, there must be something to it.
Said he had a stack of bones to show me.
You wouldn't like to come along, would you?
You still trust my judgement after the Jacobs business?
I ain't looking for medical advice, Doc. Just company.
Glad you finally got here, Sheriff.
Hi, Doc. Didn't expect to see you.
Hi, Andy. Jack met me on the way.
Told me you've been having trouble.
- Yeah, darndest thing ever happened.
- Where's what we came for?
Let's go.
I never saw anything like it.
No footprints, no blood, no sign of struggle.
The bones just stripped clean, like peeling a banana.
About noon the boy here came up from the lower section and found them.
I don't suppose it could've been mountain lions?
I've ranched here 22 years now, Doc... and I've had more than my share of lions and wolves.
It wasn't them.
- Where did that come from?
- It was there when the boy got here.
Stop worrying about that and tell me what's picking my cattle clean.
That's all I want to know.
What's doing it?
- Take it easy, Andy.
- They're not your cattle.
If it could happen last night, it could happen tonight, tomorrow night.
It could wipe me out.
Aren't you going to do anything?
I'm up a tree, Andy, like you are.
I don't know where to start thinking.
You got any ideas, Doc?
Better round up what livestock you can and stand guard.
If you see or hear anything, ring me at the house.
I'll be there, just in case.
See you, Andy.
Hi, Jack.
Anyone pull through?
You kidding? I want to show you something.
Morning, Doc.
The Sheriff tells me you've seen something like this before.
Yeah.
You buying this accident business, Doc?
- Aren't you?
- Nope.
I can't figure it.
There isn't a skid mark.
We ploughed through the wreck and found the brakes still work.
It's just like something grabbed the pickup and threw it 30 feet off the road.
Take a look at this, Doc.
I can't understand why I didn't spot this stuff... when I hauled those skeletons out of here and stacked them on the other side.
- They were here?
- Yes, sir. Why?
There doesn't seem to be any distinctive odour.
Wow.
Say, have you got a thermos or a jar around here somewhere?
I think there's one over here.
- Same stuff we found at Andy's?
- Yeah, I think so.
Well, that makes three then.
Three?
Here, the stuff you saw yesterday, and Andy's.
Andy?
His wife found him at the corral last night, dead.
He'd been... Like the cattle and sheep.
There was a couple of gallons of this liquid beside him.
I wish you'd give me a hand with this yarn, Doc.
Stuff here I can't handle.
Maybe there's stuff here none of us can.
If I were you, Joe, I'd write this as a straight accident.
If you print anything as vague as what we've got... you'll scare half the state to death.
- News is news, Doc.
- Guess and a half-truth aren't news.
Why don't you hold off till we nail this down tight?
Maybe then you'll have the biggest story of your life.
- What have you got, Matt?
- I don't know.
But we've got to keep our minds open and our mouths shut till we do know.
Here you are, Doc.
Thanks.
Well?
I'm not sure.
It's impossible at this stage to give you a positive answer.
But it's related to insect venom.
- Insect venom?
- Come off it, Matt.
I know. But it checks.
Acidic content, the whole works.
I'm not sure what kind of insect venom it is, but...
Look, Matt, I'm willing to play ball with you... but there's a limit to what I'll swallow.
Check it yourself, Joe.
I'll show you how.
You're having nightmares, Doc.
There's not an insect in the world with that much venom.
All right, don't take my word for it.
Get someone else to analyse it.
- Who?
- Prof. Deemer.
Hey, that's a good idea.
I'll make a date with him.
Take the stuff out. Okay?
Okay.
- This time don't you forget to let me know.
- I won't, Joe.
Insect venom in the large economy size. I've heard everything.
Give me Prof. Deemer will you, Josh?
Hello?
Hello, Matt.
No, I can talk. He's upstairs.
I was hoping you'd call. There's...
Matt, I've got to talk to you.
Well, he's sick,
Matt, terribly sick.
It's his face and his hands.
Yes. Well, I did.
I asked him to see a doctor, but he won't do any...
Steve? Steve!
She hung up, Doc. You want me to try to get her back?
Hurry, Matt!
- Are you all right?
- Something's happened.
He can hardly breathe!
Steve, get me some water, will you?
Don't you think we ought to get him to a hospital?
There isn't anything they can do for him we can't do right here.
Give him some water, Steve.
There's nothing you can do, Doctor.
- Don't say that.
- Nothing anyone can do.
Start with Jacobs, Professor.
He was the beginning.
Eric and I spent every waking hour on this ever since our... days at Oakridge.
But he was an impatient old man.
He was convinced that... an occasional failure with the animals... didn't necessarily mean... that the nutrient would fail with humans.
Then... one day when I was in town... he and Paul... injected themselves.
When did Jacobs inject himself, sir?
Four days before he died.
Acromegalia developed in four days.
The isotope triggered our nutrient into a nightmare.
Then...
Paul went crazy and attacked me.
While I was unconscious, he made sure that I wouldn't survive.
But I... continued the experiment... hoping that in the short time... left to me, I'd be able... to prove the... nutrient... would work.
You should have seen them.
You should have seen them.
You should have seen them before the fire.
They lived on nothing but our nutrient.
A rat eight times normal size.
A guinea pig big as a police dog.
A tarantula...
Lost, all lost.
What about the tarantula?
Burnt.
All burnt.
Let's take him upstairs.
- He'll sleep for a while.
- Is there any hope?
Here's something to relieve the pain.
Give him one when he wakes up.
Where are you going?
Well, the tarantula...
There's something I want to check on.
I'll phone you when I get back.
- Just set it up, Jean. Then you may go.
- Yes, sir.
Well, that was a pretty accurate analysis you made, Doctor.
Then it is insect venom?
Well, not precisely. It's from a species called arachnida.
- A spider?
- Well, a tarantula, to be exact.
But I've never seen venom in such quantity before.
You know, there's more venom in this test-tube... than you'll find in 100 tarantulas.
You mean a tarantula that could secrete that much venom, would be...
100 times larger than normal?
At least that.
What would you say, Doctor, if I told you I found pools of that venom?
Four and five feet across, two to three inches deep?
I'd say you'd been having a nightmare.
Or that you're the biggest liar since Baron Munchausen.
It's a nightmare all right, Doctor... but not the kind you mean, and I'm not lying to you.
- The tarantula film is ready, Professor.
- Thank you, Jean.
Now look, I know you didn't fly
200 miles just for a joke... but I simply can't believe all you're telling me.
- Good night, Professor.
- Good night, Jean.
Well, under the circumstances we might find this interesting.
That's the largest of tarantulas, from South America... and it's only a foot in diameter with its legs outstretched.
I know. Our Arizona species is even smaller.
That's right. Not more than three inches in size.
Now there it is, coming out of its burrow.
It's got eight legs and can move faster than you think... which assures him of a long life.
As long as 25 years sometimes.
That's the spider wasp... the tarantula's deadliest enemy.
See? The wasp usually wins... but don't count on it, because the tarantula doesn't know the meaning of fear.
As you can see, he'll back down a rattlesnake if he has to.
See?
They're flesh eaters, aren't they?
Yes, and desert beetles are their usual diet.
Those powerful jaws are strong enough to pierce a man's finger.
There. The venom is paralysing the victim.
Tarantulas predigest their food by flooding the wound with a powerful solvent... so that the flesh can be sucked into the body.
That would account for the bones.
Dr. Hastings, your imagination is showing.
So that's it, Doctor.
- How deadly is the venom?
- Not deadly at all.
About as poisonous as a hornet's.
No fun, mind you, but harmless.
The few deaths that have been reported are the result... of germs entering the wound at the time of the bite.
- You make them sound like pets.
- Not pets, Doctor.
Just part of the world about us.
We must accept them as we do the rest of God's creatures.
Each has a function in its own world.
But what if circumstances magnified one of them in size and strength?
Took it out of its primitive world and turned it loose in ours?
Then expect something that's fiercer... more cruel and deadly than anything that ever walked the earth.
How about Dr. Hastings' call to Desert Rock?
I'm afraid I won't be able to get it for you.
The lines are down between
Calamite and Desert Rock.
Be about an hour before they can resume service.
- How'd that happen?
- I really don't know, sir.
Do you want me to try again in about an hour?
No. Never mind. Thanks.
Here you are, Jeb.
Going to be a murky night.
Yeah.
Do you think that was lightning we saw over to the west?
If it was, it's the first time I ever seen lightning throw off sparks.
Maybe one of them college boys short-circuited his nice new Geiger counter.
What was that?
- I'm at the airport.
- Oh.
- Can you hear me now?
- Yeah, yeah.
Jack, we haven't much time.
I want you to round up every available man. Arm them...
Do what? What are you talking about?
Jack, do as I say.
Notify the State Police to meet you at the Deemer place.
Notify the State Police?
You must be drunk.
No. I haven't been drinking.
- All I want you to do is...
- I know. Just call the State Police.
Please, Jack. Believe me.
All right, I'll do it.
Thanks. I'll see you.
He's coming, Matt, I can see it!
There's Matt's car.
- What's it all about?
- Jack, turn the cars around!
- What for?
- There isn't time. I'll tell you later!
Lieutenant, look!
Jumping Jupiter!
Get those submachine guns!
You boys, get back in the car.
They won't stop it!
Matt, if it follows the highway, it'll come right into Desert Rock.
- Doc, keys in your car?
- Yeah.
Doc and Miss Clayton are coming with us.
Get in. You boys, try to slow it down.
- If you can't, take Doc's car and follow us.
- Yes, sir.
- Come on. Start it, man!
- I can't start it.
Come on, you'll flood it.
That is correct.
You've got at the outside 30 minutes to get everybody out. Over.
Desert Rock will be cleared in 30 minutes. Over.
Do you think dynamite would stop him?
Get a truck over to Murphy's, load up all the dynamite he has.
Bring it just north of Devil's Rock.
We'll be waiting for it.
Yeah, dynamite might work.
But what if it doesn't?
You got any other suggestions,
Doc? It'll be light soon.
If we could get a message to the air base at Sands.
How are you going to do that?
- Somebody could phone from town.
- Unless the lines are down.
Sergeant, I want you to phone the commanding officer at Sands Air Base.
Any special instructions, Doc?
Yeah. If the boys have some napalm, tell them to bring it along.
Sergeant, tell them to load up with napalm, rockets, anything they've got.
Hurry it up, boys!
- That's the last of it, Mr. Murphy.
- That's it, Joe.
There isn't another stick of dynamite in the whole town.
Here. Prime them on the way.
- See you later, I hope.
- You will.
All right. Let her roll!
Don't forget to prime them!
Pull her right in here, boys!
Pull her in here.
Right across the road. Come on!
Lend a hand, boys!
Watch it now! They're all primed!
Where do you want this dynamite?
- Across the road.
- Shake it up, boys! Lend a hand!
Watch it now! Put the boxes right down there across the road.
All right, let's go.
Come on, boys. Get them down here!
- All right. Here we go.
- Come on, get that dynamite down here.
All right. Beautiful.
- Do you think it will work?
- Dynamite's tricky stuff.
It may blow it up. It may just blow the highway up.
Doggone, I wish we had some nitro.
I'll have to see that tarantula before I believe it.
You'll see it, Joe, and you'll wish you hadn't.
Let's go! Get those wires hooked up.
Here he comes!
Holy cow!
Come on! Get back!
- Let's go!
- Come on.
Get this truck turned around!
Let's go!
Hold it!
We've gotta hurry it up.
Hurry it up.
I got it.
Steady.
Now!
Let's get out of here.
What now?
- I don't know.
- We got to do something.
Biggest story of my life and I won't get a chance to write it.
Look!
Look, here they come!
Look at them!
All right, Betts. Fire two rockets on this first pass.
Here goes.
Dropping napalm. Follow in order.
Dump them all.
How was the take tonight?
Not bad, Mr. Hennessy.
- Almost 20 grand.
- Good.
Tell the boys I'll be with them in a few minutes.
Mary, for deposit tomorrow.
142 one hundred-dollar bills,
100 fifty-dollar bills, the rest five, 10...
I told you I'd come back.
Remember Buchanan?
Why, you're not Buchanan!
I don't look like him but I am him.
Don't you recognize the voice, Jim?
I promised to see you die and I will.
- Hey, boss, what's the matter?
- Hey, boss, let us in.
- Hey, boss, what's the matter?
- Hey, boss, let us in.
Hey, boss.
Come back home. Come back home.
Get in the automobile.
Get in the automobile.
The automobile.
Get inside!
Turn on the ignition.
Now, drive home.
He got hit when they shot at him.
He might not be able to make it.
If his brain is still receptive, he can be directed.
Well, what if it isn't? What if their bullets hit one of the brain electrodes?
As long as he has an ounce of liquid in his veins, he will return home.
I've told you, these creatures automatically try to return to their source of feeding when their energies run low.
Well, your creature's helped us get rid of the first one.
I'll see them all die before I'm through.
Oh, if I had only known when you first offered to help me financially.
Dr. Steigg, if it weren't for my money, you'd still be experimenting with cats and dogs in that flea-sized lab of yours in Europe.
I made it possible for you to prove your theory with human beings.
That is true.
But my theory was to use these creatures to help people live by doing everything that was difficult and dangerous.
You just want to see people die.
Not just people, Steigg. Particular people.
And I'll get them. Every single one of them.
And after you do?
What?
There'll be nothing we can't do or have.
Nobody'll be able to stop us.
Can't you keep him going any longer?
No, I can't keep them breathing longer than a few days, then the glands deteriorate.
They just disintegrate.
Is he dead?
He never was alive.
Different parts of the body die at different times.
My next problem is how to keep them working as long as the heart is beating.
Does the brain still die first?
Always.
The brain always dies first.
- Why aren't you boys home in bed?
- Hello, Dr. Walker.
I gave him exactly $19,821.
All right, wait outside, will you, please?
- Oh, hello, Chet.
- D.A.
- Hi.
- Hi, Dave.
- What does it look like?
- Your guess is as good as mine.
- Robbery behind it?
- Yeah, it could be.
Yet whoever did it left over 60 grand in the safe.
Maybe he didn't want to get into a higher bracket.
Oh, brother.
How did he get it?
How didn't he get it?
The neck's been broken and also his spine.
Just by twisting it.
The murderer must have had the strength of an ape.
Hennessy's guards saw him.
Said he looked like any other man.
Don't tell me he bent these bars?
That's what Hennessy's boys say.
The killer came in and got out that way.
Well, I'd hate to meet him on a dark night.
- Bullet holes, huh?
- Hennessy's boys shot at him.
Hit him, too. Look at the trail of blood.
We found some blood on the road.
You know, there's something screwy about this whole thing.
He must've been hit bad to lose that much blood, yet he made it to his car and got away.
Well, whoever it was, was certainly careless. These fingerprints are perfect.
- That's strange.
- What is?
Turn out the lights for a minute, will you?
- See it?
- Yeah.
The fingerprints are luminous.
Yes, and the footprints and the blood.
Turn on the lights again, huh?
What do you make of that?
I'm a district attorney, not a chemist.
Ask Chet.
- What about it, Chet?
- I wish I knew.
Let's take this back to the lab and make a test on it.
I'll send the fingerprints to Washington.
Maybe they can trace them there.
- Don't let anyone in there.
- Have you any idea who did it?
- Was it robbery?
- What's the inside on this?
Got nothing to say now, boys.
Doctor, how did anybody break through those bars in there?
Maybe he ate all his vitamins.
Vitamins?
Look, a diluted solution of hematin.
Two absorption bands between the Fraunhofer lines.
Oh, cut the double-talk, Chet, and break it down to plain English.
Take a look. This so-called blood is a chemical composition.
It looks like a bunch of crystals to me.
Exactly. There are crystals in that concoction.
Now, what do you mean "concoction"?
Here. I'll show you.
Adrenaline, sodium hydroxide and blood sugars.
Throws the beam to the right dextrose.
No hemoglobin traceable.
No hemoglobin? Then it isn't blood.
Right. Like I said before, it's a chemical composition.
Here, I'll put it in the centrifuge and we'll see what else it's made of.
Well, why is that stuff luminous?
That's right, why is it luminous, Chet?
Just as I thought.
This so-called blood is highly radioactive.
- Dangerously so?
- Plus nine.
Is that a lot?
Enough to kill a man if he's exposed to it long enough.
Well, that's about all we can do for tonight.
Let me know when you hear from
Washington on those fingerprints.
Well, what'd you find out?
Yeah, how about giving us a lowdown on this?
Yeah, give us a lead, will you?
- You want the truth?
- Yeah.
All right, then, according to the evidence,
Hennessy was murdered by a creature with atom rays of superhuman strength.
And a creature that cannot be killed by bullets.
Creature?
You don't expect us to believe that?
- No.
- Big joke.
Just for that I'll misspell your name.
I don't blame them.
I don't believe it myself and I was with you.
Dave. Come on in.
- Where's Chet?
- Sleeping.
Sleeping? At this hour?
Yes, at this hour. 7:30.
Well, don't blame me, Joyce.
I didn't ask him to be a cop.
Get him up, will you? it's important.
- Where's Penny?
- Having breakfast.
Uncle Dave.
Well, how's my little sweetheart this morning, huh?
I feel fine, Uncle Dave.
There's some coffee in there, Dave.
Thanks, I can use it.
Well, Penny and me are going to have a little tête-à-tête, aren't we, huh?
I never tasted a tête-à-tête before.
Chet.
Chet.
Chet, wake up.
Chet, not now!
- Name a better time.
- Dave's here.
Oh, he can wait till I kiss my wife.
Chet, he'll hear us.
So what? We're married.
But he's not.
Well, then let him find out what he's missing.
Chet, he says it's important.
Important?
About that murder last night?
Yeah, must be.
You didn't tell me anything about it.
I don't believe in talking shop when I'm home.
You'll probably read all about it anyway.
And when you do, you won't believe it.
I'll tell him you'll be right out.
Oh, this door sticks.
Remember, Mrs. Walker, you had your chance.
Come on, open up.
Tell me a story first.
It's too early in the morning for stories.
I always tell a story to my dolly.
- Do you like her?
- Oh, I'm crazy about her.
- What's her name?
- Henrietta.
Henrietta?
I used to go with a girl named Henrietta.
What happened to her?
What happened to her shouldn't happen to your doll.
She married a con man.
That's not the kind of a story to tell kids.
- Hi, Penny.
- Hello, Daddy.
Hurry up, Penny. You'll be late for school.
Come on.
Atta girl. Goodbye now.
Goodbye, Daddy.
- Goodbye, Uncle Dave.
- Have fun, Penny.
That's the story of a cop's life.
"Hello, Daddy. Goodbye, Daddy."
What's up?
You'd better sit down first.
I just came from the Bureau.
They checked the murderer's fingerprints.
His name is Willard Pearce.
They let me have it from the files.
Petty theft, fraud, three months in prison, tubercular...
How could a tubercular man have strength enough to break those bars like that?
You think that's something?
Answer this one.
How could a dead man have strength enough to do it?
Deceased?
Yeah, and I used to think
Scrabble was tough.
When did he die?
Well, according to that, 24 days ago.
Oh, that doesn't make sense.
You're the smart one.
If it doesn't make sense to you, imagine how it sounds to me.
Have they got a file on this guy?
Yes, I copied it.
"Died of asphyxiation on the 22nd of last month.
"Body delivered to the city morgue.
"Copy of coroner's report was attached."
Have you checked with the morgue?
I got two of the boys doing it now.
Does MacGraw know?
I called him at his home.
He told us to meet him at his office.
Hello.
Oh, yes, he's here.
For you, Dave.
Yes? Be right over.
Remember that cylinder we took out of Hennessy's Dictaphone?
- Yeah.
- Like to hear it?
- Sure.
- Come on.
Bye, Penny.
- Now perhaps we can all relax for a little...
- Bye, honey.
- Call you later.
- Chet, you didn't have breakfast.
- Nope.
- Chet, it's not healthy to...
Goodbye, Joyce.
What are you doing in here?
I'm from Buchanan.
If you know that, you know why I'm here.
It's no use, MacGraw.
I said I would live to see you die.
I am watching you now.
Come back home. Come home.
Come back home.
Mary, for deposit tomorrow.
142 one hundred-dollar bills,
100 fifty-dollar bills, the rest five, 10...
I told you I'd come back.
That's when the Dictaphone was knocked out of his hand or he dropped it.
Anyone recognize that voice?
I do and I don't.
I just got a feeling that
I've heard it before.
Well, it'd be hard to place it anyway, but the killer's voice sounded more mechanical than Hennessy's.
- Did you notice it?
- Yes, it's like a...
Like a recording of a recording.
"I told you I'd come back."
Not much to tie onto there.
Well, could've been some big loser who swore to get even or some gambler he rousted around.
Anyone and anything.
Anyway, there's no doubt that he bent the bars and came in through the window.
We could hear the sound of the glass crashing.
Listen, MacGraw must be waiting for us now.
Yeah.
Oh, but if that's the D.A., tell him we're on the way up.
Hello. Yeah.
MacGraw?
MacGraw was found in his garage, murdered.
I'll meet you down there.
I want to pick up some equipment first.
Okay.
Looks like the same job pulled on Hennessy.
- Did you find any prints?
- Plenty.
I asked the Bureau to call me here as soon as they get a line on them.
- How long has he been dead?
- About an hour.
It must have happened just as he was getting ready to go to the office.
Who found him?
His wife. She's in the house now.
I had to give her a sedative.
Take him away, boys.
Captain Harris, I can't figure this one.
His jaw's broken. Neck, too.
It wasn't a weapon.
The bruises look to me as though they'd been done by a fist.
But MacGraw was a husky guy.
I've never seen a case where a man's neck was broken by the sheer force of a grip.
Why should anyone want to kill MacGraw?
Well, he was a district attorney.
A lot of guys must have hated his guts.
MacGraw's enemies were usually friends of Hennessy's, and yet they were both killed in the same way and by the same person or thing.
Thing?
How about a statement, Captain Harris?
About time we had something official.
As soon as we have something to say, we'll say it.
Do you tie up MacGraw's murder with the Hennessy murder?
Not until we know more about it.
You're wanted on the phone, Captain.
It's in the house.
Geiger counter?
I want to check the car for radioactive emanations.
Emanations?
Say, Dr. Walker, didn't you find radioactivity in the Hennessy killing?
Well, then that would connect the two murders, wouldn't it?
Well, yes and no.
It's not a conclusive fact.
Just an approach.
That story you gave us last night about a creature charged with atom rays,
-it's on the level then, huh?
- I told you it was.
Hey, we had a scoop and didn't know it.
Let's get out of here.
It was the Bureau.
The prints belong to a Vernon Dunn.
He died a few weeks ago.
And that's not all. Get this.
The boys just checked the morgue.
Eight bodies have disappeared.
Call the inspector and tell him I want to talk to him as soon as possible.
And ask him to have the Mayor there and the commanding general of this military area.
General?
We're going to need all the cooperation we can get on this one.
How do you do, ladies and gentlemen?
This is Dick Cutting with today's commentary on the news.
Well, as you know, today's big story hinges around the killing of District Attorney MacGraw, whose body was found today in his garage, murdered in much the same manner as Hennessy was.
What connection the murder of MacGraw can possibly have with Hennessy, a gangland boss, is unknown at present.
Dr. Chet Walker of the police laboratory has given out a fantastic story, so incredible that one can lend it little credence.
Dr. Walker is of the opinion those crimes are being perpetrated by dead men.
Yes, I said dead men, restored to life in some unknown manner by being charged with atom rays, which give them superhuman strength and makes them impervious to bullets.
Well, if you want to believe that story, you can...
This Walker must be a pretty smart cookie.
He has imagination.
The kind of imagination that may prove dangerous to us.
You mean the kind of imagination that could prove dangerous to him.
About time to feed them, isn't it?
Hello, Walker. Captain. Mayor Bremer.
General Saunders.
This is Captain Harris and Dr. Walker.
Walker's in charge of our lab.
I hope, Dr. Walker, you've called us here to assure us the stories about dead men walking our streets is only a hoax.
I wish they were.
What did you find out about those bodies stolen from the morgue?
Well, according to the records, they were to be cremated.
They were placed in coffins and delivered to the city crematory.
May I ask how this concerns me?
You can be of great help to us, General, as I'll explain in a moment.
But first, I'd like to give you and the
Mayor a picture of what's been taking place so that you can understand exactly what we're up against.
Couldn't those bodies have been stolen by some of those creatures on or before arrival?
Well, they could've. But that wouldn't explain them coming back to life.
What makes you so sure they were alive?
What makes me so... Well, they were walking around, weren't they?
It says you found fingerprints.
You yourself said those dead people committed the crimes!
Yes, those are the facts.
But I'm afraid we'll have to depart from our usual approach to get anywhere on this case.
I wish, Dr. Walker, you'd make yourself a little clearer.
Well, let me give you a very primitive example.
Do you remember Faraday's experiment with a frog's leg?
I flunked Chemistry One three times.
I remember Faraday's experiment.
Good. Then you'll remember that Faraday applied energy, in that case electricity, to the leg which had been severed from its body.
It moved.
Frog legs. I don't see the parallel.
People of that day wouldn't believe that the leg of a dead animal could move, but Faraday proved it.
We know why.
Yes, now we know why and take our knowledge for granted.
In our case, which is as mysterious to us as Faraday's was in his time, we found traces of energy.
Energy which would increase the strength of any animal tremendously.
Radioactivity.
Well, you've lost me.
All right, Chet. What you're trying to do now is throw away everything we've learned so far about life and death and start from scratch.
And just how do you propose to do this?
Well, we have certain clues.
One very definite one.
In both of the murders, radioactive emanations were found.
Now that's where you come in, General.
We'll have to find the source of these emanations.
Now I want to use Air Force planes and trucks equipped with instruments which can track down that source.
I'll see that you get the trucks and I'll call Colonel Roberts at Monroe Air Force Base about the planes.
He'll give you all the cooperation you need.
We'd certainly appreciate that.
Tell him I'll be down to talk to him at, say, 3:00.
Goodbye, Dr. Walker. Good day, gentlemen.
Of all things to happen under my administration.
Keep me posted on this.
And suppose we do find the source?
Then we'll be able to find the cause.
That car in front. Get it. Wreck it.
Drive into it.
What's he doing at the airfield?
Better wait and find out.
It may concern us.
Come back!
Stop.
It's you!
Well, who did you think it was?
Don't tell me strangers are in the habit of...
I was wondering if you'd be home in time for dinner.
That's not true, Chet.
Is it?
Better hide it from Penny.
- But how can I hide a thing like...
- Please, Joyce.
I'm tired and I'm hungry and I'm...
Frankly, I don't know how.
I don't know any more about it than it says right there.
Look, how are we fixed for a nice, cold martini?
Coming right up, Chet.
Penny's outside playing.
Well, what about it?
Well, is it safe?
There seems to be some sort of a definite pattern.
Can't put my finger on it, but I do know that Hennessy and MacGraw were killed for a reason.
Well, it's all right then?
Well, for a while.
I don't think they've gotten around to indiscriminate killings yet.
Yet?
- Hi, Daddy.
- Hi, Penny.
Where's the paper, Mommy?
I want to read the funnies.
Oh, it didn't come today, dear.
Oh, then I'll put on the TV.
- No, Penny.
- It's broken, Penny.
We'll have to have a man over to fix it.
Yeah.
Look, why don't you play with Henrietta?
She's a bad girl and I'm punishing her.
Well, did you spank her?
I put her in her bed and told her she can't look at TV all week.
You're a tough one, you are.
Thanks, honey.
I've been looking forward to this all day.
I'll go.
Hello, Uncle Dave.
Hi, Penny. How are you?
Oh, it's you.
Oh, you don't seem particularly happy to see me.
There comes a time in every woman's life when she'd like to be alone with her husband, if only for a few minutes.
How come you never got married,
Uncle Dave?
He'd be a bigamist, Penny.
He's already married to your father.
- Want a drink, Dave?
- No, not while I'm on duty.
Well, I'm not on duty.
You will be when you hear what I've got to tell you.
Penny, will you please go to your room?
Why? I didn't do anything.
I know, dear. it's just that Daddy and Uncle Dave want to be alone.
I won't bother them.
Go to your room this minute, Penny.
All right. But I always let you listen when I talk to Henrietta.
Okay, let's have it.
Look, I'm not a child.
And this is my house.
You're not going to put me out of it.
The only time my wife talks is when I'm ready to go to sleep.
All right. I'll get dinner.
Remember you said this morning that you were thrown because Hennessy and MacGraw were both killed in the same way and by the same thing yet they were always on opposite sides of the fence?
- Yeah, what about it?
- Well, that worried me, too.
So I checked back on both of them and found that they were on the same side of the fence, once.
- Well, when was that?
- About 10 years ago when you first came into the police lab.
Hennessy and MacGraw helped convict Frank Buchanan.
Buchanan.
The name rings a bell, but not too clearly.
Buchanan was a top mobster around these parts.
He practically ran the city.
When MacGraw became D.A. he took out after him.
Well, where does Hennessy come in?
Well, Hennessy was Buchanan's number-two man.
He wanted the number-one slot, so he turned on him.
Oh, yeah.
I remember something about it now.
Wasn't Buchanan shipped off to Europe?
That's right.
He got five years and deportation.
I don't get the connection.
Listen to this.
I got it out of the newspaper files.
"No sooner was sentence pronounced
"than Buchanan leaped to his feet, screaming to MacGraw,
"'I'll get you for this.
You and everyone who squealed on me.
"'I'll come back and see you die, every single one of you!"' Get it?
That voice on the Dictaphone.
"I told you I'd come back."
That's right.
That's the first thing I thought of, too.
- Yeah.
- But you just said he was deported.
I'm not saying it's him, but it's a lead.
It's the only connecting link
I could come up with, why any guy should want to kill both
MacGraw and Hennessy.
Did you check with the authorities over there?
Well, I cabled them and just got this answer.
"Frank Buchanan, resided in Rome.
Via Lucullo, Number 11.
"House vacated.
Left no forwarding address."
Well, he could still be anywhere in Europe.
Well, I cabled the chief of police in Rome.
Asked him to investigate further and cable me as soon as he had a line on him.
Were there any others who helped convict Buchanan?
Two others who were in with him and the fellow who was the Assistant
District Attorney, Lester Banning.
He's now in private practice.
Think they should be warned?
I'm having the boys round them up now.
They should be in my office any minute.
Well, let's go.
What about dinner?
Oh, keep it warm, honey.
I'll be back in an hour or two.
- Sorry, Joyce.
- I'll bet you are.
One for the road?
Oh, not now, dear. I'm back on duty.
- Oh, nice to see you, Mr. Banning.
- Thank you, Captain.
This is Dr. Walker, head of our crime lab.
- Doctor.
- Banning.
And this is Jason Franchot.
He used to be Buchanan's accountant.
And Dunn here used to be his gunsel.
- I don't like that word.
- Paid killer. Like it better?
Look, I've been traveling straight and I don't know what
I was brought here for, but it's a bum rap.
I want to see a lawyer.
Now tell me, Captain, what's this all about?
I called you here to warn you that your lives may be in danger.
Is Buchanan back?
What makes you say that?
First Hennessy then MacGraw.
He said he'd get us.
But I didn't know he was back in the country.
His sentence wasn't changed.
How could he be back?
If he's in this country, he's here illegally.
Now if you take my advice, you'll all go to jail for protection and stay there until we can find out whether it's Buchanan or not who's behind all this.
Not me. I worked too hard to get out of jail.
- It's for your own good.
- Think my wife would believe that?
She'd think I went back to packing a rod.
What about you?
I have a good business now.
Tax auditor, public accountant.
If I went to jail, my reputation would be ruined.
I don't think it's necessary, Captain.
Particularly since there's no proof that Buchanan is back in this country.
All right. But I am going to give you protection 24 hours a day no matter where you are. Got that, Tom?
- Right.
- Have some of the boys drive them home.
Now if an attempt is made to get any one of them next then we'll know for sure.
It'll complete the pattern.
It's the hard way to find out.
This is from the chief of police in Rome.
"Attention, Captain David Harris."
"...in lab operation, who also has disappeared.
"If find any additional information, will advise.
"Rome Chief of Police."
Dogs, cats, monkeys.
That's the way experimentation usually starts.
Starts?
It's only one step from animals to human beings.
Captain Harris sent me to relieve you.
A little early, but why complain?
And with the murder of Jason Franchot last night I must apologize for my recent skepticism regarding these radioactive creatures.
It seems they do exist and they are prowling the street.
Police Chief Camden assures us that they are doing everything in their power to get to the source of these beings.
With the cooperation of the military, planes and helicopters equipped with radium finders are now overhead, and strange-looking trucks similarly equipped are now at this moment prowling through the streets of our city to track them down.
Excuse me, please.
A glass of beer, please.
Thank you.
Hey, you forgot your change.
This is a sawbuck.
Two bits in the till, $9.75 in my pocket.
Now that's what I call a tip.
You from Water and Power?
Five point two.
What's this all about anyway?
I'm probing for radioactivity.
Is there uranium around here?
I'm going to call my lawyer and find out if I own the mineral rights.
- Who was sitting here?
- Search me.
He went out the back way.
- Do you know who he is?
- Never saw him before.
Hey! Don't wash that glass.
He never washes them anyway.
He leave anything else here?
No.
Just this.
This 10-spot hot?
Hotter than you think.
This is an international who's who of the medical profession.
Here's what it says.
"Wilhelm Steigg, born in Stuttgart, Germany, in 1893.
"University of Berlin, Zurich, Milan.
"1948 Harman Prize for his research in amygdala stimuli."
Amygdala stimuli, what's that?
Ultra-short wave stimulations to specific parts of the brain, producing involuntary movements of the body.
- That's highly specialized stuff.
- Yeah.
A number of stories have been published about amygdala stimulation of monkeys.
Here's one of them.
Appropriations have been made for research and development, and there's a doctor in Madrid who's made great advances since this article was published.
Have you been conducting any experiments here at the hospital?
No. But I have a short film that I told you about.
Would you like me to run it?
- I'd appreciate it.
- Fine.
Draw the curtains, will you?
This animal looks content, doesn't it?
You wouldn't suspect that it has
18 electrodes inserted in its skull.
Turning this switch releases a small amount of ultra-short waves.
Those electrodes are tuned to specific frequencies.
As long as the impulse is released, the dog barks.
By applying another impulse of different frequency, the dog immediately falls asleep.
It will lie there as long as the stimulus is active.
Another impulse will make it vicious.
Docile.
Hunger can be induced.
Or it can be made to resent its food.
Amygdala stimulations, somatomotor and visceromotor effects.
Does this demonstration satisfy your curiosity?
Almost.
Try my special mixture.
Thanks.
This experiment was done on live animals.
Of course.
Do you think it could be applied to dead ones?
Dead ones?
Offhand, I'd say no.
The command impulse is so small, less than a millionth of a watt, that only the animal's body energies could supply the reactions.
If you could replace the body energy from an outside source, say, with radioactive energies, do you think you'd get the same results?
Well, your question is much too abstract to be answered at this moment, Dr. Walker.
Do you think an experiment on humans would have the same result as on animals?
We haven't arrived at that stage of our experiment, yet.
Could it be possible that somebody else has tried and already succeeded?
Are you trying to connect the experiments with animals with mysterious events of our city?
It would answer the riddle, wouldn't it?
Remote-controlled creatures, their brains powered by atomic energy, roaming the streets, directed from a central point.
Utterly fantastic.
Yes? Yes, he's here.
It's for you, Doctor.
Yes? Oh, yes, Dave.
Send the glass and that bill over to the lab at once.
That bird must be radiating in the dark.
I don't understand how he can stay alive with all that radium poisoning in his system.
German accent, huh?
Better have them search every house within a 10-block radius.
Letting them get that close to you.
What did you ever leave here for?
The pain, the pain in my hand was killing me.
If I hadn't gotten some medicine to relieve it, I would have gone crazy.
From now on just hide in here.
With the walls and the shutters leaded, they'll never find us.
I'm not so sure.
Those creatures, they leave radioactive traces.
Sooner or later they will be picked up.
The planes, how low they're flying.
Oh, I think it was a mistake not to get rid of that Walker when we had the chance.
It's a mistake we can remedy easily enough.
I'll stop them.
I'll make them ground every plane and pull out every truck looking for us.
Go in there and fix up that stoolie.
I want to send one of them out.
And you feel certain it's Buchanan who's behind all this?
For my money, it is.
Killing Franchot completed the pattern.
What about those other two,
Banning and whatever his name is?
Who, Dunn? We put them in the county jail.
They'll be safe there.
It's the first time that gunsel ever begged to be put into jail.
He was scared stiff.
He isn't the only one.
- Yes?
- Call for you, sir. Personal.
The party says it's important.
Hello. Yes, this is Chief Camden.
You will stop all planes and trucks searching for radioactivity.
I will give you until 3:00 this afternoon to do this.
If you do not, many people will be killed exactly one hour later.
Who is this? Who is this?
There will be no other warning.
Hello? Hello? Hello?
They hung up before
I could put a tracer on it.
It was a warning to withdraw all our planes and trucks equipped with radium finders by 3:00.
Or else.
What do you mean "or else"?
He, or whatever it was, practically threatened mass murder one hour later.
What did the voice sound like?
Sort of mechanical.
What do you think, Dr. Walker?
Could he, or they, or whatever these creatures are, could they do this thing?
There's no definite knowledge as to what they can or cannot do.
Then they must be stopped.
- How?
- Well...
Our only chance is to find their source.
But if we pull back all the planes and trucks we'll never find the source.
Give into Buchanan now and there's no telling what he'll ask for next.
You think they're bluffing, Chet?
They could be, but I doubt it.
Captain, alert the entire force. Put every available officer on duty at 4:00.
I wonder just what they're trying to do.
We'll find out in two hours.
As Governor, I am declaring a state of emergency.
All police facilities have been alerted to protect us against any further crimes by so-called atomic creatures.
The state militia will assist in patrolling all traffic.
All scheduled transportation shall be canceled until further notice.
If you must go outside, have identification papers with you.
The radium-finding planes and trucks will continue to operate since this is our best hope of locating the source of these beings.
Do not be alarmed as we are confident we will soon pinpoint the origin of these emanations.
All possible measures for your safety are being taken...
I think we'd better dismantle the panel right now and get out of here while we can.
Not till I'm finished.
There are two more yet, to say nothing of that bright boy, Dr. Walker.
But you don't even know where they have hidden Banning and Dunn.
Walker'd know.
- If we got him...
- Why, as a creature, he would have no memory. You know that.
He's a cop, isn't he?
We can use him to get the information for us.
Bring one of them out, right now.
Oh, hey, Dave, will you do me a favor and take my car over to the lab?
Have one of the boys take the Geiger counter out of the trunk.
- It needs a little adjustment.
- All right. You can drive mine home.
- Thanks.
- I'll bring it back in the morning.
Okay.
Hey, what's the big idea?
Identification.
Oh, yes. Of course. I forgot.
Franchot.
Hand me the scalpel.
I think we've made our first real mistake.
- A dangerous mistake.
- I don't think so.
What will you use Captain Harris for?
The same thing I was going to use Walker for.
He's a cop, too, isn't he?
Get him in shape as fast as you can.
- Is he ready?
- Yes.
Let's take a look at him.
Come in.
Closer.
Stop.
Why doesn't he see us?
What's wrong?
Look at us.
See how the selen cells transmit the image the creature sees on this screen?
And with him I have actually succeeded in stimulating the muscular impulse of the larynx so that I can activate him to speak.
- With his own voice?
- Yes.
Let's hear it.
Make him say something to me.
What do you want him to say?
His name. And make him look at me.
Look at him.
Say, "My name is David Harris.
Captain Harris, Homicide Squad."
My name is David Harris.
Captain Harris, Homicide Squad.
Steigg, you may be a crackpot, but you're also a genius.
I think we can finish up all our unfinished business by tomorrow.
I'll go.
Penny! Ask who it is first.
Who is it?
I am Captain Harris, Homicide.
It's Uncle Dave.
Why so formal?
"I am Captain Harris, Homicide."
Hello, Uncle Dave.
Daddy isn't home.
He just left.
I'm baking a cake for Penny.
It's her birthday.
I'm seven today, going on eight.
Excuse me, will you? My cake will be ruined.
Gosh, your hand is cold.
Sit down, Uncle Dave. I want you to see what Mother got for Henrietta.
See? She got a new dress, panties, socks and shoes.
Don't you think they're beautiful?
What's the matter, Uncle Dave?
Cat got your tongue?
Where is your father?
I don't know.
Ask your mother.
Mommy, Uncle Dave wants to know where Daddy is.
He went to see Chief Camden, Dave.
Something about those two men involved with Buchanan.
Those two you're keeping in the county jail.
What are their names again, Dave?
You know who I'm talking about.
- Banning and Dunn.
- That's it.
You sound terrible, Dave.
Are you sure you feel well?
Penny, keep away from him.
He may be coming down with a cold.
Here. Hold Henrietta for me.
It's time to feed her.
Chet had a brainstorm this morning, Dave.
Something about giving out phony information as to where those two men were hidden.
He thinks Buchanan will send out one of those creatures to kill them and then you can capture him.
But he'll tell you all about that when you see him.
Penny, what are you looking for?
Where's Henrietta's bottle?
Here is it.
Now please stay out of the kitchen.
I'm busy enough as it is.
Mommy!
Penny! Penny!
Mommy!
Penny, baby, what's the matter?
- Honey, what's the matter?
- It's my dolly!
I told you I'd make use of him.
They were going to trick you with false information.
We're about to pull a neat little trick ourselves.
Tell him to hurry up.
Faster. Faster.
Dr. Walker's trying to locate you, Captain.
He said to get in touch with him immediately.
This is 13-F-1 calling from frequency two.
Inform Dr. Chet Walker that
Captain Harris is at the county jail.
KMA 3-6-7.
Oh, Captain Harris.
Glad to see you again.
Yeah. We're getting tired of looking at one another.
How long do we have to stay holed up here?
Being with him is like being in solitary.
Well, if we can judge by the progress the police are making, we may as well resign ourselves to spending the rest of our lives together.
That may not be as long as you think.
What's wrong, Captain?
Captain, you off your rocker?
I'm Frank Buchanan.
You're cracked! You ain't Buchanan.
You're Captain Harris.
I am Buchanan.
I told you I'd see you die.
Hi, Dave!
Joyce called me. Why in the world did you...
Hey, Dave. Wait a minute. What's the rush?
We got Walker.
For Pete's sake, Dave. What's eating you?
Slow down, Dave.
Attention all cars.
Lester Banning and Tom Dunn found murdered in county jail.
Police Captain David Harris, suspect.
Proceeding south with Dr. Chet Walker in yellow convertible.
License number 27H4926.
Dave? Did they... Oh, no.
Proceeding south with Dr. Chet Walker in yellow convertible.
License number 27H4926.
Smash up that car. Smash it up.
Did the car crash?
It must have.
Then both are dead.
Only one can die, Mr. Buchanan.
- Dr. Walker, you all right?
- Yeah.
Have Chief Camden rush a helicopter to pick up Captain Harris and take him to the city hospital.
Yes, sir.
And tell him to have Dr. Norton stand by.
Right.
Muscular movement extremely strong.
Extra-ocular reactions missing completely.
Reactions similar to those of animals subjected to strong amygdaloid stimulations.
Got that?
Thank you.
The X-rays of the skull.
These will bring us a few steps closer to the solution.
Will you follow me to my office, please?
Doctor, stay here and let me know should the patient's condition change.
Amazing.
What are the small protrusions on end of the dark lines?
Electrodes.
As you see, they are grouped in patterns.
Every one is connected with an amygdala circuit.
You used that word before.
What does it mean?
The small lobes projecting from the underside of the cerebellum.
All our body movements originate from there.
These nerves stimulate muscular impulses.
That's how the body gets orders from the brain.
Muscular impulses?
The larynx is a muscle, isn't it?
We certainly move it by muscular contraction.
That's why those creatures are able to talk.
If the right stimulation activates the amygdala circuit, they will speak.
There is no question about it.
But they're not aware of what they're saying.
They are not aware of anything.
Those disks in front of the eyes are selen cells.
What makes you think so?
Electric impulses produced by light.
They could very well be transmitted back to...
Well, let me call it a receiving station.
What would that mean?
If the image on the retina could be transmitted then someone would be able to witness whatever this creature is seeing on a screen.
But that's impossible.
- Look here.
- What is it?
You see? A few of the very fine wires have been broken loose.
That's why the creature is impassive.
He's moving. He's trying to get away.
We can't get through to him.
See?
Some of the electrodes must have been broken when he had that accident.
The oscillograph doesn't register the impulse.
His eyes are open.
- Does he see us?
- I don't know.
Don't go closer in case the selen cells can still transmit light images.
Maybe you can lead us to them, Dave.
Maybe you could... it's just a hunch but I think he's trying to return to his source of energy.
Look, see how he turns, as if trying to find a certain direction?
Watch it!
Let him go. I'll follow him in the helicopter that brought us.
Tell your men not to interfere with Captain Harris if he takes a car,
-even a police car.
- Right.
Let's hope he leads us to the source before his energy runs down completely.
Try to contact him.
If he has any energy left at all, he will return to replenish it.
The radium in this tube, wherever he is, this will attract him like a magnet.
Captain Harris leaving hospital area.
Patrol car 557 passed
First Street heading north. Over.
Camden! Come in, Camden!
- This is Camden.
- I can see 557.
Have your men keep out of his way.
He can only see what is in front of him, clear?
- Over.
- Clear.
Over and out.
Take her down.
Fly about 500 yards behind 557.
Patrol car 557 passing Third Street area.
557 turned onto foothill proceeding south.
Caution them to follow and not interfere.
Will advise when 557 reaches destination.
Over.
Place located at end of Westholm
Boulevard. Notify all aid. Over and out.
Okay, set her down.
In a little while, the police and soldiers will be here.
Come with me.
I've had enough bloodshed.
I will not let you commit any more.
Oh, yeah? Try and stop me.
A life of work.
But I'll destroy it first.
I'll bring up some incendiaries, burn the place down.
No! There must be radium in there.
A fire would burn off its protective lead shield.
Yes, once the radium is exposed, the gamma rays might spread over the entire city.
Then we can't even blow open the door or the windows.
It would be too dangerous to try it because of explosion.
Come in.
Come in.
Go out and kill them.
Kill them.
Look.
Good grief. Look at them.
Those are the bodies that were stolen from the morgue.
Kill them. Kill them.
The bullets have to sever the electrodes to stop them.
Incredible.
With the last ounce of energy remaining, he's still trying to reach the source.
Are you all right?
Well, I wonder what we've got here.
Look at that, a birthday present from Uncle Dave.
Isn't that pretty?
Oh, but isn't he coming?
No, no. I'm afraid he'll have to be away for a while.
Why? I'm not mad at him anymore.
It's not that, Penny. it's business.
Look, Penny, why don't you name your new dolly Henrietta the second?
No. I'm going to call her Dave.
Dave? Dave's a boy's name.
That's a girl doll you've got there.
I don't care.
I know.
I'll tell all my friends she's a tomboy.
Well, guess that ought to do it, huh?
All right, Penny.
See if you can blow these out now.
Here, Daddy, hold Dave for me.
All righty.
Take a deep breath now.
Get ready.
Come on, blow. Come on.
- There.
- Wonderful, Penny.

Councilor! Councilor! Councilor!
Councilor! Councilor!
How disgraceful!
Calm yourselves.
Councilor... this is an urgent matter!
Tend to those two at once.
Yes, Sir!
- Hang in there! - Keep a hold of yourself!
- Hang on! - Stand steady!
Lord Kira?!
EDO MANSION OF THE ASANO CLAN
EDO MANSION OF THE ASANO CLAN
Stop fretting, Gengoemon. Kira Kozuke no Suke holds the fourth rank at court.
Stop fretting, Gengoemon. Kira Kozuke no Suke holds the fourth rank at court.
If anything, offering him a bribe now would be disrespectful.
But, My Lord, many Daimyo have already suffered at his hands.
For instance, Matsudaira Totomi no
Kami and Honda Yamato no Kami...
...were shamed deeply by Lord Kira, and bloodshed was only narrowly avoided.
This is about a ceremony to welcome...
...both the Imperial Envoy, Great Councilor
Yanagiwara, and Mid-Councilor Seikan'in.
If people heard that someone from the Asano Clan...
...had bribed Kira, not only would it go against my family's customs...
...it would be an inexcusable slight against the Imperial Envoy!
Yes, My Lord, but Lord Kira's behavior in the palace yesterday...
...was absolutely outrageous!
Enough! Don't say any more, Gengo.
Go and prepare for my visit to the palace.
["Gengo:" Short for "Gengoemon."]
Thank you, Lord Kira.
It is all thanks to you...
...that yesterday's welcoming ceremony went so perfectly.
Nonsense, Lord Date. Unlike Lord Asano, you are attentive in all things...
...and you take in everything
I say with good grace, so it's a pleasure to guide you.
Please, feel free to consult me at any time.
You have my humble thanks.
Lord Kira, I humbly request instruction on how to best attend the Imperial Envoys.
You should have some idea how to do that without me telling you every little thing.
Do what's proper.
But I am ignorant and unschooled in the manners of court nobles...
...and the Council of Elders has told me to seek your guidance in everything.
Well, if you insist, I suppose
I can spare a word or two.
Gifts are vital to official functions.
Gifts?
Yes. You must treat the Envoys with esteem.
You should give them gifts every day.
I understand.
Also, please tell me what I should do regarding the replacement of tatami mats at Fukoin...
...where I'll be entertaining them during their visit to Zojoji Temple.
Oh, there's no need to go to such lengths.
Lord Tsuchiya Sagami no Kami is the presiding Elder this month.
I asked his steward, who told me that whatever Lord Kira may have said...
...daily gifts would be both preposterous, and regarded as quite rude.
In fact, it's never been done.
We must merely spare no effort to properly entertain them.
So it's as I thought.
How dare he play me for a fool!
Was he just pressing for a bribe?
My Lord, this weighty task is almost upon us. Please, just endure until then.
Oh, don't look at that.
That gift's from a hick Daimyo who struts around...
...talking about Bushido in this peaceful Genroku era! Toss it out.
But, My Lord, he did go to the trouble.
Wouldn't it be best to at least examine it?
These days, one must often forget Bushido and adopt a more flexible approach.
I know what the typical Asano family gift is like without having to look.
I shall examine it, then.
I see... I can just picture the haughty look on Asano's face.
See? I told you not to look.
First last night, then tonight... we have never seen you like this before.
My Lady is worried that your current state duties are causing you great distress.
There's no need for concern.
Everything is going smoothly, thanks to Lord Kira's instructions.
No need to fear.
Now, pour me another...
You have not been looking well.
Please be mindful of your health until this ceremony is over.
It's not something I'm used to, so I'm just anxious not to make a mistake.
I'm sorry I worried you.
Oh, what nonsense.
We are family!
My Lord, Chief Retainer
Yasui Hikoemon...
...requests an audience with you, about an urgent matter.
What? You say Asano asked the Elder about gifts to the Envoys?
Yes. Date Sakyo no Suke's Chief
Retainer just sent word.
Did he say I'd told him to give gifts?
I'm told that, from observations of their conversation, it seemed so.
Damn that Asano...
What is this "urgent business"?
My Lord, according to what Horibe and Maebara have heard, the Date Clan have just finished... replacing all the tatami mats in the room where they'll host their guest...
...during his visit to Zojoji Temple.
What?! They replaced the tatami?! Damn that Kira, he's made a fool of me again!
There is no way we can replace
200 tatami mats in time...
...to pass the inspection tomorrow morning, My Lord!
We won't?!
My Lord, we'll get it done by morning even... if we have to round up every tatami weaver in Edo!
Please don't worry.
That hick of a Daimyo...
We have to finish this by morning!
I'm counting on you all!
- What time is it?
- 11 PM, My Lord.
And there's no word from Gengo?
None.
Lord... won't you try to get some sleep?
You go on to bed ahead of me.
- How many left?!
- Another 40.
We're almost there!
I'm counting on you all!
Oh, My Lord!
What is it?!
All the tatami mats have been replaced.
My thanks...
My deepest thanks!
My Lord!
Yasubei, I thank you.
Sir...!
You are certainly blessed,
Lord Asano. Bravo.
Lord Asano.
Lord Asano!
If you require something,
I'll be happy to serve you.
The likes of you would not understand!
Lord Asano, what is this?!
Look at this screen!
If there is some problem with it, please tell me.
You fool! It's inexcusable to use a screen...
...with an India ink painting in the
Envoys' pilgrimage lodgings!
I'll wager you're just making do with whatever was lying around the temple!
If you weren't well-off, that would be one thing...
...but someone as rich as you should at least have a new screen made!
Are you really that much of a penny-pincher?
Lord Kira, I must ask you to...
Enough!
It must be a headache having such hick samurai as your vassals, Lord Asano.
My Lord! My Lord...
Please wait!
I am grateful for your instructions.
At the ceremony for the reply to the Throne...
["Long Kamishimo," "Eboshi Daimon:"
Two types of formal samurai dress.]
...should I wear a long kamishimo?
Or should I wear eboshi daimon?
["Long Kamishimo," "Eboshi Daimon:"
Two types of formal samurai dress.]
["Long Kamishimo," "Eboshi Daimon:"
Two types of formal samurai dress.]
A long kamishimo should be fine.
You should know that much!
We just have to endure this for one more day. Be patient!
"We have been hearing of Lord Kira's behavior for some time..."
Kuranosuke...
I thank you for your concern.
It sounds like a most sympathetic and encouraging letter.
Remember, after today's ceremony, your work will be done.
I pray you will get through your duties for this one day.
Don't worry.
All right. Tonight, regale me with your stories.
I know what to do.
Set your mind at ease.
My Lord, what's the matter?!
Gengo, I've been duped.
Everyone's dressed in eboshi daimon for this ceremony!
I've made a terrible mistake!
Have no fear. We have your formal dress all laid out.
What?!
We brought them, just in case of this very mistake.
Gengo... Gengo!
Thank you so much!
Toda.
Yes?
My Lord said we need only endure for this one day, correct?
The Imperial Envoys have reached the Nakasuzume Gate!
Lord Kira! The Envoys will enter the palace any minute!
As their host, should I greet them on the raised platform... in the entryway, or down by the door?
Please, tell me! Please!
Lord Asano, you're incorrigible.
You must be well aware of the answer.
Are you mocking this old man?
No, not at all! Please, help me!
Have you lost your mind?
You're serious, aren't you?
Lord Asano, it's absurd for you to be asking such questions, today of all days!
Lord Kira!
You're within the palace.
You do know that?
You mean to kill me, the Kozuke?
Fine, you just try it!
If you unleash that sword from its scabbard one tiny bit...
...your land is gone and your family name is history.
If that doesn't bother you, sure, go right ahead!
What's the matter, Lord Asano?
You insolent fool!
Please forgive me.
I bow in humble apology for my blunder!
Please, please instruct me!
Lord Asano.
When the Envoys' audience with the
Shogun is over, please let me know.
His honored mother,
Lady Keishoin, is eager to visit with them and inquire after their health.
I understand.
I am not sure what you need,
Lord Kajikawa...
...but if you have any questions, please allow me to assist you.
This hick of a Daimyo couldn't help... he doesn't know a scrap of etiquette!
Hold it right there, Kozuke!
Now you'll pay!
What are you doing?!
Let me go!
Let me go!
Are you mad?!
This is the palace!
Let me go! If you have any warrior spirit in your soul, let me go!
["Ninjyo:" Lit., "wounded by sword." Drawing a sword in the palace was a very serious crime.]
Bloodshed! Blood! Bloodshed!
Bloodshed!
Bloodshed!
Bloodshed!
Bloodshed!
["Metsuke:" A Shogunate Inspector who investigated important crimes, including corruption and treason.]
I, Metsuke Okado Denpachiro, am making a formal inquiry.
First, tell us the circumstances behind this incident.
["Takumi no Kami:" Lord Asano's formal title.]
Why did Takumi no Kami draw his blade?
You must have done something.
My Lord, I am only an old man.
I cannot remember doing anything to cause
Lord Asano the slightest grudge.
Also, because we are on palace grounds, and particularly in view of the occasion...
...I tried to dodge him instead of parrying.
Now I have wounds even on my back.
I beg you to intercede with the Shogun for me.
You say that you have done nothing to offend him?
Exactly. I cannot understand his attack at all.
My Lady, something horrible has happened.
To my Lord?
Yes. He drew his sword against Kira Kozuke no Suke...
...in the Pine Hall of Edo Palace.
And Kozuke?
Is he alive?!
Silence! If you were in your right mind, why would you have done this?
There must be no falsehoods in your written submissions to this court.
"I, Takumi no Kami, suddenly drew my sword in a fit of madness."
You, write that down.
Please, wait.
I am deeply grateful for your mercy in leaving me my 53,000-koku of land.
However, I am the Lord of Ako Castle.
If my official reason is that I lost my senses, I will be a laughingstock.
The truth is that I drew my sword against Kozuke...
...because I could no longer hold back my resentment.
Tamura Kyodaiyu, presenting myself here on your orders.
The Shogun has instructed me,
Dewa no Kami, to convey his decision.
This morning, Takumi no Kami caused an uproar in the palace that showed...
...disrespect, both to the court and to his duty as host to the Imperial Envoys.
Therefore, the Shogun considers his actions a great outrage.
He commands that Takumi no Kami immediately travel to Lord Tamura's estate...
...and once there, commit seppuku.
- Seppuku?
- Yes.
And what of Kozuke no Suke?
Well... the Shogun considers it laudable that Kozuke no Suke...
...honored the court and restrained himself, out of consideration for the time and place...
...even though he faced mortal danger.
Therefore, he is to receive no punishment, and his wounds are to be treated.
Lord Takumi no Kami is master of a castle controlling 53,000-koku in income.
I fear that the decision for him to immediately commit seppuku...
...has been made too hastily.
It is the Shogun's order!
Wait!
With all due respect, if he testifies that he attacked because of a personal grudge...
...we cannot be certain Kozuke no
Suke's behavior was correct...
...without closely investigating the nature of the animus.
Above all, after my initial investigation, there are several matters that are not yet clear.
Lord Okado, are you protesting the Shogun's decision?
I am a Metsuke.
To uphold the law of the land, when I feel that a decision may not be universally accepted...
...I must venture to offer my counsel.
Silence! The Shogun has already given his order.
Please, wait.
Since Lord Ieyasu's time it has been the rule that both parties are to blame...
...for quarrels within the palace.
If Takumi no Kami is to commit seppuku...
...I believe Kozuke no Suke should face some punishment as well.
If nothing else, a few years ago, other Daimyo...
...such as Matsudaira Totomi no Kami and Honda Sado no Kami...
No more! Do you oppose the Shogun?!
Restrain yourself!
The chief coroner,
Shimousa no Kami...
...and Lord Okado Denpachiro, the Metsuke, have arrived.
What's the meaning of this?! No other
Daimyo ordered to commit seppuku...
...has ever been forced to do it in the garden!
And this "crime" Takumi no Kami has committed is hardly...
Lord Yanagizawa consulted the
Shogun out on the matter...
...and was told to punish
Asano as a criminal.
["Ometsuke:" Shogunate Chief Inspector who handled investigations involving Daimyo and senior officials.]
Hold on! Is it proper for an Ometsuke to simply do as Lord Yanagizawa desires?
Restrain yourself!
Remember where you are!
Lord Asano, it's time to prepare yourself.
A vassal of Takumi no Kami, Kataoka
Gengoemon, has just arrived.
Gengoemon is here?
He requests a brief audience with the Lord.
No one will be allowed to see him.
I allow it!
Send him to the garden.
Yes, sir!
My Lord...
My Lord!
My Lord!
Gengo?
My Lord...
It was good of you to come.
If I may carry a message to anyone, it's...
It's the least I can do!
Even just one sentence!
When you see Oishi in Ako...
...just tell him I am consumed with remorse.
My Lord...
I will tell him without fail!
This is goodbye.
My Lord!
Leave.
I will pass it on.
"The wind carries away... the cherry blossoms...
...yet I grieve more... for the passing of spring itself."
"I grieve more... for the passing of spring itself."
Quiet! We are asking you all how far you're prepared to go.
How does refusing to give up the castle show our devotion?
I don't see how we'd be showing loyalty to our dead Lord...
...by defending this castle, when it will make his merchants and farmers suffer...
...and bring down disaster upon his family and all their relatives!
What are you talking about?!
We won't set one foot out of this castle!
It would be a disgrace to the honor of Ako!
Shogunate regulations specify that both parties...
...are to blame for fights within the palace!
Now that they've trampled on that rule, honor forbids us from handing over this castle!
But if the Shogun has decreed it, we have no choice but to obey!
Seeking even more suffering would be disloyal to our Lord!
Arguing any more is pointless.
All those who agree with
Ono should leave now!
Yes, we should!
Men, do you understand what I'm saying?
If you let momentary passions make you stay here, it'll be fatal!
Do you want to add another treachery to the list?!
First of all, isn't it odd that
Councilor Oishi isn't here?!
Silence! Councilor Oishi is hoping for responsible behavior from us all!
There's no need to pretend.
All of you who agree with Ono... begone!
The passions of the moment will become treachery!
Traitors!
I'm no traitor!
Traitors!
Traitors!
Councilor, this is a letter written in blood...
...from those vassals in Edo who have sworn to live or die with you!
Councilor!
We are all prepared to die to defend this castle.
You attest that you're resolved to defend the castle...
...even if the Shogunate brands you rebels and traitors?
You need not even ask!
"NATURALLY, EVERYONE WAS EVICTED FROM
THE ASANO FAMILY'S CITY RESIDENCE."
The Metsuke is here to make his inspection! Hurry up and leave!
Wait! Wait, wait, wait!
I just want to say a word of greeting to Lord Okado.
No! Your time is up! Get out!
No! Your time is up! Get out!
- Wait! Wait!
Okano, stop!
Stop it.
Stop this commotion!
Lord Okado, I'll express my deep gratitude for your consideration...
...during our master's seppuku, and then I'll take my leave.
I know how you must feel, being chased out like stray dogs.
Then I would like to ask you one question.
Yes?
Does Lord Kira still live?
What?
I beg you...
I beg you, please tell us.
His life is in no danger.
Now leave.
Sir...
We evicted his retainers from the
Edo residence without incident...
...but many in Ako, led by their councilor, Oishi...
...seem prepared to defend the castle to the death.
I trust there were no problems deploying
Honda and Matsudaira's troops to Ako?
None whatsoever.
Wakizaka Awaji no Kami is prepared for that as well, so if worst comes to worst...
...we'll break up the whole castle and clan, and confiscate everything.
This should put all those country
Daimyo in their places.
APRIL 17TH
APRIL 17TH
I was eager to go down in glory, defending this castle to the death...
I was eager to go down in glory, defending this castle to the death...
...against those coming to take it.
I feel some regret that I cannot.
It is easy to die a glorious death in battle, but it would cause trouble for the people of our fief.
Yes, I am sure that to quietly follow our Lord is true loyalty.
Today we see Ako Castle for the last time.
Emoshichi! You have a sick father to look after.
You mustn't die here.
With all due respect, Councilor, please look at this.
My father despaired that he could not help the Asano Clan in its time of need...
...so he... he...
He took his own life?
Yes.
I want to join him, and go to meet our dead Lord!
No! You haven't come of age yet.
I won't allow you to rush blindly into death.
Councilor, if you refuse because
I am not of age, then what of Chikara?
Why can he participate?
Why do you refuse death only to me?
Emoshichi, well said!
We both aim for the same thing!
Yes!
Father, please allow Emoshichi to follow our Lord into death!
Wait! Wait, wait, wait...
C... Councilor!
Kazuemon?
I have been a ronin for the three years since I angered Lord Asano...
...and now I will never have the chance to gain his pardon!
I have come here so that I can at least seek it in the afterlife.
Whether I slept in the fields or the mountains at night...
...not a single day has passed when I didn't pine for my master!
I, Kazuemon, have prepared myself.
I beseech you...
Please let me follow my dead Lord!
I beg you!
No. I can't believe you would ask to follow my Lord to death...
...when he was still furious with you!
I will gain his forgiveness in the afterlife!
Emoshichi, don't let him beat you!
Right!
Councilor, prepare yourself.
Wait, men.
We're canceling this seppuku!
- What?!
- What?!
First you ask us to defend the castle to the death...
...then today you decide we're following our master...
...and now you call off our seppuku?!
It's heartless! You can only mock a man so much!
My Lord has faithful retainers.
I think...
...he must surely...
...be pleased right now.
Yet Kira Kozuke still breathes!
APRIL 18TH
Kuranosuke, your surrender of the castle was truly remarkable.
Every detail meticulously accounted for, from the first bow to the last pair of sandals!
You've quite impressed me.
I beg you with all my heart...
...to appoint my late master's younger brother, Lord Daigaku, as his heir.
If only all retainers were like you!
NAMEPLATE: "KIRA"
So they peacefully surrendered the castle, eh?
Oishi may be a wise man, but he couldn't think his way out of that one! Excellent, excellent.
Father, they say Oishi petitioned for Takumi no Kami's brother, Daigaku, to succeed him.
What? Such insolence!
I'm told that the Shogun's anger at Takumi no Kami was extreme.
I imagine he wouldn't dream of allowing the succession.
Obviously not!
This is the end of the Asano line!
But we don't know what his ronin in Ako and Edo will do.
My Lord, you must be very cautious, as they must be seeking vengeance against you.
W... What do mean, vengeance?
Hyobu!
Father was the one who was cut, and the Shogun ordered the seppuku!
They have no right to seek
"vengeance" against me!
If there's any target for revenge here, it's the Shogun!
Those hick samurai won't understand that.
Don't say that!
Oishi is the wisest man in Ako.
I believe extreme caution is necessary.
And the brilliant way in which he handled the surrender of the castle...
...has everyone in government saying how clever he is.
He didn't even defend his castle with his life! What can he do?
Rumor has it that Oishi bought a huge estate at Yamashina in Kyoto.
Then we can't be too careful.
Make sure you keep watch on that place at all times, from inside and out.
All these hick samurai know how to do is draw their swords at the drop of a hat.
I can't believe you,
Lord Awaji...
...letting that hick councilor, Oishi, talk you into bringing me such a petition.
I have to say it seems a little childish.
No, Oishi is a truly admirable person.
And I thought a bit of benevolent governance would mute any public criticism...
...that ordering Takumi no
Kami's seppuku was unjust...
...in view of the
"both sides at fault" rule.
Lord Awaji, I am the
Shogun's grand chamberlain.
I can't bring him a request that would conflict with his wishes!
I understand, but I am told this incident has all of
Edo speaking ill of the government.
I feel it's worth bearing in mind.
I'm shocked that even you, the head of the Elders, would say such things!
If you rate Oishi's abilities that highly, you should hire him.
How dare you!
Lord Yanagizawa,
I think you're crossing the line!
YAMASHINA
Welcome home.
- Welcome home, Father!
- Welcome home, Father!
Who is this?
I am Okahei; I have an introduction from Sir Den'emon.
Ah, you look like a strong young man.
You've been tired day and night...
Are you sure you're not having a little too much sake?
I understand you're leaving for Edo soon.
If it should affect your health...
Father.
Where's Chikara?
He rushed off to his uncle's for something.
Is this trip to Edo about the request for Lord Daigaku's succession?
It seems like everyone in
Edo is tired of waiting...
Edo, eh?
It's been three years...
EDO
Move it!
It's Lord Kira.
Check out the showy procession!
Acting all important just because
Lord Yanagizawa backs him.
Lord Asano of Ako sure got the raw end of the deal.
Yeah, but Lord Kira's the one whose head is gonna roll!
Sir, I, err...
Never mind, just come with me.
You may dress like a townsman, but
I won't tolerate that look in your eyes.
Sir, I promise you
I'm no one suspicious.
Come on.
Where on Earth are you taking me, sir?
Strange how fate keeps bringing us together.
But you'd never get Kira like that.
What do you mean?
This "Kira" person you...
Silence.
You're... Lord Okado!
I remember meeting you when
I cleared out your master's home.
You have my most sincere thanks for your consideration that day.
Is this a plan of Kondo Nobori no Suke's estate?
I'm sure that Takumi no Kami is pleased, in the next world, as he watches...
...his men work so strenuously and tirelessly at the risk of their own lives.
I can't stop seeing the moment of his seppuku in my mind.
We have not yet toiled enough.
There are those who have said goodbye forever to their wives and mothers.
The estate on that map is empty right now.
You should reconnoiter it now, while you can.
Who... what are you saying, my Lord?
You're a poor imitation of a townsman.
Any halfwit could tell you were a samurai in one glance.
Sir, you look ill.
What's the matter?
Something troublesome has happened.
The Kira household is being moved from Sukiyabashi to Honjyo.
And to the old home of that ruffian
Kondo Nobori no Suke!
How do you explain that?
Well, you're obviously asking me after you've already come to a conclusion.
I suppose it's because if the ronin of
Ako did attack Lord Kira's estate...
...it would be too close to the palace for comfort.
You think so too?
If we assume this to be true, then as long as Lord Kira is not near the palace...
...the Shogun will not officially notice our security measures.
But sir, do you really think the ronin of Ako will risk everything to attempt their vengeance?
What do you think?
I understand this "Oishi" is highly regarded.
I would say this is because he has the public's sympathy.
He and I differ there.
But hasn't it been six months since
Takumi no Kami drew his sword?
If they meant to kill Lord Kira and were willing to die for it, they've already had chances.
Fine, fine.
Rui... eventually I'll have a job for you to do.
I hear Oishi is coming to Edo soon.
I have no idea what he'll do.
We must be on our guard.
NANBUZAKA, RESIDENCE OF YOZEN'IN
This is the first time I've seen you since my late husband's seppuku.
I can't help but cry.
My Lady does nothing but worry about the troubles our vassals must face...
...now that they've left the fief.
All those who would scatter have scattered.
Now if young Lord Daigaku could just receive an estate of even 10,000-koku...
Kuranosuke!
Your late master cast away 53,000- koku to attack Lord Kira.
Surely you have not forgotten.
Otaka, Yoshida, Horibe and his son, and the other prominent vassals...
...who remain in Edo sometimes visit me...
...and they tell me they've all placed themselves in your hands.
You could carry out my Lord's will whenever you had a mind do.
With all due respect,
My Lady...
Are you suggesting there is a spy in this house?
I believe my visit here is known to...
We are told you've been buying up farmland in Yamashina...
...and have so lost yourself to wine and women that this is your first visit to Edo.
Is this a ploy to deceive our enemy?
Toda! Don't scold him.
I am sure Kuranosuke has his reasons.
I am Oishi Kuranosuke, former retainer at Ako.
It'd be most bothersome if you mistook me for someone else.
This is absurd!
Identify yourselves!
Since you refuse,
I assume you know who I am.
I suppose I have no choice but to fight.
He's tough!
Idiots!
I won't allow such violence!
Lower your swords. Now!
There will be no violence on the doorstep of Metsuke Okado Denpachiro!
Retreat! Retreat!
I cannot thank you enough for intervening.
No need, Oishi.
But you are unfamiliar with Edo.
Happily, one of my regular merchants...
...is just returning to Nihonbashi;
I'll have him show you home.
Hey!
Sir?
Oh, it's you!
I never dreamed I'd find you in Lord Okado's home.
Councilor, it's you!
I haven't seen you since our master's seppuku.
When I heard you were in Edo,
I went to your inn...
...but they told me you left this morning without telling anyone where you were going.
I was worried. It's very dangerous to walk around unescorted.
Sir, Lord Okado did me an immense kindness...
...concerning Kira Kozuke no
Suke's move to Honjyo.
Oishi, the townspeople have already caught wind of your visit to Edo.
Edoites are quick to jump to conclusions...
...and there are already rumors that the time for vengeance at hand.
Even a Metsuke cannot control the tongues of the masses...
...and so I thought it best to mention this to you.
Ah, then I must have caused you a lot of trouble.
After I petition for Lord Daigaku to succeed his brother,
...I'll be returning to
Kyoto immediately.
Keep back!
Why so flustered,
Lord Shimizu?
- Where's the chief councilor?
- He's in the bath right now.
I've done something terrible.
What's the matter?
I must apologize to him immediately.
So you didn't manage to kill Oishi?
What? You knew about that?!
The ronin we hired foolishly attacked him right on Metsuke Okado's doorstep.
Oh no, for him of all people to get involved...
Was anyone hurt?
Two were cut down.
Is Oishi that talented?
I trust you made sure there is no evidence of our involvement?
This Oishi is no ordinary man.
He shouted at the top of his voice at us, asking if we knew who he was.
Now, we can't have you, of all people, afraid of him.
I received this map from Lord Okado...
...several days before Kira switched lodgings.
Thanks to it, I was able to inspect every nook and cranny before he moved in.
And I was able to open a trinket shop right in front of it.
This has been of great help to our comrades, sir.
And now that we are fortunate enough to have you in Edo...
...we'd like to settle things within the next couple of months.
Sir, over time, even those who once doubted us have come to see what's right...
...and by the time you left Kyoto, there were over 120 names on our blood compact.
Bushido has not yet died out!
This many people raiding Kira's mansion would be truly magnificent!
Sir, if you're carrying the blood compact now, please show it to us.
The blood compact!
Our scroll isn't here!
Where is it?
Why don't you keep them together?
We are comrades!
I'll do it after Lord Daigaku's succession is decided.
Sir, we pledged our lives in blood.
I cannot understand this.
Sir, don't you believe in us?
Of course I'd like to believe.
"Like to"?
Don't you understand how your comrades feel...
...bearing all their pain silently for the sake of their revenge?
Yoshida, and all the rest of you, you should try to stay away from Yozen'in's house.
Why would you say that?!
What happened to me tonight is an excellent example.
Rui, you will go to Kyoto.
Me, sir?
You are the only one who can do this, Rui.
Am I to spy on Oishi?
Is he an unworthy opponent?
No...
Heihachiro is already in Yamashina.
Oh, my...
Are you telling us to endure silently until
Lord Daigaku's succession is decided?!
You're asking for a lot of patience!
What'll we do if the old bat dies?!
I'm a full eight years older than Kira.
I can't afford the luxury of time.
Don't you understand the pain those of us in Edo have felt all this time?!
My late master...
I can still picture the moment of his seppuku.
I'm ashamed of my weakness!
Father, why don't the two of us go and kill Kira then?!
Wait!
Do you still not understand what's in my heart?
Behind our enemy Kira, there lurks Lord Yanagizawa.
He's the infection that is corrupting the government.
To make Yanagizawa regret what he did to our master...
...and eradicate the root of such evil from the Shogunate, we must wait to kill Kira...
...until we know the result of our bid for Lord Daigaku's succession.
If we broke into his home like burglars, it would be a disgrace to the name of Asano!
Ours must be a just vengeance, one that shames us before no one!
Our Lord was sentenced, as if he were a criminal...
...to commit seppuku in the garden...
...a death that no other Daimyo has ever been ordered to endure!
Do you think we can avenge
Takumi no Kami...
...that we can purge his bitterness this way?
I beg you all to consider that all your suffering...
...will have been for nothing... if the smallest part of our secret leaks out.
Sir, I have taken your words to heart today!
Now...
...I suppose I'll go back to Kyoto...
...and continue to debauch myself.
AND SO, HALF A YEAR PASSES...
Guy who's "it", guy who's "it", come toward the clapping!
Guy who's "it", guy who's "it", come toward the clapping!
Guy who's "it", guy who's "it", come toward the clapping!
Guy who's "it", guy who's "it", come toward the clapping!
Guy who's "it", guy who's "it", come toward the clapping!
Guy who's "it", guy who's "it", come toward the clapping!
Guy who's "it", guy who's "it", come toward the clapping!
Got you!
- No, no! That's Rui, the waitress!
- Okay, now you're It!
My, my, what a beautiful waitress.
Quiet now, that's enough!
I'm tired of playing with you girls.
Come on, Rui, let's drink!
Let's drink! Come on!
Come on, Rui. Everyone, come!
Oishi, sir,
I'd like a word with you!
I am Sekine Yajiro, a ronin of Echigo.
I'm sorry to intrude upon your merrymaking, but there's something
I'd like to discuss with you.
My, what a boor!
- What a boor!
- Sure, sure... come over here!
Come on over here...
All right, what is it?
What is it, then?
Sir, it's been a year and a half since
Lord Asano's bitter death.
Yet you show no sign of finishing things!
What is the meaning of this?!
People have always spoken most highly of you...
...and everyone just assumed you'd rectify the Shogunate's mistake about Kira Kozuke...
- Who goes there?!
- Now, now, it's fine.
The women probably just came to see what was going on.
Sir!
We've been eagerly waiting, counting the hours until you stand up for your late Lord!
So you must be another of those people who tell me to avenge him, eh?
Certainly!
We firmly believe in you!
Sorry, but this revenge thing is pointless.
What? Oishi!
Do you mean that?
Do you mean what you're saying?!
Just think about it.
The Asano Clan fell because of one moment of lost restraint!
No, no, I myself might be doing all right, but the other vassals have dispersed.
A short-tempered master is a terrible thing.
What's more, Lord Kira was the one who was cut!
I couldn't get "revenge" even if I wanted to!
Oh! Oh, how about you?
What would...
What would you do?
You cowardly dog of a samurai!
You almost made a dog of me, too!
Now, say what you want, but once a man dies, he never comes back.
While you're alive, drink good sake and dally with beautiful women.
That's the joy of this mortal world.
Enough! You bastard,
I'll cut you down!
- I can't let you do that!
- Stop!
Out of the way!
Ukihashi! Ukihashi!
Please calm down!
Move!
Move, woman!
I will not. You're being rude.
What?!
I may be a harlot, but this is still my room.
You could say I, Ukihashi, am queen of the castle here.
I won't let you barge in without permission.
Kuranosuke! Killing scum like you would just soil my sword!
Out of my way!
Scary, scary.
["Uki-sama:" Oishi's nickname]
Now, let's go cheer "Uki-sama" up!
Let's!
Stop it! Do you want to be bitten by dogs?
Never come between people in love.
You dense girls!
Come on, this way.
You're not injured?
I am impressed by your patience.
I'm sure that deep down...
Hello? Uki-sama?
Oh...
Asleep already...
Is he really so scared to die he'll put up with that?!
I know! And he calls himself a samurai?
I'm finally disgusted with Uki-sama.
Is he besotted with Ukihashi?
Truly!
I don't care if he is one of our best customers...
I wouldn't want a spineless samurai like that!
Is that what you all think?
I don't see it that way.
Then how do you see it, Karimo?
He isn't such a coward.
If he were, Ukihashi wouldn't have fallen for him.
Well, you're sure taken with him!
Where is Oishi?!
In that room over there.
Wake up! Uki-sama... you have guests.
Sir, it's me, Junai.
And Yasubei.
W... We're sorry, but we'd like to speak in private.
Ah, you two.
Well, well!
Sir!
You're here about Lord Daigaku's reduction in rank?
Yes, sir. Not only was Lord Daigaku denied succession...
...they reduced his income by 3,000-koku and sent him to live with his relatives in Geishu.
Sir, the last hope of restoring the Asano Clan is gone.
There's no longer...
There's no longer any...!
Ukihashi! Where did Ukihashi go?
Hey! Ukihashi!
Oh, Ukihashi!
- Sir!
- Sir!
Ukihashi! Hey! Uki...
Oh, have you seen Ukihashi?
Yes, just go that way...
Hey! Ukihashi!
Sir...
Master Oishi is returning home.
- Children, it's your father!
- It's Father?
Is that the light of the
Nikenjyaya teahouse?
Or the light of Maruyama?
I'm home!
- Come on! Ugh...
- Look out!
Ah, here we are...
Welcome home, Uki-sama.
Ah, Riku. Let's have some sake!
- Uki-sama...
- Oh! Wait, wait Riku!
She's all muddy.
Wipe her feet, will you?
- Oh, no, you don't have to do that!
- Hey, what's taking so long?!
Go get some sake!
Father!
Oh, Chikara...
What's with that face?
Father, this is going too far!
While you've been out misbehaving every night...
...Mother has waited for you patiently here with the children, without a single complaint!
Every time I see her lonely face, it cuts me to the bone!
It wounds me every day, but I've endured it, because I knew there must be a reason!
Now, Chikara, you mustn't be so rude to your father.
I must and I will! You come home for the first time in days...
...but you don't even hug your young children!
You tell my mother to get you sake and wipe the feet of a dirty harlot!
I'm going to buy the freedom of that "dirty harlot."
Husband, is that true?
I'm sick of you, you washed-up old housewife.
Here are your divorce papers.
Father!
We're over! We're through!
Kuranosuke.
Oh, hello, Mother.
You'd better not send Riku back to her parents...
...so that you can bring a prostitute here.
As your mother,
I won't stand for it!
Mother, it's all right.
No, I've been enduring this scandalous dissipation...
...because I was sure he was doing it to fool our enemies.
Riku, you mustn't think I've been spoiling him just because he's my son.
No, ma'am.
I completely understand.
Kuranosuke! This has been hard on your mother...
...but it's been even harder on Riku!
Riku, I'm amazed you've stuck with him this long.
I can't tell you how grateful I am.
And now you want to divorce your loyal wife?!
Yes... Yes.
Something wrong with that?
Kuranosuke, are you...
M... Mother!
Oh, hey! Hey, Ukihashi!
Where are you going?
Kuranosuke...
Could it be that the time has come for you to go to Edo?
Kuranosuke, why don't you answer me?
Is there something you can't say in front of your own mother...
...and your wife of many years?
Mother... please lay off.
If this is about going to Edo,
I'm sure Riku would be happy to hear it.
Now, tell us.
A single word is enough.
Enough! "Revenge this,"
"revenge that"...
Is there someplace I can go where they don't know that word?
Kuranosuke! Are you saying you have no intention of avenging your dead Lord?
None! None whatsoever!
Oh, you traitor!
You disrespectful son!
I didn't raise you to be so unfaithful and ungrateful!
Mother!
Divorced! We're through!
If you're tossing Riku out,
I won't stay either!
Come on, everyone, let's go.
Yes.
Will you go to Tajima with your mother?
Or stay here with your father?
Father...!
Decide for yourself.
I'm 15 now, Father.
I won't slow you down, so please take me with you!
Kuranosuke.
I cannot leave our late Lord's memorial tablet here...
...so I'm taking it with me.
Any objections?
A strange thing to ask for!
Do what you like.
TABLET: "WORLDLY NAME:
OISHI KURANOSUKE"
Riku! Riku!
Yes?
And so, Husband...
...I bid you farewell.
Please... take care of the children.
I will.
And you, Husband...
The weather is growing very changeable...
...so please be mindful of your health.
You too...
My mother is old, so please make sure she is careful.
I will.
We'll bring you back lots of presents, Father.
Look after the house while we're gone!
Have you said your goodbyes?
The palanquin is waiting.
You should tend to your health!
Now, let's go.
I'll see you off.
Now say goodbye to Father.
Goodbye!
Goodbye, big brother.
Take care of yourself.
Goodbye!
Goodbye!
Father!
Where is Kuranosuke?
He's bought Ukihashi's freedom, and now he's drinking more heavily than ever.
It's just as you said.
He's going to Edo.
He even renounced his wife and children, all to trick us.
Are you telling me to kill Oishi?
I... I can't do it!
Have you fallen for him just like Ukihashi?!
You wouldn't understand.
But if I fail, please tell
Councilor Chisaka...
...that he was right about
Oishi, and I was wrong.
What does that mean?
If you tell him, he'll understand.
Sir...
I've brought you some tea.
Rui...
Y... Yes?
You can have that ball.
But sir, that ball is...
My youngest daughter's.
Well, I think I'll have some of that tea.
- Rui...
- Yes?
You've often said that Kyoto...
...is a better place than Edo.
Yes.
A woman's happiness...
...comes from having a good husband...
...and being surrounded by her beloved children.
Do you think you can do that, Rui?
If you can do it, Uki-sama...
...then I should be able to recognize the sound of a child's ball.
What's wrong? You're shaking.
I think I'll head out now.
She's botched it.
Let me go! There's no time!
You won't...
You won't be able to kill him!
I'm not in love with him!
You mustn't! You'll just die a dog's death!
You're no match for him. Don't do it!
Unhand me!
Father, we were right... it's Okahei.
Chisaka Hyobu sent him.
Hyobu...
As we expected, Asano Daigaku was denied his succession.
An excellent cautionary example.
I find it truly regrettable,
My Lord.
How unfortunate that Lord Yanagizawa was not a bit more judicious!
What would you do if you were in the government?
I would have granted him the succession and 10,000-koku of income.
Do you think that would lessen the danger to my father's life?
That is part of it...
...but the Takumi no
Kami incident...
...is also causing an unexpected public rejection of Yanagizawa's governance.
Enough!
Be sure you guard my father well!
Necessary though it was,
I ask your forgiveness...
...for my misconduct and my waste of so much money.
Nonsense!
You have our sympathies, in particular for the way you had to part from your family.
The time is coming when the rest of you will...
...also have to leave your families forever.
From now on, your comrades here are your brothers.
Yes, but look at this!
Sir, I'm overcome with shame about how
I cursed your methods last year in Edo.
When they heard Lord Daigaku's request for succession was denied...
...72 men came to me with all sorts of excuses for taking their names off the list.
Only 47 of us left...
Father, may we get out the tools we've prepared for the raid?
Open them!
We'll let the winds from Mt. Fuji clear the smoke in our hearts...
...and see the moon over Kiyomigaseki.
If afterwards we could live on in memory...
...we would be held up as examples of filial devotion.
Oh, what happiness!
ASSEMBLING IN EDO
Oh, what happiness!
Oh, what happiness!
This express letter from Kyoto says they'll be splitting... into five groups and coming to Edo.
Oishi's group is the largest.
I hope that they arrive safely...
What are Kira's defenses like, Okano?
Sir, they're extremely tight.
What's more, Kira's refurbished the inside of his mansion, so we don't know the layout.
I don't see Akagaki or Katsuta...
Maki, leave us alone for a bit.
Another brotherly fight?
Hmm? Oh, no, none of that today.
Genzo, do you know what the townsfolk of Edo are saying?
They're calling the Ako ronin a bunch of cowards!
Brother, I wish you would stop bringing that up.
You absolutely refuse to bare your heart to me?
There's nothing to bare!
Lord Asano's the one who cut Kira in the first place...
...so taking revenge just isn't logical.
I'm your own brother!
Your own blood!
Yeah, but if there's no logic in revenge, what am I supposed to do about it?
Genzo! Your Lord gave you a stipend of 200-koku!
You're a disgrace to all samurai!
Brother, that was unusually violent of you.
Shut up!
Getting so angry is ruining your health.
From this moment on, you are no longer my brother!
There's no help for it...
Get out!
All right.
Take care. Goodbye.
You don't have to run away just because you saw me!
- But my clothes are so slovenly...
- Oh, husband, it's you!
Get in here!
Come on.
Where are you living?
I'm still masterless, so...
You and the other ronin must be working so hard!
I am proud. Shinza... when will you take your revenge?
Revenge is the furthest thing from my mind, sir!
Nonsense, Shinza. You're the son-in-law
I chose myself! Why hide it from me?
Every time I see those dirty clothes,
I am so grateful to you.
Father, I must take my leave.
Wait! At least greet our child!
Go away, we're having an important conversation!
Shinza! Why do you hide this?!
As a gift to your dying father- in-law, tell me the truth!
Revenge is impossible, sir!
What?!
Why, you!
Never darken my doorstep again!
"THIS ROOM: KAKIMI GOROBEI,
STEWARD TO THE KONOE"
Why are you attacking me?!
Shut up! You're not going to say that sign is a fake, are you?!
No, sir! Of course not!
Come, now, stop this violence.
But, sir...
- We have a problem!
- What?
I'll investigate this myself.
Take me to him.
Wait, everyone! Wait!
Our business is too important!
We have to dispose of him!
If we don't kill him, we'll never achieve our goal!
Stop! You're being too reckless! Now wait!
If we kill him, we'll be wanted men.
Our goal will be out of reach!
But sir, our backs are against the wall. We have no choice!
Wait.
I am the envoy of the Konoe Clan,
Kakimi Gorobei.
I'm obliged to ask you...
Are you calling yourself Kakimi Gorobei, envoy of the Konoe Clan?
- I am.
- What?
As you can see, we are transporting the tools for an important task.
What? "An important task"?
What task is that?
["Rinnoji no Miya:" A person, likely a member of the Imperial family]
We are delivering celebratory gifts from the Konoe Clan to Rinnoji no Miya.
Hmm... then I'll just have a look inside that chest!
Stop! You go too far!
How dare you!
I'm sure you have your reasons for appearing out of the blue...
...using my name, and treating me as an imposter.
Tell me what is going on.
The impudence!
You say that I am the imposter?
There is only one Kakimi
Gorobei in this world.
Then I'll ask you this: if you're really Kakimi Gorobei...
...I trust you carry promissory notes issued by the Konoe Clan?
Well?
Do you have them?
Let me see them.
How could I travel without promissory notes?
Quite. So let me see them.
Well? Come on.
P... Produce them!
You're a careful man.
Take a good look.
NOTE: THIS DESIGN IS
THE ASANO FAMILY CREST.
Asano...
Barbarians!
Get out!
Yes, My Lord!
Yes, My Lord!
That is unmistakably...
...a Konoe note.
I most humbly beg that you forgive me...
...for brashly using your name.
No need...
I fully realize that you only did so because circumstances required it.
Fellow samurai must support each other.
We are never so keenly grateful for the kindness of others...
...as when we have fallen on hard times.
I must make some small amends for what I've done.
These are the Konoe promissory notes that I forged.
Please, I want you to have them.
Sir Kakimi...
Journey without worry... I pray from the bottom of my heart...
...that you will successfully complete your task.
Farewell.
You say Okahei was killed?
Yes. I am sure he is no longer alive.
I see. I've had no letters from him since September 10th.
["Yamaoka:" Okahei's family name.]
That's the night that
Sir Yamaoka was killed.
Only moments before he died,
I was almost killed as well.
Councilor...
I asked him to tell you that you were right about Oishi, and I was wrong.
Yet now I am alive, and Yamaoka is dead.
What did Oishi do after that?
Since he sold off his temporary residence in Yamashina, he has not been seen.
I was sure he'd come to Edo, so I hurried to follow him here...
...but I have found no signs of him.
He couldn't have beaten you here.
From what you've seen of Oishi, do you think he'll take his revenge?
Yamaoka says in the letter that he probably doesn't intend to do it.
You wrote that he
did intend to.
What is it?
What is it?
Have you fallen in love with that dandy?
Even you think so? That's the same thing Yamaoka asked me.
No, no, consider that a joke.
There's one thing... one thing I am sure of.
I got it out of Oishi.
What? What is it?
[Note: March 14th is the day Lord]
Asano committed seppuku.
Oishi died on March 14th.
He's dead?
Everything he has done has been in pursuit of a single goal.
For you see...
...despite all the women and sake, his eyes and bearing were clear and pure.
He was horrifyingly beautiful.
Rui, you've shown great perception.
- I'll take my leave now!
- No, you won't!
If there are others who share Oishi's goal...
...I imagine they have the same eyes and demeanor.
Rui, tomorrow I want you to go and stay at Lord Kira's estate.
Me, go to Lord Kira's?
You're the only one who could expose any Ako spies who might be there.
Please... don't make me do it!
Come in.
Kanzaki!
Maebara!
I'm glad you made it here safely!
You amaze me, opening a shop right under Kira's nose.
But I'm also very impressed with
Okano's work as chief clerk!
Oishi's group is the only one yet to arrive, and I think they'll be here soon.
Come on.
- How could you not see him?!
- Sir, I haven't done anything!
- Sir, he's my friend...
- Shut up! Where were you born?
Edo, sir. Edo!
Don't lie to me!
- You bastard!
- Why, you!
Something's going on out front.
- It's a nighttime noodle vendor.
- I'll go take a look!
Hey, what are you doing?!
Oh, I'm sorry.
Please, wait! Sirs, this man is like a little brother to me. Please, spare him.
Now apologize to these men!
Who the hell are you?!
I own a trinket shop right across from here.
My name is Gohei.
Please, forgive us. Please!
Are you saying you'll vouch for him, trinket man?
Yes, yes.
If he's not who you say he is, I'll have you evicted!
I promise you, he is.
All right, scram.
Thank you! We're so sorry.
I'm sorry.
I want to somehow get my hands on up-to-date plans of the estate.
Thank goodness. Sugino almost got dragged into Kira's mansion!
Sugino's posing as a nighttime noodle vendor.
Oh, I see...
Oh!
Oh!
Sugino!
I saw those bastards beat you...
I'm so glad you made it here safely.
Well, for now why don't you eat some of my noodles?
Good evening.
Oh, welcome!
The teeth of my comb broke.
Hmm, which one should I buy?
Is it for you?
Let's see...
How do you like this one?
I don't want something so childish!
Well then...
Say, Kin, are you all alone tonight?
Yes.
What were you doing just now?
Oh, nothing really.
What were you doing just now?
Kin, do you mean to live here like this forever?
Well, yes, I suppose...
I see.
Well, that makes me happy. After all, that way I can keep seeing you every day!
Err... your comb...
Tell me, Kin, where are you from?
You mean, my hometown?
It's...
It's in the west, isn't it?
Yes... I suppose it is west.
I was right!
I can tell everything about you, Kin.
Everything?
You're honest and hardworking, and you carry a great ambition in your heart.
Am I right? I bet you want to own your own little shop someday...
...instead of working here all by yourself in someone else's.
You do know everything.
See? I really do know you.
He can't stay like that!
What's wrong?
Horibe...
I lecture Okano every time
I see him. You tell him too!
- Kanzaki!
- Okano!
I'm so glad you made it safely!
Hey, Okano. Haven't you gotten the estate plans from Suzu yet?
If we don't get them immediately, it'll be too late.
I know.
The girl is infatuated with you.
If you take advantage of that, we could have those plans.
Horibe, I can't deceive a woman.
But we absolutely must have post-renovation plans of Kira's mansion!
She's crazy about you.
It's a small sacrifice for a great cause.
Look at Oishi!
Think of the suffering he has managed to endure.
But misleading a woman...
...is something I just can't do.
A palanquin is entering
Kira's estate!
Father... I'm glad to see you looking so well.
As I get older, the cold gets to me more and more.
November's come so quickly.
Well, come in.
Okano... when Oishi parted with his family in Yamashina...
...even those of us watching from a distance wept.
Kanzaki...
...trampling on the feelings of an innocent girl in love is more than I...
Please, just drop it.
We believe Oishi is in Edo, My Lord.
Oishi?
Ah...
...the chief councilor of Ako?
Yes.
Oh, there's nothing to fear from a man like that.
Hyobu, make sure our security is tight.
Yes. We already have the most prominent of the Ako ronin under surveillance.
Stop. Why are you so interested in my house?
This is a public road, isn't it?
Maybe, but you've been roaming around since this morning!
What time do you think it is?!
If you want something, come inside!
Come on!
EDO
EDO
This makes 46. Everyone but Yato
Emoshichi has arrived in Edo.
This makes 46. Everyone but Yato
Emoshichi has arrived in Edo.
Your safe arrival has put the men in higher spirits than I could've imagined!
What's the situation in Kira's estate?
Sir... he's apparently made extensive renovations...
...and we still don't know the layout inside the mansion.
And its defenders?
They have master swordsmen from the Uesugi Clan...
...and at least 10 are on duty at all times.
Some of them are famous: Shimizu Ichigaku,
Kobayashi Heihachiro, Waku Handayu...
There was a Kira spy hanging around in front of my house, too.
And it's just like you said last year...
Lady Yozen'in's estate isn't safe either.
Do they know that my father is in Edo?
I doubt that Kira's people have noticed yet...
...but the citizens of Edo have gradually started... to curse the ronin of Ako for cowardice...
...and people like me, whose faces they know, are being called dogs.
How much money do we have?
We've managed to make ends meet, but we're almost broke.
Has there been any discord among you? Has our secret been leaked?
We've all sworn on our lives.
There's absolutely no worry there.
Ultimately, what we absolutely must do before the raid...
...is to get a map of the inside of Kira's estate.
That, and... we must find out what Kira himself looks like.
Not a single one of us has ever seen him!
No, that is not so...
I have seen Kira's face.
You have?
As fate would have it, he was serving the Shogun...
...three years ago when I accompanied our master to Nijo Castle in Kyoto.
I perfectly remember his looks and the eboshi daimon he wore.
Out of the 47 of us, only you know him...
How very curious.
With this many of us in Edo, someone is bound to discover us.
We can't take our time anymore!
Please, let's do it before the end of the year.
Emoshichi journeys here with his mother in tow.
I hope he will arrive in time.
Mother...
I'm so sorry, but I have nothing more to sell.
It was wrong of me to come along.
I should have forced myself to let you go.
Leave me here, and make better time by yourself.
I...
Mother!
You mustn't think of doing it!
What nonsense.
Death is easy.
If I stay with you,
I'll only cause you trouble.
Where are you going?
I still have my sword!
But, Emoshichi!
You... You...
You mean to go unarmed?!
This sword is a memento of your father.
Leave here now while you can.
I'll do whatever I have to from here.
This money should at least feed you for a day.
I'm so sorry.
Mother... please take care.
When I've found a home in Edo...
...I swear I'll come back for you!
Emoshichi...
...I'm so proud of you for keeping your great secret, never telling it even to me.
I know that this is our final goodbye.
Hurry up and go.
Hurry up and go!
Leave!
Y... Yes.
Rui!
Yes?
Today we'll finally find out whether Oishi is in Edo!
What do you mean?
The ronin of Ako...
...are concerned that
Lord Kira might take refuge... at our master's family home of Yonezawa.
But wouldn't Lord Kira need the Shogun's permission to go to Yonezawa?
Of course.
But I planted a rumor to that effect with the merchants who supply Kira's estate.
So you intend to trick the Ako ronin into attacking a fake convoy?
Yes! That's it exactly!
You don't look too pleased.
We have to do this to save our master's house.
Where did this rumor that Kira was going to Yonezawa come from?!
The merchants who regularly sell to him.
What's more, they say he's leaving today!
If this does turn out to be true, today is the last chance we'll get for a long time!
Sir!
If Oishi and the others are in Edo, they're sure to attack the processional.
Yonezawa is too far away.
Councilor, it's a naïve idea.
Even if Oishi is in Edo, he won't walk into such a trap, only to die a dog's death!
You have that high an opinion of Oishi?!
An old man used to luxury...
...wouldn't be eager to go to the snow country.
But I think he might if it were to save his own life.
Hara...
...do even you think that?
Sir! You still say this is a trick of Chisaka's?!
What is it? What happened?
Kira's procession!
Kira's procession has just left the gate!
What will you do?!
Sir!
There's not a moment to lose!
Excuse me!
Wait, all of you!
How can you tell us to wait now?!
Excuse me!
Don't be rash!
I have to know!
Are you right, or am I?
Come on!
That palanquin is empty.
Well?!
It's strange.
Nothing's happened.
Is it Oishi?! Shimizu, follow that man.
If you have to, kill him.
Hey!
- Wait!
- Hold it!
You attack me knowing it's unjust?
It's a swordfight! A swordfight with Lord Kira's men!
It's a swordfight with
Lord Kira's men!
Withdraw! Withdraw!
Stay back!
- Stay back!
- Sir...
There's no question; he means to get revenge.
Avoid letting Lord Kira outside as much as possible. And find the spy!
Yes, sir.
They're insulting! I got mistaken for an
Ako spy at Kira's place the other day...
...and some samurai sent me flying like a rag doll. Now look at me!
Last year everyone said the Ako ronin would get revenge, but nothing's happened.
["Oishi:" Lit., "big rock."]
That Oishi's no big rock, he's a small pebble.
It's a disgrace!
Ako had 53,000-koku.
They must've had lots of samurai, but not one avenges his master! How pathetic!
Yeah, I'm a total stranger and
I could just about do it myself!
I mean, you linger a second outside the guy's gate and they knock you down!
So maybe the ronin of Ako can't get near him, either. But seriously...
...isn't anyone going to avenge him?
Yes!
I don't know about anybody else, but there's one who'll kill Kira!
Oh? Is it Oishi Kuranosuke?
Or his son Chikara?
Or Horibe Yasubei?
But he's just a dog now.
No, no!
So who's the man who's going to get revenge for this bump here?
Katsuta Shinzaemon!
I've never heard of him!
You fools! Katsuta married my daughter! He's my son-in-law!
And where is this son of yours?
In the same row houses as you!
- As me?
- Yeah.
But...
That samurai who looks like a dirty beggar!
Jerk! What do you mean, "beggar"?!
He's so weak-looking!
Just you wait!
I know Katsuta will get revenge!
- What a joke.
- Don't make me laugh!
Personally I agree the Uesugi Clan should take Lord Kira in...
...but we'll have to wait for a good opportunity.
May I ask your reason, My Lord?
I don't know who put it into his head, but at my audience with the
Shogun the other day...
...he said that ordering Takumi no Kami to commit seppuku...
...and taking his 53,000-koku was a rash decision.
He asked me how the ronin of
Ako were doing, and the like.
In the end, he even admonished me.
What did he say?
He told me not to act on my own in his name.
Could Okado Denpachiro have prodded the Inspector General and the Elders...
...into bending the Shogun's ear?
Hmm, I would like to see him dismissed...
...but he has depths of strength to him.
At any rate, I can't grant this request right now.
"Current locations of former
Asano vassals"?
What is this?
The magistrate's office requested that information about the Ako ronin.
Throw it away.
But...!
I said, throw it away!
How are we supposed to "keep them in line" when they aren't making any trouble?
Chisaka probably put this through by cozying up to the magistrates.
This will be our last meeting until the day we strike.
When will we make our raid?
Within the next 10 days.
When we've made sure
Kira will be at home.
Once the date is set,
I'll visit you and let you know.
Until then, those without duties to perform must not go outside.
This is the critical moment that will determine whether we succeed or fail.
All of us must protect this secret with our lives.
Emoshichi didn't make it, after all.
Emoshichi!
Everyone, I beg to be forgiven for being late.
Emoshichi, thank goodness you're here!
We'll strike within 10 days.
Where have you come from?
I rushed straight here from an inn in Kanagawa.
Where is your mother?
We couldn't pay for the room, so I left my mother at the inn in Kanagawa, as their hostage.
Emoshichi...
...I will make sure you see your mother before the raid.
We've already said our goodbyes.
My mother has resigned herself to this.
Please, don't worry about us.
Okano...
This is a memento of my mother.
Will you deliver it to Emoshichi's mother for me?
Sir...
...I swear to you that I will obtain a plan of the mansion.
What is it you wanted to talk to me about?
Come on, tell me quickly.
Yes... I'll tell you now.
Suzu...
There's something I want of you.
What is it?
I'll give you anything.
Come, what is it?
Suzu...
I'd like you to show me the plans to Kira's estate.
What?
I just want to look at them.
Then I'll give them right back.
The plans...?
I beg you, please.
You want them that much?
- You can't mean to...
- Suzu...
What's your answer?
Will you... Will you help me?
Or not?
Kin...
There's something
I'd like to ask you first.
- What is it?
- Kin...
Do you love me... even a little?
Or are you just using me to get the plans?
Th... That's...
Which? Please, tell me.
Which is it?
I love you. You're the one
I love best in this world.
Truly? You mean it?
If I didn't love you, I wouldn't have suffered so much.
I love you too, Suzu.
That's exactly... why I'm so...
Don't say any more.
That's enough...
...to make me happy.
I have what I've always wanted...
Kin!
Oh my. Father, I thought you were asleep upstairs.
What did you take from the cabinet?
Money.
Liar! You've never wanted for money. Show me!
No! No!
I'm begging you, please just let me go!
Show me. Hand it over!
It's nothing. Go upstairs and keep out of this.
Yessir.
If you eavesdrop, you'll pay for it!
Forgive me!
Suzu... do you know the truth about him?
Do you know who he is?
Yes.
And did he tell you his name?
No.
Hurry, go!
Thank you, my love.
In my heart, you're my wife.
That's the truth, isn't it, Kin?
But...
...this is goodbye forever.
At least... At least tell me your real name.
It's...
Suzu! Don't ask him needless questions!
Masagoro, sir...
I do regular business with Lord Kira.
Kin, I don't give a damn about your worldly name.
I know the two of you can't be together.
But you'd better marry her once and for all in the next life!
Please.
I will, sir.
You swear it?
Yes.
Thank you. Now go, before anyone sees you.
Yes, sir.
Suzu...
Kin!
Kin...
In the next life...
In the next life, I swear it.
Yes!
Father!
Halt!
What are you wandering around for?
Hello. I'm on my way to visit a friend.
I mean no harm, sir.
Lies!
You're no ordinary townsman.
You're wrong, sir.
I work in a trinket shop...
Show me what you have there.
What do you mean, sir?
I don't have anything.
You see?
No more lies!
Hey!
I think you're an Ako spy!
Why would you say that?
I'm nothing of the sort!
Silence! Rui...
Rui! Are you running away?!
No, sir, I promise you there's nothing to be suspicious of.
Hmm? Confess!
But there's nothing to confess...
I really don't know anything.
- Show me what you're hiding!
- I don't...
What is it?
You still won't tell me?!
Please... Please let me go.
- Stand up.
- Okay.
- Stand up!
- All right.
Sir Shimizu!
Sir Shimizu!
What? This is men's business.
Step aside.
But Kin is my husband-to-be! Please don't mistake him for someone else.
- He's your man?
- Yes.
Don't you dare loiter around here!
Kin...
My darling...
...thank you.
No... you've endured so much.
Do you know the tea ceremony?
Only a little...
How about haiku poetry?
I regret to say not.
Will you come on the 14th?
It'll be quite the crowd. Well?
Yes.
I'm afraid I must attend to some personal business...
...so I will take my leave.
This gives us the strength of a thousand men!
Well done, Okano.
How did you come by that wound?
It's nothing.
You did your duty.
I'm sure Suzu will understand.
What are you talking about?
Suzu is my wife.
It's only natural for a wife to be of service to her husband.
As I arranged your marriage, here is my wedding gift.
Open up!
Get in!
Do you still refuse to talk, you Ako spy?!
I don't know what you're talking about, sir!
How about now?!
I don't know!
I don't know anything!
Then why were you hanging around the gate?!
Confess!
Why you!
Take that!
Why, you!
Take that!
Hurry up and talk!
Confess, you swine!
Well?! Take this, you stubborn bastard!
You got it wrong!
What are you doing?!
I'm ill!
Hey, this guy was at the gate the other day.
These people are innocent.
Why treat them so cruelly?
Yamaoka's been murdered.
He and I were friends since childhood.
I'll have my revenge upon those Ako scum!
But Sir Yamaoka was...
Fortunately, we've discovered where Oishi's staying.
After he returns, you will bring him out to me.
Mr. Kakimi, sir, you have a visitor.
Well, now...
Rui.
It's been a long time.
And what can I do for
Chisaka today?
He asked me to confirm that you're here...
...and obtain proof that you plan to attack.
You hid a dagger... behind your back that day, didn't you?
And today it is you... who is hiding something behind your back.
And will you stop at nothing to find out what it is?
You and the other ronin risked your lives to come here.
The beauty of that act has cut me to the core.
You look so noble.
And the actions of Lord Uesugi and Lord Kira are so ugly!
How long will they continue?
And I participated in them.
After witnessing your nobility...
...I can't bear to be their dog anymore!
That which you hid from me, your belongings, and your life are all in danger here.
Lord Kira must stay in Edo until the end of the year.
On the 14th, he'll hold a tea ceremony, and everyone in the estate will feast.
Rui...
...are you trying to get yourself killed?
No...
...if I wanted to die,
I would attack you...
...and die by your sword.
Say... what have you done with that ball?
- I threw it away.
- You threw it away?
I pray that you will achieve your goal.
You're a ronin from Ako.
Going to visit Oishi?
What? No, you have the wrong man.
Silence!
Hold it!
Please, stop!
Rui! Rui!
Did you see a woman out front when you came in?
A woman I didn't know was just cut down by Shimizu while trying to protect me.
What?!
Sir! It's true, there will be a tea ceremony at Kira's mansion on the 14th.
Rui! Rui! Rui!
Rui...
Rui...
Thank you.
Damn that Oishi...
I looked... everywhere...
Oishi wasn't there.
He'd just...
...just left...
...the inn...
Rui!
We'll strike on the 14th.
THE 14TH
Hello! Sugi!
Sugi!
Oh, Genzo!
Hey! Where are you going?
Hey, wait!
Do we have a guest, Sugi?
Yes. It's Genzo.
Goodness! Genzo?
Yes. He says if the Master is out, he'd like to speak to you.
Honestly, how could my husband have such a drunken lout for a brother?
What should I tell him?
Let's see...
Say this awful snow has my stomach pains acting up, and I'm sick in bed.
But what if he wants to pay you a get-well visit?
Hmm...
Tell me, what should we do?
Well, I'm going to sleep, so lay out a futon for me, quick as you can.
All right.
- Sugi! Sugi!
- Yes?
Also, tell him my husband will be out late...
...on business, and probably won't be back until after nightfall.
Then chase him away, quick!
- Yes, My Lady.
The Mistress is sick in bed. This awful snow has given her the usual trouble.
There you go, lying.
Well, if you think I'm lying, go and check on her yourself!
No, never mind. Just tell her to take care of herself in this cold weather.
Fortunately, I have some medicine.
Give this to her for me.
What, your personal medicine box too?
Yes.
All right.
What is it?
Well, I'm told that the Master is out on business...
...and won't return until this evening.
What? This evening?
Yes.
That's no good.
Sugi, put those clothes in front of the alcove.
Oh, are you going to wear it?
No. I just have to do something.
Like this?
Yes. Take this.
And do what?
Put it there.
Now leave me for a while.
Well, please don't put it on.
Well, Brother, I was adopted into the Akagaki at a young age...
...and I have never forgotten for an instant the kindness... you've shown me ever since.
I've come today to say my farewells, but unfortunately you are not here.
I leave dejected.
After you've lived out a long life, and I see you in the next world...
...I plan to give you my thanks for all you've done for me.
My! Genzo, are you crying?
Huh...? Of course not!
The cold just made my eyes water.
Oh, you're never serious! But are you going somewhere far away?
Yes, I suppose I am.
- When will you be back?
- A good question.
Next July will be the first Bon
Festival after my departure,
...so I will definitely be back for that.
It's bad luck to say that!
You're talking like you're already a ghost.
A ghost, eh?
Well, when the time comes, I hate dumplings and bean-paste buns...
...so leave me sake for an offering, okay?
I owe you a lot, don't I?
Hurry up and find yourself a good husband.
Mind your own business.
But I guess no one would take you, huh?
Hmph!
Is he gone?
Yes. He left this medicine for your stomach cramps.
What?
He gave it to me, along with his own pill case.
He seemed very different than usual... very lonely.
Why... Kuranosuke!
I've been waiting for so long.
Ever since I heard you were in Edo...
...each day I've wondered,
"Is this the day I'll see him?"
I've... I've waited so fervently for this day!
I do not deserve such great consideration, My Lady.
You seem so weary... somehow.
Kuranosuke, you've visited us in the midst of a great snowstorm.
Can it finally be that...
Lady Toda.
I've come because I'm about to travel somewhere far away...
...and I thought I wouldn't have another chance to visit.
Where is this faraway place?
You see...
...a certain western Daimyo is taking me into his service, so I came to say my farewells.
What? Another Daimyo?
Kuranosuke, is this true?
Why do you ask?
Now that Lord Daigaku has been denied his inheritance...
...you would go serve another
Master, in another house...
...without the slightest thought of vengeance for our dead Lord?
I want to know how you can do such a thing!
- Kuranosuke.
- Yes?
You are the only one in all the world upon whom I can rely.
I beg you, be candid with me.
My Lady, there is nothing I haven't been candid about.
The day of Takumi no Kami's seppuku, the only message he gave to Kataoka was for you.
I know you can never forget it!
Do you say you have no intention of answering the call to revenge...
...that echoes from the dagger he sent you, the one that took his life?
None?
None?
None, then?!
None whatsoever.
Then, there's nothing more to be said.
But, when I think of how deeply Takumi no Kami trusted you, it breaks my heart!
This is goodbye.
I hope you will take care of yourself in this cold weather.
Give it to him.
Kuranosuke, my Lady remembered how easily you get cold...
...and she sewed this silk headscarf herself, to give to you if you came.
Kuranosuke, the two of us are alone now. Please, tell me the truth.
Lady Toda, I have already told you the truth.
Now, I'll take my leave.
Oh, Lady Yozen'in's anger made this completely slip my mind.
These are the travel poems I wrote on my journey to Edo.
After Lady Yozen'in's anger has abated, please read them to her.
You insist you will not take revenge, then?
Excuse me.
Lady Toda.
You cannot be too careful these day. Please, take care...
...to lock the doors tightly, blow out all the candles, and so forth.
Goodbye.
Sugi says Genzo came while I was out.
Ah... yes.
You must have seen him.
How did he look?
Was he well?
Unfortunately,
I had a stomachache...
Oh?
Well, it's not your fault you were sick.
- Sugi!
- Yes?
Why is this here?
Sir...
...Genzo said he was going someplace far away...
...so he wanted to say farewell to you, and then he left that sake...
What? He came to say goodbye?
And left sake here?
And was he acting oddly at all?
Yes. He... well, it seemed like he was crying.
Crying?
Then when I asked if he was crying, he said the cold made his eyes water.
It was strange, somehow.
Genzo cried?
What day is it today?
Well, it's the 14th...
Why on Earth didn't you receive him?!
Father, Katsuta is here.
Shinza is here? Well, does he still look poor and scruffy?
He's very well-dressed.
So he's come to say goodbye?
And? Did he mention revenge?
No. He said he'd been taken into Lord Sendai's service.
What? Lord Sendai?!
Father, I pray for your good health.
I'm told you've been taken into Lord
Sendai's service. Is it true?
Yes.
I'll come bring Yae to our new home when things have settled down...
...but today I came to bid you my leave.
Shut up!
Did you think the sight of those fine clothes...
...would make me happy?
I have no use for a samurai who forgets his duty to his Lord...
...refuses to avenge him, and now serves two masters!
A... As of today...
...you are no longer my son!
Oh, Father!
How could you?!
Leave! Get out!
I have no choice.
Darling!
This money is to buy what you need for the journey.
But it's so much!
I'm traveling to Sendai ahead of you.
You never know what could happen.
Darling, please at least see your child!
Yae! Stay away from that disloyal samurai! That coward!
Look, baby, it's your father.
Please don't worry about what my father said.
Yae, take good care of our son.
You're acting differently today.
What is it?
Kobai! What are you doing?!
Intruder!
Intruder! Intruder!
Intruder! Stop her!
It's Kobai, the new servant!
Forty-seven orders, all ready!
Food for forty-seven, all ready!
"We hereby swear to abide by all of these provisions."
"And, should we, by unhappy chance, fail to kill Lord Kira...
"...we shall set fire to the estate and each man shall disembowel himself."
My Lady!
It's a vengeance pact!
How foolish I've been! How could I not have noticed...
...Kuranosuke's inner anguish, his painstaking caution?!
And in truth, it's thanks to Kuranosuke that we were able to deal with Kobai.
Oh, what should I do?
Kuranosuke! Kuranosuke!
Forgive me!
Men, time to go!
Go!
Those are Yamaga-school war drums!
The ronin of Ako are assaulting us!
Men, attack! Attack them!
Asano's vassals are paying a visit!
We are after Kozuke no Suke and no one else!
["The Statement of the Vassals of Asano Takumi no Kami"]
Asano's vassals are paying a visit! We are after Kozuke no Suke and no one else!
Those who resist us will be slain, and those who run, spared!
Women and children, flee!
Only the women and children can leave! Men, stay here!
You bastard!
Father, are you hurt?
Oh my faithless son, I was just toying with him! Get going, you idiot!
My apologies!
Idiot!
Idiot! Just leave!
Sorry!
Find Kira.
So it was you.
I, Okano Kin'emon, will fight you!
Hey! Still no sign of Kira?!
We can't find him!
He ran away!
- Where's Kira?
- I don't see him anywhere!
- You still can't find him?!
- Not yet!
Still no sign of him?!
I have no idea where he's hiding!
Still nothing?!
Lord Kira!
I, Oishi Kuranosuke, have come here with 46 other men...
...in order to avenge
Takumi no Kami.
Now, end your life.
Coward! Goodbye, then!
Big news!
Big news!
Big news, big news! Listen up!
Hey, what happened?
The ronin of Ako!
They did it! They finally did it!
Last night...! They raided Kira's mansion and took his head.
Hey!
Ow ow ow!
Was Katsuta one of them?
Was my son Shinzaemon there or not?!
Answer me, dammit!
Ow! My ears!
You'll rip off my ears!
I don't care about your ears!
Tell me, was he there?!
- Sir! Put this on!
- No one knows yet!
Hey! Was Shinzaemon there or not?!
I don't know!
You fool!
Ouch! Sir, calm down!
Ladies and gentlemen! Behold this rare record of an amazing event!
Over 40 Ako ronin from Banshu raided Kira's mansion...
...and successfully slew their enemy!
Hey! Hey! Show me that list!
That's a limited edition!
Please make it quick!
I know, I know! If I see a name
I like, I'll buy every last copy!
Hey! This ink is so light,
I can't read it!
No, sir, you've got it face-down.
Wait, wait, stay calm. Let's see...
"Oishi Kuranosuke..."
Yes, that's Oishi for you.
Bravo! I'm humbled, sir!
Is your son there, sir?
Get back! "Oishi Chikara,
Yoshida Chuzaemon...
"...Horibe Yahei Kanemaru,
Horibe Yasubei Taketsune..."
Isn't he there?
Shut up! "Otaka Gengo,
Takebayashi Tadashichi...
"...Okano Kinzaemon, Kataoka
Gengoemon, Sugino Juheiji...
He's not there, sir!
"...Maebara Isuke, Kanzaki Yogoro...
"K... K... Katsuta Shinzaemon."
He's here...
He's here.
He's here... He's here!
He's on the list!
Sir! Sir!
We've lost.
Stop! Where are you going?
To kill the Ako ronin!
Wait! You must not!
You must not!
We'd just go the way of the Asano Clan.
Dear, you'll catch your death of cold! Sugi, Sugi!
Yes?
I know my brother was one of the
Ako warriors. Go and find out!
But Master, what if he isn't?
A man knows his own brother!
Go! Go!
All right!
Sugi.
Yes?
When you see him...
...you yell as loud as you can...
... "That boozer Genzo is with them!"
Yes, sir.
Yae! Yae!
Yes?
K... K... K... K...
Katsuta was there.
Sh... Shinza's name is on the list!
Congratulations.
Congratulations!
Genzo!
Sugi?
Sugi...
Give my best to my brother.
Darling!
Suzu, be glad.
Because of your help, I've well and truly avenged my Lord.
This is from Oishi.
All right.
Live a long life.
I'll be praying for your happiness from the other world.
Who goes there?
Don't you know you're near the Palace?
What strange breed of men are you...
...that you presume to enter here, wearing such grotesque clothes, and marching in formation?
None of you shall cross this bridge!
What nerve!
March right over them!
Wait, stop.
Wait! Wait.
Oh... Sir Oishi!
And there's Okano.
Bravo! It must have been satisfying to release such pent-up rage!
Last night, we descended on our sworn enemy's estate...
...and achieved our long- cherished goal.
Now we withdraw to our Lord's ancestral temple of Takanawa Sendaiji.
As one warrior to another,
I beg you will cede us the bridge.
As a man I would. However...
...Ryogoku Bridge is a critical path to the main gate of Edo Palace...
...and crossing it while armed is forbidden.
But if you went to Fukagawa and crossed the bridge at Eitai...
...to get there through Shiba-Takanawa, no one would impede you.
Thank you for your kind words.
Please excuse us, then.
Turn around, men!

I remember.
Somebody!
Somebody, please!
Somebody, please!
Help me!
Somebody, help me! Please, somebody!
I'm alive! Somebody, help me!
Somebody, help me!
Please, help me.
Somebody...
Help me! I'm alive!
Somebody, help me, please!
I'm Michael.
Michael Rogan.
What's your name?
It is you.
All these weeks I was beginning to think
I was the only one left.
Now, I don't know.
Where are you from?
I was born In Rhode Island.
School, Dartmouth.
A Master of Arts In English Literature.
Gave me diction and a job as a barker on the Empire State Building.
Empire State Building.
''We are now situated on a point 102 stories In the air,
''on the highest, loftiest, man-made edifice In all the world.
''Home of the Bronx, Brooklyn,
Queens, Staten island...''
Now, that's where I was when It all began.
I ran for the elevators, something hit me.
I woke up. It was all over.
I was the only one alive.
In all of New York, the only one alive.
I began to run. lt was a nightmare.
The whole United States, wherever there had been people, that infernal radioactive dust,
It choked and It killed and It...
But there comes an end to running.
Where were you?
Where...
I'm going hunting.
I go every day.
There's nothing to hunt, but I go anyway.
I never had it so good.
A house, food, no problems.
Have you been sitting here all day?
Come on Inside. Do you want to get sicker?
You sure you don't want more?
I want to tell you.
I was In the hospital.
They took me Into the X-ray room.
All of a sudden, there was a strange noise.
I don't know what happened after that.
When I woke up,
I was lying on the bed.
Drink.
I still don't know your name.
Roseanne.
The lead shield around the X-ray room.
That's what saved you.
Why did you come here?
My mother's sister lives...
Lived here.
She was an artist.
I came here one summer.
I was so happy, I never forgot.
Who was...
 the man In the picture?
Steven.
Husband?
Yes.
Do you mind If I stay here a little longer?
I thought maybe I'd never see anyone again.
Good morning.
Good morning.
I've been waiting for you to get up.
I've gotta go get food.
There's a country store down the road.
It's about a mlle, so
I'll be gone for a while.
No.
Take me with you.
All right.
People. Where are the people?
There should be people!
-Where are the people?
-Stop thinking about it!
Stop thinking about it!
You hear me? Stop it!
New York, Cleveland, Chicago...
What I saw there was enough to crack my head open, but I stopped thinking about it.
I'd look at it, and I wouldn't see it.
That's the only way, the world that never was.
Not even a mouse.
These country stores, you got anything.
Take what you want.
Remember how important box tops used to be?
My ma, that was her big dream.
Tear off a box top, write 20 witty words and own the world.
Mall it in with 10 cents in stamps, and you'll get rich, fat and famous.
Here, madam, tear off a box top.
Come on, let's get what we need and get out of here.
It's getting cold out.
I got enough for all night.
All those years in New York, and I never saw the moonlight.
I hated New York. It was like a trap holding.
When I was a kid, we were so poor, hungry poor.
Up in the country, hunger's different, but in the city, everything there... only a piece of glass... between you and what you need.
It's done with.
Roseanne,
What about us?
No, no, no!
You little fool, there's only us.
Steven!
He's dead.
I'm here.
Stop!
I've got his baby in me!
I've got his baby!
I'm almost out of everything.
Get you some stuff tomorrow.
Take me with you.
Let's go to the city.
Maybe Steven's alive.
I don't know, but I've got to know.
Soon I won't be able to walk so far, but I'm all right now.
Please, let's go there tomorrow.
Why don't you answer me?
Do you want to kill yourself and it?
Through some miracle, we're safe here, but in the city, how do you know what would happen to you and...
But I've got to know about Steven.
All right, I'll tell you.
He's dead.
They're all dead.
Everyone!
You and I are In a dead world.
And I'm glad it's dead!
Cheap, honky-tonk of a world.
Wait!
-I never expected to see anyone.
-Why, neither did I.
A young lady.
I am Oliver B. Barn staple.
I am assistant cashier at the Santa Barbara bank.
How do you do?
How do you do?
Miracle.
When we saw that smoke in the sky from your chimney...
Another hour, and it would have been too dark.
Was it pretty rough?
The fire feels good.
Yes, it was pretty rough.
First getting locked in the vault, air got pretty bad.
He's a pretty old man.
Then when I found the inside release for the time lock mechanism...
Then we got out, then we found everybody, everybody he'd worked with all those years.
It wasn't easy on him either.
I grabbed a Jeep.
I used to drive one in the Army.
We just went off.
Went around in circles, I guess.
I wasn't exactly what you'd call normal, either, for a while.
I'd always seen the dead in their coffins.
-Anyone want some more?
-I am most content.
Full up.
Delicious and delightful.
But tomorrow we must be on our way, eh, Charles?
Yes, Indeed, vacations are delightful, but one has obligations to one's work.
Sirius,
Jupiter.
I once bought a book on the constellations.
An impractical investment.
I never got a chance to look at it.
We're quite an institution, you know,
3 quarters of a million in capitalization.
Do you mind if I stroll out on the point and look at the glories of nature?
One must enjoy one's vacation while one can, you know.
Of course.
-Be careful, sir.
-I'll be quite all right.
I... want to say something.
What I said before,
I don't know whether It's true anymore.
We're alive, now those two.
I don't know.
I got a place fixed up down there.
I think perhaps Mr. Barn staple had better stay here tonight.
No, my dear young lady.
No, Indeed.
For 40 years
I've wanted to sleep under the stars.
I never did, you know.
It gets quite cold here.
It's all right, there's a couch.
Come along.
I am tired.
-lt won't embarrass you?
-No.
On the way... did you see anything alive?
Just a few birds.
He keeps talking about bank statements.
Yes, ma'am.
Before he got sick... he was a pretty bright man in his cage,
Mr. Barn staple was, but when he got out, found all the people he'd been working with just lying there, well, you might say he was sort of like a machine, with no one left to press the buttons.
-We'll take care of him.
-Yes, ma'am.
-Charles?
-Yes, ma'am?
Did you have a family?
Yes, ma'am.
Excellent investment, a house.
What's your husband's business?
-He's an architect.
-Excellent, excellent.
We do a great deal of business with architects and builders.
Our escrow department is most efficient.
Did I fall down?
I don't remember.
I must have bruised myself.
I seem to be bleeding under my skin.
Many places.
I think it's radiation poisoning.
How do you know that?
I don't know.
I'm guessing.
But after Hiroshima, the magazines ran pictures. It looks the same.
-But you're not sure?
-No, I'm not sure.
Good morning.
How's the laundry business?
I can't turn off the faucet.
How is he?
Sleeping.
Three days sleeping.
Charles, can you give me a hand?
Okay.
Madam, I hereby tender my resignation.
I am entering the broader field of the building trade.
Miss, Miss Roseanne.
Where'd you get all this wood?
Forestry station, two valleys over.
There's an electric generator over there.
-Is that a fact?
-Yeah.
Electric light.
Now, that would be something.
Then maybe we could find me a washing machine.
Then I could fix me up a meter, send me a bill every month.
Of course, I wouldn't pay it, so that would force me to disconnect myself.
Did you ever stop to think?
A world without any bills.
Charles, Charles!
Hi.
Michael, Charles.
-What's the matter?
-He's awake and he wants to go down to the ocean.
Ocean?
What are you talking about?
He seems perfectly rational, but he says he wants to go down to the ocean right away.
Oh, yes.
-I think he's better.
-Yes.
-How about you?
-I'm fine.
I've never asked you before, but I've got to, so here goes, when does...
I'm not sure.
Three months maybe.
Did I ever tell you?
When I was a very young man,
I always wanted to go to sea.
I don't remember why I didn’t.
He'll be all right.
Coney island.
What did you say?
I was thinking of Coney island on a day like this.
Do you know Coney island?
There's people.
Hundreds of thousands of them, jammed together, body to body, trying to get a little sun, a little fresh air, and I with them.
I still see lt.
What's the matter with me?
Michael!
Michael!
Come on!
Last driftwood on the beach.
How do you feel now, mister?
The last survivors.
I have listened to the stories of your individual miracles.
Now I'll tell you of mine.
I was on the mountain when it happened.
The mountain.
Everest.
Surely you heard of our exploration.
No matter.
I alone. lt was a great blizzard.
For five days,
I was marooned on the final ridge.
When I returned to the base camp,
5,000 feet below, they were all dead.
I made my way across Asia, to the coast.
Again, I was the only living thing.
I found a boat.
I went to Hawaii.
Again, a mountain of dead.
I found a plane.
I decided to try America.
I ran out of petrol a few hours ago.
I climbed Mount Everest.
I alone.
Always alone.
Now there are you.
We are quite the community.
Mike, Roseanne, come here!
What was wrong?
He just died.
I'll stay.
You come back for us.
No. I'll bury him here.
You take Roseanne home.
No, I'll stay.
-Don't you think you'd better come along?
-No.
Charles,
It's all right.
He loved the sea.
She shouldn't be climbing up and down that hill.
She wants to feed the man.
He's not that sick!
What's gonna be with Roseanne when her time comes?
I don't know.
If my old father could see me now.
Why?
He used to wave the Bible at me and say,
''In the sweat of thy face shall thou eat bread.''
How about the bank?
No sweat of your face?
''Good morning, Mr. Harrison.
Good morning, Mr. Adams.
''Good morning, Mr. Palmer.''
What did you want to do, Charles?
I wanted to be a teacher.
Why didn’t you?
Lost my way somewhere, I guess.
First a girl, a decent suit, then after a while, I guess, what I wanted more than anything else was a little piece of security,
9:30 to 4:00,
$38.50 a week, every week.
Security.
Well, how is the agricultural project going?
We don't know if the seed will grow.
Why not?
Things are so strange.
Birds, no animals.
So many things I don't understand.
-How do you feel?
-Fine.
I think I'd better see how the farmers are doing.
Isn't that a misdirection of energy?
Why this return to primitiveness?
The shelves of the cities are bursting with food,
 a lifetime of food.
Michael doesn't want to go near the cities.
Do you want to stay here?
I have to now.
I mean, after your child.
I think I will try to get up tomorrow.
That's wonderful, Eric.
You're very sweet.
Everybody, come on! Hurry, come on!
-Take it easy.
-What could it be?
It's growing at last.
So.
Pretty good for city folks, huh?
Corn on the cob.
I was a fool.
That long, terrible trip to reach here, endless days at sea, alone, always alone.
Now I have found my civilization.
As long as things keep growing, everything will be all right.
Yes, I know.
Nature so arranges it that when a woman ls in your condition, clouds are like rainbows and all the world ls like a cradle.
Hey, they're on! They're on!
How wonderful!
Music.
I wanted it so much.
We found a hundred records.
I wish I could dance.
Me! You sit. I'll do it for you.
It'll keep burning.
There's plenty of gas In the generator.
I keep thinking how I never saw the lights.
All my life In the city, and I never saw them.
Very nice!
And here I thought you were sewing booties.
-lt is very nice.
-Thank you.
You have done enough work for one day.
Come outside and talk to me.
I'd like to finish the sewing.
That corn out of the can was mighty tasty tonight.
The blessing of our age, the American canning industry.
And yet, it debased your taste downto the level of baked beans and hash.
I didn’t notice any leftover beans on your plate tonight.
When in Rome, eat swill like the Romans.
I'd like to go places tonight and have a big time, order a double-decker hamburger with onions, a side order of French fries and a double chocolate malt.
Spareribs. Barbecued spareribs.
I can smell them.
I'd like strawberries, strawberries and cream.
Where I lived, the smell of traffic.
From morning to night, you could smell the traffic.
Telephone.
If I could hear a telephone ringing...
A New York cop, even a New York cop bawling out a hack driver.
Where I lived, the faucet was always dripping.
If I could just hear that dripping.
Of all those things, which would you like the most?
I don't know.
Kids raising the devil around the supper table.
I hardly think this is the time for nostalgic sentimentality.
I've been giving a great deal of thought to why we are alive.
Of course, there's a definite primary reason why he and you and I escaped the radiation.
I was at a tremendous height and you two behind metal at the bank vault, the X-ray room.
And, yet, what about you?
You had no such protection.
And what about the old man who died
In spite of having the same protection as this one had?
The answer to me is obvious.
Immunity.
Simply because there is something within our bodies, a chemistry which gives us special immunity to that which killed the others.
I see the doubtful look on your faces.
Then mark this: during the Middle Ages, when the Black Plague swept all Europe, when man died by the hundreds of thousands, why didn’t all mankind die?
The deadly organisms were there.
There was no protection against them, and yet a small percentage of people lived on, as we have lived, with the rest of the world of men dropping dead around them.
The answer then was immunity to the organisms, and the answer here today is immunity against the radiation.
If what you say is true, then there are others.
Of course.
Throughout the world there will be others who have our sort of immunity.
Not many, only a few perhaps, but very definitely existing as we are here.
Some will die from the lingering radiations, but a small number will live as we have lived.
-That gives you hope, doesn't it?
-Yes.
Well, that's just a theory, and a theory's just a bunch of words set front to back.
But a theory becomes a fact with proof, and that is the very reason we should go into the cities and look for these people who might be alive.
We'll never know waiting here.
She will never know if her husband is dead or alive.
Tomorrow will be a good day to start.
Don't you agree?
She's not well enough to travel.
Anyway, we're safe here.
We don't know what would happen to us in the cities.
Michael, I was thinking, with your primitive mind and timidity,
In a few years, you'll be swinging from the branches of the trees.
Fortunately, I, and I believe I speak for Roseanne as well, am not quite satisfied with this return to nature of yours.
Not when the cities are open, waiting treasure chests.
Everything in the world is there for us, everything for the taking.
And beyond that, what of the others who are alive?
I want to get them together in one place.
Why?
So they can beat their heads on the ground for King Eric the First?
The man who climbed
Mount Everest?
Michael, I do want to go to the city.
If we drive carefully, I'll be all right.
But you won't be all right.
Don't you understand?
It's the cities themselves.
Where the bombs fell, the radiations are thickest.
Why don't you listen to me?
He talks about immunity.
Have you got immunity to dead, piled up like cord wood with the flesh off their bones?
I want to know what's happened out there, too,
 but Mike’s right.
We don't know what would happen there.
We know we're all right here.
Who, In God's name, asked you your opinion?
But I'm talking to her.
And I'm telling you to shut up.
I've had enough of this Interference.
Where have I Interfered with you?
That is the question.
Your very presence is distasteful to me, that I must eat with you, sleep under the same roof with you.
-Now It's out.
-Now It's out.
No, in this world, you must face really.
It is a mistake he is alive.
All right, let him go live somewhere else, not with you, not with me!
Do you hear me?
I want you out of here now.
No! Eric!
It's like lt never was before.
''And God stepped out on space
''And He looked around and said 'I'm lonely,
I'll make me a world'
''Then God smiled
And the light broke
''And the darkness rolled up on one side
''And the light stood shining on the other
''And God said, 'That's good!'
''Then God reached out and took the light in His hands
''And God rolled the light around in His hands
''Until He made the sun
''And He set that sun a-blazing
In the heavens
''And the light that was left from making the sun.
''God gathered it in a shining ball and flung lt against the darkness...
''Spangling the night with the moon and the stars.
''Then down between
The darkness and the light...
''He hurled the world
''And God said, 'That's good!'
''Then the green grass sprouted...
''And the pine tree pointed his finger to the sky,
''The lakes cuddled down in the hollows of the ground,
''And the rivers ran down to the sea,
''And up from the bed of the river
God scooped the clay,
''And by the bank of the river
He kneeled Him down
''And there the great
God Almighty
Who lit the sun and fixed it in the sky
''Who flung the stars to the most far corner of the night
''Who rounded the earth
In the middle of His hand
''This Great God
''Like a mother bending over her baby kneeled down in the dust
''Tolling over a lump of clay
Till He had shaped it
In His own image
''Then Into it He blew the breath of life
''And man became a living soul
''Amen''
Here he is.
He.
Thank you, Michael.
I still think you should be In bed.
Listen, mister, who's the doctor on this case?
That's right. Don't argue with a specialist.
Michael, is that the baby?
I'll go see.
-He was snoring.
-He was not.
It's all right. I told him to turn over.
Roseanne, when are you gonna give him a name?
Soon, I hope.
Why not now?
This is as good a time as any.
You can't keep on calling him ''Baby.''
How about Guthrle or Glenn or Leroy?
Yeah, or Ralph or Sylvester or Nathaniel or Gustaf...
No!
I don't want to name him now.
I want to wait until I find out...
 about his father.
Does your shoulder still hurt?
No, It's doing fine.
Where's Eric?
He took the jeep early this morning and went off somewhere.
I think we better talk about him now.
He seems to think the fact he's sorry settles everything.
As far as I'm concerned, nothing’s settled.
Maybe the answer is for me to go away.
Look, we've got too little a world left to run away.
We're here, all of us.
Eric’s got to understand that once and for all, and right away.
And what if he doesn't?
Then he's got to get out.
Don't you agree?
I don't know.
I don't think it's right.
You said there can't be anymore running away, and you're right.
At the same time, have we the right to send anyone away?
Anyway, the way
I've got it figured out,
it isn’t me or you he hates.
He's right, Michael.
Well, this is an occasion.
-How do you feel?
-All right.
I brought you a few things.
Thank you.
I found a place over the ridge.
Some wealthy man built himself quite a beautiful place.
Many things there we could use.
We've been talking about you.
Is that a fact?
I think I'll go In.
Thank you, Charles.
Thank you for the things.
Not at all.
It's very nice to see you up and about.
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you.
Yes?
I said we've been talking about you.
You're repetitious.
Listen, Eric.
Maybe we're the only ones left on Earth, and well, maybe it's true there are others left besides us.
Either way, It's like the world was starting all over a Gain.
We've got a new chance... to make the world what everybody used to talk about.
We've got that chance, let's make the most of it.
Let's not make the mistakes they did, the millions of them.
Let's not be at each other's throats.
Let's work together, live together, like friends.
May I have a cigarette?
Look, Michael, we've all been living under a great state of tension.
That is my only excuse for what happened, but I think lt is a valid one.
The tensions are over.
What more can I say?
I've got to fix the roof tomorrow.
Will you give me a hand?
Of course.
-Do you need help unloading the jeep?
-Yes.
I'll give you a hand.
Thank you. I'll be with you In a moment.
That crazy idiot.
Why does he do it?
Some people have to climb mountains to justify their existence.
Sit In the shade.
How about you?
Aren't you happy here?
Yes.
We could be happy now.
I'm full of so many things to say to you,
I lost them all.
Roseanne, listen.
I'm just an ordinary guy who happens to be here.
I thought I was alone, and it didn’t matter much.
People hadn't meant much to me.
When you first got here, well, you were just a woman, but now you're Roseanne.
I think of you when I work, when I plan, so much I want to do.
Oh Michael.
Those filthy scavengers.
I saw them In the city.
It's getting late.
It's Charles! What's he doing down here?
The baby!
Charles, is the baby all right? is the baby all right?
Sure. Sleeping.
Eric?
I saw him from the terrace.
-Deliberately drove the jeep through lt.
-Charles!
-ls he all right?
-Yes.
-How terrible! How did...
-Animal.
We don't know what kind.
Why did you do it?
Why did I do what?
Charles worked like a dog to make it grow.
Why did you do it?
All the food we could possibly want is in a thousand warehouses.
If the man persists in working like an animal, let him work.
I was tired.
I took the short route back.
Get out! Get out now!
I'll go.
In my own time.
It sure is hot tonight.
Sure wish we could find us an electric dishwasher.
We're going to get dishpan hands.
I told him to get out.
What did he say?
He showed me a gun and said he'd leave In his own time.
He's sleeping.
Did you finish the dishes?
All starched and ironed.
Why didn’t Eric come up for dinner tonight?
Guess he went off somewhere.
Well, he'll never know what he missed.
What's the matter?
Was there ground glass In the soup?
No. That was a mighty fine dinner.
I'm just so full
I haven't got any room for conversation.
Good night, everybody.
-Good night, Charles.
-Good night, Charles.
What's the matter, Michael?
I want to tell you something.
What you said today... made me very happy, like I used to be.
I forgot everything except being alive, being with you.
Oh, Steven.
-Yes?
-Eric.
I've got to talk to you right away.
I'm very tired, Eric.
I'm going away tonight.
-Tonight?
-Yes.
I've got to find out once and for all about those other people.
I owe it to them.
I owe it to myself.
-Will you be back?
-Yes. Of course. In a few days.
And then I'll know once and for all where we stand.
Your husband...
If I find him, I'll bring him back with me.
We're a group of living miracles, why not he?
Yes.
What am I talking about?
I don't even know what he looks like.
I'll go with you.
I have the jeep packed at the bend of the road.
Shouldn't we tell?
No, definitely no.
Michael... who knows what he will do or say?
Now we can go without any quarreling, come back, there'll be no trouble at all, but of course we'll take the child.
Come. Pack your things.
I'll meet you at the jeep In 20 minutes.
All right?
-Yes.
-Good.
I thought I was the only one who couldn't sleep.
Where you going?
What's wrong?
What's happening up there?
It's all right, darling.
We'll be going soon.
I'm sorry.
It took longer than I thought.
Was anyone awake?
No.
Well, we're really on our way.
Too bad you can't drive.
Let me sleep until I wake up.
Roseanne! Roseanne!
Steven! Steven!
Where have you been? Get In! Get In!
You should have been with me.
I told you... the whole world, a waiting treasure chest.
Could we go now?
I'll get something better.
Ever think you'd own the world?
-Couldn't we go back now?
-Back where?
You little fool.
I got you away.
You don't think I'm gonna take you back?
I'll get another car.
Where do you think you're going?
Get back In that car.
Come on!
Stay with me as long as I want you!
What's the matter?
What's the matter?
What's the matter?
There's nothing. There's nothing.
There's nothing!
Roseanne!
Roseanne.
My baby's dead.
If you could cry.
I want to help you.

Since the world began, ever-inventive man has constantly pushed forward into the unknown.
One by one, the frontiers of science have fallen before him, the science of speed, travel, radio.
Now he stands on the threshold of a new age, a terrifying age.
Man goes forward into the unknown.
But how does the unknown react?
The unknown planet,
Planet X.
All righty, Dr. Laird.
Right.
Circuit A.
Circuit A.
Circuit B.
Circuit B.
All right, Gil, put in GF2.
Yes, sir.
Gently.
Gently.
GF2 entered.
Sayers, you fool, get away from there!
- Morning, Wilson.
- Good morning, Brigadier.
- Please sit down.
- Thank you.
I take it you've come about Laird.
Yes. He's got to stop,
Wilson.
That'll be your recommendation to the committee?
Of course.
Don't you agree?
You're thinking of this business of Sayers.
Well, I'm thinking of the cost.
By the way, I've replaced Sayers.
The devil you have.
No alternative while the present setup lasts.
We're committed to two assistants.
Well, the sooner we close the whole project down, the better.
Now, look, Wilson, I am just a plain bone-headed brass hat.
I wouldn't say that, Brigadier.
You would, and you jolly well do, I know.
It's true anyway.
But I do know when an experiment is successful.
And I do know when it's costing the Earth, even though I don't fully understand it.
I don't suppose there are more than half a dozen people who do understand precisely what it is that Laird is trying to achieve.
- Then why on Earth...
- As far as Laird is concerned, his work is pure research.
Pure baloney.
But the practical implications may well affect thinking on defense matters.
That is why we are financially supporting the project.
Financially supporting?
Do you know how much money we've poured down that drain to date?
A quarter of a million pounds.
Can you justify that?
Can Laird?
Justify?
Has anyone ever been able to justify pure research at the time?
Without it, no radio, no television, no radar, no guided missiles.
Is Laird onto something like that?
Laird is engaged on experiments which aim to study the changes, if any, in the nature and properties of metals, living tissues and other materials when introduced into powerful magnetic fields.
I know. I know. I can read.
Right.
If Laird can produce a magnetic field more powerful than any that has been produced before, if he can demonstrate that important changes do occur...
Has he?
He's nearly bumped off Sayers, and he's having trouble with his equipment.
He was on the phone this morning.
- He's asking for more and more.
- More?
Oh, this is preposterous.
I'm going straight down there this morning to get to the bottom of this piece of folly.
That might be a good idea, Brigadier.
Seriously, though, Laird tells me he's already had some limited success.
- You might check on that.
- I certainly will.
Oh...
I promised to send him this.
Perhaps you would take it.
- What is it?
- A piece of metal, an alloy, such as used in aircraft.
What's Laird supposed to do with that?
Tell him if you'd like.
Oh, I'd love to.
In that case, you'd better take this piece, too.
I'd like to think that one experiment at least was some use to the country.
- Is this the same?
- Well, actually, no.
I want testing on both eventually.
- You going straight away?
- Yes, this morning.
Good. We have to soften the old boy up on his new assistant.
- It's a woman.
- A woman?
- Yeah.
- I can hardly wait to tell him.
Well, here we are.
Oh, Gil, this is Brigadier
Cartwright from the Ministry.
- How do you do, sir?
- How do you do?
This is Gil Graham,
Brigadier, my chief assistant.
He's from McGill in Canada.
A fine university.
Thank you, sir.
My other assistant was injured.
We're expecting another one today.
Oh, Lord. I am sorry.
I had forgotten.
I was to tell you your new assistant is a woman.
A woman?
You must be joking.
- Oh, he has to be joking.
- I'm afraid not.
There's no one else available to operate this computer of yours.
But a woman, this is preposterous.
This is highly skilled work.
She's very highly qualified, Doctor.
Yeah, I know the type... frustrated, angular spinster, very dedicated to her calling, without a sense of humor, bossy and infuriatingly right every time.
Sorry. I know how you feel.
I'm not having this.
I'll go up and see Wilson.
Look, Doctor, don't you think you'd better show me what you've brought me down here to see?
Maybe you won't need an assistant soon.
Very well.
Bend this.
This is a piece of copper.
So is this.
Bend it.
But this is flexible like steel.
Precisely.
Dr. Laird,
I'll take these GF2 figures to your office.
This is really most remarkable.
It has had its molecules realigned in there.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
I was told to come down here.
Who did you want to see?
Dr. Laird. Are you...
No, no. I'm Gilbert Graham, his assistant.
Oh. I was told to report here.
He's right here in the laboratory.
Oh, uh, are you the new comp operator, the replacement for Sayers?
Yes, I am. I heard about Nicky Sayers.
I'm terribly sorry.
Oh, I don't know.
Weren't you expecting me?
Not exactly.
You're French, aren't you?
Yes, I am.
Are you surprised?
- Very agreeably so.
- Thank you.
I think that Dr. Laird will be, too.
How is he to work with?
Oh, he's great... as long as you stand up to him.
I see.
Oh, Mr. Graham, can I have a word with you?
Certainly.
This is Michele Dupont.
General Cartwright.
How do you do?
How do you do?
As soon as I see her in to Dr. Laird,
I'll meet you up in the office.
Yes.
Excuse me.
Now, this business of altering the molecular structure of metals, has he got any defense angle?
Well, if the molecular structure of the alloys used in building an aircraft were to be altered, the plane would probably crash.
Remember Comet 1?
Oh, yes, yes, of course.
But research of that nature into metal fatigue and all that sort of thing, that's already being carried on elsewhere.
- Well, not quite, sir.
- How do you mean?
Well, our research may lead to the discovery of means to crash an enemy's aircraft.
You aren't suggesting, I take it, the enemy would allow us to cook his airplane alloys in that contraption of yours?
Well, I don't think that'd be necessary.
Let me try to explain.
Magnetism is a force, the only force other than gravity.
They may be one in the same thing that operates over a distance.
I see you have nine circuits in operation here and only one in reserve.
Is that not rather dangerous?
This infernal machine has only 10 circuits, and I need as many surges as I can get.
The thing is supposed to compute and then fire the electrical impulses.
I use a field of high intensity but short duration.
I understand.
Nevertheless,
I think you should have at least three in reserve and one overriding spare, and I mean one not in actual use.
That would give me only six charges, and it isn't enough.
I see you don't understand this machine.
Each circuit is capable of use over and over again.
If it has a few microseconds to clear itself, that means you can have as many surges as you like in banks of three.
Yes.
Yes, of course.
Do you mean that
Laird could produce a magnetic field powerful enough to reach out beyond the machine, beyond the house?
Well, from what the people down in the village are saying, he's done it already, spasmodically.
Is it true?
Do you think so?
I don't know.
Sometimes I wonder.
Look here, Graham, be honest about this.
It's important.
Are you saying all this just to try and save the project?
No, I'm not.
I'm not at all sure
I want to save it, not if...
Not if what?
Well, there are dangers, the imponderables.
Look, I've got a piece of airplane alloy here.
Would Laird experiment on this, do you think?
Well, if our new assistant can get the computer going, we might try it tonight.
Let's go and find out.
Oh, I wouldn't say anything to Dr. Laird about the effects over a distance, not yet anyway.
Mm-hmm.
Come in, Miss Dupont.
Gil, Gil, you were hopelessly wrong.
Miss Dupont is brilliant and not at all bossy.
She's not a bit frustrated, and I think she's quite good-looking.
Don't you?
What do you think, Brigadier?
Oh, I'm of your opinion, Doctor, though I know nothing about computers.
She's fixed it, Gil.
We've got all the power we need... for the time being.
That's fine. The brigadier would like for us to cook this tonight.
And why not?
You'll stay and watch us?
Yes, I think I will.
It should be interesting.
Hello.
Hello.
Have you got one yet?
No.
Jane!
What do you mean talking to that tramp?
- How dare you?
- He's nice.
I met him in the woods yesterday.
- What?
- He likes insects, too.
He's promised to give me a flea when he can catch one.
I'll give you a flea.
Come on in this minute.
How many times have I told you not to speak to strange men?
Tell me, what do you do for entertainment here?
- Entertainment?
- Yes.
Well, we have television.
Of course, we don't have much time for that sort of thing.
Once in a while,
I combine my pleasures and watch it down at the village pub.
Oh, I adore village pubs.
Do you often go?
Often as I can. Like to join me sometime?
- I'd love to.
- Good.
Better warn you, though, we're not very popular down there.
No? Why?
Well, they seem to think that some of our activities up here create some odd interferences in their TV and radio.
- Is it possible?
- Dr. Laird doesn't think so.
And you, do you think so?
Could be.
Is... is what we're doing dangerous?
Not yet.
But then you were thinking of Sayers.
No, I was not thinking of that kind of danger.
- That's to be expected.
- Yes.
You know, I've been thinking.
You don't have to stay here.
I mean, you'll be going back to France pretty soon.
Why not?
I'm not scared, Mr. Graham.
No, of course not.
You know, we're all kind of, as the English say,
"matey" around here.
Makes things easier.
Think you can manage to call me by my first name?
Gil,isn't it?
- Gil.
- Oh.
I saw your name in the letter you brought.
- Michellin?
- Michele.
Oh, that's it, Michele, yes.
I like that. It suits you.
You didn't answer my question.
- About the danger?
- Yes.
You see, I'm no expert in magnetic fields, but it just occurred to me this field
Dr. Laird is using here, well, it's a very large field, isn't it?
I mean, isn't it possible?
Could it spread outwards?
Dr. Laird doesn't seem to worry.
Laird. You're always telling me what Laird thinks or doesn't think.
I'm asking you.
I think you're a very clever young woman.
Mm-hmm. I see.
And bossy?
- Oh, now, wait a minute.
- Frustrated?
Look, Michele, you're taking unfair advantage.
I mean, after all,
I didn't know you then.
What I mean is the female scientist types that I've always known were, uh, shall we say, different.
Mm-hmm. I'm sure.
Well, I think we'll call the others.
Oh, Michele, look, your letter of introduction... what I mean is, is there anything besides your name?
Oh, yes.
Bachelor of science.
- Yeah, but...
- And mademoiselle.
Mademoiselle.
Well, that do make it nice.
That's American slang.
It means that do make it nice.
Oh.
Well, Doctor, I'd like to get back tonight.
Do you think we could start?
Certainly, if that remarkable young lady has finished her work.
Shall we go down?
Oh, by the way, have you a watch?
Yes.
I should leave it here if I were you.
Watches are delicate mechanisms.
They're best not taken too near magnetic fields.
All metals in the lab are either nonmagnetic or have been demagnetized.
I see.
There's no danger, of course.
All right, Gil, switch on the recorder.
We record everything, Brigadier.
It's useful for checking later.
But surely tapes are magnetic.
Very smart, Miss Dupont, and you're quite right.
No, we don't use tapes.
We have a microphone, and we record on disc in the next room.
Switch on the generators, Gil.
I'll take the circuits.
- But, Dr. Laird...
- Over here, Brigadier.
Do sit down, Brigadier.
Thank you.
Circuit A on.
Computer?
Computer on.
Circuit B on.
Integrate.
Integrating.
Ten... hold.
- All ready, Gil?
- All set, sir.
Right, steady now.
GF2.
Gently.
Gently.
GF2, over.
Three banks under reserve in operation, Doctor.
Good.
Switching off power!
Look out, Michele!
What the devil are you doing?
Good heavens, sir.
Are you hurt?
No, I don't think so.
Must be the rough skin.
Oh, I'm sorry.
It was the only thing to do.
- What happened?
- I don't know.
I'm sorry.
It was my fault.
I left my keys in there.
That was very careless of me.
You seem to have been successful, Doctor.
Look. What's that?
All in the "Standard"!
All the latest!
Big storm on the south coast!
All in the "Standard"!
Big storm on the south coast, all the latest!
Ah, let's see.
Ah, yes.
Quote, "Is space travel..."
No, no. Unquote.
I'm sorry, yes. Let's see.
Quote,
"Could they invade us?"
Unquote. Yes, something like that.
Then, we will carry a follow-up on page three with readers' letters.
They'll have seen hundreds of ruddy flying saucers by the time we're through with them.
Okay.
Who exactly is invading us? Mars?
Hey? Oh, oh, no.
They won't like that.
- Who? The Martians?
- Um, idiot, no. The...
No, make it... make it, uh...
Yes, that's it, Planet X.
The invasion from Planet X.
Well, that was some of your bold fast, if you don't mind my saying, sir.
Yesterday you're all for folding up poor old Lair.
Today, you tell the committee...
Look, Wilson, I couldn't say all I wanted to in front of the committee.
Hey, they're supposed to be in the picture.
- They have to decide...
- No, the picture's changed.
This affair is too big for the committee to handle.
There are security risks.
I'm afraid I don't quite follow.
You showed us the alloy, and I'll admit it was most impressive, but we knew something of this before.
I showed you and the committee one piece of alloy, the piece Laird put into his apparatus.
Now, this is the other piece you gave me.
Look.
Now, that remained in this case during the whole experiment.
It and the case and the hook it was hanging from ended up by flying right across the laboratory and almost injuring the new assistant.
Not another one.
Oh, she's all right thanks to Gil Graham.
But don't you see?
This wasn't in the confounded witch's cauldron.
I see.
Do you? Look at this.
That fell off the TV area along Laird's roof.
It's a different alloy, but it's gone the same way as the rest, at least 30 feet away from the apparatus.
You know what you're saying, don't you?
Yes. Action at a distance, the military's dream.
Look, Wilson, from now on, this is top security.
All right. We'd better call in
Jimmy Murray in that case.
Yes, I think we'd better.
Come in.
Hi. How are you feeling?
Broken neck would feel worse, I guess.
Do you always take your female assistants in a low-flying tackle like that?
Depends on the mood.
When I'm away from an intense magnetic field, my technique's a little different.
I should hope not.
You didn't come here to demonstrate, did you?
Might be kind of interesting.
- Help yourself.
- Thanks.
No. As a matter of fact, Michele,
I... I have something else on my mind.
Can't say I'm sorry.
What's the trouble?
Before I grabbed you last night,
I switched off the power from the generators.
Yes?
That should've shut the whole machine off at once.
Well, it did surely.
Laird was pretty furious.
Think back for a minute, Michele.
- Must I?
- Please.
Okay.
After we hit the floor, the... the briefcase flew across the room into the computer.
Correct.
GF2 was arcing then.
Right.
Then, how the devil could that be?
With the current off, the whole contraption should've been dead.
That's right, but...
There's another thing, too.
Of course, that screaming noise!
Yeah, well, then I'm not crazy.
- You do remember.
- Yes.
The circuits continued to operate after I'd switched off the power.
But, Gil, what are we saying?
This is completely ridiculous.
You couldn't have switched it off.
Yes, I did. I checked the switch this morning.
There was no current flowing from the generator when GF2 arced, when that briefcase flew across the room, and while the circuits continued to scream.
- There's one way of checking.
- How's that?
- The recording.
- Of course.
What's the matter with me?
- Come on!
- Wait.
- What? What's the matter?
- I'm still creaky.
- Let me give you a hand.
- Thanks.
You don't look all that fragile, you know.
This is the bit.
Listen.
Switching off power!
Look out, Michele!
Well?
Gil, what does it mean?
I don't know.
That apparatus was receiving power from some place, somehow.
The storm maybe?
No. That's absurd.
But very likely.
Gil?
I'm scared.
Yeah, well, so am I, Michele.
So Laird's circus gets top security rating?
That's about it, Jimmy.
Well, if you both think so.
Don't you?
Frankly, Brigadier,
I just don't register yet.
What you have been telling me sounds, well...
I know. I know.
But you will take my word for it at the moment.
Okay. But what with you and Laird, freak storms, and the press going to town about flying saucers and invasions from Planet X,
I'm beginning to feel like Dan Dare.
Am I likely to meet any little green horrors with eyes on the ends of their whiskers?
I don't think that at all likely, though you may meet some characters with snow on their boots, if you know what I mean.
Yes, I know.
And you know we've had a call from Air Force security saying that three of their radar stations report sighting some unidentified object?
Do you think there's any connection between this and Laird's work?
I don't know.
I just don't know, but we must take every possible precaution.
You and Wilson travel down separately.
Okay.
Wilson will supervise the ordering and delivery of Laird's new equipment.
It's going down in plain vans.
- Watch it, Murray.
- I will.
And remember, Wilson, you must impress on Laird the importance of a wide margin of safety this time.
Laird seems to be a tricky customer to give advice to.
He is. In fact, he's more than tricky. He's...
Oh, well, I suppose you must make some allowance for genius.
And work in close touch with Graham.
I'm pretty sure he's aware of the risk.
And they must understand the whole aim of the project now is to make the force directional.
Right, sir.
Keep in touch, and the best of luck.
I hope that fence will work.
It's costing enough.
Yeah, it should form an anti-magnetic screen.
Particularly ugly one.
There ought to be a law about corrugated iron.
Another lorry load of cabins arriving.
You know, this is getting a bit ridiculous.
Besides, creating a condenser to make it look like a sight board is darned expensive.
I'd better go down and check it in.
Right. Oh, Gerald, when you're finished,
I'd like to have a private word with you.
Okay, I'll be back.
All right.
Did I frighten you? I'm sorry.
I'm not frightened. I... I was just going home anyway.
I don't know you.
What is your name?
- Smith.
- Smith?
We've got a teacher at school called Smith.
Are you her husband?
No.
Good. I hate her.
She threw my bugs away.
- Bugs?
- Mm-hmm.
She called them insects, of course.
She's very stupid.
And weren't they insects?
Some were. You see, all insects are bugs, but all bugs are not insects.
And is that what you were doing just now, collecting bugs?
- What were you doing?
- Oh, nothing.
Um, please, I was just trying to find my way.
My goodness.
Are you lost?
Yes.
Fancy getting lost in Bryerly Woods.
Is this Bryerly Woods?
Of course it is.
Everyone knows that.
Are you a foreigner?
You look like one.
You've got funny whiskers.
Yes, I suppose I am.
At least, I came here from a long way off.
What's so funny about my whiskers anyway?
I haven't seen anyone else with funny whiskers like that.
Well, perhaps I'd better shave them off then.
I don't want want to look funny or different from anybody else.
How did you get here?
If I told you, you wouldn't believe me.
I would, you know.
Even if I said
I came on the back of a giant dragonfly?
Oh, no. There aren't any drag... dragonflies.
There are where I come from.
There aren't any drag... dragonflies anywhere.
What about on the moon then?
Oh, well, if you come from the moon, that's different.
Where are you staying?
I don't know.
As a matter of fact,
I'm looking for somewhere to stay.
I expect we could've put you up at our house, only there's a new lodger coming today.
I don't think I shall like her.
Her name's Forsyth, and she's going to be the new teacher at our school.
Is there anywhere else around here
I may be able to stay?
I don't supposed they'd put you up.
They're very narrow-minded.
Oh, of course.
Are there any big places around here, you know, factories, workshops, anything like that?
Nothing like that, only Dr. Laird's house, of course, but it's no good going there.
He's a mad inventor.
And what does he invent?
It's a secret.
No one knows.
- Well, I must go home.
- Why is Dr. Laird mad?
Almost every night, he switches on his machine and busts up all the television sets.
- Where does he live?
- It's no good.
He won't take lodgers.
You can see his house from the top of the hill.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Mm.
Now, let me get this straight.
What you're trying to tell me, as I see it, is that this fearsome contraption of yours went on working after you'd cut off the current.
Is that it?
That's it.
I speak from unfathomable depths of ignorance, but is that so very remarkable?
Of course it is.
If I switch off, say, an electric fan, wouldn't it go on turning for a while?
Momentum or something?
Yeah, but you wouldn't get an electric shock from the terminal.
Our circuit, GF2 we call it, leapt across about 5 seconds after I switched off the power.
That's impossible.
That's what I keep telling myself and Dr. Laird.
What did he say?
Same as you did... impossible.
Refuses to listen.
There's more to it than that, too, Gerald.
You know, I'm not the brains of this joint, but I've been figuring a few things out during the past 10 days.
That apparatus was building up a field far in excess of anything that we could've reasonably expected from the power we were feeding into it.
Personally, I think you're all getting slightly neurotic over this business.
Did you say you had a recording of the session?
That's right.
You ought to hear it.
Hmm. That's funny.
It's gone.
This looks like a case for Jimmy Murray.
- Where is he?
- On his way down from London.
I promised to meet him for a pint in the Crown and Mitre this evening.
You'd better come, too.
Yeah.
Shall I bring Michele?
Not necessary.
She's coming.
I asked her this morning.
Oh. I'm gonna start getting up earlier.
Aah!
Help! Help! Help!
Aah!
Help!
Are you all right?
Yes, I think so.
Wait a minute.
Thank you.
Where do you live?
Well, I'm going to Bryerly Bay.
I'm a teacher.
I started the school there on London.
Bryerly Bay? Well, after we've reported this to the police,
I'll take you there.
Please sit down, Mr. Murray.
Thank you, Inspector.
We're taking a statement from Miss Forsyth now.
I understand you're taking her home to her lodgings at Bryerly Bay.
Yes, I was taking her myself, to Dr. Laird's establishment.
Inspector, what are you going to do about this man?
Well, we'll comb the woods, of course.
But first, let me ask you a question.
Oh, I don't say I should be able to reply.
I know you security chaps, but this is important.
You see, a man has been seen in the woods, and it's been reported that he has a large burn mark on his face.
Tell me, has Laird been using radioactive materials?
I can tell you that, Inspector.
The answer is no, definitely no.
Thank you, sir.
Well, we'll have to try another line of approach.
Come in.
Miss Forsyth's ready now, sir.
Right. Just coming.
Well, goodbye, Inspector.
Goodbye, and thank you very much for all your help.
What about another drink?
Not for me, thanks.
Pass.
Do you mind if I...
No.
You're very quiet, Gil.
What's on your mind?
Oh, nothing.
Everything.
You mean you feel comme ci, comme ca?
Eh.
How long you known Gerald?
Why? Does it matter?
Sorry.
Didn't mean to interfere or intrude.
I don't want to quarrel with you, Gil.
Cheers.
I wonder where that man Murray is.
He was supposed to meet us here.
What will you have, sir?
What's that?
Well, old Boggs?
Mild and bitter.
I'll have that.
Certainly, sir.
That music you hear comes from a proper band.
- At last.
- Sorry I'm late.
Okay. Meet Michele Dupont and Gil Graham.
- How do you do?
- How are you?
- What's the trouble?
- Things have been happening.
There's a maniac at large in the woods.
- A what?
- Maniac?
Oh, there you are.
Nice of you to take me dancing.
What are all the pretty girls going to do now that they haven't got
Gene Kelly to dance with, nurse their perishing colds?
- Oh, I haven't been long.
- Oh, no.
You were going to get me a drink half an hour ago.
I thought you were going to have a nice cup of tea.
Tea? Get me a glass of nourishing stout.
All right, love.
Evening, Art.
Evening, Mrs. Packer.
Evening, Mr. Graham.
Oh, hello, Art.
Where's Gillian?
- Isn't she here?
- I haven't seen her.
Well, you see, I was supposed to be working late tonight.
And, well, she said she'd meet me here.
- Here you are.
- That's women for you.
Can't let them out of your sight.
Never mind, Art. Have a drink.
I'd expect Gillian's had to wait until her dad's got home.
She hasn't been too well lately.
No, I, uh, I think
I'll stroll down the lane and see if I can meet her.
I thought the band was noisy.
The microphone was too near the loudspeaker.
A syndrome, that's it.
That's what was the matter.
We had a syndrome in the... in the magnetic field.
Are you all right, old boy?
What the dickens are you babbling about?
You understand, don't you, Michele?
- Yes, I believe I do.
- Would you mind explaining?
Or have you both gone crazy?
Did you hear that screech from the loudspeaker?
- I'm not deaf.
- Yeah, well, look.
The microphone was too near to the speaker.
The sound goes in.
It comes out louder, back into the microphone, around and out louder still and so on and so on.
It's called a syndrome.
You mean a sort of vicious circle?
That's right. And if you don't put a stop to it, it keeps piling up and piling up until the amplifier or some part of the circuit goes bust.
I get it.
But why all the dramatics?
Have you got your car here?
Yes, why?
I want to get back to the lab.
What? Now?
I've got to see Dr. Laird right away.
You do understand, don't you, Michele?
Yes, I do. I think you ought to go.
Can't you tell us what all the excitement's about?
I'll try and explain.
You must go.
You'll be all right, won't you?
Of course.
Come on. Let's go.
Oh, Gerald, I'm sorry, but this is important.
Gil, I hope you know what you're talking about.
So do I.
Let's be practical, my boy.
You make an excellent theoretical case for the build-up in the field being syndromic.
But where exactly in the circuit does the phenomenon occur?
As I see it, it's between these two circuits.
You have a first-class brain,
Gil. It's a pity that you allow your imagination to run away with you.
Meaning what?
Meaning that, in the first place, you have reached the correct conclusion from the wrong premise.
Oh, I don't understand.
Secondly, that you are allowing a self-evident fact to scare you.
You were driven to your clever piece of reasoning by worrying about a lot of silly diddle daddle, freak storms and the like.
Haven't you considered the possibility that we might've caused some of the things which took place that night?
I never consider anything which might interfere with my research.
Seems rather short-sighted, doesn't it?
If one always stopped to calculate the risks, there would be no research.
But you think I'm right about the syndrome?
I know you're right.
I reached the same conclusion over a week ago.
Well, but you said nothing...
Because I knew you would be all for delay.
Well, wouldn't that be the wiser course, Dr. Laird?
I don't think so.
We have accidentally stumbled upon the secret of producing an enormously more powerful magnetic field than we had ever hoped for.
We have saved ourselves years of work, and you want to throw those years away.
No, I don't want to do that.
I just feel that we ought to proceed with the utmost caution.
We have new equipment, more powerful generators but the same circuits.
We have taken great precautions, the iron fence, for instance, the direction field, better insulation and the screening between the terminals of GF2.
Yes, well as I see it, the screening of the GF2 terminals is the main danger.
It's like, uh, like putting a 6-inch nail across a 5-amp house fuse.
Perhaps you would allow me to be the best judge of that.
I've been engaged in this work all my life.
Well, I'm sorry.
I... I didn't mean to sound impertinent.
Not impertinent, just frightened, and a frightened assistant is no good to me.
If you would care to terminate your appointment here?
Oh, of course not.
I...
I wouldn't think of deserting you at this stage of the game in any case.
Please do not allow questions of personal loyalty to affect you.
Under the circumstances,
I wouldn't.
I was thinking more the complicated operation of the apparatus.
It's not so complicated now, you know.
It will be possible for only one person to operate.
Yes, sir.
Gillian!
Gillian! Gillian!
Gillian.
No.
Aah!
Now then, go ahead down.
How about a drink?
Is the bar closed?
Yes, sir. The dance goes on until midnight.
It's getting very late.
Is it that I'm positively repulsive?
Or could there be someone else?
I'm afraid there is.
I'm sorry.
I just realized it now.
- Gil?
- Please, let's go.
Lucky devil.
Ah, Miss Dupont, are you going?
- Yes, why?
- It's Gillian Betts.
They've just found her.
Is young Art here?
What's happened?
An accident?
No, sir, not an accident, murder.
Murder?
Well, what's this?
In Bryerly Woods, sir.
There's a maniac.
- Are you quite sure?
- I can't say any more.
No, course not.
Darling, are you all right?
- Yes, but we can't we go?
- You are together, sir?
- Yes.
- And you have a car?
- Oh, yes.
- Then that'll be all right.
You see, we haven't found the fellow yet.
And what about you, sir?
Are you with...
No, Officer.
I am alone.
If you're going past Bryerly Woods,
I don't think you ought to be by yourself, sir.
Could I give you a lift?
Thank you.
Not at all. My car's outside.
Goodnight, miss.
Goodnight, sir.
Goodnight. I'll warn the others upstairs.
Right.
Where shall I drop you, Mr...
Smith.
If you could drop me at the other end of the village near Dr. Laird's house.
Oh, yes. We're going that way.
Thank you.
I'm just thinking, that young man went to meet Gillian.
Don't you think we should tell the police?
Yes, of course.
I'll go back in and tell him.
Will you forgive me if I take this opportunity of speaking to you?
What is it?
I overheard what Mr. Graham said tonight about syndromes.
Well?
You see, I understand something of your work.
How much?
Who are you anyway?
That is not important.
I must speak to you and Mr. Graham as soon as possible.
It will have to be tomorrow after we have finished our work at the lab.
Very well. Shall we say here at 6 o'clock?
- All right.
- Okay. I told him. Let's go.
Did he give you any clue as to why he wanted to meet you and Gil?
Not really, but he seemed to know a lot about our work.
- You didn't tell him anything?
- Of course not, Jimmy.
I'm not that stupid.
Well, I don't like it.
I just don't like it.
Who is this chap, Smith?
Know anything about him, Gerald?
Not a thing.
Gil?
I saw him for the first time tonight at the dance.
Gerald, when you took him in the car tonight, did he say where he lived?
No, he just told me to drop him near here.
Yes, he said it was okay to drop him here.
That's right. He must be staying in the village.
Well, that should make it easy for us to keep tabs on him.
Gil, Michele, you must meet him tomorrow evening as arranged.
What's the drill?
See if he tries to pump you about Laird's work.
Find out all you can.
Right.
How did Laird react to your inspiration, Gil?
What, the syndrome? Mm-hmm.
He guessed it already.
Ah, that's tough.
Is it going to foul things up?
Nope. He's pressing on regardless.
You're worried, aren't you?
I am. I'm in a bit of a fix.
I... I don't like to go behind the old man's back, but I think we're moving along a little too fast.
Hmm, that apparatus is ready to work, but nobody knows for sure what it'll do.
Doesn't Laird know?
You try asking him.
I almost got sacked tonight.
Oh, no, Gil.
Would you like me to contact Cartwright?
Well, I think we should in any case, but he better not come here, not with Laird in his present mood.
I agree.
Where then?
Oh, police headquarters.
Royal Inspector Burns ought to be put more in the picture.
We may need his help yet.
Just you say, Jimmy.
I'll phone Cartwright in the morning.
I'll meet him at the station in the car.
Well, if there's nothing else, time for bed. Would you mind?
Oh, yes.
Coming, Jimmy?
Hmm?
Oh, yeah.
I'll see you two before you meet Smith.
- Good night.
- All right. Good night.
- Good night.
- Good night.
I'm, uh, I'm sorry about tonight.
I didn't mean to butt in.
It isn't really any of my business.
Isn't it, Gil?
After you had gone,
Gerald kissed me.
Why tell me?
I'm not enjoying it.
Neither did I. Funny, isn't it?
Well, that's too bad.
I'm sorry.
Are you really?
Not really.
I enjoyed that.
Hmm, so did I.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- Feeling better?
- Yes, much better. Thanks.
This is Jane.
I'm staying at her house for the time being.
She's taking me to see her school.
I'm going to catch a beetle for her. They're horrid-looking.
I'm terribly thrilled about that.
When does school start?
On Monday. I've got the key from the head so I can look around my classroom and get everything ready.
You both like being busy, what with beetles and school.
Look, I'm rather tied up today, but I thought of taking a boat out tomorrow, Sunday.
When did you think about that?
Just a moment ago.
I can't think why.
- Care to come?
- I'd love to.
I must fly now. Got to meet my chief off the train.
Oh, by the way, Jane, ever met a man called Smith in the village?
No, but I met a Mr. Smith in the woods.
- What?
- He's nice.
He helps me look for insects.
Oh. Well, if you meet him again, try and find out where he lives, will you?
I can't.
So that's our school, Jane?
Are you going in, Miss Forsyth?
Yes, I must.
Oh, well. If you must.
And you?
I'm going to look for that beetle larvae.
All right.
But don't be late home.
- You promised your mother.
- I won't. Goodbye.
- A lot of beers here, George.
- Thank you, sir.
There we are.
Thanks.
Just right.
Thank you, sir.
All right,
Mr. Smith, shoot.
I'll come straight to the point, Mr. Graham.
I overheard your conversation last night, and that led me to suppose that you are concerned with Dr. Laird's experiments.
I see.
And what's your interest in those experiments?
Will you accept, for the moment, that it is purely scientific?
Go on.
I take a great interest in the subject of magnetic fields, Mr. Graham.
Why not? What's that got to do with Dr. Laird's experiment?
Will you also accept that
I am not a complete fool?
All right.
Thank you.
Dr. Laird is no doubt a very clever man.
He must be to have built an apparatus capable of recently causing such atmospheric disturbance.
However, I suspect he is also a single-minded man and possibly an unimaginative one.
Mr. Graham, the earth has a magnetic field.
Have you considered the dangers of upsetting that field?
It has happened before in history, you know, with catastrophic results.
Yes. Yes, I've considered the possibility.
You seem to be a remarkably well informed man, Mr. Smith.
Please go on.
There is also another danger, the danger of radioactive rays.
We're not using any radioactive materials.
I know that, but not all radioactive particles are man-made.
There is another source.
Yes, that's true.
There are cosmic rays.
They bombard us constantly, but they... they do little apparent harm.
Because you are shielded from all but the harmless ones by the ionosphere, the... the so-called heavy-side layer.
The heavier it is, the sodium, for example, never normally reach the earth.
Yes, that's true, but, uh, but I don't quite follow you.
Mr. Graham, the ionosphere could be affected by magnetism.
It could be bent or fractured.
But surely the ionosphere is 50 or 60 miles up?
And ships at sea 18 miles away were affected by your experiment.
Don't you see?
If, at the points of maximum strength of your field, the heavy side layer had been temporarily fractured or pulled down close to the earth, heavy and possibly dangerous cosmic rays could've reached the Earth's surface and may have affected many people in strange ways.
How do you mean?
I mean, they may have been driven mad.
The human beings who may have been affected by the rays will probably all die, though not before they may have killed many people.
But there is something else.
It would normally take many years for any change to become apparent in the human race or in animals with a long gestation period.
But what of the quick breeders, the insects?
Insects?
Oh, mon dieu, no.
Yes.
Some insects, ants, spiders could already have mutated.
In what way?
That is impossible to say.
They could've become a different species.
They could've become smaller or much larger.
Look, some of my colleagues are in a conference now at the police station.
Would you come along with me and state your case to them?
No, Mr. Graham.
I'd rather not.
- But why not?
- There are reasons.
Besides, they would probably regard me as a crank.
- Well, I... I don't.
- I hoped you wouldn't.
That's why I chose to speak to you.
- Well, then please...
- No, Mr. Graham.
The responsibility rests with you.
I can only wish your success.
Miss Dupont.
Well, Gil, what do you think?
I think he may be right, Michele.
Look, I... I want to go see Cartwright.
Can you make it home all right alone?
Of course.
Darling, make them believe you.
I know you can be very persuasive when you want to.
Right.
Excuse me, miss.
Being as you're a scientist,
I wish you would look at what our Jane's found.
I rung the police, but they didn't say much.
And, well, I don't like the look of it.
Do you have something to boil this in?
- Well, yes. I have.
- You boil it immediately.
- Boil it, Miss? But...
- Please, Mrs. Hale.
Don't argue. You boil it.
You understand? You boil it.
It's very dangerous.
And, incidentally, you lock your door and close all your windows and keep everybody inside.
- But what about Miss Forsyth?
- Who is Miss Forsyth?
My new lodger, the new school teacher, she's still out.
She went to the school this afternoon.
Where is the school?
Well, the quickest way is through the woods.
There's a path opposite.
Don't worry.
I'll find Miss Forsyth.
The whole idea is utter nonsense.
The chap's trying to scare us off.
I'm surprised at you, Gil.
I'm inclined to agree.
I certainly think this man, Smith, needs pulling in for further questioning.
You know anything about him, Inspector?
Not a thing.
But then there are quite a lot of Smiths about.
Exactly. He's too good to be true.
Who is he?
Where does he come from?
I can't get a lead on him anywhere.
All the same, I agree with Graham.
We must hold up all further experiments with Laird's apparatus until a thorough check-over has been made.
All right, that's agreed.
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Inspector Burns here.
Yes.
What?
Mark Davison's been found, dead, mutilated.
Oh, my.
His body was cleaned dry of blood.
You see? Smith was right.
It's those insects.
They've mutated, and they're hungry.
- Oh, come off it.
- Shut up, will you, Jimmy?
Inspector, Brigadier, you've got to cordon off those woods.
Insects are tremendous eaters.
There won't be anything left long in there.
Get me every available man.
Graham's right.
No, give me that telephone.
This is a military operation.
Get me the nearest army depot.
Aah!
Bryerly Woods.
That's it. Goodbye.
Graham, get down to the lab at once.
On no account must Laird touch that damn machine of his.
- Yes, sir.
- Where's Wilson?
He should be at Laird's house.
I'll phone him.
He can have a word with Laird.
Yes, son?
Well, Sergeant, I didn't think it was important at first, but now...
Well? Well?
Mrs. Hale, sir, she rang up to say her daughter had found a whopping great egg.
What was that?
An egg, sir.
Who said that?
Mrs. Hale, sir.
And she said that her lodger, a Miss Forsyth, was out late.
Oh, no. Does she know where she went?
She was at the village school, sir.
Gil, quick, Bryerly School!
Go back! Go back!
Aah!
Aah!
Helen! Helen!
Are you all right?
Helen?
There's another girl in the woods.
Who is it?
From, uh...
Dr. Laird's assistant.
- Michele!
- Gil, come back!
Mr. Graham!
Michele... she's in here!
I'll come with you. Hurry.
Michele!
Michele!
Wait!
What do you mean, wait!
Leave this to me!
This way.
Aah!
Oh, what is it? What is it?
I just had a message from
Brigadier Cartwright, Dr. Laird.
Oh, I can't be bothered with you or Cartwright just now.
I'm sorry, Doctor.
This is important.
So is this, much more important than anything Cartwright has to gossip about, and I'm nearly ready for testing.
It's about that. You mustn't operate the machine.
I must not operate my own apparatus?
Did you say that...
I'm afraid I did!
Some entirely new factors have arisen which make it imperative that all testing shall be indefinitely delayed.
Indefinitely delayed?
How easily wise old bureaucrats betray a red-tape fetish.
Indefinitely delayed.
There will be no delay,
Mr. Wilson.
I alone am competent to decide when this apparatus shall be tested, not some two-penny brass hat or upstart civil servant.
Now, get out!
Dr. Laird, don't be ridiculous.
Put that gun down.
You're behaving like a madman.
- Nobody wants to interfere.
- Get out!
If you say another word,
I'll shoot you.
Do you understand?
I'll shoot you.
Please listen.
This apparatus has cost lives.
It is dangerous.
Feeling better, Michele?
You're going to be all right, Michele.
Well, I think we've covered this section of the woods, Mr. Murray.
I wouldn't like that job again.
Any casualties?
It's a good job we acted when we did.
The woods were thick with eggs.
Another few days and we'd...
Yes, all right.
There is to be no relaxing.
Keep patrolling all night and tomorrow we'll have a thorough comb-out.
You better report to Brigadier
Cartwright straight away.
Right, sir.
Good Lord.
To think we have to do this in every wood in the country.
That will not be necessary,
Mr. Murray.
Hmm?
Mr. Smith.
One or two questions
I'd like to ask you.
Where do you come from?
Uh, Jimmy, uh, I'm afraid that's going to be a kind of an awkward question for him to answer.
- Isn't it, Mr. Smith?
- Yes, indeed.
Uh, you said that some of the RAF boys had reported unidentified objects flying south.
Yes, that's right.
The usual sort of nonsense.
Yes, well, this time, it wasn't nonsense,
I'm afraid.
Was it, Mr. Smith?
I landed here shortly after your first disastrous experiment.
Landed?
What are you talking about?
Well, this is difficult.
Let me put it this way,
Mr. Murray.
Without being aware of it, your newspapers were very near the truth when they spoke of mysterious invaders from Planet X.
Am I going crazy?
In fact, there was but one invader.
It was I.
Jimmy, I... I realize it's going to be a little hard for you to believe.
But the truth of the matter is, Mr. Smith is the legendary character from outer space.
Right?
Get me Brigadier Cartwright.
Hurry.
Cartwright here.
Cartwright?
Wilson here.
Listen.
Laird's gone mad.
What's that?
No. Don't talk.
Listen.
He shot me.
Come... quick.
For heaven's sake, come.
He's alone.
Wilson!
Wilson!
Wilson...
Wilson!
Wilson!
We have had your planet under close observation for many years.
Flying saucers?
That's what you have chosen to call our spacecraft.
We've also been monitoring your radio.
That's how I come to speak passable English.
But, you... you are like us.
Is that so very surprising,
Miss Forsyth?
There are many planets with the same physical conditions as here on Earth.
And, on them, life has gone through the same evolutionary processes.
Where is this Planet X?
If I were to tell you, you would neither understand nor believe me.
Time and space are still the great mysteries to you.
Why have you come to pay us this visit?
Because of your experiments in magnetism.
You brought down one of our spacecraft on the night of your experiment.
Our craft use the planetary lines of magnetic attraction as their means of propulsion.
That's why we were so concerned with your experiments, alarmed, I might say.
We had to act in what you would call enlightened self-interest.
Is that the only reason that you came?
No. We have never interfered with your development before.
But, this time, your entire planet was in danger.
It still is if you continue with your experiments.
You mean we might reverse the Earth's polarity, tilt the Earth on its axis?
Yes, I do.
It has happened before, but then the force was extraterrestrial.
I thought you said there was no further danger from these insects.
That is correct.
We were able to calculate the center of disturbance and the points of maximum intensity.
This, I assure you, is the only place on land to be affected by cosmic ray bombardment.
On land?
There were some areas in the sea.
There, life will have been spontaneously created, microscopically, just as it was millions of years ago before there was an ionosphere to protect you.
You've had a very narrow escape, Mr. Graham.
Well?
Message from Brigadier Cartwright, sir.
Will you and Mr. Graham come down to Dr. Laird's house immediately?
- What's happened?
- It's Mr. Wilson, sir.
He's been shot.
Gerald shot?
Is he...
We're afraid he's dead.
Dr. Laird seems to have gone mad, and the Brigadier's worried he may start his machines again, sir.
I was afraid of this.
We've got to stop him.
Let me come with you.
It's like I thought, locked and bolted.
We could break it down, I suppose?
We might, but it'd be a tough job.
It'd take hours.
Oh, that will be enough to set him off.
Look here, Smith.
Can you help us?
Do you really want me to?
Of course we do.
Smith, there's very little time left.
If Laird switches on that infernal machine... well, I understand you know more about these things than we do?
I do, sir.
We must stop him.
Can you help us?
Look. How about that... that gun thing, the one you used to kill the spider with?
No. I can help you, but the decision for what I do must be yours.
Go on.
It is a question of one man's life or perhaps the very existence of the Earth.
That's not a difficult decision.
For us, it would be.
Life is more simple for you.
Your press has spoken of our world as Planet X.
We too have the equivalent of X in our language.
Our children learn in their schools about the strange world of Planet X.
You mean, uh...
Yes.
Yours is the strange world, Mr. Graham.
Brigadier, if I were to destroy this machine, would you promise me not to rebuild it?
I give you my word.
Without Laird,
I don't think we could.
- Right, Graham?
- Absolutely right.
Very well.
I want you to take your men away from the house, well away.
What are you going to do?
Mr. Graham, Miss Dupont, would you come with me, please?
Now we must wait.
There it is.
Goodbye.
Will you come back?
Who knows?

Ludlow cutoff.
Foul play suspected. Send homicide details.
Oh yeah, the driver may have been William Summerfield.
177 Dakata street, Ludlow Illinois.
One of you stay on the scene, the other investigate the Ludlow address.
10-4, car 254. KLB 646.
-You heard the man.
-Yeah.
-Looks like a girls' sweater.
Bloody.
- Car 88. Come in, car 88.
- Car 88 to Havana. Mackenzie here.

- Hello, I'm at Ludlow, the whole town's destroyed.
Everybody's gone!
You gotta do something!
You won't believe this!
Send help, lot's of help, quick!
Alright, lady. Just follow the arrows.
Any chance of getting through?
- Nope.
- What happened?
- Look, lady, just stick to it, will you please?
- Tell them to take that detail out of there.
The old man is sending a replacement.
-Alright.
- I'm sorry, soldier, I should have explained.
I'm Audrey Aimes, National Wire Service.
- Yes, ma'am.
- How do I get there?
- Sorry, my orders are to let no one through.
- That surely doesn't include the press.
-I'm sorry, ma'am.
No one is what the old man said.
-Was it very bad?
Many get hurt?
- Look, lady, you're not gonna fish any information out of me.
Now, why don't you go back on the main road?
 it's about a mile south.
- I'll take the camera, ma'am.
- Oh!
No pictures allowed.
Look, you have no right to do that.
-Sorry, ma'am.
- I'd like to see your commanding officer, please.
Where could I find him?
- You'll find him in Paxton.
He headquarters there.
I'll leave your camera at the roadblock.
-Until further notice,
all traffic will continue to be
rooted around the Ludlow area
according to special orders.
- Good morning.
- I'd like to see your commanding officer, please.
-Oh, I'm sorry, but the Colonel's busy.
Perhaps Capt. Barton can help you.
- Send her in.
- OK...
- This will cover the whole situation you asked for, sir.
-Thanks, Lieutenant.
Sit down, please.
Are you the Audrey
Aimes that covered
Korea for that picture magazine?
-That's right.
- I read the book you wrote after the war.
Liked it very much.
- Well, thank you.
-You're with National Wire Service now?
- I was on my way to Chennault field to do a picture story on a new jet plane they're unavailing, and...
I ran into a roadblock.
- So?
- Well, captain, there was a town beyond that roadblock.
A town that isn't there anymore.
- Until we find out exactly what happened, we'd like to avoid publicity.
- Do you have any idea of what happened?
-I'm sorry, miss.
- Captain, you can't suppress a story like this.
- We're not trying to, Ms.
Aimes, but until we have more facts... if... would you give us your word not to release the story until we give the go ahead?
-You have my word.
- Some time during the night, the town of Ludlow was completely demolished.
The town's population, about
150 people, vanished.
- Vanished?
- No bodies, nothing.
-Well, there must be some trace.
- I know it's hard to believe, Ms. Aimes, but a special detail's gone through the wreckage for two solid hours and couldn't find a thing.
- Was it an explosion?
- We don't know.
- A hundred and fifty people just don't vanish into thin air.
- We're still trying to find out what happened.
If you'd like to sit in.
- Yes, thank you, I would.
- Dave, what time did you leave Ludlow last night?
-Roughly at night after eleven o'clock.
- My son-in-law was watching television news at 10:30, so I sat down and watched that.
And my daughter wanted me to sit there and talk about it.
And then I got to thinking that I had to get up early.
So I took off.
- Did you notice anything strange or unusual about the house or about the way the family acted?
-No. Same as always.
- When you were driving out of town, nothing out of the way in the street, the building or the sky?
No unusual light, some sound or movement?
- Well, I heard something that sounded like thunder.
And about midnight a plane went over it.
-Alright, Dave.
I can call you again if I need you?
- Oh, yeah, sure.
-Edna?
Is that the telephone company's official transcript?
- I put through the last call to Ludlow at 11:59 PM.
- And when did you first notice anything wrong with the Ludlow connection?
-4:45 this morning.
I phoned the company lines' men to go out there right away.
- So, the telephone lines could have gone down anywhere between
Alright, Edna, thanks.
You've been very helpful.
-Oh, Colonel Sturgeon,
Ms. Aimes, National Wire Service.
- How do you do?
- Audrey Aimes,
I've read a lot of your stuff, seen a lot of your photographs.
Yes?
- Set to go, sir, whenever you're ready.
-I'll be right there.
I hope you understand our problem, our need to keep this quiet.
-Yes, the Captain's briefed me.
- If anyone wants me, I can be reached in Ludlow by radio.
- Yes, sir.
- How's chances of me going along?
-Not this trip. Maybe later.
In any case, not until we know what's out there.
- Oh, by the way, Colonel, my camera was taken from me at the road block by one of your men.
-I'll give orders to have it released.
- Oh, there has to be a logical explanation for this.
A town of 150 people just doesn't disappear.
-This one did.
-Chicago mobile service operator.
I'd like to place a person-to-person call, please, to Mr.
Norman Taggart,
Editor-in-chief of National Wire Service.
The number is Murray Hill 44836.
- In what city, please?
- New York.
- Aud, you wind up that jet plane story already?
- I'm not on the jet story.
Norm, listen, I'm on to something I think can be real big.
-Uh-huh.
Where?
Oh.
Brother...
Huh?
What do you mean we can't print it?
- I've given my word to hold off for a while.
Now, listen, Norm.
A plane flew over Ludlow last night about midnight.
Just about the time the lid blew out.
Check on it. And... check Washington.
See if they had an atomic installation
 in the Ludlow area.
-Okay.
- Call me back as soon as you have anything, alright?
Goodbye.
- Sorry, miss, you can't... oh, it's you again.
-I know I can't.
But I'd like to have my camera back, please.
Col. Sturgeon said he was going to speak to somebody.
-Hey Corporal!
Mathias!
She wants her camera back.
-Hello, Norm?
What's the score?
-Wrong track, baby.
The airlines confirmed a commercial liner over Ludlow at
And there are no atomic installations, secret or otherwise, within 75 miles of Ludlow.
-Well, it was a possibility.
- The only people who've been playing around with the radioactive materials in your vicinity is the U.S.
Department of Agriculture.
-Department of Agriculture?
- Yeah, they've got an experimental project just outside Paxton.
- U.S. Department of Agriculture,
Illinois Experimental Station.
OK, I've got that.
I'll... I'll keep in touch.
U.S. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE
ILLINOIS EXPERIMENTAL STATION
Excuse me.
I beg your pardon.
I beg your pardon!
Oh!
- Hello.
- Oh, hello.
I... I spoke to him, but I guess he didn't hear me.
-Oh, he's a deaf mute.
Working with radiation can be dangerous.
An accident last year caused him his speech and his hearing.
-Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm looking for the project director.
- I am the project director.
My name is Ed Wainwright.
What can I do for you?
Oh, excuse me a minute.
-I'm sorry, Frank.
Nothing to worry about.
Just a slight catastrophe.
- Do you have these catastrophes very often?
-All the time.
It's hard to keep these little things from getting in.
These are snails.
Last summer it was caterpillars.
And after that it was grasshoppers by the droves, and, just last week it was beetles.
Now, what can I do for ya?
- Oh, Mr. Wainwright,
I'm Audrey Aimes,
I'm with the National
Wire Service.
I suppose you heard what happened at Ludlow.
-Yes.
- I'm trying to find out what was responsible, and it occurred to me that radiation of some sort might have caused the destruction out there.
-No, I don't think so. Here.
We're the only people around here using radioactive materials.
An isotope is nonexplosive.
So, I'm afraid your answer isn't here.
-Oh, I see.
Now, tell me, is this thing really a strawberry?
-Yes.
And these are tomatoes.
This, we hope, is the future of the American farmer.
And, for that matter, all farmers everywhere.
- Can you eat them?
- No, not yet.
But we hope to develop one day a hybrid that can be eaten.
- How is it there hasn't been any publicity on this?
- Oh, there have been a few stories in farm journals, but to the laws, to the public, these giants are just freaks of nature.
No practical value.
-Well, how do they get so big?
- Well, radiation causes photosynthesis, that is the... the growing process to continue night and day,
Radio isotopes act as a... sort of artificial sun, a sun that never sets.
- That's fascinating. But, tell me, what's he doing?
- Well, that's plant food.
Essential minerals.
Keeps the plants from burning themselves out.
They have to be fed constantly.
Actually, the fruit would grow much larger if we didn't limit the stimulation.
Maybe you'd like to do a story on us.
I'd be glad to tell you more about the work.
- Thank you very much. I'd be very interested, but, well, right now I'm working on this Ludlow story.
Thanks again.
- Right.
Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
Colonel!
- You here?
- Well, he wouldn't let me inside, so...
-Colonel!
Springfield is on the line.
-Colonel, you just got back from Ludlow.
You said after you got back, I could go.
- I said maybe.
Well, how about it?
Tomorrow it will be open to the press.
- Oh, Colonel, be fair.
I've played ball with you.
You'll give me the jump on the other reporters that will be in here.
At the least let me take some pictures at Ludlow.
I promise I won't put on the wire until tomorrow.
-Well, I guess you rate that.
For effort, anyway.
Capitain, take Miss Aimes to Ludlow.
And I hope you have a strong stomach.
- We're gonna take some pictures in Ludlow.
If... uh... we're not back in fifteen minutes, better come in after us.
-Yes, sir. Let 'em through.
-I've got enough.
Some people use calendars to tell age.
I could use ruins to count mine.
I was twenty-five when I went through soul left after Brussels.
I was 20 when I took my camera into
Cologne and Berlin after World War II.
-Must be used to it by now.
- Captain, there are some things you never get used to.
- How about a drink to wipe away some memories?
Good way to get rid of the jitters.
I know a little place...
- How do 150 people vanish into thin air?
- Well, around this part of the country things seem to have a way of vanishing.
Only a couple of months ago it was a warehouse.
Kind of fell apart overnight, just like Ludlow.
-Hello, Frank.
- Hi! Did you decide to come back and do a story on us?
- Oh, no. As a matter of fact,
I came back for some help.
I'd like you to do me a favor.
-Anything I can.
- Remember the warehouse that was destroyed about three months ago?
- Uh-huh.
- I want you to take me to see it.
-Oh, I, uh...
I'd like to, but I've got too much work on my hands right now.
How about tomorrow?
- Three months ago a warehouse was destroyed.
And the one person it vanished.
This morning, Ludlow was destroyed.
All the people in it vanished.
Don't you see a possible tie-up?
- It's possible, I suppose.
What do you want me to do?
- Just ride out there with me and take a look at it.
- I don't understand how good it will do.
The authorities investigated it thoroughly.
- The sheriff thinks in terms of crime and publicity.
You're a scientist.
You think in terms of cause and effect.
Maybe you will see something that the sheriff missed.
-That shouldn't be too difficult.
Still, I... I don't know.
-What's he saying?
- He says that... that your lips are easy to read, that your theory makes you a very bright girl in his book and that he'd like to go along with us.
-Good.
- When you barge into peoples' lives and drag them off to places they don't really want to go, aren't you... sort of in danger of becoming unpopular?
-That's an occupational hazard.
-How do you pick such an occupation?
-I think it sort of picked me.
I guess I was just born inquisitive.
Ever since I can remember I've wanted to know the why and where for just about everything I saw.
I inherited my knack with the camera from dad.
My curiosity supplied the nose for news and the camera supplied the memory.
So there you have it.
What about you?
Have you always been interested in science?
- Oh, I guess I have always been, one way or another.
I used to fool around with radios and anything electrical when I was a kid.
I was a radar officer during the war and then I got into this when I got out.
Ah, yes, I remember now, that every time I read one of your articles
it was dateline from some are of flood or famine or war...
Made me realize what a sheltered life we scientists really lead.
-Sheltered?
Look what happened to Frank.
- Looks to me as some force had to push these walls out from the inside.
-You think it was an explosion?
-No. it couldn't have been.
Any explosion big enough to destroy this warehouse
would certainly be heard at Ludlow.
-What was it they kept stored here?
-Wheat. Almost a million bushels.
-That's a lot of wheat.
- It was a surplus to keep the market from being oversupplied.
- Does it strike you as a little strange that out of all that wheat there's not a grain left anywhere?
- No, that's nature's way, Audrey. Birds probably cleaned up the leavings.
I see what you mean, Frank.
- What is it, Ed?
-You see how barren this ground is?
- I don't know. I've seen horses leave it like this.
- No, this is deeper than the horses go and much more thorough.
Pratically down to the roots. The horses pick and choose, they leave patches.
- Hmm...
- But this is completely barren.
Well, leave it to Old Frank. He'll make a botanist out of me yet.
- You're head of a government lab and you need lessons in botany?
- Well, I try to teach him what
I can about my field of study and he tries to teach me what he can about his.
- Aren't you a botanist?
- No, no, I'm an entomologist.
The study of insects.
- Well, then how come you're working with plants?
- Well, the... the existence and development of plants and insects are very closely related.
They're highly dependent on one another.
As a plain matter of fact one couldn't live without the other.
And that's what I can't understand.
Ground like this is usually teeming with insects.
This area is completely devoid of it.
- I think I'd like to get some shots of this.
I'm going back to the car for my camera.
-Alright.
Here, let me help you.
-What was that?
-I don't know.
-Oh, my god!
No, Frank's gone. You can't save him.
-Get in the car!
- The Geiger counter showed no radioactivity to speak of, sir.
Only background. There's got to be an explanation somewhere.
- I got your explanation for you, Tom.
- Ed!
-Now, listen.
You've known me ever since I came to Paxton. You know I'm not given to hysteria, and you've got to listen to me with an open mind.
- Take it easy, Ed.
- Locusts.
- What are you talking about?
- I'm talking about giant locusts.
Giant locusts are responsible for all of this.
Are you nuts?
No evidence of any explosion, Colonel.
Gullies look more like they're reeled with a battering ram.
We found these guns at the scene.
The kind people keep in their homes.
They've been fired.
-Okay. Lieutenant!
- Now, listen, Tom. These are eight feet tall, some are even bigger.
They're vicious, merciless killers.
- Now, Ed...
Lieutenant!
Lieutenant, phone Springfield again.
Tell him I'm still waiting for those specialists.
- Yes, sir.
- Frank Johnson is dead.
He was killed not half an hour ago.
- It was horrible.
- Obviously you are both under a strain...
- Won't you listen?
You've got to get more soldiers out there before more people are killed.
-Miss Aimes!
The governor asked me to exercise discretion when dealing with you.
Please don't make it any harder for me than it is.
-You have to believe us!
Listen, you've seen the giant plants out at the lab.
- Are you trying to tell me you breed these things?
-In a sense I did, yes.
Some locust must have gotten into the lab and they ate some of the plants or some of the radioactive plant food.
Well, their cell division accelerated immediately.
That is, they started to grow abnormally fast.
Well, they had to have a constant food supply to sustain this growth.
So, a couple of months ago, they wandered into the grain elevator outside of town.
When they grew to this giant size, they pushed their way out.
- Or we'll just push the building down.
- Yes!
Each one of them has the strength of ten men.
There are probably two or three hundred of them.
- So, last night not satisfied of eating grain, they came to Ludlow?
-Yes.
Even if I went for your story about the size, it would be hard to believe that it attacked people.
Sargent!
That report come in from the chemists?
- No, not yet, sir.
- Why won't you listen?
- I am listening.
- We saw Frank Johnson
Killed by a giant locust.
- Sure, and there have been reliable people who've also seen flying saucers and weird little men from Mars.
- I'll take another look at that town out there.
Or have you found the answer?
- Lieutenant?
- Yes sir?
- I'm taking the detail out for a look around.
You're to keep radio contact.
I want ten men.
Get 'em on the truck.
- Yes, sir.
-Alright, Ed, you can show me the exact spot where you saw... well, whatever it was you saw.
- No...
- Well, after all, let's see this grasshopper.
- Alright.
- Alright, grasshopper, he is allright.
- Man, we're gonna dig up some crazy grasshoppers.
- Why didn't they give us nets instead of rifles?
- Alright, I can't do much without them.
-Alright, men, clear out!
-Here's the spot, Tom.
-Where's the body?
-There isn't any body.
Just like Ludlow.
-Alright, men, into the woods.
Hey, Frank!
Maybe we could train one of these giant locusts to pull a plow, huh?
Struck?
- Yeah?
- I don't like this thing.
- Ah, take it easy.
- You know, grasshoppers are good eating,
-Yeah, Mustard and ketchup.
No, no kidding. I had once on Mexico.
- Well, you better watch your step.
The lava will get even.
They must have seen something.
Mr Wainwright assing it.
Stay up to see things right.
- Well, these days they blame atom for everything.
Bad health, bad crops, bad weather...
Now it's grasshoppers.
- They couldn't have just dreamed up this guy Frank being knocked off.
-Ah!
-Oh!
-Oh, my God!
-Get back in the truck!
-And every available man.
Also get some air support. We'll pummel out of that forest!
- What are you gonna do?
- Go in there and wive out every last one.
- They'll slaughter you.
- Not this time.
I want light artillery brought up with company eight.
-You don't have enough men.
- There will be three regiments out there tomorrow by 0300.
- You don't understand; you still don't have enough men.
- Not enough men for a couple hundred locusts?
- There are more than a couple hundred.
- But you said before...
- That was before I heard them screech.
The noise they made convinces me there are more.
-How many are there?
- I don't know. There could be countless numbers.
I think you better call in a regular army, Tom.
- What would I get off for a regular army to handle some oversized grasshoppers?
Why, they'd sectionate me right out of the service.
- Lieutenant, take charge of the east sector.
- Yes sir.
- You're making a mistake, Tom.
I'm afraid he doesn't understand how serious this is.
- After all, he knows what the military is capable of.
- Well, that's just it.
He has faith in regimental fire power because he's seen it work.
But he's never come up against an enemy like this before.
-Now, you've done all you can.
-No, no I haven't.
In a way I feel responsible, Audrey.
The country is in deadly danger if these locusts break out in the forest.
-What are you gonna do?
- I'm going to Washington. Maybe the army people will listen to me.
- I'll go with you. Maybe I can help.
I saw them, too.
-Alright.
I've got to convince them, Audrey.
We may be witnessing the beginning of an era that will mean the complete annihilation of man.
-Annihilation?
-Annihilation.
The beginning of the end.
-This, gentlemen, is the enemy.
This locust, more commonly known as the grasshopper, is almost identical to the giant locust of Ludlow except for its size and the fact that the giant's wings failed to develop. They cannot fly.
The Locust is intelligent.
It's strong.
Locusts follow a leader.
Like the bee and the ant they are able to communicate with each other.
This communication or call is produced by the hind legs.
This is the 1956
Australian locust plague.
Covered an area of 400 square miles.
We've been plagued by locusts since biblical times.
We've tried various forms of combating them.
As a matter of fact, in our own country, the early settlers of the
Massachusetts Bay Colony armed themselves with bundles of brush and drove millions of locusts into the sea.
Now, today, despite the fact that we've developed powerful insecticides, the locust still inflicts damages to the tune of $25,000,000 in the
United States alone.
California...
Colorado, Texas.
Even this small locust will attack a man.
It has two powerful jaws with a very sharp teeth,
It will kill other insects and devour them.
If no other insects are available, it becomes a cannibal.
Turning on its own kind.
Now, you've seen what a locust can do in its normal size, smaller than your thumb.
Imagine if you will, a locust that's grown bigger than a man, and is continuing to grow. x de 1956 than others, but each one a deadly killer.
I hope you realize we haven't much time.
- You are a scientist, Mr. Wainwright.
You know what locusts can do.
I'm a soldier. I know what guns can do.
I feel secure the Illinois National
Guard can handle this situation.
Did you want to say something, General Hanson?
-No, sir.
- I was greatly impressed with your presentation, Wainwright.
I'm sure all of us were.
Thank you very much for coming.
- I'm afraid my presentation didn't impress you quite enough, General.
-I don't understand you.
- I mean that when the locusts start to move out of that forest, I'm not sure that you'll be able to stop them.
- What are you suggesting we do,
Mr. Wainwright?
- Get them with everything you've got. Now!
You need more men, a lot more men.
You need tanks and heavy artillery...
- As of now, the full strength of the Illinois National Guard is in alarm, surrounding the
Ludlow Illinois Forests.
As I said before, Mr. Wainwright, you are a scientist.
Why not leave the fighting to the military?
-Urgent call from Paxton, Illinois, sir.
-General Short here.
Yes.
Yes, I see.
Thank you.
Matt will fly to Paxton with Mr. Wainwright.
He'll take charge of operations.
Mr. Wainwright?
I owe you an apology.
The locusts have broken through our defense lines.
Thousands of pastures.
Our troops are reorganizing to prevent
Paxton itself from being overrun.
- The hill position in the suburbs of Paxton must be held.
Otherwise, the 100 miles between
Paxton and Chicago will lie open.
-General? We can't land in Paxton, sir.
-Why not?
-It just came over the radio, sir.
Giant locusts have overrun Paxton at 1400.
- Head for Chicago.
- Yes, sir.
- Captain, I want these positions held and I want them all held at all costs if humanly possible.
- Captain, have your map people immediately turn out two overlays.
Showing the Chicago defense lines as tendered reset.
Yes?
General Hanson, Army H.Q. Chicago Ill.
GIANT LOCUST MOVING NORTH.
ILLINOIS TOWNS OF PEORIA,
PONTIAC, AND JULIET DESTROYED.
DEFEND CHICAGO AT ALL COSTS.
GEN. JOHN T. SHORT, CHIEF OF STAFF,
U.S. ARMED FORCES, WASHINGTON D..C.
Major Everett
- What about squadron 12?
- They haven't reported yet, General.
- Well, then let me know once you hear.
- Yes, sir.
I'll be with you in a moment.
Hale.
You'll proceed at once to temporary GHQ of central sector and assume command.
Norm.
You will order the 81st army division to proceed without delay to Chicago. Have the CG report to me upon arrival.
Request the Defense Department to alert the following divisions, Dave.
First armory, Deportia.
The first airborne.
The 92nd, and the 76th.
Now, what's your problem?
- Food. At the rate refugees are pouring into Chicago, General, our emergency stocks won't last long.
- Thyroxine is one we haven't tried.
- How good is it?
- Almost as powerful as Chlorine.
- Alright. Ship 2,000 gallons out to the base.
-Excuse me.
Hello?
He's speaking.
-Squadron 12 just reported.
They say they came down in a day.
And pratically drowned the enemy in insecticide.
The Chlordane didn't even slow them down.
You'll have to come up with something stronger.
-I'll do my best, General.
Goodbye.
The stuff's no good. Forget it.
-Looks pretty bad, doesn't it?
-I thought you went back to New York.
-Well, the big story's here.
- Look, your editor called you back because it was too dangerous.
-I wanted to be here.
-Nothing we've done so far, insecticides, fire bombs, nothing has done any good, in so little time.
-Well, you're doing everything you can.
- Well, everybody is, but it's not good enough.
The time will come when the beasts will inherit the earth.
- No, there's no sign of the locust yet, General.
Out.
- and with a lark of five divisions to the west and south of Chicago.
General Hansen is confident that he can keep the menace at bay.
Units of the air force and marines are moving into position
to back up those forces already deployed by the army.
But the one advantage our forces hold over the enemy
is that they always reveal their intention to attack.
Before every attack, the locust sent forth this
warning in the form of a high pitched screech.
Now, this screech increases in intensity
until it reaches ear-shattering proportions.
And it's when this screech reaches its full intensity
that the locusts attack.
- You got every available men in line, major, and
I think there's no question at what it will do.
-Hold your fire, men!
Fire!
- They keep coming, General!
 They seem to be gathering in a formation.
They're hammering in a single point in our line.
They keep coming, general.
Inch by inch they're moving closer.
Still they come, wave after wave.
They're going through a breech in their line.
Turn around.
Repeat, turn around.
- We interrupt this program for an important announcement.
The giant locust have reached the
Chicago south side and nearby suburbs.
I repeat, the giant locust have reached the
Chicago south side and nearby suburbs.
Keep calm.
Take shelter in the basement.
Take shelter in the basement.
Do not panic!
Attention, please.
Attention, please.
Keep moving. Do not block the highway.
Push stowed cars off the road at once.
Keep all traffic moving.
Do not panic.
Do not panic.
- General.
- Ed, Miss Aimes, grab a chair and sit down.
I sent for you because of a new development that may be favorable to us.
The locusts have stopped their advance.
They're huddled in the alleys and buildings just outside the loop.
-The locust got cold.
When the temperature drops below
68 degrees, they just stop moving.
- Well, maybe now is the time we can move in and destroy them.
-Well, they aren't in hibernation, sir.
They'll move if they're provoked and they're as deadly as ever.
When the sun comes out tomorrow, they'll be active again.
-The air force is standing by with a B-52 loaded with an atom bomb.
- You can't drop an atom bomb on Chicago!
- Washington has given me authority to do just that.
As a last contingency.
If the bomb is dropped early tomorrow, there'll be no loss of life.
The city will be evacuated by then.
-But what about the property?
We'll get billion dollars of damage in a site that's too contaminated to build on.
-I realize that.
But if we don't drop the bomb,
Chicago will most certainly fall.
The bomber crew is alerted.
We'll drop at dawn.
If we don't come up with something by then,
I'll make a final check with Washington and relay their okay.
Isn't there a chance the... locust could die in the night?
Of the cold?
- No.
Not at this time of year.
It takes 24 hours of exposure at 14 degrees.
-Isn't there some way you could... drive them into the lake?
In Washington you said the settlers did that.
-Settlers?
-Hmm?
Oh. Oh, the early settlers in Massachusetts, they did literally drive them into the sea.
But they weren't dealing with giants.
Wait a minute.
We can't drive them.
Not drive.
We could attract them.
Attract.
If we could reproduce their call, General, it just might work.
It just might work.
-A call for insects?
-Have you ever been duck hunting, General?
- The duck call?
- Yes.
There's one for bees, too.
They use it in apiaries.
It might work.
-What do you need?
Well, let me see.
I need a... I need a oscil oscillator,
I need an audio tube, two audio amplifiers, the most powerful you can get. I need an oscilloscope,
I need some high frequency radio equipment.
And a boat.
A fast boat.
-Whatever you need, we'll get.
- Well, there's one thing
I have to get myself.
Something that will tell me when I've succeeded.
-What's that?
-A live, giant grasshopper.
- Now, they gotta be around here somewhere.
Alright, men, off the truck.
- Major, I'd suggest you send some of them that way and some down there and you and I try the alley.
-O.K. You four men go that way, you men that way.
-Let's go.
- Come on, men. We found one in here!
Come on!
It's lucky we got one of the smaller grasshoppers.
Not too close, major.
We put that cage up in a hurry,
We don't know how strong it is.
A month ago I was teaching my engineering class at the university.
It was safe and secure.
Look at me now.
You know, I'm 37 years old.
And all of a sudden I realized for the first time how much I've taken life for granted.
I guess that's something you can't take for granted, Major.
- Ed, how will you know when you've got the right sound?
- He will tell us.
- How?
- He'll react to it. And this polygraph will record his reactions.
-How long will it take?
-It's a matter of trial and error.
It could take ten minutes or ten hours.
-We don't have ten hours.
We're dropping that bob at dawn.
-How does this work?
- Attach these wires to the polygraph to the two copper strips at the base of the cage.
Now, the locust, like the other living thing has galvanic reflexes or electrical charges in direct ratio to its activity or emotional stimulation.
-I don't understand.
- Well, in other words, when we hit the correct sound or signal, the grasshopper will react to it and the polygraph will record the change.
Now, you notice how steady and regular the movement of the needle is now?
When we reproduce the grasshopper's call, the lines will become longer and highly irregular.
- It's like a lie detector test, isn't it?
- Uh-huh.
That is the first time a grasshopper ever got one.
Now, if you'll keep your eye on the needle for any unusual jumps or dips, we'll get to work.
- Wainwright, you've had your chance.
Now it's the air force's turn.
Operator.
Operator, this is a top priority call.
Get the general Wagner at the base.
-Look, general, the locusts outside will stay put until the temperature reaches 68 degrees.
That's about an hour and a half from now.
-Wagner.
Chicago has been evacuated.
Unless you receive instructions on the contrary by 0616, that is...
- That's 90 minutes from now.
You allow the B-52 crew to look at the bottom of the designated target.
Repeat the instructions back to me.
Correct.
There's no time to fool with that now.
Major, get detail of men to move that stuff.
And bring some extra grenades.
There's some in my staff car.
There's a new lab set up for you at my new HQ outside the city.
-I can't move now.
- Well, you can't stay here. Not with an atom bomb hanging over your head.
-I don't have any choice!
Look, up till now, we have been using a filtered signal and it hasn't worked.
But it's just possible that the hearing apparatus of the locust can detect harmonic frequencies above the human range.
Well, to test these frequencies,
I need every minute that's left.
If you'll just give me one man to replace Miss Aimes.
-I'm staying.
- Well, look, this is no time to be worrying about a big story.
-I'm not worried about a story.
- Will you please leave before it's too late?
-No.
- Major, you and a detail of two men will remain here with Mr. Wainwright.
I will station men at three observation posts.
One in the suburbs, one near the art institute, and one on top of the downtown hotel.
Also, a helicopter will spot from above.
There will be a getaway car parked downstairs at the main entrance.
I suggest you use it by... by 5:45 at the very latest.
If you are successful, contact me at once, so I can stop the bomb.
-Ed. Ed, look at this.
-I think you've got it!
-That's good, Audrey. We've got it!
-The cage is yielding.
Cover him up.
And get that thing out of here.
Emergency lab at Chicago to GHQ.
Emergency lab at Chicago GHQ.
Come in General, are you there?
Now, listen to me, Wainwright.
-We found it, General.
We've found the frequency.
- Good.
Now stand by.
I've got to stop that A-bomb.
I'll get right back to you.
Chicago GHQ to double B.
Chicago GHQ to double B.
Chicago GHQ to double B.
Over.
- This is double B.
Come in, Chicago GHQ.
Over.
- Hanson here.
Your mission is canceled.
Return to your base.
Repeat the the message.
Over.
-Mission canceled. Return to base. Over.
-Chicago GHQ to Emergency Lab.
-Right here.
-The show is yours, Wainwright.
- Alright. Get that equipment on the lake in a boat.
And I'll be your Pied Piper.
-I still don't understand.
Why didn't you put the oscillator in the boat in the first place to send out the call?
Why attract them here?
- Because we'd never get them all.
Here, look.
Here we are in Downtown
Chicago near the lake.
Now, the locusts have scattered all through the suburbs on the south side.
And we'll send out the call from here.
- Yes, but that's going to attract them to us, not into the water.
-Well, first of all, it's imperative that every last one of the locusts hear the call.
Now, in order to do that, we've got to get our amplifier speaker at the highest possible point to get the maximum range.
Now, we've got ours on the roof of this building, which is one of the tallest in Chicago.
Now, once we get them here...
-Well, I say then boat will take over.
-Exactly.
Once we have them at the heart of the loop near our location, they'll be within range of the amplifier on the boat.
I will then radio our oscillator signal out to the boat, and they in turn will rebroadcast it over their amplifier directing the locusts to them and... into the lake.
-We hope.
-We hope.
Now, will you check and see about the temperature?
-How can we be sure, sir?
-Hmm? What to you mean?
-How can you know that we'll get them all?
-Well, that's where our observation posts and the helicopter come in.
From air reports, we'll know the exact location of the locusts at all times.
And if it's working.
-It's 70 degrees out. they're probably starting to move.
-Emergency Lab to all
Observation Posts.
Emergency Lab to all
Observation Posts.
Report in. Over.
-Observation Post number Two to Emergency Lab. Over.
-What is your location? Over.
-I'm situated in a store across from the
Art Institute on Michigan Boulevard.
The street is empty.
Nothing in sight. Out.
-Observation Post number three to Emergency Lab.
I'm on the roof of the Drayton Hotel.
Don't see any grasshoppers in this area, but the south side is getting some action.
Out.
-Emergency Lab to Observation Post One.
Emergency Lab to Observation Post One.
You did not report in.
What's your location, Post One? Over.
-This is Observation Post number One.
I'm right in the middle of them.
I'm just south of 73rd and
South shore drive. Hot.
-Emergency Lab to Helicopter. Over.
-Helicopter to Emergency Lab.
The locusts are active in the south side of Chicago.
There's yet another in the downtown area. Out.
-Can you read me, Emergency Lab? Over.
-Yes, we can read you fine, General.
Are you all set? Over.
Oh, we're not quite ready, yet.
I think you'd better hold off a few more minutes.
Over.
-I think we'd better start now, General.
If they should change their direction and start moving away from Chicago, we may not get them all. Over.
-I don't like you starting until we're completely ready.
This boat has to draw them away from you at a split second's notice.
Over.
-I'd like to start, sir.
-Then go ahead.
-Sargent?
-Yes, sir?
Is that the wire that leads to the speaker on the roof?
-Yes, sir.
-Well, plug it into the amplifier, will you?
-Yes, sir!
-Post Number One to Emergency Lab. The locusts are leaving this section.
They're heading towards Chicago's Downtown.
-Helicopter to Emergency Lab.
The locust are moving on the downtown area.
-Observation Post Number
Three to Emergency Lab.
The locust are everywhere!
They're moving toward your location.
I repeat: The locusts are moving toward the Emergency Lab.
-They're everywhere!
-Emergency Lab to Boat,
Emergency Lab to Boat.
It's working, General, it's working.
-I heard the reports.
- Ah, Help! Help!
-Here they come!
They're coming down the street.
-Oh, they're climbing the building!
-Wainwright to boat, Wainwright to boat, come in, please, come in.
-Come in, Wainwright.
-How soon are you ready?
-We're ready as soon as we get clearance from observation posts.
Now, check them immediately.
Out.
Boat to helicopter.
-They're still going in, sir, but it will be a while before they all reach the downtown sector.
-Wainwright.
You'll have to hold out a bit longer.
All the locust haven't reached the downtown sector yet.
-Alright, we'll try.
-We can't hold out much longer!
-Boat to Observation Posts.
Report.
Go on.
-Post number One.
All clear, sir.
-Post number two. All clear, sir.
-Helicopter reporting.
All clear, sir.
-Whenever you're ready, general!
-Then let's have it.
-Okay, go ahead, Audrey.
-Throw the switch.
-Fire!
Helicopter to boat.
General, they're responding.
They're responding!
They're swarming toward the water.
They're climbing all over each other!
Going into the water!
-Head for shore.
THE END
NARRATOR: First in Alaska and then
Invading steadily southward, there
Were reports of a new species.
The giant killer shrew.
[THUNDER]
Sure is a lot of quiet out there.
Almost smell it, can't you?
No, I but I can feel it.
That pressure's dropped so fast it's almost made my ears pop.
Hurricanes got definite ways of telling you it's there.
Where is it?
Dead ahead.
What's that mean to us?
Now boy, that puts our port right in the middle of it.
There's a cove on the east side though.
We'll snuggle up close to the bluff and ride it out.
What about the bottom?
Well, the chart shows it's good holding ground.
It's clay.
You know something?
If this thing had an automatic pilot,
I wouldn't have to put up with you.
Then you wouldn't have nobody to chew out.
We should be there in a couple of hours.
These mills of yours keep running.
Look, automatic pilots can't play dixieland jazz
On their [INAUDIBLE] like I can.
Hey, Rook.
Rook, come here.
Take a look.
There she is, dead ahead.
Man, that sure do look good.
Man named Craigis owns this island, does he?
That's the name on the crate, Dr. Marlowe Craigis.
We'll unload tomorrow.
I don't want this crap sitting high in that water
When that blow hits.
You going to ride [INAUDIBLE] with a lot of water under?
That's right.
That sea won't make up in that cove.
That wind will have her whipping around like a kite.
Step forward and break out the heavy weather hook.
Check it and make sure it's free to run.
- I don't mind, sir.
- Good.
Ah, she'll ride like a duck.
If she swings too far to starboard
We might have to take a check line to shore.
Hey Rook, take a slant up that trail.
Now that's a rather strange set up, wouldn't you say?
Looks like somebody's getting rid of somebody, huh captain?
Maybe.
Hard to tell.
I'm Dr. Craigis.
Thorne Sherman.
I have your supplies aboard.
That's good.
Nothing wrong with Captain
[INAUDIBLE], I hope?
I wouldn't know.
I just bought his run.
Oh, I see.
Well, [INAUDIBLE] order?
Everything on the list.
Here's the manifest.
Missing last week's supply has run us a little short,
You know.
Captain, after you have unloaded,
I have a passenger for you.
Ann.
Captain Sherman, this is my daughter, Ann Craigis.
Hello.
So you're the passenger.
That's right, Captain.
Well, it's going to be nice having you aboard.
I'm getting a little tired of looking at Griswold.
But we're, uh, we're not leaving today.
In fact, we're not even unloading.
That load will cut the roll in half.
You expecting an invasion?
Yes, animals.
Game or otherwise?
Under certain conditions it could be dangerous.
Hey Rook, you want to shake the kinks out, limber up a little?
Not me, Captain.
You go right ahead and stretch your legs.
That ship's going to be bucking like a bucking bronco
Before long.
Besides, I got some work left to do.
If you do come ashore, wear a gun.
Got you, Captain.
When I told you about the hurricane,
You acted like you didn't know anything about it.
What's the matter?
Your set broken down?
We have been out of communication for more than a
Week, Captain.
Can't it be fixed?
It's totally out of commission.
My assistant, Mr.
Farrell, Jerry Farrell.
Father, perhaps the captain would enjoy a drink.
Well of course.
Will you join us for a cocktail?
Well, I've never been known to turn down a drink yet.
I'd be glad to accept.
Fine.
In that case we'll have martinis.
Mario.
Si, senor?
Mix them, please.
Right this way, Captain.
Come in.
You have everything here you need?
We are self sufficient here.
We have cows for fresh milk and chickens for fresh eggs.
We even have
[INAUDIBLE] horses.
Sort of a world all your own.
That's exactly what
I've tried to create.
Well, to each his own.
If you have to be isolated for your work,
You picked a lonely little island.
Excuse me, please,
I think I'll change.
She's a little worried because you
Aren't leaving until tomorrow.
Well, I can understand that.
But there's something else bothering her.
Radford.
Radford.
Radford, would you please step over here?
I'd like you to meet someone.
Just a second, Doctor.
That could go on for hours.
Dr. Baines.
There's no need to shout,
Doctor, I'm right here.
I'd like you to meet
Captain Thorne Sherman.
This is my other assistant, Radford Baines.
How do you do?
Two new litters since lunch, Doctor.
Both support GT116.
That's good, but, uh...
We can breed them to the 205 group in about three weeks.
But I'd prefer to wait and expose about half of them
To the Hoskins factor first.
If you agree.
Good idea.
Do you know there's a hurricane coming?
Hurricane?
Well, I don't suppose there's much we can do about that.
Glad to meet you.
Sherman, was it?
You have to excuse Radford.
Anything that does not concern his
Project cannot get through to him.
Brilliant mind.
He would starve to death if someone
Didn't remind him to eat.
Must be very interesting work.
What's his field?
Biology.
He specializes in genetics, heredity.
I'm afraid my interest doesn't run in that line, you know.
Think what would happen if you could isolate and identify
The inherited
[INAUDIBLE] in each gene.
Now wait a minute.
I'm afraid I'm not very good with pure research.
This is practical research.
[INAUDIBLE] mammals, the smaller the size, the higher
The metabolism and shorter the life span.
Yeah, right.
Well, I'm attempting to decrease the size
By maintaining a low metabolism and result
In a longer lifespan.
What reason?
Overpopulation.
Not a problem now, but it will be in time.
If we were half as big as we are now,
We could live twice as long in our natural resources.
Father, may I speak with you a moment?
Will you please excuse us, Captain?
Well, providing you drop the captain.
I prefer Thorne.
Tell me something, Doctor.
Has a hurricane ever hit this island before that you know of?
I wouldn't know.
We've only been here nine months and this place
Has been unoccupied for years.
Well have you ever been through one?
Only the fringes.
Well, this one's building up very fast.
Pressure drops very quickly in the center.
I'd advise you to get some doors and windows open in this place.
Ventillators in the roof.
And if you'll freshen Ann's drink I'll go and check them.
I'd be happy too.
Thank heavens you arrived today.
Why, are rations getting short?
No, it's more than that.
Much more.
We'll surely be able to sail tomorrow, won't we?
Possibly.
But not probable.
Not until late, anyway.
Takes a long time for a sea like that to quiet down.
Well if you're worrying about me, you needn't.
I'm a good sailor.
Oh, I'm not worried about you.
We'll sail when the time's right.
Got them opened all right.
Oh, Captain, let me freshen you a drink.
One for the road.
Not trying to rush you, but it will be dark soon.
I've invited Thorne for dinner, father.
Oh?
I see.
If you're not worried about your ship, you are welcome.
I'll take a rain check on that dinner.
If you wish.
Father.
I've asked Thorne to stay.
Progress, Doctor.
This is the sole survivor of group 30.
28 months old today.
Well that's equivalent to 140 years to us.
That's right.
Yet it still maintains low metabolism
Without any sluggishness.
It's not a breakthrough, but it certainly sets our course.
Radford, suspend series 52 through 96
And we'll concentrate on the rest.
What is that?
It's a sorex soricidae.
Looks like a small rat.
Smells like a skunk.
They have musk glands [INAUDIBLE].
These little fellas are our subjects.
They have a birth cycle of
10 to 14 days and using them
We can establish traits.
We can trace the progressions through a number
Of generations over a short period of time.
Well how big do they get?
That's an adult.
See, the muzzle is long and thicker than a rat's.
It extends over the lower mandible, see?
Does he bite?
Only when he is hungry.
Well, maybe you'd better take him.
He doesn't know me.
All he knows is his next meal.
He's just been fed.
He'll be all right for another eight hours.
[CRASHING]
[SCREAMS]
A shutter blew open.
Radford.
I got it, senor.
Don't let that scare you.
It's going to get worse.
Storms always frighten her, ever since she was a child.
They are not climbers.
They are digging animals, like the mole.
They feed only at night unless they are starving.
And when they are hungry enough, they'll
Tackle anything regardless of size.
No kidding.
If you leave two of them in a cage for 12 hours without food,
The stronger will eat the weaker.
Like cannibals.
Precisely.
You see, their intense activity requires
A tremendous amount of energy.
To supply, they must eat three times their own weight in food
Every 24 hours or starve.
Radford.
Radford, would you please take this?
Take him.
Some call them bone eaters.
When the flesh is gone, they'll eat the bones for marrow.
All they leave are teeth, horns, hooves...
I could use another martini.
Do you mind?
Of course, my dear.
I'll get you one.
There you are.
Mario?
Mario.
[SPEAKING SPANISH] Mario will show you to the bath
And you will freshen up a bit.
[SPEAKING SPANISH]
[SPEAKING SPANISH]
Excuse me.
[SPEAKING SPANISH]
You got a problem too?
Que paso?
[SPEAKING SPANISH] But you will leave on the ship tomorrow.
Well, I think that all depends on the wind and the sea,
Don't you?
Si.
Si senor.
I don't know.
Ah, [INAUDIBLE].
I feel the point.
I see.
Well, I'm glad to hear that.
Now if anybody else is concerned about my sailing
Tomorrow, why, you see they feel the point too, huh?
I don't like to repeat myself.
OK, senor.
I know, but I'm not saying that you created them, Jerry.
I am saying that because of your drunken stupidity
In leaving the cage door open, you
Created the horrible situation that now exists.
Look, Ann, this is a mistake any one of us might have made.
And I'm getting a little sick of being called
An irresponsible drunk, now believe me I am.
Excuse me.
Care for a cigarette?
Thanks.
And thank heavens you arrived today.
You said that before.
What's the strain?
If I don't make sense, please excuse me.
But it seems like everything is coming to a head at once.
Oh?
I want to leave, but I want my father to go with me.
Well then, why doesn't he?
We've discussed it many times, but he's adamant.
I'm sure Jerry has a lot to do with his decision.
He tried to convince me that the crisis
Will only last for a few...
Well.
This is certainly a cozy little scene.
Might even be called intimate.
Boy meets girl...
Stop it, Jerry.
That remark is uncalled for.
What I do or have to say does not concern you.
I can't disagree with you more, my dear.
I'm concerned with everything you do
And I intend to keep it that way.
Now on my book an engagement isn't a casual thing.
In my book it isn't either.
And last night ended ours.
[SHREWS CHATTERING]
[GUNSHOTS]
[THUNDER]
[THUNDER]
[SHREWS CHATTERING]
Help!
Help!
Captain Thorne!
Somebody help!
Help, Captain Thorne!
[THUNDER]
Be reasonable.
Everybody in the world is scared to death of something.
That's evident.
When they came at us last night you
Knocked me down getting inside the fence.
It's just that I can't stand them.
And I've discovered something I can't stand.
All right.
But I advise you not to mention it to anyone.
I'm going to complete these experiments with your father
Regardless of anything, do you understand that?
Nobody is going to take this chance away from me.
Where's Captain Sherman?
Checking the weather.
I'll get him.
Captain?
Time for dinner.
[SHREWS CHATTERING]
Help!
Somebody!
Help!
Help me!
No!
Somebody!
Help!
[GUNSHOTS]
Help!
Somebody help me!
Help me!
[SCREAMS]
[SCREAMING]
[THUNDER]
Well, a miss as good as a mile, I always say.
And if one of those trees crashes through
It might just knock the whole...
Look, any tree on this side of the house
Will fall away from us, so just relax.
But I think I'd better go back aboard.
Don't think I'm not grateful for your hospitality.
I am.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Thorne.
Your ship is safe.
Please, stay here with me.
Why?
You scared or lonesome?
Both.
I'll take a rain check on it.
Thorne.
You can't leave.
No one opens that gate after dark.
Well, who's going to stop me?
You?
With this.
No one opens that gate at night.
[SHREWS CHATTERING]
Look, I don't ask questions because it's
Against my principles.
But wouldn't you like to explain that?
All right.
Sit down and I will.
Give me the gun.
Not very becoming, anyway.
Do you believe in fairy tales?
Well, I'm a little old for that sort of thing,
But what did you have in mind?
Well I'll tell you about one.
A true fairy tale, and you're right in the middle of it.
Oh?
Have you ever heard of a shrew?
As in "Taming of the"...
No, the animal.
Radford called them sorex soricidae
When he showed you one.
Well, then shrew must be the common name
For those cute little animals.
Cute?
That's the last word you can use to describe
Those little monsters.
They're the most horrible animals
On the face of the earth.
As father told you, they breed within three weeks after birth.
Their lifespan is one year.
Yeah, I know what your father told me.
But what's that got to do with me opening that gate?
There are 200 or 300 giant shrews out there.
Monsters weighing between
50 and 100 pounds.
50 to 100... wait a minute.
You must be kidding.
I'm definitely not kidding.
That's as big as a full grown wolf.
And what's more, they are beginning to starve.
No wonder you didn't want me to go out there.
Thanks for saving my skin.
And I'm sorry I had to threaten you with a gun.
But I didn't know how else to stop you.
It was very effective.
But all you had to do was tell me about them.
I hoped I wouldn't have to.
But you changed everything when you started to leave.
And I had to stop you some way.
You say there's 200 or 300 out there?
Ann.
That's right, Captain Thorne.
And if you'd stuck with your row boat
And played captain instead of trying to play detective,
You wouldn't have to worry about how many are out there,
Would you?
That's enough, Jerry.
What's wrong, Ann?
Thorne decided to leave.
To dissuade him I started to tell him about the shrews.
He might as well know the whole story as half of it.
I guess we're all a little jumpy, captain.
I'm sorry.
Six months ago we managed to isolate
The path to controlling size.
Two litters were born.
Six individuals kept for study.
They were about the size of buckshot at birth.
But the rate of growth was abnormal.
They continued to grow and grow.
They were mutants.
But they inherited all the negative characteristics
Of their breed.
Somehow they managed to escape.
About a month later we saw one of their offspring.
They were multiplying.
We did everything in the world to exterminate them,
But no apparent luck.
Then we haven't seen any since daylight blinds them and they
Forage only at night unless starving.
But the fact that two of them charged Ann and Jerry
At the gate last evening indicates
That their available food on the island is nearing depletion.
Then what, Doctor?
They will exterminate each other.
It will take a couple days.
And what do we do during that time?
Stay indoors and wait until it's over.
I guess some wires blew down on the transformer.
I'm sorry.
I'll get some lamps.
Mario.
Mario.
Si, senor?
There's a lantern in the pantry.
Light it and bring it in here.
Radford, light all the candles you can find.
All right, I will.
Where's the generator?
Outside.
Can't get at it at night.
Here, let me help.
A lantern will give you all the light you need.
I will join you shortly, Jerry.
[THUNDER]
Well, Jerry, I felt she was sincere
And made sense from her standpoint.
Wanting her father to leave the island with her makes sense?
It'd be much better for the project
If I went with her for a few days.
As a matter of fact, I think
I'll talk to Doctor about that.
That might be the answer.
And another thing, I don't take much to this Thorne Sherman.
He looks to me like the type that would try anything.
That left handed dinner invitation.
That was just to keep me here until after dark, wasn't it?
I wanted you here tonight.
I thought something terrible was going to happen.
Do you still feel the same way about it?
Not as much.
Not since you're here and know everything.
[SHREWS CHATTERING]
[HORSE NEIGHING]
I love an open fire, don't you?
Mm-hmm.
The wind has a lonesome sound, doesn't it?
Sure does.
Back in Sweden we don't have a wind this strong.
You're a strange man, Thorne.
I never met anyone like you.
Oh?
You seem so disinterested in everything.
Aren't you the least bit curious?
Don't you wonder about the unusual things around here?
The guns, the fence, shattered windows, my accent, anything?
I'll tell you something.
I'm only interested in anything that concerns me,
Then I do something about it.
[HORSE NEIGHING]
You're going to sail with me tomorrow whether your father
[INAUDIBLE].
[HORSE NEIGHING]
Thorne, no!
Father!
Rad!
Out there.
I don't think he was going out, Jerry.
I couldn't take a chance.
He's fool enough to.
Don't be stupid.
I had no intentions of going out there and opening
That gate unless somebody needed it.
Did you hear it, Doctor?
Sounded like a human voice.
I was thinking of Rook.
It was the livestock.
The shrews got into the barn.
What was it, father?
The livestock.
Did Mario forget to bar those doors?
No.
I put them in the barn myself.
They couldn't get through the wood doors.
They dug through the dirt floor.
Let me ask you something, Doctor.
How could you expose all our lives, yourself included,
With those things out there?
All you had to do was get the Coast Guard or the Navy
To come in here and burn them out.
Those things got loose...
Any unusual experiment can produce unusual results.
That's why I chose this island.
It's isolated.
Miles of open water in any direction.
Our project is privately financed.
It's not a product for the government or military.
And the world is no danger.
This species does not swim.
And as far as the shrews are concerned,
This island is their world.
Very soon, right here on this island,
There's going to be a miniature reproduction
Of an overpopulated world.
And you'll see the importance of what we're working to avoid.
I'm not concerned about all this theory.
What I'm concerned about is our lives.
There'll be ample time to panic when they run out of food
And go on a 24 hour forage.
How do you know they haven't already?
That's possible.
Their main diet has been small animals on the island.
That source could have been depleted 18 or 20 hours ago.
And that's why they went after the livestock.
There's still some food on this island
Before they reach the crisis.
Where?
No worry about them digging in here.
The floors are tile.
But the walls aren't, Doctor.
They're adobe.
Our safest bet would be on that boat.
You may be right.
You can reach your boat in daylight.
The shrews will gorge themselves on livestock.
That will keep them lethargic for several hours.
There's no sense looking at the dark side.
And there's no sense minimizing a serious situation.
It leaves you completely unprepared to cope with it.
Now we certainly can't make it tonight.
That's out of the question.
Maybe tomorrow.
I have it.
We'll get some sleep tonight, but we'll
Have a watch, an hour and a half apiece.
Doctor, you go first, and then Radford, Mario, Jerry,
And then me.
Shutter all the windows.
Make sure they're locked good and tight.
Check all these walls.
Come now.
No, I think I'll stay here by the fire.
I feel safer.
I couldn't stand it in that room alone.
All right.
As you wish.
But try to get some sleep.
I will.
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]
Senor Farrell, it is Mario.
You are next to make the patrol, no?
(SLURRING) Sure,
Mario, come on in.
Been waiting for you to finish.
I must have dozed off.
You kind of startled me.
Sit down.
Here.
Have a drink.
It'll help you to relax.
Gracias, senor.
Sit down.
Rest a while.
You just checked every room in the house, didn't you?
Si.
Fine.
You're a good man, Mario.
A man that can be trusted.
You know what I've been thinking about, Mario?
Ann and that captain.
You and me.
Imagine an intelligent girl like her going
For a common sea tramp like him.
I know why.
You do too.
In case anything goes wrong she's
Looking out for her own hide.
That's why I keep thinking about you and me.
Anything goes wrong, we're going to outlast them all.
[THUNDER]
I'm going to trust you to take my turn
At patrolling the house.
But when you finish, don't wake the captain.
Come back here and get me.
I'll probably feel good enough by then to take his turn.
OK, Mario?
Si.
OK.
[SHREWS SQUEAKING]
Senor, it is Mario.
Mario.
Come on in.
What is it?
[SPEAKING SPANISH]
A shrew in the cellar?
Si.
I hear him [INAUDIBLE] down there.
Well how did he get in?
The [INAUDIBLE] the kitchen window.
But I close it off.
He went down there.
Why should he go down there?
The food for the [INAUDIBLE].
I [INAUDIBLE].
They love it.
Well did you tell Jerry?
No, senor.
He [INAUDIBLE] your turn next.
Here is [INAUDIBLE].
We kill him, no?
Yeah.
Ann.
Ann, wake up.
A shrew got in.
It's all right.
He's down in the cellar.
Now, we're going down after him.
But I don't want you to let anybody
Open that door until I tell you to.
You understand?
Good girl.
OK.
Open it just a crack.
Open it.
Hold on to it.
OK.
Take that side.
Mario?
[SPEAKING SPANISH]
You see anything?
I see where he was.
I do not see where he is.
[SPEAKING SPANISH]
Si, senor.
I will be careful.
[GUNSHOT]
[SPEAKING SPANISH]
Here, let me fix that.
[SHREW SQUEAKING]
[GUNSHOT]
You all right down there?
Doctor, get down here quick.
Mario!
He... he's dead.
Dead?
I got this on him right away.
He couldn't have bled to death.
Might as well let go of it.
Won't do him any good now.
What could have killed him?
I'm not certain.
Until the autopsy.
Hemotoxic syndrome.
I'm afraid so.
We'll know after pathology.
Doctor, that's not the same animal you showed me.
That's a monster.
As I said, they are mutants.
In controlling the size factor, we
Seem to have crossed some of the other characteristics.
Well, you certainly did a good job of it.
I've known that for some time, Captain.
Would you please give me a hand with Mario?
Radford, bring up the animal.
Extremely high poison content in the shrew's saliva.
Mm-hmm.
Now compare it with this.
Careful count isn't necessary.
Any indication the same poison in Mario's blood
Will give you the answer.
Yes, you're right.
Look, Ann.
Brooding about it's not going to do any good.
Now why don't you try to think of something else?
Tell me, what do you do around here?
Are you a scientist?
I'm a zoologist.
Oh?
That's the study of animal life, isn't it?
Well, do you specialize?
What do you specialize in?
[INAUDIBLE].
I had a hand in this too.
I'm partly to blame.
[SHREWS CHATTERING]
[INAUDIBLE].
If we ever get off this island, I'll
Never have anything to do with it again.
What will you do?
Live normally, like normal women do.
May seem a little dull after the life I've been living.
But I'd rather dull and alive than excited and...
I'd take a dull alive woman every time.
Say, Thorne.
The autopsy has proved what we suspected.
Several weeks ago I concocted the most virulent poison
I could with the materials I had at hand.
I put it out as bait.
Mario was killed by poison.
Doctor, I wonder if you thought the system of the sorex
Enabled them to assimilate that poison.
It remained in the salivary glands of their jaws.
Isn't that wonderful?
I am sorry.
Of course I always speak from the clinical point of view.
Well, don't you have something to counteract that poison?
Once Mario was bitten I'm afraid there's nothing anyone
Could have done.
This indicates that we cannot afford to get even so much
As a scratch from these animals.
They're more poisonous than snakes.
What, do you think they're all effected?
Best way to find out is let them all
Bite you and see which bites you die after.
We might just all get that chance, Jerry.
You included.
Doctor, I've closed all the doors in the house.
I suggest we do the same thing with this hall and this lab.
It'll cut down the chances of getting
In the front of the house.
I think if we keep a close watch on those walls and windows
In there, we might make it until daybreak.
The walls are two feet thick.
Do you think they have a chance to dig in?
Of course there's a chance.
Anywhere that plaster's off, that adobe's as soft as mush
Where that rain hit it.
[SHREW SQUEAKING]
It's not a bad idea, Doctor.
But here's another possibility, Doctor.
It's very light out.
It's going to be daylight soon.
We take the shrew that killed Mario
And throw it over the fence and use it for bait.
If they show up for it, of course the run for the boat's
Out.
But if they don't, then I'll go down
And have Rook lay too with the lighter.
Then I'll return to the bend in the trail
And give you the all clear signal.
Sounds fine, Captain.
Good, then you explain it to the rest.
Yes, I will.
Well, the bait's been out there 20 minutes.
Nothing's touched it.
Even the wind has gone down.
Isn't that wonderful?
I'm afraid it's not over, my dear.
It's just a lull.
There'll be a lot more.
He's right.
I'll be back at the bend shortly.
Now you watch for my signal.
You can't go alone.
I'll go with him.
Not you, father.
You haven't even fired a gun.
Take Rad or Jerry.
Sure, I'll go.
And you'll be sure of getting a signal.
Don't shoot that gun unless you have to.
We've only got 20 rounds all together.
I know that as well as you do.
Sherman.
You stay away from her.
Do you have that gun pointed at me?
Right at the middle of your back.
Look, we got enough problems without worrying about Ann.
I'm telling you, stay away from her
Or when the shrews get through with you,
They won't even find a buckshot.
[SHREWS CHATTERING]
Hey, Rook!
Hey, Rook!
Rook!
[WHISTLES] Where's the skiff?
I'll follow that check line.
I've got to find him.
Since last night you won't find much of him.
Would you shut up?
I'm not going back.
You what?
I'm staying here.
All right.
You suit yourself.
But if I were you, I'd swim out to that boat.
Can't swim.
Then stay here.
Wait a minute.
You've got to give me a gun.
Give you a gun?
Sherman, wait!
This is the gun we had on the boat.
They don't leave much, do they?
Sherman, we've got to make a deal for...
[SHREWS SQUEAKING]
What is it?
Shh.
They've been trailing us on both sides.
Where?
I didn't see anything.
Look, Sherman, you've got to give me a gun.
All right.
Whatever you do, don't you run.
And you stay in front of me because I don't trust you.
[SHREWS CHATTERING]
They're coming!
Open the gate!
Open it!
[GUNSHOT]
Open the gate!
Open the gate!
Open up!
Let him in!
Jerry, open the door!
[GUNSHOT]
[INAUDIBLE].
Sherman!
The shrews were out there!
I couldn't take a chance!
[MEN YELLING]
For heaven's sakes.
Doctor, stop him!
All right, didn't he have it coming or didn't he?
What happened out there?
Oh, nothing much.
Jerry just tried to kill me twice in the last five minutes.
Rook came ashore last night.
He's dead.
This is all that was left.
Won't do us any good.
It's got no ammo.
I'm deeply sorry, Captain.
I wish he had followed your orders.
Look, Doctor, you casually mentioned animals.
You didn't explain to us what we were facing out there.
You have every right to feel the way that you do.
My mistake was only mine.
It was one of judgment.
I didn't know about the hurricane.
I didn't anticipate the effect it would have on the shrews.
I thought the house would be safe through the crisis.
How could you expose your own daughter?
How could you expose Ann to that?
She was going to leave last week, but the boat didn't come.
I need a drink.
Anybody else care for one?
I could use some coffee.
I'll make some.
Thank you, Ann.
Cream and sugar?
[SHREW CHATTERING]
Oh, my leg!
[GUNSHOTS]
Slam the door!
You all right, Doctor?
He just ripped my trousers, that's all.
Are you sure that's all?
I'm completely aware of it, Doctor.
I'll kill them!
[GUNSHOTS]
That was a stupid waste of ammunition.
Every one of them a clean miss.
There's still four of them in there.
How did they get in?
Through that kitchen window.
That rope must be rotten.
It's got him!
Radford!
He's dead.
Oh, no!
He recorded every symptom and reaction.
Right up to the moment of his death.
Jerry, tear down one of those drapes and cover him up.
Sure.
Sure.
Craigis will cover Ann and I'll cover him.
You'll cover me.
But who'll cover you?
Shut up.
We can get on [INAUDIBLE].
I told you to shut up.
Now you stop snivelling and think.
It'd take a tank to get us out of here.
Thorne!
There!
[SHREW SQUEAKING]
Won't take them long to dig around this.
You're right.
No telling where else they're digging too.
[GUNSHOTS]
Come on. [INAUDIBLE].
There's not enough stuff here to barricade those walls.
I'll tell you what, pile some of those crates up over there.
That roof's our last chance.
Help me, Doctor.
Find something light.
All right.
Here, [INAUDIBLE] Doctor.
Jerry, see if you can find some rope.
Doctor.
Yes?
Use these chemical drums as tanks.
Individual tanks.
Here, I'll show you.
Set it down now.
Slow.
All right.
All right?
Yeah.
It'll work.
It'll work.
But these drums are too tall for the base.
If the shrews don't push us over, the wind will.
Not if we lash them together.
Are there any more around here?
Only that one over there.
Have any [INAUDIBLE] chisels or hammers or anything
I could knock a hole in here and make [INAUDIBLE] pieces?
There are some tools over there in the corner.
Hey, here's another one.
Get that out there.
Hey, even better.
Give me a little more slack.
Get some rope and put it on that latch so we can [INAUDIBLE]
From the ground.
[SCREAMS]
[SHREW SHRIEKING]
Now hold this in.
All right.
All right.
We're all set.
Look, it's going to be rough, but we
Should be able to duck walk to the beach.
Where's Jerry?
There's a lot of them out there.
I can see them.
I'm not going.
Look, come down here!
That wind will blow you right off that roof.
I told you, I'm not going.
I'm staying here.
We've got to get him down here somehow.
Ann, see if you can coax him down here.
Jerry, Jerry please come down with us!
No.
Ann, they'll get you if you go out there.
Come down here, you fool!
Poor devil.
I hope he makes it.
We can't leave.
He's not responsible for himself.
We have to go now.
All right, Doctor.
Now hold it up.
Everybody ready?
I'm going to open that gate.
Ready.
Ready.
OK, here they come.
Hold on.
Hold on.
[SCREAMS]
Ann, what's the matter?
Your side's dragging.
You want to rest?
You tired?
[SPEAKING SWEDISH]
What'd you say?
She says she's all right.
She's keeping her eyes closed.
All right.
Keep your eyes closed.
They can't get at you through the slit.
This empty drum is too heavy for her.
I can barely hold up my side.
I'll be all right in a minute.
All right.
You walk.
I'll drag for a while.
Listen.
Don't let their head get under.
They'll flip us over.
[GUNSHOTS]
[SCREAMING]
[SCREAMS]
He got my foot!
Check your foot!
No, my foot is free but he got my boot.
Is there a scratch?
No.
Not a mark.
[GUNSHOT]
Keep moving.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Thorne, I don't think I...
What?
Sand!
We're at sand!
Sand, we're close!
We'll hit the water soon.
Doesn't sound like they're following us anymore.
We'd better walk deeper.
I'm about drowned out.
OK, let's swim for it.
OK.
[SPEAKING SWEDISH] We are safe, aren't we?
I mean, the storm.
Oh, sure.
She rode out the first half all right,
And that's always the roughest.
Anyway, riding an anchor out will give me a chance
To learn a little bit more about that Swedish accent.
In 24 hours, there'll be one shrew left on the island.
And he'll be dead of starvation.
An excellent example of overpopulation.
Well, you know something, Doctor?
What's that?
I'm not going to worry about overpopulation just yet.

The heavens,
once an object of superstition, awe, and fear,
now a vast region for growing knowledge.
The distance of Venus, the atmosphere of Mars,
the size of Jupiter and the speed of Mercury,
all this and more we know.
But their greatest mystery, the heavens have kept a secret.
What sort of life, if any, inhabits these other planets?
Human life like ours?
Or life extremely lower in the scale,
or dangerously higher?
Seeking the answer this timeless question,
forever seeking,
is the constant preoccupation of scientists everywhere.
Scientists famous and unknown,
scientists in great universities,
and in modest homes.
Scientists of ALL ages.
What are you doing, Darling?
It's all right, Mary,
I'll... I'll put the coffee on.
It's four o'clock in the morning.
Four o'clock?
The alarm went off.
You've been dreaming.
The alarm's set for seven thirty, as usual.
That boy!
David!
Gee, Dad,
I didn't mean to wake ya up.
Do you know what time it is?
I know, but Orion's in its zenith and it won't happen again for six years.
Move over!
Isn't that something?
Boy, that is sure clear.
Ya know I spot Rigel and Bellatrix, but to be able to spot the Great Nebula and...
Both of you can hike right back to bed.
- I was just telling him...
- So I saw.
It's not enough that I'm married to a scientist, but my son has to turn into one, too.
Come on, David, back to the feathers.
Gee, Mom, can't we stay up a few minutes longer?
I should say not!
At this hour in the morning!
- But...
- Now, your mother is right.
Now, not another peep out of you until you hear her in the kitchen.
You'll hear your father this morning, if this old lady gets awakened early she sleeps late.
- Good night, David.
- Good night, Mom.
Good night, Dad.
- You go to sleep now?
- I will.
Good night, Son.
Gee whiz!
- Dad! Dad!
- What is it, Son?
Something landed out beyond the trees, in the sand pits.
- A big, bright light!
- What?
Come on, it's out there now,
I'll show ya.
Didn't mother ask you to stay in bed?
I did, I was asleep, it woke me up.
There's a bright light that lit up everything, and...
Dad, it landed right out there!
You were dreaming!
If a meteor fell it would've wakened people up for miles around.
But it didn't fall, it landed!
I saw it!
I don't know what it was, Dad, a spaceship or something.
How big was it?
- As big as...
- An airplane?
Bigger!
Well, there's nothing out there now, is there?
- Not now, but there was, I saw...
- Climb in bed, Son.
Now, look, Son, you know this is all your imagination, don't ya?
- But I saw it!
- Well, what did it look like?
Well, I can't say exactly.
First there's this light, then it faded, then there's a humming noise.
Okay, I'll tell you what we'll do, the first thing when we get up, we'll go out and take a look.
And if there's any flying saucer out there, we'll notify General Mayberry. Now how's that?
- But...
- In the morning!
- Okay.
- That's a fella. Good night now.
- What's the matter, Dear?
- You go on back to sleep, Mary.
- David all right?
- Oh, yeah, sure.
- I'm sorry I woke you.
- And what are you doing now?
Oh, nothing,
I'll be back in a few minutes.
- George, what is it?
- Well...
David says that he saw something land in fields out back.
It doesn't make sense, but he seems so convinced.
What does he mean, "land"?
Well, he said he saw a bright light or something, and... well, he's not the type of boy that's given to imagining things, you know.
After all, the work at the plant is secret, and we have orders to report anything unusual.
- And there have been rumors.
- Rumors?
Mary, you know I can't talk about that now.
I better go out and take a look.
Mrs. McLean, where is your son now?
He's still asleep,
I didn't want to wake him.
And your husband just put on his robe and slippers, walked out into those fields and disappeared?
I know it sounds insane, but if you'll only look and see if you can't find...
Mrs. McLean, did you husband ever disappear like this before?
Of course he never disappeared.
Now look, no offense, but you know how these scientists are sometimes...
My husband is a designer, an engineer, not a comic book professor.
- Please! If you'd only stop talking and go and look...
- Okay, Lady, okay!
We have to know all the facts, we've gotta make a report to headquarters, you know.
Let's go, Butch.
Well, there ain't nobody out here, that's for sure.
Flying saucers, disappearing scientists, what next?
Aw, c'mon, let's go back, he ain't out here.
Well, that suits me,
I could use some coffee.
- George McLean.
- So that guys was out here.
- Yeah, you take the north side, I'll take this way.
- Yeah.
There goes the coffee.
Hey! Jackson.
Jackson!
Hey Jackson, where did you go?
- Hi, Mom.
- Good morning, Dear.
- Did you have a good sleep?
- Gosh! Yes.
- What time is it?
- It must be nearly eight.
Where's Dad?
He left early.
Oh, gosh,
Dad promised me he'd go out...
Don't cuss this morning,
Mother's tired, and...
Any chance for a cup of coffee?
George, you're safe!
I was so worried.
What happened?
I thought he'd gone to the plant.
Never mind, David.
What did happen to you?
I stopped over to see Bill Wilson.
- In your pajamas?
- In my pajamas, obviously!
- But...
- Period!
- Where's your other slipper?
- I said period!
Well, I guess we better tell those policemen.
What policemen?
Well, I was so worried,
George, I called the police.
They're out there looking for you now.
- Go and call them, David, and tell them...
- Just stay where you are!
- Are they out there now?
- Yes.
What happened, George?
What is it?
I wish you'd please learn to mind your own business!
Those policemen, they'll ask questions, and I can't...
So what if they do? Why can't you...?
Am I gonna get my coffee?
Say, Dad, when you were out there, did you see anything?
Let's not start that flying saucer nonsense again!
- Hey, Dad!
- Yeah, what do you want?
What happened to your neck?
It looks like there's...
Nothing! I caught it on a barbed wire fence.
Barbed wire?
There isn't any barbed wire...
I caught it on barbed wire, I said!
Now you get your clothes on.
Yes, David, hurry and get dressed,
I want you to do some errands.
- I'm sorry, but I...
- Is this your husband?
Yes, I'm George McLean, I'm sorry my wife put you to so much trouble.
- Think nothing of it.
- You feel all right?
- Yes, I'm fine.
- Well, then we won't report this.
We'll forget the entire matter, won't we, Mary?
Yes.
Won't you have some coffee?
Don't be silly, Mary,. these gentlemen have some important work to do.
Yeah, you, too.
Yes, I know.
We'll see you around.
What are you gaping at?
What were those men talking about, as though you were in some kind of plot together.
Don't talk nonsense, Mary.
I thought I told you to get dressed!
Well? What is it?
- I was just looking for Mom.
- She's dressing.
- What do you want?
- Nothing.
- What are you up to?
- Nothing, just playing.
Get over to Andy's house and play there.
David... come here.
I wanna warn you, don't go spreading stories about things you imagined out in those fields.
Understand?
What was that?
Your son... said he was going over to Andy's.
Well, shall we go into town?
I want you to come outside first, there's... something I want to show you.
Mrs. Wilson, is Mr. Wilson around?
Why, no, David, he won't be home until this afternoon, he's out of town.
- What is it?
- Out of town? Are you sure, Mrs. Wilson?
My father said he saw him just this morning.
You must be mistaken, Dear, you're the first person who's been around here today.
Is something the matter?
Mrs. Wilson, Kathy's gone.
Gone? Whatever are you talking about?
Out by the sand pit,
I saw it through the telescope.
The ground opened up and something pulled her down.
David! Talk sense, where is she?
What's happened to her?
It's the truth, honest, Mrs. Wilson!
There's something out there...
Where is he?
Kathy, where have you been, what's happened?
Nothing, Mother,
I just picked you some flowers.
Oh, David, how could you come in here scaring me to death.
- I'm sorry, Mrs. Wilson.
- I should think you would be,
- making up a story like that...
- I'm sorry.
Mrs. Wilson! Mrs. Wilson!
Your house is on fire!
Now, David McLean, I've...
I'll call the fire department.
The fire department won't help, someone spilled gasoline down there and the
fire's spreading all over the place.
That's impossible, we keep our spare gasoline in the garage.
There's a can of gasoline on its side down
there with the top off, and that's what's burning.
Kathy, were you playing in the cellar?
No, Mama.
State 43559, please.
Hello?
Hello, David.
No, I'm sorry,
Professor Kelston is out.
Would you like to leave a message?
Do you know when he'll be back?
Well, he's not expected back until this afternoon.
Oh, geez.
Never mind, thank you.
Okay, Mr. Mitchell, thanks, come back.
Jim! Jim!
- Hello, David.
- You gotta help me!
They got Kathy Wilson, they've done something to my Dad.
Who? What?
I don't know, but I saw it,
I saw it land out in the field and...
Now, wait a minute, wait a minute, you saw WHAT land?
A spaceship or something,
I saw it.
- Are you being funny?
- No, it's the truth, I tell ya.
And the policemen, two of them, they did the same thing to them.
Who did what?
Please, Jim, you gotta believe me.
You've gotta help 'em, we've gotta help Dad.
- All right, David, just take it easy.
- Where ya goin'?
You just wait here,
I'm gonna make a phone call.
You're gonna call Dad!
No, you mustn't!
Now, don't worry,
I'll be right back.
I gotta see the
Chief right away!
The Chief, huh?
Must be very important.
Please, you don't understand,
I gotta see him.
Now, now, settle down, Son, what's the trouble?
- You can tell me.
- No! I gotta see the Chief.
That's what I'm here for... anybody who wants to see the
Chief, has to tell me why first.
I can't, there's no time, besides...
Oh, please, let me see him.
Besides, what?
- You wouldn't believe me, and...
- What makes you think the Chief will?
What's the trouble, Mack?
You got me, the kid here's got something so important that he can't tell anybody but you, on account of, "I wouldn't believe him".
- Are you the Chief?
- That's me.
- What I can do for you?
- I wanna talk to you alone.
In here.
- What's on your mind?
- Well, Sir, it's kinda hard to explain, but...
Start at the beginning, what's your name?
David McLean, Sir.
Are you George McLean's boy?
Yes, Sir, but I don't want my Father to know about it.
Finley, come in here.
Let go me!
Let me outta here!
They got him! I saw it!
He'll kill me if I tell!
Put him in the detention room, I'll have his old man come and get him.
- What's bitin' him?
- He's out of his mind, that's what.
Come on, Son, settle down, take it easy.
It's on his neck, too.
Please don't let my father get me!
Please don't let him get to my father!
They'll drag me down, like they did with Kathy! I know they will.
You leaving?
- You lock that crazy kid up?
- Yeah, he's really scared.
- Think maybe we oughta...
- His old man'll take care of him.
If he doesn't answer the phone,
I'll go out and find him.
Hello, Doc,
Sergeant Finley.
Come on over, will ya?
I have a kid here, something's eating him.
Well, I don't know, but I know kids, this one's really scared.
Thanks.
Hi.
- Who are you?
- I'm the Doctor Blake, David..
What kind of doctor,
I'm not sick?
I know you're not, but Sergeant
Finley said you had a story to tell... a confidential story.
Doctors are sort of like ministers, you can tell them anything.
So he thought
I might do.
Could I see the back of your neck?
What kind of nonsense is that?
Sure you can, help yourself.
- All right?
- Yes, I guess so.
- Well?
- I'll only tell YOU.
Is that all right?
Sure, we'll get along fine, won't we, David?
You have any trouble, just yell.
- Now...
- Well, it started last night, I was listening to my... and THAT'S the honest truth,
I know they're under there, but I don't know what they do to people.
But once they're down there, they act differently?
Gosh, yes! If you knew my Dad, there isn't anybody like him, not anybody, but today, he acted like somebody I never saw before.
You ask my Mom, she'll tell ya.
I have the same idea, David.
- Then, you believe me?
- I don't know.
It sounds so UN-believable, and yet...
- You wait here, David.
- You're not gonna leave me?
No, I'll be right back.
You don't haveta lock me in,
I won't run away.
I know you won't, but I have to obey the rules.
- Well?
- It's a new one on me.
Did two policemen report the disappearance of George McLean this morning and the search of the field behind his house?
No.
But they'd have to report a call like that, wouldn't they, even if he turned up later?
Sure, ya gotta report everything... in quintuplicate.
- Is the Chief in?
- No, he isn't back yet.
Is it all right if
I use his phone?
- Help yourself.
- Thanks.
- I'm Mrs. McLean.
- Well, glad you're here.
I saw Chief Barrows at the Bank, he said David was here.
He's here all right, he had a little scare.
If you'll just wait,
I'll get him.
- Hello, Stu?
- Oh, hi, Pat.
Yeah.
Why, sure I know David.
Yeah, he just called me a little while ago, I was out.
He used to use our telescope here before things got so hush-hush.
Well, no, no... no, not David, he's a pretty realistic young fella.
Oh, sure you can,
Pat, I'll wait.
Well, this may sound silly, but...
David tells me he's seen a spaceship.
Mom! Mom!
Come, David.
- No!
- Stop this, please.
You listen to me, you've caused us enough trouble, c'mon.
Just a minute.
Sergeant, that boy is not to leave this building.
Who are you?
I'm Dr. Blake, from the City Health
Department, and your son is in my care.
- He is NOT! Chief Barrows told my wife...
- I don't care what anybody told her, the boy stays here.
What has he been telling you?
He's been reading those trashy science fiction magazines.
He's completely out of control.
It may interest you to know, Mrs. McLean, that your son is running a high temperature, his heart action is unnaturally fast.
It's too soon to tell, but he had every symptom of Polio, and I'm having him removed to the isolation ward of the General Hospital.
No, he HAS to go with us.
If he's better in the morning, we'll discuss it then.
Now, you listen to me, we don't want you telling a lot of the idiotic stories.
Understand?
George, you know we can't leave him here, we have to take him...
Never mind, it can't be helped now.
Come on.
Mom, too.
That's the coldest pair I ever saw.
They're not, they're wonderful, they've done somethin' to 'em, somethin' awful.
Oh, well, come on, Son, I'll wrap up real warm and I'll take you to the hospital.
It's all right, there's nothing the matter with him.
Good thing I talked to Stuart Kelston about you.
I found out that you were the cold, scientific type, not given to flights of fancy.
- Do YOU know Dr. Kelston?
- Uh-huh.
He's my favorite astronomer.
Come on, David, let's get out of here before we get you trouble.
- But the Chief...
- You tell the Chief he's in my care.
Hello, operator?
Kelston, priority A14.
Closed circuit,
Coral Bluffs 127.
What's this all about?
Are they gonna do somethin' about my Mother and Father, Sir?
I hope so, David,
I hope so.
Hello, General Mayberry?
Oh!
Will you please tell him to call the moment he comes in?
This is WJ738.
Thank you.
You often need the best.
We were afraid you might laugh at us.
I'm not laughing.
What do you think it's all about, Stu?
Possibly what David thought it was.
A spaceship?
From where?
It could be from a mother ship,
in free orbit, just above the Earth's atmosphere.
But, where's this mother ship from?
David, from the Earth's point of view, which planet is nearest to us right now?
- Venus?
- Correct.
What I should have said, "Which planet is nearest to us in its particular orbit?"
- Mars.
- Right.
Only about thirty million miles away.
And here we are, moving around the sun, going more than a hundred thousand miles an hour.
And if we ever left our orbit, we could reach Mars within a few days.
Let's take a look through the telescope, shall we?
If Mars ever left THEIR orbit, they could reach US.
But, a hundred thousand miles an hour,
Wouldn't the friction burn them up?
In space there's no atmosphere, so... no friction.
But, a spaceship, where could it go?
- It went right in the ground, I saw it!
- Oh, it can't be underground!
"Can't" is what our grandparents said about the airplane.
Besides, we know nothing about these people.
- If they are people.
- What do you mean?
Here we are.
I'm not allowed to look through a telescope anymore.
Special occasions make special conditions.
We do know his, there isn't enough oxygen on Mars, and the surface is too cold to support human life as we know it.
There is a theory, consequently, that their cities are underground, near some central core of heat.
Or that they live in spaceships.
You don't believe that?
- I'm a scientist.
- But it can't be proved.
It can't be DISPROVED, either.
Could you disprove, for example, that the
Martians have bred a race of synthetic humans to save themselves from extinction?
- Synthetic humans?
- The theory calls them "mutants".
Mutants? What would they want here?
Coral Bluffs?
There you are, it's focused now.
A rocket? I thought they were testing some kind of atomic device out there.
It IS an atomic device.
The highest powered rocket ever conceived.
You see, once we can shoot a rocket far enough into space, it will just anchor there.
Then it's merely a matter of time before we set up interplanetary stations equipped with atomic power and operated by remote control.
Then if any nation dared attack us, just by pushing a few buttons, we could wipe them out in a matter of minutes.
So you think it's on account of the rocket that the...
Look, put the shoe on the other foot, say you're a Martian.
With the aid of these mutants you've developed a way of life to save your race.
Giant ships floating in space with sufficient oxygen to sustain life.
Then the inhabitants of another planet start shooting powerful rockets endangering your zone of survival.
Wouldn't you want to do something about it?
- But, Stu, it's fantastic.
- So was the airplane.
But look how it adds up...
What's David's father?
He's an engineer over at the Armstead plant.
What's made at that plant, David?
Gosh, I don't know,
Dad would never talk.
Because the plant your Dad works at, is where the whole motor assembly for that rocket was made.
But, what would they want with little Kathy Wilson?
Nothing, David, but Kathy's father is Dr. William Wilson.
The physicist?
The man who conceived that rocket, and whose house was burned down.
What did they do to Kathy?
How did they make her set fire to her house?
What have they done to my Mother and Father.?
Dr. Kelston, you know them, you know how nice they are, and...
I don't know the answer to that one, David.
Not yet, but we'll find out.
Now, let's take a look at the place where you saw the light disappear.
The fence! The wooden fence!
It used to stretch all the way across the sand pit.
I hadn't noticed before, it's gone!
Let's increase the magnification.
The path stops, too.
Dad!
Closer, Dr. Kelston!
- What! Why, it's General Mayberry!
- The one you tried to get on the telephone?
Yes, he's in command of Coral Bluffs.
Dad sent for him, he's trying to stop the Martians.
Dad, oh, Dad!
Just like Kathy!
Oh, not his father.
They HAVE got his father, now they've got General Mayberry.
Hello, operator?
Kelston.
Priority A14.
Coral Bluffs 127.
And hurry!
Colonel Fielding, please.
Right.
Get me the Chief of Staff at the
Pentagon. Be back in a second.
Two more companies for the Armstead plant.
Three more Coral Bluffs.
Two more at the
Magnesium Works.
Good, I want you personally...
Yes, Sir.
Anything else, Sir?
Right, Sir.
Get me the Chief of Police.
I don't know, Colonel, the Chief left here some time ago, and we haven't been able to contact him since.
We've been trying to reach his car by shortwave right along.
No, Sir, Officers Blaine and
Jackson are out of circulation, too,
I don't know where they are.
Yes, Sir, it'll be handled in strictest confidence.
Thank you, Sir.
That was Colonel Fielding, in charge of the Task Force at Coral Bluffs.
Off the record he's ordered a all-points alarm on McLean, the Chief, and McLean's wife, Blaine and
Jackson and General Mayberry.
Ya know, I'm awful glad I don't have to pick up the General, generals can get awful unpleasant.
Then you came, Sir, and that's all.
Well, thank you, David, that was a very clear account.
Now, can you tell us where to find this little Kathy girl?
The one who set fire to her house?
Where does SHE live?
Just down the road, it burned down.
Mr. Turner'd know where they are, though, he's their next door neighbor.
Good! I'd like you all to come with me.
Poor woman, she's almost out of her mind.
Who's to blame her.
First she loses her home and then her little girl, just like that.
You say she died instantly?
Yes, it was almost a matter of seconds, one minute she was playing, just as she always did, the next she keeled over as if she had been poleaxed.
- Okay, Mr. Turner, thank you.
- Just a minute, Colonel.
What was the report on the cause of her death?
Cerebral hemorrhage, they said.
I see, thank you,
Mr. Turner.
Where's Rinaldi?
Still in the house, Sir, guess he's still on the phone.
You know, Colonel, I think I'd like to go down to the hospital and take a look at that little girl.
Cerebral hemorrhage, that doesn't make sense for a young child like that.
But if she has a scar on the back of her neck...
Why, you're right!
I'll let my driver take you.
Oh, any authority that you need to get through the police or our own patrols, Doctor,
Jones'll be it.
We'll be at the McLean place.
Thank you, Colonel.
- You get that order through?
- Yes, Sir.
There's the place, Sir, right where the fence is.
Yeah, try to be exact, David.
Just where in relation to the fence?
- Oh, I dunno.
- You see, it's rather hard to tell exactly, we saw General Mayberry disappear from another angle.
I'll show you exactly, Sir.
Yeah, we're as close to that spot as anyone's gonna go for the present.
Here, see if these'll help.
Yes, yes, that's the spot.
The path used to go all the way across the sand pit, too,
just like the fence.
That's where they got Kathy, too.
Can I have a look, Sir?
There ya are.
Do you suppose there could be some sort of trap door out there?
Well, if there is, it's pretty well concealed.
No, Sir, there's no trap door out there.
Something would show, a crack or something, there's just nothing out there.
Well, what do you think?
Do you mean, do I think some sort of spaceship crashed through that sand pit?
- Yes.
- Well, let me ask YOU a question...
How would it get underground instantaneously without smashing up?
Well, if they had some sort of ray.
- Like an X-ray?
- Uh-huh.
Some radioactive ray that could eat through the earth.
Well, we'll soon find out.
Rinal...
Where'd Rinaldi go?
Hello, Clary, you all briefed on what's been happening?
- Yes, Sir, but...
- No buts, Major, it's all true.
- Hello, Roth, I'm glad you came.
- Hello, Sir.
Captain Roth is our expert on electronics.
And Dr. Kelston thinks there's a spaceship out there, underground.
Do you think that's possible?
Well, theoretically, yes, with infrared waves.
But nobody's been able to harness them yet, I mean on this planet.
Yeah, we're assuming these people are NOT from this planet.
Well, Sir, if they have a transmitter that can generate infrared rays, the way we generate shortwave rays for radio, there's no reason why they couldn't melt right through the earth, or anything else for that matter.
Well, that'd mean a pretty destructive weapon, wouldn't it?
Yes, Sir, there would be no effective counter-weapon.
Can I ask, Colonel, what our orders are?
Our orders are to secure all the installations in this area against any form of attack, and to explore beneath the surface of that sand pit area out there.
Excuse me, Sir, just where was it General Mayberry disappeared?
Right there, where that fence ends.
- Here, take a look with these.
- Oh, thank you.
There's Sergeant Rinaldi out there.
Rinaldi, always sticking his neck out!
You'd think after twenty years of service he'd know better.
- That sound!
- Here, give me these.
- It's got him! He's gone!
- You can't go out there, Colonel!
Rinaldi's been with me 20 years.
Let him be the last one they get, Sir.
We may have no counter weapon, but if it's a fight they want, war, they're gonna get it.
As soon as the rest of the lights arrive,
I want three more trained on that spot.
- Keep it surrounded.
- Very good, Sir.
I don't want anyone to go near there until I give the word.
I want the rest of the lights to keep the entire area swept constantly.
These devils might pop up somewhere else.
Sergeant, I thought I issued orders no one was allowed...
It's you, Doctor!
- Find anything?
- I found something very interesting.
The autopsy showed this, it WAS cerebral hemorrhage.
What do you make of this?
It seems to be some sort of kind of crystal attached to what looks like a piece of platinum.
- Where was this located?
- At the base of the skull.
When that globe exploded in the brain, it caused a hemorrhage.
And that's what killed her.
Mom, Dad.
Now, take it easy, Son.
They're not gonna use a complicated device like this just to kill people.
It involves surgery we've never know possible.
You know what I think, Colonel,
I think this little device attached to the brain, is some method of control.
We've made white mice follow directional impulses with high frequency oscillation.
Now, theoretically, there's only...
Do you mean that those Martians out there could be giving instruction right now to the people they've operated on?
And they do exactly as they were told?
Possibly, and then when they've served their purpose, they could loose a wave that would detonate that little bulb in the brain.
No!
It stands they've been operated on.
- Colonel, I think we can reproduce this.
- What for?
Well, if we had a reception unit like theirs, we might be able to get in on their wave length.
And intercept the messages?
No, not that, you see, their messages would be just meaningless impulses to us.
But we might be able to locate their point of origin.
- Well, get going, Captain!
- Yes, Sir.
Please, Sir, please hurry.
Colonel.
Fielding here.
Great.
No... no, nothing else.
The Armstead plant has just been blown up.
Halt! Stand as you are!
Stand back, don't touch him!
All right, c'mon, you, let's go.
What happened to him?
He was all right, then...
Yes, yes, go on.
No, take them to the morgue.
They got Jackson and Blaine, the two cops.
Both of them had that thing in their necks.
They're the ones that blew up the Armstead plant.
Were they killed?
No, they died just the way the little girl did.
Please, God, let them find Mom and
Dad before they do something awful.
I don't want them to die, too.
Halt!
Halt or I'll fire!
Give a near miss, that'll stop 'em.
You idiots!
I'm General Mayberry!
Sufferin' cats!
It is!
We got orders to bring you in, General, so drop what you got and hands up, both of ya.
Holy mackerel!
What was that?
Those suitcases must've been loaded with nitroglycerin.
It's for you, Colonel.
Fielding here.
Both of 'em blown to bits.
Yes, Sir, the rocket's okay.
Any further orders?
No, no further orders, just carry on.
Out men just got...
Tanks, in any normal war they're a beautiful sight, on your side.
Okay, Major Clary, if they got a ray down there, I don't know what good our tanks are gonna do, but we'll soon find out.
Have them surround that whole area.
Tell Lieutenant Blair to have his demolition crew ready. to plant C2 charges where
Rinaldi disappeared.
Right!
Colonel's orders, surround field.
All tanks surround field.
Right here.
All right, men, start digging.
Yes, Brainard.
What is it?
Nothing, Dr. Wilson, I just didn't expect to find you here tonight.
Sir, we're all DEEPLY sorry to hear about your little Kathy.
- There's nothing one can say, but...
- Thank you, Brainard.
You sure you want to keep on working, Sir?
- You wouldn't rather...
- Be somewhere else?
No thank you, Brainard,
I always work at night.
I must go on, you know?
- Good night, Brainard.
- Good night, Sir.
You can't park here, Lady.
Something's wrong with the car,
I think it's the ignition.
I wonder if you'd be kind enough to see if there's a wire loose.
Well,
I'm no mechanic but I'll take a look.
Put your foot on the starter.
- Is your ignition on?
- Oh, I'm sorry.
Keep that motor running!
Step on it, Corporal, get them to the hospital.
There's a chamber of some sort underground here! Give me the flashlight, Sergeant!
- You'd better let me go first, Sir.
- I'm giving the orders here.
The rest of you can follow me.
- Are you all right, Colonel?
- Yes, I think so.
Now, the rest of you come down by rope, it's a long drop.
All right!
Come ahead!
What do you make of it?
They must have a ray all right.
One that doesn't just blast its way through the earth but fuses it, as well.
Where's this earth and what's phosphorus?
It's not as bright as it was a few seconds ago.
Maybe because it's not longer in contact with the ray.
Now, what it doesn't tell us where they got to with Rinaldi.
They must've burnt themselves a tunnel out of here and then sealed it up after them.
And that leaves us knowing as little as we did when we got in here.
All right, get ready to haul away!
Okay! Go on!
Well, they've moved out of this spot.
Did you have any luck?
We've rigged the original crystal to a variable oscillator... here.
Now, if it hasn't been damaged, it
SHOULD give off some kind of vibration.
Well, these creatures can't be very far away... try it.
Yes, Sir.
WXPY, Sergeant Funston here, go ahead.
Hold it, I'll find out.
Is Dr. Blake here?
- I'm Dr. Blake..
- This is for you.
Dr. Blake.
Oh, who's operating?
Good, he knows how the wires are attached.
Call me the minute it's over, will you?
David's parents are in the operating room.
- I think I'd better tell him.
- Yes, I think you should.
- Getting cold, David?
- I'm all right, if only...
If only you get news of your Mother and Father, huh?
Let's take a little walk, David.
They've found your parents,
David.
Where? Are they all right? They're not... you know, they're not like Kathy?
No, David, they're not dead.
- Can I see them?
- Not just yet, David.
They're at the hospital and Dr. Metzler's going to operate.
- He's a fine brain surgeon.
- Brain surgeon?
Well, there's no reason why he shouldn't be able to remove the crystal.
And then they'll be safe, and nothing can happen to them, like... like what happened to Kathy.
No, David, they'll be all right.
When'll I know?
- Well, Dr. Metzler is not there yet.
- Not THERE yet?
You have to be patient, David, he has to come all the way from Middletown.
But, that's an hour away.
But there's no one here that can perform the operation.
But an hour!
In an hour the Martians could...
David, try not to think about it, they'll be all right.
But nobody's getting anywhere out there!
Nobody can locate anything! Anybody!
The Martians, they're gonna start to...
Roth! Fielding!
Over here! Over here!
Colonel! Quickly!
Over here!
Mutant!
Let me go!
Let me go!
- You want here, Sir?
- Right, just hold it a minute.
Let me go!
Let me go! Stop!
Colonel Fielding!
Keep on trying, Roth, they can't have gone very far.
There's nothing here,
Colonel, they already gone.
They disappeared here just a minute ago!
And we won't save them by blasting more holes where the Martians have already left.
Come on.
Stop! Let me go!
Let me go!
- Here! Here we are! We've located 'em!
- Lieutenant, set off your charge there!
Major, I want your tanks to fire shells from the opposite side of the field.
The more noise, the better.
Let the Martians think that's where we're hunting them.
And maybe they'll still be here when we blast.
All right, Sir.
Sergeant Rinaldi!
What is your name?
David, you know me.
Not you, YOU.
What is your name?
But you know, I'm Dr. Blake.
What are they doing up above?
What are they doing?
Who is he?
He is mankind developed to its ultimate intelligence.
These are his slaves, existing only to do his will, just as you will.
- What are they doing up there?
- I don't know.
You will tell him in a few moments.
Let's go!
Let her go!
Tell him to let her go!
Let her go! Tell him to let her go!
If you've done anything to my Mom and Dad, I'll...
Come on! Step on it!
On the double!
Stop! Let me go!
Let go!
Let go!
Let me go!
Colonel Fielding!
Colonel Fielding!
Colonel Fielding! Colonel Fielding!
Colonel Fielding!
Colonel Fielding! Colonel Fielding!
It's the boy! Come on!
What in the name of time is that?
Blast Him!
Come on!
Come on!
Now get clear!
Pat! Pat, are you all right?
They're getting ready to take off!
Blair, set up demolition charges, enough to blow this thing right back to Mars.
Where's David?
- And Rinaldi?
- I don't know.
Baker, form as many squads as it takes.
Comb every tunnel leading out of here, you only got a few minutes.
We'll give you a signal, as soon as the demolition charges are set, this ship goes sky high.
- I'll take her top side, Colonel.
- Right.
Colonel Fielding! Colonel Fielding!
Colonel Fielding!
Come on! Step on it! Search every tunnel, we gotta find Rinaldi and the kid, and the girl...
Lincoln, get back here on the double!
Colonel Fielding!
- Halt!
- What is it, Sir?
I thought I heard something.
Go ahead.
This place is crawling with them big apes.
Get everybody out of here,
Sergeant.
Everybody clear out but Jack.
- You and I'll try to hold 'em.
- Warning, Colonel.
That's emergency retreat, how much longer, Lieutenant?
We're set, Sir, at what interval should I set it for to fire?
Six minutes, that'll give us time to get above.
Let's move!
Let's seal it up good, Lieutenant, give me a grenade!
If any of those apes touch around, they won't get into the detonator now.
Colonel Fielding!
Colonel Fielding!
They've sealed up the exit tunnel.
If we don't release that detonator, we'll be blown to smithereens.
We can't release it now!
We can't get back on the spaceship!
How much longer, Lieutenant?
- About three minutes.
- Start digging!
Ya gotta hit 'em right in the PUSS with the grenade if ya wanna stop 'em, Major.
If nothin' works, we blow 'em apart!
Here they come!
Hold it!
It's the kid!
A coupla more, we're blowin' this place up, we gotta get outta here!
It's Rinaldi, Sir, he's alive.
Well, take him, but hurry!
What's the hurry, Major, we're sealed in, there's no way out.
There is! With this!
- How much longer?
- Just under two minutes.
- How much time now?
- Ninety seconds.
- He's just out, Colonel.
- Stay with him.
- Can you work it, David?
- Yes, Sir.
Give him a hand, will ya?
All right, stay clear, Men!
Come on!
Hurry up, everybody!
Hurry up, Harry, send the boy up first!
Easy!
How are... Rinaldi.
All right, move way back, the whole thing's gonna blow up.
Come on! Let's go!
Colonel Fielding!
Colonel Fielding!
It's the boy! Come on!
Mom! Dad!
Are you all right?
- Of course we're all right!
- Whatsa matter, Son?
- That lightning scare ya?
- No, it wasn't that.
Didn't you got to the hospital?
Why, no, we've been sleeping.
You've nothing to be afraid of.
Ah, now, what's wrong?
It was horrible, I thought they did something awful to ya.
They were green, they had a ray gun, and that fence was gone.
- What fence?
- Across the sand pit.
Well, let's go out and have a look at it.
It's back now.
Well, if it's back, and we're the same, then you were dreaming, Son.
I guess so, only...
Go to sleep, now.
Gee, whiz!
Ah, Satan, Mon Cher.
You are late, yes, you are.
Still looking for your girlfriend, huh?
Mademoiselle Dandelo has found another.
You will never see her again.
But don't you worry. There will be others.
Eh, madame?
Yes?
Yes, who is this?
This is François Delambre speaking.
Helene? How are you, Helene, dear?
What can I do for you?
François, I've killed Andre.
- I need your help.
- Now, look, Helene, it's past midnight.
I've had a hard day. I love you both dearly, but this sort of a joke...
It's true.
I've killed Andre.
You killed... But...
Please help me.
Call the police and... Come quickly.
I just can't...
Helene.
Helene?
- Yes?
- Monsieur François? Gaston.
I tried to call you.
Something terrible has happened.
A man is dead.
His head is under the press.
And I saw a woman running...
Running away.
Yes, Gaston.
It looked...
I think it was Madame Delambre.
You stay there, Gaston.
I'll get the police immediately.
Anthenium Club?
Is Inspector Charas still there?
Yes, thank you.
Yes, I'll wait.
Check.
Sorry to interrupt, sir.
There's a call.
Thank you.
- Hello?
- Inspector?
This is François Delambre. You may remember, we met a few times at the club.
It's just... I'm sorry to call you so late, but, well, I'm in terrible trouble.
- Trouble, monsieur?
- My sister-in-law just phoned.
She'd killed her husband, my brother... My brother, Andre.
What? At our factory,
Delambre Freres.
Our night watchman called too.
There is a body.
Where are you now,
Mr. Delambre?
I'll pick you up in a few minutes.
Good-bye. You'll have to excuse me.
- Inspector, Helene lives just...
- No, we ought to look here first.
- But I've got to talk to her.
- Please, I've already sent a man.
She'll be all right.
It's Andre.
- How can we raise the press?
- I'll do it for you.
Would you like us to get one of your men?
I'll be all right.
Whenever you're ready, monsieur.
Dead about 30 minutes.
- Is the downstroke fast?
- No.
About the same.
- No danger of it coming down again?
- No.
It's been set for 50 tons.
- Impact zero.
- Zero?
Yes. That means level with the bed.
- It's never been set that way. Never.
- Oh?
That would squeeze the metal to nothing.
It's been set for single strokes too.
She didn't know how to operate the press.
- Are you sure this is your brother?
- Well, he...
There was a long scar on his left leg. War wound.
- I'll... Would you mind?
- Doctor.
I can't believe it.
Can you think of any reason why she would do such a thing?
None. Absolutely none.
They were completely happy together.
They have a wonderful little boy,
Philippe, whom they both adore.
Helene was always so gentle.
It just doesn't make sense.
Andre loved two things, his family and his work.
It's impossible.
- What is it, monsieur?
- The stroke count.
- That's the stroke count.
- I don't understand.
Whoever did this to Andre...
It reads two.
- They did it twice!
- Twice?
Oui, monsieur.
I heard the press come down two times.
- Good evening, monsieur.
- Good evening.
- Is it true?
- Doctor.
Yes.
- Did Helene...
- Listen, I can't believe it.
Inspector, this is our family physician, Dr. Ejoute.
- Inspector Charas.
- Your man called me, so I came.
- How is she?
- Quite calm now.
Almost in a state of euphoria, of relief, as though she's happy about it.
Is she insane, Doctor?
Helene Delambre could've never killed her husband.
It's impossible.
Unless she is or was insane.
- Did she tell you anything?
- Nothing, except she killed him.
And how... No, there's nothing in her that could make her do that.
Why, Inspector,
I've known her all her life.
I even delivered her.
She and Andre were devoted to each other.
- Where is Madame Delambre?
- In the living room.
François, I'm sorry I called you.
As you see, I could've called the police myself. I'm all right now.
Helene, my dear, you know if there's anything I can do...
You're the police?
Inspector Charas, madame.
Helene, what's going on?
Why do you say you killed Andre? Why?
It's all right, François.
Everything's all right now.
Madame, would you tell us what happened?
Of course, monsieur.
I killed my husband,
Andre Delambre, about half an hour ago in the hydraulic press shed.
You understand the gravity of the crime.
You say you killed your husband.
That means you murdered him.
I killed Andre, yes.
- Why?
- I cannot answer that question.
- How did you kill him?
- With the hydraulic press.
- How do you operate it?
- First you put on the main switch.
Then you set the stroke to whatever tonnage you want.
You set the stroke to maximum, that is, level with the table, or zero.
Then you press the release button.
It's the red one.
You mean you put your husband under the press?
No, Inspector.
He did that himself.
He put his head and his arm under the press?
- Yes.
- Why?
I cannot answer that question.
Coffee, Inspector?
Yes, ple... Gentlemen, would you wait for me outside, please?
Yes, of course.
No, thank you.
Now, madame, you were happy with your husband?
There were no mistresses.
I had no lovers.
We were both very happy.
- That is the truth.
- Then why did you kill him?
I wish to help you all I can, Inspector, but I cannot answer that question.
You pressed the button and it was all over.
Yes.
- Why did you press it twice?
- Oh, it was only once.
The stroke count read two.
A machine cannot lie.
Oh, yes. Yes, it was twice.
I... I was wrong.
- I did it twice.
- Why?
Perhaps you will wait, madame?
Of course, Inspector.
What would you advise, medically, Doctor?
Rest. Maybe in a day or two, her state of mind will improve.
Very well. You understand the lady is under surveillance.
I'll arrange for one of our nurses to take charge of her.
Of course. Thank you very much, Inspector.
You can rely on me.
Well, what do you think?
Would you show me your brother's laboratory?
Yes, of course.
This way.
This is the work of a madman!
There was over $200,000 worth of special equipment here.
Andre was always so careful of everything.
Special equipment?
What was all this for?
I don't know. It could have been anything, any one of a dozen ideas.
He... Well... When he'd develop something, he would show it to me.
He was working on an idea for the Air Ministry.
Perhaps they'd know.
I imagine electronics is a profitable field these days.
Yes, very. We own the business jointly.
We both have more money than we know what to do with.
They had no outside interests.
None, I'm sure of it.
That's why it doesn't make sense.
You're very attached to both of them, aren't you?
Yes. Inspector, what does all this mean?
I have no idea.
She would tell me nothing except that she'd killed him.
There appears to be no motive, no reason except insanity.
And even that leaves several important questions unanswered.
Perhaps he committed suicide.
Well, if he did, why does she say she killed him?
And if it was suicide, why such a clumsy method?
And why involve your wife?
And she was there.
She could hang for this.
Poor Philippe.
What will I tell him?
How does one tell a child?
If I may suggest, you could look after the boy for a while.
What's gonna happen to her?
We'll keep her under observation for the moment.
There's plenty of time.
Did your brother ever experiment with animals?
Never.
- Or insects?
- Insects? No.
That would be funny if...
No, Helene and Andre believed in the sacredness of life.
They wouldn't harm anything, not even a fly.
Lunch, madame.
Oh, I'm eating much too much.
At this rate,
I'll gain pounds.
- Can I get up today?
- Ask Dr. Ejoute, madame.
Every time I ask him, he says "Tomorrow."
You're coming along nicely.
The rest will do you good.
Is Inspector Charas coming today?
He did not say, madame.
I like him.
He's been very gentle.
I hope François brings that nice little boy today.
What is his name?
Philippe?
Yes, Philippe.
A nice boy.
They think I'm mad, don't they?
They never tell me what they think about.
Go away.
Go away!
- Is it bothering you?
- No. No, it doesn't bother me.
- I'll soon rid you of the pest.
- It's all right, Nurse Andersone.
Please leave it alone!
But, nurse!
Stop it, nurse.
Stop it!
Leave it alone!
Leave it alone!
- No! No!
- What is the matter?
- Let me look at that fly!
- You get back into bed!
- Please let me look at the fly!
- Back into bed.
Get out of my way!
Where is it? Where?
Oh. Oh, there.
Come on.
Come on, madame.
Come on.
Come on, madame.
- It's just a common housefly.
- Yes.
Perhaps it's symbolic of something deep in her subconscious, as her psychiatrist believes.
Mr. Delambre, do you think she's mad?
It's obvious, isn't it?
In spite of what the doctors think,
I believe Mrs. Delambre's mind is quite clear.
- Even when catching flies.
- How can you say that?
She must be mad.
What about Philippe?
She acts as if the boy were mine and not hers.
She may be trying to protect him.
- Perhaps she fears him or even hates him.
- That's impossible.
Helene couldn't hate anyone.
You must be out of your mind.
You're in love with her, aren't you?
- Yes.
- Then why didn't you marry her?
Because she loved my brother.
I don't think she ever noticed me.
I'm glad you're being honest with me.
You see, at first
I suspected you.
Me? Why should I do such a thing?
Motive one, for his wife. Motive two, to gain control of Delambre Electronics.
What do I care about motives?
Helene is in trouble and Andre's dead.
It's... It's like a nightmare.
I know now you had nothing to do with it, but I had to check for her sake.
I'm sorry, Inspector.
I'm a fool.
You've been so patient. Forgive me.
It's just...
I understand, monsieur.
It is I who should apologize. I have to pry into all sorts of personal things.
It's necessary, unfortunately.
Thank you for coming.
If there's anything
I can do to help, I will.
Did you discover what your brother was working on?
No. The Air Ministry scientists have been through all of his papers. Everything.
They didn't mean a thing to them.
We couldn't decipher the ashes.
Nothing there either.
Well, I've delayed all I can.
We've been quite patient with the lady.
I'm afraid I shall have to ask for a warrant tomorrow.
- The courts can decide.
- Tomorrow?
The charge can only be murder.
I'm sorry for you and the boy, but I cannot conceive of any verdict except guilty, or guilty but insane.
- Thank you, Yvette.
- Uncle?
- Yes, Philippe?
- When's Daddy coming home?
- Soon.
- Can I see Mommy again tomorrow?
- Yes.
- She's very sick, isn't she?
Yes, Philippe, she's very sick.
Do flies live a long time?
I don't know. Why?
Because I saw that fly
Mommy was looking for again.
I didn't know your mother was looking for one.
Oh, yes, she was.
It's grown quite a lot, but I recognized it, all right.
- Mmm, this is good.
- How did you recognize it?
Its head is white instead of black, and it has a funny sort of leg.
It was on your desk this morning.
Oh? I didn't notice it.
When did you first see that fly?
The day Daddy went away.
I had caught it, but Mommy made me let it go.
Then later she wanted me to find it again.
She changed her mind.
You know how women are.
Excuse me, Philippe.
I won't be a moment.
Inspector Charas.
Inspector Charas.
- Good evening, Nurse.
- Why, Mr. Delambre.
Inspector Charas told me about her relapse. How is she now?
Resting quietly, poor lady.
But monsieur...
The inspector told me that I might speak to her for a few moments alone.
- He knows I'm here.
- But he didn't say you were coming.
He has so much on his mind.
I won't be long.
Oh.
François, I didn't hear you.
You look tired.
Of course.
Just the office, you know.
You shouldn't work so hard.
- How are you?
- I'm fine. I feel all right.
I'm glad you came.
I wanted to ask you something.
Of course, Helene.
Anything at all.
How long do flies live?
Oh, I don't know.
I think a month, two months.
The fly you were looking for was in my study today.
- Did... Did you kill it?
- No.
You have it with you?
Give it to me.
- Please, give it to me!
- I haven't got it here.
Oh.
- You know now.
- What is this all about?
You haven't got it, or you wouldn't ask.
Yes, I have it. It's locked in my desk.
Tell me what happened.
No, never.
Andre wouldn't want me to.
I know you're not mad.
I want the truth.
Either you tell me, or I'm going to give it to Charas.
You swear you have it?
Yes.
If I tell you, will you promise to destroy it?
- I can't do that until I know...
- Then I can't tell you anything.
For your own sake you've got to tell me.
You're all right, or you can be all right perhaps.
As soon as they examine it they'll know, and they'll know you're not insane.
No!
For Philippe's sake,
François, I beg you.
Don't you see? I was pretending to be mad for Philippe's sake.
Better that I should be declared insane, than he should be the son of a woman hanged for murder.
I want to know.
Either you tell me now, or I give the fly to Charas.
If I tell you, will you tell them?
I only want to help you.
I can only do that through them.
Yes, I would tell them.
Poor François.
Call Charas then.
I can't tell it twice.
So long as you'll kill the fly.
You promise?
Yes.
This is not a confession.
Although I killed my husband,
I am not a murderess.
I simply carried out his last wish.
A few months ago...
Who's a ticklish boy?
Why don't you pick on somebody your own size?
Andre! What a pleasant surprise.
Hi, Daddy. Are you gonna play with us?
Later, Philippe. I've got to borrow your mother for a moment.
But I won't be long, I promise.
I'll tell you what.
Before you go to bed,
I'll play with you, all right?
- Promise?
- Promise.
- All right then. I'll play with Dandelo.
- Good.
Be gentle with her, Philippe.
Come on. I've got to show you something.
But, Andre, we don't see you for days on end.
- Then suddenly you expect...
- Don't argue with me. Come on.
But...
I'd no idea you'd made so many changes.
- A completely new line of research.
- Let me guess.
- The permanent battery.
- Mmm-mmm.
Not the portable reactor?
I'll show you, but there must be absolutely no mention of this made to anyone.
- Of course.
- It's much too important.
Helene, you're the first to see a miracle.
- Remember this?
- Oh, of course.
Our wedding present from my devoted and very rich Aunt Bess.
Mmm-hmm. The family heirloom.
Hurry, put them on.
Now watch the box.
You can take your goggles off now, darling.
It's gone.
Come on.
- It's the same one.
- Mmm-hmm.
- Have you turned magician?
- In a way.
For a split second, an infinitesimal part of a second, this was disintegrated.
For one little moment it no longer existed, only atoms traveling through space at the speed of light.
Then here, a moment later, integrated again into the shape of an ashtray.
Oh, you're joking.
Doesn't sound possible, does it? But it is true.
It is impossible. You're playing some joke on me.
Take television.
What happens?
A string of electrons, sound and picture impulses, are transmitted through wires or the air.
The TV camera is the disintegrator.
Your set unscrambles, or integrates, the electrons back into pictures and sound.
- Yes, but this is different.
- Why?
Well, because it's impossible!
Fifty years ago, if my father were told he could sit in Montreal, and watch a World Series in New York the exact time it was happening, he'd say it was impossible.
- This is the same principle exactly.
- But it's not the same.
- This is solid.
- Oh, no, it's not.
To your touch, maybe it is.
In reality, it's billions of atoms, which we believe are only a series of electrical impulses.
Uh...
You actually did this?
It's no trick?
No.
I can transport matter, anything, at the speed of light perfectly.
Oh, of course this is only a crude beginning.
But I've been lucky enough to stumble on the most important discovery since man sawed off the end of a tree trunk and found the wheel.
The disintegrator-integrator will completely change life as we know it.
Think what it'll mean.
Food. Anything.
Even humans will go through one of these devices.
No need for cars or railways or airplanes, even spaceships. We'll set up matter transmitting-receiving stations throughout the world, and later, the universe.
There'll never be a need of famine.
Surpluses can be sent instantaneously at almost no cost anywhere.
Humanity need never want or fear again.
I'm a very fortunate man.
I'm a very fortunate woman.
I hope you don't transmit me.
I wouldn't want to come out like this.
What do you mean?
Well, it doesn't matter, does it, Andre?
Andre.
It's perfect.
Everything checks.
It's perfect.
Perfect.
Dandelo!
What's the matter? You hungry?
There we are.
That's it.
You won't feel a thing,
Dandelo.
And tomorrow you'll be the most famous cat in all the world.
Dandelo!
Dandelo.
Hello?
Oh, François, how nice to hear you.
Important?
You're getting married.
No.
No, not yet.
I think I like it this way.
It's just that there's no hurry.
Is Andre there?
Andre?
I've seen him about two hours in the last two weeks.
He eats and sleeps in his lab.
He won't talk or answer the telephone.
- I don't want to hear one more word!
- I don't want to!
- You're going to eat your dinner now!
- I don't want to!
Philippe's acting like a juvenile delinquent. Dandelo's disappeared.
I've even got to go to Professor
Augier's this evening alone.
You know how he is, Helene.
It's just until he solves his problem, whatever it is. Be patient.
How you men stick together.
Anything I can do? All right, François.
I'll tell him if I see him.
I gotta run now, François.
Good-bye.
Well!
Where have you been?
Listen, darling, I'm sorry about the last couple of weeks.
I had a little setback, but it's all right now.
- Oh, I didn't mind.
- Hmm?
Well, maybe just a little.
Call Augier and cancel out.
We're going to celebrate by ourselves.
Wonderful.
I didn't want to go anyway.
François just called about some special equipment. He's sending it now.
Good. By the time you've changed, I'll be ready.
- Changed?
- I've got tickets for the ballet.
- The ballet!
- We'll eat at the Tour d'Eiffel first.
- Oh, wonderful!
- Now hurry.
We'll finish a delightful evening with reintegrated champagne.
Finish?
- Well, not quite.
- Oh? What then?
What do you suggest?
You're in an unscientific mood.
You don't approve?
I didn't say that.
Will the champagne be as good as ever?
Exactly the same, bubble for bubble.
Here.
- The label's perfect!
- Of course!
Oh, it's so cold!
And it'll stay that way until
I show you something else.
Oh?
No, Andre, don't!
It might not work. I won't allow it!
- It'll be all right.
- Andre, please!
Put your goggles on, darling.
It's astounding!
It works!
I test-ran it this morning. It's all right.
You've succeeded completely.
It's unbelievable.
We'll have to wait and see.
I'll know for sure in a few weeks.
- I don't understand.
- To see if it suffers from ill effects.
- Oh.
- If it's alive in, say, a month, then we'll pronounce the experiment successful.
May I look after him?
It's still a her, but you can.
For one whole month she's mine.
Don't kill her with overfeeding.
It's a little frightening, isn't it?
Yes.
The first live experiment was disastrous... Dandelo.
Dandelo?
Andre, how could you?
She disintegrated perfectly but never reappeared. I don't know why, even now.
I redesigned the projecting device, and now it's perfect.
Where's she gone?
Into space, in a stream of cat atoms.
It'd be funny if life weren't so sacred.
Andre, promise me one thing.
No more experiments with animals.
I promise. No more experiments with animals.
It's frightening.
It's like playing God.
God gives us intelligence to uncover the wonders of nature.
Without the gift, nothing is possible.
Oh, Andre, I get so scared sometimes.
The suddenness of our age, electronics, rockets,
Earth satellites, supersonic flight, and now this.
Oh, it's not so much who invents them, it's the fact they exist.
But you're not frightened of TV or radio or X-rays or electricity, or that the Earth is round.
No, but everything's going so fast.
I'm... I'm just not ready to take it all in.
It's... It's all so quick.
Just do like Philippe does.
Accept them as part of our normal life.
They're facts, wonderful facts.
Which brings me back to the champagne.
I love you so much, Andre.
It's wonderful being married to you.
And to you, my love.
You're the healthiest guinea pig in the whole world.
Andre!
- You'll catch cold.
- Not today.
- What are you doing?
- Oh, just looking at the sky.
- Looking at God, perhaps.
- You're a strange man, Andre.
So precise and practical, and yet so...
- I don't quite know how to put it.
- So aware of the infinite?
The more I know, the more sure I am I know so little.
The eternal paradox.
You said you were frightened by progress.
I'm filled with the wonder of it.
- Spring will soon be here.
- I like spring the best.
All life growing, renewing itself.
- It's fantastic to be alive.
- How do you mean?
Oh, I don't know.
It's just...
I'm just so happy to be alive, that's all.
So am I.
Would you marry me again if you had your time over?
I think so.
Well, I've got a lot to do.
- Oh, François is coming to lunch.
- Oh?
Bring him down to the lab.
We'll show him now.
Shall I call Professor Augier and the Air Ministry scientists too?
Now, there's no hurry.
I... I don't even know how or why parts of it work yet.
It's too important.
It's too impossible.
Poor François.
He'll never believe it.
Don't stay out too long, darling.
You look tired.
The last thing I am is tired.
And we're finishing with crepes suzette.
What's all the celebration about?
I'm only coming for lunch.
- Andre wants to show you something.
- In the lab?
- Mmm-hmm.
- What is it? Flat screen?
It's better.
No more questions. Come on.
I've only been invited into the laboratory three times.
Each time I came out with a potential fortune.
Oh, dear. We won't see him for lunch.
I see what you mean.
His writing gets worse and worse.
Mommy! Mommy!
Where are you?
Coming, Philippe.
Yes, darling?
- I got something to show you.
- I have something to show you.
I caught such a funny-looking fly.
You want to see it?
Let it go. You know your father disapproves of you catching insects.
But this isn't like any other fly I've ever seen.
It has a funny white head and sort of white leg.
Now, you let it go at once.
Go along. Do as you're told. Go on.
Look at all that dirt you brought in.
Best fly I ever caught.
- Was there anything else, madame?
- No, thank you. Good night.
Shall I leave something for the master?
Didn't touch a bite of his dinner.
Oh?
I fetched up his tray about an hour ago.
It was still outside the door.
Had his favorite pastry on it too.
Never mind. He probably didn't hear you knock. I'll see if he wants anything.
Thank you.
Good night, madame.
Good night, Emma.
Andre? Andre, I'm going to bed now.
Is there anything you want?
Andre!
"Helene,
I've had some trouble."
Trouble?
Andre, what's the matter?
Answer me.
"I'm counting on you not to lose your nerve, for only you can help me."
"I've had a serious accident."
"But I'm not in danger at the moment,"
"although it's a matter of life or death."
Andre!
"It's no good calling to me or saying anything."
"I can't answer.
I can't speak."
"You've got to do exactly and very carefully what I tell you."
"Knock three times to show you understand and agree,"
"then fetch me a bowl of milk laced with rum."
Bowl of milk? Andre!
- Anything I can do, madame?
- No. No, loan manage.
Go back to bed, Emma.
Good night, madame.
Ah!
"When you knock,
I'll open the door."
"Walk over to my desk and put the milk on it."
"Then go into the other lab and try to find a fly."
A fly?
"You will easily recognize it.
Its head is white."
Philippe-
Oh, Andre.
"Don't hurt it.
Just give it to me."
"Before you come in, you must promise to obey me implicitly."
"Do not look at me.
Talking is useless. I cannot answer."
"Knock three times to show
I have your promise."
"My life is in your hands."
You can depend on me, darling.
It's not in here.
If you can't talk, knock.
Knock once for "yes" and twice for "no."
Do you understand?
We'll find the fly tomorrow.
I promise.
Just as soon as it's light,
I'll start looking.
Now, why don't you go to bed?
I'll help you.
No one will see you. I promise.
Philippe caught a fly this morning.
He said its head was white.
I didn't see it.
I made him let it go.
"Come back in morning.
Will type explanation."
"Need you fresh and strong tomorrow.
Poor darling. Sorry."
I'm all right now, darling.
Don't worry.
I'll find that fly.
Do you need anything tonight?
Darling, please try and get some sleep.
Good night, darling.
Andre.
"Remember the ashtray experiment?
"I've had a similar accident."
"I transmitted myself successfully yesterday morning."
"But in the second experiment, a fly which I did not notice"
"was in the disintegrator with me."
"When we integrated again, our atoms were mixed."
"Now my only hope is to find the fly."
"I've got to go through the machine once more and pray our atoms untangle."
"If you can't find it,
I'll have to destroy myself."
Can I come back in?
Don't worry, Andre. I'll find that fly.
It can't be far away.
But you mustn't talk about destroying yourself. You mustn't.
I'll call Professor Augier and the other scientists. They can help you. I...
Don't be angry, Andre.
I only thought that...
Promise me that you won't do anything.
Let me see your face.
I won't be afraid.
All right.
All right, Andre.
All right.
- Flies, madame?
- Yes. Close the windows.
- Catch flies?
- I told you, Emma.
A fly escaped from the lab.
We've got to find it.
- It's got a white head.
- Mommy!
I don't know what's gotten into this house.
Mommy!
- Look. I caught lots of them.
- Where is it?
- Are you sure you caught it?
- Oh, the white one.
No. I haven't caught it yet.
I told you to find that fly.
I'm sorry, Philippe, darling, but you've got to find it.
The white one, only the white one.
- Gotcha!
- You fool!
I said catch them!
Don't kill them!
I'm sorry, Emma.
Please, just catch them.
Madame, there's one in the hall.
Where? Where is it?
Oh, it's no good, Emma.
We'll never find it.
Philippe?
Make some supper, Emma, would you?
I'm sorry.
It's... It's just that...
Come on, Philippe.
Go and get washed up for dinner.
There's a good boy.
All right, Mommy.
Oh, Philippe.
I see it.
Don't move.
Go and get some sugar, quick.
Give me the sugar.
And close those doors.
Now, stay back.
Got him!
- Good boy, Philippe. Careful now.
- Let me see.
Oh, no.
It's in back of the curtain!
Oh, don't harm it.
Don't hurt it.
Oh, God, don't let it get out.
You try and keep it behind the curtain.
I'll get it from outside.
Oh, no. Oh, God...
Please, God, don't let it...
Don't cry, Mommy.
Please don't cry.
We'll catch it tomorrow.
Don't worry.
Please don't worry.
Andre.
We caught the fly today, but it escaped out into the garden.
I'll look for it again tomorrow.
You eat. I'll read this here.
"if you had caught the fly, you would not be reading this."
"I know you will never catch it now.
It's hopeless."
"There are things man should never experiment with."
"Now I must destroy everything, all evidence, even myself."
"No one must ever know what
I discovered. It's too dangerous."
"I've thought of a way.
It's not easy, but I need your help."
Andre!
You can still reason, Andre.
You've got no right to destroy yourself.
You mustn't think about it.
You've still got your intelligence.
You're still a man with a soul.
You've no right to destroy yourself.
We'll find that fly tomorrow.
I know we will.
Think easy.
But you've got to give me more time.
Why?
Why won't you wait?
Then see Professor Augier and the other scientists. They'll help you.
They'll do anything to help you.
I've another idea.
You remember the ashtray experiment?
Go through again.
It worked before.
Why?
Please try it.
You've got to try it.
Please, Andre, for my sake.
Maybe it will work.
I beg you.
Oh, darling, I love you and I want you so much.
Please, please let this come out right.
Hurry, darling.
It will work.
It has worked, hasn't it?
You'll be all right now.
I know it's worked.
No! No! No!
A strange story, Mrs. Delambre.
It's almost impossible to believe, isn't it?
- What happened to his notes?
- He destroyed them.
- And the writing on the blackboard?
- I rubbed it out.
I see.
Well, I must be going.
Thank you for telling me.
Inspector, it wasn't wrong to destroy the thing?
A fly-headed human? No.
It wasn't Andre.
I couldn't have hurt Andre.
But I'm glad,
I'm glad the thing is dead.
I'll see you out, Inspector.
- Inspector...
- I'll be with you in a moment.
- Inspector...
- Do you believe the story?
Well, it explains all the facts, the reason for the press, the fly, everything.
True. But I asked you if you believed it.
Oh, I'm only a policeman, not a science fiction enthusiast.
But I do not believe what she said.
It... it can't happen.
But you don't...
Well, I... I mean, you didn't know Andre.
He was a genius in some ways.
Possibly. But matter cannot be transmitted. Oh, the story is impossible.
I'll be back at 10:00 with a warrant for her arrest on the charge of murder.
Nurse Andersone is under strict instructions not to leave her for any reason.
But, Inspector, it might be the truth.
It is the truth, to her.
I'm satisfied now.
She's quite insane. She won't hang.
- Well, I'm not satisfied.
- I wish I could help you, monsieur.
The lady's in need of a doctor's care, permanently.
There's no telling whom she might attack next. Perhaps the boy.
But there must be something we can do to prove...
There is.
Show me the fly.
- Good morning, Monsieur François.
- Good morning, Emma.
- How's the mistress, sir?
- Oh, as well as can be expected.
- Such a lovely lady.
- Yes.
Emma, when you had that mad search for a fly, did you see it?
- Oh, yes, I saw it.
- What did it look like?
Oh, just a fly.
I'd say it was a bluebottle.
You know, quite a large one.
- Did it... Did it look any different?
- Not to me it didn't.
She and Philippe were saying its head was white.
- But it was just a fly.
- Thank you.
May I fix you some breakfast, sir?
Nice cup of tea? Some coffee?
No, thank you.
Help! Help me!
Help me!
Help! Help me!
Please help me!
Help me!
We can manage quite easily.
Thank you, Mr. Delambre.
Well, I... I thought
I ought to be here.
Do you wish to check the warrant?
- As next of kin you have the right.
- No, I'm sure it must be all right.
- Madame? Time to get up now.
- Hmm?
Oh, I slept so well.
- Wonderfully. Is it a nice day?
- Yes.
- I think I'll have the silk one.
- Take this one.
- You must be warm.
- But I'm not going out.
Come in.
- Good morning, Mrs. Delambre.
- Inspector.
But I...
I don't understand.
I have a warrant for your arrest for murder.
And I must caution you.
Anything you say can be taken down and used in evidence.
But, Inspector,
I told you everything.
It is for the court to decide.
But you said it was not wrong to kill a thing.
- You have to come with us, madame.
- François, didn't you show them?
You didn't destroy it?
Inspector, you saw it.
I'm afraid I did not,
Mrs. Delambre.
I lied to you, Helene.
I never had it. I never had it.
You never had it?
If you'll just come with us, madame.
You never saw it?
Leave her alone.
She doesn't have to go with you.
I demand that I first have time to talk to my attorney.
Dr. Ejoute will care for her.
I've already consulted with him.
The patient is ready to leave.
- I don't believe it.
- I have his diagnosis,
- and his authority.
- No, no, wait.
Don't make things more difficult, monsieur.
- Here you go, ma'am. You'll be all right.
- No!
François, don't let them take me!
Don't let them lock me up!
François, please...
- Mommy! Mommy!
- Philippe.
Oh, François, do something.
Don't let him see me like this.
Please!
Philippe. You can't see her,
Philippe, not at the moment.
I'll take you for a walk.
I know. I'll take you to the movies.
But they don't open till this afternoon.
Then I'll take you this afternoon.
Is the ambulance for Mommy?
Yes.
Is she going to be all right?
Yes. All right.
- I ran all the way over here.
- Oh?
I wanted to see how she was.
- I wanted her to play with me.
- She'd like that, Philippe.
But she can't, not now.
- When's Daddy coming home then?
- Soon, Philippe.
- I saw that funny-looking fly again.
- Oh?
- Which show will we go to?
- Any...
You saw the fly? Where?
It's in a web.
A spider's going to get it.
By the bench in the garden.
- You're sure?
- Oh, yes.
Stay here a minute.
- It's in the garden. Come quickly.
- Please, Monsieur Delambre...
Philippe has seen it. It's there.
I beg of you. Please, please.
All right.
Show me where.
Here, Uncle François.
Wait in the house.
There's a good boy,
Philippe.
Help me! Please help me!
Help! Help me!
Please help me!
Please!
Go away! Go away!
No! No! No!
Charas.
Charas.
I didn't believe it, but you saw it.
- You saw it, didn't you?
- Yes, I... I saw it.
- I thought she was...
- As God is my witness, I saw the thing.
It's unbelievable.
I shall never forget that scream as long as I live.
You've committed murder, just as much as Helene did.
You killed a fly with a human head.
She killed a human with a fly head.
If she murdered, so did you.
I know. But who's going to believe us?
They'll think we're both mad.
But he could have started the press and got under it in time.
It could have been suicide.
Andre's mind was deranged.
Helene just tried to stop him.
But the stroke count?
I was the one who forgot to reset it after it was used the last time.
Yes. Yes.
It could have been suicide.
Oh, a great shot, Philippe.
- Oh, François. Thank you.
- Hello. You look wonderful.
- Hi, Uncle François.
- Hi, Philippe.
You taking me to the zoo like you promised?
- Yes, if your mother...
- Oh, you two run along.
We'll all have dinner together later.
Oh, good.
- Uncle.
- Yes?
Mommy told me about Daddy.
Something she said to ask you.
Why did he die?
Well, Philippe, he died because of his work.
He was like an...
Like an explorer in a wild country, where no one had even been before.
He was searching for the truth.
He almost found a great truth.
But for one instant, he was careless.
- That's what killed him?
- Search for the truth is the most important work in the whole world and the most dangerous.
I'd like that.
I'd like to be an explorer like him.
- Will you help me, Uncle François?
- Yes, Philippe.
- You better run and get a coat.
- Yes. Right away.
You're a dear one, François.
So kind and thoughtful.
Thank you.
Here I am.
Well, come along, you two.
I'll see you off.
Ave Maria, gratia plena,
Dominus tecum.
Benedicta tu in mulieribus,
et benedictus fructus ventris tui, lesu.
Sancta Maria, Mater Dei,
ora pro nobis peccatoribus,
nunc et in hora mortis nostrae.
Amen.
Well, what do you say?
I don't like it.
What is wrong with it?
There's nothing wrong with it.
I just don't like it.
Look here, my old friend.
Would...
You are my friend, aren't you?
Yes.
Well, would I suggest anything that might go wrong?
You would.
Look at the last time.
You were supposed to watch in the street.
How was I to know they kept dogs?
I've still got the scars.
I'll show you.
This ain't like that.
We don't have to break in anywhere.
It's all in the open.
Nothing can go wrong.
That's what you said the time before.
I got six months.
I've had enough of it.
All right, then.
All right.
We won't say no more about it.
Forget I ever mentioned it.
If you don't trust me, that's all right with me.
I'll just have to do it on me own, that's all.
All right, then.
I'm going home.
Of course, the doctor did say that I mustn't do anything that might strain my heart.
I'll see you tomorrow.
And, er...
I shall have the whole ten marks to meself.
- Ten?
- Ten.
- You said six!
- Ten, I meant.
Still, that don't worry you no more, does it,
'cause you ain't coming with me.
Ten. Ten marks... for a dead'un.
Yeah, well, like I say.
You gotta know where to find these things.
You gotta keep your eyes open.
Take this one, for a start.
He only got planted this morning, you know.
He'll be as fresh as a daisy.
Who is he?
Who?
Him!
Or is it her?
An 'er?
No, it can't be an 'er. It only came from the prison this morning.
Look, don't stand there talking.
Come on, we ain't got all night, you know.
'ere.
Come and have a look!
A baron!
Well... shall we get any more for him?
I ain't never seen a real-life baron before.
Come on, hurry up!
Blimey.
'ere.
It's a priest with no head!
What if he is a priest?
He's a dead'un, isn't he?
Still worth ten marks to me, isn't he?
Course, er... the head's a bit of a problem.
Good evening.
I am Baron Frankenstein.
Hear, hear.
- Hear, hear.
- Quite right.
I ask you, gentlemen, what do we really know about him?
- What do any of us know?
- Nothing at all.
He came here three years ago and set himself up in practice.
Before then, no-one had even heard of him.
Where did he study?
Where did he take his degree?
What's his background?
Do any of you know?
- No!
- No. No more do I.
Yet here he is, well-established.
The most popular doctor in Carlsbrück, by all accounts.
He hasn't applied for a place on the Medical Council.
I've even heard he says he can do without the Council.
Looks as though he's right there, doesn't it?
He's managed to steal half my best patients.
- And mine.
- And mine.
Exactly! And mine too.
Your wife amongst them,
I understand, sir?
Yes, well, I put a stop to that!
Gentlemen, gentlemen.
Well, the fact remains, gentlemen,
Dr Stein must be made to join this Council, or steps must be taken to see that he is no longer permitted
- to practise in this city.
- Hear, hear! Quite right!
Assuming he refuses to join, how do you intend to stop him practising medicine?
Mr President?
Erm... well, we have never attempted to prevent any doctor from practising in the city.
However, Dr Stein's refusal to join, er... to become one of us, is an affront.
- Quite so.
- Are there any suggestions?
- Oh, well, er...
- Send a delegation to see him.
Excellent. Delegation. Yes.
- Made up of, er...?
- Three.
Of course, three.
Yes, three.
Three doctors from the Council here.
- That is what I suggest.
- Seconded.
- All in favour?
- Yes.
- Fine. Fine.
- We ought to make an appointment.
- Hmm?
- He's right.
No-one gets into Dr Stein's surgery without an appointment.
Oh, he's most charming. So clever.
My dear Dr Stein,
Vera is in great distress!
Indeed, Countess Barscynska.
Please, would you...?
Well, I know that you insist that she's cured,
- but I see no improvement whatsoever.
- I understand.
She's weak and faint, the movement of every muscle is an effort.
Raise your head, Vera.
Higher, my child!
You see? No animation, no vitality.
You must revise your diagnosis.
Overhaul her!
Vera, my dear, go and prepare yourself. Yes, yes.
Now, let me see. What was your daughter's original complaint?
Really, Dr Stein!
It started with palpitations, then dizziness...
- Well, how could you forget?
- She's not my only patient, Countess.
Oh, those women outside.
I know most of them.
They're all in perfect condition.
Nothing wrong with them at all.
You should be my partner.
We could dispose of surgery in half the time.
That, of course, would mean half the money.
Oh, I know their fees subsidise your work at the poor hospital.
I know how good you are to the poor, Doctor.
But my daughter, Vera, she's all I have in the world.
Mm-hmm. Of course.
I'm afraid there's very little more
I can do for your daughter.
Doctors are not magicians. We cannot diagnose maladies which are not there.
You are a man, Doctor!
You can do a great deal for her.
Everything I have goes to Vera when she marries.
It was her father's last wish.
Now I'm having a musical evening soon.
I so much hope you'll be able to come.
Much as I like music,
I have very little free time.
Ah, poor man!
A life devoted to the needs of others.
No time for a life of your own.
There's always time for the important things.
- Doctor, I'm ready!
- So am I, Vera. You may come out.
Excuse me.
You see? Just a few steps and the poor child is exhausted.
Every movement is an effort.
- I'll go wait outside.
- No, please. It is better that you stay.
You always used your ear before.
I still use my ear.
This just magnifies the sound.
- Oh, Mama, it's so cold!
- Stand still, dear.
Now, breathe deeply.
I can't breathe. That thing's so cold.
Can you hear the palpitations with that?
Wouldn't it be better to use your ear?
There's, erm... three men to see you, Dr Stein.
They're from the Medical Council.
- They must wait until after surgery.
- Yeah, well, they seemed impatient.
When I've finished!
You're the doctor.
Have them wait in the ward.
- What? In the ward?
- In the ward!
And shut the door!
Oi, you! Tell Dr Stein
I want me rum ration!
Right, I'll tell him.
- Murdering butcher, that's what he is!
- Tsk-tsk-tsk-tsk-tsk.
He'd better not try and do nothing with me.
I'll strangle him with me bare hands, I will!
You're gonna frighten him.
How can I do me dance without me legs?
You'll have to learn to sing!
Ah, this way, gentlemen.
This way.
This is intolerable!
Gentlemen, you must remember that these are the poor.
The stench is enough to kill me.
Er... Dr Stein says for you to make yourselves comfortable in 'ere.
- Comfortable! You tell Dr Stein...
- Ooh!
Doctor...
There's Dr Stein, gentlemen.
Looking after the poor and needy.
Look at this. Interesting, isn't it?
Quite a work of art.
- What do you think, gentlemen?
- Er, why, it's, er...
- Very picturesque.
- We didn't come here to...
- You must have it off.
- Have what off?
This arm.
You'll have to strangle him with one arm, Harry!
He ain't gonna have my arm off, that's for sure.
If you'd rather die, it's up to you.
- Let him have it, Harry.
- The arm don't pain me none.
It's of no use to you.
- What do you mean, no use?
- Be quiet.
Five o'clock in the theatre.
Doctor, I won't be able to work no more.
- What is his work?
- Pickpocket.
Then you'll have to find another trade, or use the other hand.
Excuse me, gentlemen.
- Is he new?
- Admitted this morning.
- Oi, me pipe!
- What's your trouble?
It... it's me chest, guv'nor.
I'm not surprised.
You use it like a furnace.
It's amazing how dirty these people are, isn't it?
Keeps them warm, they tell me.
Well, hmm?
What can I do for you?
Well, er... I am the
President of the Medical Council.
Congratulations.
At our last meeting, it was agreed that you should become a member.
Really?
Have this new man washed, then I'll look at him.
- I'm greatly honoured, gentlemen.
- Then you accept?
- No.
- Huh?
Every doctor in the faculty regards your attitude as an insult.
When I arrived in Carlsbrück, without means or influence, and attempted to set up in practice,
I was met by a firm resistance from the Medical Council, which apparently exists purely to eliminate competition.
I have built up a highly successful practice, alone and unaided.
Having grown accustomed to working alone,
I find I prefer it.
- Do I make myself clear, gentlemen?
- Quite clear.
Thank you.
Good day.
- You haven't heard the last of this!
- A lot he cares!
What more can I do?
Well, he won't pick any more pockets with that arm.
And you'll have the parcel ready for my messenger when he calls?
Right, Doctor.
- Your supper's all ready in there.
- Good night to you, then.
- Good night, Doctor.
- And thank you.
A masterly dissection, Dr Stein.
You must forgive this intrusion.
Must I?
I wanted to renew our acquaintance.
After a few moments with you this afternoon,
I was sure I'd seen you before.
That's hardly surprising.
I've been practising here in Carlsbrück for the last three years.
Before that.
A little more than three years ago, at the village of Inkstadt,
I was attending the funeral of Professor Bernstein.
You've heard of him, no doubt?
Everyone has heard of
Professor Bernstein.
I was a last-year student at the university where he was lecturing when he... died.
- May I offer you some chicken, Dr...?
- Kleve. Hans Kleve. No, thank you.
Perhaps a little cheese?
I can recommend it.
The professor was buried in the family vault of Baron Frankenstein.
Shall I go on?
Please. Please do.
I'm the first, I suppose, to recognise you.
For what I am, or what you would have me be?
No, the resemblance is too striking.
That, and...
Your present activities lead to only one conclusion.
So, and what if I am this Baron Frankenstein?
Are you?
Just now, you were telling me.
Now you're asking.
Dr Kleve, why are you so interested in this gentleman?
I'm in search of knowledge.
Oh, knowledge? Ah, so that's it.
My name is Frankenstein, I'll admit.
But it's a large family, you know.
Remarkable since the Middle Ages for productivity.
There are offshoots everywhere.
Even in America, I'm told.
There's a town called
Frankenstein, in Germany.
Are you the Baron Frankenstein?
There are the Frankensteins emanating from the town of that name in Silesia.
Are you Baron Frankenstein?
Yes, Dr Kleve.
I was sure of it!
I told you that I'm in search of knowledge.
I want to learn more than any university could ever teach me.
I want to be the pupil of the greatest doctor, the finest medical brain in the world.
Your pupil, Baron Frankenstein.
Highly commendable.
And if I refuse?
You won't.
So, either I employ you in my researches, or...
Surely this is blackmail?
An ugly trait in a doctor.
I see it as an agreement of, shall we say... mutual reciprocation?
Your knowledge in return for my assistance.
And your silence?
- I'm not an easy man to work for.
- Few men are.
And when you've learned all you want to know, you might change your mind about keeping silent.
I wonder if I can trust you.
But then uncertainty is part of life's fascination, isn't it?
I'll take the risk if you will.
Will you accept me as your pupil?
Where did you study?
Under Professor Anderson in Edinburgh,
Dr Karl Strauss in Vienna, at the hospital in Paris...
Enough.
Unlike yours, my practice is negligible.
When do we start working together?
Now. Incidentally, Hans, you must exercise great caution when addressing me.
My name is Stein. Victor Stein.
Yes, of course.
The Austrian or Swiss branch of that family, Dr Stein?
Let's settle for Switzerland.
It's an exhilarating climate, if a little heady.
Please, do join me.
After supper, I'll show you round my laboratory.
- Evening, Doctor.
- Good evening.
The other one's down below, waiting for you.
Not the best setting for a laboratory, but it's ideal for my purpose.
Careful!
It would be a pity to lose you... so soon.
Surprised?
Originally, this was a wine cellar.
Karl, this is Dr Hans Kleve.
He is to work with us.
- Do we really need him?
- Oh, yes. I shall need an assistant.
Dr Kleve presented himself just at the right moment.
The doctor trusts me, Karl.
I hope you will, too.
Good.
Oh, this is Otto, our chimpanzee.
Karl, you collected the parcel?
Yes. Yes, Doctor.
It's over here.
Hans...
That's the arm of the pickpocket!
It is, indeed.
You need sensitive fingers to be a member of that profession.
It'll be very useful to me.
Now, come here.
Well, what is it?
- A brain.
- A brain?
If you put your hand too near a fire, what makes you snatch it away?
- The nerves.
- Exactly.
The nerves of the hand send a message to the brain, and the brain activates the muscles for withdrawing the hand.
But you don't put your hand too near the fire if you see it first.
The eye recognises fire as a harmful agent.
Let me demonstrate.
Now observe.
The brain, the hand, the eyes.
Watch the eyes.
Fascinating, isn't it?
So this is a brain.
All this paraphernalia, and capable of only one simple reaction.
Imagine for one moment the complexity of the human brain, the same size, perhaps, but a million times more efficient.
It controls every action, every reaction, stores memories, it motivates all life, and this is all I've been able to do.
But you should be proud.
I've never seen anything like it!
Haven't you?
No, I don't suppose you have.
You know that I... that Frankenstein, was condemned to death?
- Yes.
- Do you know what for?
But surely everyone knows?
The story's become a legend.
He created a man who became a monster.
It should have been perfect.
I made it to be perfect.
If the brain hadn't been damaged, my work would have been hailed as the greatest scientific achievement of all time.
Frankenstein would have been accepted as a genius of science.
Instead, he was sent to the guillotine.
I swore I would have my revenge.
They will never be rid of me.
This is something I am proud of.
Who is he?
Nobody.
He isn't born yet.
But this time he is perfect.
Except for a few scars, he is perfect.
And you made this body from other bodies?
Yes. My voluntary work at the poor hospital serves me very well.
All I need is the brain, and then I can give it life.
You've seen the result of this, and it's by no means my first attempt.
I only keep this cumbersome thing to remind me of the impossibility of the task, should I ever think of trying again.
No, the brain must be a living one.
Unlike the limbs, life cannot be restored once life has gone.
The brain is life, and so a living brain must be used.
But surely that would mean committing murder?
No, not necessarily.
I have a volunteer.
He's here, in the laboratory.
No, Hans, not you.
No, your brain is too valuable where it is.
His over there.
- You mean Karl?
- Yes.
We made a bargain.
If he saved me from the guillotine,
I would give him a new body.
Yes, but his paralysis. Surely that indicates an injury to the brain?
I examined him thoroughly.
The paralysis is due to a blood clot.
It can be dispersed during the operation.
Karl has a fine brain.
He's quick, intelligent, and he's absorbed a great deal of knowledge since working with me.
Haven't you, Karl?
Dr Stein is welcome to my brain.
As long as he rids me of... this.
You must have great faith in Dr Stein?
I have.
Are you sure it can be done?
The operation will be a complete success.
There's a... a young woman asking for you, Doctor.
She's a real lady.
She's got scent on.
Must have come to the wrong surgery.
Finish dressing that, will you?
- Right, Doctor.
- Where is she?
She's in the Doctor's room.
Good morning.
Good morning.
Er... Dr Stein's not here,
I understand?
No, no. He's at his surgery in town.
- Um... would you like to sit down?
- Yes, thank you.
- You don't mind if I get cleaned up?
- No, please do.
I'm Margaret Conrad.
I shall be working here.
Oh? The Doctor didn't tell me about that.
My father is the Minister.
Dr Stein has been informed.
I see.
I shall read to the sick.
Shop for them, you know.
Get them things like tobacco, writing paper, soap.
My dear lady!
They seldom wash, and they never write.
But I'm sure you'll be able to find plenty to do.
Thank you.
I won't disappoint you.
Or Dr Stein.
Oh, I...
Oh, Karl, this lady's going to work here.
Did you want something, Karl?
Er... I... I was to...
No, it can wait.
Oh, well, if it's a professional matter, I'll leave you.
Er... No, please.
I'll come back.
Oh!
When I offered him my hand, I didn't realise.
He seemed quite taken with you.
Is he a patient?
No, he helps Dr Stein.
Oh, there's a very sound brain in that unfortunate body.
Are you quite sure you want to work here?
I'm quite sure.
I did my best to dissuade her, but it would be inconvenient if I were forced to leave the hospital because of her father.
Well, she seems a very determined young lady.
You get her to wash one of the patients.
That should frighten her away.
You ready?
Where are we going?
The laboratory.
Tonight, we give Karl his new body.
You wanted to learn. Come on!
Karl, are you ready?
I'm ready, Doctor.
Good...
Thank you.
You keep looking at him.
Very soon, that will be you.
Ready.
This is to preserve the body.
- Embalming fluid?
- Yes.
Hans.
Keep it steady at 80.
Dr Stein!
Anaesthetic!
Quick, man!
Switch off!
All right.
How long before he regains consciousness?
An hour or so.
His brain'll take some time to adjust itself to his new body.
He must have complete rest, and avoid any sudden or violent movement.
As a precaution, I shall keep him strapped for a few days.
It was a superb operation, Doctor.
I learned a great deal from it.
Thank you for your assistance.
This is only the beginning of our work together.
- Must be Otto's feeding time.
- Yes.
So it is.
That was one of Karl's duties.
I'd better do it for him.
I wonder what he makes of all this.
He'd be very interested, if he knew.
In my early experiments with a live brain,
I used reptiles.
I removed the brain from a lizard and replaced it with a frog's.
The lizard attempted to jump, but of course it was physically incapable.
But it proved my theory.
The brain will continue its normal function, regardless of its environment.
Later, I used anthropoids.
I gave Otto the brain of an orangutan.
- Was it successful?
- You can see for yourself.
Now...
I want Karl close at hand, where we can watch him.
We must get him to the hospital.
I've prepared an attic room there.
Won't that be dangerous, so soon after the operation?
Not if we take care.
Get on!
Please, be calm.
Try to relax.
You're quite safe now.
He's bound to have a certain amount of pain as the anaesthetic wears off.
Now, Karl...
Karl, can you hear me?
You've made wonderful progress in the past week.
These are necessary for a little while. I'm sorry.
It won't be for long.
- Hans?
- Yes.
Good.
Now...
Just reflect the light on his right eye, will you?
Keep it steady.
Mm-hmm.
Now, the left.
Yes, excellent.
Now, Karl, try and move your left arm.
Left.
Now, the right.
There's very little wrong with you, Karl.
Congratulations.
I'm due in the ward now.
Dr Kleve will stay with you.
- You'll see to the straps?
- Yes, of course.
Except for the movement of his right arm, his reactions are excellent.
Even better than I expected.
Now, talk to him. Don't overtax him, but keep his mind fairly active.
When he shows signs of fatigue, give him one of those.
You can leave him to rest then.
I shall go to the laboratory as soon as I've finished in the ward.
Send for me at once if you need me.
- You have your key?
- Yes.
Karl?
You'll be up and wearing those clothes in no time!
Dr Kleve?
Yes, Karl?
When can I see my new body?
Very soon now.
I think you'll be proud.
Dr Kleve, what is... to happen to me, after?
Oh, there are great plans for you.
Doctors and scientists will come from all over the world to see you, and to talk to you.
You're a very important person now, Karl.
Dr Stein intends to hold student lectures.
They'll see you, a normal man with a normal body, side by side with your old body.
All my life I've been stared at.
It will be different now, Karl.
You'll be able to play a great part in the advancement of medical science.
Oh.
- Are you in pain?
- No.
I think you'd better rest now.
Not too much excitement just yet.
Here.
Drink this.
Hello, Ned.
Still suffering, eh?
- How are you today?
- Better, miss, thank you.
Oh, good. I am glad.
Well, now. Would you care for something today?
There's some soap, writing paper, or tobacco.
Oh, well, I'll have it all in tobacco, if I may, miss.
- No soap?
- I never use it.
- Miss Conrad?
- Yes, Doctor?
I must ask you to keep out of the ward when I'm on duty.
- Have you anything to do?
- Yes, sir.
- Do it, then.
- Yes, sir.
- He's a moody cove, ain't he?
- Mmm.
I beg your pardon?
Oh, I'm sorry, miss, but, er... if you knew what I knew... Cor.
Cruel, he is.
He cuts 'em up, you know.
Alive.
Don't talk such nonsense.
What? Here, let me tell you, miss, he had a new one in the other night.
Horrible state he was in.
All strapped down, he was.
Screaming his head off.
I don't believe a word you're saying.
You can see for yourself.
They keep him in a special room, an attic.
- All locked up, of course.
- Oh!
Well, then, perhaps
I'd better see him.
Just in case you're telling the truth.
- Would you like to show me the way?
- Well, of course I will.
I know where they keep the master key.
They don't know I know, but I know a lot of things that might surprise 'em, eh?
You wait 'ere. I'll go and fetch it.
Oh, er... I might as well take my tobacco now, eh?
In case I forget it.
Ta.
Don't forget to lock 'im up when you're finished.
And let me have the key back, eh?
Oh, I'm sorry. Did I waken you?
Miss Conrad, it's you.
How did you know my name?
I've met you once before.
You wouldn't remember.
Did Dr Stein send you to see me?
No. No, I just came to see if... if you were comfortable.
Thank you.
- All right, come in.
- Thank you, Doctor.
Oh, really, I...
I didn't intend to, er...
Oh. Well, if you insist.
Here you are.
Thank you, Doctor.
Ooh, that's better.
Just the stuff for a cold day, eh?
If you used that broom a bit more, you wouldn't feel the cold.
Oh.
How's the, um... how's the special patient, Doctor, eh?
- What do you know about him?
- Oh, nothing.
Nothing at all, except he's special.
What's so different about him?
Ain't he got fleas?
If you washed yourself, you wouldn't have fleas.
What, me, wash? Cor!
I'd catch pneumonia, like as not.
No, I'll have me fleas and keep me health and strength.
What is your work?
I...
I have no work.
Oh, you will soon get some.
You'll forget all about your illness.
I will help you when you're better.
You must come and see me.
I will write down my address for you, shall I?
I'll put it in your pocket.
These straps, they hurt.
Oh, they're far too tight.
I'll loosen them for you.
Now, then.
Take the animals in the jungle.
They don't wash none, and yet they keep 'ealthy.
You never hear of them getting sick.
'Cause why?
Because they are good and dirty.
And what do you know about the animals in the jungle?
Ah, you'd be surprised.
I'm a great animal fancier.
I know all about their habits.
Because you practise them yourself, eh?
And what's wrong with that?
They was here before we was, and they'll be here a long time after we've gone.
They know how to look after themselves.
Well, take the monkeys, for instance.
They got a good layer of dirt to keep 'em warm.
Plenty to eat, plenty to drink.
I bet they laugh at us sometimes, on the quiet, eh?
Now, if you get hungry, you have to cook yourself a meal of meat and potatoes.
Not them, no.
They get hungry, they reaches out for a banana.
They don't have to worry about cooking or nothing.
They don't even eat meat.
- They don't, do they?
- Meat? 'Course they don't.
Erm... do you mind if I help myself to another one, Doctor?
No? Thanks.
Did Otto eat flesh before you operated?
No, I discovered it soon after the operation. He ate his wife.
Ate another monkey?
What else would he be married to?
Do you mean he turned into a cannibal?
Yes. I didn't attempt to correct it.
He'd been through enough already, and he's perfectly happy and in good health.
But surely...
I mean, couldn't the same thing happen to Karl?
There's no danger of that, so long as his brain is given time to heal.
Otto became agitated after his operation.
He fractured one of the cells of the brain.
Does Karl know about what happened to Otto?
Of course he does.
It's just as well.
He knows what could happen to him, so he'll take no unnecessary risks.
Hans, I finished something today.
I'd like to show it to you.
What do you think of it?
I thought you'd be interested.
Before we go back to the hospital,
I want you to help me get him into the tank.
Who's down there?
Where are yer?
Hey!
You heathen beast!
There y'are!
Afraid I'm gonna bust your skull in, are yer?
That'll teach you.
Don't hit me, please.
I won't hit you.
Now I'll have to hit you some more, to make up for all the damage you just done.
Get up!
But how...?
But he was asleep when I left him.
I gave him a sedative.
How could he have undone the straps?
Why, Hans, not how. Why.
There's always a reason why.
What happened before you gave him the sedative?
Well, I don't remember.
Pull yourself together, man!
Tell me!
Well, I... I talked to him.
I told him your plans for his future.
You told him that?
You fool! You stupid fool!
Do you know nothing of human reactions?
Let me think.
Where would he go?
The laboratory.
Look!
He burnt his old body.
The janitor must have disturbed him.
Suppose his brain was damaged in the fight?
Sooner or later he'll need my help.
He knows that.
Go back to the hospital and carry on normal routine. I shall stay here.
- But shouldn't we search for him?
- Do as I tell you!
Ah! Thank you, Joseph.
I'm just going in to see the ponies.
Hello, my lovelies.
How about a piece of sugar, hmm?
Piece of sugar for Mama?
Good!
How about you, eh?
Come on, I've got a piece for you.
Come over here.
There.
- What are you doing here?
- I... I...
I had to get away.
You said you'd help me.
Does Dr Stein know you've left the hospital?
No! No, don't tell him, please!
Please don't tell him!
- You'd better come with me.
- No, no, no, let me stay here.
You need looking after.
I must tell Dr Stein.
No!
Well, Karl...
Karl, you cannot remain here.
Not like this.
You've... you've been kind to me.
Please, please, not Dr Stein!
If I promise not to tell him, will you stay here until I get back?
I won't be long.
Try to rest this as much as you can, will you?
Yes, Doctor.
Hans, I must speak to you.
It's urgent.
Come and see me again in a few days' time.
Yes, Doctor.
Look, I found Karl this morning.
He's at my aunt's home, in the stable.
At your...
- I must get Dr Stein!
- Oh, no, no.
Please, Karl's terrified of him.
I'm sorry. I must get him.
Please. The poor man's nearly out of his mind.
Anyway, I promised him
I wouldn't bring Dr Stein.
- Then I'd better come.
- I have a carriage.
Please!
He was in pain.
I thought I was helping him.
Of course you did.
Karl, I brought Dr Kleve.
But he was there!
I left one of the groomers with him.
Joseph. Where's that man
I told you to look after?
I don't know, miss.
I went to water the horses, and when I came back, he'd gone.
- Dr Stein must be told now.
- Shall I come with you?
No, no.
You stay in the house.
Oh, stop that, can't you?
Well, what are you getting annoyed about?
What do you think
I'm getting annoyed about?
We've been 'ere half an hour, and all you can find to do is look at a lot of ants.
Well, ants is interesting.
You can learn a lot from ants.
Well, you haven't learned much.
What do you mean?
They've got more sense than to sit around all night.
They get on with it.
On with what?
Oh, I'm going home!
Good night, Gerda.
Gerda! Gerda!
Is it much further?
We're in the park now.
The Countess' house is about three miles away on the other side.
Can't we go any faster?
I feel I'm to blame for this.
But I thought it'd be wiser to go myself.
When Miss Conrad told me she'd promised...
You should have come to me at once!
These interfering women!
Why have you stopped?
Oh, it's you, Dr Stein.
I'm sorry to trouble you, sir, but we have to check on everyone passing this way.
There's been a murder in the vicinity.
Can I be of assistance?
Oh, this is Dr Kleve.
- Good evening, sir.
- Good evening.
Well, sir, if you could examine the body, we should like to have a report.
- Certainly.
- Come this way, sir.
- When did this happen?
- About an hour ago, this boy says.
Did you see who attacked her?
All he could tell me was, when he heard the girl scream, he shouted, and then the man rushed off.
If it was a man.
What do you mean?
Well, sir, the boy said he had a strange shape.
Almost like an animal.
But, of course, he only caught a glimpse of him.
I think this is more than just an ordinary murder.
Have you searched the park?
Thoroughly, sir.
Well, there's nothing I can do here.
I'll let you have my report.
Thank you, sir.
Sorry to have detained you.
I have nothing against the English composers, Dr Molke.
It's just that they won't let themselves go.
- Not even Handel?
- Ah, but he was stolen from Germany.
- Dr Victor Stein, Dr Hans Kleve.
- Oh, Dr Stein, so you came after all.
Countess, I wish to speak to your niece.
It is very urgent.
Ah, but the night is young.
Vera, my dear!
- Excuse me.
- Certainly.
When you found Karl in the stable, was he the same as when you saw him in the hospital?
Yes, but he was very distressed.
- Is that the last you saw of him?
- Yes.
- Are you certain he hasn't returned here?
- Yes. I...
Oh!
Frankenstein!
Frankenstein.
Help me.
"Frankenstein, help me!"
Those were his very words.
- And then what happened?
- The poor fellow collapsed, dead.
Stein and young Kleve carried him from the room, and that's all I know.
I summoned this meeting right away.
You did correctly, Dr Molke.
What we have to decide now, gentlemen: is this man Frankenstein or not?
Mr President, while I was waiting for the senior members of this Council to gather,
I spent my time going through the old records relating to this Frankenstein.
The description of him given in them fits our friend,
Dr Stein, very closely.
Dr Stein, I beg you to listen to me!
Get away from here, across the border!
We can start again somewhere else.
There's no hurry.
But everyone heard Karl call you Frankenstein!
Molke was there.
He'll report to the Medical Council.
They're bound to take action.
You know the way they feel about you.
This is the chance they've been waiting for.
There was always the risk that I might be identified.
- My plans were made accordingly.
- But you can't stay here!
I shall be at the surgery in the morning at my usual time.
Have you seen your waiting room?
It's deserted.
- The whole town knows who you are.
- Do they?
And I've been summoned before the
Medical Council. What am I to say?
I'll come with you.
That would be madness.
Let me do what I can.
I've nothing to fear from them.
What can they prove?
On our way, Hans,
I have something to tell you.
Gentlemen, I deny it absolutely!
You deny your name is Frankenstein?
Have you ever consulted a street directory, sir?
Any street directory for any town in central Europe?
You will find dozens of Frankensteins.
I am a Frankenstein.
Of course I'd heard of
Baron Frankenstein, who created that monster some three years ago, but naturally I didn't wish to set up in practice here handicapped by such a name, so I changed it.
But the resemblance?
The uncanny resemblance?
This is a monstrous accusation, inspired by jealousy.
Baron Frankenstein?
Dr Stein!
Dr Stein.
How do you explain that wretched fellow calling you Frankenstein?
For the very same reasons as your own, I should imagine.
I think a little proof, Mr President, rather than a lot of gossip, would be advantageous to us all.
- One moment.
- Excuse me.
I am a busy man. Good day, gentlemen.
Dr Kleve, we have not yet questioned you.
All right, open the coffin.
- It's a priest's hat!
- Rosary.
We were right.
Frankenstein is not dead.
He asked for proof.
Now we have it.
You were just like the raw material for him!
- How's the head today, Kleiner?
- Don't lay your filthy hands on me.
Don't be a fool, man.
I've got to look at it.
You heard me.
Keep your murdering hands off me,
Frankenstein.
Yes, that's what I said.
Frankenstein!
Fugitive from the gallows.
Murderer. Mutilator.
Doctor, Doctor!
They're killing him in there.
Killing him.
Killing who?
Frankenstein.
On the bed.
- Hans...
- Don't talk.
It's no good.
You know what to do.
Yes, I know.
What kind of a place is this?
I have a warrant for the arrest of Victor Stein!
Come in, Inspector.
- Where is he?
- This way.
What happened?
It was his patients at the hospital.
They went mad and practically tore him to pieces.
I brought him here and operated in the hope of saving his life.
Well, the body must be taken and buried in unhallowed ground.
As it should have been three years ago!
Pray heaven I've got the skill to do this.
You were an excellent pupil, Hans.
This scar will hardly show.
Your next patient is waiting,
Dr Franck.
Thank you.
Lady Benborough and Wendy.
How nice to see you.
SUBTITLES BY POWERHOUSE FILMS LTD
This was the planet Mars
as my crew and I first saw it.
Dangerous,
treacherous...
Alive with something we came to know only as...
Death.
This is what we faced when our spaceship
cracked up in landing just six months ago...
In January of this year, 1973.
But it seems as if six centuries passed
before a rescue ship arrived...
For today, of all my crew,
I, col. Edward carruthers
of the United States space command,
am the only one alive.
Now, I will be going back to face my superiors on earth
in Washington.
And perhaps there, too,
I will find another kind of death.
Ladies and gentlemen of the press, as you know, the first attempt to send a spaceship to the planet Mars was made 6 months ago.
We knew that that ship, the challenge 141, had reached its destination.
But that's all we knew.
Teleradio communication with Mars ceased immediately.
And we were forced to assume that the ship and crew had been lost.
The man in charge of this expedition was a man who had become known to the world as the first man to be shot into space.
The man who pioneered interplanetary space travel.
Col. Edward carruthers.
2 months ago, we sent a second ship to Mars to learn the fate of col. Carruthers and his crew.
The president has asked me to pass on to you this significant news.
Col. Edward carruthers has been found alive on Mars.
But there is a tragic side to this history-making event.
Col. Carruthers was the sole survivor of this first expedition.
1 hour ago, we received a teleradio communication from col. Van heusen, commander of the second spaceship.
This ship is now ready to take off for its return trip to the earth from Mars.
And col. Carruthers is being brought back for a court-martial to face trial for the murders of the rest of the crew.
The rescue ship is ready to return to earth.
I am to spend the next
4 months with strangers,
a crew of men and women who have
but one single purpose...
To see that I face a military firing squad.
The emergency air lock in c compartment has been left open. What gives?
Sorry, sir, that was me.
I was dumping some empty crates overboard a while ago.
Name check.
Eric royce, secure.
Mary royce, secure.
Ann Anderson, secure.
Maj. John purdue,
secure.
Bob finelli, secure.
Lt. James calder, secure.
All right! Countdown.
Minus 10, 9,
Carruthers?
Carruthers?
What are you thinking about?
Those 9 bodies you left down there?
Yes.
But I didn't kill them.
Still sticking to your story about a mysterious creature.
Do you expect a court-martial to believe it?
It's all I can tell them.
I wish we could've stayed and searched for the bodies.
However, there's still enough evidence to put you in front of a firing squad.
You honestly believe I'd murder 9 of my closest friends in order to survive on Mars?
Isn't it logical, colonel?
The challenge 141 cracks up in landing.
You know you're marooned indefinitely on Mars until another ship is sent.
If another ship is sent.
You know the food and supplies aboard would last the entire crew only a year, but they'd last you 10 years, if the others were dead.
Those people were killed by something.
Not me.
I want to show you another something, carruthers.
After you.
At least I appreciate the freedom of a ship.
Why not? Can you think of a better prison?
Aren't you afraid I'll murder you all in your sleep?
Either It. Calder or myself will be with you every second of the trip.
Take a look at this.
We brought the dental records of the first crew from earth.
This is frank kenner.
Kenner?
We found it near the challenge 141, the day after we found you.
There's only one kind of a monster that uses bullets.
The second we hit earth,
I'm gonna jump through that air lock all the way to the ground.
Then I'm gonna roll around and stretch like a cat in the sun.
Oh, boy, the sun.
We'll be 50 million miles closer to it.
Even when I was a kid, I could never stand being cold.
How'd you ever win the ardmore fellowship in low temperature physics?
I wore long underwear. Ha ha ha.
Aah. That figures.
What do you look forward to?
Girls!
Oh, you!
I think I remember, a fascinating research.
Won't a geologist do?
You're, uh, military property, Ann.
Occupied territory.
Every time van sees you, he floats, even though the ship is equipped with artificial gravity.
These days, van seems more concerned over a manhunt, than a woman hunt.
It's just that Eric believes carruthers' story, I don't.
I don't believe it, necessarily.
Nor do I disbelieve it.
However, one thing's sure:
He does believe it.
He had to force himself to believe it or he'd go insane.
And I didn't do that, did I?
Missed your dinner, col. Carruthers.
I'm tired of ruining appetites.
I'd just like a coffee, if I may, miss Anderson.
Of course, colonel.
Better stay here, carruthers.
Jimmy?
Yeah.
Here's some last-minute computations on adjusting the orbit.
Look 'em over when you get a chance.
Yes, sir.
By the time we reach earth,
I'll have his confession on tape.
Col. Carruthers!
Thank you.
Such a cold, desolate world.
We saw so little of it.
Sometimes I almost want to believe you.
I killed them or I didn't.
It was me or something.
I've only heard the story through van.
Now you'd like to hear my version?
All right.
It's a long story, but I'll make it brief.
We were all outside the ship, exploring the Southern tip of syrtis major, suddenly a sandstorm came up and we started back.
I was driving the Jeep.
The sand was so thick we could barely see.
We were almost back to the ship when...
Cartwright just disappeared.
One minute he was there and the next minute he was gone.
As if something had just plucked him out of the Jeep like... Candy out of a box.
We heard a weird sort of sound.
Then we thought we saw a dark shape running near the Jeep and started shooting at it.
A few moments later, kenner and all the rest were gone.
I was the only one who made it back to the ship.
When the sandstorm quit, I...
Went out and searched all over.
There wasn't a sign of them.
How can you explain the bullet hole in the skull?
We were all shooting at this thing...
Maybe the one who got the bullet was lucky.
You don't believe me, do you?
I don't disbelieve you.
How about you, lieutenant?
Mars is almost as big as Texas, maybe it's got monsters.
Carruthers is still talking about his monsters?
Why don't you stop baiting him, van?
You're not using your authority very well.
I'm not doing it for kicks.
Believe me, chicken.
I'm just playing the odds.
Your odds, because you think he's guilty.
Admitted.
But, Anne, there's a time factor involved here.
He's unstable right now.
If I crack his story,
I can turn him over to the court-martial tied up in a little pink ribbon.
What if he's done nothing to confess?
Then he won't.
But I owe it to the lives of those 9 men who died to try and find out.
Don't you owe it to carruthers to treat him as a fellow officer, not as an animal?
Do you think he's innocent?
I don't know.
It's not for me to decide, or for you, van.
Ok, chicken. I'll let up on the third degree.
Looks like I either have to do that or get lynched myself.
It's you I'm worried about, van.
I hate to see you so vindictive.
Every move I make's worse.
Ah, come on, Eric, resign...
No!
Aah!
I haven't resigned a game in 30 years.
I'll be damned if
I'm gonna do it now.
What was that?
What?
I heard something.
What?
I don't know.
I didn't hear anything.
I learned to hear all over again on Mars.
Who's up there?
Kienholz.
Come, colonel, we got a game to finish.
Kienholz?
Did you hear anything?
Kienholz?
Now he's hearing things.
Come on, let's get him before he wakes up the others.
Kienholz?
Carruthers?
Hey, carruthers, come on down here.
Kienholz is gone.
Kienholz isn't gone, he's probably just turned in.
I'll check his cabin.
Kienholz?
Kienholz?
He's not in his cabin.
Kienholz?
Will you stop this nonsense, currathers?
Kienholz?
Kienholz, do you hear me?
Kienholz?
Kienholz?
Kienholz, answer!
What's he hollering about?
I don't know.
He can't find kienholz.
Kienholz, this is royce.
Reply at once.
Reply at once.
Joe, can you hear me?
Reply at once.
Report at once to the quarters level.
If this is one of his jokes,
I'll make him walk home.
Everybody search the ship.
He isn't here.
Come on.
Not a sign of him.
This is ridiculous.
It's just plain crazy.
Kienholz's gotta be here.
Where's your brother?
He's Comin'.
Hey, gino.
Hey, gino!
Funny, he was right behind me.
Hey, gino!
Gino?
Gino!
Gino?
Hey, gino!
Maybe he went below.
But we were here together.
Now there's 2 of them missing.
This is ridiculous.
There's just no place on this ship for a man to hide.
Ay, gino, where are you?
Gino?
Where can he be?
If he were here, he'd hear us.
Oh, look, maybe he's hurt.
We've got to find him.
Kienholz.
Lord have mercy on his soul.
C compartment.
First storage, c compartment.
Come quick. Come quick.
All hands on the double.
What's the matter?
What happened?
What happened?
Shush!
Hey, maybe gino's up there.
No. No, he's not there.
Over here.
If he's in there, we can get him through this hatch.
I'll go, I know the layout in there.
He's in here.
Gino!
Gino!
Gino. He found gino.
Easy, Bob.
He's alive!
Gino?
Gino?
Gino?
Gino!
Gino?
Help!
You're not gonna leave gino up there.
Get him out of here!
Get my brother outta there.
Get out of here, will ya?
Get a head start. Go!
What are you gonna do with those?
We can wire 'em up to the hatches.
Let's do it!
Put up the grille. Hurry up.
There wasn't anything else to do, Bob.
I know how you feel, but there wasn't anything else we could do.
We could've tried.
You heard what Jack said.
Gino was past help...
We should've tried.
Sooner or later, he's gotta come out of the duct.
Right into the grenades.
There, you'll be all right, but you have to rest.
Jack, nobody blames you.
Do you know what happened to kienholz?
Every bone in his body must be broken.
I'm not sure that's what killed him.
That shriveled-up effect...
I'll have to do an autopsy.
What is that thing down there?
Carruthers?
What is it?
Do you know what it is, carruthers?
No.
I have a theory based on what you and Jack told me.
You say it's man-shaped, humanoid.
Perhaps there was once a civilization on Mars.
It ended. Disease, war, something terrible.
The martians that were left went back to barbarism.
Savage murderers.
Maybe that's what we've got on board.
Bob?
I was only 3 feet away from him.
He was shaking his head, trying to warn me.
I was that close and
I couldn't help him.
Instead I ran.
Why don't you hate me, too?
At least carruthers did what he thought was right.
If anybody did a wrong thing, it was me.
But please believe me, we couldn't of saved him.
Gino knew that.
Gino knew that himself.
I don't blame carruthers, you,
I don't blame anybody.
It's just that he's down there.
How could that thing have gotten aboard?
And why? Just to kill us?
What is the usual reason an intelligent creature kills.
It's hungry?
What makes you so certain it's intelligent, colonel, not just an animal?
It opened the door to c compartment.
Eric?
Those gas grenades that gino made up.
He joked about them, said if we ran into any dinosaurs on Mars, the grenades would take care of them, but... If nothing else works, maybe gas?
They're in the chemical cabinet, Eric.
We'll use them as a last resort.
Jim, will you get out the gas masks?
The second storage hatch.
Close it! Close it!
Bullets, grenades, nothing stops it.
What do we do now?
What'd you find out?
There's not a molecule of oxygen or a drop of water left in kienholz's body.
Water?
Blood, bone marrow, glandular secretion, moisture in the tissues...
Every ounce of edible fluid in his body is gone.
Probably through some osmosis process, there are no punctures.
That's what killed him.
Cellular collapse and dehydration, not being crushed into that duct.
It holds together.
Mars is a world almost totally without water or oxygen.
The creature's entire being is probably organized to feed in that manner.
It preys on smaller creatures, which in turn feed off the sand itself, converting their intake and hoarding it as water.
I'm worried about van.
Infection's set in and I can't seem to control it.
It's exploring, testing.
It can get through the center hatches.
It has to kill us or starve, and we've got to kill it or die.
Why is it so quiet now?
Why doesn't it attack?
'Cause it's got gino, huh?
Bob, look, I've got an idea.
How is he?
It's an alien bacteria of some kind.
So far the infection isn't critical, but our drugs don't even touch it.
Col. Carruthers.
I know this may sound horrible, but you were right and we were all wrong.
It's taken this to prove it.
Anne?
Anne?
It's moving around.
Jimmy?
Anne?
Bob and I have a suggestion.
We could get around behind the creature by going out the control room emergency air lock, moving down the hull to the emergency air lock on the motor level.
That would put us one level below it.
We might be able to surprise it that way.
If we knew what to surprise it with.
I've been thinking of something.
At least, it's worth a chance.
Exactly 520 minutes,
10 seconds, now.
We'll time it to get to the motor level air lock at exactly 525.
Start making noise then, not a lot, just talk, move around.
Don't make it sound threatening.
Just enough to keep his attention away in case we make noise coming in below.
Good luck, in case we don't come back.
I said, "good luck, in case we don't come back."
The plan is a simple one.
While the rest try to hold the attention of the beast
with their talk and footsteps,
we will attempt to get to a level below the monster.
Our only hope is that this will be
the last attempt we have to make to kill the thing.
I've gotta fix that pillow for van.
I'm sure they will.
They'll be all right.
I hope they're making noise.
Do you think they're gonna be all right down there?
Grenades, gas and bullets
have failed to stop the beast,
but perhaps it can be electrocuted.
There's enough voltage in these lines
to kill 30 human beings.
The only drawback is, the thing isn't human.
I know, but they'll be back up.
They'll be all right.
Ah!
Hey!
I can't make it.
My leg's broken!
Get out! Get help!
I've switched the intercom to pickup his suit-radio.
Calder? Calder, can you hear me?
Loud and clear.
It's nice to have company.
Are you all right?
I'm alive, if that's what you mean.
I picked a good spot, right between the induction pumps.
You mean it can't get at you?
It could, if I didn't have this torch.
To reach me, it has to stretch down in.
Every time it does, I give it the torch in the eyes.
Can you reach the lock?
No. No chance.
Looks like I'm here for the duration.
Oops! Here it comes again.
Calder?
Still here.
The plate on this torch says,
"good for three hours continuous use."
And to return it for your money back if unsatisfied.
Hang on, Jim.
We'll leave the intercom on.
Just hang on.
Sure. What else?
Will you keep us informed of its movements... we'll try to figure how to get you out.
Just send care packages.
You know, if that thing should attack the induction pumps or...
The bank of control relays, we couldn't maneuver the ship or land it. we'd just...
Drift right past earth towards interstellar space. We'd...
Drift forever.
So I decided after one bad marriage to bury myself in science.
I didn't want anybody.
Van changed your mind?
If we get out of this, I'd...
Eric?
The bacteria is attacking the bone marrow, resulting in a leukemia condition.
I can fight it with drugs, but slowly.
Too slowly.
If they're going to live, they've got to have fresh blood constantly...
And there's no more up here in the dispensary.
Then we've got to go down and get it.
Sir, if...
You couldn't help calder.
You had to...
You had to leave him there.
Well...
What did you do, carruthers?
Throw him in as bait so you could get away?
Van.
How...
How come you...
How come you always get away without a scratch?
He doesn't know what he's saying.
I heard that.
Tell him he's nuts.
Van heusen's got it all wrong.
Hey, can anybody hear me?
Van heusen's got it all wrong.
We hear you, Jim. Thanks.
Somehow we've got to get that blood.
Well, this time it's my turn.
I'm going with you.
All right, we'll make a run for it.
One thing, remember there's only
10 feet of ladder between it and us when we get down there.
So, we better take it slow and easy.
One sound, and we're dead.
Let's take our boots off, huh.
Here are the inventory numbers.
Type o, compartment x-1, storage b.
They're all marked.
Calder?
I'm with it.
I'll let out a shout if the critter even looks at the ladder.
Right now, it's just prowlin' around.
Good luck.
Thanks.
Hey, this might be worth something.
It just went in the reactor room.
This might be the break we're waiting for.
It took gino with him.
Calder, listen,
I'm going to close the door to the reactor room.
Let me know what he does, will ya?
Roger.
Calder?
What's happening?
Nothing. Not a squawk.
We're Comin' down.
Eric?
Van'll appreciate it. Come back.
Maybe we can get calder out of there now.
Bob...
Take a look.
We'd better hurry and get that blood.
Easy, Bob, easy. No noise!
Okay, Jimmy.
No! Van, no!
No! Let me go!
Let me go!
Let go of me. Van...
I know what I'm doing.
Please, van.
We can unshield the reactor.
The radiation...
The radiation will kill it.
It's too dangerous while they're down there.
If the creature breaks loose he'll...
Wait until they come back.
It's a good idea, but, van, please.
Now is the time.
No, van, please.
Hurry! Van unshielded the reactor.
I hope that door holds if it wants out.
Bob, hurry up.
It's enough to kill 100 men.
Get up the stairs.
I'll be all right.
No, I'm not leaving ya.
Ah! Ah!
It's out!
It's out!
It won't die.
Eric, hurry. Hurry!
What about Bob?
There's nothing we can do!
Get that blood up there fast! Don't stop!
Eric.
Get up to the control level. Hurry!
Be careful, dear.
At least down below
I could've died on a mattress.
You'll be all right.
You'll be all right.
I guess it...
I guess it looks like it's you and ed now, huh, chicken?
What do you mean?
Uh...
I got good ears. I can hear.
You and him, just out of nowhere.
Let's talk about it later.
There isn't any later, the way things look.
That's why I asked now...
I, i...
I just got to know.
Van, please.
Anne, where are the flashlights?
Better get Goin'.
Mary?
Am I going to make it? I mean, if all of us get away, uh...
Okay, Mary, I understand.
I'm the guy with all the answers.
There is nothing to do but wait now,
nothing to do but see if the beast
will reach us through the center hatch.
We can go no higher.
We are in the top level of the ship.
This is where either we die, or it dies.
Calder?
Still alive.
Don't ask me why I bother.
Good. Can you see it?
Big as death.
It's been sitting here for the last half hour, licking its chops.
Incidently if anybody's interested at this late date
I got it figured how the critter got aboard.
How?
It Must've followed us back to the ship, after we picked you up, climbed one of the fins
just before takeoff and got in through
the open emergency hatch in c compartment.
Sounds right.
How's the air down there?
Pretty bad.
My suit-tank helps, but it's about empty.
Ed?
It's movin'.
It's going up the ladder.
I can hear it prowlin' around up there.
Anne, Mary, get those flashlights on quick.
Ed, it's going up to first storage,
banging on everything it passes.
It's Goin' nuts.
Can you get to the air lock?
Why? Look at the pretty stars through my broken faceplate.
Get in the air lock and hide there.
Eric.
Take a look at this.
The oxygen consumption's way up.
40 percent over every previous maximum.
40 percent! Perhaps the gas from the grenades.
No, that wouldn't affect it that much.
It's not a leak, the pressure's all right.
Are you thinking the same thing I'm thinking?
The creature?
It must have enormous lungs from the thin air on Mars.
Let all the air out of the ship.
If we can do it in time, we can kill it.
We can build up our air supply later.
Right!
Get your spacesuits on. Quick!
Aah!
Drive him below so I can get to the air lock.
Ed!
You have been called here again to receive further information about the story which was given to you last night.
I will read you the text of a teleradio message received from the challenge 142 less than an hour ago.
"This is Eric royce talking.
"Of the 19 men and women who have set foot upon the planet Mars,
6 will return.
"There is no longer a question of murder,
"but of an alien and elemental life force.
"A planet so cruel, so hostile, that man may find it necessary
"to bypass it in his endeavor
"to explore and understand the universe.
"Another name for Mars is death."

This is a sacred pyramid, in the dead city of Tikal,
300 miles south of Mexico City.
Here, for thousands of years,
once lived the Maya,
a peaceful and cultured people
deeply versed in mathematics and astronomy.
But one day, in the year 607AD,
this people emigrated en masse,
toward the distant and savage north,
abandoning intact the solid houses, the pyramids
and temples they had constructed.
Not a single Maya came back,
the city remained deserted,
and slowly the jungle swallowed their streets and buildings
erasing all trace of that civilisation.
The scientific expeditions that had attempted to throw light upon the reasons for this migration
have never been able to give it an acceptable explanation.
It was once thought that they had been defeated by an enemy tribe,
but what power at that time could have been strong enough to defeat the Mayan people?
There exists no indication of any cataclysm of nature, and what catastrophe
could have pushed an entire people to build a new kingdom
abandoning the lands in which they had always lived?
The mystery still persists today
and the nomad indians who cross the area
recount how their ancestors fled this land in order to escape the wrath of a terrible goddess
a goddess who thirsted for blood:
Caltiki!
Look! Señor Nieto!
What's happened?
My God!
And Ulmer, what could have become of him?
Who knows?
So what happened? Were they attacked?
Only Nieto might be able to tell us but at the moment he's in a state of shock.
He won't be able to talk for many hours yet.
It's empty. He fired all his shots.
- But who could have attacked them?
- They went into the cave, near the volcano.
That's an absolutely deserted area.
What could have happened?
Perhaps it was Nieto, who clobbered Ulmer.
That's absurd. Ulmer and Nieto are like two brothers.
I can already see the headlines:
"Two archaeologists fight to the death in a cave in Tikal, Mexico."
Stop it, Bob!
We must go back to the cave, immediately.
Ulmer may be wounded and waiting for help.
Ulmer!
The mummy - aah it's Caltiki! Caltiki!
Caltiki is a Mayan divinity!
Let's go, John!
Yes, let's go.
I'll tell Ellen to look after him.
Come on! The truck will meet us at the cave.
Do you think they'll find him?
I don't know. I fear something horrible's happened.
That's how the indians feel about it too. They're all terrified.
Do you know what they say, that we should never have come here?
That we've provoked evil spirits.
I'm afraid it'll end up with them abandoning us if we don't go soon.
I'll tell John when he gets back, but I know how useless it is.
And Nieto - how is he?
He's still raving.
He keeps repeating the same name..
Caltiki.
Yes, Caltiki
Then he brings up Ulmer. It's really scary.
Do you hear him? It's better if we stick around.
We've already looked everywhere.
Where could he have ended up?
It's a script in Mayan characters.
The ground's given way here.
There's an opening.
It must have been opened during the eruption the other day.
Come here!
Look!
There are steps. They must have come this way.
Give me the Geiger counter!
They're remnants of an ancient construction.
Do you fear there might be radiation?
I don't think so, although it's best to check that.
Come on, hurry up with that gadget!
But that's the goddess Caltiki!
We must be in a subterranean Mayan temple. A great discovery.
Caltiki, but that's the name Nieto kept repeating in his delirium.
So it's certain that they've been here.
One moment.
Look at the dial.
It's indicating strong radioactivity.
Say it came from there, from something under the water..
This must be a sacred lake, where the priests, drowned the victims as sacrifices to the goddess.
But if only I had my underwater equipment..
Maybe Ulmer fell in there.
But this is his cine-camera!
-Let me see.
-There's no doubt.
It's really his.
He must have dropped it.
In fact, the shutter's bent.
We need to explore the bottom of the lake.
We must go back to camp and equip ourselves to get ready for a dive.
Before giving up the search, you have to try everything.
Let's go.
How is Nieto?
Well, worse. The fever's mounting, it's getting worrying.
We have to do everything to save him.
Bob has developed the film Ulmer took.
Maybe we'll understand what happened.
Oh, yes, we could. Get ready to project it right away.
OK.
- Can we begin?
- Yes, certainly.
Go ahead.
Who recorded this?
The indian who took them to the mouth of the cave.
Did you question him?
Yes, but he knows nothing.
He left them there and then came back.
Poor Ulmer! Who knows where he could have ended up?
Look at that! The eruption was still taking place.
There's the stair we discovered this morning.
Ulmer shot this part.
Look, that one down there is the goddess Caltiki.
What's he found?
It would seem like a bracelet.
- What's happening?
- Who knows?
Something's happened to Ulmer. They're in danger, they've been attacked!
Isn't there any more?
That's all.
These people are driving me crazy! I shouldn't ever have come here.
This trip was supposed to be a second honeymoon for us.
How could I foresee all this?
It was your idea to persuade me to come away.
But then, for you, work comes first of all!
But I can't stand it any longer.
I'm going back to Mexico City tomorrow, whatever.
Do whatever you want to. I won't force you to stay around, even if you're my wife!
Although I expected my wife to give me more understanding.
Since we're here you don't even remember I exist!
I have responsibilities, I'm obliged.
Without even considering that today we made a very important discovery.
An important discovery?
One man's dead and another one's dying!
That's exactly why we must continue. So that they won't have died for nothing.
What the devil are the natives doing this evening?
An ancient rite.
To placate the anger of evil spirits.
A sacred dance? Let's go and see.
No, I'm not interested.
- No, wait!
- But why? What is it?
A white can't participate in the ritual.
It would bring bad fortune.
Not to me! Ha ha!
Helen, I'm very sorry for what's happening to you.
What does that mean?
Oh, excuse me..
I heard everything John said to you.
I think that he behaved very badly.
I thought you were a friend of John's.
Yes of course.
But I want the best for you too, I'd like to see you happy.
A woman can't live this way.
You're.. a very sensitive creature.
You need warmth, and affection.
I believe that you've set too much store by our discussion.
It could be.
But I hope one day you'll take refuge between my arms.
Don't delude yourself, Max. Goodnight.
You haven't had much success.
Stop spying on me.
Is this how you set out to conquer that poor millionairess doll.
Poor Max, you're aiming too high.
And you do just the same.
I'm no longer able to free myself from you since I pulled you out of that third-rate joint!
You have no right to treat me like this!
You used to promise me..
Men promise any old thing to someone like you.
And then? I'm not sure I was the first.
It's true! I've never hidden my past from you.
But don't get rid of me so easily!
I don't want to lose you, Max.
Are you trying to tell me you're looking for a husband?
Hmph, take me off the list!
Find yourself a half-breed, someone like you.
Yes, dear?
Would you forgive me?
You forgive me.
Both of us have our nerves in shreds. Unfortunately.
But they say a good argument now and then guarantees a happy marriage.
Excuse me, treasure, it's all been my fault.
I'm capricious, it's true, you knew that before you married me.
And me,
I concern myself more with biology than with my wife.
But I'll change, you'll see.
Tomorrow we have to get back to research.
But I want you and Linda to return to Mexico City, first thing in the morning.
Do you really want that, John?
Yes dear, I'd prefer it.
- Pass the tank.
- Have you checked it?
Yes, all ready.
I don't like that lady!
But for luck, I've protected myself.
Be careful.
Up.
There's a treasure at the bottom of the lake, a fabulous treasure!
We're all rich, billionaires!
They're jewellery of the Pre-Columbian style.
They'd have adorned the victims offered to the goddess.
Who knows how many people are dead in there, all covered in gold and jewels?
And Ulmer?
Not a trace of him.
Maybe it's better if I go down again, have another look round.
No, it's pointless. I don't want to take any more risks.
But who thinks of risks when all this bounty is there on the bottom?
Bob is right.
Well, try to be quick.
I can't wait to get out of this cavern.
OK.
Let's go.
I don't want him to stay too long.
Let's get him up! Something's happened!
Come on, you pull too!
Pull!
Go easy.. slow now..
Come on!
Look! Look out Señor!
Save yourselves if you can!
Quick! Up the stairs!
John! We've left the bag with the jewels!
Wait for me.
No! Max, it's crazy!
Max, come back, don't be a fool!
Get up, Max.
We're safe. We made it.
Hey you, come over here quickly! Carry him away!
Don't touch his arm, it's dangerous.
If you'd waited just one hour longer there wouldn't have been anything we could do for him.
Luckily we were able to charter a plane to carry him.
This case has no precedent in the history of medicine.
This unknown substance has incorporated itself in the tissues of his arm and absorbed all vital fluids.
In your opinion, is there still hope of saving Max?
I hope so. But you, a qualified biologist, must also help us by determining what could be the nature of this monstrous thing.
What you tell me is seems fantastic.
But your hypothesis is correct, it's extraordinary!
You observe it too, Profesor Fielding!
I tell you again that this is not a known organism, but a fragment of an animal constituted of a single gigantic cell.
Quite so, but do you realise the audacity of your claim?
There would be a revolution in the field of biology, with the discovery of such a unicellular being.
What's strange is, why an organism of this type would need millennia to develop this way.
Can we establish it's age?
- Yes, certainly. Come with me.
- Thank you.
This apparatus is the fruit of 20 years of research.
It's an electric brain that, using an isotope, carbon-14, reveals the age of any body, also living.
In a few seconds we'll know in exactly which era the fragment came into being.
It's amazing!
You check the readings too, please.
No, it's not possible!
It's never gone as high as this with a living specimen!
But.. Professor!
15 megavolts - how incredible!
There can't be any mistake.
This fragment, this specimen.. this cell, must be 20 million years old!
Gentlemen, our expedition had one purpose: to throw some light on the reasons for the occurrence in the 7th century of the great migration of the Mayan people.
During the research, unfortunately in consequence of grave incidents, we have discovered the mysterious being that the newspapers are talking about.
And of which, we have recovered a fragment.
Maybe the journalists have exaggerated their deductions, but everything makes us think we are confronted with a living prehistoric being that goes back to the first geological eras.
But this, gentlemen, is not all.
I want to call your attention to a Mayan inscription photographed at Tikal.
It reads:
"Caltiki is one, and immortal."
"And when her mate appears in the sky, the power of Caltiki"
"will destroy the world."
This description coincides strangely with the characteristics of our mysterious specimen.
Caltiki is one, the being is a unicellular one.
Caltiki is immortal. This specimen is of an age inconceivable to us.
If I could renounce scientific rigour, I would tell you, 
I brought back with me a piece of the body of Caltiki.
Run to Papa.
Welcome back, dear.
Oh my treasure! Tell me, were you good today?
Yes. Mamma gave me a teddy bear.
Is that so? Aren't you going to show me?
Now, no.
He's sleeping now, because he got tired.
No, no, don't touch the bag.
- Go to Mamma.
- Come on, Jenny, time to go to sleep.
To bed with your teddy.
Listen, don't let Jenny into my laboratory.
- Why?
- Please, dear..
She's not to enter for any reason.
Go with your nanny.
- 'Bye, little Mamma.
- 'Bye, dear.
What's that there?
It's the piece of the monster that the professor managed to detach from Max's arm.
Why do you keep it? Wouldn't it be better to destroy it?
I have to keep it under observation.
We've analysed it but we still know too little about it.
What's made it live an incalculable number of years?
What guides it infallibly towards the organisms from which it sucks life.
If I could only manage to resolve those two questions, I might be able to say something new in biology.
How is Max now?
Very bad.
His life depends on the results of my study.
The only hope of saving him.
Unfortunately it's a tenuous hope.
Linda, you mustn't make yourself ill. There's never need to despair.
He's regained consciousness.
But he's so strange!
Sometimes he screams with pain.
Then he turns, looks at me, and laughs.
And his arm! My God, his arm! What a horrible thing!
But you now, you need to rest a little.
Yes, thank you.
Come to stay with us until Max gets better.
Hi, Max.
You've really had a close call!
How is Nieto?
Oh he's better. Much better.
He's back on his feet already, some day soon he'll come back to work.
What a lousy liar you are.
He's dead, right?
Yes.
But you're not going to die, Max.
You'll manage to pull through.
Have you seen my arm? My face?
Should I delude myself?
Max, you must have faith. You'll see, we'll do the impossible.
Oh, sure!
Sure, you'll use me as a guinea pig, and I'll die like the others!
What madness to go back into that cave!
You'll see, we'll pay dearly for this! All of us!
All of us!
Now you stay calm and drink this, it'll do you good.
No! I don't want to!
So, professor..
The outcome of the diagnosis..?
We're confronted with a serious lack of knowledge, Mr Fielding.
And the best actually available medical treatments are decidedly insufficient..
The diagnosis is difficult, unfortunately.
Why?
Because it seems a third-degree burn, but the tissues are like parchment.
But the skin..! The skin, one might say, has been..
- Mummified?
- Yes, exactly, mummified.
Exactly like that.
And the process has been very quick.
It seems an incredible story.
Yes, you're right, professor.
I wouldn't believe it myself if I hadn't seen it personally.
- Ah, but there's worse.
- What?
The poison will certainly enter the blood circulation, and unfortunately..
Unfortunately?
Unfortunately we must anticipate that before long it will reach the brain.
Miss Agatha, tell Professor Perez that the operating room is free.
"If we accept the hypothesis that, millions of years ago, a primordial cell"
"could have developed differently from all the others.."
"The amoebas had a similar structure to the being in the cave."
"Primitive monocellular beings developed by combining with others just like them."
"But this cell might have grown, becoming gigantic, without combining with any other."
"But what natural biological force could have caused"
"this abnormal development?"
Oh, it's you Ellen.
John dear, it's late.
What time is it?
It's almost one. Don't you think you should get some rest?
No, it's not the moment.
You see, I feel I'm on the right path, but the real substance of this being keeps eluding me.
What is it that's concerning you?
I must continue the analysis of the material of which it's formed, to discover the reason why it destroys every organism it comes in contact with.
I'll find a cure for Max's condition.
I can't abandon him.
Today the professor told me there's a risk he's going mad.
I've got to find out why.
It would be absurd to give up.
So, you intend to work all night?
Yes, dear.
Do you understand how I want the best for you?
All this is too important for me.
I must manage.
Good luck with your work, dear.
But perhaps..
Why not?
It could be this..
There's been a strong eruption, and you know that the whole area is naturally volcanic.
In the cave, we uncovered gamma radiation.
Maybe that's the source of energy for that being.
Radioactivity!
But we can't be sure till we scrutinise it under electronic bombardment.
Will you have the betatron put at my disposal, please?
I'll organise it with the institute. You'll have it this evening.
Thank you. I'm counting on you, professor. It's of the utmost urgency.
Are you ready?
If the conclusions we've drawn are correct, then surely, under the effect of the radioactivity, that little fragment ought to show signs of life.
All right, start it up.
The generator's started, professor.
Radioactivity zero six rad.
Zero seven rad.
Zero eight rad.
Stop it, right away.
Generator reports zero, professor.
On the cessation of radioactivity, it will enter an apparent lethargy.
But underneath it's intensely charged. I believe..
..it could develop more, and multiply itself.
Linda?
Yes, dear?
How considerate you are.
Everybody's so nice to me.
They're trying to help you.
Oh, I believe that!
Now they're afraid.
They realise what I'm worth, and they also realise that they've..
They've finished exploiting me, earning money from my work!
Because now it's different.
Now they must settle accounts with me.
Also that woman.
That woman that would be allowed to scorn me.
Don't think about her, it's me who's here with you.
She'll be sorry she treated me that way!
They'll all pay, you'll see!
I've been wounded, I've suffered, but now I'm strong..
I'm stronger than all of you!
You'd do better to side with me.
Remember that well!
Linda, how are you?
My God, you're exhausted!
Would you like a coffee?
No, thanks. Don't worry about me. It isn't worth it.
You shouldn't torment yourself like that, otherwise it'll end up with you ill too!
Today Max said very strange things to me. He made me frightened.
Well, in his condition it's easy to exaggerate.
It's up to you to give him courage.
It's useless, he won't listen to me.
He hates me.
He's ashamed of me because I'm.. a halfbreed.
Also, he's in love with you!
Why that's absurd.
I heard him that night at the camp. He was courting you.
And it doesn't surprise me, you've got everything I haven't.
You're a lady, you're rich. And you're also beautiful.
Max behaved with me like he does with everybody.
Excuse me if I'm blunt, but he's not the man for you.
He doesn't deserve you, you should leave him.
Leave him! How can I leave him in that state he's in?
One day he'll get well, and you'll be free. Free and happy.
Happy? My happiness is with him.
I know perfectly well what he's worth, but I love him.
I can face everything with him.
Everything! As long as I don't lose him.
Yes? That's me. No, my husband isn't here.
Then madam, you come. Come here immediately, to the hospital.
It's about Max Gunther.
Excuse me, but what's happened? A disgrace?
Ellen, what is it, Max? Has something happened?
Don't worry, we'll come immediately.
Was that the hospital?
Yes, they want us there right away, but they didn't explain the reason.
- Please, madam, stay calm.
- What's happened, doctor?
- Stay calm. Please don't do this!
- Where's Max?
Max - where is he? Where's Max?
I don't know. We've searched everywhere.
Be brave, Linda.
- Who is that woman?
- The wife of Gunther, I believe.
Send the alarm out to all the street patrols.
We're looking for a man, 33 years, of medium height, blond hair and blue eyes. He's wounded..?
In the right arm.
In the right arm. Dangerous.
Dolores, come into the house to help me.
What are you thinking?
The inscription said: "Caltiki is one, and immortal."
And these words contain a scientific truth.
But who's going to be her husband coming from the sky?
That which, according to the inscription, will give Caltiki infinite force, with which she'll destroy the world.
Don't you think we're giving too much credit to the scientific mind of the Maya?
Well, who knows?
It could be that they knew more than us.
- Are you still immersed in your research?
- Hi, dear.
Now we've abandoned that, we're reduced to solving puzzles.
We're looking for a bridegroom.
Is he so difficult to find?
Ah, it seems he comes from the sky.
Well, whatever you find, I hope you find it soon.
For a week, now, you've kidnapped my husband.
I'm truly mortified, but I can't do without his help.
Good night.
Good night.
So we'll see each other tomorrow, eh?
Till tomorrow.
Excuse me, dear.
Hello? Yes, it's me, Fielding.
Who is it, John?
What? Are you sure?
It invaded the laboratory and destroyed the betatron.
It's still growing! We don't know how to stop it.
Come immediately!
Set fire to it.
Set fire to the whole lab, if necessary, without losing a moment. I'll come immediately.
- I have to run.
- But John..
The husband coming from the sky.
What's that about, professor?
I don't know, but I want to have another try.
You wish to know if, in the year 607AD, a celestial phenomenon occurred?
-Right.
-Strange you should ask..
What interests me is that, it was the year of the Mayan emigration.
There was the passage of a comet.
It was seen at Byzantium, by an astronomer of the Emperor Justinian.
The ancients named it Arsinoé,
They defined it as a malign star, because it precipitated grave perturbations like those of a radioactive cloud.
But then, this would cause an increase in atmospheric radioactivity!
Naturally, we don't have precise data about it. But I'll be able to give you that tomorrow.
- Why tomorrow?
- Because tonight the earth is in exactly the same condition as in the year 607.
In a few hours that comet will pass very close to us.
Like, the same comet, tonight?
Certainly, that's why I found your request so curious.
Arsinoé comes near to us, cyclically, every 1352 years.
We're observing it at this moment.
Arsinoé.. "the husband from the sky".
That's the cause of the Mayan emigration.
Radioactivity increased the size and strength of the monster.
The zone around the cavern was infested with terrifying beings, that thirsted for blood.
It's the same danger that also threatens us now.
The radioactivity will make the fragments of the monster grow.
Operator!
Professor Fielding's line.
- He doesn't answer.
- Try, try again!
Miss, I absolutely need to talk!
3679 is completely cut off.
There's no time to lose. I must go to Fielding's house.
You, run to the betatron! We need to destroy the monster fragments immediately!
When we arrived, the betatron was in pieces and the watchman was dead.
A new victim, like Bob and the others.
Maybe he inadvertently started up the generator, causing the growth of the monster.
But we'll never know.
See that no-one touches him, for any reason.
It could be dangerous.
The amazing thing is how quickly the size of the fragment developed.
Another few minutes and I don't know what could have happened.
Inform the family.
When the husband appears in the sky, the power of Caltiki will destroy the world!
Mama! Little Mama!
Mama!
What is it, treasure, why aren't you asleep?
I saw a man. A bad man.
Jenny, there's no bad man here. You don't need to be afraid.
But I saw him!
You were dreaming, love. Now lie down and close your eyes.
Mama will stay with you until you're asleep.
All right? Sleep, treasure.
Have a lovely, lovely sleepy-bye.
I'm sorry, I didn't want to wake you Ellen.
I didn't manage to sleep, and I was hungry.
We're all nervous. The child just woke up too, crying that she'd seen a man.
It'll have been a nightmare.
Oh yes, no doubt. Good night.
Good night.
Max, I've brought you something to eat.
Did they see you?
No, you can feel safe. No-one knows that you're here.
Max, you have to listen to me.
Start again.
I love you. And you know that. But you can't stay here.
What, do you want to turn me in?
No, Max, I'd never betray you.
And John is your friend too.
John - he would be the first to denounce me.
You're wrong! You don't know how much he's done for you.
Now, maybe you don't understand that, but when you're normal again..
How am I not normal? Even you think I'm crazy!
Just remember, if you say one word, I'll kill you!
Ah here you are. Professor Rodriguez has gone to your house.
He did? Why?
We tried to telephone but you're phone's cut off.
- We got alarming news at the observatory.
- What's it about?
Right at this moment a comet's passing very close to the Earth.
It causes an increase in atmospheric radioactivity.
It's already reached zero eight rad.
My God!
That fragment at my house!
Get the police! The army! We need flamethrowers.
That monster can only be destroyed with fire!
Don't run away, it's useless.
No, Max. Don't do this. I thought you were my friend.
How beautiful you are.
Oh, how inappropriate!
You did a terrible thing leaving the hospital before you got better.
After all the trouble we've taken for you!
But why to you try to escape from me, Ellen? Do I disgust you?
No, calm down.
Listen, now I'll call Linda. You'll see - she'll be happy to see you again.
She's already seen me. And she helped me, and hid me.
But now I don't need her any more.
What do I care about her?
You're the only woman that I want, Ellen.
And you'll be mine!
Now you'll come away with me.
The telephone's not working. I pulled the line out.
Nobody can come to help you. You're in my power!
No! Let me go! Let me go!
Help! Linda! Linda!
Max, you promised me not to come here.
You walk away!
Give me that pistol right now. I won't let you hurt her!
Stay where you are!
No, Max, no!
Murderer!
Now you'll do whatever I want!
Obey me, or I'll kill your little girl too!
John Fielding!
I've heard you!
Come out!
Help!
Mama!
- Mama, what is it?
- Nothing!
Come on. Come on.
Halt! Stop!
Running a roadblock, resisting the public forces..
If it goes well you'll get three months, Señor.
Listen to me, inspector.
I'm Professor John Fielding, British citizen.
I beg you to let me go immediately. My wife and daughter are in danger.
I don't doubt that, with a husband like you!
Listen, inspector, there are monstrous beings in the house that nobody's seen before now.
It's impossible to explain now, but believe me they're dangerous.
And not only for my family, for the entire city!
Come on, take him away immediately, this crazy person!
Inspector you must listen to me!
Take him away. And if he acts up again, put him in a cell!
Let me go!
Call the British Embassy! Do something or you'll regret it!
For the love of God, open up I tell you!
Follow him!
Stop! Stop!
There! Over there!
Take him!
Take the Jeep!
- Where are you taking me, Mama?
- Be good, Jenny, be good!
- Mama, where's Papa?
- He's coming now.
Attention! Attention!
Commander of the Armed Forces speaking.
The city is in a state of emergency.
No one approach the south quarter.
Armed vehicles of the military, and flamethrower squads,
have received the order to move to the house of Professor Fielding.
Clear the roads for the passage of military vehicles.
No-one may leave their homes until further orders.
The population is invited to keep calm,
and all measures have been taken to deal with the danger
that faces the city.
Help, John, we're here!
Be brave, wait!
John, help us!
Everybody, go!
Stop shooting, it's useless! We need flame throwers!
And you?
Inspector, that Englishman was right, really! The garden is full of monsters!
I know. The alarm has already been raised.
The army will be here in a few minutes. Recall all our men.
Tell them to stay out of the garden, we have to wait for the flamethrowers. Go!
- Yes, sir!
- Let's go.
Everybody out!
Surround the house!
Get back men. We're letting go with the flamethrowers.
Quick!
Advance!
- Look! There's a way through!
- But where?
Let me go!
He's crazy! He'll be burned alive!
Cease firing!
Here I am Ellen!
Be quick!
It's breaking through the door!
Hurry!
Go on, give me the child.
Daddy!
Come quickly. Quickly!
Hold on to me tightly!
They're safe!
Start firing again.
Look, it's enormous!
Get back, everybody, get back!
The city's in danger! Get the tanks in to destroy everything!
Attention! Advance from the north. Break down the perimeter wall.
Group 2, advance across the garden.
Group 3 and group 4 ready for action.
Group 5, don't shoot! Use your flamethrowers.
Order the tanks to use flamethrowers!
To all tanks: open fire!
From the commander of the operation: the danger is over.
We're securing the area.
You can suspend the state of emergency.
The companies are returning to base.
Jenny's gone to sleep.
Please, take us away from here.
Yes, now we can go.
Now there's nothing to be afraid of, dear.
Caltiki is destroyed forever.
Subs by beastless 2012
Here passes from this Earth
Hélène Delambre,
...widow of my brother André,
...whom I loved deeply, hopelessly.
She was destroyed in the end by dreadful memories:
A recollection of horrors that did not dim as the years went on,
...but instead grew monstrously, and left her mind shocked and unsteady...
...so that death, when it came, was a blessed release.
Beg pardon, gentlemen.
May I speak to you?
No, you may not.
You're Philippe
Delambre, aren't you?
My condolences on the death of your mother.
Would you please get out of our way?
I beg your pardon sir,
I am an accredited freelance journalist.
You are an accredited, freelance scandalmonger!
Now will you please leave us alone?
Why don't you want me to speak to your nephew, Mr. Delambre?
Is it because there are a lot of unanswered questions...
...about the death of your brother?
All very mysterious.
First it was called murder.
Then it was called suicide.
First Hélène Delambre was held.
Then she was released. All very odd!
Granville, will you get out of here.
And I advise you to never try these tactics again.
Inspector Beauchamp! You were part of that big cover-up, weren't you?
This is going to make nice reading, I promise you.
Thank you, Inspector Beauchamp.
The newspapers can be unpleasantly persistent.
You must understand their eagerness to uncover a mystery, Mr. Delambre.
Yes. You and Inspector Charas were very kind.
- I only aided Charas. It was his case.
- No.
No, you were invaluable, too.
I shall never forget that.
You had a great deal to bear, monsieur.
If I can be of any help, please call on me.
Thank you.
That man's a disgrace to all decent journalists, intruding at such a time.
Nevertheless, he asked a question.
Why was Mother accused?
- I can't tell you.
- You've got to.
All my life I've heard whispers.
I know something terrible happened, something even more terrible than...
...suicide or murder.
What was it?
François...
Anything is better than not knowing.
If I tell you, Philippe,
...it will haunt you for the rest of your life.
Tell me. I have a right to know.
Take us to Delambre Freres, please.
The old foundry.
- Monsieur Delambre!
- Gaston.
Philippe! I beg of you, please, do not enter here.
This place is cursed and
I swear to you it is!
Ever since... ever since the day
André Delambre began to work in it.
It is I who... who found his poor, crushed body.
Believe me, I know... I know.
Please. Please, I beg of you.
Do not go in.
OK, Gaston. All right.
Thank you for warning us.
Now, we won't be long. Go about your work.
Poor old fellow.
It disturbs him when anyone comes here.
He remembers too much.
This laboratory has been locked since the day André died.
It's just as he left it.
The equipment... It's all smashed.
Yes, he did it - in a blind rage, to destroy the machine he created,
...because it destroyed him.
It destroyed him and your mother...
...because he ventured into areas of knowledge where man is not meant to go.
That's pure superstition!
There are no areas of knowledge where man is not meant to go.
Fifty years ago, stupid people said man was not meant to fly.
Father did research in the transmission of molecular structures. I know that.
- Just tell me what happened.
- Very well, Philippe. I will tell you.
Yes, it's true. André did do research in the transmission of matter.
The device you see lying shattered there was built to prove his theory:
That solid three-dimensional molecular structures...
...can be transmitted instantaneously through space,
...much in the same way as a television image is.
But a television image is merely an electronic representation...
...of light and shadow.
André's machine actually disintegrated the molecules of solid matter,
...and then reintegrated them again in a different place.
Eventually, André gained such confidence in his machine...
...that he put himself through the disintegration-integration process.
He successfully transmitted himself.
Then, on a tragic second attempt,
...something went wrong.
Unwittingly, he found himself in the disintegrator chamber,
...but he was not alone.
With him was a fly.
The result was a creature with the body of André Delambre,
...and the arm and the head...
...of a fly.
And so André decided to dispose of himself in such a way...
...as to keep such an abomination from the eyes of the world.
With your mother's help, he crushed his monstrous head and arm...
...in one of the presses out there in the old foundry.
Now you know why I didn't want to tell you,
...and now you know, Philippe,
...why we got to get out of here and lock this place up...
...and never come back again!
- François?
- Yes?
Do you remember what you told me after my father's death?
Yes, I think so.
You said he was like an explorer in a wild country...
...where no man had ever been before.
That he was searching for a great truth.
He almost found it, but for one instant he was careless.
- Yes, Philippe, I remember that.
- Do you remember what I asked you then?
Yes. You said you wanted to be an explorer like your father.
- And you asked me to help you.
- Will you help me?
Haven't I done so?
The finest scientific education...
No, I said I wanted to be an explorer like my father.
I've read his scientific papers.
I understand what he was trying to do.
I've done some work in the field myself.
I want to rebuild this.
It'll be his monument, his vindication.
Philippe... It destroyed him.
It could destroy you.
He was careless. I won't be.
- No, Philippe!
- You'd break your promise?
- It was the promise to a child.
- It was a promise to me.
- Philippe, I'm sorry, I can't help you.
- Why not? Give me one reason...
...besides your touching concern for my safety.
All right I'll give you one reason: Money.
I simply can't afford to back you in this venture.
Neither can the business.
That's the plain, unpleasant truth of the matter.
All right, François.
I don't believe you, but I won't argue the point.
- Then you'll give up the idea?
- Of course not.
- Philippe, look...
- I'll never give it up.
While Mother was alive, she was so obsessed...
...with fears that I couldn't work openly.
I did what I could.
I worked secretly.
Now, she's gone.
- Philippe, listen to me...
- Please! I want to be alone.
I want to stay here for a while.
Please leave me alone.
- Hello, Alan.
- Hello, Phil.
- I hope it wasn't too trying.
- Thank you.
- I had a talk with my uncle.
- Oh? Did he agree to help you?
No. But I learned some things today...
...that made me more determined than ever to go ahead.
- You still want to work with me?
- Of course I do.
I'll pay you the same salary my uncle does,
...as long as my money holds out.
We'll pick up right where my father left off.
The money isn't important.
It's the chance to follow up on André
Delambre's work that counts.
When do we start?
- Right away.
- Here in the plant?
No. I want to get out of Montreal.
I've got the perfect place to work.
- Would you like to see it?
- Of course!
This was my grandfather's house.
My father loved it so much, the old man left it to him.
So now it's mine.
Phil, it's a mansion.
- Monsieur Philippe, so good to see you.
- And you, madame.
This is Mr. Alan Hinds.
This is Madame Bonnard, my housekeeper.
Pleased, monsieur.
- Mama?
- Hello, Cécile.
Hello, Philippe.
- Cécile, this is my friend Alan Hinds.
- I'm pleased to meet you.
- How do you do?
- Alan's going to work with me here.
I'd like him to have the room next to mine.
Of course. And now you will stay for tea.
Oh, no. I...
Well, it sounds as though we're staying for tea.
While we're waiting let's have a look at the workshop.
You know, Phil, you weren't exaggerating about the girl.
She's a beauty.
Yes, she is. Come along.
Here's where I've been working.
It's fine.
Plenty of room to expand.
Well, this whole situation's ideal.
We can live here in comfort.
We'll have complete privacy.
The nearest neighbor's house is half a mile away.
Good.
- Now the first thing we have to do...
- After we've had tea.
...after we've had tea, is to go back into town...
...and get my father's papers out of the old lab.
I wouldn't want François to know.
There's a watchman there, an old fellow named Gaston.
We may have to lure him away.
Well, he doesn't know me. I'll cook up some kind of a story for him.
All right.
We'll take what we need.
Diagrams, notes of experiments, anything we can find.
Then we'll get to work.
You won't know the old wine cellar when we get through with it.
We'll have it filled with equipment.
We'll let you visit if you bring us biscuits like this to eat.
- I will. I baked them myself.
- I don't believe it.
- Truly I did!
- Really?
You've known each other a long time, haven't you?
Since we were children.
I used to come here to visit my grandfather.
We played together in the garden.
Once Philippe got very angry at me and threw sand in my face!
Threw sand in this lovely creature's face? You cad!
- Philippe!
- What on earth's the matter?
Are you ill, Monsieur Philippe?
You look as if you've just seen a ghost, old man.
It was the fly. The fly disturbed you.
I've always hated them.
I... I'm sorry.
- Now what do we do?
- I don't know.
A water-cooled tetrode would do the job, but it'd cost a fortune.
- Bank account getting anaemic?
- Yes, it is.
Look, Phil, I've been meaning to speak about this.
You've been paying me for three weeks now,
...and I haven't spent a dime.
There's been no need to.
The food and lodging here are wonderful.
So forget about the salary.
Pay me when your gadget's a whopping success, which I'm sure it will be.
Thanks, Alan.
Believe me, I appreciate it.
- Good day, Madame Bonnard.
- Bonjour, Monsieur François.
- Where is Philippe?
- In the cellar, working.
Thank you.
Hello, François.
I wondered how soon you'd find me.
Well, it didn't take a genius to do that.
Well, I see you've gone ahead, against my wishes.
Well, this is my house.
I've used my own money.
- So you knew Alan Hinds was with me?
- Yes, of course.
I suspected that when he left my employ.
Thanks for your loyalty.
Well, as you said, this is your house.
Now I suppose you'll ask me to leave.
No, François, I wouldn't do that.
As a matter of fact
I'm glad you came here.
You've saved me a trip into town.
The truth is, I've about run out of money.
- I said I wouldn't back you.
- Yes, you did say that.
But I am half-owner of Delambre Frères?
Yes, you are.
All right, I want my half.
Nonsense. You can't divide a business like a sack of apples.
I'll sell my half-interest for whatever it will bring,
...to anyone who will buy it.
You can't be serious.
Would you destroy a company that's been in our family for over 100 years?
If I had to.
- You're holding a gun to my head.
- I'm sorry, François.
But if you won't help me,
I'll raise the money any way I can.
Yes, I think you would.
I think you would.
Very well.
Because I have a sense of responsibility to Delambre Freres, even if you do not,
...I'll undertake to supply you with whatever you need.
Thanks, François.
It's going to work. Believe me,
I don't want just your money.
- I want you to work with us.
- I'll work with you.
Not because I'm won over,
...or have any hope that you will succeed where André failed,
...but to protect you, if I can,
...from the deadly consequences of building this device.
And I'll keep on trying to dissuade you every step of the way...
...from continuing with this project.
That's fine. You're welcome to try.
But just work with me.
I promise you'll come to believe in this thing as firmly as I do.
- We'll see.
- We will see.
- When can I order new equipment?
- Whenever you like.
- Today?
- If you like.
I'll meet you at the plant.
Very well.
Phil, you were wonderful.
Now we can really get started.
I'm sorry I had to do it that way.
I'll tag along with you if you don't mind.
- I've got some errands in town.
- All right.
- I'll pick you up here about three.
- Three it is.
Taxi!
- Hello, Ronnie.
- Not Ronnie. Alan Hinds, if you please.
Well, Mr. Hinds, what brings you here?
- Money.
- Did you say money?
- You'll get none from me, my boy.
- Just a moment, my fine fat friend.
What would you say if
I told you I'm on the track...
...of something worth millions?
- I'd say you were lying.
- Not this time, Max.
Look, one thing you'll admit:
I know about electronics.
I've been working for Delambre Freres.
The new radar for the
Canadian Air Force. Might be valuable.
Max, this is no radar.
It's something really fantastic,
...and I'm in a great spot to steal it.
Go ahead and steal it.
Why come to me?
I need someone to sell it for me.
I'll nab the drawings and specifications. You sell them.
Ronnie, you'd double-cross your own mother.
So would you.
But there's plenty for both of us.
- I tell you, it's tremendous.
- Very well, it's tremendous.
What is it?
Were you here in Montreal when André Delambre was killed?
- I was.
- Do you recall some strange rumours...
...about the project he was working on at the time of his death?
Yes, I do.
You get in touch with the leading...
...electronics outfits, the big international cartels.
Ask them just one thing:
If they're interested in a disintegrator-integrator.
Then sit back and wait for the offers to come in.
They'll want something to go on, some sort of proof.
I'll bring you something in a day or so.
Just enough to whet their appetites.
Anything we get we split 50-50. A deal?
I'll work with you.
Not that I trust you.
Naturally not - you'd be a fool to.
And you're no fool.
A greedy pig perhaps, but no fool.
Thank you. By the way, where can I reach you if I need you?
Max! Please give me credit for a little sense too.
You'll hear from me when I'm ready.
- You can depend on me.
- I'm sure of that.
With the British police looking for you, you wouldn't dare play games with me.
How many years would they give you if they took you back to London?
Nothing like that.
Hanging, perhaps, but no prison.
You see, I once terminated a partnership with a chap who proved unreliable.
As a matter of fact, I terminated him.
- Goodbye, Max.
- Goodbye, Ronnie.
Alan! What are you doing in this part of town?
An old friend -
I... I visit him whenever I'm in town.
OK, Alan. It all checks out.
Well, sir, now that we're ready to give it a go,
...would you like to make a little wager?
Not as sceptical as you were?
I knew we'd make a believer of you.
Since an ashtray was the first object transmitted in Father's experiments,
...I consider it only fitting that we use one in ours.
- Perfect.
- No transposition.
None.
- Morning, Philippe.
- Morning, François.
- Morning, Alan.
- Morning.
- Well what's on our schedule for today?
- We're going to try a live subject.
- A guinea pig?
- Finished here, Phil.
Would you check the fire circuit, François?
Right.
- Giantism!
- Must be in the amplitude control.
Well, let's find it. Let's check everything.
Hello, Cécile.
- It's late.
- Yes, I know.
Thank you, Cécile.
Phil?
Well, he looks perfectly normal.
Put a guinea pig in the disintegrator cabinet, will you, Alan?
Now that we have the giantism's corrected,
...we'll attempt the experiment
Father describes here.
First the disintegration half of the cycle:
"Hold the subject in a disembodied state for a time,"
"...then complete the cycle and bring the subject back."
Disintegration cycle only.
In none of his experiments did he record any ill effects...
...from delayed reintegration.
Well, we'll bring him back tomorrow morning about ten.
All right. I'll make it a point to be back here then.
Come on, Phil. Call it a day.
You can't work day and night, you know.
I'm not tired.
- Too excited, I guess.
- I can understand that.
Got him.
Phil! I'm sorry, old man, really I am.
Here.
What is it? Why do those nasty little brutes bother you?
I'm your friend. You can tell me.
If you are my friend, don't ever do that again.
Certainly not. I won't.
Come on. You've had a big day.
You've got to take care of yourself.
Go on upstairs and get some rest.
Tomorrow will be a big day, too.
I suppose you're right.
Ronald Holmes, you're under arrest.
None of that now! Stand up.
- How did you find me?
- Never mind about that.
Where are all your coppers?
You... you didn't come here alone?
Turn around and put out your hands.
- Philippe, what was it? The lights!
- They dimmed in my room, too.
Alan?
What happened? Every light in the house dimmed.
Short circuit. Stupid of me.
I got the back of this chair tangled with the main power switch.
Hope I didn't ruin anything.
Some chunks of copper melted out.
That's about all.
I don't see how it could affect the machine.
I'm sure it couldn't.
Maybe we should try it,
...bring the rat back a little ahead of schedule.
Wait a minute, Phil.
François said he'd make it a point to be here, didn't he?
I'm sure he'd be offended if we just went ahead without him.
The machine's all right.
The circuit breakers didn't even kick out.
You're probably right.
We'll wait.
I was just going to bed when the lights began to dim.
I just came down to have another look at the ballast circuit.
I'll put the stuff away, then I'll turn in too.
- All right. Good night, Alan.
- Good night.
- Hello?
- Max, I want you to meet me tonight.
- I can't. I've got some work to do.
- It's got to be tonight.
No, I can't come there.
I'll tell you when I see you.
Max, you meet me in 40 minutes...
...out on the old Cross Creek road, a mile west of the highway.
You be there!
- Couldn't this wait until the morning?
- No. I have to get rid of this car now.
Ronnie, what are you up to?
Over she goes, right there.
Well, Max, any interest in our proposition?
Interest? Yes, indeed.
I got in touch with the four biggest concerns.
Two of them are ready to do business.
All they ask is an indication that we've really got it.
Well, here's your indication.
Just enough to show we're on the right track,
...not enough to give away the whole idea.
Right you are.
I'll process this film when I get back.
I'll walk the rest of the way.
You get busy with your contacts,
...show them that film, and line up the best deal you can get.
I'll finish up my end here and get in touch with you tomorrow.
All right, Ronnie.
- Hello, Alan.
- Philippe, you... you startled me.
- What were you doing out there?
- Well I heard a car starting,
...so I went out to investigate.
Madame Bonnard heard a car.
She woke me up and told me about it.
But that was nearly two hours ago.
Oh, no. This was only
10 or 15 minutes ago.
A different car, perhaps.
Mysterious goings-on, eh?
Very mysterious.
Bloodstains there...
It looks as though someone tried to wipe them up.
They are bloodstains, aren't they?
Well, Phil, I'm heartily ashamed, believe me.
You did try to reintegrate the rat, didn't you?
And got nothing.
It's inexcusable, I know, but I was so curious...
...to see whether we had that giantism problem licked,
...that I brought him back to have a look at him.
Go on. You're doing fine.
Well, the little beggar bit me,
...I lost my temper, and I killed him.
- I'm sorry.
- Let's see the wound.
- What?
- Let's see the wound.
Rat bites are dangerous.
They should be cared for.
It's nothing, really.
It's just a scratch.
Not worth bothering about.
You have an explanation for everything, don't you, Alan?
Look, Phil, old man, I...
Let's hear you explain these.
Oh, I can explain those.
But I'm not going to.
With this, a chap doesn't have to do any explaining, does he?
Give me your keys.
Your keys!
Open the cabinet!
I trusted you, Alan.
I'd have given you a fair share of anything I made on the machine.
Open it!
It's too late, Alan.
I've already called the police.
Monsieur François!
A quarrel?
Where is Philippe?
Cécile. Cécile,
I had a telephone call from Philippe.
Some trouble about Alan. Where is he?
- They fought, monsieur.
- Fought? Who fought?
Alan? Philippe? Where? Where?
Down there. Philippe cried out.
And then I heard the machine!
The machine?!
Alan? Alan?
Alan, where?
Where's Philippe?
That's an interesting question, Mr. Delambre.
Where is he?
Shall we say, he's sewing the cause of science?
Alan!
- Monsieur François!
- Help me get inside.
This is a terrible wound, monsieur.
Please let me call a doctor.
No, I've got to get down to the laboratory.
It's the only way to save Philippe.
Help...
The police.
I don't want the police here...
...until I've finished with the machine.
Madame Bonnard, delay them if you can.
Halt!
Police Department.
- Police Department.
- This is Sergeant Dubois.
We have an injured man, gunshot wound.
Send an ambulance to 418 Cromwell Road.
Help me! Cécile!
Help me!
I'm here! On the door! Cécile!!
Help me!
Cécile!
Monsieur? What is it?
- Good morning, Lieutenant.
- Where's Delambre?
Just back from surgery.
They got the bullet out.
I want to talk to him.
I'm told it'll take several hours, and then some.
This whole thing is beginning to tie together.
The handcuffs were Evans' all right,
...and it's my belief that he's been killed.
There were bloodstains on the ground outside...
...and marks where someone had been dragged to a car.
I want to talk to François Delambre as soon as he's conscious.
Yes sir.
Thank you.
Get Lieutenant MacLish, please.
Monsieur Delambre,
I am Sergeant Dubois, Police Department.
Did you... Did you catch him?
Your nephew? No, we did not.
But you saw him.
You know. You saw the creature.
The creature, sir? My men and I saw someone in the laboratory.
He disobeyed an order to halt,
...so I fired, but he escaped.
Then you didn't see him?
We didn't see his face, if that's what you mean.
It was your nephew, wasn't it?
I must talk to Inspector Beauchamp.
I'm sorry, but Inspector Beauchamp is out of town on official business.
- Lieutenant MacLish is in charge.
- I...
I must talk to Inspector Beauchamp.
Monsieur Delambre, this is Lieutenant MacLish.
I won't speak to anyone but Inspector Beauchamp.
Mr. Delambre, I'm in charge here.
You will kindly answer my questions.
Why did your nephew run away?
I demand the right to speak to Inspector Beauchamp!
Mr. Delambre, your continued refusal may cost your nephew his life!
He has repeatedly disobeyed orders to halt.
Now my men have orders to shoot on sight.
No... That would be murder.
- He's done nothing.
- Then why did he run from us?
I want to see Inspector Beauchamp.
- Stay with him.
- Yes, sir.
Monsieur Delambre... Tell me, please, why must you talk to
Inspector Beauchamp?
Why?
He aided Inspector Charas in the investigation of...
...my brother's death.
He knows the... the terrible secret.
You wouldn't believe...
You would not believe...
This terrible secret...
Does it concern a fly?
What... What did you see?
- What did you see?!
- Nothing.
I... I thought I... It is nothing.
I'll get in touch with Inspector Beauchamp at once.
Hello? Ronnie? Where are you?
I've been getting the material organized. You all set on your end?
Yes, yes, all set. They've got the money ready.
I must say, you've botched things thoroughly.
There's no doubt of it.
Young Delambre is looking for you.
Exactly. He's looking for me.
You have nothing to worry about.
Perhaps not. But I suggest you hurry.
Thank you.
Inspector Beauchamp...
Thank God you're here.
Inspector, it's... it's happened again. To Philippe.
Yes, when I heard about the laboratory and that strange machine, I knew...
The machine... The machine must not be tampered with.
If it's disturbed,
Philippe will be lost forever.
It won't be touched, I assure you.
If...
- If Philippe is taken alive...
- Yes?
If Philippe is taken alive,
...we still have to find the tiny creature, you remember?
Yes, I remember.
We'll find it. I'll go to the laboratory myself.
The integrator cabinet was smashed.
I've... I've instructed them to make a new one.
Yes, but will you have the strength to operate...
...the machine when the time comes?
- I'll find the strength.
- I'm sure you will.
Take him upstairs, please.
Mademoiselle, I'm Inspector Beauchamp.
Would you mind taking me to Mr. Philippe's workshop, please?
I will show you.
Cécile! I'm Philippe!
Philippe!
No one will help me!
Cécile! Cécile!
Cécile! I'm Philippe!
Philippe! No one will help me!
Cécile! Cécile!!
Cécile!
I'm Philippe! Philippe!
Help me! Cécile!
Cécile! Cécile!
- Nurse, would you excuse us, please?
- Yes, Inspector.
- Did you catch it?
- Yes, I caught it.
It seemed feeble. I gave it food.
How long does a fly live?
Musca domestica, common housefly:
Life span about three weeks.
But they die very quickly when it's cold.
I'll see that the laboratory is kept warm.
But how can we know how much of its life span this creature has left?
It seems so hopeless,
Inspector. So hopeless.
My dear friend, nothing is ever hopeless.
But with 100 men searching for him,
...hunting him down as though he were a wild animal...
How can he elude 100 men?
Perhaps he's dead already.
Wounded by one of your police bullets,
...he may have crawled into some lonely thicket to die.
Keep up your courage.
You're going to need it, all of it, when we find him.
What is it?
- The man you knew as Alan Hinds.
- Yes?
He's dead. Neck bones crushed by some gigantic pressure.
Also, a notorious dealer in stolen property named Max Barthold.
Did Philippe do it?
- What can we do?
- Wait until the police catch Philippe.
Or, if he evades them, wait until he comes here.
You and the girl and her mother...
...are the only ones he can possibly turn to for help.
- Inspector...
- Yes?
Suppose he does come here.
And suppose he's not like André.
When this same ghastly thing happened to my brother,
...he still had a human mind and a human conscience.
What if Philippe does not have the mind...
...of a human, but the murderous brain of the fly?
I pray that he does not.
But if he does come here, not for help, but...
...to kill?
Then he will have to be destroyed.
Inspector! Please, help me!
Tell François he's needed in the laboratory.
He'll understand and do not let the nurse interfere.
I'm all right.
Put him in the cabinet, quickly.
This is the worst storm yet.
Yeah, almost every night for the last three months.
Well, it sure ain't natural.
I'm getting away from this lightning while I still can.
Ah, you'll be soaked to the bone before you get ten yards.
Well I'd better be soaked than barbecued.
What if we ran for it?
It's impossible to make it to the main road.
Maybe we can make it to the old willows place?
Are you out of your mind?
Do you actually believe in them monsters?
But the newspaper story said...
Oh, act your age, Mac.
Here's the house.
Don't look good to me.
Ah, you're just spooked.
Well, spooked or not, that place just don't look healthy.
It hasn't been lived in in 15 years, it's deserted.
It is, huh?
Thought you said this place was deserted?
Well, it's supposed to be. I don't get it. what do you want?
Let's get out of here.
Uh, we didn't think anybody lived here.
It was all his idea.
We thought maybe we could get out of the rain.
It looks like it's going to last all night.
It's pretty bad out there.
Oh no, you can't stay.
Oh, be reasonable.
You can't stay.
We might catch pneumonia.
You're not welcome in my house.
Go away, now, go, go, go.
Lobo!
Lobo! No, no!
The monster!
Now you believe those newspaper stories?
Do you hear that, lobo?
You're the monster.
Perhaps, one day you will meet the monster.
Heh, heh, heh.
Wait, wait!
I can't run anymore.
We gotta keep going.
That was the monster.
Well, I wouldn't give to see a couple of cops right about now.
Come on. you, get these straps off of me.
Let me loose, do you hear me?
Lobo hears, but he cannot speak.
Lobo is mute.
Because of the storm, I was afraid we were not going to have guests tonight.
Lobo, you're too rough with my patient.
Already, he tires of our humble hospitality.
I said, let me out of here.
At the moment, i am afraid it is impossible.
Who are you?
Vornoff, Dr. Eric vornoff.
The name will mean little to you. what are you doing to me?
You will be soon as big as a giant.
Strength of 20 men.
Or, like all the others, dead.
Turn off the switch.
Isn't it strange, lobo?
Our friend always returns home after his long, tiresome swim.
What's your name?
You find out.
We will.
Hey, watch that cigarette.
What were you doing in the swamp?
What's it to you?
That's enough of that, buster.
No tank town jail can hold me.
I'll be out of this here rat trap in 24 hours.
That's what you think.
Vagrancy will hold you for 72 hours.
Take him downstairs and book him.
All right, let's go.
Let go of me, I said.
You can't do that to me.
Let go.
Hey, where do you think you're going?
What do you mean, where do I think I'm going?
I've got captain
Robbins' newspapers.
You have, have you?
And since when you don't leave the captain's papers with me?
Since the captain told me to bring 'em in myself.
When you read 'em first, you mess 'em up.
Hold your tongue and give me those papers or I'll have you locked up for peddling without a license.
I got a license.
Want to bet I can make it expire all of a sudden?
Come in.
Here's the late editions, captain.
Look, why can't i work on this case?
Get back to your desk.
Yes, sir.
- And kelton.
Yes, sir?
I told the boy to bring the papers in himself.
Yes, sir.
But if you ask me...
I didn't.
Yes, sir.
- And kelton.
Yes, sir?
Where's lieutenant Craig?
In his office, I think.
Send him in.
Yes, sir, right away, sir. come in.
Hi, captain.
Hello, dick, sit down.
Seen today's papers?
Is there anyone who hasn't?
Well, there's the one nice thing about birds.
They never cause anybody any trouble.
Your girlfriend writes a good story.
She thinks so.
Anything new.
No.
12 disappearances around this place and nothing to go on.
And nothing this time either.
Been around that swamp so many times, I'm getting web-footed.
It's been fired recently.
It's been fired several times recently. jake long's wife identified it a little while ago.
The coat belonged to
Ralph mcrae, his partner.
They went hunting by marsh lake and never returned.
Not much left of it.
Boys found it floating in the lake.
What about the rifle?
About a mile from the old willows place.
All ties together.
But it doesn't prove anything.
You think there's anything in these monster stories?
Your girlfriend does.
What about you?
The police don't believe in monsters.
Facts are our business.
Facts and only facts, and don't you forget it.
I'm telling you, the captain isn't seeing nobody.
Now please be a good girl, miss lawton, and go.
Captain Robbins, will you tell this junior g-man to let me go?
Kelton.
Yes, sir.
Let her go.
Just as you say, captain.
It used to be a newspaper reporter could get information around this place.
What in the world do you mean?
Now, he makes like a comic.
Dick Craig, I don't put much stock in the future success of our married life if already you're holding out secrets on me.
You've been dodging me all day.
Where'd you get an idea like that?
You mean you haven't been dodging me?
No.
And all those times I called.
And kelton said the line was busy, it really was?
Yes.
Ok, let's have the story on lake marsh and the monster.
Uh... monster, monster... aaah.
I thought so.
There is no such thing as monsters, this is the 20th century.
Don't count on it.
Monsters, I mean.
Now, Janet.
Don't you "now, Janet" me.
And you can count our engagement off.
- You don't mean that.
Yes, I do.
No, she doesn't.
I most certainly do.
Well, then, give him back the ring.
What?
If you're throwing over the marriage, give him back the ring.
Now, chief, I...
Captain.
Give him back the rock.
It's the only fair thing.
I'd rather throw it in lake marsh first.
Besides, we've got to leave our personal lives out of our business lives.
As it should be.
As I've been saying all along.
Dog! Now, what about the monster story?
Well, that's your own story.
You wrote it and you're stuck with it.
There's no such thing as monsters.
But two more men have vanished up at lake marsh.
That makes
12 in three months.
Everything points to an inhuman violence.
Or do you still stick to the alligator devouring routine?
Oh!
You're withholding news from the public.
Janet, you may not believe this, but you got all the story there is.
You're right, i don't believe it.
Well, nevertheless, it's the truth.
Except for the monster, figment of your very vivid imagination.
While we've got nothing more to go on than what you reported to the paper.
The figment of my imagination is something I believe and you haven't been able to disprove it.
We've conducted every possible search.
Monsters, it's fantastic.
You know that.
Our business is dealing in facts, evidence.
Can't you see that?
Men disappearing. Huh.
There's plenty of quicksand out there.
Yeah,
12 went down in the same place.
Well, we're doing our best to solve it.
Maybe your best isn't good enough.
- Janet!
No, I mean it.
No clues.
What's this, a dancing costume?
And this, a pogo stick?
Well, I've got to admit those we're found at the lake.
But remember, they were in your own story.
No human did this.
So you say.
Well, looks like I've run into a dead end around here.
Ok, if you boys wanna play a game of secrets., there's nothing left for me to do but take a run out to lake marsh myself.
Over my dead body.
That could be arranged.
Goodbye.
She's just crazy enough to do what she says.
- You know what, captain?
What?
I think you're right.
Hi, tillie.
Hi, Janet.
Long time no see.
Tillie, do you remember a couple of years ago in the real estate section when the old willows place out on lake marsh was up for sale, against back taxes?
Seems to me that was around
November or December of '48.
- Wanna see the files?
Yes.
Just a minute.
Here they are.
October to December, '48.
In the top file there.
I won't be long.
Take your time I ain't going anyplace, and neither are they.
Find what you wanted, Janet?
Yes, thanks. Sorry to leave such a mess for you.
Well, that's what I get paid for.
Be a dear, tillie.
Call the boss.
Tell him I'll be gone the rest of the day,
- I'll report in later.
Sure thing.
On something hot?
Oh, it could be.
Oh, and dick.
Call him at headquarters, break my dinner date with him.
Tell him I... I have an ulcer or something.
Leave it to me. I fix.
Ok.
- Hi, Janet.
Oh, hi, Marge.
Janet. Still on the monster hunt?
What do you think?
I think the boss has been looking for you all day.
Something about the police wanting those monster stories 86'd.
You've got the whole town in a panic.
I didn't hear you.
- I said...
I know what you said.
But I didn't hear you.
I get it. See you later.
Lieutenant Craig has been working on the case a long time, professor.
I'd like him to hear what you just told me.
I should be happy to cooperate.
Oh, hello, dick.
Professor Vladimir strowski, lieutenant Craig.
Glad to meet you, professor.
How do you do?
Professor, will you bring him up to date?
Lieutenant Craig, have you ever heard of loch ness?
I think so. That's a lake in Scotland, isn't it?
Mm. Then perhaps you are familiar with the loch ness monster.
Vaguely.
A few years ago, I was called in by the British police to investigate the appearance of a monster at loch ness.
Well, they thought that it was some creature left over from a bygone age.
I am considered an authority on the subject of prehistoric monsters.
However, I must admit that my investigation failed to get the desired results, in that I did not see the monster myself.
But others did.
There are sworn statements.
Professor, is it your theory that perhaps the loch ness monster crossed the ocean and came to the swamp?
I consider that possibility extremely remote.
But the cases do bear a certain similarity, in that there are so many varied descriptions of this so-called monster.
And I thought perhaps, with my knowledge of such things, and with your permission, of course, that I might be able to shed some light on this mystery.
That is the reason for my presence here.
What do you think, dick?
Well, there's no denying we need help of some sort.
And you'll keep your findings secret for the time being?
As you will.
And you don't mind a little company?
How do you mean, company?
Lieutenant Craig.
At times, the police can be quite useful.
I should be most happy to have lieutenant Craig's assistance.
How soon can you be ready to leave for lake marsh, lieutenant Craig?
I'm ready.
Well, I suggest we wait until morning.
There was a storm brewing when I came in.
And it is so close to nightfall.
According to reports, the monster strikes only at night.
Undoubtedly true, but the preliminary investigation should take place in daylight.
The night, the monster, all in good time.
Sounds logical.
Whatever you say.
Now, gentlemen, since I just arrived in town this afternoon, if you will excuse me, i should like to return to my hotel.
Certainly, sir.
Good day, captain.
Professor.
Until morning, lieutenant Craig.
I'll be here.
Strange sort of bird.
Where do I meet him?
Here, ten o'clock.
That will give him plenty of daylight.
Well, see you later.
Hmm, got a date?
What do you think?
I'll say you don't.
I don't?
Girl from her office called in.
Said that Janet had a headache or some such thing.
If she's gone to lake marsh alone.
I'll take her across my knee, if it's the last thing I do.
Well, it probably would be.
Watch him, dick.
Strowski?
Just a hunch.
Right. you are all right now, my dear.
What?
Who... who are you?
I'm... I'm Dr. Eric vornoff.
You had a severe shock.
Oh.
How did I get here?
Oh.
That's not important for the moment.
What you need now is rest.
Rest.
You will sleep.
Sleep.
For the lovely young lady, sleep.
Well, here we are at the fork in the road.
Like they say in all good westerns, which way to go?
Well, that's the road to the willows place.
Let's take a chance on that one.
Ok. You know, i get to hate this swamp more every time I come out here.
You just weren't born for swamp duty, Marty.
Yeah, I guess you're right.
I'd like to transfer to a department as far away from here as possible.
The wind and the rain.
Gives this place a gleam that just isn't natural.
The ground alive with crawling things, crawling death.
You're right there, Marty.
This swamp is a monument to death.
Snakes, alligators, quicksand, all bent on one thing.
Destruction.
Something strange about all this rain.
The lightning's been going crazy too.
Maybe it's like the papers said.
All these atom bomb explosions distorted the atmosphere.
Maybe.
You know, if I was this professor strowski guy, i wouldn't come out in this swamp without a guide.
You know, that's the one thing I can't figure.
He comes to the office with all these monster stories, makes an appointment to come out here with us, then he goes off by himself.
Are you sure he came out here?
Where else could he go?
Well, let's get at it.
Hm.
Janet's car?
Yeah, there's not a trace of her.
Well, maybe after the accident she found her way down to the road and then back into town.
I've gotta be sure.
Look, there's a coffee joint about ten miles back, let's go and check.
- Let's go.
Ok.
Where did you find her car?
Not a sign of her?
Where's strowski?
I told you not to let him out of your sight.
Right, captain.
I don't like the looks of things.
Well, get back to strowski.
I'll get word to you later.
Yeah.
You look worried, dick.
No one.
Captain Robbins, her apartment, her office.
No one has heard from her since yesterday afternoon.
Captain Robbins is checking further.
Ok, but what do we do?
Orders, find strowski.
Ah, get me the city desk.
Hello, Jim.
Yeah, about the lawton girl.
Uh, he just called me too.
Who saw her last around your office?
Don't be afraid of lobo.
He's as gentle as a kitten.
Put the tray down here.
 That is all.
Get out.
I said, get out! that is all.
Now come, my dear.
Some cream or sugar?
You didn't have your breakfast yet.
Now it's past noon.
You must be hungry.
What happened to me?
Your automobile, an accident.
Lobo brought you here.
To me.
What is this place?
And who are you?
Don't you remember i told you last night?
Did you tell me?
Yes, I'm Dr. Eric vornoff.
Oh. This is the old willows place.
Yes.
How did you know?
I checked our real estate files.
A Dr. Eric vornoff bought the willows place in November of 1948.
You are a newspaper reporter, huh?
Yes.
My name seems to mean much to you.
Well, actually it wasn't your name I was interested in.
Through the mysteries of lake marsh, and the willows place being right on the lake.
I looked in the files to see what happened to it.
Your name was there as the purchaser.
I thought perhaps you might have heard something about the monster.
Oh, my dear miss lawton. I...
When did I tell you my name?
You didn't.
But since you were unconscious, i took the Liberty looking into your purse.
You must have seen my press card.
Yes, I did.
Well, since you knew the answers already, why the third degree?
And who or what was that monster?
Oh, he's quite human.
I discovered him in the wilderness of Tibet.
He has been quite useful to me... at times.
But now, since your tiring experience, i think we have talked too much.
I'm not the least bit tired.
But you are tired.
You are so tired.
Strange.
Suddenly, I...
I do feel very tired.
Yes.
Very tired.
Very tired.
Lobo! Take the girl to my quarters.
My dear professor strowski.
Well, it has been a very long time.
Vornoff.
It is you.
You can see.
In Paris, i missed you by a month.
In London, a week.
At loch ness, by only one day.
The monster of lake marsh sounded again like you.
Why the sudden interest in me, professor strowski?
Your experiments in atomic energy, of course.
Ah, so my dear country now believes in my work.
And that it can be a success.
Our government wants you to return, vornoff, to continue your research and experiments there, where you can have everything at your disposal.
Why do you laugh?
Surely this is not a laughing matter?
My dear professor strowski.
20 years ago, i was banned from my homeland.
Parted from my wife and son, never to see them again.
Why?
Because I suggested to use the atom elements for producing super beings.
Beings of unthinkable strength and size.
I was classed as a madman, a charlatan, outlawed in the world of science which previously honored me as a genius.
Now, here in this forsaken jungle hell, i have proven that I'm all right!
Now, professor strowski, it is no laughing matter.
Yes. Yes, indeed it was a tragic error.
But, as soon as I had learned how correct your findings were, always have been,
I informed those in authority.
Vornoff, I have searched for you everywhere, everywhere I hear stories of monsters.
Now, I am here, sent to bring you home.
Home?
I have no home.
Hunted, despised, living like an animal, the jungle is my home.
But I will show the world that I can be its master.
I will perfect my own race of people.
A race of atomic supermen which will conquer the world.
Yes. Yes, of course.
A truly great master race, such as I convinced my superiors only you could create.
One with which our government can rule the world without debate.
You misunderstand me, strowski.
I don't intend to return home.
My plans are for myself.
Are you mad, vornoff?
One is always considered mad, when one discovers something that others cannot grasp.
Our government ordered me to bring you back.
I'm afraid you will find that rather difficult.
You see, vornoff, i did not come alone.
Neither did I, my dear strowski.
Bring him along, lobo.
Come, come.
Hurry!
You are a fool, vornoff.
You... you may... you may kill me, but others will come.
Silence.
You will never get away with this.
Put him in there.
Vornoff! Vornoff! No! No!
Help! Help!
Vornoff! Vornoff!
Vornoff!
Now, professor strowski, you will get a much closer view of the product of my genius.
The alleged monster of lake marsh.
Vornoff! Vornoff!
Vornoff! Vornoff!
Your country offers fame and fortune for my return, but my price is so much more great.
You will disappear, professor strowski, just as all the others have disappeared. vornoff! Vornoff!
It's a rental car.
Think it's the one strowski used?
I'd make book it is.
It's getting dark now.
You take the car, and go down to the beach.
I'll go through the swamp to the old willows place.
Ok.
Oh, here.
You'd better take this with you.
Right.
- Oh, Marty?
- Yeah?
You see anything suspicious, you know where I am.
Trouble is, everything in this swamp is suspicious.
What can I do for you, sir?
Captain Robbins, homicide.
Why, captain I haven't murdered anyone in a month of Sundays.
Did Janet lawton stop by here late yesterday afternoon?
Oh, just a like a policeman, no sense of humor.
Yes, she stopped by late in the afternoon.
Remember the time?
Well, not to the second.
She came in around two, and left around 3:30.
Then again, that isn't so late, is it?
What'd she want?
She was looking for information.
That I'm sure of.
Do you happen to know what that information was?
Well, sure.
- Well?
Well, what?
Must we play games?
I didn't know we were.
What was miss lawton looking for in the files?
Oh, well, why didn't you ask that in the first place instead of all your chit-chat?
She was looking over the real estate files in October, November and December of 1948.
In particular, the sale of the old willows place, out on lake marsh.
Did she find what she was looking for?
Well I guess she did. At least, she found the sales notice.
I saw it myself after she rushed out.
She left the paper open at the November 26th date.
Wanna see it?
Why, very much.
Well, it's right up there.
I haven't had time to put it back yet.
Yeah, Dr. Eric vornoff.
Give me all you have on him.
I'll hang on.
Are we ready for the girl?
Here.
Oh, lovely.
Strap her to the table.
Do as I command you.
I'll teach you to disobey.
You will obey.
Strap her in.
Strap her in, I command you.
Get the equipment ready.
It will hurt just for a moment, and then you will emerge a woman of super strength and beauty.
The bride of the atom.
You are insane.
My paper knows where I am.
You can't hurt me and get away with it.
As soon as my experiments are completed, no one can ever touch me,
I will make the law.
Either way, whether I succeed or fail, it will not hurt you very long.
Let me go! Let me go!
You heard what she said.
Who are you?
For one thing, the police.
Now turn her loose and make it fast.
You have the advantage for the moment.
Stop talking and turn her loose.
Dick.
Take him out, quickly.
Where's lieutenant Craig?
We found strowski's car down the road.
Lieutenant took off through the swamp.
Sent me down here to the beach to wait for him.
Where was he heading?
Old willows place.
- Kelton.
Yes, sir.
Now, this is your first time out.
- Don't mess up the operation.
Yes, sir.
I mean no, sir. martin, you stay with me.
Yes, sir.
Come on.
I'm sure my experiments on the young lady will interest you.
I'll live to see you hang.
There are much more important things to attend.
I hope the straps are not cutting.
Such lovely skin should not be marred.
Lobo, stop.
Stop. Stop, I command!
Stop! easy, Janet.
Janet, get me the gun.
Easy.
I've gotta stop him.
You can't, he'll kill you.
He probably will anyway.
Stay here.
Turn that thing off.
Lobo!
No! No!
Stop.
I beg you! stop!
Kelton, you station yourself here.
You men surround the house. martin, you come with me.
All right, captain.
- Ready?
Right. look, the place is on fire.
Let's get out of here before we get roasted.
Ca... captain, look!
What do you suppose that was?
Well, whatever it is, get it.
Oh, wait a minute.
Here comes dick.
He's got Janet.
Get him!
No, don't shoot!
You might hit Janet.
Let's go.
- Marty.
Yeah?
Give me a gun.
Here you go.
There he goes!
Can I suggest something, captain?
No!
Now get on up over that ledge.
Get up over on top of him.
That's what I was gonna suggest.
Well, stop the chattering.
- Get in action.
Yes, sir.
Now he's clear.
Give it to him.
I think it's broken.
Don't move, buddy. he tampered in god's domain.
He's cold.
We'll be home in a couple of minutes.
His teeth are chattering.
You gonna make friends with this one, too?
He is cold.
Come here.
He's relaxing.
He likes me.
Me, too.
Frank?
Patrick.
Aw, Jan, you know how much this means to me.
Get with it, will you, baby?
Frank!
Hey, Frank!
Oh.
No.
Oh, Frank.
Come on.
Ok, colonel. Ok.
Lay off. Stop it.
Ready for duty.
Always ready.
Yes, sir, colonel.
Jan, put on some coffee.
Don't I always put a pot of coffee on the stove before I pass out?
There's lots of coffee.
Oh, my dear
Dr. Schratt, you sober up with more grace than anybody I ever saw.
You're terrific.
Come on, let's go.
Are you kiddin'?
Look.
Nope.
Frank, don't let me down.
What's more useless than a surgeon with a hangover?
I'm a drunken zero.
I pass.
No, you don't.
I'd rather have you do a corneal transplant for me drunk than anybody else sober.
Let's go, boy.
You're brilliant, but not normal.
Heh heh. So are you, but are you, and who is?
Uhh.
Great.
Come on, boy.
Hit the showers.
Turn in your suit.
Get me a long carotid this time, will you?
Yes, indeed.
Clean to the last teeny pore.
Darling, junior's falling asleep.
Good.
Look, he's the first who's not scared.
That's a break for us.
Less problem with clots.
Pat, couldn't I keep him as a pet?
I thought I was your pet.
Set him on the table, honey.
He's so young, so trusting.
He trusts me.
Must be just a baby.
Pat...
The others were too old.
Maybe that's why we failed.
This is your fifth try.
It seems so pointless.
4 wasted lives.
Monkey lives, and is it pointless for animals to help save human life?
One soldier, one mother in an auto accident, one half-drowned boy, one baby girl feverish with freckles and a dimple.
You're right, darling.
I'm being silly.
Thanks, dear.
Now go make us one of those wonderful stews, will you?
She is really something.
So are you, pal.
Ok, you're on.
This is the day.
I feel it.
Me, too.
In about 30 minutes, we'll have a monkey brain...
Alive.
Well, yes or no?
Frank, the pump.
Now the motor.
Jan, check the oscillograph.
For the fifth and last time,
I hope, nothing.
Keep watching it.
Frank, up 5 microvolts.
An Alpha curve.
Faint, but it's here.
Up 5 more.
The curve's firm and normal.
Honey, take a look.
It's something, kids.
A brain without a body...
Alive.
It's wonderful.
Great work, Frank.
Congratulations.
Terrific, but
I'm glad it's over.
All set, darling.
Immediately upon removal,
2 electrodes fastened to cortical tissue.
If that's for me, I'm not here.
Hello?
No, Dr. Schratt's not here.
Well, I don't know about Dr. Cory.
Oh, hold on a minute.
Pat, it's the chief ranger.
There's been an airplane accident.
He thinks some of the passengers may still be alive.
Why don't they get Frank?
He'll be in town in a half an hour.
That half hour might save a human life.
This is Cory.
I'll be glad to help.
Where do I meet you?
I'll be there as quickly as possible.
Honey, take care of things.
Notes of everything, huh?
I'll watch every second.
Yeah.
Ok, boys.
Set him down.
He'll never make it to the hospital.
What about your place, doc?
It's only a couple of miles.
I don't think he has a chance, but it's worth a try.
Ok.
This way, fellas.
Still living?
Perfect.
Same as when you left.
What about the wreck?
Three dead, one survivor.
He's in bad shape.
Give me a hand with this, boys.
Put the head right over here.
Jan, give them scissors.
Easy now, fellas.
Fast as you can, cut away the clothes.
Tuttle, help with the sheet there.
You'll find 'em in the side drawer.
Better get Frank.
He's running a temperature.
I think he's asleep.
Wake him up.
Get him.
You pull him through, doc, you should be set for life.
How do you mean?
That's Warren h. Donovan.
Means nothing to me.
He's supposed to be worth a hundred million.
The sky's the limit on your fee.
Money can't help him now.
All right, boys.
Thanks very much.
That's swell.
You can go.
Frank'll be here in a minute.
Honey, we'll need your help.
Will you get the gowns and things?
Hurry up, Frank.
Why weren't you in your office?
The whole wide world is my office.
How bad is he?
Both legs completely gone.
His chest is crushed.
Tuttle, you better get into the hospital.
If we pull him through, we'll need a lot of things.
Right. I'll call you as soon as I get to town.
We'll know for sure by then.
We'll need adrenaline, and I'd start plasma right now.
Frank, you take care of the chest.
I'll do the legs.
Clamp.
Uh...
What's the pulse?
None.
I think he's gone.
Adrenaline.
Let Frank do it.
Right into the heart.
Not a flicker.
Try a massage.
Still nothing.
Any idea who the poor man was?
Some millionaire, name of Donovan,
Tuttle said.
Absolutely nothing.
Hmm.
Any ideas?
I wouldn't have wasted this much time.
All right, that's that.
Thanks for covering for me, pat.
Tuttle hates my guts.
He'd love to see his brother in my job.
Well, you go on back to bed.
I'll tell him you were sick.
Make out the death certificate first, though.
That's not my department.
Why don't I park
Mr. Donovan in the garage?
All right. Thanks.
Wait a minute.
Hold everything.
Watch the current, will you, Frank?
Jan, give us readings.
What's the big idea?
I'm curious, that's all.
What about it, Jan?
There must be something wrong.
There are indications of Alpha waves.
Not too unusual.
In violent death, like the plane crash, organs of the body die at different times, and his brain's still alive.
You're right.
The waves aren't weakening at all.
Come on, Frank, I think we have time enough.
Time for what?
Donovan's dead, isn't he?
Beyond all help?
So?
Science can use Donovan's brain.
Hurry, or we'll never make it.
You're crazy.
Count me out.
It's against the law to operate on a corpse.
It could mean jail.
And for what?
What do you hope to prove?
There's no time to talk now.
Either help me, or leave me on my own.
Please, darling, don't...
Believe in me, will you, baby?
Get the instruments out of the sterilizer.
Quickly.
The bottom tray.
You're wackier sober than I ever was crocked.
What an idea, stealing a man's brain.
Second success of the day.
To Patrick Cory, doctor of science, who plays miracle man on the side.
Now will you tell us why?
Jan, please, 40th minute...
Tissue regains color, complete recovery from surgical shock.
It's simple, Frank.
We have blood banks, bone banks, eye banks, corneal transplants from dead to living.
Jan, arteries resuming pre-operative state.
Add the time.
So what? Preservation of tissue is nothing new.
Why risk a jail sentence for that?
If this brain lives, maybe we can discover how it thinks.
Impossible.
It can't see, it can't hear, and it can't feel.
That's correct.
The brain itself can't.
That's why this one feels no pain even though it's still alive, but this brain contains all the knowledge and experience of Warren Donovan's entire life.
In other words, all his thoughts.
The impulses of these thoughts, then, must still be alive.
You're just guessing, aren't you?
Am I?
What do you think is registering on the oscillograph?
I'm a doctor, not an electrician.
For all I know, that thing would move even without the brain.
Let's see. Fluid level has dropped 2 millimeters.
Do you suppose it could be absorbing nourishment?
Promise me something, will you, pal?
If anyone ever asks any questions about this, you don't even know my name.
I promise.
Well, see ya.
Where are you going?
Still 11 bottles left in that case.
Why don't you take them home with you?
Good idea.
I'm supposed to be home... On duty.
Darling, what about the stew?
Oh, right now, but in here, please.
I'm not budging an inch as long as Mr. Donovan's brain is still alive.
72nd hour, third day.
Current increase...
2 microvolts.
Please, take it off the hook.
Well, let's face it, darling.
If you don't go to town,
Higgins is going to come out here.
Do you want that?
I told you I'd see him, honey, but not now.
Please, don't stop.
If that's Higgins, keep him in the living room.
I'll come out.
All right, but I'm worried.
Frank said there was talk of an autopsy.
How are you going to explain the stitches in his head?
I'll explain 'em.
Here are your chemicals.
Now will you forget that thing and come on back to town with me?
Are they performing an autopsy?
No autopsy yet.
It's just that this Donovan was a very important man.
The c.A.A.
Is investigating the crash, but the main thing is Higgins and Webster are after my neck.
Now will you come on back with me and get me off the spot?
Ok, pal, anything you say.
Just give me a few minutes to shave.
Take over, will you, dear?
Darling...
Wear a tie, huh?
If anyone thinks I was guilty of negligence, why not perform an autopsy?
We considered that, but Mr. Donovan's family decided it wasn't necessary.
Ah, Tuttle.
Tuttle, didn't you tell them we did everything we could?
There's no dispute about that.
Then why am I here?
Principally, with regard to Dr. Schratt.
Now would you say...
Would you say
Dr. Schratt was or was not in condition to perform his duties?
Dr. Schratt was in perfect condition to perform his duties, and he did.
When I tried to reach him, he wasn't at his office.
At Dr. Cory's, he smelled like a barroom, and Mike at the liquor store says he bought a case of that Russian stuff he lives on.
Caviar?
Tuttle, you're a fine ranger.
Why don't you mind your own business?
Mr. Webster, take my word for it.
You couldn't have a more capable person in your employ than Dr. Schratt.
Anything else, gentlemen?
Nothing more for me.
Mr. Donovan's son and daughter are waiting to meet you.
Of course.
I'll buy you a drink sometime, ranger.
What's your version, doc?
Did you know Donovan before?
I asked you men to cooperate.
I'll be back in a minute, fellas.
Please, get me on the way out.
Thanks a lot.
Ok, doc.
Mrs. parton,
Mr. Donovan, Dr. Cory.
Hello, doctor.
How do you do,
Dr. Cory?
I'm very sorry about your father.
Well, thank you, doctor.
My sister and I have been assured everything possible was done.
Believe me, it was.
Did dad say anything before he died?
No. He was unconscious when we got to the wreck, and he stayed that way.
I'd say he passed on very peacefully.
No pain.
We wondered if any papers fell out of his pockets.
Not that I know of.
Are you certain?
You notice anything?
No.
As I told you before,
Dr. Cory and I were concerned only with what we had to do.
We understand.
We're grateful to you both.
If there's ever anything we can do to show our appreciation, please call on us anytime.
By all means, do.
Thank you, I will.
Good luck to you both.
Fellas, I can't add a thing to what you already know.
What about the rumor that Tuttle's brother will replace
Dr. Schratt?
Quote, nobody could be better in his job than Dr. Frank Schratt, unquote.
That's all, boys.
Will you excuse me now?
Sure, doctor.
So far, so good.
Hiya, doc. My name's yocum, herbie yocum.
I freelance for a livin' with my little brownie here.
Came up on my own on spec to do a picture story on Donovan's death.
Well, where do I fit in?
He died at your house, didn't he?
Look, doc,
I'd like to get a shot of the operating table where he kicked off.
That's a little gruesome, isn't it?
Delicious.
The Sunday supplement's eat this stuff up.
I got some shots of
Donovan in the morgue.
What happened to his head?
It was a plane crash, remember?
He had extensive injuries.
Oh, come on, doc.
Give me a break.
If you do, I'll take some shots of your kids.
All right, yocum.
Do you want to follow me in your car?
Are you kiddin'?
The finance company took it 4 payments back.
Doc, you're my chauffeur.
I just added 5 ccs of serum, and there was a small deviation...
We'll talk about it later.
Hey, good lookin' lab you got here, doc.
Oh, a heart, huh?
Hey, a brain.
All right, yocum.
This is where Donovan died.
Take your picture from over there.
Yeah, sure, doc.
And include us out.
Got it?
One more, just in case.
Hey, how about doin' a story on your stuff, doc?
You know, it might be worth a couple of hundred dollars, and I'll split with you.
No, thanks. Uh...
What do you think you're doing?
Oh, doc, you're rushing me.
That one slipped.
You know, I just lost 6 cents.
That's what these bulbs cost me wholesale.
This one ought to do it.
All right.
Take him back to town, will you, please, Frank?
Well, thanks, doc, and if you're ever in Hollywood and need a favor, look me up.
Yocum. Y-o-c-u-m.
The only one in the phone book.
Bye.
How did you ever happen to allow a thing like that?
He wanted some pictures of where Donovan died.
He'd already taken pictures in the morgue, and I was afraid he'd get suspicious if didn't let him come here.
What were you saying now when we came in about a deviation?
Well, it was at 4:40.
I was checking the voltage.
Here comes another one.
This like the 4:40 one?
Yes.
Huh.
2 identical deviations.
Looks like a beta frequency.
Oh, it is.
The brain must be thinking systematically.
Darling, you watch the screen.
I want to try something.
It's another deviation, a bigger one.
Jan...
I feel we are about to stumble onto something very important.
For instance?
Well, I don't know for sure, but we know the brain reacts and reacts differently.
The next step is to find out what these reactions mean.
Specifically, which cells are responsible for thoughts, emotions, actions.
All right, but where do we go from there?
Now you're asking me too much too soon.
These answers may take years.
By the way, how's your Patience?
What do you think?
I think someday you'll be as famous as madame Eve curie.
Well, if I'm as useful to you as she was to her husband,
I'll settle for that.
You're just as useful...
And lot's prettier.
Oh, pat, please go take a nap.
Not now, dear.
You do the sleeping for both of us.
Let me have the notes, please.
Seventh day.
Brain's absorption of nourishment increasing approximately
1 cc per hour.
Growth and pulsations visible to naked eye.
These impulses!
They must mean something.
They must!
More notes?
No, not now, dear.
Pat, I'm worried about Frank.
Why?
He'll show up when he runs out of money.
Don't you feel a little guilty?
If he hadn't been here helping you, he'd have been home on duty when Tuttle called.
Wouldn't have lost his job.
Jan, when a teetotaler takes after a drunk, the drunk doesn't have a chance.
Tuttle's been after
Frank for a year now.
Sometimes I think you're a bad influence.
Why don't you discourage
Frank from drinking?
Oh, perhaps I'll cure Frank and every other alcoholic, if I can solve the mystery of Donovan's brain.
I think it's a matter of chemistry, how the brain thinks.
The problem is to find out what chemical combinations are responsible for success, failure, happiness, misery.
Sounds impossible.
But it isn't.
It can't be.
There has to be a way.
Pat, I wish you'd eat and get a good night's sleep.
Oh, there must be some way.
Now this oscillograph has shown us all kinds of reactions, but what do they mean?
Honey, are you really interested in reactions?
Are you kidding?
Of course.
Well, what about mine?
It looks like we're going to spend the rest of our lives here in this room.
All right.
I don't miss the fresh air, and my cooking smells like carbolic acid, but there's no place in here for you to warm my cold feet on these long winter nights.
I guess if we had about a hundred mirrors, we could watch the brain from every room in the house, couldn't we?
If you think it'll work,
I'll buy them.
Something else will work.
What?
We'll give the brain a voice, and we can hear it from anywhere.
Now who's kidding who?
No, no, no. Honest.
I'll show you.
Look, go get the portable radio, will you?
And the soldering iron.
And a ham sandwich on rye!
See, beautiful?
The same electrical impulses which move the oscillograph can be turned into sound waves.
This thing lets us see the brain think, and the amplifier and loud speaker let us hear.
If I only knew what it was thinking.
It sounds spooky.
Now when did we get superstitious?
I'm not really.
I'm just a little upset.
What about?
Well, now that that thing works, can we go in the other room, sit in front of the fire?
Sure, dear.
That's what it's for.
Welcome home,
Dr. Schratt.
Well, it's about time you showed up.
Can I live in your breakfast nook?
It's been made up for days.
How's the mastermind doing with his stolen brain?
Go take a shower, will you?
What's that noise?
Mr. Donovan thinking out loud.
Oh, very funny.
You look like you could use a shower and a shave and some sleep.
Thank you, Frank.
Pat's letting himself run down like a broken clock.
He won't listen to me.
Look, pal, I've got an idea...
The answer to everything you want to know.
You come along fishing with me for 3 days, and I'll solve all your problems for you.
All right, wise guy, let's have it now.
What you need is a nice big crystal ball.
Oh.
If you didn't have a beard,
I'd kiss you for that.
For what?
Crystal ball, that's it!
The next step...
Clairvoyance, telepathy.
You remember the experiments at Duke university.
One brain transmitting thoughts, the other receiving them.
Well, don't you get it?
Donovan's brain is sending out thoughts.
All I have to do is use my brain to receive them.
Oh, naturally.
Very simple.
Darling, will you do something for me?
Will you go into town and get back issues of magazines and newspapers?
I want every article that has anything to do with Donovan.
Every possible detail of his life.
Will you, baby, please?
Hey, you sober enough?
Will you drive her?
I'm beat.
I want to take that shower you sold me on and sleep.
I'm tired of this space-patrol junk.
All right, all right.
Darling, will you, please?
Sure.
Maybe there's something in the last issue of newsweek.
"Despite his millions,
"Donovan was notoriously antagonistic toward organized charity.
His huge..." hey, you read that one before.
Oh.
How about this?
"The government case against Donovan
"for income tax evasion
"has been in a legal snarl for years.
"Donovan carried to an extreme
"the independence of the self-made man.
"What belonged to him he felt was his and his alone.
"He scorned taxes, fought the payment of every penny.
"Treasury department experts refused comment
"on how the fact that Donovan left no will will affect the status of their case."
Jan, read that one again that gives his description.
"Donovan's strength was in his lined,
"granite-like face and piercing eyes.
"Nephritis had left him in poor physical state.
"He must have been in constant pain,
"because he generally walked with a limp, his right hand soothing his aching kidney."
Yeah, a lot of walking he did with 4 Cadillacs.
I can just see him now, hobbling from the mansion to his car, chewing on a $2 cigar and blowing smoke rings worth a nickel a piece.
Well, thanks for everything, kids.
Night, darling.
Frank.
I'm gonna catch us some nice fresh trout for breakfast.
Want to come along?
No, thanks.
Somebody around here ought to get some sleep.
See you in the morning.
Hey, if you happen to get a message from an old lady with white hair, that's my great aunt marta.
Say I'm out.
Hey! Anybody up?
Look.
3 nights in a row he hasn't been to bed.
She should have married a mattress tester.
Pat.
Hmm?
Pat?
Now, this is silly.
Why didn't you come to bed?
What happened?
A remarkable occurrence,
Dr. Cory.
A thoroughly exhausted man fell asleep.
Now, look.
Why don't we put this on a sensible basis?
Now that Frank's living here, we can take turns, and that way we won't miss a thing, and we can still keep our health.
You write this?
No.
Frank, is this one of your gags?
Did you pull this after I fell asleep?
No. So help me, pat.
How could I?
I was busy catching our breakfast.
What is it, darling?
Where's that picture of Donovan's signature?
I think it's in newsweek.
Newsweek?
Give us a hand, will you, Frank?
Here it is.
We've done it.
Contact with
Donovan's brain at last.
I wonder who Fuller is.
Hi, flower girl.
Finally remembered how bright the sunshine is.
I can't seem to make contact today, so I'm going to check around and try to find out who Fuller is.
I wish you'd stay close by.
Of course, darling.
Won't miss a thing.
Why aren't you in the laboratory?
I told you to watch the oscillograph until I returned.
Don't talk to me like that.
Well, then do as I tell you.
Why don't you stop fooling yourself?
You're not kidding me.
You don't believe that Donovan and Cory have arrived at a meeting of minds?
Not in a million years.
You're blind, Schratt.
Report, please.
Constant glow, same as when you left.
Fabulous. Look.
See the difference?
Now look at the oscillograph.
See? The brain is falling asleep.
That's good.
Let's go in the living room, hmm?
All right, dear.
Pat, Frank and I had a long talk when you were out.
Oh?
We decided that you're carrying this thing too far.
Too far?
Oh, darling, this is only the beginning.
Do you remember our conversation when you came in?
Conversation?
Hmm. Very vaguely.
And you think that's the sign of a healthy mind?
Look, pat, we're both doctors.
We understand autosuggestion, self-hypnosis.
Darling, don't you see?
The limp, the tone of voice.
You're imitating Donovan subconsciously, even to practicing his signature with your left hand.
Oh, Jan, please.
We read you every detail of Donovan's life, and you're so anxious to see this crazy experiment succeed...
What do I have to do to convince you both this Donovan business is on the level?
You'll never convince me.
I expect you any day to send me out for a box of $2 cigars.
You told us that it was an experiment, an investigation of human emotions.
It is.
A search for happiness.
It is all those things, but human emotions exist way deep in the mind.
So far I've only managed a superficial communication with the brain.
Oh, you're off your rocker, pal.
You're way past the brain.
You're looking for the soul.
You're out of your department.
That's why I tell you you're kidding yourself, and if you're not, if you are on the level, then you're trying to play god.
Oh, Frank.
You know I couldn't have gotten this far without...
God's help.
That wins this round, chum, but you wait.
Uh, did you measure today's increase in size?
No, not yet.
I better do it.
I'll be back in a few minutes.
He seems so Sincere.
The mind's a funny thing, Jan.
This Jekyll and Hyde thing, it's weird.
You want me to end it?
How do you mean?
You tell me when, and we'll have an accident.
A fuse in the garage will pop, and 5 minutes later, we'll bury Donovan's brain.
Much as I'd like it,
I want pat to be the one to say when.
Janice, pack my suitcase.
And I'll want the tape recorder.
Where are you going?
To the city.
Why? For how long?
When did you...
Please don't interrupt my train of thought.
While I'm away, increase nourishment to the brain...
Half a pint a day.
Frank, order a taxi, then call the airport and charter a private plane.
Yes, sir?
Suite 612, if it's not occupied.
612? It's available.
For how long?
A week at least.
Possibly longer.
Dr. Cory? It's nice having you with us.
Incidentally, the rate on 612 is 75 a day.
My friend Mr. w.H. Donovan said the rate would be 50.
Oh. That was for Mr. Donovan.
Confidential, we thought.
However...
However, the rate will be $50.
Have the boy take my bags upstairs.
I'll be back later.
Hi, doc. Remember me?
Hey, don't tell me you forgot herbie yocum.
Oh. Hello, yocum.
I just telephoned your house.
Thought maybe I'd run out and pay you a visit, but the missus said you were checking in here.
Call me here later this afternoon, yocum.
I'm late for an appointment now.
Yeah, sure.
You'll have to see the manager... Mr. mcnish.
Mr. mcnish?
Yes?
I was sent to you about this.
Effie.
You have identification, doctor?
Yes, certainly.
Effie, will you get me the signature card of the Roger hinds account and the ledger sheet, please.
Yes, sir.
Have you known
Mr. hinds long, doctor?
Does it matter?
Well, as a matter of fact, to my knowledge, he's never been in the bank.
Naturally, we're a bit curious about him.
All his deposits and withdrawals have been made by mail.
We all have our idiosyncrasies,
Mr. mcnish.
How do you wish to have this cashed, doctor?
Mostly thousands, some hundreds, and a few fifties.
Well, that will just about close the account.
I wouldn't know about that.
You have an office here in the city, doctor?
No, I'm visiting at the town house.
I see.
Well, here you are, sir. $27,000.
May I have an envelope, please?
Certainly, sir.
And if you'd care to open an account...
No, thank you,
Mr. mcnish.
Good day, sir.
Get me the treasury department, bureau of investigation...
A Mr. Brooke. Yes.
Do you have this equipment on hand?
Yeah, I think so.
I want immediate delivery to that address.
If you don't have a truck, hire one.
I don't know about that.
I'll pay double the usual hauling rate, with a $100 bonus for the men on the truck.
How much do I owe you?
I'll have to figure it out.
A rough guess will be good enough.
Well, I'd say, uh, with the tax...
It'd be pretty close to $8,000.
Your firm will absorb the tax, or I'll use my professional connections to make the purchase wholesale, understand?
Have the driver give the change to Mrs. Cory.
$50 of that is for you.
What can I do for you, sir?
I was sent by w.H. Donovan.
Do you have any blue serge with a thin pinstripe?
Yes, sir.
We certainly do.
We had just ordered a bolt especially for Mr. Donovan shortly before...
The accident.
I'll take half a dozen suits.
Certainly, sir.
I want the first one in the morning.
That's impossible, sir.
Not if you put one tailor on the coat, another on the trousers, and have both work all night!
Now, let's get on with my measurements.
Mr. Nathaniel Fuller, please.
Mr. Fuller is in conference.
He'll be tied up until after lunch.
Tell him a friend of w.H. Donovan wants to see him.
Say it's urgent.
But...
Go on.
Excuse me, Mr. Fuller, but there's a gentleman here...
A friend of
Mr. w.H. Donovan's.
Says it's urgent.
Who is he?
Dr. Patrick Cory.
Dr. Patrick Cory.
Cory?
Tell him to come back some other time.
Fuller, I have a message for you from Warren Donovan.
You'll see me now.
Sorry, Mr. Fuller.
Have
Mr. Cory come in.
The first door.
Now, Mr. Cory, what is so urgent?
It's Dr. Cory.
Mr. Fuller, I want you to put through a phone call to Mr. Donovan's
Washington connection.
Tell him to leave
Washington tonight by plane.
You and he will be in my suite,
612 at the town house, at 11:00 tomorrow morning.
I don't know what you're talking about, Dr. Cory.
Do you know who I am?
Frankly, no.
Mr. Donovan died in my home.
Oh, that's right.
No wonder your name sounded slightly familiar.
However, I doubt if Mr. Donovan's connection, as you refer to him, would drop his official duties and come out here on my say-so.
He will when you tell him that certain checks, endorsed by him, are in my possession.
He still wants them, doesn't he?
Now, see here,
Dr. Cory.
Yes, Mr. Fuller?
Do you recognize the handwriting?
Yes, but...
Then follow my instructions,
Mr. Fuller.
Aren't there certain checks with your endorsement, too?
See you in the morning,
Mr. Fuller.
Suite 612.
Get me the long-distance operator.
I want to make a person-to-person call to Washington.
Yes, sir.
612, please.
Yes, sir.
Room service?
This is 612.
Send up a thick steak, porterhouse, rare, charred, asparagus hollandaise, celery hearts, crisp, olives, large ones.
That's right.
No coffee.
No, milk.
Dr. Cory?
My name is Brooke.
Mr. Smith and I are investigators assigned to the treasury department.
May we come in?
Yes, come in. Yeah.
You gentlemen don't waste any time, do you?
Sit down.
You're right, doctor, and we won't waste time...
Ours or yours.
Where did you get the $27,000 check you cashed this morning?
I see no reason to answer that question.
That's a surprising attitude, doctor.
Well, ordinarily
I'd be glad to tell you, but it so happens the money is financing a research project of mine.
The backer said he'd withdraw if his connection became known.
Can you arrange for us to meet this Mr. hinds?
We'll respect his confidence.
Next time I see him,
I'll be glad to relay your request.
Well, doctor, we've been instructed to tell you a little more about this situation.
Thanks.
I'm not interested.
Would you be interested in finding yourself on trial as an accessory to tax fraud?
Prosecuted by the government of the United States?
If you'll give me your card, Mr. Brooke,
I'll have my attorney get in touch with you.
We'd appreciate that, doctor.
Oh, incidentally, what's your attorney's name?
It's unimportant.
He'll introduce himself when he calls.
Room service.
Come in.
Well, gentlemen.
We'll run along, doctor.
And please, we'd rather you keep in touch with us than for us to have to keep in touch with you.
It'll be ready in a moment, sir.
Hiya, doc.
Really living it up, huh?
What is it, yocum?
Remember, doc,
I told you I was broke?
Well, I wrote an article, and I think it's gonna get me a lot of loot.
You mean the one on Mr. Donovan?
Well, sort of, but I got a new slant on it, and it's a dilly.
How does that concern me?
Oh, I thought maybe you'd like to see it.
Good title...
"dead man's living brain."
Is the brain still alive?
Yes.
Say, that's good.
Some editor might want proof.
I can get 10 grand for that.
It's worth it.
Oh, you really think it's good, huh?
It's a good guess, yocum. That's all.
Ah, the public don't care about that.
And I got pictures.
Look.
Here's Donovan in the morgue.
I took the bandages off so you can see the stitches.
Here's Donovan's brain in your lab.
Gee, the missis looks pretty, doesn't she?
That's the one I thought was gonna cost me 6 cents.
Ha ha ha.
Yocum, why go off half-cocked on this thing?
I mean, why not forget this article for a while, and then when the experiment's completed,
I'll collaborate with you.
That's swell, doc, but what do I live on in the meantime?
Will you make me a small advancement?
How small?
Oh, say a couple of grand.
What makes you think
I have that kind of money?
I just happened to be around the bank when you picked up a bundle.
I see.
Pretty sharp, aren't you?
Yocum, have you ever been in trouble?
Not your kind of trouble, no.
You know, stealing a dead man's brain is quite a rap.
A cousin of mine's a lawyer.
He says it's a 5-year stretch, besides losing your medical license.
How do I reach you in case I want to get in touch?
Like I told you...
Yocum, herbie yocum.
The only one in the phone book.
Oh, and keep the copies.
I got plenty.
And picture negatives, too.
See you next week, pal.
Next month.
Well, that depends on how long this lasts.
Happy days, doc.
So long, partner.
Give me the desk.
This is Dr. Cory in 612.
Call Morton flying service and charter a plane to take me to green valley.
No, I'll keep the suite.
I'm coming back in the morning.
Hasn't it the slightest sign of decay?
None. I've never seen healthier tissue.
It's growing larger by the day.
I wonder if he'll be himself.
I doubt it.
It's my guess he's losing himself.
That's what worries me.
Look.
Hmm.
I wonder what effect it's having on him.
Let's go see.
Hello, Frank.
Darling.
Do you control it, or does it control you?
I wouldn't call it control.
I'd say I make my mind receptive, submit to the brain's will.
The brain takes over, that's all.
You know, a strange thing happened this afternoon.
I was sitting in front of the brain concentrating like you do, only, to tell the truth,
I was wishing that thing would die, when suddenly my head began to swim, and I had an eerie feeling that that thing was reading my mind.
That must be the equipment I ordered.
Dr. Cory?
That's right.
Aloe supply.
Oh, yes.
How would you like us to uncrate the stuff outside?
Why mess up the house?
Good idea.
I'll open the back door.
It's closer to the lab.
Ok, doc.
What kind of equipment?
Where did you get the money?
Oh, don't worry about that, dear.
Now, let's see.
There's an automatic feeder which can nourish the brain for a year, amplifiers for increasing the brain's output, a thermostatic temperature control, plus a generator and change-over gimmicks which can supply power in case something happens to the regular power supply.
Might as well get it installed now.
I don't like it, Jan.
He says he submits.
What happens if he can't stop submitting?
Oh, but could that happen?
Why not? That's why it has to stop right now.
Don't talk to him about it until morning, Frank.
He needs a good night's sleep.
It's a little late for talk, Jan.
Stop that!
Pat!
Pat!
Pat! Pat!
Pat! Pat!
What's the matter with you?
Have you lost your mind?
I'm sorry, Frank.
Give me your word not to interfere again.
I was only trying to save you from yourself, pal.
Did I ever try to stop you from having a drink?
This is different.
It's unnatural, unholy.
Well, if it is, then we'll let a higher power decide when it should end.
Cigar counter.
This is Dr. Cory in 612.
Send me some upman cigars.
Box of 50 supremes.
Send out and get them.
Come in.
Well, Mr. advisor himself.
Did you have a pleasant flight, sir?
Yes.
Well, sit down, gentlemen.
Make yourselves comfortable.
I'm sure we've never met, but there's something about you...
Perhaps it's the suit.
Would you gentlemen have some coffee?
That's it. The suit...
Like Donovan's.
But why, Dr. Cory?
Does it matter?
Now, then, it is my understanding that in exchange for certain considerations, you and your Washington connections would handle
Mr. Donovan's tax situation in such a way that...
Donovan's dead, Dr. Cory, and that seems to me...
As I was saying...
In such a way that the statute of limitations would ultimately cause the government's case to be thrown out.
Now you may talk.
Donovan's death released me from any agreement
I may have had.
You're mistaken.
Certain checks endorsed by you ensure that agreement.
Try to understand my position, Dr. Cory.
I felt dirty for many years.
Here was my chance to, well...
I went to my friend the Attorney General and offered to cooperate in exchange for personal immunity.
So you turned on your most powerful backer.
A very touching story.
Be that as it may, you will not clean your conscience at Mr. Donovan's expense.
Is that clear?
Come in.
Oh, yes, yes.
Thank you, thank you.
Cigar?
No, thank you.
Mr. Fuller?
Another reminder, like the suit?
You put it very nicely, sir.
Well?
The Attorney General cannot allow me to reverse my present stand.
That, of course, is your problem.
As I understand it, it requires a quarter of a million dollars to continue with the original plan.
The money will be in your office on the date Mr. Donovan said it would...
As usual, in cash.
I suggest, Mr. advisor, that you carry on.
Is our procedure perfectly clear?
Perfectly.
I'm glad we understand each other.
Gentlemen.
Operator, this is an emergency.
Get me green valley.
114, please, and hurry.
What?
The circuits are busy?
Well, keep trying.
It can't be busy forever.
Still busy?
Oh, Janice.
I've been trying to reach you, but the line is busy.
Darling,
I ache all over with pain, and I don't know why.
I don't know how long it's been, but I can't seem to break contact with Donovan.
Now listen carefully.
I don't know if I'll ever be myself again.
Oh, if the line would only open.
Well, keep trying!
Now, Janice, listen carefully.
I've got to break away from the brain.
I may have to do something desperate.
I... i don't know.
We have to end this thing.
We'll have to take a wild chance.
Now, you know the lightning rod on the roof of the house?
Taxi!
Turn right on Wilshire.
There's a gray sedan following us.
$100 if you lose it.
You got the wrong boy, buddy.
This is my bread and butter.
Hey!
Oh, darling.
Mrs. Cory?
Dr. crane.
Is he out of danger?
He's in no danger,
Mrs. Cory.
The concussion was very mild.
The leg was severely bruised and twisted out of joint.
Just minor injuries.
I doubt it if he'll be here a week.
I feel so much better.
Your husband's an amazing man.
He's shown absolutely no sign of pain.
Oh?
We like to minimize the use of sedatives.
I know.
I used to be a nurse.
The entire staff is baffled.
We can't understand.
I think pat does.
One day, he'll explain it to you.
If he can, he'll amaze me.
Well, Mrs. Cory, he seems to be waking up.
I'll leave him to you.
Darling.
What happened?
Oh, I'm in such pain!
Is this a hospital?
You were in an accident.
You'll be all right in a few days.
Jan, this is unbelievable.
It's very vague, but I think I deliberately walked into that accident.
But why?
I don't know.
To get away from someone,
I think.
I needed time.
Darling...
I'm a little scared.
Several times, I've tried to break contact with Donovan.
I haven't been able to.
I did once, I think.
I did some recording on the tape at the hotel.
Let me tell Frank to turn off the current.
The new apparatus may be too strong.
No. Have him turn it down
10 microvolts.
What are you doing here?
Why aren't you at home?
Why, darling, i...
Go on home where you belong.
Go on, get out!
I'll be there in a few days.
All right, pat.
Anything you say.
Hello?
Yes, I'll accept the call.
Hello, Jan.
Frank, I don't know what to do.
Even pat's worried.
He doesn't seem to be able to throw off the influence of the brain.
I was afraid that would happen.
The brain has hardly quieted down since he left.
He wants you to turn the current down
10 microvolts.
Do it, will you?
And do something else for me, please.
I'm going to stay here in the hospital waiting room.
The number of the phone is Adams 3-9105.
Call me whenever the brain goes to sleep.
I've got to talk to pat again when he's himself.
Sure. Good idea.
Will do.
Dr. Cory, we don't understand what you're trying to do.
Well, didn't mr. Fuller explain?
It made no sense.
Father's dead.
Don't you see?
Tom and I want to cooperate with the government.
They're entitled to the back taxes they want.
How dare you criticize my behavior?
Aren't we entitled to the truth?
It's a terrible thing to say, but dad was an awful man...
Better off dead.
His possessiveness, ugly suspicions, drove mother nearly insane.
He had her committed to an institution because she tried to take her own life.
It took his death for us to get mother out.
So, you hated him, too?
I loathed him.
Most people loathed him.
Get them out of here, Fuller.
See that neither of them gets another dime.
Impossible, doctor.
Not at all.
I have a signed document to that effect.
It'll be on your desk in the morning.
Now, you parasitic ingrates, get out!
Hey, doc.
I read about your accident.
How do you feel?
All right.
Gonna sue the company with the truck that hit you?
I hadn't thought of it.
Let me handle it.
My other cousin's an M.D.
He and the other cousin...
You remember the one I told you about's a lawyer...
They'll rig you up a great case.
You came here for that?
Well, not exactly, doc.
I figured on another advance.
How much this time?
Same amount. 2 grand.
It's been less than a week.
I know it, doc.
I was in hock up to my eyeballs, and I had to buy a car.
How long does this go on?
Oh, just till the article's published.
Tell you what, yocum.
Why don't you get your camera, drive out to the ranch, and take some more pictures of the brain.
Hey, that's a swell idea, and I need some closer shots.
You could leave right now.
I'll phone Schratt and tell him to give you a hand.
Swell, I'll, uh, get the money out of your pocket.
Ah, doc, you're a real pal.
Well, better get on with it.
See ya.
Give me green valley 114.
Jan?
Oh, hello, pat.
Good to hear your voice.
Where's Janice?
Why isn't she there with you?
We're out of groceries, pal.
She's gone downtown.
Now listen, Frank.
You know the photographer yocum?
He's on his way there right now.
Leave him in the lab alone, understand?
10 minutes alone.
Yeah.
The brain?
Perfect, great.
Bigger and better every day.
Good work, Frank.
Thanks.
There you are,
Mr. Fuller.
All cash, including your fee.
Phone Washington.
Say the money's on its way.
Very well, Dr. Cory.
Purchase the cemetery property tomorrow, and the day after,
I'll want to consult with an architect.
It's of great importance...
The construction of this permanent abode, or rather vault, which will perpetually house
Mr. Donovan's... Remains.
I'll do as you say, doctor, but this relationship of you to Donovan is so unnatural, so illogical.
Don't you think
I'm entitled to the truth?
The truth is always dangerous, Mr. Fuller.
In the Donovan situation, it entails great misfortune to all who know.
Believe me, your ignorance is insurance for personal safety.
Mr. Donovan intends to dominate the international financial scene, and a fatal accident will occur to all who happen to stand in his way.
Good day, sir.
A fatal accident will occur to anyone who stands in his way.
Frank and Janice...
They stand in my way.
Pat made that recording while the brain was destroying yocum.
That proves the brain can only dominate one person at a time.
But at the rate it's growing, do you think that'll always be so?
Who knows?
Honestly, Jan, we shouldn't wait.
Any minute now, that thing may get the power to paralyze us all.
You have another plan?
Mm-hmm, but I don't want to discuss it in here.
Let's step outside.
Why all the way out here?
I don't know.
I feel better outside.
Jan, pat may never get away from the brain.
It's up to us now.
But pat wouldn't harm us.
Donovan would... the minute we get in his way.
But murder... i can't believe that pat...
But yocum's death was no accident.
Donovan engineered it.
Then the same thing could happen to us.
Donovan could kill us the same way he killed yocum.
That's right, and it's too dangerous to wait any longer.
Now, when pat gets back home, it's up to you to keep him outside here.
Hold him.
Make him angry...
So angry the brain won't know what I'm doing.
Well, what's that?
I'll be in the laboratory.
Oh, it's a nightmare.
Do you think it'll work?
It has to, Jan.
The brain is very powerful, but we know it can only concentrate on one thing at a time.
We've proved that over and over again.
Frank...
What'll happen to pat?
I mean, if we kill the brain...
The brain is Donovan.
Frank...
Has Donovan become so much a part of pat?
I mean, could pat die?
Who knows?
This whole thing is beyond experience.
It's a gamble.
You don't have him now anyway.
Frank.
It has to be done, Jan.
Welcome home, darling.
Well, I'm happy to be here.
I've missed you, my dear.
My friend yocum show up?
Frank saw him.
Too bad about the accident.
Yes.
Tuttle told us they just found him.
How did you know?
I must've heard it somewhere.
I haven't seen you in so long, darling.
I mean, couldn't we take a little walk or something?
You look as though you haven't had a breath of fresh air in days.
A walk?
Of course.
The exercise will do you good.
Besides, you'll work up an appetite.
Please, pat.
Oh, but, Janice, surely it's going to rain.
And besides...
All right, my dear.
Let's take a walk.
Smell the rain coming?
How fresh the air is before a shower.
You know, Janice, you were always a very devoted wife.
Were?
But I still am.
And you've been a wonderful husband.
Thank you, my dear.
Oh, pat, look at me.
Look at me, please.
What?
Look at me, pat.
You can be free if you have faith.
Patrick.
What is this idiocy, Janice?
All right.
We can stop pretending now.
You're not Patrick Cory.
You're something evil living in his body.
But whatever your plan is, you'll never get away with it.
The experiment's over.
You're right.
It is over.
From now on, Warren Donovan is a living fact.
There's no further need for the instruments who gave him life.
The services of Schratt,
Cory, and yourself are no longer required.
Then you'll be the one to go, Mr. Donovan...
Just as you should've gone weeks ago.
No!
What are you doing?
No!
Let go of me!
Let go! Let go!
Let go.
Darling, are you all right?
Y-yes, Jan.
I'm so glad.
Let's go inside.
Frank!
Surprised?
You forgot, my dear, that you and Frank are ordinary people with limited mental capacities.
You couldn't possibly compete with a fully developed and powerful brain.
Thanks to
Dr. Patrick Cory,
Donovan's brain will live, thrive, and continue to grow far beyond the body of Dr. Cory.
It is already able to exist in anybody, anywhere at will.
Knowing this, you now know too much...
So look at my brain, my dear...
Your last look.
I promise you it will not be a painful one.
Ohh!
Good afternoon, Mrs. Cory.
Is the doctor ready?
He'll be right with you,
Mr. Brooke.
Is he feeling better?
Much better, thanks.
Good.
Um, Mr. Brooke, what do you think about...
I mean...
How long do you suppose he'll be gone?
Well, I'm sorry.
It's hard to say.
It depends on whether there's an indictment.
Well, they do know it was pat's plan to end this thing by hooking the lightning rod into the power supply.
They know that, don't they?
It's all on the tape recorder, Mrs. Cory.
Of course, a great deal will hinge on the decision of the medical board as to the ethics of the experiment and the validity of the results.
Well, we'll get turned around.
Mr. Brooke has the valise, dear.
Did you find the files on last year?
Everything...
All charts and notes.
We're covered on practically every minute since we first started research...
Thanks to you, dear.
Hurry back.
I'll try.
But they can't blame you... they can't.
Jan, I went into this with my eyes open, but it got out of hand, and I did many foolish things...
Things that made other people suffer.
I'm only grateful the storm struck when it did, and that Frank survived.
Will he be well enough to help you testify?
I hope so.
Maybe if everything works out, they can use another country doctor around here.
No, dear.
You're a scientist and always will be.
I love you very much.
Let's go, pal.
